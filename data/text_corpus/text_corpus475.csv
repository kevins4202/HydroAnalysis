2375,owing to the binary geologic structure soil loss in the karst region is characterized as a combination of surface erosion and underground soil loss however we know little about the process and amount of underground soil loss by now due to the difficulty in observation and identification to predict soil loss accurately and control rocky desertification effectively it is urgent to collect data of underground soil loss directly by new ways in this study 137cs tracer technique high frequency online monitoring and uav survey were used to investigate soil loss through fissures the soil samples were collected in five karst caves of guizhou province for determining 137cs activity in two of these caves the improved monitoring devices were adopted to monitor drip water online and the sediment content in drip water was measured once a month furthermore depending on 5 exposed karst sections the distribution density of fissures was surveyed with uav to calculate the average underground soil loss modulus in the watershed the results showed that 1 the soil materials deposited in caves were mainly transported by runoff from the cave entrance rather than through fissures above the caves 2 the initial response time and duration of drip water in caves to rainfall were controlled by surface land coverage and the process of precipitation and the variation of sediment content in drip water kept almost constant with rainfall except at the beginning of the rainy season 3 the directly measured underground soil loss rate monitored through the fissure above a cave with high bedrock exposure rate and a cave with high vegetation coverage was 2 42 g yr 1 and 0 36 g yr 1 respectively 4 the average underground soil loss modulus in the area with high bedrock exposure rate and with high vegetation coverage was 0 35 t km 2 yr 1 and 0 05 t km 2 yr 1 respectively this study is helpful for understanding the process and intensity of underground soil loss keywords underground soil loss drip water cave soil sediment content karst fissure 137cs data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the karst region of southwest china centered in guizhou province is the greatest continuous karst region in the world goldscheider et al 2020 jiang et al 2014 li et al 2016 soil resource in there is limited and the damage caused by erosion is extremely serious because of a slow rate of soil formation according to the results from wang et al 1999 and yuan and cai 1988 it will need 63 to 850 thousand years to form 1 m soil due to only a little soil forming material retained after the dissolution of carbonate rocks therefore it is very difficult to restore the ecology in karst region once severe soil erosion leads to rocky desertification which hinders the sustainable development of the social economy consequently jiang et al 2014 wang et al 2004 zhang et al 2016 unfortunately soil erosion in karst region is not only serious but also complex in process because soil suffered from surface erosion and lost via fissures to underground simultaneously underground soil loss dai et al 2018 wang et al 2014 wei et al 2016 yang et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 owing to the unique dual geological structure originating from abundant precipitation and lithological characters worthington 2009 yan et al 2019 furthermore underground soil loss is more complex and elusive and is more difficult to be monitored and controlled compared with the surface erosion although there were many studies on underground soil loss in recent decades the results on the contribution ratio of underground soil loss to the total erosion varied widely because of a lack in the direct data from field measurements cheng et al 2020 dai et al 2018 feng et al 2020 gan et al 2020 hence it is impending to find a new way to directly investigate the intensity of underground soil loss and its factors for predicting soil loss rationally and controlling soil loss effectively in the karst region as the large tunnel karst caves offer an opportunity to observe the underground soil loss directly owing to its vast spaces to deposit the lost soil wang et al 2014 zhou et al 2012 generally the soil in caves originates from three ways including the post weathering material from the bedrock of the cave the surface soil moved into cave via fissures and the surface soil transported into caves by runoff or animals through the cave entrance in the past few decades 137cs as a tracer has been successfully applied to study soil erosion processes and intensity cao et al 2020 li et al 2010 xiong et al 2018 therefore 137cs is also a good tool to trace sediment sources deposited in the caves and to distinguish whether the sediments were transported into caves via fissures or entrances no matter in surface erosion process on the slope or soil loss process in fissures soil particles is transported by runoff therefore rainfall infiltrating into fissures is a dominate factor to determine soil loss via fissures underground soil loss depending on observation of drip water in caves underground runoff and sediments via fissures can be calculated although there are many studies on the isotopes chemical elements and metallic elements in cave drip water lyu et al 2020 pu et al 2015 tooth and fairchild 2003 warken et al 2022 few reported on the underground soil loss by monitoring drip water so far in this study 137cs tracer technique high frequency online monitoring and uav survey were used to investigate soil loss through fissures the soil samples were collected in five caves c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 for determining 137cs activity in the most typical karst areas of guizhou province in two of these caves c1 c2 drip water was monitored by the improved monitoring device and the sediment content in drip water was measured about once a month furthermore the distribution density of fissures based on 5 karst sections s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 was surveyed with uav to calculate average underground soil loss modulus the objectives of this paper were 1 to primarily determine the origin of cave soil and the intensity of underground soil loss by determining 137cs 2 to explore the responses of drip water and sediment contents to rainfall and 3 to estimate the underground soil loss modulus using the data of directly observed sediment and the distribution density of fissures the results will provide significant and direct supporting to understand the process and estimate the intensity of underground soil loss in karst regions 2 material and methods 2 1 site description the studied caves and fissures are located in the most typical karst areas in anshun city and qianxinan bouyei and miao autonomous prefecture guizhou fig 1 in these areas soil layer is thin and discontinuous on the surface and most soil is distributed in low lying sites such as fissures and grikes li et al 2020a li et al 2020b the soil type belongs to luvisol based on world reference base system iuss working group wrb 2015 and it is calcareous soil or yellow soil according to chinese soil taxonomy in addition the bed rocks commonly expose on surface and fissures and underground streams are prevailing due to the highly dissolved carbonate rocks as marked in fig 1 c1 and c2 are located in zhenfeng county qianxinan bouyei and miao autonomous prefecture with an average annual rainfall of 1313 mm and an average annual temperature of 18 4 c the land use type where c1 located is mainly cropland planted with zanthoxylum with low vegetation coverage the average thickness of soil outside the cave is only 10 cm and the exposed rate of bedrock is more than 70 there is no any shelter or barrier at the entrance 3 5 m in height 11 m in width and the runoff could flow from the entrance into c1 freely the cave soil layer at the monitoring site is about 6 cm the celling of cave at the drip monitoring site is 4 5 m in height from the bottom of the cave and the thickness of the cave roof is 42 m the hillslope where c2 located is covered by 17 cm depth soil layer with lush shrubs the surface runoff can flow from the entrance 18 m in height 25 m in width to c2 and transport lots of soils into the cave resulting in the 48 cm depth cave soil the height of cave celling at the monitoring site is about 27 m and the thickness of the cave roof is about 30 m c3 is located in xixiu district anshun city with a mean annual temperature of 15 c and a mean annual precipitation of 1350 mm the land use type on the slope is mainly shrubwood and it was cropland about 20 years ago the entrance of the cave is located in the middle hillside at a depression and surrounded by stones consequently the soil and water outside the cave couldn t flow into through the entrance during the recent decades c4 and c5 are located in guanling county anshun city the mean annual temperature is 16 2 c and the mean annual rainfall is 1268 mm the hillslope where c4 located grows crops and shrubs the entrance of the cave is 1193 m high above sea level 25 48 48 n 105 35 15 e and surrounded by rocks which can prevent runoff flowing into cave through the entrance compared with other caves water drip points are abundant and new calcium carbonate is easy to deposit in the cave the thickness of the overlying bedrock is about 30 to 85 m the entrance of c5 is located at 1220 m above sea level 25 48 28 n 105 35 28 e and there is no rocks surrounded resulting that surface runoff can flow into cave freely the soil layer outside c5 was about 18 cm in depth and the land was cultivated as cropland the rock stratum above the cave is thin and the cave hall is small there are lots of drip points in the cave while less soil accumulation 2 2 field sampling and monitoring in july 2020 soil outside the cave cave soil near the entrance and soil deposited in cave were collected with 3 duplicate samples for the five caves respectively in addition additional one sample was collected respectively from the walls of c3 c4 and c5 and from the drip water for c1 and c2 in total 20 samples were collected to determine 137cs activity from march 28 2021 to april 20 2022 the improved monitoring devices were used to monitor and collect cave drip water in c1 and c2 fig 2 in the device an auto recording rain gauge davis 6466 m davis instruments usa was placed to capture water drips and to record the fluctuant process of the drip water during a storm and a plastic container with a capacity of 36 l was placed below the gauge to collect the total water the sediment content of the drip water was measured in the plastic container using an optical turbidity sensor about once a month in addition a weather station atmos meter group inc usa was used to record rainfall and air temperature outside the caves in march 2022 five exposed karst sections at quarries were photographed by uav in total 217 aerial photographs were obtained from different angles and applied to construct the 3d models of the exposed sections using smart3d 4 0 and then the 3d models were imported into acute3d viewer fig 1 and the horizontal widths of the sections and the number of fissures in the sections were measured depending on the measured parameters above the mean distribution density of fissures in the study areas were calculated 2 3 lab measurements firstly soil samples were air dried disaggregated and passed through a 2 mm nylon sieve then 137cs were measured in beijing normal university during september and november 2020 in total 137cs activity of 20 samples was measured using gamma spectrometry with a hyperpure n type coaxial germanium detector gmx 50p4 coupled to an ortec amplifier and multichannel analyzer cao et al 2020 the counting time was at least 33 000 s the 661 6 kev peak on the spectrum was used for the 137cs analysis and the measurement precision was less than 5 at the 90 confidence level and the minimum detectable activity was 0 5 bq kg 1 137cs activity bq kg 1 was calculated as follows 137cs activity narea w t c 1000 1 where narea is the net peak area of 137cs w is the sample weight g t is the counting time s and c is the detection efficiency of 137cs 2 4 data processing 2 4 1 software used for data processing all statistical parameters were analyzed using microsoft excel microsoft office usa matlab mathworks usa and spss 22 0 international business machines corporation usa figures were plotted and analyzed using origin 2018 originlab usa arcmap 10 3 environment system research institute usa and coreldraw x7 corel canada the 3d models of the exposed karst sections were constructed using smart3d 4 0 and the 3d models were analyzed using acute3d viewer 2 4 2 calculation of underground soil loss modulus for underground soil loss soil materials are transported down to caves or underground rivers through fissures dai et al 2018 wang et al 2014 peng and dai 2022 therefore the distribution density of fissures has crucial impacts on underground soil loss hence surveying fissures is a key to calculating the underground soil loss per unit area of land in the study area the depths of the 64 fissures in the 5 karst sections ranged from 0 5 to 5 7 m with an average of 1 9 m and a coefficient of variation of 49 the widths of these fissures ranged from 0 05 to 0 96 m and the mean value and coefficient of variation is 0 23 m and 67 respectively the underground soil loss modulus was calculated as follows r m f 106 2 f n i w i 2 3 where r is the underground soil loss modulus t km 2 yr 1 m is the underground soil loss rate annual soil mass in cave drip water g yr 1 f is the number of fissures per square kilometer w is the horizontal width of the section km n is the number of the fissure in the karst section and i is the i th karst section 3 results 3 1 preliminary determination of the cave soil source as shown in fig 3 the concentrations of 137cs in the soils outside the five caves ranged from 0 58 to 4 51 bq kg 1 with an average of 2 77 bq kg 1 much higher than the concentrations of soils deposited in caves the concentrations of 137cs in soils showed a decrease trend from the outside to the deeper of the caves normally 137cs in cave is mainly from the surface soil outside the cave transported by runoff animal and aerosol klimchouk and gudzenko 1996 no runoff has flowed through the entrance into c3 and c4 since 1963 because they are surrounded by stones as a consequence the concentrations of 137cs existed in cave soil near the entrances of c3 and c4 were only 0 71 and 0 52 bq kg 1 respectively while the concentrations in cave soil near the entrances of c1 c2 and c5 reached 2 17 2 93 and 2 27 bq kg 1 respectively owing to the influence of runoff animal and aerosol in addition the concentrations of 137cs in cave soil far away from the entrances of c2 and c5 were 0 97 and 0 57 bq kg 1 respectively however no 137cs was detected at the higher site far from the entrance of c1 runoff through the cave entrance has not reached the site since 1963 this phenomenon indicates that the runoff outside the cave passing through the entrance mainly contributes to the 137cs activity in cave soil with a decreased influence on 137cs activity from the entrance to deep cave by animals and air the viewpoint was also supported by the fact that 137cs in soil adhered to cave walls and in drip water were both less than the minimum detectable activity 0 5 bq kg 1 and the same results were also reported by wei et al 2016 so we further believed that the soil deposited in caves is mainly transported into cave by runoff flowing through the cave entrance 3 2 the response of cave drip water to rainfall 3 2 1 dynamic characteristics of cave drip water as shown in fig 4 the total rainfall was 1060 80 mm concentrated mainly in may to october in total 164 rainfall events were recorded during the monitoring period in addition rainfall events with rainfall of 0 2 5 mm 5 10 mm 10 20 mm and more than 20 mm accounted for 64 17 1 12 2 and 6 7 respectively in addition 17 886 mm of cave drip water was measured by the rain gauge at the monitoring site in c1 with an average daily drip volume of 46 5 mm the daily volume at this site kept relatively invariable but increased after a rainfall event and kept in a high value for a long time when rainfall stopped in the meantime 1824 6 mm of drip water was measured at the monitoring site in c2 but the average daily drip volume was only 4 7 mm far less than that in c1 the daily volume at this site fluctuated widely with a coefficient of variation as high as 5 76 from may to october 2021 the volume of drip water at the two sites both increased under the heavy and concentrated rainfall condition in contrast drip water changed little and kept a low volume during a dry season from november to april of the following year the results indicated that there was a great effect of rainfall on drip water 3 2 2 responses of cave drip water to rainfall events on the basis of the data of cave drip water and rainfall we investigated drip water in caves at the two sites for 9 typical rainfall events fig 5 we judged whether drip water responded to rainfall by the variation of drip water after a rainfall event and the response process was counted from the beginning of drip water increment and then decreasing to the normal value according to the above judging rules we found that drip water in c1 and c2 started to increase 6 18 h and 6 78 h after a rainfall beginning and generally lasted for 3 8 days and 3 16 5 days respectively the beginning response time of drip water in c1 to rainfall was earlier than that in c2 but the duration was shorter than that in c2 however the drip water in c1 and c2 both responded quickly under a condition of heavy rainfall occurred from april 14 to april 15 in 2022 in addition the drip water volume was far larger than the usual volume in c2 and even much larger than that in c1 on this occasion from may to october 2021 57 rainfall events less than 10 mm were recorded of which only one event with 9 2 mm rainfall had an impact on the drip water in c1 due to its long interval with the last event there were 18 rainfall events greater than 10 mm of which almost all had a distinctly impact on drip water in c1 except for the event with a 16 4 mm rainfall owing to a rainfall event just 3 days ago from november to april of the following year no variation of drip water was found in c1 for the rainfall less than 5 mm for the 24 rainfall events greater than 5 mm 3 rainfall events had no effects on drip water in c1 due to a short interval with the last rainfall event and there were obvious increments in the volume of drip water in c1 for the rest of the rainfall events for c2 in the middle of the rainy season from july 14 to september 2 2021 the rainfall events from 0 2 to 30 6 mm had no impacts on the volume of drip water but for the rest of the monitoring time drip water in c2 responded to all rainfall greater than 5 mm the results above indicated that the initial response time and duration of drip water to rainfall was different in different caves and the critical rainfall that caused the change in drip water also varied in different caves and rainfall contexts 3 3 soil loss through fissures 3 3 1 dynamic variations of drip water responding to rainfall in order to relate the drip water and sediment in caves to rainfall the whole monitoring period was divided into 9 stages based on the monitoring times of sediment content of drip water according to the data of sediment content and the auto monitored drip water the soil loss through fissures at each stage was calculated daily rainfall mean temperature and drip rate were calculated at each stage based on auto monitoring data fig 6 the results showed that the trends of drip rate in c1 and c2 were roughly similar with the rainfall distribution during the monitoring period but the drip rate in c2 reached its peak on august 13 which was one month later than the rainfall as well as the drip rate in c1 3 3 2 dynamic variations in sediment content depending on the data measured by the turbidity sensor the sediment content of the drip water in c1 ranged from 3 22 to 16 47 mg l 1 with an average of 7 47 mg l 1 the sediment content in the water measured on may 4 the beginning of rainy season was much higher than that at other stages however the sediment content measured on june 7 decreased sharply compared with the previous stage and then the sediment in drip water increased again to its peak on august 13 from the last of august the sediment content showed a decreased trend till the following april besides there is a small peak about sediment content of drip in c1 on november 10 the sediment content of the drip water in c2 ranged from 3 84 to 122 46 mg l 1 with an average of 25 43 mg l 1 the variation trend of sediment content in the drip water of c2 was roughly similar to c1 but there were three differences as follows firstly the sediment content of drip water in c2 did not decreased as sharply as that in c1 at the beginning of the rainy season secondly the sediment content of c2 reached its peak one month later than c1 during the rainy season lastly there was no small peak on november 10 in c2 3 3 3 dynamic variations in soil loss through fissures during the whole monitoring period only 2 57 g sediment was detected at the monitoring site in c1 and the underground soil loss rate ranged from 1 06 to 5 81 g yr 1 with an average of 2 42 g yr 1 the total underground soil loss at the monitoring site in c2 was as less as 0 38 g during the monitoring period and the underground soil loss rate ranged from 0 07 to 0 92 g yr 1 with an average of 0 36 g yr 1 the variation trend of underground soil loss rate in c1 was almost consistent with its sediment content meanwhile the underground soil loss rate in c2 only reached its peak on september 14 and april 19 due to a frequent and heavy rainfall but no marked peak at other times nevertheless no matter c1 or c2 the direct soil loss passing through fissures was very little measured in this study in order to evaluate the underground soil loss at a watershed scale the distribution density of fissures was necessary according to 3d modeling analysis from drone aided survey data equation 3 was used to calculate the average number of fissures per square kilometer in the study area as 144 573 and the average underground soil loss modulus of c1 and c2 was 0 35 t km 2 yr 1 and 0 05 t km 2 yr 1 respectively based on equation 2 4 discussions 4 1 factors affecting variations in drip water and sediment content there were several factors determining the responses of drip water in caves to rainfall such as vegetation rainfall exposure rate of rock on surface firstly vegetation above the cave affects the response of drip water to rainfall greatly because there is high vegetation coverage on the land above c2 rainfall was firstly intercepted by the canopy and then flowed down the stem or felled down to the surface as larger rain drops secondly rainfall was absorbed partially by litters after they reached ground lastly the remained water was transported to underground space through fissures yang et al 2019 by contrast because there is less vegetation on the surface of c1 rainfall directly fell to ground and partly flowed down along slope and partly infiltrated down along fissures to increase drip water in the cave as a result the initial response time of drip water in c1 to rainfall was earlier than that in c2 moreover the vegetation above c2 can keep providing water to the fissure for a long time due to its water retaining character resulting in a longer response duration of drip water in c2 than that in c1 rainfall amount is another factor to affect the variations in drip rate greatly water stored in underground fissures is the main source of cave drip water genty and deflandre 1998 williams 1983 when it rains the water pressure head will increase consequently resulting in the water stored in the karst fissures being pressed out and the drip rate increasing rapidly pu et al 2014 tooth and fairchild 2003 depending on our investigation only rainfall was more than 10 mm in the rainy season and more than 5 mm in the dry season could increase the drip rate in c1 and in most of the time it took more than 5 mm of rainfall to increase the drip rate in c2 accordingly the critical rainfall relating to the increase of the drip rate was necessary which was also reported by genty and deflandre 1998 on the other hand the interval time of two rainfall events also had effects on the response of drip water to rainfall event in the middle of the rainy season from july 14 to september 2 2021 the events with a rainfall ranging from 0 2 to 30 6 mm did not increase the drip rate in c2 meanwhile some rainfall events with a rainfall greater than 10 mm in the rainy season and greater than 5 mm in the dry season also did not drive the drip rate in c1 because of the short interval from the previous rainfall event furthermore the critical rainfall caused the variation of drip rate in c1 in the rainy season was 10 mm but 5 mm in the dry season in our opinions the short interval of rainfall events caused more and more water to be stored in the fissure requiring a higher water pressure head higher rainfall to discharge the water exposed rocks on the slope can also affect the volume of drip water in caves by enhancing rainfall infiltration firstly bare rocks could redistribute precipitation to nearby fissures and increase the soil water content during a rain storm conn and snyder conn 1981 li et al 2014 wang et al 2016 reported that the water of soil received from rock surface runoff equaled to the volume received directly from precipitation when the area of bare rocks reached 70 of the ground surface meaning that the soil distributed among bare rocks captured twice as much precipitation as that on no rock land secondly bare rock enhanced drip water in caves by hindering surface runoff and adding infiltration consequently additionally porous karst topography also availed higher infiltration for water to pass the underground fissure network quickly to the caves green et al 2014 peng and wang 2012 since the bedrock exposure rate above c1 is much higher than that above c2 more precipitation was received in c1 than that in c2 and formed a larger of drip water volumes than that in c2 accordingly vegetation bare rock and rainfall process also have deep effects on sediment content by affecting drip water firstly the variation trend of sediment content in the drip water of c2 was roughly similar to c1 but there were three differences as concluded above context due to the dense vegetation above c2 and the high exposure rate of bare rock above c1 secondly the sediment content in drip water changed with rainfall generally water can be enclosed for a longer duration in fissures or karst pipes during the dry season more carbonate rocks was dissolved into water as sediment white 2019 so the sediment content in the water measured on may 4 the beginning of rainy season was much higher than that at other stages however the sediment content measured on june 7 decreased sharply compared with the previous stage because the sediment stored in fissures had been diluted by the rapid infiltrated water again and again owing to an abundant rainfall at this stage and then along with rainy day coming more and more soil was transported into caves through fissures the sediment in drip water increased again to its peak on august 13 from the last of august the sediment content showed a decreased trend till the following april as rainfall decreased besides there is a small peak about sediment content of drip in c1 due to a sudden increase about rainfall on november 10 therefore based on the study of the two caves vegetation bare rock and rainfall process affects underground runoff and sediment content thoroughly 4 2 assessment of underground soil loss during the whole monitoring period only 2 57 g sediment was directly detected at the monitoring site in the cave covered by high exposure rate of bedrock and the average underground soil loss rate was 2 42 g yr 1 the total underground soil loss was 0 38 g at the monitoring site in the densely vegetated cave and the average underground soil loss rate was only 0 36 g yr 1 although there were some differences between the two caves with a different condition about ground coverage the actually measured amounts of underground soil loss were small to reflect the underground soil loss intensity more intuitively we converted the underground soil loss rate g yr 1 into underground soil loss modulus t km 2 yr 1 by investigating the distribution density of fissures with the aid of uav the results showed that the average underground soil loss modulus was 0 35 t km 2 yr 1 in the high bedrock exposure area and it was 0 05 t km 2 yr 1 in the densely vegetated area li et al 2012 found that underground soil loss modulus of the watershed with high vegetation cover was 0 42 t km 2 yr 1 and yue 2016 also found that the underground soil loss rate was 3 24 g yr 1 0 47 t km 2 yr 1 in underground soil loss modulus estimated by collecting soil in drip water from the cave with high bedrock exposure rate the above outcomes showed that the underground soil loss modulus was relatively higher in karst areas with low vegetation coverage and high rock exposure or vice versa however the underground soil loss modulus was very low regardless of the surface land coverage above the cave this was also consistent with the measurements of 137cs in different sites of the five caves in this study in karst regions soil could be eroded into the underground space via fissures indeed owing to the special dual geological structure and abundant precipitation however the occurrence of underground soil loss requires not only precipitation but also sufficient space for soil transportation fissures are always filled with soil materials and few fissures are completely empty although vegetation and bare rock have effects on underground runoff and sediment content by affecting the redistribution of precipitation the soil properties soil permeability soil macropore ph in fissures and fissure characteristics carbonate rock dissolution rate length of the fissure the connection between fissure and underground space also influenced on underground soil loss profoundly therefore the underground soil loss studied by different methods varies in different areas firstly due to the high clay content in fissure soil li et al 2020a li et al 2020b feng et al 2020 yan et al 2019 tiny clay particles gradually fill and plug the soil pores in the fissure under the action of water which makes it difficult for lots of soil to lose via fissures in addition yan et al 2019 found that shallow fissures mainly ranged from 80 to 160 cm in depth and li et al 2020a li et al 2020b believed the average depth of the epikarst fissures was 260 16 cm based on the investigation of 64 excavated fissures in such a long fissure filled with soil it is very difficult for water and soil to discharge into the underground space xiong et al 2012 and feng et al 2011 believed that soil mainly moved to the underground river through sinkhole and only a small part of soil is lost from fissures to the underground space wei et al 2016 and li et al 2020a li et al 2020b calculated the contribution ratio of underground soil loss to the total soil erosion using 137cs tracer method and composite fingerprint technique and the ratios were only 4 5 and 22 1 respectively moreover although the dissolved rocks could provide space for underground soil loss when the lower part of the fissure is closed the carbonate rocks formed before the triassic in southwest china are dense hard and dissolve very slowly wang et al 2014 wall and jenkyns 2004 dai and yan 2018 and fang et al 2022 also suggested that underground soil loss on slopes was a long time series process resulting in less soil moved downwards in fissures in a short time which was also the reason that underground soil loss contributed little to soil erosion in karst areas however karst systems are characterized by high heterogeneity some researchers have considered that underground soil loss dominates soil loss in karst areas dai et al 2017 yang et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 peng et al 2019 luo et al 2018 found the contribution ratio of underground soil loss to the total soil erosion was more than 38 68 cheng et al 2020 estimated the underground soil loss ratio as 68 using composite fingerprint technique soil in fissures close to the earth surface has good permeability and organic acids secreted by plant roots can accelerate the dissolution of carbonate rocks feng et al 2020 calculated the potential underground soil loss modulus as high as 275 2 t km 2 yr 1 based on the dissolution rate of limestone without considering distribution density of the fissures meanwhile soil clay minerals mainly comprised by kaolin and vermiculite are prone to dehydration and cracking in the dry condition valášková 2015 which accelerate the movement of soil particles under rainfall dai et al 2018 found the underground soil loss ratio was more than 44 by conducting simulated rainfall experiment according to peng and dai 2022 underground soil loss depends on the development degree of karst fissures and the connection of the lower part of the fissure therefore the underground soil loss would be large when the fissures are short and water can discharge from the end of the fissures 4 3 limitations of the study in this work 137cs tracer technique high resolution online monitoring uav investigation and 3d modeling were innovatively applied to study the process and intensity of underground soil loss which made some supplements to the research of underground soil loss we believe that some of the unique key conclusions will provide great contributions in understanding underground soil loss in karst regions however there still are two limitations to the study inevitably firstly although uav and 3d modeling was innovatively applied to investigate the distribution density of fissures the calculated underground soil loss modulus may not completely reflect the fact owing to the difference of development degree between the fissures monitored by uav and the fissures monitored by drip secondly a fewer caves and fissures were investigated in this work the factors affecting underground soil loss include precipitation vegetation bare rock material filled in the fissure and the development degree of the fissure resulting in the varied underground soil loss rates in different fissures then it is necessary to extend the study area and increase the number of monitoring objects in the future research 5 conclusions depending on the cave soil sampling online monitoring to drip water in caves and aerial survey to karst fissures by uav the main source of soils deposited in caves the response of drip water and sediment to rainfall and the intensity of soil loss passing through fissures were studied in this study the following main points can be summarized 1 there was no 137cs in soils deposited in the caves no matter on the wall on the bottom or in the drip water indicating that the soils in caves were not affected by surface runoff passing fissures but mainly affected by runoff from the cave entrance and only a little proportion of the soil entered the cave via fissures 2 vegetation and bare rock were important factors to affect the initial response time and duration of drip water to rainfall by influencing the redistribution of precipitation in the cave with high ground vegetation coverage the initial response time of drip water to rainfall was late but the response duration was longer in contrast the cave with high bedrock exposure rate on ground resulted in the more drip water volume the faster initial response time and the shorter response duration owing to a high infiltration rate on ground 3 there was a critical rainfall needed for driving the increment of drip water the drip water responded to rainfall only under the conditions at which rainfall was greater than 10 mm in the rainy season and greater than 5 mm in the dry season for the cave with high bedrock exposure rate for the cave with high vegetation coverage during the concentrated and heavy rain days the rainfall events less than 30 6 mm had no impacts on the drip water but for the rest of the monitoring time drip water in this cave responded to all rainfall greater than 5 mm in addition the short interval of rainfall events resulted in a larger rainfall to discharge the water stored in the fissure 4 the sediment content in the drip water showed the same trend with rainfall fluctuation however at the beginning of the rainy season the sediment content in drip water was much higher than that in other periods because more carbonate rocks was dissolved into water during the dry season although the sediment content of drip water in the cave with high vegetation coverage was higher than that in the cave with high bedrock exposure rate the underground soil loss from the densely vegetated cave was small due to the smaller precipitation infiltration 5 the directly measured underground soil loss rate in the cave with high bedrock exposure rate and the cave with high vegetation coverage was 2 42 g yr 1 and 0 36 g yr 1 respectively in the study area there were about 144 573 fissures per square kilometers land the average underground soil loss modulus in the area with high bedrock exposure was higher than the area with high vegetation coverage which was 0 35 t km 2 yr 1 and 0 05 t km 2 yr 1 respectively credit

2375,owing to the binary geologic structure soil loss in the karst region is characterized as a combination of surface erosion and underground soil loss however we know little about the process and amount of underground soil loss by now due to the difficulty in observation and identification to predict soil loss accurately and control rocky desertification effectively it is urgent to collect data of underground soil loss directly by new ways in this study 137cs tracer technique high frequency online monitoring and uav survey were used to investigate soil loss through fissures the soil samples were collected in five karst caves of guizhou province for determining 137cs activity in two of these caves the improved monitoring devices were adopted to monitor drip water online and the sediment content in drip water was measured once a month furthermore depending on 5 exposed karst sections the distribution density of fissures was surveyed with uav to calculate the average underground soil loss modulus in the watershed the results showed that 1 the soil materials deposited in caves were mainly transported by runoff from the cave entrance rather than through fissures above the caves 2 the initial response time and duration of drip water in caves to rainfall were controlled by surface land coverage and the process of precipitation and the variation of sediment content in drip water kept almost constant with rainfall except at the beginning of the rainy season 3 the directly measured underground soil loss rate monitored through the fissure above a cave with high bedrock exposure rate and a cave with high vegetation coverage was 2 42 g yr 1 and 0 36 g yr 1 respectively 4 the average underground soil loss modulus in the area with high bedrock exposure rate and with high vegetation coverage was 0 35 t km 2 yr 1 and 0 05 t km 2 yr 1 respectively this study is helpful for understanding the process and intensity of underground soil loss keywords underground soil loss drip water cave soil sediment content karst fissure 137cs data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the karst region of southwest china centered in guizhou province is the greatest continuous karst region in the world goldscheider et al 2020 jiang et al 2014 li et al 2016 soil resource in there is limited and the damage caused by erosion is extremely serious because of a slow rate of soil formation according to the results from wang et al 1999 and yuan and cai 1988 it will need 63 to 850 thousand years to form 1 m soil due to only a little soil forming material retained after the dissolution of carbonate rocks therefore it is very difficult to restore the ecology in karst region once severe soil erosion leads to rocky desertification which hinders the sustainable development of the social economy consequently jiang et al 2014 wang et al 2004 zhang et al 2016 unfortunately soil erosion in karst region is not only serious but also complex in process because soil suffered from surface erosion and lost via fissures to underground simultaneously underground soil loss dai et al 2018 wang et al 2014 wei et al 2016 yang et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 owing to the unique dual geological structure originating from abundant precipitation and lithological characters worthington 2009 yan et al 2019 furthermore underground soil loss is more complex and elusive and is more difficult to be monitored and controlled compared with the surface erosion although there were many studies on underground soil loss in recent decades the results on the contribution ratio of underground soil loss to the total erosion varied widely because of a lack in the direct data from field measurements cheng et al 2020 dai et al 2018 feng et al 2020 gan et al 2020 hence it is impending to find a new way to directly investigate the intensity of underground soil loss and its factors for predicting soil loss rationally and controlling soil loss effectively in the karst region as the large tunnel karst caves offer an opportunity to observe the underground soil loss directly owing to its vast spaces to deposit the lost soil wang et al 2014 zhou et al 2012 generally the soil in caves originates from three ways including the post weathering material from the bedrock of the cave the surface soil moved into cave via fissures and the surface soil transported into caves by runoff or animals through the cave entrance in the past few decades 137cs as a tracer has been successfully applied to study soil erosion processes and intensity cao et al 2020 li et al 2010 xiong et al 2018 therefore 137cs is also a good tool to trace sediment sources deposited in the caves and to distinguish whether the sediments were transported into caves via fissures or entrances no matter in surface erosion process on the slope or soil loss process in fissures soil particles is transported by runoff therefore rainfall infiltrating into fissures is a dominate factor to determine soil loss via fissures underground soil loss depending on observation of drip water in caves underground runoff and sediments via fissures can be calculated although there are many studies on the isotopes chemical elements and metallic elements in cave drip water lyu et al 2020 pu et al 2015 tooth and fairchild 2003 warken et al 2022 few reported on the underground soil loss by monitoring drip water so far in this study 137cs tracer technique high frequency online monitoring and uav survey were used to investigate soil loss through fissures the soil samples were collected in five caves c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 for determining 137cs activity in the most typical karst areas of guizhou province in two of these caves c1 c2 drip water was monitored by the improved monitoring device and the sediment content in drip water was measured about once a month furthermore the distribution density of fissures based on 5 karst sections s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 was surveyed with uav to calculate average underground soil loss modulus the objectives of this paper were 1 to primarily determine the origin of cave soil and the intensity of underground soil loss by determining 137cs 2 to explore the responses of drip water and sediment contents to rainfall and 3 to estimate the underground soil loss modulus using the data of directly observed sediment and the distribution density of fissures the results will provide significant and direct supporting to understand the process and estimate the intensity of underground soil loss in karst regions 2 material and methods 2 1 site description the studied caves and fissures are located in the most typical karst areas in anshun city and qianxinan bouyei and miao autonomous prefecture guizhou fig 1 in these areas soil layer is thin and discontinuous on the surface and most soil is distributed in low lying sites such as fissures and grikes li et al 2020a li et al 2020b the soil type belongs to luvisol based on world reference base system iuss working group wrb 2015 and it is calcareous soil or yellow soil according to chinese soil taxonomy in addition the bed rocks commonly expose on surface and fissures and underground streams are prevailing due to the highly dissolved carbonate rocks as marked in fig 1 c1 and c2 are located in zhenfeng county qianxinan bouyei and miao autonomous prefecture with an average annual rainfall of 1313 mm and an average annual temperature of 18 4 c the land use type where c1 located is mainly cropland planted with zanthoxylum with low vegetation coverage the average thickness of soil outside the cave is only 10 cm and the exposed rate of bedrock is more than 70 there is no any shelter or barrier at the entrance 3 5 m in height 11 m in width and the runoff could flow from the entrance into c1 freely the cave soil layer at the monitoring site is about 6 cm the celling of cave at the drip monitoring site is 4 5 m in height from the bottom of the cave and the thickness of the cave roof is 42 m the hillslope where c2 located is covered by 17 cm depth soil layer with lush shrubs the surface runoff can flow from the entrance 18 m in height 25 m in width to c2 and transport lots of soils into the cave resulting in the 48 cm depth cave soil the height of cave celling at the monitoring site is about 27 m and the thickness of the cave roof is about 30 m c3 is located in xixiu district anshun city with a mean annual temperature of 15 c and a mean annual precipitation of 1350 mm the land use type on the slope is mainly shrubwood and it was cropland about 20 years ago the entrance of the cave is located in the middle hillside at a depression and surrounded by stones consequently the soil and water outside the cave couldn t flow into through the entrance during the recent decades c4 and c5 are located in guanling county anshun city the mean annual temperature is 16 2 c and the mean annual rainfall is 1268 mm the hillslope where c4 located grows crops and shrubs the entrance of the cave is 1193 m high above sea level 25 48 48 n 105 35 15 e and surrounded by rocks which can prevent runoff flowing into cave through the entrance compared with other caves water drip points are abundant and new calcium carbonate is easy to deposit in the cave the thickness of the overlying bedrock is about 30 to 85 m the entrance of c5 is located at 1220 m above sea level 25 48 28 n 105 35 28 e and there is no rocks surrounded resulting that surface runoff can flow into cave freely the soil layer outside c5 was about 18 cm in depth and the land was cultivated as cropland the rock stratum above the cave is thin and the cave hall is small there are lots of drip points in the cave while less soil accumulation 2 2 field sampling and monitoring in july 2020 soil outside the cave cave soil near the entrance and soil deposited in cave were collected with 3 duplicate samples for the five caves respectively in addition additional one sample was collected respectively from the walls of c3 c4 and c5 and from the drip water for c1 and c2 in total 20 samples were collected to determine 137cs activity from march 28 2021 to april 20 2022 the improved monitoring devices were used to monitor and collect cave drip water in c1 and c2 fig 2 in the device an auto recording rain gauge davis 6466 m davis instruments usa was placed to capture water drips and to record the fluctuant process of the drip water during a storm and a plastic container with a capacity of 36 l was placed below the gauge to collect the total water the sediment content of the drip water was measured in the plastic container using an optical turbidity sensor about once a month in addition a weather station atmos meter group inc usa was used to record rainfall and air temperature outside the caves in march 2022 five exposed karst sections at quarries were photographed by uav in total 217 aerial photographs were obtained from different angles and applied to construct the 3d models of the exposed sections using smart3d 4 0 and then the 3d models were imported into acute3d viewer fig 1 and the horizontal widths of the sections and the number of fissures in the sections were measured depending on the measured parameters above the mean distribution density of fissures in the study areas were calculated 2 3 lab measurements firstly soil samples were air dried disaggregated and passed through a 2 mm nylon sieve then 137cs were measured in beijing normal university during september and november 2020 in total 137cs activity of 20 samples was measured using gamma spectrometry with a hyperpure n type coaxial germanium detector gmx 50p4 coupled to an ortec amplifier and multichannel analyzer cao et al 2020 the counting time was at least 33 000 s the 661 6 kev peak on the spectrum was used for the 137cs analysis and the measurement precision was less than 5 at the 90 confidence level and the minimum detectable activity was 0 5 bq kg 1 137cs activity bq kg 1 was calculated as follows 137cs activity narea w t c 1000 1 where narea is the net peak area of 137cs w is the sample weight g t is the counting time s and c is the detection efficiency of 137cs 2 4 data processing 2 4 1 software used for data processing all statistical parameters were analyzed using microsoft excel microsoft office usa matlab mathworks usa and spss 22 0 international business machines corporation usa figures were plotted and analyzed using origin 2018 originlab usa arcmap 10 3 environment system research institute usa and coreldraw x7 corel canada the 3d models of the exposed karst sections were constructed using smart3d 4 0 and the 3d models were analyzed using acute3d viewer 2 4 2 calculation of underground soil loss modulus for underground soil loss soil materials are transported down to caves or underground rivers through fissures dai et al 2018 wang et al 2014 peng and dai 2022 therefore the distribution density of fissures has crucial impacts on underground soil loss hence surveying fissures is a key to calculating the underground soil loss per unit area of land in the study area the depths of the 64 fissures in the 5 karst sections ranged from 0 5 to 5 7 m with an average of 1 9 m and a coefficient of variation of 49 the widths of these fissures ranged from 0 05 to 0 96 m and the mean value and coefficient of variation is 0 23 m and 67 respectively the underground soil loss modulus was calculated as follows r m f 106 2 f n i w i 2 3 where r is the underground soil loss modulus t km 2 yr 1 m is the underground soil loss rate annual soil mass in cave drip water g yr 1 f is the number of fissures per square kilometer w is the horizontal width of the section km n is the number of the fissure in the karst section and i is the i th karst section 3 results 3 1 preliminary determination of the cave soil source as shown in fig 3 the concentrations of 137cs in the soils outside the five caves ranged from 0 58 to 4 51 bq kg 1 with an average of 2 77 bq kg 1 much higher than the concentrations of soils deposited in caves the concentrations of 137cs in soils showed a decrease trend from the outside to the deeper of the caves normally 137cs in cave is mainly from the surface soil outside the cave transported by runoff animal and aerosol klimchouk and gudzenko 1996 no runoff has flowed through the entrance into c3 and c4 since 1963 because they are surrounded by stones as a consequence the concentrations of 137cs existed in cave soil near the entrances of c3 and c4 were only 0 71 and 0 52 bq kg 1 respectively while the concentrations in cave soil near the entrances of c1 c2 and c5 reached 2 17 2 93 and 2 27 bq kg 1 respectively owing to the influence of runoff animal and aerosol in addition the concentrations of 137cs in cave soil far away from the entrances of c2 and c5 were 0 97 and 0 57 bq kg 1 respectively however no 137cs was detected at the higher site far from the entrance of c1 runoff through the cave entrance has not reached the site since 1963 this phenomenon indicates that the runoff outside the cave passing through the entrance mainly contributes to the 137cs activity in cave soil with a decreased influence on 137cs activity from the entrance to deep cave by animals and air the viewpoint was also supported by the fact that 137cs in soil adhered to cave walls and in drip water were both less than the minimum detectable activity 0 5 bq kg 1 and the same results were also reported by wei et al 2016 so we further believed that the soil deposited in caves is mainly transported into cave by runoff flowing through the cave entrance 3 2 the response of cave drip water to rainfall 3 2 1 dynamic characteristics of cave drip water as shown in fig 4 the total rainfall was 1060 80 mm concentrated mainly in may to october in total 164 rainfall events were recorded during the monitoring period in addition rainfall events with rainfall of 0 2 5 mm 5 10 mm 10 20 mm and more than 20 mm accounted for 64 17 1 12 2 and 6 7 respectively in addition 17 886 mm of cave drip water was measured by the rain gauge at the monitoring site in c1 with an average daily drip volume of 46 5 mm the daily volume at this site kept relatively invariable but increased after a rainfall event and kept in a high value for a long time when rainfall stopped in the meantime 1824 6 mm of drip water was measured at the monitoring site in c2 but the average daily drip volume was only 4 7 mm far less than that in c1 the daily volume at this site fluctuated widely with a coefficient of variation as high as 5 76 from may to october 2021 the volume of drip water at the two sites both increased under the heavy and concentrated rainfall condition in contrast drip water changed little and kept a low volume during a dry season from november to april of the following year the results indicated that there was a great effect of rainfall on drip water 3 2 2 responses of cave drip water to rainfall events on the basis of the data of cave drip water and rainfall we investigated drip water in caves at the two sites for 9 typical rainfall events fig 5 we judged whether drip water responded to rainfall by the variation of drip water after a rainfall event and the response process was counted from the beginning of drip water increment and then decreasing to the normal value according to the above judging rules we found that drip water in c1 and c2 started to increase 6 18 h and 6 78 h after a rainfall beginning and generally lasted for 3 8 days and 3 16 5 days respectively the beginning response time of drip water in c1 to rainfall was earlier than that in c2 but the duration was shorter than that in c2 however the drip water in c1 and c2 both responded quickly under a condition of heavy rainfall occurred from april 14 to april 15 in 2022 in addition the drip water volume was far larger than the usual volume in c2 and even much larger than that in c1 on this occasion from may to october 2021 57 rainfall events less than 10 mm were recorded of which only one event with 9 2 mm rainfall had an impact on the drip water in c1 due to its long interval with the last event there were 18 rainfall events greater than 10 mm of which almost all had a distinctly impact on drip water in c1 except for the event with a 16 4 mm rainfall owing to a rainfall event just 3 days ago from november to april of the following year no variation of drip water was found in c1 for the rainfall less than 5 mm for the 24 rainfall events greater than 5 mm 3 rainfall events had no effects on drip water in c1 due to a short interval with the last rainfall event and there were obvious increments in the volume of drip water in c1 for the rest of the rainfall events for c2 in the middle of the rainy season from july 14 to september 2 2021 the rainfall events from 0 2 to 30 6 mm had no impacts on the volume of drip water but for the rest of the monitoring time drip water in c2 responded to all rainfall greater than 5 mm the results above indicated that the initial response time and duration of drip water to rainfall was different in different caves and the critical rainfall that caused the change in drip water also varied in different caves and rainfall contexts 3 3 soil loss through fissures 3 3 1 dynamic variations of drip water responding to rainfall in order to relate the drip water and sediment in caves to rainfall the whole monitoring period was divided into 9 stages based on the monitoring times of sediment content of drip water according to the data of sediment content and the auto monitored drip water the soil loss through fissures at each stage was calculated daily rainfall mean temperature and drip rate were calculated at each stage based on auto monitoring data fig 6 the results showed that the trends of drip rate in c1 and c2 were roughly similar with the rainfall distribution during the monitoring period but the drip rate in c2 reached its peak on august 13 which was one month later than the rainfall as well as the drip rate in c1 3 3 2 dynamic variations in sediment content depending on the data measured by the turbidity sensor the sediment content of the drip water in c1 ranged from 3 22 to 16 47 mg l 1 with an average of 7 47 mg l 1 the sediment content in the water measured on may 4 the beginning of rainy season was much higher than that at other stages however the sediment content measured on june 7 decreased sharply compared with the previous stage and then the sediment in drip water increased again to its peak on august 13 from the last of august the sediment content showed a decreased trend till the following april besides there is a small peak about sediment content of drip in c1 on november 10 the sediment content of the drip water in c2 ranged from 3 84 to 122 46 mg l 1 with an average of 25 43 mg l 1 the variation trend of sediment content in the drip water of c2 was roughly similar to c1 but there were three differences as follows firstly the sediment content of drip water in c2 did not decreased as sharply as that in c1 at the beginning of the rainy season secondly the sediment content of c2 reached its peak one month later than c1 during the rainy season lastly there was no small peak on november 10 in c2 3 3 3 dynamic variations in soil loss through fissures during the whole monitoring period only 2 57 g sediment was detected at the monitoring site in c1 and the underground soil loss rate ranged from 1 06 to 5 81 g yr 1 with an average of 2 42 g yr 1 the total underground soil loss at the monitoring site in c2 was as less as 0 38 g during the monitoring period and the underground soil loss rate ranged from 0 07 to 0 92 g yr 1 with an average of 0 36 g yr 1 the variation trend of underground soil loss rate in c1 was almost consistent with its sediment content meanwhile the underground soil loss rate in c2 only reached its peak on september 14 and april 19 due to a frequent and heavy rainfall but no marked peak at other times nevertheless no matter c1 or c2 the direct soil loss passing through fissures was very little measured in this study in order to evaluate the underground soil loss at a watershed scale the distribution density of fissures was necessary according to 3d modeling analysis from drone aided survey data equation 3 was used to calculate the average number of fissures per square kilometer in the study area as 144 573 and the average underground soil loss modulus of c1 and c2 was 0 35 t km 2 yr 1 and 0 05 t km 2 yr 1 respectively based on equation 2 4 discussions 4 1 factors affecting variations in drip water and sediment content there were several factors determining the responses of drip water in caves to rainfall such as vegetation rainfall exposure rate of rock on surface firstly vegetation above the cave affects the response of drip water to rainfall greatly because there is high vegetation coverage on the land above c2 rainfall was firstly intercepted by the canopy and then flowed down the stem or felled down to the surface as larger rain drops secondly rainfall was absorbed partially by litters after they reached ground lastly the remained water was transported to underground space through fissures yang et al 2019 by contrast because there is less vegetation on the surface of c1 rainfall directly fell to ground and partly flowed down along slope and partly infiltrated down along fissures to increase drip water in the cave as a result the initial response time of drip water in c1 to rainfall was earlier than that in c2 moreover the vegetation above c2 can keep providing water to the fissure for a long time due to its water retaining character resulting in a longer response duration of drip water in c2 than that in c1 rainfall amount is another factor to affect the variations in drip rate greatly water stored in underground fissures is the main source of cave drip water genty and deflandre 1998 williams 1983 when it rains the water pressure head will increase consequently resulting in the water stored in the karst fissures being pressed out and the drip rate increasing rapidly pu et al 2014 tooth and fairchild 2003 depending on our investigation only rainfall was more than 10 mm in the rainy season and more than 5 mm in the dry season could increase the drip rate in c1 and in most of the time it took more than 5 mm of rainfall to increase the drip rate in c2 accordingly the critical rainfall relating to the increase of the drip rate was necessary which was also reported by genty and deflandre 1998 on the other hand the interval time of two rainfall events also had effects on the response of drip water to rainfall event in the middle of the rainy season from july 14 to september 2 2021 the events with a rainfall ranging from 0 2 to 30 6 mm did not increase the drip rate in c2 meanwhile some rainfall events with a rainfall greater than 10 mm in the rainy season and greater than 5 mm in the dry season also did not drive the drip rate in c1 because of the short interval from the previous rainfall event furthermore the critical rainfall caused the variation of drip rate in c1 in the rainy season was 10 mm but 5 mm in the dry season in our opinions the short interval of rainfall events caused more and more water to be stored in the fissure requiring a higher water pressure head higher rainfall to discharge the water exposed rocks on the slope can also affect the volume of drip water in caves by enhancing rainfall infiltration firstly bare rocks could redistribute precipitation to nearby fissures and increase the soil water content during a rain storm conn and snyder conn 1981 li et al 2014 wang et al 2016 reported that the water of soil received from rock surface runoff equaled to the volume received directly from precipitation when the area of bare rocks reached 70 of the ground surface meaning that the soil distributed among bare rocks captured twice as much precipitation as that on no rock land secondly bare rock enhanced drip water in caves by hindering surface runoff and adding infiltration consequently additionally porous karst topography also availed higher infiltration for water to pass the underground fissure network quickly to the caves green et al 2014 peng and wang 2012 since the bedrock exposure rate above c1 is much higher than that above c2 more precipitation was received in c1 than that in c2 and formed a larger of drip water volumes than that in c2 accordingly vegetation bare rock and rainfall process also have deep effects on sediment content by affecting drip water firstly the variation trend of sediment content in the drip water of c2 was roughly similar to c1 but there were three differences as concluded above context due to the dense vegetation above c2 and the high exposure rate of bare rock above c1 secondly the sediment content in drip water changed with rainfall generally water can be enclosed for a longer duration in fissures or karst pipes during the dry season more carbonate rocks was dissolved into water as sediment white 2019 so the sediment content in the water measured on may 4 the beginning of rainy season was much higher than that at other stages however the sediment content measured on june 7 decreased sharply compared with the previous stage because the sediment stored in fissures had been diluted by the rapid infiltrated water again and again owing to an abundant rainfall at this stage and then along with rainy day coming more and more soil was transported into caves through fissures the sediment in drip water increased again to its peak on august 13 from the last of august the sediment content showed a decreased trend till the following april as rainfall decreased besides there is a small peak about sediment content of drip in c1 due to a sudden increase about rainfall on november 10 therefore based on the study of the two caves vegetation bare rock and rainfall process affects underground runoff and sediment content thoroughly 4 2 assessment of underground soil loss during the whole monitoring period only 2 57 g sediment was directly detected at the monitoring site in the cave covered by high exposure rate of bedrock and the average underground soil loss rate was 2 42 g yr 1 the total underground soil loss was 0 38 g at the monitoring site in the densely vegetated cave and the average underground soil loss rate was only 0 36 g yr 1 although there were some differences between the two caves with a different condition about ground coverage the actually measured amounts of underground soil loss were small to reflect the underground soil loss intensity more intuitively we converted the underground soil loss rate g yr 1 into underground soil loss modulus t km 2 yr 1 by investigating the distribution density of fissures with the aid of uav the results showed that the average underground soil loss modulus was 0 35 t km 2 yr 1 in the high bedrock exposure area and it was 0 05 t km 2 yr 1 in the densely vegetated area li et al 2012 found that underground soil loss modulus of the watershed with high vegetation cover was 0 42 t km 2 yr 1 and yue 2016 also found that the underground soil loss rate was 3 24 g yr 1 0 47 t km 2 yr 1 in underground soil loss modulus estimated by collecting soil in drip water from the cave with high bedrock exposure rate the above outcomes showed that the underground soil loss modulus was relatively higher in karst areas with low vegetation coverage and high rock exposure or vice versa however the underground soil loss modulus was very low regardless of the surface land coverage above the cave this was also consistent with the measurements of 137cs in different sites of the five caves in this study in karst regions soil could be eroded into the underground space via fissures indeed owing to the special dual geological structure and abundant precipitation however the occurrence of underground soil loss requires not only precipitation but also sufficient space for soil transportation fissures are always filled with soil materials and few fissures are completely empty although vegetation and bare rock have effects on underground runoff and sediment content by affecting the redistribution of precipitation the soil properties soil permeability soil macropore ph in fissures and fissure characteristics carbonate rock dissolution rate length of the fissure the connection between fissure and underground space also influenced on underground soil loss profoundly therefore the underground soil loss studied by different methods varies in different areas firstly due to the high clay content in fissure soil li et al 2020a li et al 2020b feng et al 2020 yan et al 2019 tiny clay particles gradually fill and plug the soil pores in the fissure under the action of water which makes it difficult for lots of soil to lose via fissures in addition yan et al 2019 found that shallow fissures mainly ranged from 80 to 160 cm in depth and li et al 2020a li et al 2020b believed the average depth of the epikarst fissures was 260 16 cm based on the investigation of 64 excavated fissures in such a long fissure filled with soil it is very difficult for water and soil to discharge into the underground space xiong et al 2012 and feng et al 2011 believed that soil mainly moved to the underground river through sinkhole and only a small part of soil is lost from fissures to the underground space wei et al 2016 and li et al 2020a li et al 2020b calculated the contribution ratio of underground soil loss to the total soil erosion using 137cs tracer method and composite fingerprint technique and the ratios were only 4 5 and 22 1 respectively moreover although the dissolved rocks could provide space for underground soil loss when the lower part of the fissure is closed the carbonate rocks formed before the triassic in southwest china are dense hard and dissolve very slowly wang et al 2014 wall and jenkyns 2004 dai and yan 2018 and fang et al 2022 also suggested that underground soil loss on slopes was a long time series process resulting in less soil moved downwards in fissures in a short time which was also the reason that underground soil loss contributed little to soil erosion in karst areas however karst systems are characterized by high heterogeneity some researchers have considered that underground soil loss dominates soil loss in karst areas dai et al 2017 yang et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 peng et al 2019 luo et al 2018 found the contribution ratio of underground soil loss to the total soil erosion was more than 38 68 cheng et al 2020 estimated the underground soil loss ratio as 68 using composite fingerprint technique soil in fissures close to the earth surface has good permeability and organic acids secreted by plant roots can accelerate the dissolution of carbonate rocks feng et al 2020 calculated the potential underground soil loss modulus as high as 275 2 t km 2 yr 1 based on the dissolution rate of limestone without considering distribution density of the fissures meanwhile soil clay minerals mainly comprised by kaolin and vermiculite are prone to dehydration and cracking in the dry condition valášková 2015 which accelerate the movement of soil particles under rainfall dai et al 2018 found the underground soil loss ratio was more than 44 by conducting simulated rainfall experiment according to peng and dai 2022 underground soil loss depends on the development degree of karst fissures and the connection of the lower part of the fissure therefore the underground soil loss would be large when the fissures are short and water can discharge from the end of the fissures 4 3 limitations of the study in this work 137cs tracer technique high resolution online monitoring uav investigation and 3d modeling were innovatively applied to study the process and intensity of underground soil loss which made some supplements to the research of underground soil loss we believe that some of the unique key conclusions will provide great contributions in understanding underground soil loss in karst regions however there still are two limitations to the study inevitably firstly although uav and 3d modeling was innovatively applied to investigate the distribution density of fissures the calculated underground soil loss modulus may not completely reflect the fact owing to the difference of development degree between the fissures monitored by uav and the fissures monitored by drip secondly a fewer caves and fissures were investigated in this work the factors affecting underground soil loss include precipitation vegetation bare rock material filled in the fissure and the development degree of the fissure resulting in the varied underground soil loss rates in different fissures then it is necessary to extend the study area and increase the number of monitoring objects in the future research 5 conclusions depending on the cave soil sampling online monitoring to drip water in caves and aerial survey to karst fissures by uav the main source of soils deposited in caves the response of drip water and sediment to rainfall and the intensity of soil loss passing through fissures were studied in this study the following main points can be summarized 1 there was no 137cs in soils deposited in the caves no matter on the wall on the bottom or in the drip water indicating that the soils in caves were not affected by surface runoff passing fissures but mainly affected by runoff from the cave entrance and only a little proportion of the soil entered the cave via fissures 2 vegetation and bare rock were important factors to affect the initial response time and duration of drip water to rainfall by influencing the redistribution of precipitation in the cave with high ground vegetation coverage the initial response time of drip water to rainfall was late but the response duration was longer in contrast the cave with high bedrock exposure rate on ground resulted in the more drip water volume the faster initial response time and the shorter response duration owing to a high infiltration rate on ground 3 there was a critical rainfall needed for driving the increment of drip water the drip water responded to rainfall only under the conditions at which rainfall was greater than 10 mm in the rainy season and greater than 5 mm in the dry season for the cave with high bedrock exposure rate for the cave with high vegetation coverage during the concentrated and heavy rain days the rainfall events less than 30 6 mm had no impacts on the drip water but for the rest of the monitoring time drip water in this cave responded to all rainfall greater than 5 mm in addition the short interval of rainfall events resulted in a larger rainfall to discharge the water stored in the fissure 4 the sediment content in the drip water showed the same trend with rainfall fluctuation however at the beginning of the rainy season the sediment content in drip water was much higher than that in other periods because more carbonate rocks was dissolved into water during the dry season although the sediment content of drip water in the cave with high vegetation coverage was higher than that in the cave with high bedrock exposure rate the underground soil loss from the densely vegetated cave was small due to the smaller precipitation infiltration 5 the directly measured underground soil loss rate in the cave with high bedrock exposure rate and the cave with high vegetation coverage was 2 42 g yr 1 and 0 36 g yr 1 respectively in the study area there were about 144 573 fissures per square kilometers land the average underground soil loss modulus in the area with high bedrock exposure was higher than the area with high vegetation coverage which was 0 35 t km 2 yr 1 and 0 05 t km 2 yr 1 respectively credit

zheng school of resources and environmental engineering hefei university of technology hefei 230009 china submarine groundwater discharge sgd is an important component of the local and regional hydrologic cycles affecting coastal water quality and ecology however the influence of subsurface physical barriers widely built in coastal aquifers for seawater intrusion control has not yet been fully understood with respect to the downstream sgd in this study we used both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations to quantify the contribution of subsurface physical barriers to the fresh and saline sgd fluxes different types of physical barriers including cutoff wall and subsurface dam were examined with various structures e g barrier location height or penetration depth the results demonstrated that subsurface physical barriers with different structures resulted in various changes in the location of the freshwater discharge at the aquifer sea interface e g the discharge location shifted seaward as the cutoff wall moved inland the water exchange across the aquifer sea interface was closely related to the structure of subsurface physical barriers with the increase in the height of subsurface dam or the increase in the depth of cutoff wall the fresh and saline sgd fluxes revealed a decreasing trend generally the presence of a physical barrier hindered the hydraulic connection between the upstream and downstream aquifers and the sgd fluxes were reduced compared to those without any barrier for cutoff walls the change in wall depths led to decreases in tide induced saltwater circulation of 25 33 density driven saltwater circulation of 10 30 fresh groundwater discharge of 17 60 and the total efflux of 18 36 within the effective height range of the subsurface dam fresh and saline sgd fluxes peaked at the minimum effective height these findings provide a general framework for the prediction and monitoring of sgd behavior in coastal aquifers where subsurface physical barriers are intended or have been constructed keywords submarine groundwater discharge saltwater intrusion subsurface physical barriers tide unconfined aquifer data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater in coastal aquifers is discharged into the ocean through the seabed of continental margins generally termed as submarine groundwater discharge sgd rodellas et al 2015 as an important component of the local regional and global hydrologic cycles it is important for different aspects and subject to an interdisciplinary field of research moosdorf et al 2021 for example sgd carries large quantities of land derived chemicals into the sea while participating in groundwater flow across the land sea interface zhang et al 2020 in addition to the standard pathways e g atmospheric deposition and rivers sgd has been identified as a critical and underestimated source of freshwater nutrients heavy metals carbon trace elements and organic pollutants for coastal waters with its contribution probably higher than river inputs robinson et al 2018 santos et al 2021 global scale estimations of sgd propose that sgd derived dissolved inorganic nitrogen and dissolved inorganic phosphorus fluxes are 1 4 and 1 6 times the riverine inputs to the global ocean respectively cho et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 therefore sgd has significant implications for the water quality ecosystems and primary productivity in the coastal ocean sawyer et al 2016 the sgd comprises terrestrial freshwater and recirculated seawater and can be divided into three components according to the driving forces fig 1 a i e tide or wave induced saltwater circulation fresh groundwater discharge and density driven saltwater circulation kuan et al 2019 fluctuations in sea level caused by tides or waves form an upper saline plume usp at the intertidal zone in the upper aquifer and a saltwater circulation occurs within the usp and is defined as tide induced saltwater circulation fang et al 2022 seawater intrudes inland along the aquifer base seawater intrusion which is caused by the density difference between freshwater and seawater lu and werner 2013 lu et al 2019 seawater intrusion generates a saltwater wedge sw and saltwater circulation termed as density driven saltwater circulation in the lower aquifer zheng et al 2021 terrestrial fresh groundwater flows into the ocean through a freshwater tube between the sw and usp sgd components impact one another and there are correlations among the sgd components theoretical research of robinson et al 2007a suggested that tide induced circulation decreased and density driven circulation increased with the increase of fresh groundwater discharge the salinity distribution in coastal aquifers also affects the fluxes of sgd components robinson et al 2007b found that the size of the sw and thickness of the salt freshwater mixing zone around the sw influenced the flux of density driven circulation the above sgd characteristics and salinity distribution have been well confirmed by previous field monitoring studies numerical simulations and laboratory experiments fang et al 2021a heiss and michael 2014 santos et al 2021 yan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 in the last few decades to protect fresh groundwater resource subsurface physical barriers have been constructed in coastal areas to prevent the intrusion of seawater fig 1b for example as early as 1988 the u s army corps of engineers built subsurface physical barriers in new orleans aimed to block seawater intrusion from the gulf of mexico mcanally and pritchard 1997 japan has constructed at least seven physical barriers in coastal aquifers to limit the inland intrusion of seawater luyun et al 2009 similar engineering practices also occur in other coastal countries such as china india the middle east and some african countries armanuos et al 2019 2020 a growing number of engineering applications have shown that building physical barriers is a technically feasible and effective solution to control seawater intrusion chang et al 2022 zheng et al 2022 the construction of subsurface physical barriers hinders the hydraulic connection between upstream and downstream aquifers and further affects the shape and size of the usp sw and freshwater discharge channel thus eventually determining the fluxes of sgd and its components fang et al 2021a although increasing applications of subsurface physical barriers are occurring in coastal areas there is still very little scientific understanding of how physical barriers affect the water exchange across the aquifer sea interface the existing body of research on subsurface physical barriers pays more attention to the effectiveness of fresh groundwater protection upstream of the barrier and ignores the downstream groundwater behaviors chang et al 2022 kang et al 2021 ke et al 2021 sun et al 2021 zheng et al 2022 therefore the sea boundary is usually simplified in these studies the beach is perpendicular to the aquifer base and sea level is set to static conditions ignoring ocean forces such as tides regarding sgd tide induced saltwater circulation does not exist owing to these simplifications only the flux of fresh groundwater discharge is concerned as it is related to the self purification capacity of the aquifer upstream of a physical barrier fang et al 2021b the surveys such as that conducted by kang et al 2021 have shown that a decline in fresh groundwater discharge was observed after the construction of subsurface physical barriers thus decreasing the load of nitrate from the upstream aquifer discharged into the ocean studies of zheng et al 2021 2022 show the importance of fresh groundwater discharge for purifying residual saltwater trapped in the upstream aquifer while subsurface physical barrier related research focuses on aspects in the upstream area of the barrier the traditional research on sgd tends to study the zone around the aquifer sea interface and neglects the implication of subsurface physical barriers built in the aquifer santos et al 2021 therefore there is a knowledge gap in the intersecting fields of subsurface physical barriers and sgd and that is a systematic understanding of how subsurface physical barriers contribute to sgd and its components is still lacking in this study laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were combined to investigate the effect of subsurface physical barriers on downstream salinity distribution and sgd fluxes different types of physical barriers including cutoff wall and subsurface dam and parameters involving barrier location height or penetration depth were examined laboratory experiments were carried out in a controlled sand tank which allowed for precise observation of the seawater intrusion process and the validation of the numerical model based on laboratory data the numerical model was used to conduct a sensitivity analysis of the structure of physical barrier and clarify its relationship to sgd fluxes the results of these experiments and simulations provide a decisive foundation for the prediction and monitoring of sgd behaviors in coastal aquifers where subsurface physical barriers are intended to be or have been constructed 2 material and methods 2 1 laboratory experiments to observe groundwater behavior in coastal aquifers a sand tank was used for laboratory experiments fig 2 a this device has previously been tested and successfully used to explore the processes of seawater intrusion under the combined effect of tides and a subsurface dam fang et al 2021b the sand tank simulated a vertical two dimensional profile of the coastal aquifer with specific dimensions of 172 9 cm length 45 cm height 8 cm width from left to right two porous partitions divided the sand tank into three parts saltwater chamber central chamber and freshwater chamber the saltwater chamber was connected to a tidal device of variable height overflow vho via multiple rubber hoses at the bottom and the fluctuations of the water level in the vho synchronously drove the change in water level in the saltwater chamber in this study a power system consisting of an electric motor an iron turntable and a steering gear was used to drive the vho device to fluctuate periodically up and down thereby causing a sinusoidal fluctuation of the water level in the saltwater chamber over time following equation 1 1 h t h msl a sin 2 π t t where h t l is the sea level at time t t hmsl l is the mean sea level and a l and t t are the tidal amplitude and period respectively based on the field data of zhang et al 2021 the mean sea level was set to 23 8 cm height from the tank base and the tidal amplitude and period were preset to 2 cm and 1 min respectively fresh groundwater discharge from the central chamber would dilute the saltwater concentration in the saltwater chamber to address this problem we constantly added seawater of an adequate concentration to the saltwater chamber to maintain a uniform salinity of 35 g l the addition of the required seawater was determined by monitoring the salinity in the saltwater chamber during the experiment a portable meter hq40d portable ec meter hach inc was used every 5 min to measure the electrical conductivity of the seawater the central chamber was filled with white quartz sand representing an unconfined aquifer the quartz sand had a uniform particle size d 50 0 5 mm and d 90 d 10 2 6 after sieving and the porosity was 0 4 using one dimensional column experiments fang et al 2021b the average hydraulic conductivity and longitudinal dispersivity were measured to be 2 8 10 3 m s and 0 001 m respectively soil saturation and pressure were also measured by installing moisture sensors and tensiometers to fit the van genuchten curve van genuchten 1980 constants a and n in the van genuchten functions were 14 5 m 1 and 2 68 respectively and the residual water saturation was determined as 0 025 the artificial aquifer possessed a sandy beach with a slope of 1 2 5 at the seaward side at distances of 39 5 and 59 5 cm from the saltwater chamber two socket slots i e x1 near the sea boundary and x2 close to the inland boundary were installed within the scope of seawater intrusion where physical barriers could be inserted the physical barrier was made of a porous acrylic sheet with a thickness of 1 cm and the impermeable part was sealed with waterproof tape previous experiments suggested that this method of inserting physical barrier had more advantages than the traditional way of rebuilding and refilling for maintaining the same structure and hydrological parameters of porous media before and after the construction of physical barriers fang et al 2021b the freshwater chamber simulated an inland boundary with a fixed head through an overflow weir and the water level in the freshwater chamber was set to 24 5 cm from the tank base this setting was consistent with our previous research fang et al 2021b ensuring that the seawater intrusion distance exceeded the location of physical barriers freshwater was prepared by heating deionized water to 70 and then cooling it naturally thus removing bubbles trapped in the water the salinity and density of freshwater were measured to be 0 and 1000 g l respectively the concentration and density of artificial seawater were 35 and 1025 g l respectively which was prepared by dissolving 34 g of sodium chloride nacl analytical reagent grade and 1 g of red food dye sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd into 1 l of prepared freshwater red food dye was a commonly used dye to trace the movement of seawater and the studies of yu et al 2019 and mo et al 2021 have confirmed the effectiveness of red food dye three experiments were performed in the sand tank firstly seawater intrusion and the sgd processes in coastal aquifers were explored under the condition without subsurface physical barriers which was the base case for the subsequent tests secondly the upper part of the porous acrylic sheet was sealed with tape thus transformed into a cutoff wall the depth of the cutoff wall was preset to 25 2 cm and the location was fixed at x1 in the central chamber to investigate the effect of a cutoff wall on the seawater intrusion process thirdly we sealed the lower part of the porous acrylic sheet with impermeable tape the physical barrier was transformed into a subsurface dam with a height of 13 0 cm at the location of x1 thus exploring the influence of a subsurface dam all experiments continued until the salt freshwater distribution reached a quasi steady state the quasi steady state was determined by comparing the images of salinity distributions at a 2 hour interval the running times of the experimental cases were 12 36 h during the entire experiment a high pixel camera canon ixus 285 hs was used to record the change of salinity distribution in the sand tank through taking pictures every 30 min 2 2 numerical simulations a series of numerical simulations were performed at the laboratory scale with the feflow software diersch 2014 numerical setups were established based on a number of assumptions including that the aquifer was homogeneous and isotropic and the solute density was only related to concentration we chose the richards equation combined with the advection diffusion equation to govern variably saturated and variable density groundwater flow and solute transport processes in these equations the relationships among phase saturations relative permeability and capillary pressures were described by the van genuchten functions van genuchten 1980 the settings of the numerical model were consistent with the laboratory experiments including the dimensions of the domain hydrogeological parameters and boundary conditions the model domain was triangulated into 90 119 elements with the largest edge length of 0 4 mm the mesh discretization satisfied the numerical stability requirement that the peclet number was less than 4 voss and provost 2002 the ab and cd boundaries of the numerical model fig 2b were set to zero flux conditions the freshwater boundary bc was set as a fixed head with a solute concentration of 0 g l the sea boundary aed was defined as a tidal boundary where nodes above the sea level were treated as a seepage face and nodes below were set as a given head boundary that changed with the tidal stage and seawater depth the elements occupied by the subsurface physical barriers were set as inactive units the hydrogeological parameters used in the numerical model are shown in table 1 in this study the coordinate origin was fixed at the intersection of the mean sea level and the aquifer beach based on the experimental data the numerical model was validated and then used to perform the sensitivity analysis of the structure of subsurface physical barriers the first trial examined the influence of the depth of a cutoff wall at location x1 x 19 5 cm a series of wall depths wd was set to 21 6 23 6 25 2 26 6 28 6 29 6 and 30 2 cm and the dimensionless depths wd ratio of wd to aquifer thickness 23 8 cm from the base to the mean sea level were calculated to be 0 907 0 991 1 058 1 117 1 201 1 243 and 1 269 next we investigated the effect of cutoff wall location with a fixed depth of 30 2 cm the wall locations wl and the dimensionless locations wl i e the ratio of wl to aquifer length were x 9 2 19 5 29 7 40 0 and 50 2 cm and 0 069 0 146 0 223 0 299 and 0 376 respectively the effect of the subsurface dam height on the sgd was examined in the third trial there the location of the subsurface dam was again fixed at x1 x 19 5 cm and a series of dam heights dh of 6 4 8 7 11 2 13 0 17 8 and 23 8 cm was simulated with the dimensionless heights dh i e the ratio of dh to aquifer thickness of 0 269 0 368 0 470 0 547 0 750 and 1 000 respectively the last trial explored the role of the subsurface dam location with a fixed height of 10 7 cm the specific locations dl of subsurface dam were preset to x 9 2 19 5 29 7 40 0 and 50 2 cm within the range of seawater intrusion and the dimensionless locations dl i e the ratio of dl to aquifer length were calculated as 0 069 0 146 0 223 0 299 and 0 376 the numerical model continued to run for 2 h after reaching a steady state and its results were used for analyzing the salinity distribution and water exchange across the aquifer sea interface the numerical simulation task was completed via two intel i7 9700 processors and the run time of the machine was approximately 1 9 days for each case 2 3 evaluation indexes the water exchange across the aquifer sea interface was quantified by the period budget module in feflow including the total efflux of sgd termed as qtsgd and its components such as tide induced saltwater circulation qt fresh groundwater discharge qf and density driven saltwater circulation qd we further converted the sgd flux into a dimensionless form that represented the ratio of the sgd flux to the reference flux in this study the reference fluxes were the results of the base case where the physical barrier was absent and the values of qtsgd qt qf and qd in the base case were 1 117 0 530 0 163 and 0 424 m3 d m respectively the sgd flux is closely related to the salinity distribution of coastal aquifers robinson et al 2007a to explain the driving mechanism of the sgd we used some quantitative indexes to quantify the salt freshwater distribution using the 50 isohaline chang et al 2019 2022 the zones of usp and sw could be divided and their areas were denoted as ausp and asw between usp and sw was the tube of fresh groundwater discharge and the width of this tube at the aquifer sea interface was termed as wtfsgd the enclosed region determined by 10 and 90 isohalines is generally defined as the salt freshwater mixing zone lu et al 2013 and its average thickness could be quantified by the following equation chang et al 2022 2 wt ms ml where ms and ml are the area l2 and perimeter l of the salt freshwater mixing zone respectively the average thicknesses of the mixing zones around the sw and usp were denoted as wtsw and wtusp respectively the indexes of the salinity distribution were also calculated as dimensionless values dividing the respective values by the corresponding results of the base case without physical barriers the values of ausp asw wtfsgd wtsw and wtusp in the base case were 5 42 10 3 m2 5 96 10 2 m2 2 40 cm 5 61 cm and 3 70 cm respectively hereinafter the results of the sgd and salinity distribution were analyzed using the dimensionless expression and an assessment index with a value of 1 indicated that this result was equal to the data in the base case the abbreviations and codes commonly used in this study are listed in table 2 3 results 3 1 experimental salinity distribution for the three initial cases without a physical barrier with a cutoff wall and with a subsurface dam the salt freshwater distribution at a steady state in the sand tank is shown in fig 3 a c the salinity distribution and flow field of the validated numerical model are also displayed in fig 3d f for comparison the salt freshwater interfaces determined by the numerical 50 isohalines are added to fig 3a c and indicated by a solid black line the salinity distribution determined by the numerical model was consistent with the results of laboratory experiments no matter with or without a physical barrier this indicates that the numerical model constructed in this study can be used to explore the impact of subsurface physical barriers on groundwater dynamics as suggested in previous studies mo et al 2021 robinson et al 2016 yu et al 2019 due to the lack of high definition photographs that can translate luminance difference into salinity variation the use of food red dye in laboratory experiment generally failed to capture the range of the salt freshwater mixing zone thus in fig 3 the width of the mixing zone captured by the food red dye was narrower than that determined by the numerical model seawater intrusion formed two zones of saline water i e the sw at the bottom and the usp at the top as shown in fig 3 the construction of a physical barrier can effectively reduce the distance and range of seawater intrusion and the invasive distance of the sw was limited to the location of the physical barrier fig 3e further shows that the cutoff wall hindered the seaward migration of inland freshwater in the upper aquifer the tube of fresh groundwater discharge was compressed with a high flow velocity under the wall the groundwater bypassing the wall continued to flow seaward along the edge of the sw and there was an upward component of groundwater velocity which washed against the sw and resulted in a large salt freshwater mixing zone on the seaward side of the wall the rise of the sw and the upward groundwater velocity squeezed the space of the usp which was smaller in size than that in the base case i e no physical barrier for fig 3d in fig 3f the subsurface dam blocked the movement of groundwater in the lower aquifer and the inland freshwater was discharged seaward above the dam crest compared with the scenario without a physical barrier fig 3d the change in the groundwater flow field caused by a subsurface dam fig 3f was smaller than that induced by a cutoff wall fig 3e 3 2 effect of cutoff wall on sgd 3 2 1 cutoff wall depth fig 4 shows the salinity distribution for different depths wd of cutoff walls as the wall depth increased the invasive distance of the sw gradually decreased and the sw on the sea side of the cutoff wall bulged outward and rose moreover the increasing wall depth enhanced the mixing of saltwater and freshwater at the edge of the sw and the width of the mixing zone increased the salt freshwater interfaces determined by the 50 isohalines are compared in fig 4g following an increasing wall depth the usp expanded slightly in the intertidal zone but the usp size was smaller than that in the base case under no wall condition the changes in the sw and usp led to a decline in the widths of fresh groundwater discharge tube at the sea boundary as the wall depth increased the location where fresh groundwater discharged into the sea moved upward along the beach landward in comparison with the base case as mentioned earlier fig 4g records an increased trend of the usp size as the wall depth increases however all the usp areas in the cases with a cutoff wall were smaller than that in the base case these results demonstrated that as the wall depth increased from 0 to 1 269 the usp contracted first in the intertidal zone and then expanded the nonmonotonic relationship between the usp size and wall depth may be related to the direction of groundwater flow at the wall location when the wall depth was small the flow direction of fresh groundwater was directly opposite the usp thus moving away the saltwater within the usp and reducing the usp size when the wall depth was large fresh groundwater flowed vertically upward e g fig 4f and a wider mixing zone occurred in the intertidal zone due to the usp interface determined by the 50 isohaline the increasing width of the mixing zone increased the usp size the results of quantitative salinity distribution under various wall depths including the area of the usp and sw ausp and asw width of freshwater discharge outfall at the sea boundary wtfsgd and average width of the mixing zone around the sw and usp wtsw and wtusp are shown in fig 5 a consistent with the visual observations from fig 4 the usp areas increased with an increase in the wall depth but were less than the value of 1 0 for the base case the sw area decreased first and then increased as the wall depth increased an explanation for this is that the sw toe exceeded the wall location when the wall depth was small and the sw gradually retreated as the wall depth increased thus reducing the sw area when the wall depth was large the sw range was limited to the seaward side of the wall and following the increased depth the rise of the sw increased the sw area in addition the sw areas in all cases with a cutoff wall were close to the value of 1 0 in the base case because the rise of the sw alleviated the reduction in sw size induced by the sw toe retreat as shown in fig 5a an increase in the wall depth reduced the width of the freshwater discharge outfall and increased the average widths of the mixing zones around the sw and usp fig 5b shows the results of the water exchange across the aquifer sea interface following the increased wall depth both the qt and qd fluxes decreased increasing the wall depth resulted in an increase in the width of the mixing zone at the edges of the usp and sw fig 5a and a decrease in their density gradient as robinson et al 2007a suggested a positive correlation was found between the density gradient in the mixing zone and the flux of saltwater circulation thus the increased wall depth reduced the qt and qd fluxes in fig 5b the qf flux decreased with increasing wall depth which was in accord with the change in the width of the freshwater discharge outfall fig 5a the decrease in the fluxes of qt qd and qf led to a decrease in the total efflux qtsgd as the wall depth increased overall an increase in the wall depth reduced the fluxes of water exchange across the aquifer sea interface therefore the presence of cutoff wall led to decreases in tide induced circulation qt of 25 33 density driven circulation qd of 10 30 fresh groundwater discharge qf of 17 60 and the total efflux qtsgd of 18 36 the decrease in fresh groundwater discharge indicated that the hydraulic gradient in upstream aquifer was reduced thus the groundwater level upstream of the wall rose because of a fixed head of the inland boundary if the sw was completely blocked at the seaward side the cutoff wall could be considered effective as shown in fig 4 the wall depth of 1 201 was the minimum effective depth to achieve this goal under this scenario the tide induced flux density induced flux freshwater discharge and total efflux were 67 75 49 and 67 compared to the results of the base case respectively 3 2 2 cutoff wall location the effect of cutoff wall location wl on the salinity distribution of the aquifer is shown in fig 6 as the wall moved inland wl increased the invasive distance of the sw increased while the rise of the sw on the sea side of the wall decreased the usp gradually expanded in the intertidal zone and the usp size was greater than that in the base case as soon as the wall location was greater than 0 223 as shown in fig 6e following the inland movement of cutoff wall the discharge outfall of fresh groundwater at the sea boundary moved seaward downward along the beach slope considering the location of the discharge outfall in the base case as a reference when the wall location was close to the sea boundary e g wl 0 069 the discharge outfall was located further inland compared to the reference and when the wall location was closer inland e g wl 0 299 the discharge outfall was located further seaward fig 7 a presents the quantified results of the salinity distribution under different wall location conditions following the inland movement of the cutoff wall both the areas of the usp ausp and sw asw gradually increased the width of freshwater discharge outfall wtfsgd slightly increased but all the values were much less than that of the base case 1 0 there was a nonmonotonic correlation between the wall location and the average width of the usp mixing zone wtusp and the average width peaked at the wall location of 0 223 when the wall location was less than 0 223 the usp expanded significantly in the intertidal zone as the wall location moved inland and the usp area and the average width of the usp mixing zone increased however the usp expanded slightly in the intertidal zone when the wall location was increased and greater than 0 223 thus the perimeter of the mixing zone increased slightly but the range was almost constant which resulted in a slight decrease in the average width of the usp mixing zone the average width of the sw mixing zone wtsw also increased first and then decreased as the wall moved inland due to the changes in the space of saltwater and freshwater on the sea side of the wall which can be confirmed in fig 6a d under the various wall location conditions the results of the water exchange across the aquifer sea interface are compared in fig 7b as the wall location moved inland the total efflux of the sgd qtsgd and each component qt qd and qf increased when the wall location exceeded 0 223 the qt flux was greater than 1 0 in the base case which caused the usp range i e ausp 1 6 in fig 7a to be larger than that in the base case although the increased wall locations led to an increase in the fluxes of sgd the qtsgd qd and qf fluxes were less than that in the base case especially for qf which was only half of the base case value in fig 7 the changing trend and range of qf and the freshwater outfall width were nearly identical and the similar phenomena also occurred between qt and the usp area and between qd and the sw area these findings illustrated that the sgd was closely related to the distribution of salt freshwater in coastal aquifers in summary as the cutoff wall was positioned far away from the sea boundary its influence on the water exchange across the aquifer sea interface weakened and the sgd fluxes gradually increased especially the tide induced circulation that even exceeded the data in the base case without cutoff wall however the sgd fluxes in the cutoff wall cases were generally smaller than those in the base case the relative reduction of tide induced circulation qt was 0 11 65 a negative value represents an increase with respect to the results in the base case while the density driven circulation qd was reduced by 2 41 fresh groundwater discharge qf decreased by 53 64 and the total efflux qtsgd reduced by 3 56 3 3 effect of subsurface dam on sgd 3 3 1 subsurface dam height the results of the salinity distribution for different heights dh of a subsurface dam at a fixed location are provided in fig 8 the sw intrusion was blocked on the seaward side of the dam and the sw gradually rose as the dam height increased there was a marked decline in the usp range with increasing dam height what can be clearly seen in fig 8e is the continuous landward upward movement of the discharge outfall of fresh groundwater along the beach slope as the dam height increased because of the changes in the sw and usp interfaces fig 9 a summarizes the quantified results of salinity distribution under different dam height conditions as the dam height increased the usp area ausp decreased while the sw area asw gradually increased due to the rise of the sw a nonmonotonic correlation was observed between the width of freshwater discharge outfall wtfsgd and the dam height and the outfall width peaked at the height of dh 0 368 this height is also the minimum effective height of the subsurface dam at the defined location which has been confirmed in our previous work fang et al 2021b the findings of chang et al 2019 indicated that fresh groundwater discharge reaches the maximum flux when the height of subsurface dam is set to the minimum effective height therefore the outfall width peaked at the dam height of 0 368 and was greater than the result in the base case the average widths of the mixing zones around the usp wtusp and sw wtsw decreased with increasing dam height the effect of dam height on the water exchange across the aquifer sea boundary is quantified in fig 9b with greater dam heights the qt qd and qtsgd fluxes reduced and were less than the results in the base case as shown in fig 9a as the dam height increased the usp area decreased which reduced the qt flux within the usp the sw area increased and the width of the mixing zone decreased larger density gradient these factors are theoretically favorable for a high qd flux however in reality the increasing dam height hindered the flow of fresh groundwater near the dam resulting in a low flow velocity of fresh groundwater near the sw mixing zone as a result less salt in the sw mixing zone was carried away by the fresh groundwater flow and less salt needed to be replenished by the saltwater circulation qd thus a decline in the qd flux was recorded in fig 9b additionally consistent with the change in the width of the discharge outfall wtfsgd in fig 9a the qf flux in fig 9b possessed a nonmonotonic relationship with the dam height and peaked at the minimum effective dam height of 0 368 in summary an increase in the height of subsurface dam reduced the water exchange at the sea boundary except for fresh groundwater discharge using the sgd fluxes in the base case as a reference the height variations of the subsurface dam led to decreases of 2 35 3 34 4 19 and 2 32 in the tide induced circulation qt density driven circulation qd fresh groundwater discharge qf and total efflux qtsgd respectively for the effective height range of the subsurface dam i e dh 0 368 fresh groundwater discharge peaked i e 1 04 times the reference flux at the minimum effective height and the tide induced circulation density driven circulation and total efflux reached the maximum values which were 94 93 and 95 of the results in the base case respectively 3 3 2 subsurface dam location the distribution of salt freshwater in the aquifer is shown in fig 10 for various locations of a subsurface dam dl as the dam moved inland increasing dl the usp sizes essentially remained unchanged while the sw intruded landward the height of the sw was raised near the dam and other regions were essentially identical to those of the base case fig 11 a presents the quantified results of the salinity distribution for different dam locations as the dam moved inland increasing dl the usp area ausp decreased and then increased reaching a minimum at the dam location of 0 146 this behavior may be due to the fact that the defined fixed height was the minimum effective height of subsurface dam at the first location of dl 0 069 in this situation the sw height at the dam location was basically the same as the dam height as well as the sw height in the base case that is to say the dam played a minor effect on the flow field at the seaward side and the usp region and thus the usp area was close to that under the no dam condition base case when the dam was moved to the location of dl 0 146 the dam height was greater than the sw height at the dam location and the inland freshwater discharge was compressed by the dam to flow above the dam crest thus the flow velocity of inland freshwater increased reducing the usp area as the dam continued to move inland and the distance from the usp increased the local changes in groundwater flow field caused by subsurface dam had less impact on the usp and the usp area gradually increased these factors ultimately resulted in a nonmonotonic correlation between the usp area and the dam location following the landward movement of the dam the sw area asw increased and the width of the discharge outfall wtfsgd decreased slightly the variations of the average widths of the mixing zones around the sw wtsw and usp wtusp were similar to the trends of the sw and usp areas respectively as the dam moved inland the water exchange across the aquifer sea interface is shown in fig 11b as the dam moved landward the qt flux within the usp decreased first and then increased which was consistent with the change in the usp area the qd flux within the sw increased due to the increase in sw size while the qf flux gradually decreased because of the reduction in the width of the discharge outfall the total efflux qtsgd from the sea boundary increased with the landward movement of the dam when the dam was close to the sea boundary e g dl 0 069 the fluxes of water exchange at the aquifer sea interface differed significantly from the results in the base case especially the qd flux as the dam approached the inland boundary e g dl 0 376 the sgd fluxes were close to the values in the base case i e 1 0 this indicates that the influence of local flow field changes caused by the subsurface dam on sgd decreased as the dam moved away from the sea boundary these results highlight the important role of the dam location for sgd overall compared with the results of the base case the sgd fluxes for the various dam locations were generally smaller the tide induced circulation qt density driven circulation qd fresh groundwater discharge qf and total efflux qtsgd were reduced by 0 6 0 19 6 3 and 0 8 respectively these results indicated that the effect of subsurface dam location on the reduction in sgd fluxes was not obvious which may be due to the height of subsurface dam in these cases the fixed dam height was the minimum effective height at the first location of dl 0 069 4 discussion although previous studies have revealed the characteristics of water exchange across the aquifer sea interface the presence of subsurface physical barriers and their impact on sgd have been neglected evans and wilson 2017 in this study we systematically explored the effect of the construction of subsurface physical barriers in coastal aquifers on sgd involving physical barriers including commonly used subsurface dams and cutoff walls in general the presence of physical barriers hindered the hydraulic connection between the upstream and downstream groundwater flow and the sgd fluxes were reduced compared with those without a barrier yet an abnormal trend occurred in the fresh groundwater discharge with a present subsurface dam when the dam height was close to the minimum effective height fresh groundwater discharge was greater than that before the construction of subsurface dam similar phenomenon was also observed in previous studies fang et al 2021b and chang et al 2019 found that fresh groundwater discharge peaked at the minimum effective dam height however the response of saline sgd to subsurface physical barriers was firstly confirmed in our study sgd is a hidden and important mechanism to transport dissolved chemicals from groundwater into the ocean and it plays an important role in coastal water quality and ecosystem rodellas et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 the present study found that the construction of subsurface physical barriers generally reduced the fresh and saline sgd fluxes relative to the results when no barrier was present for cutoff walls fresh sgd was decreased by a percentage of 17 64 and the reduction in saline sgd was 4 53 a negative value represents an increase fresh and saline sgds were reduced by 6 20 and 0 35 respectively under subsurface dam conditions fresh sgd is driven by the inland hydraulic gradient carrying chemical loads from land from the marine perspective the freshwater nutrients carbon and heavy metals delivered by fresh sgd can be regarded as new inputs santos et al 2021 for eutrophic or polluted coastal waters the presence of subsurface physical barriers and hence a reduced fresh sgd with its associated nutrients and pollutants might pose a favorable signal for the protection of coastal water quality for oligotrophic seas such as the mediterranean sea rodellas et al 2015 fresh sgd is a key source of nutrients to maintain marine productivity and the decline in fresh sgd caused by physical barriers is not conducive to the stability of coastal ecosystem saline sgd is usually larger than fresh sgd at most monitored sites and also roughly exceeds the input of river discharge at the global scale kwon et al 2014 luijendijk et al 2020 previous studies have suggested that saline sgd and its delivering nutrients are crucial for sustaining primary productivity and water quality beck et al 2017 for example the slow and continuous release of nutrients into surface water via saline sgd can alleviate seasonal changes in seawater nutrient content andrisoa et al 2019 the nutrients with a high concentration in coastal waters can also be degraded during the saline sgd circulation erler et al 2014 the presence of subsurface physical barriers leads to a decrease in the flux of saline sgd which is bound to affect its role in the water cycle material cycle and ecosystem therefore when studying the water exchange and material cycle across the aquifer sea interface the influence of subsurface physical barriers cannot be ignored in addition to the changes in the sgd fluxes the presence of subsurface physical barriers also affects the distribution of salt freshwater in coastal aquifers and the tube of fresh groundwater discharge thereby changing the location of the sgd outflow while this work only investigated homogeneous isotropic aquifers this is still true for real world aquifers with heterogeneous anisotropic conditions where the discharge locations are likewise influenced by the same observed effects at the aquifer sea interface subsurface physical barriers with different structures cause various changes in the location of freshwater discharge outfall for example when a cutoff wall with the same depth is located farther inland the discharge outfall moves seaward downward along the beach taking the location of the discharge outfall under the no barrier condition as a reference when the cutoff wall is located near to the sea boundary the discharge outfall lies above the reference and when the wall location is closer inland the discharge outfall is placed below the reference zheng et al 2022 and sun et al 2021 also investigated the effect of cutoff wall on the distribution of salt freshwater but they simplified the sea boundary ignoring tides and beach slopes and thus the above dynamic changes in intertidal groundwater were not observed in their studies the documented response of marine biota to sgd is quite variable and site specific and the sites subjected to fresh sgd provide favorable condition to enhance the growth rates of mussels and oysters andrisoa et al 2019 spalt et al 2020 similarly pisternick et al 2020 and starke et al 2020 revealed a positive association between increased growth rate and abundance of fish and fresh sgd sites variation in the location of sgd outflow induced by physical barriers can conceivably result in changes of the habitat locations of relevant marine organisms the construction of subsurface physical barriers alters the width of the salt freshwater mixing zone that represents the magnitude of the mixing effect the difference in the chemical composition of terrestrial freshwater and seawater generates a strong geochemical gradient in the mixing zone robinson et al 2018 thus the mixing zone is a key chemical reaction site in coastal aquifers determining the fate and flux of terrestrial and marine derived chemicals discharged into the sea heiss et al 2017 have found that terrestrial nitrates experience a strong denitrification process in the usp mixing zone with degradation rates of up to 100 for those under usual groundwater conditions in the present study fig 5 shows that as the depth of cutoff wall increased the widths of the mixing zones at the edge of the usp and sw increased and the flux of fresh groundwater discharge decreased these findings are consistent with those of chang et al 2022 who explored this topic under a simplified sea boundary no tides these changes led to an increase in the chemical reaction sites and a decline in the chemical load delivered by the fresh sgd which is conducive to improving the degradation efficiency of land derived chemicals prior to discharge the construction of subsurface physical barriers in coastal areas is designed to control seawater intrusion and protect fresh groundwater in upstream aquifers armanuos et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 zheng et al 2022 this study revealed that the presence of physical barriers generally reduced the sgd fluxes thereby conceivably altering the original coastal water environment and ecosystem therefore we suggest that the structural design of subsurface physical barriers should increase the sgd fluxes as much as possible under the premise of preventing seawater intrusion so as to alleviate the disturbance induced by physical barriers if physical barriers are close to the sea boundary the regions of fresh groundwater that are protected by the barriers increase but their influence on sgd also increases and the sgd fluxes decrease significantly conversely if the barriers are located farther inland their effect on the sgd is less pronounced but the intended effect of the physical barrier to protect freshwater areas is also reduced that is the location of subsurface physical barriers should be chosen to make a compromise between the protection of fresh groundwater and the reduced disturbance on sgd when the barrier location is fixed fig 9b shows that there is an effective height range for subsurface dams and in this range the fresh and saline sgds peak at the minimum effective height when the dam height is close to the minimum effective height e g 0 269 dh 0 470 the effects of subsurface dams on sgd fluxes are negligible similarly fig 5b demonstrates that fresh and saline sgds reach the maximum fluxes at the minimum effective depth of a cutoff wall for the effective depth range these findings provide basic guidance for the design of subsurface dam height and cutoff wall depth considering their comprehensive implications for seawater intrusion and sgd 5 conclusions this study used both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations to investigate the effect of subsurface physical barriers on the water exchange across the aquifer sea interface different types of physical barriers including cutoff walls and subsurface dams were examined the key findings are summarized as follows the construction of subsurface physical barriers altered the salinity distribution salt freshwater mixing and tube of fresh groundwater discharge in coastal aquifers at the aquifer sea interface subsurface physical barriers with different sizes and distances resulted in various changes in the location of freshwater discharge outfall for example as a cutoff wall moved inland the discharge outfall shifted seaward downward along the beach the water exchange across the aquifer sea interface was closely related to the structure of subsurface physical barriers with an increased height of a subsurface dam or the increase in the depth of a cutoff wall the fresh and saline sgd fluxes revealed a decreasing trend as the barrier moved inland the sgd fluxes increased while simultaneously the protection effect of the physical barrier weakened an abnormal change occurred in fresh groundwater discharge that decreased as the subsurface dam moved landward the presence of physical barriers hindered the hydraulic connection between the upstream and downstream groundwater flow and the sgd fluxes were reduced compared with those where no barrier was present for cutoff walls the change in the wall depth led to decreases in tide induced saltwater circulation of 25 33 density driven saltwater circulation of 10 30 fresh groundwater discharge of 17 60 and the total efflux of 18 36 for subsurface dams a series of dam heights resulted in decreases of 2 35 3 34 4 19 a negative value represents an increase and 2 32 in the tide induced saltwater circulation density driven saltwater circulation fresh groundwater discharge and total efflux respectively for an effective height range of the subsurface dam fresh and saline sgd fluxes peaked at the minimum effective height and fresh groundwater discharge tide induced circulation density driven circulation and total efflux were 104 94 93 and 95 of the results under the no barrier condition respectively notwithstanding the above findings real world aquifers usually experience a higher complexity than considered here regarding aquifer properties such as heterogeneity anisotropy inland water table variations multi component tidal signals and waves these complexities of coastal aquifers are known to affect the seawater intrusion and sgd processes future studies are required to investigate the joint effects of aquifer complexities and subsurface physical barriers on the water exchange across the aquifer sea interface nevertheless this study firstly provides a systematic assessment of the sgd fluxes in coastal aquifers where subsurface physical barriers have been constructed for seawater intrusion control the critical findings have been well clarified via the associated salinity distribution therefore the findings can provide a general framework that can be used to guide the prediction and monitoring of sgd behaviors in coastal aquifers where subsurface physical barriers are intended or have been constructed credit

zheng school of resources and environmental engineering hefei university of technology hefei 230009 china submarine groundwater discharge sgd is an important component of the local and regional hydrologic cycles affecting coastal water quality and ecology however the influence of subsurface physical barriers widely built in coastal aquifers for seawater intrusion control has not yet been fully understood with respect to the downstream sgd in this study we used both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations to quantify the contribution of subsurface physical barriers to the fresh and saline sgd fluxes different types of physical barriers including cutoff wall and subsurface dam were examined with various structures e g barrier location height or penetration depth the results demonstrated that subsurface physical barriers with different structures resulted in various changes in the location of the freshwater discharge at the aquifer sea interface e g the discharge location shifted seaward as the cutoff wall moved inland the water exchange across the aquifer sea interface was closely related to the structure of subsurface physical barriers with the increase in the height of subsurface dam or the increase in the depth of cutoff wall the fresh and saline sgd fluxes revealed a decreasing trend generally the presence of a physical barrier hindered the hydraulic connection between the upstream and downstream aquifers and the sgd fluxes were reduced compared to those without any barrier for cutoff walls the change in wall depths led to decreases in tide induced saltwater circulation of 25 33 density driven saltwater circulation of 10 30 fresh groundwater discharge of 17 60 and the total efflux of 18 36 within the effective height range of the subsurface dam fresh and saline sgd fluxes peaked at the minimum effective height these findings provide a general framework for the prediction and monitoring of sgd behavior in coastal aquifers where subsurface physical barriers are intended or have been constructed keywords submarine groundwater discharge saltwater intrusion subsurface physical barriers tide unconfined aquifer data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater in coastal aquifers is discharged into the ocean through the seabed of continental margins generally termed as submarine groundwater discharge sgd rodellas et al 2015 as an important component of the local regional and global hydrologic cycles it is important for different aspects and subject to an interdisciplinary field of research moosdorf et al 2021 for example sgd carries large quantities of land derived chemicals into the sea while participating in groundwater flow across the land sea interface zhang et al 2020 in addition to the standard pathways e g atmospheric deposition and rivers sgd has been identified as a critical and underestimated source of freshwater nutrients heavy metals carbon trace elements and organic pollutants for coastal waters with its contribution probably higher than river inputs robinson et al 2018 santos et al 2021 global scale estimations of sgd propose that sgd derived dissolved inorganic nitrogen and dissolved inorganic phosphorus fluxes are 1 4 and 1 6 times the riverine inputs to the global ocean respectively cho et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 therefore sgd has significant implications for the water quality ecosystems and primary productivity in the coastal ocean sawyer et al 2016 the sgd comprises terrestrial freshwater and recirculated seawater and can be divided into three components according to the driving forces fig 1 a i e tide or wave induced saltwater circulation fresh groundwater discharge and density driven saltwater circulation kuan et al 2019 fluctuations in sea level caused by tides or waves form an upper saline plume usp at the intertidal zone in the upper aquifer and a saltwater circulation occurs within the usp and is defined as tide induced saltwater circulation fang et al 2022 seawater intrudes inland along the aquifer base seawater intrusion which is caused by the density difference between freshwater and seawater lu and werner 2013 lu et al 2019 seawater intrusion generates a saltwater wedge sw and saltwater circulation termed as density driven saltwater circulation in the lower aquifer zheng et al 2021 terrestrial fresh groundwater flows into the ocean through a freshwater tube between the sw and usp sgd components impact one another and there are correlations among the sgd components theoretical research of robinson et al 2007a suggested that tide induced circulation decreased and density driven circulation increased with the increase of fresh groundwater discharge the salinity distribution in coastal aquifers also affects the fluxes of sgd components robinson et al 2007b found that the size of the sw and thickness of the salt freshwater mixing zone around the sw influenced the flux of density driven circulation the above sgd characteristics and salinity distribution have been well confirmed by previous field monitoring studies numerical simulations and laboratory experiments fang et al 2021a heiss and michael 2014 santos et al 2021 yan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 in the last few decades to protect fresh groundwater resource subsurface physical barriers have been constructed in coastal areas to prevent the intrusion of seawater fig 1b for example as early as 1988 the u s army corps of engineers built subsurface physical barriers in new orleans aimed to block seawater intrusion from the gulf of mexico mcanally and pritchard 1997 japan has constructed at least seven physical barriers in coastal aquifers to limit the inland intrusion of seawater luyun et al 2009 similar engineering practices also occur in other coastal countries such as china india the middle east and some african countries armanuos et al 2019 2020 a growing number of engineering applications have shown that building physical barriers is a technically feasible and effective solution to control seawater intrusion chang et al 2022 zheng et al 2022 the construction of subsurface physical barriers hinders the hydraulic connection between upstream and downstream aquifers and further affects the shape and size of the usp sw and freshwater discharge channel thus eventually determining the fluxes of sgd and its components fang et al 2021a although increasing applications of subsurface physical barriers are occurring in coastal areas there is still very little scientific understanding of how physical barriers affect the water exchange across the aquifer sea interface the existing body of research on subsurface physical barriers pays more attention to the effectiveness of fresh groundwater protection upstream of the barrier and ignores the downstream groundwater behaviors chang et al 2022 kang et al 2021 ke et al 2021 sun et al 2021 zheng et al 2022 therefore the sea boundary is usually simplified in these studies the beach is perpendicular to the aquifer base and sea level is set to static conditions ignoring ocean forces such as tides regarding sgd tide induced saltwater circulation does not exist owing to these simplifications only the flux of fresh groundwater discharge is concerned as it is related to the self purification capacity of the aquifer upstream of a physical barrier fang et al 2021b the surveys such as that conducted by kang et al 2021 have shown that a decline in fresh groundwater discharge was observed after the construction of subsurface physical barriers thus decreasing the load of nitrate from the upstream aquifer discharged into the ocean studies of zheng et al 2021 2022 show the importance of fresh groundwater discharge for purifying residual saltwater trapped in the upstream aquifer while subsurface physical barrier related research focuses on aspects in the upstream area of the barrier the traditional research on sgd tends to study the zone around the aquifer sea interface and neglects the implication of subsurface physical barriers built in the aquifer santos et al 2021 therefore there is a knowledge gap in the intersecting fields of subsurface physical barriers and sgd and that is a systematic understanding of how subsurface physical barriers contribute to sgd and its components is still lacking in this study laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were combined to investigate the effect of subsurface physical barriers on downstream salinity distribution and sgd fluxes different types of physical barriers including cutoff wall and subsurface dam and parameters involving barrier location height or penetration depth were examined laboratory experiments were carried out in a controlled sand tank which allowed for precise observation of the seawater intrusion process and the validation of the numerical model based on laboratory data the numerical model was used to conduct a sensitivity analysis of the structure of physical barrier and clarify its relationship to sgd fluxes the results of these experiments and simulations provide a decisive foundation for the prediction and monitoring of sgd behaviors in coastal aquifers where subsurface physical barriers are intended to be or have been constructed 2 material and methods 2 1 laboratory experiments to observe groundwater behavior in coastal aquifers a sand tank was used for laboratory experiments fig 2 a this device has previously been tested and successfully used to explore the processes of seawater intrusion under the combined effect of tides and a subsurface dam fang et al 2021b the sand tank simulated a vertical two dimensional profile of the coastal aquifer with specific dimensions of 172 9 cm length 45 cm height 8 cm width from left to right two porous partitions divided the sand tank into three parts saltwater chamber central chamber and freshwater chamber the saltwater chamber was connected to a tidal device of variable height overflow vho via multiple rubber hoses at the bottom and the fluctuations of the water level in the vho synchronously drove the change in water level in the saltwater chamber in this study a power system consisting of an electric motor an iron turntable and a steering gear was used to drive the vho device to fluctuate periodically up and down thereby causing a sinusoidal fluctuation of the water level in the saltwater chamber over time following equation 1 1 h t h msl a sin 2 π t t where h t l is the sea level at time t t hmsl l is the mean sea level and a l and t t are the tidal amplitude and period respectively based on the field data of zhang et al 2021 the mean sea level was set to 23 8 cm height from the tank base and the tidal amplitude and period were preset to 2 cm and 1 min respectively fresh groundwater discharge from the central chamber would dilute the saltwater concentration in the saltwater chamber to address this problem we constantly added seawater of an adequate concentration to the saltwater chamber to maintain a uniform salinity of 35 g l the addition of the required seawater was determined by monitoring the salinity in the saltwater chamber during the experiment a portable meter hq40d portable ec meter hach inc was used every 5 min to measure the electrical conductivity of the seawater the central chamber was filled with white quartz sand representing an unconfined aquifer the quartz sand had a uniform particle size d 50 0 5 mm and d 90 d 10 2 6 after sieving and the porosity was 0 4 using one dimensional column experiments fang et al 2021b the average hydraulic conductivity and longitudinal dispersivity were measured to be 2 8 10 3 m s and 0 001 m respectively soil saturation and pressure were also measured by installing moisture sensors and tensiometers to fit the van genuchten curve van genuchten 1980 constants a and n in the van genuchten functions were 14 5 m 1 and 2 68 respectively and the residual water saturation was determined as 0 025 the artificial aquifer possessed a sandy beach with a slope of 1 2 5 at the seaward side at distances of 39 5 and 59 5 cm from the saltwater chamber two socket slots i e x1 near the sea boundary and x2 close to the inland boundary were installed within the scope of seawater intrusion where physical barriers could be inserted the physical barrier was made of a porous acrylic sheet with a thickness of 1 cm and the impermeable part was sealed with waterproof tape previous experiments suggested that this method of inserting physical barrier had more advantages than the traditional way of rebuilding and refilling for maintaining the same structure and hydrological parameters of porous media before and after the construction of physical barriers fang et al 2021b the freshwater chamber simulated an inland boundary with a fixed head through an overflow weir and the water level in the freshwater chamber was set to 24 5 cm from the tank base this setting was consistent with our previous research fang et al 2021b ensuring that the seawater intrusion distance exceeded the location of physical barriers freshwater was prepared by heating deionized water to 70 and then cooling it naturally thus removing bubbles trapped in the water the salinity and density of freshwater were measured to be 0 and 1000 g l respectively the concentration and density of artificial seawater were 35 and 1025 g l respectively which was prepared by dissolving 34 g of sodium chloride nacl analytical reagent grade and 1 g of red food dye sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd into 1 l of prepared freshwater red food dye was a commonly used dye to trace the movement of seawater and the studies of yu et al 2019 and mo et al 2021 have confirmed the effectiveness of red food dye three experiments were performed in the sand tank firstly seawater intrusion and the sgd processes in coastal aquifers were explored under the condition without subsurface physical barriers which was the base case for the subsequent tests secondly the upper part of the porous acrylic sheet was sealed with tape thus transformed into a cutoff wall the depth of the cutoff wall was preset to 25 2 cm and the location was fixed at x1 in the central chamber to investigate the effect of a cutoff wall on the seawater intrusion process thirdly we sealed the lower part of the porous acrylic sheet with impermeable tape the physical barrier was transformed into a subsurface dam with a height of 13 0 cm at the location of x1 thus exploring the influence of a subsurface dam all experiments continued until the salt freshwater distribution reached a quasi steady state the quasi steady state was determined by comparing the images of salinity distributions at a 2 hour interval the running times of the experimental cases were 12 36 h during the entire experiment a high pixel camera canon ixus 285 hs was used to record the change of salinity distribution in the sand tank through taking pictures every 30 min 2 2 numerical simulations a series of numerical simulations were performed at the laboratory scale with the feflow software diersch 2014 numerical setups were established based on a number of assumptions including that the aquifer was homogeneous and isotropic and the solute density was only related to concentration we chose the richards equation combined with the advection diffusion equation to govern variably saturated and variable density groundwater flow and solute transport processes in these equations the relationships among phase saturations relative permeability and capillary pressures were described by the van genuchten functions van genuchten 1980 the settings of the numerical model were consistent with the laboratory experiments including the dimensions of the domain hydrogeological parameters and boundary conditions the model domain was triangulated into 90 119 elements with the largest edge length of 0 4 mm the mesh discretization satisfied the numerical stability requirement that the peclet number was less than 4 voss and provost 2002 the ab and cd boundaries of the numerical model fig 2b were set to zero flux conditions the freshwater boundary bc was set as a fixed head with a solute concentration of 0 g l the sea boundary aed was defined as a tidal boundary where nodes above the sea level were treated as a seepage face and nodes below were set as a given head boundary that changed with the tidal stage and seawater depth the elements occupied by the subsurface physical barriers were set as inactive units the hydrogeological parameters used in the numerical model are shown in table 1 in this study the coordinate origin was fixed at the intersection of the mean sea level and the aquifer beach based on the experimental data the numerical model was validated and then used to perform the sensitivity analysis of the structure of subsurface physical barriers the first trial examined the influence of the depth of a cutoff wall at location x1 x 19 5 cm a series of wall depths wd was set to 21 6 23 6 25 2 26 6 28 6 29 6 and 30 2 cm and the dimensionless depths wd ratio of wd to aquifer thickness 23 8 cm from the base to the mean sea level were calculated to be 0 907 0 991 1 058 1 117 1 201 1 243 and 1 269 next we investigated the effect of cutoff wall location with a fixed depth of 30 2 cm the wall locations wl and the dimensionless locations wl i e the ratio of wl to aquifer length were x 9 2 19 5 29 7 40 0 and 50 2 cm and 0 069 0 146 0 223 0 299 and 0 376 respectively the effect of the subsurface dam height on the sgd was examined in the third trial there the location of the subsurface dam was again fixed at x1 x 19 5 cm and a series of dam heights dh of 6 4 8 7 11 2 13 0 17 8 and 23 8 cm was simulated with the dimensionless heights dh i e the ratio of dh to aquifer thickness of 0 269 0 368 0 470 0 547 0 750 and 1 000 respectively the last trial explored the role of the subsurface dam location with a fixed height of 10 7 cm the specific locations dl of subsurface dam were preset to x 9 2 19 5 29 7 40 0 and 50 2 cm within the range of seawater intrusion and the dimensionless locations dl i e the ratio of dl to aquifer length were calculated as 0 069 0 146 0 223 0 299 and 0 376 the numerical model continued to run for 2 h after reaching a steady state and its results were used for analyzing the salinity distribution and water exchange across the aquifer sea interface the numerical simulation task was completed via two intel i7 9700 processors and the run time of the machine was approximately 1 9 days for each case 2 3 evaluation indexes the water exchange across the aquifer sea interface was quantified by the period budget module in feflow including the total efflux of sgd termed as qtsgd and its components such as tide induced saltwater circulation qt fresh groundwater discharge qf and density driven saltwater circulation qd we further converted the sgd flux into a dimensionless form that represented the ratio of the sgd flux to the reference flux in this study the reference fluxes were the results of the base case where the physical barrier was absent and the values of qtsgd qt qf and qd in the base case were 1 117 0 530 0 163 and 0 424 m3 d m respectively the sgd flux is closely related to the salinity distribution of coastal aquifers robinson et al 2007a to explain the driving mechanism of the sgd we used some quantitative indexes to quantify the salt freshwater distribution using the 50 isohaline chang et al 2019 2022 the zones of usp and sw could be divided and their areas were denoted as ausp and asw between usp and sw was the tube of fresh groundwater discharge and the width of this tube at the aquifer sea interface was termed as wtfsgd the enclosed region determined by 10 and 90 isohalines is generally defined as the salt freshwater mixing zone lu et al 2013 and its average thickness could be quantified by the following equation chang et al 2022 2 wt ms ml where ms and ml are the area l2 and perimeter l of the salt freshwater mixing zone respectively the average thicknesses of the mixing zones around the sw and usp were denoted as wtsw and wtusp respectively the indexes of the salinity distribution were also calculated as dimensionless values dividing the respective values by the corresponding results of the base case without physical barriers the values of ausp asw wtfsgd wtsw and wtusp in the base case were 5 42 10 3 m2 5 96 10 2 m2 2 40 cm 5 61 cm and 3 70 cm respectively hereinafter the results of the sgd and salinity distribution were analyzed using the dimensionless expression and an assessment index with a value of 1 indicated that this result was equal to the data in the base case the abbreviations and codes commonly used in this study are listed in table 2 3 results 3 1 experimental salinity distribution for the three initial cases without a physical barrier with a cutoff wall and with a subsurface dam the salt freshwater distribution at a steady state in the sand tank is shown in fig 3 a c the salinity distribution and flow field of the validated numerical model are also displayed in fig 3d f for comparison the salt freshwater interfaces determined by the numerical 50 isohalines are added to fig 3a c and indicated by a solid black line the salinity distribution determined by the numerical model was consistent with the results of laboratory experiments no matter with or without a physical barrier this indicates that the numerical model constructed in this study can be used to explore the impact of subsurface physical barriers on groundwater dynamics as suggested in previous studies mo et al 2021 robinson et al 2016 yu et al 2019 due to the lack of high definition photographs that can translate luminance difference into salinity variation the use of food red dye in laboratory experiment generally failed to capture the range of the salt freshwater mixing zone thus in fig 3 the width of the mixing zone captured by the food red dye was narrower than that determined by the numerical model seawater intrusion formed two zones of saline water i e the sw at the bottom and the usp at the top as shown in fig 3 the construction of a physical barrier can effectively reduce the distance and range of seawater intrusion and the invasive distance of the sw was limited to the location of the physical barrier fig 3e further shows that the cutoff wall hindered the seaward migration of inland freshwater in the upper aquifer the tube of fresh groundwater discharge was compressed with a high flow velocity under the wall the groundwater bypassing the wall continued to flow seaward along the edge of the sw and there was an upward component of groundwater velocity which washed against the sw and resulted in a large salt freshwater mixing zone on the seaward side of the wall the rise of the sw and the upward groundwater velocity squeezed the space of the usp which was smaller in size than that in the base case i e no physical barrier for fig 3d in fig 3f the subsurface dam blocked the movement of groundwater in the lower aquifer and the inland freshwater was discharged seaward above the dam crest compared with the scenario without a physical barrier fig 3d the change in the groundwater flow field caused by a subsurface dam fig 3f was smaller than that induced by a cutoff wall fig 3e 3 2 effect of cutoff wall on sgd 3 2 1 cutoff wall depth fig 4 shows the salinity distribution for different depths wd of cutoff walls as the wall depth increased the invasive distance of the sw gradually decreased and the sw on the sea side of the cutoff wall bulged outward and rose moreover the increasing wall depth enhanced the mixing of saltwater and freshwater at the edge of the sw and the width of the mixing zone increased the salt freshwater interfaces determined by the 50 isohalines are compared in fig 4g following an increasing wall depth the usp expanded slightly in the intertidal zone but the usp size was smaller than that in the base case under no wall condition the changes in the sw and usp led to a decline in the widths of fresh groundwater discharge tube at the sea boundary as the wall depth increased the location where fresh groundwater discharged into the sea moved upward along the beach landward in comparison with the base case as mentioned earlier fig 4g records an increased trend of the usp size as the wall depth increases however all the usp areas in the cases with a cutoff wall were smaller than that in the base case these results demonstrated that as the wall depth increased from 0 to 1 269 the usp contracted first in the intertidal zone and then expanded the nonmonotonic relationship between the usp size and wall depth may be related to the direction of groundwater flow at the wall location when the wall depth was small the flow direction of fresh groundwater was directly opposite the usp thus moving away the saltwater within the usp and reducing the usp size when the wall depth was large fresh groundwater flowed vertically upward e g fig 4f and a wider mixing zone occurred in the intertidal zone due to the usp interface determined by the 50 isohaline the increasing width of the mixing zone increased the usp size the results of quantitative salinity distribution under various wall depths including the area of the usp and sw ausp and asw width of freshwater discharge outfall at the sea boundary wtfsgd and average width of the mixing zone around the sw and usp wtsw and wtusp are shown in fig 5 a consistent with the visual observations from fig 4 the usp areas increased with an increase in the wall depth but were less than the value of 1 0 for the base case the sw area decreased first and then increased as the wall depth increased an explanation for this is that the sw toe exceeded the wall location when the wall depth was small and the sw gradually retreated as the wall depth increased thus reducing the sw area when the wall depth was large the sw range was limited to the seaward side of the wall and following the increased depth the rise of the sw increased the sw area in addition the sw areas in all cases with a cutoff wall were close to the value of 1 0 in the base case because the rise of the sw alleviated the reduction in sw size induced by the sw toe retreat as shown in fig 5a an increase in the wall depth reduced the width of the freshwater discharge outfall and increased the average widths of the mixing zones around the sw and usp fig 5b shows the results of the water exchange across the aquifer sea interface following the increased wall depth both the qt and qd fluxes decreased increasing the wall depth resulted in an increase in the width of the mixing zone at the edges of the usp and sw fig 5a and a decrease in their density gradient as robinson et al 2007a suggested a positive correlation was found between the density gradient in the mixing zone and the flux of saltwater circulation thus the increased wall depth reduced the qt and qd fluxes in fig 5b the qf flux decreased with increasing wall depth which was in accord with the change in the width of the freshwater discharge outfall fig 5a the decrease in the fluxes of qt qd and qf led to a decrease in the total efflux qtsgd as the wall depth increased overall an increase in the wall depth reduced the fluxes of water exchange across the aquifer sea interface therefore the presence of cutoff wall led to decreases in tide induced circulation qt of 25 33 density driven circulation qd of 10 30 fresh groundwater discharge qf of 17 60 and the total efflux qtsgd of 18 36 the decrease in fresh groundwater discharge indicated that the hydraulic gradient in upstream aquifer was reduced thus the groundwater level upstream of the wall rose because of a fixed head of the inland boundary if the sw was completely blocked at the seaward side the cutoff wall could be considered effective as shown in fig 4 the wall depth of 1 201 was the minimum effective depth to achieve this goal under this scenario the tide induced flux density induced flux freshwater discharge and total efflux were 67 75 49 and 67 compared to the results of the base case respectively 3 2 2 cutoff wall location the effect of cutoff wall location wl on the salinity distribution of the aquifer is shown in fig 6 as the wall moved inland wl increased the invasive distance of the sw increased while the rise of the sw on the sea side of the wall decreased the usp gradually expanded in the intertidal zone and the usp size was greater than that in the base case as soon as the wall location was greater than 0 223 as shown in fig 6e following the inland movement of cutoff wall the discharge outfall of fresh groundwater at the sea boundary moved seaward downward along the beach slope considering the location of the discharge outfall in the base case as a reference when the wall location was close to the sea boundary e g wl 0 069 the discharge outfall was located further inland compared to the reference and when the wall location was closer inland e g wl 0 299 the discharge outfall was located further seaward fig 7 a presents the quantified results of the salinity distribution under different wall location conditions following the inland movement of the cutoff wall both the areas of the usp ausp and sw asw gradually increased the width of freshwater discharge outfall wtfsgd slightly increased but all the values were much less than that of the base case 1 0 there was a nonmonotonic correlation between the wall location and the average width of the usp mixing zone wtusp and the average width peaked at the wall location of 0 223 when the wall location was less than 0 223 the usp expanded significantly in the intertidal zone as the wall location moved inland and the usp area and the average width of the usp mixing zone increased however the usp expanded slightly in the intertidal zone when the wall location was increased and greater than 0 223 thus the perimeter of the mixing zone increased slightly but the range was almost constant which resulted in a slight decrease in the average width of the usp mixing zone the average width of the sw mixing zone wtsw also increased first and then decreased as the wall moved inland due to the changes in the space of saltwater and freshwater on the sea side of the wall which can be confirmed in fig 6a d under the various wall location conditions the results of the water exchange across the aquifer sea interface are compared in fig 7b as the wall location moved inland the total efflux of the sgd qtsgd and each component qt qd and qf increased when the wall location exceeded 0 223 the qt flux was greater than 1 0 in the base case which caused the usp range i e ausp 1 6 in fig 7a to be larger than that in the base case although the increased wall locations led to an increase in the fluxes of sgd the qtsgd qd and qf fluxes were less than that in the base case especially for qf which was only half of the base case value in fig 7 the changing trend and range of qf and the freshwater outfall width were nearly identical and the similar phenomena also occurred between qt and the usp area and between qd and the sw area these findings illustrated that the sgd was closely related to the distribution of salt freshwater in coastal aquifers in summary as the cutoff wall was positioned far away from the sea boundary its influence on the water exchange across the aquifer sea interface weakened and the sgd fluxes gradually increased especially the tide induced circulation that even exceeded the data in the base case without cutoff wall however the sgd fluxes in the cutoff wall cases were generally smaller than those in the base case the relative reduction of tide induced circulation qt was 0 11 65 a negative value represents an increase with respect to the results in the base case while the density driven circulation qd was reduced by 2 41 fresh groundwater discharge qf decreased by 53 64 and the total efflux qtsgd reduced by 3 56 3 3 effect of subsurface dam on sgd 3 3 1 subsurface dam height the results of the salinity distribution for different heights dh of a subsurface dam at a fixed location are provided in fig 8 the sw intrusion was blocked on the seaward side of the dam and the sw gradually rose as the dam height increased there was a marked decline in the usp range with increasing dam height what can be clearly seen in fig 8e is the continuous landward upward movement of the discharge outfall of fresh groundwater along the beach slope as the dam height increased because of the changes in the sw and usp interfaces fig 9 a summarizes the quantified results of salinity distribution under different dam height conditions as the dam height increased the usp area ausp decreased while the sw area asw gradually increased due to the rise of the sw a nonmonotonic correlation was observed between the width of freshwater discharge outfall wtfsgd and the dam height and the outfall width peaked at the height of dh 0 368 this height is also the minimum effective height of the subsurface dam at the defined location which has been confirmed in our previous work fang et al 2021b the findings of chang et al 2019 indicated that fresh groundwater discharge reaches the maximum flux when the height of subsurface dam is set to the minimum effective height therefore the outfall width peaked at the dam height of 0 368 and was greater than the result in the base case the average widths of the mixing zones around the usp wtusp and sw wtsw decreased with increasing dam height the effect of dam height on the water exchange across the aquifer sea boundary is quantified in fig 9b with greater dam heights the qt qd and qtsgd fluxes reduced and were less than the results in the base case as shown in fig 9a as the dam height increased the usp area decreased which reduced the qt flux within the usp the sw area increased and the width of the mixing zone decreased larger density gradient these factors are theoretically favorable for a high qd flux however in reality the increasing dam height hindered the flow of fresh groundwater near the dam resulting in a low flow velocity of fresh groundwater near the sw mixing zone as a result less salt in the sw mixing zone was carried away by the fresh groundwater flow and less salt needed to be replenished by the saltwater circulation qd thus a decline in the qd flux was recorded in fig 9b additionally consistent with the change in the width of the discharge outfall wtfsgd in fig 9a the qf flux in fig 9b possessed a nonmonotonic relationship with the dam height and peaked at the minimum effective dam height of 0 368 in summary an increase in the height of subsurface dam reduced the water exchange at the sea boundary except for fresh groundwater discharge using the sgd fluxes in the base case as a reference the height variations of the subsurface dam led to decreases of 2 35 3 34 4 19 and 2 32 in the tide induced circulation qt density driven circulation qd fresh groundwater discharge qf and total efflux qtsgd respectively for the effective height range of the subsurface dam i e dh 0 368 fresh groundwater discharge peaked i e 1 04 times the reference flux at the minimum effective height and the tide induced circulation density driven circulation and total efflux reached the maximum values which were 94 93 and 95 of the results in the base case respectively 3 3 2 subsurface dam location the distribution of salt freshwater in the aquifer is shown in fig 10 for various locations of a subsurface dam dl as the dam moved inland increasing dl the usp sizes essentially remained unchanged while the sw intruded landward the height of the sw was raised near the dam and other regions were essentially identical to those of the base case fig 11 a presents the quantified results of the salinity distribution for different dam locations as the dam moved inland increasing dl the usp area ausp decreased and then increased reaching a minimum at the dam location of 0 146 this behavior may be due to the fact that the defined fixed height was the minimum effective height of subsurface dam at the first location of dl 0 069 in this situation the sw height at the dam location was basically the same as the dam height as well as the sw height in the base case that is to say the dam played a minor effect on the flow field at the seaward side and the usp region and thus the usp area was close to that under the no dam condition base case when the dam was moved to the location of dl 0 146 the dam height was greater than the sw height at the dam location and the inland freshwater discharge was compressed by the dam to flow above the dam crest thus the flow velocity of inland freshwater increased reducing the usp area as the dam continued to move inland and the distance from the usp increased the local changes in groundwater flow field caused by subsurface dam had less impact on the usp and the usp area gradually increased these factors ultimately resulted in a nonmonotonic correlation between the usp area and the dam location following the landward movement of the dam the sw area asw increased and the width of the discharge outfall wtfsgd decreased slightly the variations of the average widths of the mixing zones around the sw wtsw and usp wtusp were similar to the trends of the sw and usp areas respectively as the dam moved inland the water exchange across the aquifer sea interface is shown in fig 11b as the dam moved landward the qt flux within the usp decreased first and then increased which was consistent with the change in the usp area the qd flux within the sw increased due to the increase in sw size while the qf flux gradually decreased because of the reduction in the width of the discharge outfall the total efflux qtsgd from the sea boundary increased with the landward movement of the dam when the dam was close to the sea boundary e g dl 0 069 the fluxes of water exchange at the aquifer sea interface differed significantly from the results in the base case especially the qd flux as the dam approached the inland boundary e g dl 0 376 the sgd fluxes were close to the values in the base case i e 1 0 this indicates that the influence of local flow field changes caused by the subsurface dam on sgd decreased as the dam moved away from the sea boundary these results highlight the important role of the dam location for sgd overall compared with the results of the base case the sgd fluxes for the various dam locations were generally smaller the tide induced circulation qt density driven circulation qd fresh groundwater discharge qf and total efflux qtsgd were reduced by 0 6 0 19 6 3 and 0 8 respectively these results indicated that the effect of subsurface dam location on the reduction in sgd fluxes was not obvious which may be due to the height of subsurface dam in these cases the fixed dam height was the minimum effective height at the first location of dl 0 069 4 discussion although previous studies have revealed the characteristics of water exchange across the aquifer sea interface the presence of subsurface physical barriers and their impact on sgd have been neglected evans and wilson 2017 in this study we systematically explored the effect of the construction of subsurface physical barriers in coastal aquifers on sgd involving physical barriers including commonly used subsurface dams and cutoff walls in general the presence of physical barriers hindered the hydraulic connection between the upstream and downstream groundwater flow and the sgd fluxes were reduced compared with those without a barrier yet an abnormal trend occurred in the fresh groundwater discharge with a present subsurface dam when the dam height was close to the minimum effective height fresh groundwater discharge was greater than that before the construction of subsurface dam similar phenomenon was also observed in previous studies fang et al 2021b and chang et al 2019 found that fresh groundwater discharge peaked at the minimum effective dam height however the response of saline sgd to subsurface physical barriers was firstly confirmed in our study sgd is a hidden and important mechanism to transport dissolved chemicals from groundwater into the ocean and it plays an important role in coastal water quality and ecosystem rodellas et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 the present study found that the construction of subsurface physical barriers generally reduced the fresh and saline sgd fluxes relative to the results when no barrier was present for cutoff walls fresh sgd was decreased by a percentage of 17 64 and the reduction in saline sgd was 4 53 a negative value represents an increase fresh and saline sgds were reduced by 6 20 and 0 35 respectively under subsurface dam conditions fresh sgd is driven by the inland hydraulic gradient carrying chemical loads from land from the marine perspective the freshwater nutrients carbon and heavy metals delivered by fresh sgd can be regarded as new inputs santos et al 2021 for eutrophic or polluted coastal waters the presence of subsurface physical barriers and hence a reduced fresh sgd with its associated nutrients and pollutants might pose a favorable signal for the protection of coastal water quality for oligotrophic seas such as the mediterranean sea rodellas et al 2015 fresh sgd is a key source of nutrients to maintain marine productivity and the decline in fresh sgd caused by physical barriers is not conducive to the stability of coastal ecosystem saline sgd is usually larger than fresh sgd at most monitored sites and also roughly exceeds the input of river discharge at the global scale kwon et al 2014 luijendijk et al 2020 previous studies have suggested that saline sgd and its delivering nutrients are crucial for sustaining primary productivity and water quality beck et al 2017 for example the slow and continuous release of nutrients into surface water via saline sgd can alleviate seasonal changes in seawater nutrient content andrisoa et al 2019 the nutrients with a high concentration in coastal waters can also be degraded during the saline sgd circulation erler et al 2014 the presence of subsurface physical barriers leads to a decrease in the flux of saline sgd which is bound to affect its role in the water cycle material cycle and ecosystem therefore when studying the water exchange and material cycle across the aquifer sea interface the influence of subsurface physical barriers cannot be ignored in addition to the changes in the sgd fluxes the presence of subsurface physical barriers also affects the distribution of salt freshwater in coastal aquifers and the tube of fresh groundwater discharge thereby changing the location of the sgd outflow while this work only investigated homogeneous isotropic aquifers this is still true for real world aquifers with heterogeneous anisotropic conditions where the discharge locations are likewise influenced by the same observed effects at the aquifer sea interface subsurface physical barriers with different structures cause various changes in the location of freshwater discharge outfall for example when a cutoff wall with the same depth is located farther inland the discharge outfall moves seaward downward along the beach taking the location of the discharge outfall under the no barrier condition as a reference when the cutoff wall is located near to the sea boundary the discharge outfall lies above the reference and when the wall location is closer inland the discharge outfall is placed below the reference zheng et al 2022 and sun et al 2021 also investigated the effect of cutoff wall on the distribution of salt freshwater but they simplified the sea boundary ignoring tides and beach slopes and thus the above dynamic changes in intertidal groundwater were not observed in their studies the documented response of marine biota to sgd is quite variable and site specific and the sites subjected to fresh sgd provide favorable condition to enhance the growth rates of mussels and oysters andrisoa et al 2019 spalt et al 2020 similarly pisternick et al 2020 and starke et al 2020 revealed a positive association between increased growth rate and abundance of fish and fresh sgd sites variation in the location of sgd outflow induced by physical barriers can conceivably result in changes of the habitat locations of relevant marine organisms the construction of subsurface physical barriers alters the width of the salt freshwater mixing zone that represents the magnitude of the mixing effect the difference in the chemical composition of terrestrial freshwater and seawater generates a strong geochemical gradient in the mixing zone robinson et al 2018 thus the mixing zone is a key chemical reaction site in coastal aquifers determining the fate and flux of terrestrial and marine derived chemicals discharged into the sea heiss et al 2017 have found that terrestrial nitrates experience a strong denitrification process in the usp mixing zone with degradation rates of up to 100 for those under usual groundwater conditions in the present study fig 5 shows that as the depth of cutoff wall increased the widths of the mixing zones at the edge of the usp and sw increased and the flux of fresh groundwater discharge decreased these findings are consistent with those of chang et al 2022 who explored this topic under a simplified sea boundary no tides these changes led to an increase in the chemical reaction sites and a decline in the chemical load delivered by the fresh sgd which is conducive to improving the degradation efficiency of land derived chemicals prior to discharge the construction of subsurface physical barriers in coastal areas is designed to control seawater intrusion and protect fresh groundwater in upstream aquifers armanuos et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 zheng et al 2022 this study revealed that the presence of physical barriers generally reduced the sgd fluxes thereby conceivably altering the original coastal water environment and ecosystem therefore we suggest that the structural design of subsurface physical barriers should increase the sgd fluxes as much as possible under the premise of preventing seawater intrusion so as to alleviate the disturbance induced by physical barriers if physical barriers are close to the sea boundary the regions of fresh groundwater that are protected by the barriers increase but their influence on sgd also increases and the sgd fluxes decrease significantly conversely if the barriers are located farther inland their effect on the sgd is less pronounced but the intended effect of the physical barrier to protect freshwater areas is also reduced that is the location of subsurface physical barriers should be chosen to make a compromise between the protection of fresh groundwater and the reduced disturbance on sgd when the barrier location is fixed fig 9b shows that there is an effective height range for subsurface dams and in this range the fresh and saline sgds peak at the minimum effective height when the dam height is close to the minimum effective height e g 0 269 dh 0 470 the effects of subsurface dams on sgd fluxes are negligible similarly fig 5b demonstrates that fresh and saline sgds reach the maximum fluxes at the minimum effective depth of a cutoff wall for the effective depth range these findings provide basic guidance for the design of subsurface dam height and cutoff wall depth considering their comprehensive implications for seawater intrusion and sgd 5 conclusions this study used both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations to investigate the effect of subsurface physical barriers on the water exchange across the aquifer sea interface different types of physical barriers including cutoff walls and subsurface dams were examined the key findings are summarized as follows the construction of subsurface physical barriers altered the salinity distribution salt freshwater mixing and tube of fresh groundwater discharge in coastal aquifers at the aquifer sea interface subsurface physical barriers with different sizes and distances resulted in various changes in the location of freshwater discharge outfall for example as a cutoff wall moved inland the discharge outfall shifted seaward downward along the beach the water exchange across the aquifer sea interface was closely related to the structure of subsurface physical barriers with an increased height of a subsurface dam or the increase in the depth of a cutoff wall the fresh and saline sgd fluxes revealed a decreasing trend as the barrier moved inland the sgd fluxes increased while simultaneously the protection effect of the physical barrier weakened an abnormal change occurred in fresh groundwater discharge that decreased as the subsurface dam moved landward the presence of physical barriers hindered the hydraulic connection between the upstream and downstream groundwater flow and the sgd fluxes were reduced compared with those where no barrier was present for cutoff walls the change in the wall depth led to decreases in tide induced saltwater circulation of 25 33 density driven saltwater circulation of 10 30 fresh groundwater discharge of 17 60 and the total efflux of 18 36 for subsurface dams a series of dam heights resulted in decreases of 2 35 3 34 4 19 a negative value represents an increase and 2 32 in the tide induced saltwater circulation density driven saltwater circulation fresh groundwater discharge and total efflux respectively for an effective height range of the subsurface dam fresh and saline sgd fluxes peaked at the minimum effective height and fresh groundwater discharge tide induced circulation density driven circulation and total efflux were 104 94 93 and 95 of the results under the no barrier condition respectively notwithstanding the above findings real world aquifers usually experience a higher complexity than considered here regarding aquifer properties such as heterogeneity anisotropy inland water table variations multi component tidal signals and waves these complexities of coastal aquifers are known to affect the seawater intrusion and sgd processes future studies are required to investigate the joint effects of aquifer complexities and subsurface physical barriers on the water exchange across the aquifer sea interface nevertheless this study firstly provides a systematic assessment of the sgd fluxes in coastal aquifers where subsurface physical barriers have been constructed for seawater intrusion control the critical findings have been well clarified via the associated salinity distribution therefore the findings can provide a general framework that can be used to guide the prediction and monitoring of sgd behaviors in coastal aquifers where subsurface physical barriers are intended or have been constructed credit

2377,the water levels of inland lakes on the tibetan plateau are extremely sensitive to global climate change and can objectively reflect the temporal and spatial changes in local water resources however monthly and seasonal variations in lake water levels are difficult to monitor due to the lack of sufficient in situ gauges across mountainous areas moreover gedi products exhibit large uncertainties in mountainous surroundings in this paper taking qinghai lake as an example we first refined the raw data of the gedi and icesat 2 missions by implementing a quality control procedure involving outlier removal tailored to the characteristics of each mission then we analyzed the accuracy of each mission especially targeting factors that affect the water level retrievals in the gedi products third the bias between the two missions was adjusted by selecting the overlapping or adjacent observation dates finally we constructed dense temporal water level data by integrating the refined icesat 2 and gedi data data from water level stations and the dahiti and hydroweb datasets were also utilized for validation the results show that 1 very accurate results can be obtained from the icesat 2 atl13 product and the standard deviations of most observed days are under 0 05 m 2 the gedi products derived from algorithm 2 can offer more effective footprints than those from algorithm 1 with an improvement of approximately 9 78 moreover large differences exist among the different gedi beams and beams 1 and 2 are recommended for further analysis overall most beams overestimated the lake levels with a bias of 0 264 0 357 m 3 the long time series water levels showed a mean increasing trend of 0 243 m yr from 2018 to 2021 the relatively high water level periods were distributed mostly in august and september while the low water level periods were distributed mostly in february and march the combined water levels were very correlated with the dahiti and hydroweb datasets with r values larger than 0 8 and highly consistent with the observations from hydrological stations the inter year change range spanned from 0 015 m to 0 327 m and the intra year difference range varied from 0 03 m to 0 16 m and 4 integrating the gedi and icesat 2 missions allowed us to capture the monthly seasonal and annual dynamics of the lake water level and the results indicate that the combined dataset presents a valuable resource for hydrological and climatic change studies keywords gedi laser altimetry icesat 2 atl13 qinghai lake water level dynamics climate change data availability the gedi and icesat 2 data that support the findings of this study are available in earthdata search nasa gov the other two lake level public datasets were derived from the following resources available in the public domain https hydroweb theia land fr hydroweb and https dahiti dgfi tum de en 1 introduction water level fluctuations in endorheic lakes are sensitive to complex changes in regional precipitation evapotranspiration and glacier melting frappart et al 2018 kropáček et al 2012 talebmorad et al 2020 thus the dynamics of inland lakes are not only significant parameters for understanding the water balance in interior drainage basins but are also valuable indicators of climate change the tibetan plateau tp has the greatest number of high elevation inland lakes in the world and qinghai lake possesses the largest area among them in addition this lake is located in a typical area that is sensitive to climatic change and ecologically fragile wang et al 2019 javadinejad et al 2019 therefore case studies of qinghai lake s water level changes are very important and valuable however due to the harsh natural physiographic and climatic conditions in this region it is difficult to conduct field measurements over tp lakes even if some are accessible continually performing measurements and maintaining in situ gauges are costly endeavors luo et al 2021 fortunately the global ecosystem dynamics investigation gedi mission can provide multitrack and high temporal resolution observations between the latitudes of 51 6 n and 51 6 s and the advanced icesat 2 that is the follow up mission of the ice cloud and land elevation satellite icesat altimetry can also acquire unprecedented measurements of earth s surface these satellite missions have thus brought great prospects for lake level change monitoring in recent decades satellite altimetry including radar and laser altimetry has been extensively applied to water level retrievals of inland water bodies lakes rivers and reservoirs talebmorad and ostad ali askari 2022 busker et al 2019 crétaux et al 2011 velpuri et al 2012 initially radar altimeters were developed to monitor sea and ocean surface topography because of their ability to provide precise water surface elevations over large water bodies all weather operability and global data coverage radar altimeter missions such as geosat ers 1 2 topex poseidon envisat jason 1 2 3 cryosat 2 and sentinel 3 a and b are being used increasingly often for monitoring and evaluating water surface height levels of inland water bodies birkett and beckley 2010 calmant et al 2008 kleinherenbrink et al 2014 ghashghaie et al 2022 however the accuracy of such measurements can be affected by the extents of individual water bodies and by the retracking methods applied to returned waveforms guo et al 2009 wang et al 2019 compared to radar altimeters laser altimeters have smaller footprints and higher sampling densities making them more suitable for small water body observations many previous studies have investigated lake level changes over the tp using the geoscience laser altimeter system glas carried by icesat with decimeter accuracy zhang et al 2011 analyzed the lake level variations of qinghai lake and identified a mean increasing rate of 0 11 m yr from 2003 2009 phan et al 2012 found an average change rate of 0 20 m yr for 154 lakes larger than 1 km2 moreover by investigating the water levels of 105 closed lakes song et al 2014 found that seasonal lake level variations featured strong spatial and temporal heterogeneities icesat 2 was launched in september 2018 and equipped with the advanced topographic laser system atlas which is capable of detecting sensitivities at the photon level tian and shan 2021 the atlas instrument illuminates the earth s surface with six ground tracks simultaneously laser footprints are typically approximately 14 m in diameter and the distance between two footprints along the track is only 0 7 m compared with glas atlas can produce data at a much higher spatial resolution and denser sampling frequency zhang et al 2019 found that icesat 2 data contained nearly twice the lake coverage of tp lakes compared with icesat data and also had a higher altimetric accuracy the elevation difference was 2 cm at lake qinghai when compared to gauge data yuan et al 2020 evaluated the altimetric precision of icesat 2 atl13 data using gauge data collected from 30 reservoirs and extensively studied large lakes larger than 10 km2 in china their work showed that the icesat 2 mission greatly updated its altimetric capability and the relative altimetric error was 0 06 m while some mountainous and shallow lakes tended to have relatively large uncertainties dandabathula and rao 2020 validated the atl13 products with 46 observations consisting of near real time gauged data of 15 reservoirs and found that the maximum uncertainty observed was at the centimeter level the gedi launched on december 5th 2018 started collecting scientific data in operational mode on march 25th 2019 after a three month on orbit checkout it was attached to the international space station and collected data globally between latitudes of 51 6 n and 51 6 s the instrument can measure forest canopy heights canopy vertical structures and surface elevations to characterize important carbon and water cycling processes biodiversity and habitats adam et al 2020 fayad et al 2020 analyzed the quality of gedi data over 8 lakes in switzerland and found that the bias between gedi elevations and in situ data ranged from 13 8 cm to 9 8 cm xiang et al 2021 validated and compared the gedi icesat and icesat 2 data using in situ data from 22 gauging stations over the great lakes and lower mississippi river and reported that the root mean square errors of the three missions were 0 28 m 0 10 m and 0 06 m respectively with the goal of combining multiple altimeters for retrieving long term lake level series wang et al 2019 constructed the topex poseidon family altimeter dataset from october 1992 to december 2017 resulting in accuracies of 17 cm for topex poseidon and 10 cm for jason 1 2 3 over ngangzi co using cryosat 2 jason 2 3 and sentinel 3a data chen and liao 2020 determined that the level of qinghai lake had an increase rate of 0 443 m yr from 2016 to 2019 when analyzing lake level changes in the middle and lower yangtze river basin using the long term 2002 2017 observations of icesat envisat and cryosat 2 the authors found that there was a significant correlation between the satellite altimetry water levels and measured water levels with r values between 0 908 and 0 989 p 0 001 li et al 2020 by integrating icesat icesat 2 data the global surface water dataset and the hydrolakes dataset luo et al 2021 proposed plateau scale research of lake level changes over the tp from 2003 to 2019 they reported 242 lakes with areas greater than 1 km2 that could be observed by combining icesat and icesat 2 data and the mean water level change rate of these lakes was 0 20 0 04 m yr frappart et al 2021 provided a comprehensive evaluation of the performances of the previous radar and lidar altimetry missions according to their acquisition in mountainous areas and revealed that very accurate results could also be obtained using icesat 2 data however more contrasting results were obtained when using gedi in a relatively short period xu et al 2022 revealed the seasonal trends and cycles of lake level variations over the tp by combining icesat icesat 2 sentinel 3a 3b and cryosat 2 data demonstrating that qinghai lake rose at a rate of 0 17 0 001 m yr from 2003 to 2020 in general in the past two decades the number of in situ hydrological stations in the world has declined lawford et al 2013 satellite altimetry is becoming an important tool for monitoring lake surface heights however lake surface level dynamic monitoring still faces many difficulties such as large altimetric errors due to mixed signals contaminated by the surrounding lands large spatial gaps between tracks and temporal gaps that impede detailed variation descriptions to date the application and validation capacities of icesat 2 and gedi data over inland waters are very limited as only 3 years of icesat 2 data and 2 years of gedi were accumulated at the time of their respective product releases in particular contradictory results have been obtained when applying gedi data to study mountainous lakes as icesat 2 and gedi are operating simultaneously combining these two missions can provide a mutual accuracy verification and increase the temporal density of observations allowing us to cope with temporal gaps in data more analyses are necessary to determine the potential of using these missions to retrieve water levels therefore the objectives of this paper are 1 to provide a robust strategy to delete outliers generate accurate lake water levels from individual missions and analyze various factors that influence the accuracy of inland water level measurements derived from the gedi laser altimetry platform 2 to evaluate the performance of the combination of gedi and icesat 2 data in retrieving inland water dynamics and 3 to track the latest dynamic water levels of qinghai lake this paper is divided into five sections a description of the altimetry datasets obtained for the studied lake and a detailed water level extraction method are provided in section 2 the individual water level results retrieved from both products and comparisons and validations of these data with the hydrostation data and two other public datasets are given in section 3 followed by a discussion in section 4 in the last section the main conclusions are presented 2 data and methods 2 1 altimetric data in qinghai lake the latitude and longitude ranges of qinghai lake are 36 32 n 37 15 n and 99 36 e 100 47 e respectively as the largest inland lake in china it is located on the northeast edge of the qinghai tibet plateau located within the transition zone among the qinghai tibet alpine region the loess plateau and the northwest arid region it is an ideal place to study climate responses water balances and hydrological processes zhao et al 2017 in this study we utilized the level 2a gedi product containing ground elevation canopy top height and relative return energy metrics derived from geolocated waveforms the height data are based on the wgs 84 ellipsoid and the inland surface water product atl13 of icesat 2 providing the along track orthometric heights of lakes rivers and wetlands with reference to the earth gravitational model 2008 egm2008 was obtained when the first draft of this article was written gedi data from 25 april 2019 to 3 august 2021 and icesat 2 data from 31 october 2018 to 3 july 2021 were available https search earthdata nasa gov among the current available data products the higher quality v002 version of the gedi product and v004 version of the icesat 2 product were adopted the total available number of days in the gedi and icesat 2 datasets are 92 days and 76 days respectively table 1 among them the highest observation frequency is 11 days in august 2020 while the observations frequencies of most months are 4 10 days the specific laser footprints of the two missions were distributed over qinghai lake as shown in fig 2 2 1 1 gedi l2a the gedi instrument consists of 3 lasers producing a total of 8 ground transect beams spaced approximately 600 m apart on the earth s surface in the cross track direction relative to the flight direction each beam transect consists of 30 m footprint samples spaced approximately every 60 m along the track the coverage laser is split into two transects that are then each dithered in total producing four ground transects the other two full power lasers are dithered producing two ground transects each the configuration of the ground tracks is shown in fig 1 a hofton et al 2019 the instrument is a full waveform lidar instrument that captures the shapes of the transmitted and reflected laser waveforms in real time it enables a precise range to the reflecting surface to be calculated for every shot over flat terrain e g plains or water surfaces the shape of the received waveform looks similar to that of the transmitted pulse however photons may be reflected from multiple surfaces within the footprint over complex e g stepped or sloped terrain resulting in a received waveform with multiple modes fayad et al 2021 the interpretation of these laser pulses in postprocessing affects the accuracy of the surface elevation vegetation structure relative canopy height results etc as mentioned in the algorithm theoretical basis document the l1b product is issued by six configurations of algorithms a1 to a6 each representing different thresholds and smoothing settings hofton et al 2019 correspondingly the l2a geolocated elevation and height products inherit the results of these multiple algorithm settings the n in the parameter elev lowestmode an represents the specific algorithm the position of the ground return within a waveform is determined using the position of the last detected peak which is dependent on the width of the second gaussian filter smoothwidth zcross the widths of algorithm 1 and 4 were fixed to 6 5 ns and the widths of the remaining algorithms 2 3 5 and 6 were set to 3 5 ns fayad et al 2020 therefore the six algorithms could be divided into two groups in our study only algorithm 1 a1 and algorithm 2 a2 which can represent each group were tested moreover gedi uses its own global positioning system inertial measurement unit and information from three star trackers that permit its plane positioning accuracy to remain within 10 m 1 σ dubayah et al 2020 the product contains a preliminary set of quality flags and metrics that can be used to filter shots with poor geolocation performances waveforms of bad signal quality and waveforms affected by clouds or other land surface conditions roy et al 2021 thus the quanlity flag an flag and num detectedmodes an metric were adopted in our study to obtain accurate water level retrievals 2 1 2 icesat 2 atl13 icesat 2 is placed at a 500 km altitude in a 92 inclination sun synchronous orbit with a 91 day repeat cycle and an equatorial ground track spacing of approximately 28 8 km the atlas instrument operates at a higher repetition rate thus improving the along track spatial resolution icesat 2 products are organized by ground track with ground tracks 1l and 1r forming pair one ground tracks 2l and 2r forming pair two and ground tracks 3l and 3r forming pair three the distance between the left and right beams of each pair is 90 m pair tracks are approximately 3 km and 2 5 km apart in the across track and along track directions respectively fig 1 b roy et al 2021 the beams within each pair have different transmit energies so called weak and strong beams with an energy ratio between them of approximately 1 4 the relative position of the strong and weak beams on the ground depends on the orientation of the icesat 2 observatory which changes approximately twice per year to maximize solar illumination neumann et al 2020 numerous subproducts generated from the level 2 master product called atl03 are available to the public through the national snow and ice data center one of these products namely atl13 provides along track and near shore water surface height distributions within the water masks along with the mean standard deviation and slope of each beam as well as statistics jasinski et al 2019 the water surface heights offer geodetic heights above the wgs 84 ellipsoid itrf2014 reference frame and orthometric heights based on the earth gravitational model 2008 egm2008 geoid 2 1 3 auxiliary data in this study the boundary of qinghai lake was determined from its year 2018 vector format file shapefile which was downloaded from the national basic geographic information centre http ngcc sbsm gov cn the lake boundary was then used to extract elevation footprints to unify the vertical data of icesat 2 and gedi we used the egm2008 model to convert the gedi heights based on wgs84 to heights based on egm2008 the conversion software tools of the emg2008 geoid model can be downloaded from the geographiclib htttps geographiclib sourceforge io html geoid html in addition to verify the integrated water level results the available in situ gauge data of xiashe station from 2018 to 2021 were collected from the qinghai water conservancy information network https slt qinghai gov cn subject cid 24 time series products from two other public databases were obtained to derive lake levels from multiple radar altimeters designed for inland water bodies and these lake levels were used for comparison the hydrological time series of inland waters dahiti is maintained by the deutsches geodätisches forschungsinstitut schwatke et al 2015 and the hydroweb database is constructed by the laboratoire d etudes en géophysique et océanographie spatiales yue et al 2021 the elevation reference data were the ggm02c and eigen 6c4 gravity field models 2 2 water level extraction fig 3 depicts the processing steps in the proposed method first the laser footprints over qinghai lake were roughly extracted using the lake boundary then the outlier deletion of each mission was implemented subsequently the water level at each track was extracted and the corresponding accuracy assessment was conducted the effective tracks were then used as the inputs on specific dates and the final heights of each mission were estimated by calculating averages to evaluate the lake level accuracies of the two missions the standard deviation was selected to assess the single track and mean lake levels of each individual day derived from the effective tracks before integration the bias between the two missions was adjusted using data from the overlapping or adjacent dates finally the long time series lake levels and corresponding accuracies were constructed and validated using the in situ data and the dahiti and hydroweb datasets 2 2 1 outlier detection due to the effects of atmospheric conditions and clouds not all altimetric observations are effective hui et al 2016 therefore outliers should be removed before estimating the mean lake levels for example the height distributions of 8 gedi beams on 12 sep 2019 fig 4 a and 6 icesat 2 tracks on 7 sep 2019 fig 4 b illustrate that the height differences among different gedi beams are larger than the differences among icesat 2 tracks and the gedi data contain many extreme outliers while the icesat 2 data have small differences among different tracks and few extreme outliers thus in this study a combination of criteria was applied to remove outliers according to their characteristics for gedi l2a in the first step the quality flag quality flag an and mode number flag num detectedmode an contained in the products were used a quality flag an term the value equal to 1 indicates that the waveforms met the energy sensitivity amplitude and real time surface tracking quality criteria then the num detectedmode an flag value of 1 was selected to guarantee that the waveform returned from the lake surface second the estimation of the elevation bin with 1 interval was implemented a step size of 1 m was used to address the water surface slopes associated with various causes the lake water heights within the maximum bin that possess the highest frequency were preserved the rest outside the 1 m interval from the maximum bin were discarded as outliers third the mean water level was calculated based on the remaining heights and the root mean square rms values of the residuals between the heights and the mean water level were estimated the values were considered outliers if the absolute differences between the observations and the mean water level were greater than the 3 rms criterion finally even if a single beam met the above requirements if the differences among different beams on the same day were larger than 1 m the mean value of the beams of the specific day was removed due to the large uncertainty for icesat 2 atl13 the interquartile range iqr was adopted the height outliers were defined using eqs 1 and 2 then the 3 rms criterion was applied in case the first step did not work well eqs 1 and 2 are expressed as follows 1 iqr q 3 q 1 2 h outlier q 1 1 5 i q r h outlier q 3 1 5 i q r where q 1 is the first quartile q 3 is the third quartile and h outlier is the abnormal height 2 2 2 inter mission bias adjustment it is very important to adjust the biases between different missions before combining multi mission data and constructing time series records absolute calibration using tide gauge data is the most common method schwatke et al 2015 to avoid interference with altimetric signals the fixed stations should be far enough from land and small enough such that the site does not impede the altimeter response otherwise the method may be unusable when measured data at fixed sites are lacking in addition two other methods crossover analysis and collinear analysis have also been employed to adjust the inter satellite bias for global and regional studies bosch et al 2014 however in situ gauge stations and simultaneous crossover points are not available for most lakes so these two methods were not options in this study in this paper a simple relative calibration method was employed to estimate the bias between the gedi and icesat 2 datasets assuming that the surface of a lake is a flat plane the lake levels observed by mission a should ideally be equal to those simultaneously measured by mission b however because of the existence of bias and noises such as waves and seiches these differences are not equal zero in reality and are calculated as follows 3 δ i h i a h i b where i 1 2 k represents the number of pair samples in the overlapping period of the two missions δ i is the difference between the pair samples and h i a and h i b are the water levels observed by gedi and icesat 2 respectively generally two missions do not overfly the same lake in the same epoch therefore to ensure that there are enough pair samples to accurately estimate the bias we broadly selected the data taken on the same or adjacent days for the bias adjustment process because interpolation among adjacent days might introduce interpolation errors when calculating the differences we assumed that the lake level would not change suddenly among most adjacent dates thus in our study we did not consider interpolation effect in addition xiang et al 2021 compared water level retrievals from icesat 2 and gedi as well as icesat 1 and validated them against in situ data from 22 gauging stations at various scales in the great lakes the results showed that icesat 2 can provide lake water level retrievals with an unprecedented accuracy rmse 0 06 m biases 0 01 0 05 m thus if the differences between the pair samples are larger than 1 m the observation result of icesat 2 is taken as the water level of that day and the gedi observation results are discarded as abnormal values supposing the remaining differences obey a normal distribution the biases can be estimated from these differences using the maximum likelihood estimation method 2 2 3 accuracy assessment and validation altimetric errors can be quantitatively calculated when gauge water levels are available however gauge data are not accessible from most lakes in high elevation areas therefore in this study the standard deviation sd of the mean water level height was taken as an indicator of the altimetric uncertainty to present the measurement error of the estimated water levels considering that the final lake water level was calculated from multi beam observations taken over the water surface the final lake water level would be precise if the measurement uncertainty was low to validate the accuracy of the water level extraction results the monthly and yearly changes of the available in situ gauge data of xiashe station dahiti and hydroweb database were compared and the differences were analyzed 3 results and analysis after outliers were removed the water levels of qinghai lake from october 2018 to august 2021 were derived from the two missions since no in situ gauge data of each gedi observation day were available for absolute validation icesat 2 data were employed as the benchmark for the following validation and calibration of lake levels resulting from the gedi mission first the processing algorithm acquisition time and beam intensity of the gedi data that may have affected the water levels were discussed and quantitatively analyzed then the biases between the two missions were adjusted and long time series monthly lake level time series were constructed 3 1 lake levels retrieved by icesat 2 fig 5 displays the water level dynamics and sds retrieved from each icesat 2 observation the lowest water level of 3196 87 m occurred on 3 dec 2018 and the highest water level of 3197 99 m occurred on 2 oct 2020 in 2019 the water levels presented an increase from january until august when the lake reached its maximum water level and then declined in september before increasing again in october and november and finally declining in december a similar trend occurred in 2020 generally the water level of qinghai lake has increased over the last three years the sds of most days were under 0 05 m and the mean sd of all observations was 0 03 m therefore the water levels of icesat 2 could be taken as the benchmark to evaluate the gedi observation results 3 2 lake levels retrieved by gedi 3 2 1 algorithm 1 versus algorithm 2 after removing the outliers we found 59 days and 68 days effectively measured via algorithm a1 and a2 with effective rates of 64 13 and 73 91 of the total 92 gedi days respectively in the common 59 days obtained by both algorithms the differences of the retrieved water levels between algorithm 1 and algorithm 2 were extremely small with a mean value of approximately 1 cm fig 6 meaning that there were basically no differences between the lake water level retrieval results the mean sds of the corresponding retrieval results were 0 09 m and 0 12 m respectively among the effective days obtained using algorithm 1 and algorithm 2 the numbers of days on which all 8 beams collected valid data were 30 days and 50 days accounting for 50 84 and 73 53 of the total respectively since there is no significant difference between the water level inversion results and accuracy and the algorithm 2 has more effective data in this paper we selected the results of algorithm 2 for the following analysis 3 2 2 daytime observation versus nighttime observation the results from algorithm a2 were grouped by time the temporal range from 8 00 to 20 00 was considered daytime and the rest of the 24 hour cycle was considered nighttime fig 7 shows the sd comparison of the gedi daytime and nighttime observations the results showed that the sds varied from 0 018 m to 0 312 m for the 38 days acquired in the daytime with a mean sd of 0 115 m for the 30 days acquired in the nighttime the sds spanned from 0 019 m to 0 295 m with a mean of 0 110 m overall from the perspective of the average error the influence of the observation time on water levels showed little difference between daytime and nighttime 3 2 3 coverage beams versus full power beams to examine the influence of the beam strength on the accuracy of the water level observations the sds of different beams were analyzed the mean water levels were computed from the coverage beams beam 0000 beam 0001 beam 0010 and beam 0011 were marked 1 2 3 and 4 in turn and full power beams beam 0101 beam 0110 beam 1000 and beam 1011 were abbreviated as 5 6 7 and 8 in turn among the 68 days considered the numbers of lacking data days were 11 days for the coverage beams and 2 days for the full power beams fig 8 shows the sd comparison of the coverage beams and full power beams showing that the sds of the coverage beams were generally larger than those of the full power beams the average sds of the coverage beam and full power beam results were 0 116 m and 0 100 m respectively the number of days with full power beam observations and the corresponding sds revealed that the strong beams obtained more effective observations and had higher accuracies than the weak beams furthermore fig 9 illustrates the differences between each gedi beam and icesat 2 track that were observed with the same or adjacent dates the specific mean differences between each beam and the icesat 2 results were 0 104 m 0 054 m 0 212 m 0 214 m 0 260 m 0 293 m 0 170 m and 0 109 m as a result systematic differences were identified among the different beams and the largest biases occurred in beams 3 4 5 and 6 followed by beams 7 and 8 beams 1 and 2 had the smallest biases 3 3 bias adjustment between gedi and icesat 2 twenty two paired samples were found in the overlapping observations obtained on the same or adjacent days between the gedi and icesat 2 datasets from table 2 it can be seen that there were 4 days with same date observations and the intervals between the remaining instances were 1 5 days fig 10 visually displays the differences between the gedi and icesat 2 datasets the red dots are outliers that should be removed before estimating the mean bias the mean bias and sd are represented by the green and red dashed lines respectively compared to icesat 2 the negative difference of 4 days means that these gedi underestimated the lake levels on these observation days the rest are all positive meaning that most gedi observations reflected overestimated water levels there were 3 days on which the differences were larger than 1 m october 6 and december 1 in 2019 and june 26 in 2020 on which significant differences of 1 704 m 1 449 m and 1 663 m respectively were observed according to the bias adjustment principle discussed above the corresponding gedi observed values were deleted as abnormal records and the icesat 2 observed values were thus kept as the water levels of the corresponding days the mean bias of the remaining 19 days was 0 264 0 357 m revealing that gedi overestimated the water levels therefore the adjusted gedi lake levels were calculated by subtracting the mean bias from the original values 3 4 obtaining and validating long time series lake levels by integrating gedi and icesat 2 datasets fig 11 illustrates the integrated lake water level dynamics the red crosses mark the adjusted gedi results and their corresponding sds for the specifically acquired days spanning from october 2018 to july 2021 it can be seen that the combined dataset significantly densified the monitoring time compared to each mission alone from the water level of an individual day except for several relatively high adjusted water level days retrieved by gedi the overall days constituting the relatively high water level periods were distributed mostly in august and september followed by october and november while the days constituting relatively low water level periods were distributed mostly in february and march overall the water levels showed upward trends assuming that the yearly water levels in 2018 and 2021 could be roughly expressed with observed months the annual average water levels for 2018 2019 2020 and 2021 were 3197 019 m 3197 252 m 3197 607 m and 3197 748 m respectively compared to each previous year the yearly increases were 0 233 m 0 355 m and 0 141 m the reference average annual growth value from 2018 to 2021 was 0 243 m yr which should represent an underestimation of the yearly increasing rate due to the lack of data on the higher level 2021 season the corresponding annual average water level data from the xiashe water level station showed water levels of 3195 41 m 3195 97 m 3196 34 m and 3196 51 m showing increases of 0 56 m 0 37 m and 0 17 m compared to each previous year the corresponding average annual increase was 0 367 m yr overall from the perspective of inter annual changes it can be seen that the water level of qinghai lake showed an upward trend over the four years of study to further evaluate the validity of our integrated results we used monitoring data from the dahiti and hydroweb databases the water levels and the uncertainty of each individual day are shown in fig 12 for the inter year changes from 2018 to 2021 the increases in dahiti were 0 539 0 318 m and 0 146 m with a mean rate of 0 334 m yr and those in hydroweb were 0 416 m 0 444 m and 0 216 m with a mean rate of 0 359 m yr to compare the three datasets the days with same day observations or with an interval of two adjacent days were selected from fig 13 a it can be seen that our combined results acquired more data in a relatively short period and their water levels all presented upward trends from 2018 to 2021 the subfigure in the bottom right hand corner displayed the change trend of the common eight days among these three datasets demonstrating their good consistency fig 13 b and c further illustrate the correlations r values between our results and the other two datasets the overlapping days in the dahiti and hydroweb datasets were 41 and 17 respectively and the r values of both exceeded 0 8 indicating the validity of our monitoring results fig 14 further compares and analyses the inter annual and intra annual differences among the four data sources compared to the xiashe station fig 14 a the differences between our results the dahiti dataset and the hydroweb dataset and the gauge data were 0 33 m 0 02 m and 0 14 m respectively from 2018 to 2019 the large difference between our results and the water station data from 2018 to 2019 may have been caused by the lack of data in the first three seasons of 2018 however the corresponding differences were 0 02 m 0 06 m and 0 08 m respectively from 2019 to 2020 indicating that our retrieved results were more consistent with the gauging station data in this period the differences for 2020 to 2021 were 0 06 m 0 02 m and 0 05 m respectively the relatively small difference increase can be attributed to the limited data in 2021 because 2019 and 2020 have complete whole year observation data we compared only the intra year changes during these two years fig 14 b for 2019 the water levels revealed by our integrated results at the beginning and end of 2019 were 3196 972 m and 3197 319 m respectively with an increase of 0 347 m throughout the year the corresponding levels from xiashe station were 3195 71 m and 3196 09 m respectively and the water level rose by 0 38 m the difference was 0 03 m indicating that the integrated water levels were highly consistent with those measured at the hydrometric station the increases in the dahiti and hydroweb data were 0 364 m and 0 500 m with differences from the xiashe station data of 0 02 m and 0 12 m respectively in 2020 the yearly increases in our results the xiashe station data the dahiti dataset and the hydroweb dataset were 0 163 m 0 32 m 0 376 m and 0 550 m respectively the differences between the three datasets and the xiashe station data were 0 16 m 0 06 m and 0 23 m respectively obviously the increase from the beginning to the end of each year was relatively small in our results which may have been affected by the fact that most of the dates used to retrieve the average water level in january came from gedi table 1 which overestimated the early season water levels fig 15 shows the monthly average water levels from the intra annual changes in 2019 it can be seen that the lake water levels in january and february were relatively high before declining in march and subsequently gradually increasing from april to october compared to the may and july levels there was a downward fluctuation throughout june and august before the water level again reached higher levels in september and october finally in winter november and december the water level dropped again the year 2020 presented similar characteristics and trends relatively low water levels occurred in february and march while higher water levels occurred in august september and october however there was an upward trend from february to april and a downward trend from may to july in 2021 on this basis we also calculated statistics on seasonal changes from october to december the average water levels each year from 2018 to 2020 were 3197 019 m 3197 598 m and 3197 799 m exhibiting increase rates of 0 580 m yr and 0 202 m yr respectively the increase rates in the first three quarters of each year from 2019 to 2020 were 0 423 m yr 0 491 m yr and 0 602 m yr compared to 2020 the increase rates in the first two quarters of the 2021 year were 0 342 m yr and 0 140 m yr the corresponding monthly seasonal and annual variations in the dahiti and hydroweb datasets were also analyzed fig 16 comparing the 2019 and 2020 data in fig 15 with those in fig 16 our results presented the variations within all months of the year however the dahiti product lacked data for one month in 2020 and the hydroweb dataset lacked records for half a year in 2019 and for one month in 2020 indicating that combining the icesat 2 and gedi datasets can reflect more detailed temporal changes excluding elevation deviations due to the instrument biases of altimeters and geoid differences it can be seen that the water levels of both datasets reflected rising trends over the last four years relatively high water level occurred in september and october while low water levels occurred in february and march these trends were consistent with our research results however obvious subseasonal differences occurred among the datasets for example in 2019 our data showed a downward trend from january to april where an upward trend could be observed in both the dahiti and hydroweb datasets a similar difference occurred in 2021 when our results indicated an increase from january to march while the dahiti and hydroweb datasets indicated decreases comparing to the results obtained for the month of april neither of the two other datasets showed any large increase in may however our results showed a decline of approximately 0 265 m 4 discussion when retrieving lake levels whether directly using satellite altimetric data or integrating other remote sensing data the key is to accurately extract the effective footprints over lakes and evaluate the accuracies of both the original data and extracted results in this paper we combined data from two newly launched laser altimetry missions gedi and icesat 2 to monitor lake water level dynamics over the tibetan plateau area specifically taking qinghai lake as an example we obtained the daily monthly seasonal and yearly lake level variations from 2018 to 2021 from the gedi l2a data product and icesat 2 atl13 product from the above results two aspects could be further investigated in future research first the accuracy of the current results should be improved as discussed in part 4 1 second the results and the factors that potentially caused the observed lake level changes should be linked as described in part 4 2 4 1 factors affecting the lake level extraction accuracy the sds of the gedi data ranged from 0 018 m to 0 312 m with an average of 0 109 m fig 11 because gedi overestimated the water levels even after the bias adjustment the gedi s overall water levels were relatively high and the sds were larger than those of icesat 2 for example the maximum gedi measured water level of 3198 365 m occurred on september 13 2020 and the maximum sd of 0 312 m occurred on march 29 2021 for the integrated total of 126 days the sds spanned from 0 005 m to 0 312 m with an average of 0 061 m for most dates the sds were below 0 20 m the specific dynamics of the individual days and uncertainties in the dahiti and hydroweb datasets are shown in fig 12 fig 12 a indicates that the dahiti dataset had dense data and a high precision the uncertainty in this dataset ranged from 0 001 m to 0 095 m with a mean value of 0 008 m hydroweb presented relatively sparse data fig 12 b with relatively large uncertainties in 2018 and the first half of 2019 with the whole uncertainty range spanning from 0 017 m to 0 260 m with a mean of 0 113 m compared to the results obtained from dahiti the accuracy of our integrated results still needed to be further improved in addition our results and methodology were compared to the recent results and approaches of yuan et al 2020 and fayad et al 2020 who evaluated the performances of the icesat 2 and gedi datasets respectively with in situ data compared to their work we performed a more rigorous method to remove outliers in addition the iqr 3 sigma criterion and quality flags were also adopted to derive more accurate water levels with an average sd of 0 03 m for icesat 2 and an average sd of 0 109 m for gedi the relative altimetric error and uncertainty of icesat 2 were reported to be 0 06 m and 0 02 m respectively yuan et al 2020 and in fayad et al 2020 the biases between the gedi elevations and in situ data of eight studied lakes ranged from 13 8 cm to 9 8 cm with the sds of the mean differences ranging from 14 5 to 31 6 cm by comparison it can be seen that our strict method improved the accuracy of the water level inversion results even so in our results some abnormal water levels and several relatively large differences occurred between the two missions table 2 illustrating that although tailored criteria were taken some water levels from the gedi still could not represent the real water levels which may have been caused by the data product quality beck et al 2020 annual lake area changes may have also affected the screening of laser footprints over the lake therefore for the next step the lake area variations were considered using annual high resolution optical images in addition when the satellites had off pointing angles the plane position deviation would also affect the laser altimetry accuracy assume that the orbit height of the satellite is approximately h 400 km the laser pointing angle is with the measurement error δ and the terrain slope is s the elevation error δ h caused by the satellite pointing angle and terrain surface fluctuations can be approximately expressed using eq 4 gardner 1992 4 δ h h δ tan s when the off nadir pointing angle is equal to 6 with a 1 measurement error assuming a water slope s of 0 the elevation error δh is equal to 0 204 m more elevation errors simulated under different conditions are listed in table 3 when the slope and pointing measurement error were constant the pointing angle seriously affected the elevation accuracy to ensure the accuracy of the water surface elevation measurements data taken at small pointing angles should be selected in future studies similarly the error in the atl13 product may have been inherited from atl03 which primarily contained geolocated ellipsoidal heights for each time tagged photon event downlinked from the atlas sensor residual errors in the water height backscatter model and related algorithms may still influence the accuracies of these values due to specular backscattered lambertian backscattered and solar lambertian backscattered light from the water surface 4 2 factors driving lake water level variations our results revealed that the lake level of qinghai lake increased by an average annual of approximately 0 24 m yr from 2018 to 2021 this finding is consistent with the trends demonstrated by the latest studies chen and liao 2020 xu et al 2022 among them the largest annual increment of 0 56 m occurred in 2019 fig 13 a this increase can be mainly attributed to abnormally high annual precipitation 457 3 mm over the qinghai lake basin in this year the qinghai meteorological bureau also reported that 2019 was defined as an abnormal wet year leading to the continuously increasing runoff of all rivers in the basin and causing the water level of qinghai lake to continue to rise fig 17 shows the precipitation changes at buha station the buha river is the longest and largest river in the basin contributing almost half of the total runoff to the lake zhang et al 2011 in the study area precipitation months are mainly concentrated from july to september further explaining why the relatively high water levels occur mostly in august and september many previous studies have also revealed that over the past half century the water level of qinghai lake presented increasing variations a rapid increase in the lake area was observed from 2005 to 2016 caused by increased river runoff due to glacier ablation and precipitation tang et al 2018 fang et al 2019 demonstrated that the major cause of water level changes 93 13 was the combined effect of precipitation and evaporation during the 1960 2016 period while catchment modifications induced by human activities were very limited during this period 6 87 using a meteorological dataset collected from 1991 to 2017 chen et al 2022 indicated that precipitation has the greatest impact on the water volume variations of qinghai lake followed by the accumulated temperature and evaporation fan et al 2021 investigated the abnormal changes from 1970 to 2018 and revealed that the rapid water level recovery observed in recent years can be attributed to the substantial increases in several key abnormal wet years such as 2005 2012 2015 2017 and 2018 the lake level variations coincide with annual precipitation rather than temperature or evaporation however seasonal variations in lake levels and the spatial trend patterns differ considerably among different parts of the whole tp and the factors driving lake distribution dynamics are still under debate phan et al 2013 one viewpoint supports that increasing precipitation was the primary driver behind the rapid expansion of the lake and permafrost degradation may have contributed a significant amount of water to accelerate the continuous lake expansion in the endorheic basin in recent years liu et al 2021 pang et al 2021 showed that the rapid increase in the water volumes of closed lakes over different subzones of the tp could be used to partly explain the observed spatial and temporal heterogeneities of precipitation and temperature therefore in further studies the use of additional available data such as direct precipitation snow melt glacial melt moisture condition evaporation and rainwater runoff data would promote our further understanding of the driving factors of lake dynamics and global climate change over the tp 5 conclusion obtaining accurate lake level fluctuations is necessary for solving the high uncertainties regarding the water balance of the tibetan plateau basin lakes located in this region are surrounded by high elevation rough terrain the surface environment of which varies seasonally and it is more difficult to measure the dynamics of these lakes than of lakes elsewhere new altimetry satellites provide a solution for monitoring water level changes in areas without in situ gauging data in this study the recent water level dynamics of lake qinghai are examined by integrating refined icesat 2 and gedi data a tailored scheme is implemented to refine the raw data products first and then the factors that affected the accuracy of the gedi data were analyzed the icesat 2 laser altimetry data exhibit a strong capability for monitoring the lake level with a very high accuracy the gedi dataset has a dense temporal advantage and can monitor the lake level for a maximum of 8 days in a month though the accuracy of these data is inferior to that of the icesat 2 data and large differences exist among different beams most of which overestimated the water levels by 0 264 0 357 m the availability of the gedi algorithm 2 footprints was higher than that of the algorithm 1 footprints and beams 1 and 2 were recommended for further application compared to the results obtained from the dahiti dataset the accuracy of our integrated results still needs to be further improved and the factors affecting the accuracy extraction such as the slant angle and pointing measurement error of the gedi data need to be further investigated our integrated results the in situ measurements the dahiti dataset and the hydroweb dataset demonstrate increase rates ranging from 0 243 to 0 367 m yr during the 2018 to 2021 period the relatively high water level periods are distributed mostly in august and september followed by in october and november while the lower water level periods are distributed mostly in february and march the main driving factor inducing high water levels was surging annual precipitation especially in 2019 the inter year and intra year comparisons between the above four sources showed that the validation of our results and the intra year changes in 2019 with relatively rich observation data over all 12 months were strongly consistent with the in situ lake level measurements with a difference of 0 03 m this finding confirms that the constructed long time series lake level dataset allows us to capture the monthly seasonal and annual cycles of lake level variations and can serve as a valuable tool for hydrological and climatic studies when hydrological station measured data are lacking comprehensive examinations of lake level changes will become possible once rich gedi and icesat 2 data become available in the next few years funding this research was funded by the open fund of state key laboratory of remote sensing

2377,the water levels of inland lakes on the tibetan plateau are extremely sensitive to global climate change and can objectively reflect the temporal and spatial changes in local water resources however monthly and seasonal variations in lake water levels are difficult to monitor due to the lack of sufficient in situ gauges across mountainous areas moreover gedi products exhibit large uncertainties in mountainous surroundings in this paper taking qinghai lake as an example we first refined the raw data of the gedi and icesat 2 missions by implementing a quality control procedure involving outlier removal tailored to the characteristics of each mission then we analyzed the accuracy of each mission especially targeting factors that affect the water level retrievals in the gedi products third the bias between the two missions was adjusted by selecting the overlapping or adjacent observation dates finally we constructed dense temporal water level data by integrating the refined icesat 2 and gedi data data from water level stations and the dahiti and hydroweb datasets were also utilized for validation the results show that 1 very accurate results can be obtained from the icesat 2 atl13 product and the standard deviations of most observed days are under 0 05 m 2 the gedi products derived from algorithm 2 can offer more effective footprints than those from algorithm 1 with an improvement of approximately 9 78 moreover large differences exist among the different gedi beams and beams 1 and 2 are recommended for further analysis overall most beams overestimated the lake levels with a bias of 0 264 0 357 m 3 the long time series water levels showed a mean increasing trend of 0 243 m yr from 2018 to 2021 the relatively high water level periods were distributed mostly in august and september while the low water level periods were distributed mostly in february and march the combined water levels were very correlated with the dahiti and hydroweb datasets with r values larger than 0 8 and highly consistent with the observations from hydrological stations the inter year change range spanned from 0 015 m to 0 327 m and the intra year difference range varied from 0 03 m to 0 16 m and 4 integrating the gedi and icesat 2 missions allowed us to capture the monthly seasonal and annual dynamics of the lake water level and the results indicate that the combined dataset presents a valuable resource for hydrological and climatic change studies keywords gedi laser altimetry icesat 2 atl13 qinghai lake water level dynamics climate change data availability the gedi and icesat 2 data that support the findings of this study are available in earthdata search nasa gov the other two lake level public datasets were derived from the following resources available in the public domain https hydroweb theia land fr hydroweb and https dahiti dgfi tum de en 1 introduction water level fluctuations in endorheic lakes are sensitive to complex changes in regional precipitation evapotranspiration and glacier melting frappart et al 2018 kropáček et al 2012 talebmorad et al 2020 thus the dynamics of inland lakes are not only significant parameters for understanding the water balance in interior drainage basins but are also valuable indicators of climate change the tibetan plateau tp has the greatest number of high elevation inland lakes in the world and qinghai lake possesses the largest area among them in addition this lake is located in a typical area that is sensitive to climatic change and ecologically fragile wang et al 2019 javadinejad et al 2019 therefore case studies of qinghai lake s water level changes are very important and valuable however due to the harsh natural physiographic and climatic conditions in this region it is difficult to conduct field measurements over tp lakes even if some are accessible continually performing measurements and maintaining in situ gauges are costly endeavors luo et al 2021 fortunately the global ecosystem dynamics investigation gedi mission can provide multitrack and high temporal resolution observations between the latitudes of 51 6 n and 51 6 s and the advanced icesat 2 that is the follow up mission of the ice cloud and land elevation satellite icesat altimetry can also acquire unprecedented measurements of earth s surface these satellite missions have thus brought great prospects for lake level change monitoring in recent decades satellite altimetry including radar and laser altimetry has been extensively applied to water level retrievals of inland water bodies lakes rivers and reservoirs talebmorad and ostad ali askari 2022 busker et al 2019 crétaux et al 2011 velpuri et al 2012 initially radar altimeters were developed to monitor sea and ocean surface topography because of their ability to provide precise water surface elevations over large water bodies all weather operability and global data coverage radar altimeter missions such as geosat ers 1 2 topex poseidon envisat jason 1 2 3 cryosat 2 and sentinel 3 a and b are being used increasingly often for monitoring and evaluating water surface height levels of inland water bodies birkett and beckley 2010 calmant et al 2008 kleinherenbrink et al 2014 ghashghaie et al 2022 however the accuracy of such measurements can be affected by the extents of individual water bodies and by the retracking methods applied to returned waveforms guo et al 2009 wang et al 2019 compared to radar altimeters laser altimeters have smaller footprints and higher sampling densities making them more suitable for small water body observations many previous studies have investigated lake level changes over the tp using the geoscience laser altimeter system glas carried by icesat with decimeter accuracy zhang et al 2011 analyzed the lake level variations of qinghai lake and identified a mean increasing rate of 0 11 m yr from 2003 2009 phan et al 2012 found an average change rate of 0 20 m yr for 154 lakes larger than 1 km2 moreover by investigating the water levels of 105 closed lakes song et al 2014 found that seasonal lake level variations featured strong spatial and temporal heterogeneities icesat 2 was launched in september 2018 and equipped with the advanced topographic laser system atlas which is capable of detecting sensitivities at the photon level tian and shan 2021 the atlas instrument illuminates the earth s surface with six ground tracks simultaneously laser footprints are typically approximately 14 m in diameter and the distance between two footprints along the track is only 0 7 m compared with glas atlas can produce data at a much higher spatial resolution and denser sampling frequency zhang et al 2019 found that icesat 2 data contained nearly twice the lake coverage of tp lakes compared with icesat data and also had a higher altimetric accuracy the elevation difference was 2 cm at lake qinghai when compared to gauge data yuan et al 2020 evaluated the altimetric precision of icesat 2 atl13 data using gauge data collected from 30 reservoirs and extensively studied large lakes larger than 10 km2 in china their work showed that the icesat 2 mission greatly updated its altimetric capability and the relative altimetric error was 0 06 m while some mountainous and shallow lakes tended to have relatively large uncertainties dandabathula and rao 2020 validated the atl13 products with 46 observations consisting of near real time gauged data of 15 reservoirs and found that the maximum uncertainty observed was at the centimeter level the gedi launched on december 5th 2018 started collecting scientific data in operational mode on march 25th 2019 after a three month on orbit checkout it was attached to the international space station and collected data globally between latitudes of 51 6 n and 51 6 s the instrument can measure forest canopy heights canopy vertical structures and surface elevations to characterize important carbon and water cycling processes biodiversity and habitats adam et al 2020 fayad et al 2020 analyzed the quality of gedi data over 8 lakes in switzerland and found that the bias between gedi elevations and in situ data ranged from 13 8 cm to 9 8 cm xiang et al 2021 validated and compared the gedi icesat and icesat 2 data using in situ data from 22 gauging stations over the great lakes and lower mississippi river and reported that the root mean square errors of the three missions were 0 28 m 0 10 m and 0 06 m respectively with the goal of combining multiple altimeters for retrieving long term lake level series wang et al 2019 constructed the topex poseidon family altimeter dataset from october 1992 to december 2017 resulting in accuracies of 17 cm for topex poseidon and 10 cm for jason 1 2 3 over ngangzi co using cryosat 2 jason 2 3 and sentinel 3a data chen and liao 2020 determined that the level of qinghai lake had an increase rate of 0 443 m yr from 2016 to 2019 when analyzing lake level changes in the middle and lower yangtze river basin using the long term 2002 2017 observations of icesat envisat and cryosat 2 the authors found that there was a significant correlation between the satellite altimetry water levels and measured water levels with r values between 0 908 and 0 989 p 0 001 li et al 2020 by integrating icesat icesat 2 data the global surface water dataset and the hydrolakes dataset luo et al 2021 proposed plateau scale research of lake level changes over the tp from 2003 to 2019 they reported 242 lakes with areas greater than 1 km2 that could be observed by combining icesat and icesat 2 data and the mean water level change rate of these lakes was 0 20 0 04 m yr frappart et al 2021 provided a comprehensive evaluation of the performances of the previous radar and lidar altimetry missions according to their acquisition in mountainous areas and revealed that very accurate results could also be obtained using icesat 2 data however more contrasting results were obtained when using gedi in a relatively short period xu et al 2022 revealed the seasonal trends and cycles of lake level variations over the tp by combining icesat icesat 2 sentinel 3a 3b and cryosat 2 data demonstrating that qinghai lake rose at a rate of 0 17 0 001 m yr from 2003 to 2020 in general in the past two decades the number of in situ hydrological stations in the world has declined lawford et al 2013 satellite altimetry is becoming an important tool for monitoring lake surface heights however lake surface level dynamic monitoring still faces many difficulties such as large altimetric errors due to mixed signals contaminated by the surrounding lands large spatial gaps between tracks and temporal gaps that impede detailed variation descriptions to date the application and validation capacities of icesat 2 and gedi data over inland waters are very limited as only 3 years of icesat 2 data and 2 years of gedi were accumulated at the time of their respective product releases in particular contradictory results have been obtained when applying gedi data to study mountainous lakes as icesat 2 and gedi are operating simultaneously combining these two missions can provide a mutual accuracy verification and increase the temporal density of observations allowing us to cope with temporal gaps in data more analyses are necessary to determine the potential of using these missions to retrieve water levels therefore the objectives of this paper are 1 to provide a robust strategy to delete outliers generate accurate lake water levels from individual missions and analyze various factors that influence the accuracy of inland water level measurements derived from the gedi laser altimetry platform 2 to evaluate the performance of the combination of gedi and icesat 2 data in retrieving inland water dynamics and 3 to track the latest dynamic water levels of qinghai lake this paper is divided into five sections a description of the altimetry datasets obtained for the studied lake and a detailed water level extraction method are provided in section 2 the individual water level results retrieved from both products and comparisons and validations of these data with the hydrostation data and two other public datasets are given in section 3 followed by a discussion in section 4 in the last section the main conclusions are presented 2 data and methods 2 1 altimetric data in qinghai lake the latitude and longitude ranges of qinghai lake are 36 32 n 37 15 n and 99 36 e 100 47 e respectively as the largest inland lake in china it is located on the northeast edge of the qinghai tibet plateau located within the transition zone among the qinghai tibet alpine region the loess plateau and the northwest arid region it is an ideal place to study climate responses water balances and hydrological processes zhao et al 2017 in this study we utilized the level 2a gedi product containing ground elevation canopy top height and relative return energy metrics derived from geolocated waveforms the height data are based on the wgs 84 ellipsoid and the inland surface water product atl13 of icesat 2 providing the along track orthometric heights of lakes rivers and wetlands with reference to the earth gravitational model 2008 egm2008 was obtained when the first draft of this article was written gedi data from 25 april 2019 to 3 august 2021 and icesat 2 data from 31 october 2018 to 3 july 2021 were available https search earthdata nasa gov among the current available data products the higher quality v002 version of the gedi product and v004 version of the icesat 2 product were adopted the total available number of days in the gedi and icesat 2 datasets are 92 days and 76 days respectively table 1 among them the highest observation frequency is 11 days in august 2020 while the observations frequencies of most months are 4 10 days the specific laser footprints of the two missions were distributed over qinghai lake as shown in fig 2 2 1 1 gedi l2a the gedi instrument consists of 3 lasers producing a total of 8 ground transect beams spaced approximately 600 m apart on the earth s surface in the cross track direction relative to the flight direction each beam transect consists of 30 m footprint samples spaced approximately every 60 m along the track the coverage laser is split into two transects that are then each dithered in total producing four ground transects the other two full power lasers are dithered producing two ground transects each the configuration of the ground tracks is shown in fig 1 a hofton et al 2019 the instrument is a full waveform lidar instrument that captures the shapes of the transmitted and reflected laser waveforms in real time it enables a precise range to the reflecting surface to be calculated for every shot over flat terrain e g plains or water surfaces the shape of the received waveform looks similar to that of the transmitted pulse however photons may be reflected from multiple surfaces within the footprint over complex e g stepped or sloped terrain resulting in a received waveform with multiple modes fayad et al 2021 the interpretation of these laser pulses in postprocessing affects the accuracy of the surface elevation vegetation structure relative canopy height results etc as mentioned in the algorithm theoretical basis document the l1b product is issued by six configurations of algorithms a1 to a6 each representing different thresholds and smoothing settings hofton et al 2019 correspondingly the l2a geolocated elevation and height products inherit the results of these multiple algorithm settings the n in the parameter elev lowestmode an represents the specific algorithm the position of the ground return within a waveform is determined using the position of the last detected peak which is dependent on the width of the second gaussian filter smoothwidth zcross the widths of algorithm 1 and 4 were fixed to 6 5 ns and the widths of the remaining algorithms 2 3 5 and 6 were set to 3 5 ns fayad et al 2020 therefore the six algorithms could be divided into two groups in our study only algorithm 1 a1 and algorithm 2 a2 which can represent each group were tested moreover gedi uses its own global positioning system inertial measurement unit and information from three star trackers that permit its plane positioning accuracy to remain within 10 m 1 σ dubayah et al 2020 the product contains a preliminary set of quality flags and metrics that can be used to filter shots with poor geolocation performances waveforms of bad signal quality and waveforms affected by clouds or other land surface conditions roy et al 2021 thus the quanlity flag an flag and num detectedmodes an metric were adopted in our study to obtain accurate water level retrievals 2 1 2 icesat 2 atl13 icesat 2 is placed at a 500 km altitude in a 92 inclination sun synchronous orbit with a 91 day repeat cycle and an equatorial ground track spacing of approximately 28 8 km the atlas instrument operates at a higher repetition rate thus improving the along track spatial resolution icesat 2 products are organized by ground track with ground tracks 1l and 1r forming pair one ground tracks 2l and 2r forming pair two and ground tracks 3l and 3r forming pair three the distance between the left and right beams of each pair is 90 m pair tracks are approximately 3 km and 2 5 km apart in the across track and along track directions respectively fig 1 b roy et al 2021 the beams within each pair have different transmit energies so called weak and strong beams with an energy ratio between them of approximately 1 4 the relative position of the strong and weak beams on the ground depends on the orientation of the icesat 2 observatory which changes approximately twice per year to maximize solar illumination neumann et al 2020 numerous subproducts generated from the level 2 master product called atl03 are available to the public through the national snow and ice data center one of these products namely atl13 provides along track and near shore water surface height distributions within the water masks along with the mean standard deviation and slope of each beam as well as statistics jasinski et al 2019 the water surface heights offer geodetic heights above the wgs 84 ellipsoid itrf2014 reference frame and orthometric heights based on the earth gravitational model 2008 egm2008 geoid 2 1 3 auxiliary data in this study the boundary of qinghai lake was determined from its year 2018 vector format file shapefile which was downloaded from the national basic geographic information centre http ngcc sbsm gov cn the lake boundary was then used to extract elevation footprints to unify the vertical data of icesat 2 and gedi we used the egm2008 model to convert the gedi heights based on wgs84 to heights based on egm2008 the conversion software tools of the emg2008 geoid model can be downloaded from the geographiclib htttps geographiclib sourceforge io html geoid html in addition to verify the integrated water level results the available in situ gauge data of xiashe station from 2018 to 2021 were collected from the qinghai water conservancy information network https slt qinghai gov cn subject cid 24 time series products from two other public databases were obtained to derive lake levels from multiple radar altimeters designed for inland water bodies and these lake levels were used for comparison the hydrological time series of inland waters dahiti is maintained by the deutsches geodätisches forschungsinstitut schwatke et al 2015 and the hydroweb database is constructed by the laboratoire d etudes en géophysique et océanographie spatiales yue et al 2021 the elevation reference data were the ggm02c and eigen 6c4 gravity field models 2 2 water level extraction fig 3 depicts the processing steps in the proposed method first the laser footprints over qinghai lake were roughly extracted using the lake boundary then the outlier deletion of each mission was implemented subsequently the water level at each track was extracted and the corresponding accuracy assessment was conducted the effective tracks were then used as the inputs on specific dates and the final heights of each mission were estimated by calculating averages to evaluate the lake level accuracies of the two missions the standard deviation was selected to assess the single track and mean lake levels of each individual day derived from the effective tracks before integration the bias between the two missions was adjusted using data from the overlapping or adjacent dates finally the long time series lake levels and corresponding accuracies were constructed and validated using the in situ data and the dahiti and hydroweb datasets 2 2 1 outlier detection due to the effects of atmospheric conditions and clouds not all altimetric observations are effective hui et al 2016 therefore outliers should be removed before estimating the mean lake levels for example the height distributions of 8 gedi beams on 12 sep 2019 fig 4 a and 6 icesat 2 tracks on 7 sep 2019 fig 4 b illustrate that the height differences among different gedi beams are larger than the differences among icesat 2 tracks and the gedi data contain many extreme outliers while the icesat 2 data have small differences among different tracks and few extreme outliers thus in this study a combination of criteria was applied to remove outliers according to their characteristics for gedi l2a in the first step the quality flag quality flag an and mode number flag num detectedmode an contained in the products were used a quality flag an term the value equal to 1 indicates that the waveforms met the energy sensitivity amplitude and real time surface tracking quality criteria then the num detectedmode an flag value of 1 was selected to guarantee that the waveform returned from the lake surface second the estimation of the elevation bin with 1 interval was implemented a step size of 1 m was used to address the water surface slopes associated with various causes the lake water heights within the maximum bin that possess the highest frequency were preserved the rest outside the 1 m interval from the maximum bin were discarded as outliers third the mean water level was calculated based on the remaining heights and the root mean square rms values of the residuals between the heights and the mean water level were estimated the values were considered outliers if the absolute differences between the observations and the mean water level were greater than the 3 rms criterion finally even if a single beam met the above requirements if the differences among different beams on the same day were larger than 1 m the mean value of the beams of the specific day was removed due to the large uncertainty for icesat 2 atl13 the interquartile range iqr was adopted the height outliers were defined using eqs 1 and 2 then the 3 rms criterion was applied in case the first step did not work well eqs 1 and 2 are expressed as follows 1 iqr q 3 q 1 2 h outlier q 1 1 5 i q r h outlier q 3 1 5 i q r where q 1 is the first quartile q 3 is the third quartile and h outlier is the abnormal height 2 2 2 inter mission bias adjustment it is very important to adjust the biases between different missions before combining multi mission data and constructing time series records absolute calibration using tide gauge data is the most common method schwatke et al 2015 to avoid interference with altimetric signals the fixed stations should be far enough from land and small enough such that the site does not impede the altimeter response otherwise the method may be unusable when measured data at fixed sites are lacking in addition two other methods crossover analysis and collinear analysis have also been employed to adjust the inter satellite bias for global and regional studies bosch et al 2014 however in situ gauge stations and simultaneous crossover points are not available for most lakes so these two methods were not options in this study in this paper a simple relative calibration method was employed to estimate the bias between the gedi and icesat 2 datasets assuming that the surface of a lake is a flat plane the lake levels observed by mission a should ideally be equal to those simultaneously measured by mission b however because of the existence of bias and noises such as waves and seiches these differences are not equal zero in reality and are calculated as follows 3 δ i h i a h i b where i 1 2 k represents the number of pair samples in the overlapping period of the two missions δ i is the difference between the pair samples and h i a and h i b are the water levels observed by gedi and icesat 2 respectively generally two missions do not overfly the same lake in the same epoch therefore to ensure that there are enough pair samples to accurately estimate the bias we broadly selected the data taken on the same or adjacent days for the bias adjustment process because interpolation among adjacent days might introduce interpolation errors when calculating the differences we assumed that the lake level would not change suddenly among most adjacent dates thus in our study we did not consider interpolation effect in addition xiang et al 2021 compared water level retrievals from icesat 2 and gedi as well as icesat 1 and validated them against in situ data from 22 gauging stations at various scales in the great lakes the results showed that icesat 2 can provide lake water level retrievals with an unprecedented accuracy rmse 0 06 m biases 0 01 0 05 m thus if the differences between the pair samples are larger than 1 m the observation result of icesat 2 is taken as the water level of that day and the gedi observation results are discarded as abnormal values supposing the remaining differences obey a normal distribution the biases can be estimated from these differences using the maximum likelihood estimation method 2 2 3 accuracy assessment and validation altimetric errors can be quantitatively calculated when gauge water levels are available however gauge data are not accessible from most lakes in high elevation areas therefore in this study the standard deviation sd of the mean water level height was taken as an indicator of the altimetric uncertainty to present the measurement error of the estimated water levels considering that the final lake water level was calculated from multi beam observations taken over the water surface the final lake water level would be precise if the measurement uncertainty was low to validate the accuracy of the water level extraction results the monthly and yearly changes of the available in situ gauge data of xiashe station dahiti and hydroweb database were compared and the differences were analyzed 3 results and analysis after outliers were removed the water levels of qinghai lake from october 2018 to august 2021 were derived from the two missions since no in situ gauge data of each gedi observation day were available for absolute validation icesat 2 data were employed as the benchmark for the following validation and calibration of lake levels resulting from the gedi mission first the processing algorithm acquisition time and beam intensity of the gedi data that may have affected the water levels were discussed and quantitatively analyzed then the biases between the two missions were adjusted and long time series monthly lake level time series were constructed 3 1 lake levels retrieved by icesat 2 fig 5 displays the water level dynamics and sds retrieved from each icesat 2 observation the lowest water level of 3196 87 m occurred on 3 dec 2018 and the highest water level of 3197 99 m occurred on 2 oct 2020 in 2019 the water levels presented an increase from january until august when the lake reached its maximum water level and then declined in september before increasing again in october and november and finally declining in december a similar trend occurred in 2020 generally the water level of qinghai lake has increased over the last three years the sds of most days were under 0 05 m and the mean sd of all observations was 0 03 m therefore the water levels of icesat 2 could be taken as the benchmark to evaluate the gedi observation results 3 2 lake levels retrieved by gedi 3 2 1 algorithm 1 versus algorithm 2 after removing the outliers we found 59 days and 68 days effectively measured via algorithm a1 and a2 with effective rates of 64 13 and 73 91 of the total 92 gedi days respectively in the common 59 days obtained by both algorithms the differences of the retrieved water levels between algorithm 1 and algorithm 2 were extremely small with a mean value of approximately 1 cm fig 6 meaning that there were basically no differences between the lake water level retrieval results the mean sds of the corresponding retrieval results were 0 09 m and 0 12 m respectively among the effective days obtained using algorithm 1 and algorithm 2 the numbers of days on which all 8 beams collected valid data were 30 days and 50 days accounting for 50 84 and 73 53 of the total respectively since there is no significant difference between the water level inversion results and accuracy and the algorithm 2 has more effective data in this paper we selected the results of algorithm 2 for the following analysis 3 2 2 daytime observation versus nighttime observation the results from algorithm a2 were grouped by time the temporal range from 8 00 to 20 00 was considered daytime and the rest of the 24 hour cycle was considered nighttime fig 7 shows the sd comparison of the gedi daytime and nighttime observations the results showed that the sds varied from 0 018 m to 0 312 m for the 38 days acquired in the daytime with a mean sd of 0 115 m for the 30 days acquired in the nighttime the sds spanned from 0 019 m to 0 295 m with a mean of 0 110 m overall from the perspective of the average error the influence of the observation time on water levels showed little difference between daytime and nighttime 3 2 3 coverage beams versus full power beams to examine the influence of the beam strength on the accuracy of the water level observations the sds of different beams were analyzed the mean water levels were computed from the coverage beams beam 0000 beam 0001 beam 0010 and beam 0011 were marked 1 2 3 and 4 in turn and full power beams beam 0101 beam 0110 beam 1000 and beam 1011 were abbreviated as 5 6 7 and 8 in turn among the 68 days considered the numbers of lacking data days were 11 days for the coverage beams and 2 days for the full power beams fig 8 shows the sd comparison of the coverage beams and full power beams showing that the sds of the coverage beams were generally larger than those of the full power beams the average sds of the coverage beam and full power beam results were 0 116 m and 0 100 m respectively the number of days with full power beam observations and the corresponding sds revealed that the strong beams obtained more effective observations and had higher accuracies than the weak beams furthermore fig 9 illustrates the differences between each gedi beam and icesat 2 track that were observed with the same or adjacent dates the specific mean differences between each beam and the icesat 2 results were 0 104 m 0 054 m 0 212 m 0 214 m 0 260 m 0 293 m 0 170 m and 0 109 m as a result systematic differences were identified among the different beams and the largest biases occurred in beams 3 4 5 and 6 followed by beams 7 and 8 beams 1 and 2 had the smallest biases 3 3 bias adjustment between gedi and icesat 2 twenty two paired samples were found in the overlapping observations obtained on the same or adjacent days between the gedi and icesat 2 datasets from table 2 it can be seen that there were 4 days with same date observations and the intervals between the remaining instances were 1 5 days fig 10 visually displays the differences between the gedi and icesat 2 datasets the red dots are outliers that should be removed before estimating the mean bias the mean bias and sd are represented by the green and red dashed lines respectively compared to icesat 2 the negative difference of 4 days means that these gedi underestimated the lake levels on these observation days the rest are all positive meaning that most gedi observations reflected overestimated water levels there were 3 days on which the differences were larger than 1 m october 6 and december 1 in 2019 and june 26 in 2020 on which significant differences of 1 704 m 1 449 m and 1 663 m respectively were observed according to the bias adjustment principle discussed above the corresponding gedi observed values were deleted as abnormal records and the icesat 2 observed values were thus kept as the water levels of the corresponding days the mean bias of the remaining 19 days was 0 264 0 357 m revealing that gedi overestimated the water levels therefore the adjusted gedi lake levels were calculated by subtracting the mean bias from the original values 3 4 obtaining and validating long time series lake levels by integrating gedi and icesat 2 datasets fig 11 illustrates the integrated lake water level dynamics the red crosses mark the adjusted gedi results and their corresponding sds for the specifically acquired days spanning from october 2018 to july 2021 it can be seen that the combined dataset significantly densified the monitoring time compared to each mission alone from the water level of an individual day except for several relatively high adjusted water level days retrieved by gedi the overall days constituting the relatively high water level periods were distributed mostly in august and september followed by october and november while the days constituting relatively low water level periods were distributed mostly in february and march overall the water levels showed upward trends assuming that the yearly water levels in 2018 and 2021 could be roughly expressed with observed months the annual average water levels for 2018 2019 2020 and 2021 were 3197 019 m 3197 252 m 3197 607 m and 3197 748 m respectively compared to each previous year the yearly increases were 0 233 m 0 355 m and 0 141 m the reference average annual growth value from 2018 to 2021 was 0 243 m yr which should represent an underestimation of the yearly increasing rate due to the lack of data on the higher level 2021 season the corresponding annual average water level data from the xiashe water level station showed water levels of 3195 41 m 3195 97 m 3196 34 m and 3196 51 m showing increases of 0 56 m 0 37 m and 0 17 m compared to each previous year the corresponding average annual increase was 0 367 m yr overall from the perspective of inter annual changes it can be seen that the water level of qinghai lake showed an upward trend over the four years of study to further evaluate the validity of our integrated results we used monitoring data from the dahiti and hydroweb databases the water levels and the uncertainty of each individual day are shown in fig 12 for the inter year changes from 2018 to 2021 the increases in dahiti were 0 539 0 318 m and 0 146 m with a mean rate of 0 334 m yr and those in hydroweb were 0 416 m 0 444 m and 0 216 m with a mean rate of 0 359 m yr to compare the three datasets the days with same day observations or with an interval of two adjacent days were selected from fig 13 a it can be seen that our combined results acquired more data in a relatively short period and their water levels all presented upward trends from 2018 to 2021 the subfigure in the bottom right hand corner displayed the change trend of the common eight days among these three datasets demonstrating their good consistency fig 13 b and c further illustrate the correlations r values between our results and the other two datasets the overlapping days in the dahiti and hydroweb datasets were 41 and 17 respectively and the r values of both exceeded 0 8 indicating the validity of our monitoring results fig 14 further compares and analyses the inter annual and intra annual differences among the four data sources compared to the xiashe station fig 14 a the differences between our results the dahiti dataset and the hydroweb dataset and the gauge data were 0 33 m 0 02 m and 0 14 m respectively from 2018 to 2019 the large difference between our results and the water station data from 2018 to 2019 may have been caused by the lack of data in the first three seasons of 2018 however the corresponding differences were 0 02 m 0 06 m and 0 08 m respectively from 2019 to 2020 indicating that our retrieved results were more consistent with the gauging station data in this period the differences for 2020 to 2021 were 0 06 m 0 02 m and 0 05 m respectively the relatively small difference increase can be attributed to the limited data in 2021 because 2019 and 2020 have complete whole year observation data we compared only the intra year changes during these two years fig 14 b for 2019 the water levels revealed by our integrated results at the beginning and end of 2019 were 3196 972 m and 3197 319 m respectively with an increase of 0 347 m throughout the year the corresponding levels from xiashe station were 3195 71 m and 3196 09 m respectively and the water level rose by 0 38 m the difference was 0 03 m indicating that the integrated water levels were highly consistent with those measured at the hydrometric station the increases in the dahiti and hydroweb data were 0 364 m and 0 500 m with differences from the xiashe station data of 0 02 m and 0 12 m respectively in 2020 the yearly increases in our results the xiashe station data the dahiti dataset and the hydroweb dataset were 0 163 m 0 32 m 0 376 m and 0 550 m respectively the differences between the three datasets and the xiashe station data were 0 16 m 0 06 m and 0 23 m respectively obviously the increase from the beginning to the end of each year was relatively small in our results which may have been affected by the fact that most of the dates used to retrieve the average water level in january came from gedi table 1 which overestimated the early season water levels fig 15 shows the monthly average water levels from the intra annual changes in 2019 it can be seen that the lake water levels in january and february were relatively high before declining in march and subsequently gradually increasing from april to october compared to the may and july levels there was a downward fluctuation throughout june and august before the water level again reached higher levels in september and october finally in winter november and december the water level dropped again the year 2020 presented similar characteristics and trends relatively low water levels occurred in february and march while higher water levels occurred in august september and october however there was an upward trend from february to april and a downward trend from may to july in 2021 on this basis we also calculated statistics on seasonal changes from october to december the average water levels each year from 2018 to 2020 were 3197 019 m 3197 598 m and 3197 799 m exhibiting increase rates of 0 580 m yr and 0 202 m yr respectively the increase rates in the first three quarters of each year from 2019 to 2020 were 0 423 m yr 0 491 m yr and 0 602 m yr compared to 2020 the increase rates in the first two quarters of the 2021 year were 0 342 m yr and 0 140 m yr the corresponding monthly seasonal and annual variations in the dahiti and hydroweb datasets were also analyzed fig 16 comparing the 2019 and 2020 data in fig 15 with those in fig 16 our results presented the variations within all months of the year however the dahiti product lacked data for one month in 2020 and the hydroweb dataset lacked records for half a year in 2019 and for one month in 2020 indicating that combining the icesat 2 and gedi datasets can reflect more detailed temporal changes excluding elevation deviations due to the instrument biases of altimeters and geoid differences it can be seen that the water levels of both datasets reflected rising trends over the last four years relatively high water level occurred in september and october while low water levels occurred in february and march these trends were consistent with our research results however obvious subseasonal differences occurred among the datasets for example in 2019 our data showed a downward trend from january to april where an upward trend could be observed in both the dahiti and hydroweb datasets a similar difference occurred in 2021 when our results indicated an increase from january to march while the dahiti and hydroweb datasets indicated decreases comparing to the results obtained for the month of april neither of the two other datasets showed any large increase in may however our results showed a decline of approximately 0 265 m 4 discussion when retrieving lake levels whether directly using satellite altimetric data or integrating other remote sensing data the key is to accurately extract the effective footprints over lakes and evaluate the accuracies of both the original data and extracted results in this paper we combined data from two newly launched laser altimetry missions gedi and icesat 2 to monitor lake water level dynamics over the tibetan plateau area specifically taking qinghai lake as an example we obtained the daily monthly seasonal and yearly lake level variations from 2018 to 2021 from the gedi l2a data product and icesat 2 atl13 product from the above results two aspects could be further investigated in future research first the accuracy of the current results should be improved as discussed in part 4 1 second the results and the factors that potentially caused the observed lake level changes should be linked as described in part 4 2 4 1 factors affecting the lake level extraction accuracy the sds of the gedi data ranged from 0 018 m to 0 312 m with an average of 0 109 m fig 11 because gedi overestimated the water levels even after the bias adjustment the gedi s overall water levels were relatively high and the sds were larger than those of icesat 2 for example the maximum gedi measured water level of 3198 365 m occurred on september 13 2020 and the maximum sd of 0 312 m occurred on march 29 2021 for the integrated total of 126 days the sds spanned from 0 005 m to 0 312 m with an average of 0 061 m for most dates the sds were below 0 20 m the specific dynamics of the individual days and uncertainties in the dahiti and hydroweb datasets are shown in fig 12 fig 12 a indicates that the dahiti dataset had dense data and a high precision the uncertainty in this dataset ranged from 0 001 m to 0 095 m with a mean value of 0 008 m hydroweb presented relatively sparse data fig 12 b with relatively large uncertainties in 2018 and the first half of 2019 with the whole uncertainty range spanning from 0 017 m to 0 260 m with a mean of 0 113 m compared to the results obtained from dahiti the accuracy of our integrated results still needed to be further improved in addition our results and methodology were compared to the recent results and approaches of yuan et al 2020 and fayad et al 2020 who evaluated the performances of the icesat 2 and gedi datasets respectively with in situ data compared to their work we performed a more rigorous method to remove outliers in addition the iqr 3 sigma criterion and quality flags were also adopted to derive more accurate water levels with an average sd of 0 03 m for icesat 2 and an average sd of 0 109 m for gedi the relative altimetric error and uncertainty of icesat 2 were reported to be 0 06 m and 0 02 m respectively yuan et al 2020 and in fayad et al 2020 the biases between the gedi elevations and in situ data of eight studied lakes ranged from 13 8 cm to 9 8 cm with the sds of the mean differences ranging from 14 5 to 31 6 cm by comparison it can be seen that our strict method improved the accuracy of the water level inversion results even so in our results some abnormal water levels and several relatively large differences occurred between the two missions table 2 illustrating that although tailored criteria were taken some water levels from the gedi still could not represent the real water levels which may have been caused by the data product quality beck et al 2020 annual lake area changes may have also affected the screening of laser footprints over the lake therefore for the next step the lake area variations were considered using annual high resolution optical images in addition when the satellites had off pointing angles the plane position deviation would also affect the laser altimetry accuracy assume that the orbit height of the satellite is approximately h 400 km the laser pointing angle is with the measurement error δ and the terrain slope is s the elevation error δ h caused by the satellite pointing angle and terrain surface fluctuations can be approximately expressed using eq 4 gardner 1992 4 δ h h δ tan s when the off nadir pointing angle is equal to 6 with a 1 measurement error assuming a water slope s of 0 the elevation error δh is equal to 0 204 m more elevation errors simulated under different conditions are listed in table 3 when the slope and pointing measurement error were constant the pointing angle seriously affected the elevation accuracy to ensure the accuracy of the water surface elevation measurements data taken at small pointing angles should be selected in future studies similarly the error in the atl13 product may have been inherited from atl03 which primarily contained geolocated ellipsoidal heights for each time tagged photon event downlinked from the atlas sensor residual errors in the water height backscatter model and related algorithms may still influence the accuracies of these values due to specular backscattered lambertian backscattered and solar lambertian backscattered light from the water surface 4 2 factors driving lake water level variations our results revealed that the lake level of qinghai lake increased by an average annual of approximately 0 24 m yr from 2018 to 2021 this finding is consistent with the trends demonstrated by the latest studies chen and liao 2020 xu et al 2022 among them the largest annual increment of 0 56 m occurred in 2019 fig 13 a this increase can be mainly attributed to abnormally high annual precipitation 457 3 mm over the qinghai lake basin in this year the qinghai meteorological bureau also reported that 2019 was defined as an abnormal wet year leading to the continuously increasing runoff of all rivers in the basin and causing the water level of qinghai lake to continue to rise fig 17 shows the precipitation changes at buha station the buha river is the longest and largest river in the basin contributing almost half of the total runoff to the lake zhang et al 2011 in the study area precipitation months are mainly concentrated from july to september further explaining why the relatively high water levels occur mostly in august and september many previous studies have also revealed that over the past half century the water level of qinghai lake presented increasing variations a rapid increase in the lake area was observed from 2005 to 2016 caused by increased river runoff due to glacier ablation and precipitation tang et al 2018 fang et al 2019 demonstrated that the major cause of water level changes 93 13 was the combined effect of precipitation and evaporation during the 1960 2016 period while catchment modifications induced by human activities were very limited during this period 6 87 using a meteorological dataset collected from 1991 to 2017 chen et al 2022 indicated that precipitation has the greatest impact on the water volume variations of qinghai lake followed by the accumulated temperature and evaporation fan et al 2021 investigated the abnormal changes from 1970 to 2018 and revealed that the rapid water level recovery observed in recent years can be attributed to the substantial increases in several key abnormal wet years such as 2005 2012 2015 2017 and 2018 the lake level variations coincide with annual precipitation rather than temperature or evaporation however seasonal variations in lake levels and the spatial trend patterns differ considerably among different parts of the whole tp and the factors driving lake distribution dynamics are still under debate phan et al 2013 one viewpoint supports that increasing precipitation was the primary driver behind the rapid expansion of the lake and permafrost degradation may have contributed a significant amount of water to accelerate the continuous lake expansion in the endorheic basin in recent years liu et al 2021 pang et al 2021 showed that the rapid increase in the water volumes of closed lakes over different subzones of the tp could be used to partly explain the observed spatial and temporal heterogeneities of precipitation and temperature therefore in further studies the use of additional available data such as direct precipitation snow melt glacial melt moisture condition evaporation and rainwater runoff data would promote our further understanding of the driving factors of lake dynamics and global climate change over the tp 5 conclusion obtaining accurate lake level fluctuations is necessary for solving the high uncertainties regarding the water balance of the tibetan plateau basin lakes located in this region are surrounded by high elevation rough terrain the surface environment of which varies seasonally and it is more difficult to measure the dynamics of these lakes than of lakes elsewhere new altimetry satellites provide a solution for monitoring water level changes in areas without in situ gauging data in this study the recent water level dynamics of lake qinghai are examined by integrating refined icesat 2 and gedi data a tailored scheme is implemented to refine the raw data products first and then the factors that affected the accuracy of the gedi data were analyzed the icesat 2 laser altimetry data exhibit a strong capability for monitoring the lake level with a very high accuracy the gedi dataset has a dense temporal advantage and can monitor the lake level for a maximum of 8 days in a month though the accuracy of these data is inferior to that of the icesat 2 data and large differences exist among different beams most of which overestimated the water levels by 0 264 0 357 m the availability of the gedi algorithm 2 footprints was higher than that of the algorithm 1 footprints and beams 1 and 2 were recommended for further application compared to the results obtained from the dahiti dataset the accuracy of our integrated results still needs to be further improved and the factors affecting the accuracy extraction such as the slant angle and pointing measurement error of the gedi data need to be further investigated our integrated results the in situ measurements the dahiti dataset and the hydroweb dataset demonstrate increase rates ranging from 0 243 to 0 367 m yr during the 2018 to 2021 period the relatively high water level periods are distributed mostly in august and september followed by in october and november while the lower water level periods are distributed mostly in february and march the main driving factor inducing high water levels was surging annual precipitation especially in 2019 the inter year and intra year comparisons between the above four sources showed that the validation of our results and the intra year changes in 2019 with relatively rich observation data over all 12 months were strongly consistent with the in situ lake level measurements with a difference of 0 03 m this finding confirms that the constructed long time series lake level dataset allows us to capture the monthly seasonal and annual cycles of lake level variations and can serve as a valuable tool for hydrological and climatic studies when hydrological station measured data are lacking comprehensive examinations of lake level changes will become possible once rich gedi and icesat 2 data become available in the next few years funding this research was funded by the open fund of state key laboratory of remote sensing

2378,the mean transit time mtt of water is an essential descriptor of streamflow generation and catchment water storage research on how mtts fluctuate over time and the variables influencing such variation is limited in this study bi weekly stable isotopic data in precipitation and streamflow were used together with daily records of hydrometeorological information to investigate the temporal variability of streamflow mtts the data were collected over 8 years in a nested system of 8 tropical alpine catchments in the zhurucay ecohydrological observatory in southern ecuador 3 450 to 3 900 m a s l the temporal variability of streamflow mtts was estimated using yearly periods and a 1 month moving window i e 81 yearly calculated mtts per catchment the factors controlling the temporal variability of mtts were identified using simple and multiple linear regression models with hydrometeorological parameters as explanatory variables results reveal that streamflow mtts in all catchments were short 1 year and varied little among catchments 191 30 47 10 days a combination of hydrometeorological variables i e precipitation streamflow and runoff coefficient over antecedent periods up to 1 year was found to control mtt temporal variability overall these findings point to the prevalence of low temporal variability of hydrological conditions in the investigated catchments our study is key to provide insights into the factors controlling the temporal variability of streamflow mtt in tropical catchments overcoming data limitations of past investigations and with significant implications for improved water supply management keywords transit time stables isotopes tracer hydrology páramo temporal variability tropical montane data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction one of the most common catchment descriptors in hydrologic studies is the mean transit time mtt of streamflow mtt is defined as the mean age of water that enters a catchment during previous precipitation events at the time of exit at an outlet point i e streams springs soils mcguire mcdonnell 2006 this hydrological descriptor contains information about water storage and the flow paths that water follows in a catchment mcguire mcdonnell 2006 the mtt of stream water helps to better conceptualize the hydrological and biogrochemical processes of a catchment burns et al 2003 hence the mtt is a key hydrological parameter for risk assessment contaminant remediation land use change climate change and improved management of water resources landon et al 2000 nystrom 1985 turner et al 2006 mtt can be calculated by modeling the relationship between input and output signals of conservative tracers such as water stable isotopes 2h and 18o mcguire mcdonnell 2006 or chloride kirchner et al 2010 among the most common methods to estimate the mtt of water are the lumped convolution approach lca the fourier method and the sine save method benettin et al 2015 these methods take advantage of the damping of the isotopic composition of streamflow relative to the temporal variation of the isotopic composition of precipitation due to mixing processes the application of these methods could be difficult due to a range of uncertainties caused by the spatial and temporal variability of the isotopic composition of water the unavailability of long term tracer records and low sampling frequency due to financial and logistical constraints hrachowitz soulsby tetzlaff speed 2009 mcguire mcdonnell 2006 notwithstanding the study of mtt is crucial since it enables a better understanding of runoff generation processes and the hydrological behavior of a catchment several studies have focused on determining stream water mtt in a variety of environments worldwide in tropical e g farrick and branfireun 2015 jacobs et al 2018 mosquera et al 2016 muñoz villers et al 2016 timbe et al 2014 and non tropical e g hale et al 2016 hrachowitz et al 2009 lyon et al 2010 mcguire et al 2005 soulsby et al 2006 uchida and asano 2010 vitvar and balderer 1997 montane catchments those investigations were usually limited by the availability of short term tracer datasets ranging from one to a few years which did not allow identifying temporal changes in catchment hydrological function since mtts vary in time due to seasonal and annual changes in hydrometeorological conditions birkel et al 2015 hrachowitz et al 2009 ma yamanaka 2016 understanding those variations and their drivers is crucial to unraveling the change in hydrological behavior of a catchment to date most of the studies investigating the temporal variability of streamflow mtts have been conducted in temperate regions for example hrachowitz et al 2009 applied a moving window approach to estimate the variability of streamflow mtts over 8 years in two small catchments 1 km2 in the scottish highlands these authors found that the temporal variability in mtt was influenced by precipitation amount applying a similar approach over 10 years ma yamanaka 2016 investigated the temporal variation of mtt for five temperate catchments 268 2173 km2 in central japan differing in slope geology and soil type these authors reported that the estimated mtts were longer during drier periods than during wetter periods and were mainly controlled by geology another study was carried out in a boreal catchment in north sweden 0 47 km2 using a 10 year isotopic data record peralta tapia et al 2016 the authors determined a strong correlation between annual rainfall and mtts during snow free periods in another study conducted in 4 catchments in southeast australia 8 7 323 km2 using 3 years of data mtts were found to be correlated with runoff coefficient cartwright et al 2020 in a tropical setting birkel et al 2016 investigated the temporal variability of streamflow mtts in a humid forested catchment 30 km2 in costa rica these authors applied a lumped convolution model to a short term isotopic tracer dataset 2 years using a monthly moving window to estimate streamflow mtts over 4 month time spans even though this is to our best knowledge the only study to date that investigated the temporal variability of mtts in the tropics the reported mtts could present large uncertainties since estimated mtts were longer than the data records used for model calibration particularly during dry periods i e mtts varied between 5 and 12 months wind direction was reported as the most important meteorological variable influencing the temporal variability of mtts in this topical catchment considering the limited information on the temporal variability of mtts in tropical settings we aim to fill this knowledge gap by taking advantage of a unique long term tracer dataset in precipitation and streamflow collected over 8 years across a nested system of 8 tropical alpine páramo catchments in southern ecuador to this end the specific objectives of this study are 1 to estimate the temporal variability of mtts across a nested system of tropical alpine catchments and 2 to identify which hydrometeorological conditions control the temporal variability of mtts across the catchments if any 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study site is the zhurucay ecohydrological observatory zeo 3 4 s 79 14 w located on the western slopes of the andean mountain range in southern ecuador fig 1 the observatory has a drainage area of 7 53 km2 with an elevation ranging from 3 505 to 3 900 m a s l the zeo is located in a tropical alpine páramo ecosystem the local climate is primarily influenced by continental air masses stemming from the amazon basin which originate mainly in the atlantic ocean esquivel hernández et al 2019 zhiña et al in production annual precipitation is 1 345 mm at 3 780 m a s l precipitation shows low seasonality and is mainly composed of drizzle padrón et al 2015 according to these authors the wettest period lasts from march to may and the least wet period from august to october mean annual temperature is 6 c mean relative humidity is 93 6 córdova et al 2015 and solar radiation is 4 942 mj m 2 per year carrillo rojas et al 2019 at 3 780 m a s l annual actual evapotranspiration is 622 mm ochoa sánchez et al 2019 although the temporal varbility of mtts in the study region has not yet been investigated an analysis of the spatial variability of mtts at the study site was conducted previously mosquera et al 2016 this study showed that mtts varied between 4 and 9 months and that their spatial variability across the observatory was controlled by average slope the geomorphology of the study catchments is u shaped with an average slope of 17 as a result of glacial activity mosquera et al 2015 the geology is compacted and dominated by the quimsacocha and turi formations characterized by volcanic rock deposits compacted during the glacial activity of the last ice age coltorti ollier 2000 both formations date from the late miocene pratt et al 1997 lithology in the quimsacocha formation is composed of basaltic flows with plagioclases feldspars and andesitic pyroclasts whereas the turi formation is composed of tuffaceous andesitic breccias conglomerates and horizontally stratified sands hungerbühler et al 2002 the main soil types in zhurucay are classified as andosols and histosols iuss working group wrb 2015 formed by the accumulation of volcanic ash in combination with the humid cold climate conditions quichimbo et al 2012 these soils of volcanic origin present a high organic matter content low bulk density high water retention capacity low ph and low phosphorus availability buytaert et al 2006 marín et al 2018 andosols cover approximately 70 of the zeo and are mainly located on the hillslopes whereas the histosols cover the remaining area and are mostly found at valley bottoms and flat areas mosquera et al 2015 the vegetation type is highly correlated to the spatial distribution of the soils andosols are mainly covered by tussock grasses calamagostris sp and histosols are associated with the presence of cushion plants plantago rigida xenophyllum humile and azorella spp that grow in the valley bottoms in permanent wet zones known as andean wetlands a small area 5 of zeo is covered by polylepis forests and pine plantations anthropogenic land use and management are limited to extensive livestock grazing in the lower part of the observatory 2 2 hydrometeorological information a nested monitoring approach was used for the collection of water level data at seven tributary subcatchments m1 m7 and the outlet of the zeo m8 fig 1 for the estimation of discharge v notch weirs were used to measure water level at the outlet of the tributary catchments whereas a rectangular weir was used at the outlet of the catchment a schlumberger di500 water level sensor kent wa usa with an accuracy of 5 mm was installed at each site the kindsvater shen equation united states bureau of reclamation 2001 was used to convert water levels into discharge moore 2004 four texas electronics rain gauge tipping buckets te 525mm dallas tx usa were used to record precipitation with a resolution of 0 1 mm water level and precipitation amount were recorded at 5 min intervals from may 2011 to december 2018 the thiessen polygon method was used to estimate precipitation depth for each of the study catchments meteorological variables were monitored using a campbell scientific meteorological station logan ut usa situated at site p1 fig 1 air temperature and relative humidity were measured with a cs 215 probe with an accuracy of 0 3 c for temperature and 2 for relative humidity wind speed was recorded using a met one 034b winset anemometer with an accuracy of 0 11 m s 1 and solar radiation was recorded with an apogee cs300 pyranometer with an accuracy of 5 the collected meteorological variables were also used to calculate daily reference evapotranspiration during the study period using the fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 2 3 collection and analysis of water samples water samples from streamflow and precipitation were collected from may 2011 to december 2018 for isotopic analysis during this period the samples were collected at an event based sub daily to biweekly frequency except in 2016 when samples were collected on a monthly basis grab samples were taken directly from the streams at the locations where water levels were measured m1 m8 fig 1 precipitation samples were gathered with a circular funnel diameter of 16 cm connected to a glass bottle of 1 000 ml at p1 fig 1 the glass bottle was covered with aluminum foil for insulation of direct solar radiation to prevent isotopic fractionation by evaporation a sphere of 4 cm diameter was placed into the funnel and a 5 mm layer of vaseline oil was added to minimize evaporation effects iaea 1997 precipitation and streamflow water samples were collected in 2 ml amber glass containers covered with parafilm and stored unexposed to sunlight mook rozanski 2000 the stable isotopic composition of the collected water samples was measured using a cavity ring down spectrometer l1102 i picarro usa with a precision of 0 1 for o18 picarro secondary reference standards were used in the analysis zero δ18o 0 3 0 2 mid δ18o 20 6 0 2 and depl δ18o 29 3 0 2 zhiña et al 2022 samples of the same water type were analyzed consecutively to minimize memory effects penna et al 2010 six sample injections were carried out to determine the isotopic composition of each water sample following the manufacturer s recommendation to further diminish memory effects the measurements from the first three injections were discarded of the last three injections the maximum difference of δ18o was calculated and compared with the analytic precision of the equipment as well as with the standard deviation of the isotopic composition of the standards used for analysis quality control of the results was carried out and samples that presented measurement differences greater than those values were reanalyzed organic contamination of the isotopic signal was checked with the chemcorrect 1 2 0 software picarro 2010 in accordance with the vienna standard mean ocean water the results are provided in delta notation δ and expressed per mil craig 1960 2 4 mean transit time modelling the mtt of streamflow was estimated using the lumped convolution approach lca which assumes steady state conditions in the hydrological system amin campana 1996 małoszewski zuber 1982 to cope with this assumption only water samples collected during baseflow conditions were used for the analysis i e samples collected during rain events were discarded mcguire et al 2002 in recent years alternative metrics have been developed to overcome the limitations of the steady state assumption as catchments do not always present stationary conditions kirchner 2016a 2016b however it has been demonstrated that the zeo presents a relatively high degree of homogeneity as a result of the low temporal variability of precipitation padrón et al 2015 high atmospheric humidity throughout the year approximately 94 córdova et al 2015 compact geology and the relatively homogeneous properties of the soils mosquera et al 2015 consequently the steady state assumption of the lca was considered valid for the study area lazo et al 2019 the lca is based on the application of a predefined transit time distribution ttd that represents the transit times of all water molecules within catchment storage this can be mathematically expressed by the convolution integral eq 1 which transforms the input tracer signal precipitation into the output tracer signal streamflow małoszewski zuber 1982 1 δ o u t t 0 g τ δ i n t τ d τ where τ is the integration variable representing the mtt of the tracer through the system t is the time of interest which means the time of exit from the system δ o u t t is the tracer composition at time t at the system s outlet g τ is the ttd and δ i n t τ is the input tracer composition at the time t τ ttds are theoretical transfer functions representing the flow system małoszewski zuber 1982 mcguire mcdonnell 2006 a previous mtt investigation at the study area presented a detailed assessment of 5 different ttds and identified the exponential model em as the one that best represents the hydrological behavior of the zeo catchments lazo et al 2019 mosquera et al 2016 stockinger et al 2016 timbe et al 2015 this study therefore used the em which represents the hydrological system as a well mixed reservoir with the following equation 2 g τ 1 τ e x p t τ where τ is the mtt of water in the system which is the only parameter calibrated for the em given the different time resolutions at which data were collected sub daily to monthly the model was run at the coarsest resolution i e monthly this decision was made to homogenize the dataset but also to avoid introducing uncertainties by filling data gaps during periods when only monthly data were available i e 2016 and to avoid comparing mtts which were estimated using data collected at different temporal resolution stockinger et al 2016 timbe et al 2015 to this end precipitation isotopic data collected at finer temporal resolution were volume weighted using their corresponding rainfall amounts and converted into a monthly time series since a significant proportion of runoff in most catchments is generated by water that does not carry the signal of recent rainfall renshaw et al 2003 stream tracer response depends on the actual tracer mass flux for this reason a mass weighted input function was used to take into account previous water recharge to the catchments mcguire mcdonnell 2006 3 δ o u t t 0 g τ ω t τ δ i n t τ d τ 0 g τ ω t τ d τ where ω t is a recharge mass variation function the recharge function was estimated using precipitation amounts corresponding to the monthly δ18o composition of precipitation the mtt was estimated for the whole study period may 2011 december 2018 mtts were also estimated for periods of one year using a monthly moving window for all catchments m1 m8 the yearly time scale of analysis was chosen because mtts at the zeo are shorter than one year for all catchments mosquera et al 2016 thus since the lca assumes steady state conditions it is assumed that a 1 year period of analysis is enough to fulfil this assumption regarding the monthly moving window yearly mtts were estimated for periods starting at different months for example if the first mtt was estimated for the period may 2011 april 2012 the following was estimated for the period june 2011 may 2012 and so on this framework was adopted to investigate the temporal variability of mtts for all catchments the kling gupta efficiency coefficient kge was used to assess the model s performance the kge is a goodness of fit metric between the observed and simulated data in this case streamflow isotopic composition gupta et al 2009 this metric was chosen because within a single objective function it takes into consideration correlation variability and bias error the kge coefficient ranges from to 1 where negative values indicate a poor model performance a value of zero indicates that the mean is a better representation of the system than the model and a value of one indicates a perfect fit of the model in the present study models with kge values higher than 0 45 were considered good predictions timbe et al 2014 initially a monte carlo sampling procedure was employed to conduct 10 000 simulations using a value for parameter τ which was randomly selected from a uniform distribution beven freer 2001 given that the stable isotopes of water allow estimating mtts of water of up to 5 years and the model was run at a monthly time scale the range of τ values used for model calibration varied between 0 and 65 months i e 0 5 years once the parameter value that yielded the highest kge was identified the model was run again using a narrowed parameter range until at least 1 000 behavioral solutions i e simulations with at least 95 of the highest kge were obtained timbe et al 2014 the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue was used to quantify the uncertainty of the model predictions beven binley 1992 as the 5 and 95 limit bounds of the behavioral solutions timbe et al 2014 2 5 evaluation of the factors controlling the temporal variability of mtts the analysis of the hydrological and or meteorological herefter referred to simply as hydrometeorological factors controlling the temporal variability of mtts was conducted for each of the study catchments m1 m8 the following hydrological variables 16 in total were used as potential predictors of the temporal variability of mtts runoff coefficient specific discharge maximum minimum median cumulative and average and non exceedance streamflow rates q10 to q90 and q35 defined as the threshold to classify low flows at the zeo catchments mosquera et al 2016 in addition the subsequent meteorological variables 24 in total were assessed precipitation amount maximum median cumulative and average air temperature maximum minimum median and average relative humidity minimum median and average solar radiation maximum minimum median and average wind speed maximum minimum median and average and evapotranspiration maximum minimum median cumulative and average given the small drainage area of the zeo catchment 10 km2 it was assumed that the spatial variation of evapotranspiration is similar in all catchments m1 m8 also because of the uniformity in the spatial distribution of vegetation and soils mosquera et al 2016 previous research in the study area showed that net radiation related to temperature is the major factor controlling evapotranspiration ochoa sánchez et al 2020 in addition the variation of air temperature decreases with altitude that has an average thermal gradient of 0 5 to 0 7 c per 100 m castaño 2002 der hammen and hooghiemstra 2000 therefore the variation in evapotranspiration among the catchments is expected to be small across the zeo mosquera et al 2016 since the yearly estimated mtts can vary as a function of current and or antecedent hydrometeorological conditions we aggregated the aforementioned hydrometeorological variables 40 in total for the actual conditions i e for the same period in which the mtt estimation was conducted and 16 antecedent periods up to 12 months before the period in which the mtt estimation was carried out to create 680 potential predictors of mtt termporal variability for each of the nested catchments the aggragation procedure is described below using the mtt estimated for the period january 2017 december 2017 as an example the hydrometeorological variables were aggregated for the following periods the same period for which the mtt was estimated or the actual period and the antecedent periods december 2016 november 2017 november 2016 october 2017 october 2016 september 2017 september 2016 august 2017 august 2016 july 2017 july 2016 june 2017 june 2016 may 2017 may 2016 april 2017 april 2016 march 2017 march 2016 february 2017 february 2016 january 2017 january 2016 december 2016 i e yearly periods starting 1 to 12 months before the mtt estimation period yielding the first 12 antecedent periods the hydrometeorological variables were also aggregated for antecedent periods that included the same period used for the estimation of the mtt plus the 3 6 9 and 12 previous months refered to as 0 15 0 18 0 21 and 0 24 antedecent periods respectively following the previous example for the mtt estimated for the period january 2017 december 2017 the hydrometeorological variables were aggregated as follows the period october 2016 december 2017 i e a 15 months period including the mtt estimation period plus 3 months back or 0 15 antecedent period the period july 2016 december 2017 i e a 18 months period including the mtt estimation period plus 6 months back or 0 18 antecedent period the period april 2016 december 2017 i e a 21 months period including the mtt estimation period plus 9 months back or 0 21 antecedent period and the period january 2016 december 2017 i e a 24 months period including the mtt estimation period plus 12 months back or 0 24 antecedent period yielding four additional antecedent periods assuming steady state conditions and since mtts at the zeo during the period 2011 2014 were shorter than one year mosquera et al 2016 aggregation of the hydrometeorological variables up to 1 year before the period in which mtts were estimated was considered as an appropriate antecedent period that could influence the mtts of the nested catchments since hydrometeorological data were not available previous to the study period 57 out of the 81 mtt estimations per catchment were used in the statitical analyses to account for the potential influence of antecedent conditions on mtt temporal variability considering the aforementioned data aggregation procedure a total of 425 hydrometeorological variables were used to evaluate potential associations with the estimated mtts for each catchment as a first step the pearson correlation analysis r was conducted the t test at a 95 confidence level p 0 05 was used to assess the statistical significance of the correlations because more than one predictor variable was found to be acceptably correlated r 0 5 with the mtts a multicollinearity analysis was carried out to avoid unreliable predictions caused by the use of two or more highly correlated explanatory variables yu et al 2015 a correlation matrix among the independent variables was used to exclude redundant variables for this purpose a threshold of coefficient of determination r2 0 75 was applied siegel 2016 then the variance inflation factor vif criteria of less than or equal to 3 was applied to the remaining variables this analysis prevented overfitting issues which could potentially obscure important relations among variables lin et al 2011 following the multicollinearity analysis multiple linear regression mlr analysis was carried out through a forward criterion using the root mean square error rmse as objective function montgomery et al 2015 the forward criterion starts without any predictor variable and then adds additional variables one by one as the rmse decreases derksen keselman 1992 the mlr was implemented in r studio software version 4 0 2 using the caret library to assess the robustness of the mlr results leave one out cross validation was applied loovc efron 1983 stone 1974 given 57 mtt estimations were available for each study catchment for all antecedent conditions mlr models up to 5 variables were considered since a threshold of one variable per 10 observations is recommended austin steyerberg 2015 vittinghoff mcculloch 2007 the performance of the models was evaluated using r2 and adjusted r2 r2 adj the akaike information criterion aic p values of the f test and the mean absolute error mae r2 assumes that every explanatory variable in the model helps to explain the variance in the dependent variable whereas r2 adj gives the percentage of variation explained by only those explanatory variables that affect the dependent variable and penalizes the addition of independent variables pham 2019 as a criterion of information of the parsimony the model with a smallest value for the akaike information criterion aic was selected akaike 1974 the f test at a 95 confidence level p 0 05 was used to assess the statistical significance of the regression models the following two criteria were used to identify the model that best explained the temporal variability of mtts adjusted r2 0 5 and mae less than half the standard deviation of the mtts during the period of analysis santhi et al 2001 3 results 3 1

composition in streamflow was more attenuated mean value 10 7 0 1 table 1 than in precipitation the isotopic variability of stream water was similar in all catchments except for m7 whose isotopic composition strongly resembled that of precipitation this is because catchment m7 functions as a shallow pounded wetland in which precipitation water rapidly leaves the catchment correa et al 2018

goodness of fit of the objective function was higher than the threshold for model acceptance i e kge 0 45 fig 4 analysis of the mtts estimated for yearly periods using a monthly moving window resulted in 81 model fits per study catchment results of this analysis for catchment m6 are shown in fig 5 for this catchment the average standard deviation value of the mtts were 5 9 1 4 months 175 5 41 7 days kge values of the associated simulations were higher than the threshold for model acceptance ranging between 0 45 and 0 77 fig 5 mtts 4 months and 8 months accounted for 87 6 of the total while 7 4 and 5 0 were higher than 8 months and shorter than 4 months respectively the longest mtts were observed from late 2014 to mid 2015 while the shortest occurred in early 2014 and from mid 2017 until the end of the study period december 2018 fig 5 a similar temporal variability of mtts was observed for the rest of the zeo catchments using the monthly moving window approach see fig s3 in the supplementary material yearly estimated mtts for all study catchments indicate the dominance of short mtts i e 96 of them were shorter than 1 year across the zeo fig 6 a associated with generally acceptable kge values varying between 0 51 0 15 and 0 82 0 05 fig 6b similar to the results using the complete dataset catchments m3 9 3 2 3 or 278 1 68 3 days m4 7 9 2 1 months or 236 6 63 1 days and m5 8 0 1 9 months or 239 9 56 0 days presented the longest mtts fig 6a catchments m1 7 1 2 1 months or 213 2 63 8 days m2 5 3 1 1 months or 159 1 33 9 days m6 5 9 1 4 months or 175 5 41 7 days and m8 5 8 1 3 months or 175 3 37 5 days showed intermediate mtt values the shortest mtts were found at m7 1 8 0 4 months or 52 4 12 1 days 3 3 identification of factors controlling the temporal variability of mtts linear correlation results showed that several hydrometeorological variables were at least acceptably correlated r 0 5 with the yearly estimated mtts for each of the analyzed catchments the subsequent vif multicollinearity analysis identified between 8 and 11 independent variables which could significantly explain the mtt temporal variability in each of the catchments those variables were used to identify the main hydrometeorological factors controlling the temporal variability of mtts through mlr analysis since the presented analysis was carried out using monthly data analysis for catchment m7 which presented very short water mtts 1 2 months could not be pursued as its mtt temporal variability likely depends on antecedent conditions in the order of days or weeks for the rest of the catchments the results of the mlr models fulfilling the conditions for best model selection are shown in table 2 that is the mlr model with the least number of predictive variables fulfilling both criteria for best model selection in terms of error reduction rmse standard deviation of the estimated mtts and goodness of fit r2 adj 0 5 results of the mlr analysis for catchment m6 are shown in fig 7 eight hydrometeorological variables were considered in the mlr models of this catchment after performing the multicollinearity analysis etmin6 qmax0 pcum0 rc7 qmin12 rc12 pcum15 and rc18 these variables were used in the forward criterion mlr to develop and test mlr models with up to 5 variables models a1 to a5 results of the 5 mlr models a1 to a5 are described below and the models equations and coefficients of the predictor variables are shown in fig 7 model a1 included rc12 as the only predictive variable and explained 22 of the dataset variance model a2 included two variables namely rc7 and rc12 and explained 41 of the dataset variability model a3 included 3 variables qmin12 rc7 and rc12 explaining 51 of the variance model a4 included all variables in model a3 and qmax0 explaining 57 of the mtts temporal variation model a5 included all variables in model a4 and pcum0 5 variables in total accounting for 60 of the dataset variability the rmse of the models decreased from 40 49 model a1 to 27 99 model a5 and all predictor variables had a positive relation with the mtts in the mlr models fig 7 model a3 was selected as the one best representing the temporal variability of mtts for catchment m6 as it complied with the aforementioned conditions for model acceptance the same analysis conducted for the remaining catchments indicated that the number of variables necessary to achieve model acceptance conditions for each of them varied between 2 and 5 the models equations and coefficients of the predictor variables are presented in table 2 similar to the results for catchment m6 all predictor variables presented a positive relation with mtts on the mlrs of the rest of the catchments two predictive variables were found for catchments m1 qmd8 and qmin0 15 m2 qmin10 and pcum0 and m3 q300 18 qmd7 the mlr for catchment m4 required 3 predictive variables q300 18 rc9 and qmx7 the models for catchments m5 and m8 required the largest number of predictive variables 4 for m5 qmd12 qcum24 pmx12 and qcum9 and 5 for m8 qmin12 pmd10 pmx9 qmx12 and qcum0 all of these models presented relatively low rmse from 22 60 to 47 98 the models had r2 adj values ranging from 0 50 and 0 58 table 2 indicating that all models explain at least 50 of the mtt temporal variability for each catchment the average aic value among catchments was low suggesting that the selected models are parsimonious results from the f tests show that all models are significant at p 10 9 4 discussion 4 1 mean transit time modelling taking advantage of an 8 year data set from a nested system of tropical andean catchments this study addresses one of the 23 unsolved problems in hydrology blöschl et al 2019 how old is stream water and how do water ages vary in time to this end it is necessary to evaluate the assumptions of the applied mtt modelling approach one limitation of the lca for estimating mtts is the fulfillment of the assumptions of hydrological stationarity i e invariance in time and homogeneity of the studied catchments kirchner 2016a despite the ample temporal variability in hydrological and meteorological conditions observed during the 8 years monitoring period at the zeo fig 2 and s1 the temporal variability of mtts across the catchments was small 191 30 47 10 days contrary to evidence of non stationary conditions in other tropical birkel et al 2016 and non tropical montane catchments peralta tapia et al 2016 this observation supports the hypothesis that the zeo catchments function close to stationary conditions this results from relatively homogeneous landscape characteristics i e vegetation distribution and soil properties topography and geology and low temporal variability of climate conditions correa et al 2018 lazo et al 2019 mosquera et al 2016 this finding also suggests that the zeo catchments meet the steady state assumptions of the lca applied to estimate the presented mtts in addition the fact that the estimated mtts were shorter than the yearly periods applied to investigate mtt temporal variability in this study indicates that our results can be considered reliable and robust as evidenced by the low uncertainty in the modelling results to put our findings in context fig 8 summarizes the temporal variability of mtts and the factors influencing them of different catchments worldwide the mtts at the zeo were shorter than 1 year when modelled using both the complete dataset and yearly periods using a monthly moving window figs 4 and 6 these mtts are consistent with typical values found in pristine catchments of 10 km2 in other regions fig 8 tetzlaff et al 2011 hrachowitz et al 2010 soulsby et al 2006 these values are also similar to prior mtt estimations in the same study area during the period 2011 2014 up to 9 months mosquera et al 2016 these findings support the concept of rapid rainfall runoff dynamics and a minimum contribution of deep groundwater given the compacted underlying geology mosquera et al 2015 a rapid hydrologic response could also be explained by the limited soil depth up to 1 m presenting a porous and open soil structure with a high water storage capacity particularly in the riparian wetlands lazo et al 2019 wetlands are hydrologically connected to slopes especially during wet periods and surface water does not evaporate strongly as humidity remains high throughout the year 90 córdova et al 2015 the short mtts are likely influenced by high soil wetness and increased connectivity of shallow subsurface flow paths birkel et al 2012 rinaldo et al 2011 segura et al 2012 as a consequence the soils remain wet most of the time and their high porosity results in a fast mobilization of water throughout the entire soil profile mosquera et al 2020 allowing for a continuous recharge of riparian wetlands which sustain flow production year round mosquera et al 2015 in another study conducted in the scottish highlands mtt temporal variability was assessed in two small catchments with different features hrachowitz et al 2009 one of the catchments was characterized by low permeable gleyed soils overlying compacted geology the second catchment was dominated by free draining podzolic soils situated on deep extensively fractured bedrock the former presented mtts shorter than 1 year fig 8 135 202 days agreeing well with our results as it presented similar conditions to the zeo and thus a comparable hydrological behavior in which soils that remain close to saturation favor a rapid response of streamflow via the shallow subsurface with minimal contributions of groundwater the latter catchment had much longer mtts 1 830 1 970 days as a result of the dominance of a well mixed groundwater reservoir in the system of bedrock fractures which differs from the situation at the zeo in other environments i e temperate or boreal mtts show a large variability due to groundwater influences in contrast to the zeo where mtts vary little in a study conducted in a temperate zone mtts were estimated using a 1 month moving window with a 10 year data set in five japanese meso catchments ma yamanaka 2013 2016 the average mtt across the catchments was 23 7 years and the temporal variation was similar in the five sub catchments ranging from 1 2 to 37 years contrary to the zeo hydrological system mtts up to few decades reflect a delayed groundwater response and high water storage in the large groundwater reservoir of the japanese catchments in another study in a boreal catchment in sweden mtts ranged from 300 to 1 400 days using a 10 year data set and a monthly moving window peralta tapia et al 2016 these results differed from our study area because of the older groundwater contributions to streamflow and the large temporal changes in stored water due to strong climate seasonality across the year unlike in our study area where the water storage is continuously high due to sustained rainfall inputs throughout the year 4 2 identification of factors controlling temporal variability of mtts the main factors controlling the temporal variability of mtts at the zeo are precipitation streamflow and runoff coefficient table 2 and fig 7 it is reasonable that precipitation is a driver of mtts as it acts as a force that pushes water out of the soil matrix whereas streamflow reflects the system s response to water mobilization i e mixture of precipitation and soil water at the zeo the rapid filling of the soil water reservoir during rainfall events correa et al 2018 and the soil s high water storage capacity lazo et al 2019 result in a year round moist soil system this hydrological status favors the supply of baseflow to streams and supports the shallow water table in páramo areas around the south ecuadorian highlands therefore the occurrence of rapid subsurface flow in the shallow soil layers which remain near saturation explains why the runoff coefficient is a key variable influencing baseflow mtts for these reasons it is not surprising that antecedent conditions of these hydrological variables up to 1 year influence the temporal variability of mtts with the longest antecedent conditions being most important in spring dominated catchments because of their higher water storage capacity lazo et al 2019 similar results to our research were obtained in a boreal catchment in northern sweden fig 8 in that catchment a strong correlation between annually estimated mtts and yearly precipitation was found peralta tapia et al 2016 suggesting that antecedent soil moisture conditions influence mtt estimates in our study area the longest mtts occurred during the least wet periods e g late 2014 to mid 2015characterised by lower than average precipitation and the shortest ones during the wettest periods in which rapid runoff was facilitated by the high saturated hydraulic conductivity of the organic rich soil and the compacted underlying geologic layers mtt variability was also found to be controlled by the amount of precipitation in two zero order catchments in the usa heidbüchel et al 2013 similar to our findings these authors reported that precipitation events during the wettest periods caused the water storage capacity of soils to reach saturation resulting in fast runoff composed of young water in contrast to our findings the amount of stored groundwater was found as a primary control on mtts temporal variation in a temperate meso catchment in japan fig 8 ma yamanaka 2016 these results differ from ours because deep groundwater contributions at the zeo are almost negligible similar to our findings mtts were also found to be correlated with runoff coefficient in a semi arid catchment in southeastern australia cartwright et al 2020 cartwright morgenstern 2015 notwithstanding different processes explain the identified relations in the australian study site and the zeo high evaporation and transpiration rates low precipitation inputs and hence a reduced groundwater recharge rate explain the temporal variability of mtts in the semi arid australian environment differently fairly sustained precipitation inputs padrón et al 2015 and low transpiration rates ochoa sánchez et al 2020 in combination with almost negligible contributions of deep groundwater mosquera et al 2020 mosquera et al 2016 likely explain the relation between mtts and runoff coefficient at the zeo catchments the fact that evapotranspiration was not identified as a driver of the temporal variability of mtts suggests that beyond precipitation local climate has little influence on how water mixes in the subsurface the latter is most likely because of the high air humidity and limited available energy at zeo year round córdova et al 2016 ochoa sánchez et al 2020 this finding is in line with a previous investigation in 20 scottish highland catchments with similar landscape and climate conditions as in our study site hrachowitz et al 2009 however a previous investigation in a tropical catchment in costa rica revealed that wind speed strongly correlates with mtts fig 8 birkel et al 2016 the authors attributed this finding to the fact that local climate is strongly affected by the air masses arriving from different directions pacific coast versus the caribbean sea which in turn influences the temporal variability of subsurface water recharge and storage in contrast our analysis indicates that climate variables did not influence catchment storage and mixing processes most likely because of the year round uniform distribution of precipitation originating preferentially from the east side of the andean mountain range esquivel hernández et al 2019 zhiña et al 2022 the discrepancy might also be due to the difference in the time periods and moving window spans used in both studies while our analysis was conducted using yearly moving window spans i e a complete hydrological cycle over an 8 year period the analysis for the catchment in costa rica was carried out during a short time period 2 years using a 4 months moving window given this it is likely that the variable controlling the mtt variability in costa rica i e wind speed accounts for short term seasonal changes in catchment hydrology differing from the medium long term controls on catchment storage identified in our study these contrasting results highlight the importance of acquiring datasets covering several hydrometeorological cycles for the better understanding of the rainfall runoff processes in tropical regions although there are similarities and differences between the findings of previous studies and ours the combination of streamflow precipitation and runoff coefficient as driving factors of the temporal variability of mtts has not been reported before in the tropics or elsewhere fig 8 this may be due to the strong interplay between precipitation and streamflow which controls subsurface water transport and mixing processes in our study area under the presence of riparian wetlands connected to the stream network and the virtually absent contribution of deep groundwater storage mosquera et al 2015 5 conclusions this study contributes to an improved understanding of the underlying causes of the temporal variability of mtts in remote montane catchments based on this study it can be concluded that mtts in tropical alpine catchments in southern ecuador are shorter than 1 year and demonstrate little temporal variation indicating the prevalence of quasi steady state conditions as a result lumped models represent a useful tool to investigate hydrological dynamics in the region the factors controlling the temporal variability of mtts across the studied catchments are precipitation streamflow and runoff coefficient under different antecedent conditions up to 1 year indicating that runoff generation is dominated by the connectivity of subsurface flow paths through shallow organic soil layers in line with previous conceptualziation of catchment hydrological behavior these results highlight the importance of investigating what drives the temporal variation of mtts as this helps to better understand water flow paths and catchment behavior which is essential to develop appropriate water management and climate adaptation strategies if moisture conditions change shorter mtts can impact nutrient removal and pollutant export changes in water flow paths and catchment behavior caused by changes in climate or land use could also result in variations in the ages of stream water as this study looked at catchments characterised by a natural páramo ecosystem and similar climate conditions future investigations could focus on assessing the temporal variability of mtts and the factors influencing it in catchments with different land use types and constrasting climate further research involving the factors controlling mtts at a larger spatial scale for tropical alpine catchments is also recommended

2378,the mean transit time mtt of water is an essential descriptor of streamflow generation and catchment water storage research on how mtts fluctuate over time and the variables influencing such variation is limited in this study bi weekly stable isotopic data in precipitation and streamflow were used together with daily records of hydrometeorological information to investigate the temporal variability of streamflow mtts the data were collected over 8 years in a nested system of 8 tropical alpine catchments in the zhurucay ecohydrological observatory in southern ecuador 3 450 to 3 900 m a s l the temporal variability of streamflow mtts was estimated using yearly periods and a 1 month moving window i e 81 yearly calculated mtts per catchment the factors controlling the temporal variability of mtts were identified using simple and multiple linear regression models with hydrometeorological parameters as explanatory variables results reveal that streamflow mtts in all catchments were short 1 year and varied little among catchments 191 30 47 10 days a combination of hydrometeorological variables i e precipitation streamflow and runoff coefficient over antecedent periods up to 1 year was found to control mtt temporal variability overall these findings point to the prevalence of low temporal variability of hydrological conditions in the investigated catchments our study is key to provide insights into the factors controlling the temporal variability of streamflow mtt in tropical catchments overcoming data limitations of past investigations and with significant implications for improved water supply management keywords transit time stables isotopes tracer hydrology páramo temporal variability tropical montane data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction one of the most common catchment descriptors in hydrologic studies is the mean transit time mtt of streamflow mtt is defined as the mean age of water that enters a catchment during previous precipitation events at the time of exit at an outlet point i e streams springs soils mcguire mcdonnell 2006 this hydrological descriptor contains information about water storage and the flow paths that water follows in a catchment mcguire mcdonnell 2006 the mtt of stream water helps to better conceptualize the hydrological and biogrochemical processes of a catchment burns et al 2003 hence the mtt is a key hydrological parameter for risk assessment contaminant remediation land use change climate change and improved management of water resources landon et al 2000 nystrom 1985 turner et al 2006 mtt can be calculated by modeling the relationship between input and output signals of conservative tracers such as water stable isotopes 2h and 18o mcguire mcdonnell 2006 or chloride kirchner et al 2010 among the most common methods to estimate the mtt of water are the lumped convolution approach lca the fourier method and the sine save method benettin et al 2015 these methods take advantage of the damping of the isotopic composition of streamflow relative to the temporal variation of the isotopic composition of precipitation due to mixing processes the application of these methods could be difficult due to a range of uncertainties caused by the spatial and temporal variability of the isotopic composition of water the unavailability of long term tracer records and low sampling frequency due to financial and logistical constraints hrachowitz soulsby tetzlaff speed 2009 mcguire mcdonnell 2006 notwithstanding the study of mtt is crucial since it enables a better understanding of runoff generation processes and the hydrological behavior of a catchment several studies have focused on determining stream water mtt in a variety of environments worldwide in tropical e g farrick and branfireun 2015 jacobs et al 2018 mosquera et al 2016 muñoz villers et al 2016 timbe et al 2014 and non tropical e g hale et al 2016 hrachowitz et al 2009 lyon et al 2010 mcguire et al 2005 soulsby et al 2006 uchida and asano 2010 vitvar and balderer 1997 montane catchments those investigations were usually limited by the availability of short term tracer datasets ranging from one to a few years which did not allow identifying temporal changes in catchment hydrological function since mtts vary in time due to seasonal and annual changes in hydrometeorological conditions birkel et al 2015 hrachowitz et al 2009 ma yamanaka 2016 understanding those variations and their drivers is crucial to unraveling the change in hydrological behavior of a catchment to date most of the studies investigating the temporal variability of streamflow mtts have been conducted in temperate regions for example hrachowitz et al 2009 applied a moving window approach to estimate the variability of streamflow mtts over 8 years in two small catchments 1 km2 in the scottish highlands these authors found that the temporal variability in mtt was influenced by precipitation amount applying a similar approach over 10 years ma yamanaka 2016 investigated the temporal variation of mtt for five temperate catchments 268 2173 km2 in central japan differing in slope geology and soil type these authors reported that the estimated mtts were longer during drier periods than during wetter periods and were mainly controlled by geology another study was carried out in a boreal catchment in north sweden 0 47 km2 using a 10 year isotopic data record peralta tapia et al 2016 the authors determined a strong correlation between annual rainfall and mtts during snow free periods in another study conducted in 4 catchments in southeast australia 8 7 323 km2 using 3 years of data mtts were found to be correlated with runoff coefficient cartwright et al 2020 in a tropical setting birkel et al 2016 investigated the temporal variability of streamflow mtts in a humid forested catchment 30 km2 in costa rica these authors applied a lumped convolution model to a short term isotopic tracer dataset 2 years using a monthly moving window to estimate streamflow mtts over 4 month time spans even though this is to our best knowledge the only study to date that investigated the temporal variability of mtts in the tropics the reported mtts could present large uncertainties since estimated mtts were longer than the data records used for model calibration particularly during dry periods i e mtts varied between 5 and 12 months wind direction was reported as the most important meteorological variable influencing the temporal variability of mtts in this topical catchment considering the limited information on the temporal variability of mtts in tropical settings we aim to fill this knowledge gap by taking advantage of a unique long term tracer dataset in precipitation and streamflow collected over 8 years across a nested system of 8 tropical alpine páramo catchments in southern ecuador to this end the specific objectives of this study are 1 to estimate the temporal variability of mtts across a nested system of tropical alpine catchments and 2 to identify which hydrometeorological conditions control the temporal variability of mtts across the catchments if any 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study site is the zhurucay ecohydrological observatory zeo 3 4 s 79 14 w located on the western slopes of the andean mountain range in southern ecuador fig 1 the observatory has a drainage area of 7 53 km2 with an elevation ranging from 3 505 to 3 900 m a s l the zeo is located in a tropical alpine páramo ecosystem the local climate is primarily influenced by continental air masses stemming from the amazon basin which originate mainly in the atlantic ocean esquivel hernández et al 2019 zhiña et al in production annual precipitation is 1 345 mm at 3 780 m a s l precipitation shows low seasonality and is mainly composed of drizzle padrón et al 2015 according to these authors the wettest period lasts from march to may and the least wet period from august to october mean annual temperature is 6 c mean relative humidity is 93 6 córdova et al 2015 and solar radiation is 4 942 mj m 2 per year carrillo rojas et al 2019 at 3 780 m a s l annual actual evapotranspiration is 622 mm ochoa sánchez et al 2019 although the temporal varbility of mtts in the study region has not yet been investigated an analysis of the spatial variability of mtts at the study site was conducted previously mosquera et al 2016 this study showed that mtts varied between 4 and 9 months and that their spatial variability across the observatory was controlled by average slope the geomorphology of the study catchments is u shaped with an average slope of 17 as a result of glacial activity mosquera et al 2015 the geology is compacted and dominated by the quimsacocha and turi formations characterized by volcanic rock deposits compacted during the glacial activity of the last ice age coltorti ollier 2000 both formations date from the late miocene pratt et al 1997 lithology in the quimsacocha formation is composed of basaltic flows with plagioclases feldspars and andesitic pyroclasts whereas the turi formation is composed of tuffaceous andesitic breccias conglomerates and horizontally stratified sands hungerbühler et al 2002 the main soil types in zhurucay are classified as andosols and histosols iuss working group wrb 2015 formed by the accumulation of volcanic ash in combination with the humid cold climate conditions quichimbo et al 2012 these soils of volcanic origin present a high organic matter content low bulk density high water retention capacity low ph and low phosphorus availability buytaert et al 2006 marín et al 2018 andosols cover approximately 70 of the zeo and are mainly located on the hillslopes whereas the histosols cover the remaining area and are mostly found at valley bottoms and flat areas mosquera et al 2015 the vegetation type is highly correlated to the spatial distribution of the soils andosols are mainly covered by tussock grasses calamagostris sp and histosols are associated with the presence of cushion plants plantago rigida xenophyllum humile and azorella spp that grow in the valley bottoms in permanent wet zones known as andean wetlands a small area 5 of zeo is covered by polylepis forests and pine plantations anthropogenic land use and management are limited to extensive livestock grazing in the lower part of the observatory 2 2 hydrometeorological information a nested monitoring approach was used for the collection of water level data at seven tributary subcatchments m1 m7 and the outlet of the zeo m8 fig 1 for the estimation of discharge v notch weirs were used to measure water level at the outlet of the tributary catchments whereas a rectangular weir was used at the outlet of the catchment a schlumberger di500 water level sensor kent wa usa with an accuracy of 5 mm was installed at each site the kindsvater shen equation united states bureau of reclamation 2001 was used to convert water levels into discharge moore 2004 four texas electronics rain gauge tipping buckets te 525mm dallas tx usa were used to record precipitation with a resolution of 0 1 mm water level and precipitation amount were recorded at 5 min intervals from may 2011 to december 2018 the thiessen polygon method was used to estimate precipitation depth for each of the study catchments meteorological variables were monitored using a campbell scientific meteorological station logan ut usa situated at site p1 fig 1 air temperature and relative humidity were measured with a cs 215 probe with an accuracy of 0 3 c for temperature and 2 for relative humidity wind speed was recorded using a met one 034b winset anemometer with an accuracy of 0 11 m s 1 and solar radiation was recorded with an apogee cs300 pyranometer with an accuracy of 5 the collected meteorological variables were also used to calculate daily reference evapotranspiration during the study period using the fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 2 3 collection and analysis of water samples water samples from streamflow and precipitation were collected from may 2011 to december 2018 for isotopic analysis during this period the samples were collected at an event based sub daily to biweekly frequency except in 2016 when samples were collected on a monthly basis grab samples were taken directly from the streams at the locations where water levels were measured m1 m8 fig 1 precipitation samples were gathered with a circular funnel diameter of 16 cm connected to a glass bottle of 1 000 ml at p1 fig 1 the glass bottle was covered with aluminum foil for insulation of direct solar radiation to prevent isotopic fractionation by evaporation a sphere of 4 cm diameter was placed into the funnel and a 5 mm layer of vaseline oil was added to minimize evaporation effects iaea 1997 precipitation and streamflow water samples were collected in 2 ml amber glass containers covered with parafilm and stored unexposed to sunlight mook rozanski 2000 the stable isotopic composition of the collected water samples was measured using a cavity ring down spectrometer l1102 i picarro usa with a precision of 0 1 for o18 picarro secondary reference standards were used in the analysis zero δ18o 0 3 0 2 mid δ18o 20 6 0 2 and depl δ18o 29 3 0 2 zhiña et al 2022 samples of the same water type were analyzed consecutively to minimize memory effects penna et al 2010 six sample injections were carried out to determine the isotopic composition of each water sample following the manufacturer s recommendation to further diminish memory effects the measurements from the first three injections were discarded of the last three injections the maximum difference of δ18o was calculated and compared with the analytic precision of the equipment as well as with the standard deviation of the isotopic composition of the standards used for analysis quality control of the results was carried out and samples that presented measurement differences greater than those values were reanalyzed organic contamination of the isotopic signal was checked with the chemcorrect 1 2 0 software picarro 2010 in accordance with the vienna standard mean ocean water the results are provided in delta notation δ and expressed per mil craig 1960 2 4 mean transit time modelling the mtt of streamflow was estimated using the lumped convolution approach lca which assumes steady state conditions in the hydrological system amin campana 1996 małoszewski zuber 1982 to cope with this assumption only water samples collected during baseflow conditions were used for the analysis i e samples collected during rain events were discarded mcguire et al 2002 in recent years alternative metrics have been developed to overcome the limitations of the steady state assumption as catchments do not always present stationary conditions kirchner 2016a 2016b however it has been demonstrated that the zeo presents a relatively high degree of homogeneity as a result of the low temporal variability of precipitation padrón et al 2015 high atmospheric humidity throughout the year approximately 94 córdova et al 2015 compact geology and the relatively homogeneous properties of the soils mosquera et al 2015 consequently the steady state assumption of the lca was considered valid for the study area lazo et al 2019 the lca is based on the application of a predefined transit time distribution ttd that represents the transit times of all water molecules within catchment storage this can be mathematically expressed by the convolution integral eq 1 which transforms the input tracer signal precipitation into the output tracer signal streamflow małoszewski zuber 1982 1 δ o u t t 0 g τ δ i n t τ d τ where τ is the integration variable representing the mtt of the tracer through the system t is the time of interest which means the time of exit from the system δ o u t t is the tracer composition at time t at the system s outlet g τ is the ttd and δ i n t τ is the input tracer composition at the time t τ ttds are theoretical transfer functions representing the flow system małoszewski zuber 1982 mcguire mcdonnell 2006 a previous mtt investigation at the study area presented a detailed assessment of 5 different ttds and identified the exponential model em as the one that best represents the hydrological behavior of the zeo catchments lazo et al 2019 mosquera et al 2016 stockinger et al 2016 timbe et al 2015 this study therefore used the em which represents the hydrological system as a well mixed reservoir with the following equation 2 g τ 1 τ e x p t τ where τ is the mtt of water in the system which is the only parameter calibrated for the em given the different time resolutions at which data were collected sub daily to monthly the model was run at the coarsest resolution i e monthly this decision was made to homogenize the dataset but also to avoid introducing uncertainties by filling data gaps during periods when only monthly data were available i e 2016 and to avoid comparing mtts which were estimated using data collected at different temporal resolution stockinger et al 2016 timbe et al 2015 to this end precipitation isotopic data collected at finer temporal resolution were volume weighted using their corresponding rainfall amounts and converted into a monthly time series since a significant proportion of runoff in most catchments is generated by water that does not carry the signal of recent rainfall renshaw et al 2003 stream tracer response depends on the actual tracer mass flux for this reason a mass weighted input function was used to take into account previous water recharge to the catchments mcguire mcdonnell 2006 3 δ o u t t 0 g τ ω t τ δ i n t τ d τ 0 g τ ω t τ d τ where ω t is a recharge mass variation function the recharge function was estimated using precipitation amounts corresponding to the monthly δ18o composition of precipitation the mtt was estimated for the whole study period may 2011 december 2018 mtts were also estimated for periods of one year using a monthly moving window for all catchments m1 m8 the yearly time scale of analysis was chosen because mtts at the zeo are shorter than one year for all catchments mosquera et al 2016 thus since the lca assumes steady state conditions it is assumed that a 1 year period of analysis is enough to fulfil this assumption regarding the monthly moving window yearly mtts were estimated for periods starting at different months for example if the first mtt was estimated for the period may 2011 april 2012 the following was estimated for the period june 2011 may 2012 and so on this framework was adopted to investigate the temporal variability of mtts for all catchments the kling gupta efficiency coefficient kge was used to assess the model s performance the kge is a goodness of fit metric between the observed and simulated data in this case streamflow isotopic composition gupta et al 2009 this metric was chosen because within a single objective function it takes into consideration correlation variability and bias error the kge coefficient ranges from to 1 where negative values indicate a poor model performance a value of zero indicates that the mean is a better representation of the system than the model and a value of one indicates a perfect fit of the model in the present study models with kge values higher than 0 45 were considered good predictions timbe et al 2014 initially a monte carlo sampling procedure was employed to conduct 10 000 simulations using a value for parameter τ which was randomly selected from a uniform distribution beven freer 2001 given that the stable isotopes of water allow estimating mtts of water of up to 5 years and the model was run at a monthly time scale the range of τ values used for model calibration varied between 0 and 65 months i e 0 5 years once the parameter value that yielded the highest kge was identified the model was run again using a narrowed parameter range until at least 1 000 behavioral solutions i e simulations with at least 95 of the highest kge were obtained timbe et al 2014 the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue was used to quantify the uncertainty of the model predictions beven binley 1992 as the 5 and 95 limit bounds of the behavioral solutions timbe et al 2014 2 5 evaluation of the factors controlling the temporal variability of mtts the analysis of the hydrological and or meteorological herefter referred to simply as hydrometeorological factors controlling the temporal variability of mtts was conducted for each of the study catchments m1 m8 the following hydrological variables 16 in total were used as potential predictors of the temporal variability of mtts runoff coefficient specific discharge maximum minimum median cumulative and average and non exceedance streamflow rates q10 to q90 and q35 defined as the threshold to classify low flows at the zeo catchments mosquera et al 2016 in addition the subsequent meteorological variables 24 in total were assessed precipitation amount maximum median cumulative and average air temperature maximum minimum median and average relative humidity minimum median and average solar radiation maximum minimum median and average wind speed maximum minimum median and average and evapotranspiration maximum minimum median cumulative and average given the small drainage area of the zeo catchment 10 km2 it was assumed that the spatial variation of evapotranspiration is similar in all catchments m1 m8 also because of the uniformity in the spatial distribution of vegetation and soils mosquera et al 2016 previous research in the study area showed that net radiation related to temperature is the major factor controlling evapotranspiration ochoa sánchez et al 2020 in addition the variation of air temperature decreases with altitude that has an average thermal gradient of 0 5 to 0 7 c per 100 m castaño 2002 der hammen and hooghiemstra 2000 therefore the variation in evapotranspiration among the catchments is expected to be small across the zeo mosquera et al 2016 since the yearly estimated mtts can vary as a function of current and or antecedent hydrometeorological conditions we aggregated the aforementioned hydrometeorological variables 40 in total for the actual conditions i e for the same period in which the mtt estimation was conducted and 16 antecedent periods up to 12 months before the period in which the mtt estimation was carried out to create 680 potential predictors of mtt termporal variability for each of the nested catchments the aggragation procedure is described below using the mtt estimated for the period january 2017 december 2017 as an example the hydrometeorological variables were aggregated for the following periods the same period for which the mtt was estimated or the actual period and the antecedent periods december 2016 november 2017 november 2016 october 2017 october 2016 september 2017 september 2016 august 2017 august 2016 july 2017 july 2016 june 2017 june 2016 may 2017 may 2016 april 2017 april 2016 march 2017 march 2016 february 2017 february 2016 january 2017 january 2016 december 2016 i e yearly periods starting 1 to 12 months before the mtt estimation period yielding the first 12 antecedent periods the hydrometeorological variables were also aggregated for antecedent periods that included the same period used for the estimation of the mtt plus the 3 6 9 and 12 previous months refered to as 0 15 0 18 0 21 and 0 24 antedecent periods respectively following the previous example for the mtt estimated for the period january 2017 december 2017 the hydrometeorological variables were aggregated as follows the period october 2016 december 2017 i e a 15 months period including the mtt estimation period plus 3 months back or 0 15 antecedent period the period july 2016 december 2017 i e a 18 months period including the mtt estimation period plus 6 months back or 0 18 antecedent period the period april 2016 december 2017 i e a 21 months period including the mtt estimation period plus 9 months back or 0 21 antecedent period and the period january 2016 december 2017 i e a 24 months period including the mtt estimation period plus 12 months back or 0 24 antecedent period yielding four additional antecedent periods assuming steady state conditions and since mtts at the zeo during the period 2011 2014 were shorter than one year mosquera et al 2016 aggregation of the hydrometeorological variables up to 1 year before the period in which mtts were estimated was considered as an appropriate antecedent period that could influence the mtts of the nested catchments since hydrometeorological data were not available previous to the study period 57 out of the 81 mtt estimations per catchment were used in the statitical analyses to account for the potential influence of antecedent conditions on mtt temporal variability considering the aforementioned data aggregation procedure a total of 425 hydrometeorological variables were used to evaluate potential associations with the estimated mtts for each catchment as a first step the pearson correlation analysis r was conducted the t test at a 95 confidence level p 0 05 was used to assess the statistical significance of the correlations because more than one predictor variable was found to be acceptably correlated r 0 5 with the mtts a multicollinearity analysis was carried out to avoid unreliable predictions caused by the use of two or more highly correlated explanatory variables yu et al 2015 a correlation matrix among the independent variables was used to exclude redundant variables for this purpose a threshold of coefficient of determination r2 0 75 was applied siegel 2016 then the variance inflation factor vif criteria of less than or equal to 3 was applied to the remaining variables this analysis prevented overfitting issues which could potentially obscure important relations among variables lin et al 2011 following the multicollinearity analysis multiple linear regression mlr analysis was carried out through a forward criterion using the root mean square error rmse as objective function montgomery et al 2015 the forward criterion starts without any predictor variable and then adds additional variables one by one as the rmse decreases derksen keselman 1992 the mlr was implemented in r studio software version 4 0 2 using the caret library to assess the robustness of the mlr results leave one out cross validation was applied loovc efron 1983 stone 1974 given 57 mtt estimations were available for each study catchment for all antecedent conditions mlr models up to 5 variables were considered since a threshold of one variable per 10 observations is recommended austin steyerberg 2015 vittinghoff mcculloch 2007 the performance of the models was evaluated using r2 and adjusted r2 r2 adj the akaike information criterion aic p values of the f test and the mean absolute error mae r2 assumes that every explanatory variable in the model helps to explain the variance in the dependent variable whereas r2 adj gives the percentage of variation explained by only those explanatory variables that affect the dependent variable and penalizes the addition of independent variables pham 2019 as a criterion of information of the parsimony the model with a smallest value for the akaike information criterion aic was selected akaike 1974 the f test at a 95 confidence level p 0 05 was used to assess the statistical significance of the regression models the following two criteria were used to identify the model that best explained the temporal variability of mtts adjusted r2 0 5 and mae less than half the standard deviation of the mtts during the period of analysis santhi et al 2001 3 results 3 1

composition strongly resembled that of precipitation this is because catchment m7 functions as a shallow pounded wetland in which precipitation water rapidly leaves the catchment correa et al 2018

goodness of fit of the objective function was higher than the threshold for model acceptance i e kge 0 45 fig 4 analysis of the mtts estimated for yearly periods using a monthly moving window resulted in 81 model fits per study catchment results of this analysis for catchment m6 are shown in fig 5 for this catchment the average standard deviation value of the mtts were 5 9 1 4 months 175 5 41 7 days kge values of the associated simulations were higher than the threshold for model acceptance ranging between 0 45 and 0 77 fig 5 mtts 4 months and 8 months accounted for 87 6 of the total while 7 4 and 5 0 were higher than 8 months and shorter than 4 months respectively the longest mtts were observed from late 2014 to mid 2015 while the shortest occurred in early 2014 and from mid 2017 until the end of the study period december 2018 fig 5 a similar temporal variability of mtts was observed for the rest of the zeo catchments using the monthly moving window approach see fig s3 in the supplementary material yearly estimated mtts for all study catchments indicate the dominance of short mtts i e 96 of them were shorter than 1 year across the zeo fig 6 a associated with generally acceptable kge values varying between 0 51 0 15 and 0 82 0 05 fig 6b similar to the results using the complete dataset catchments m3 9 3 2 3 or 278 1 68 3 days m4 7 9 2 1 months or 236 6 63 1 days and m5 8 0 1 9 months or 239 9 56 0 days presented the longest mtts fig 6a catchments m1 7 1 2 1 months or 213 2 63 8 days m2 5 3 1 1 months or 159 1 33 9 days m6 5 9 1 4 months or 175 5 41 7 days and m8 5 8 1 3 months or 175 3 37 5 days showed intermediate mtt values the shortest mtts were found at m7 1 8 0 4 months or 52 4 12 1 days 3 3 identification of factors controlling the temporal variability of mtts linear correlation results showed that several hydrometeorological variables were at least acceptably correlated r 0 5 with the yearly estimated mtts for each of the analyzed catchments the subsequent vif multicollinearity analysis identified between 8 and 11 independent variables which could significantly explain the mtt temporal variability in each of the catchments those variables were used to identify the main hydrometeorological factors controlling the temporal variability of mtts through mlr analysis since the presented analysis was carried out using monthly data analysis for catchment m7 which presented very short water mtts 1 2 months could not be pursued as its mtt temporal variability likely depends on antecedent conditions in the order of days or weeks for the rest of the catchments the results of the mlr models fulfilling the conditions for best model selection are shown in table 2 that is the mlr model with the least number of predictive variables fulfilling both criteria for best model selection in terms of error reduction rmse standard deviation of the estimated mtts and goodness of fit r2 adj 0 5 results of the mlr analysis for catchment m6 are shown in fig 7 eight hydrometeorological variables were considered in the mlr models of this catchment after performing the multicollinearity analysis etmin6 qmax0 pcum0 rc7 qmin12 rc12 pcum15 and rc18 these variables were used in the forward criterion mlr to develop and test mlr models with up to 5 variables models a1 to a5 results of the 5 mlr models a1 to a5 are described below and the models equations and coefficients of the predictor variables are shown in fig 7 model a1 included rc12 as the only predictive variable and explained 22 of the dataset variance model a2 included two variables namely rc7 and rc12 and explained 41 of the dataset variability model a3 included 3 variables qmin12 rc7 and rc12 explaining 51 of the variance model a4 included all variables in model a3 and qmax0 explaining 57 of the mtts temporal variation model a5 included all variables in model a4 and pcum0 5 variables in total accounting for 60 of the dataset variability the rmse of the models decreased from 40 49 model a1 to 27 99 model a5 and all predictor variables had a positive relation with the mtts in the mlr models fig 7 model a3 was selected as the one best representing the temporal variability of mtts for catchment m6 as it complied with the aforementioned conditions for model acceptance the same analysis conducted for the remaining catchments indicated that the number of variables necessary to achieve model acceptance conditions for each of them varied between 2 and 5 the models equations and coefficients of the predictor variables are presented in table 2 similar to the results for catchment m6 all predictor variables presented a positive relation with mtts on the mlrs of the rest of the catchments two predictive variables were found for catchments m1 qmd8 and qmin0 15 m2 qmin10 and pcum0 and m3 q300 18 qmd7 the mlr for catchment m4 required 3 predictive variables q300 18 rc9 and qmx7 the models for catchments m5 and m8 required the largest number of predictive variables 4 for m5 qmd12 qcum24 pmx12 and qcum9 and 5 for m8 qmin12 pmd10 pmx9 qmx12 and qcum0 all of these models presented relatively low rmse from 22 60 to 47 98 the models had r2 adj values ranging from 0 50 and 0 58 table 2 indicating that all models explain at least 50 of the mtt temporal variability for each catchment the average aic value among catchments was low suggesting that the selected models are parsimonious results from the f tests show that all models are significant at p 10 9 4 discussion 4 1 mean transit time modelling taking advantage of an 8 year data set from a nested system of tropical andean catchments this study addresses one of the 23 unsolved problems in hydrology blöschl et al 2019 how old is stream water and how do water ages vary in time to this end it is necessary to evaluate the assumptions of the applied mtt modelling approach one limitation of the lca for estimating mtts is the fulfillment of the assumptions of hydrological stationarity i e invariance in time and homogeneity of the studied catchments kirchner 2016a despite the ample temporal variability in hydrological and meteorological conditions observed during the 8 years monitoring period at the zeo fig 2 and s1 the temporal variability of mtts across the catchments was small 191 30 47 10 days contrary to evidence of non stationary conditions in other tropical birkel et al 2016 and non tropical montane catchments peralta tapia et al 2016 this observation supports the hypothesis that the zeo catchments function close to stationary conditions this results from relatively homogeneous landscape characteristics i e vegetation distribution and soil properties topography and geology and low temporal variability of climate conditions correa et al 2018 lazo et al 2019 mosquera et al 2016 this finding also suggests that the zeo catchments meet the steady state assumptions of the lca applied to estimate the presented mtts in addition the fact that the estimated mtts were shorter than the yearly periods applied to investigate mtt temporal variability in this study indicates that our results can be considered reliable and robust as evidenced by the low uncertainty in the modelling results to put our findings in context fig 8 summarizes the temporal variability of mtts and the factors influencing them of different catchments worldwide the mtts at the zeo were shorter than 1 year when modelled using both the complete dataset and yearly periods using a monthly moving window figs 4 and 6 these mtts are consistent with typical values found in pristine catchments of 10 km2 in other regions fig 8 tetzlaff et al 2011 hrachowitz et al 2010 soulsby et al 2006 these values are also similar to prior mtt estimations in the same study area during the period 2011 2014 up to 9 months mosquera et al 2016 these findings support the concept of rapid rainfall runoff dynamics and a minimum contribution of deep groundwater given the compacted underlying geology mosquera et al 2015 a rapid hydrologic response could also be explained by the limited soil depth up to 1 m presenting a porous and open soil structure with a high water storage capacity particularly in the riparian wetlands lazo et al 2019 wetlands are hydrologically connected to slopes especially during wet periods and surface water does not evaporate strongly as humidity remains high throughout the year 90 córdova et al 2015 the short mtts are likely influenced by high soil wetness and increased connectivity of shallow subsurface flow paths birkel et al 2012 rinaldo et al 2011 segura et al 2012 as a consequence the soils remain wet most of the time and their high porosity results in a fast mobilization of water throughout the entire soil profile mosquera et al 2020 allowing for a continuous recharge of riparian wetlands which sustain flow production year round mosquera et al 2015 in another study conducted in the scottish highlands mtt temporal variability was assessed in two small catchments with different features hrachowitz et al 2009 one of the catchments was characterized by low permeable gleyed soils overlying compacted geology the second catchment was dominated by free draining podzolic soils situated on deep extensively fractured bedrock the former presented mtts shorter than 1 year fig 8 135 202 days agreeing well with our results as it presented similar conditions to the zeo and thus a comparable hydrological behavior in which soils that remain close to saturation favor a rapid response of streamflow via the shallow subsurface with minimal contributions of groundwater the latter catchment had much longer mtts 1 830 1 970 days as a result of the dominance of a well mixed groundwater reservoir in the system of bedrock fractures which differs from the situation at the zeo in other environments i e temperate or boreal mtts show a large variability due to groundwater influences in contrast to the zeo where mtts vary little in a study conducted in a temperate zone mtts were estimated using a 1 month moving window with a 10 year data set in five japanese meso catchments ma yamanaka 2013 2016 the average mtt across the catchments was 23 7 years and the temporal variation was similar in the five sub catchments ranging from 1 2 to 37 years contrary to the zeo hydrological system mtts up to few decades reflect a delayed groundwater response and high water storage in the large groundwater reservoir of the japanese catchments in another study in a boreal catchment in sweden mtts ranged from 300 to 1 400 days using a 10 year data set and a monthly moving window peralta tapia et al 2016 these results differed from our study area because of the older groundwater contributions to streamflow and the large temporal changes in stored water due to strong climate seasonality across the year unlike in our study area where the water storage is continuously high due to sustained rainfall inputs throughout the year 4 2 identification of factors controlling temporal variability of mtts the main factors controlling the temporal variability of mtts at the zeo are precipitation streamflow and runoff coefficient table 2 and fig 7 it is reasonable that precipitation is a driver of mtts as it acts as a force that pushes water out of the soil matrix whereas streamflow reflects the system s response to water mobilization i e mixture of precipitation and soil water at the zeo the rapid filling of the soil water reservoir during rainfall events correa et al 2018 and the soil s high water storage capacity lazo et al 2019 result in a year round moist soil system this hydrological status favors the supply of baseflow to streams and supports the shallow water table in páramo areas around the south ecuadorian highlands therefore the occurrence of rapid subsurface flow in the shallow soil layers which remain near saturation explains why the runoff coefficient is a key variable influencing baseflow mtts for these reasons it is not surprising that antecedent conditions of these hydrological variables up to 1 year influence the temporal variability of mtts with the longest antecedent conditions being most important in spring dominated catchments because of their higher water storage capacity lazo et al 2019 similar results to our research were obtained in a boreal catchment in northern sweden fig 8 in that catchment a strong correlation between annually estimated mtts and yearly precipitation was found peralta tapia et al 2016 suggesting that antecedent soil moisture conditions influence mtt estimates in our study area the longest mtts occurred during the least wet periods e g late 2014 to mid 2015characterised by lower than average precipitation and the shortest ones during the wettest periods in which rapid runoff was facilitated by the high saturated hydraulic conductivity of the organic rich soil and the compacted underlying geologic layers mtt variability was also found to be controlled by the amount of precipitation in two zero order catchments in the usa heidbüchel et al 2013 similar to our findings these authors reported that precipitation events during the wettest periods caused the water storage capacity of soils to reach saturation resulting in fast runoff composed of young water in contrast to our findings the amount of stored groundwater was found as a primary control on mtts temporal variation in a temperate meso catchment in japan fig 8 ma yamanaka 2016 these results differ from ours because deep groundwater contributions at the zeo are almost negligible similar to our findings mtts were also found to be correlated with runoff coefficient in a semi arid catchment in southeastern australia cartwright et al 2020 cartwright morgenstern 2015 notwithstanding different processes explain the identified relations in the australian study site and the zeo high evaporation and transpiration rates low precipitation inputs and hence a reduced groundwater recharge rate explain the temporal variability of mtts in the semi arid australian environment differently fairly sustained precipitation inputs padrón et al 2015 and low transpiration rates ochoa sánchez et al 2020 in combination with almost negligible contributions of deep groundwater mosquera et al 2020 mosquera et al 2016 likely explain the relation between mtts and runoff coefficient at the zeo catchments the fact that evapotranspiration was not identified as a driver of the temporal variability of mtts suggests that beyond precipitation local climate has little influence on how water mixes in the subsurface the latter is most likely because of the high air humidity and limited available energy at zeo year round córdova et al 2016 ochoa sánchez et al 2020 this finding is in line with a previous investigation in 20 scottish highland catchments with similar landscape and climate conditions as in our study site hrachowitz et al 2009 however a previous investigation in a tropical catchment in costa rica revealed that wind speed strongly correlates with mtts fig 8 birkel et al 2016 the authors attributed this finding to the fact that local climate is strongly affected by the air masses arriving from different directions pacific coast versus the caribbean sea which in turn influences the temporal variability of subsurface water recharge and storage in contrast our analysis indicates that climate variables did not influence catchment storage and mixing processes most likely because of the year round uniform distribution of precipitation originating preferentially from the east side of the andean mountain range esquivel hernández et al 2019 zhiña et al 2022 the discrepancy might also be due to the difference in the time periods and moving window spans used in both studies while our analysis was conducted using yearly moving window spans i e a complete hydrological cycle over an 8 year period the analysis for the catchment in costa rica was carried out during a short time period 2 years using a 4 months moving window given this it is likely that the variable controlling the mtt variability in costa rica i e wind speed accounts for short term seasonal changes in catchment hydrology differing from the medium long term controls on catchment storage identified in our study these contrasting results highlight the importance of acquiring datasets covering several hydrometeorological cycles for the better understanding of the rainfall runoff processes in tropical regions although there are similarities and differences between the findings of previous studies and ours the combination of streamflow precipitation and runoff coefficient as driving factors of the temporal variability of mtts has not been reported before in the tropics or elsewhere fig 8 this may be due to the strong interplay between precipitation and streamflow which controls subsurface water transport and mixing processes in our study area under the presence of riparian wetlands connected to the stream network and the virtually absent contribution of deep groundwater storage mosquera et al 2015 5 conclusions this study contributes to an improved understanding of the underlying causes of the temporal variability of mtts in remote montane catchments based on this study it can be concluded that mtts in tropical alpine catchments in southern ecuador are shorter than 1 year and demonstrate little temporal variation indicating the prevalence of quasi steady state conditions as a result lumped models represent a useful tool to investigate hydrological dynamics in the region the factors controlling the temporal variability of mtts across the studied catchments are precipitation streamflow and runoff coefficient under different antecedent conditions up to 1 year indicating that runoff generation is dominated by the connectivity of subsurface flow paths through shallow organic soil layers in line with previous conceptualziation of catchment hydrological behavior these results highlight the importance of investigating what drives the temporal variation of mtts as this helps to better understand water flow paths and catchment behavior which is essential to develop appropriate water management and climate adaptation strategies if moisture conditions change shorter mtts can impact nutrient removal and pollutant export changes in water flow paths and catchment behavior caused by changes in climate or land use could also result in variations in the ages of stream water as this study looked at catchments characterised by a natural páramo ecosystem and similar climate conditions future investigations could focus on assessing the temporal variability of mtts and the factors influencing it in catchments with different land use types and constrasting climate further research involving the factors controlling mtts at a larger spatial scale for tropical alpine catchments is also recommended

2379,glaciers of different dimensions respond differently to climate change resulting in variations in glacier dynamics and runoff differentiation of these responses is critical for the karakoram region in context to karakoram anomalies where glaciers contribute significantly to runoff herein the open global glacier model is used to quantify these variabilities in the hunza basin and thereby develop a comprehensive understanding of how glaciers respond to past and future climate change basin glaciers were classified into six classes based on their terminus elevation and area z1 z6 annual mass balance mb time series were reconstructed from 1960 to 2019 the results indicate that the average mb is 0 09 0 21 m w e a 1 which has been accelerated in 2000 s average 0 16 0 20 m w e a 1 cumulative mb between classes varies from 4 55 m w e z1 to 5 92 m w e z3 indicating that the medium classes z3 z4 glaciers mb is comparatively more negative monthly glacier runoff explains the sensitivity of small glaciers to summer temperature as they only contribute to runoff in the summer season however glacier runoff per unit area per year remains almost the same across these groups future climate change scenarios under cmip6 illustrate that small z5 z6 and large z1 glaciers will lose up to 90 and 10 of their volume area and length respectively the results identified that basin glacier runoff will increase till the year 2060 and will start decreasing after that to 2100 projected glacier runoff suggests that the basin runoff is mediated by z4 glaciers whereas the peak water supply from small size glaciers has occurred in past z6 or would occur in near future z5 while large size glaciers z1 z3 runoff keeps on increasing till 2100 these findings indicate that immediate mitigation measures are required to deal with glacier change and ensure long term water security in this region keywords glaciers dynamics climate change oggm terminus elevation glacier runoff data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction being solid reservoirs glaciers not only provide a higher runoff coefficient but glacier meltwater also contributes to and governs the hydrological regime in the dry season by boosting surface runoff gao et al 2021 gao et al 2018 huss 2011 kaser et al 2010 glaciers have changed drastically due to climate change gardelle et al 2012 milner et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 brun et al 2017 consequently there have been significant variations in river hydrology and morphology which are projected to be the greatest of any hydrological system milner et al 2017 however climate change can not entirely explain these changes as individual glaciers and catchments have responded differently to the same climate trend brun et al 2019 sakai 2019 the glaciers diversify in their dimensions typically described by their summit terminus elevation slope areal coverage length etc these diversities cause heterogeneous responses to climate change such as mass accumulation and ablation meanwhile the glacio hydrological processes le meur and vincent 2004 schäfer and le meur 2007 vallot et al 2017 van pelt and kohler 2015 zhen et al 2021 jiskoot et al 2017 superimposed by the spatial and temporal heterogeneities of climatic factors these diversities get even more complicated while studying the impacts of glacier changes on hydrology azam et al 2018 hence raises serious concerns about glacier health and the availability of freshwater immerzeel et al 2010 milner et al 2017 glaciers respond to climate change in two stages static direct and dynamic delayed response warrick and oerlemans 1990 the static response is reflected by glacier mass balance gmb that is directly related to climate change while dynamic response is after effect of cumulative mass balance of many years which can be observed in term of changes in glacier size and meltwater so called delayed response cuffey and paterson 2010 paterson 1994 xu et al 2019 variance in multidecadal averages of individual glaciers indicates that glacier response to climate variability is modulated by its morphological factors huss 2012 huss et al 2013 paul and haeberli 2008 rabatel et al 2016 fischer et al 2015 currently gmb is calculated using glaciological geodetic hydrological and numerical approaches as far as glaciological mass balance mb is concerned only 267 glaciers on the globe have been observed since it is labor intensive expensive provides limited spatial coverage and is often discontinuous zemp et al 2021 in addition glaciological mb indicated balance related to climate without any bias by glacier geometry cox and march 2004 although geodetic estimates can easily identify spatial changes these estimations are often decadal and do not capture inter annual variability bhattacharya et al 2021 geodetic mb on the other hand can vary by several times of actual value if photogrammetric contrast areas and digital elevation model registration are not done well liss and reassen 1999 østrem and haakensen 1999 dynamic characteristic studies reveal that glaciers of similar scale differ greatly in terms of thinning and hence changes in area and volume kingslake et al 2016 melkonian et al 2016 wu et al 2018 wu et al 2019 xiao 2007 snehmani et al 2014 however these changes are associated with factors such as bedrock topography altitudinal distribution meltwater under ice and surface moraine le meur and vincent 2004 schäfer and le meur 2007 vallot et al 2017 jiskoot et al 2017 although remote sensing observations can easily reveal changes in glacial extent over time but it is still unconvincing in the mechanism analysis of glacier response to climate change since there is a delay in glacier dynamic response depending on glacier size and cumulative gmb usually a longer response time for longer glaciers bolch et al 2012 additionally current remote sensing approaches are inadequate to study individual glaciers through remote sensing while morphological factors are the main factor controlling changes in mass balance and dynamical changes salerno et al 2017 numerical modeling is an essential tool that complements metrological and geographical remote sensing data to assess glacier response to climate change on a large temporal and spatial scale still long term mass balance records and the initial state of glaciers are crucial to understanding the synchronicity in glacier response azam et al 2018 davaze et al 2020 although the present mass balance model and degree day model can reveal the accumulation and ablation state of a glacier to some extent these models can still not accurately describe the dynamic characteristics of an individual glacier in response to climate change additionally these numerical models have great difficulty and uncertainty in calculating glacier or region wide mass balance since they are restricted to metrological data and topography factors in the glacier area long et al 2019 a glacio hydrological model which is capable of simulating the morphological dynamics at the basin scale is thus needed greater karakoram in upper indus basin uib has a widespread formation of glaciers due to its high altitude immerzeel et al 2010 tahir et al 2011 studies have reported that 80 of uib river flow is contributed by 20 of its area essentially from the zones of heavy snowfall and glaciers above 3500 m in elevation which is mainly occupied by karakoram glaciers hewitt 2011 hewitt et al 1989 wake 1989 within the karakoram region hunza basin central karakoram serves as an indispensable water resource for uib where 33 80 6 of total basin runoff is composed of glacier meltwater ali et al 2018 lutz et al 2014 shrestha and nepal 2019 previous studies have demonstrated that glaciers in this region have displayed unusual behaviors as compared to the surrounding region i e glacier are expanding stable and retreating within same region dimri 2021 hewitt and development 2005 however these analyses are based on satellite imagery which is subjected to regional glacier dynamics and exhibits delayed response while in literature runoff contribution from glacierized area is calculated using glacio hydrological models these models can t entirely explain the hydrologic role of glaciers as it is also based on intensity and amount of precipitation besides melting so they cannot give an exact contribution of glacier runoff cannon et al 2014 2016 lutz et al 2016 shrestha et al 2015 based on above debate the present study aims to reconstruct the annual mass balance series of hunza basin glaciers and evaluate glacier dynamics and runoff in response to climate change based on their area and terminus elevation we implement the open global glacier model oggm to undertake our study the oggm can simulate the glacio hydrological processes while taking account of their morphological changes under climate change this model applies a new ice thickness inversion procedure physically consistent with flow line representations to explicitly simulate glacier dynamics in conjunction with calibrated mass balance model its glacier runoff is the sum of all melt and rainwater that exits the glacierized area thus the objectives of this study are 1 to investigate how the glaciers of different sizes respond differently to climate change and impact the runoff 2 to differentiate the effects of glacier dimensions and find the most sensitive and effective dimension group and 3 to predict variations in glaciers and runoff and tipping point peak water timing for the hunza river basin hrb upper indus river 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area hrb in central karakoram fig 1 is chosen as the benchmark because of high heterogeneity of glaciers response in comparison to the surrounding regions gao et al 2020 quincey and luckman 2014 with a total area of 13 734 km2 the hrb is the main glaciated region of central karakoram with a glacier area ratio of 31 calculated from randolph glacier inventory rgi v6 consortium 2017 the hrb hosts the karakoram region s largest glaciers such as hispar batura yazgil virjerab barpu pasu and khurdophin glaciers these glaciers make up the most extensive glacier system in hrb the glacier s elevation ranges between 2270 and 7799 meter above sea level masl while the basin elevation curve varies between 1394 m asl and 7885 m asl two major wind systems westerlies and asian monsoon control the climate system of this region minora et al 2016 the westerlies bring maximum precipitation in winter as snow and generate extreme flow in summer due to snow and glacier melt atif et al 2018 most likely more than 50 of water in the indus river comes from snow and glacier melt in the karakoram immerzeel et al 2010 soncini et al 2015 the hrb itself provides greater than 12 of the total flow into the indus river system irs upstream of the tarbela dam from which 80 of water comes from snow and glaciated areas atif et al 2018 2 2 data 2 2 1 climate the dataset climate research unit timeseries cru ts v4 harris et al 2020 is used for the calibration of model as well as for historical simulations for the period of 1960 2019 the cru dataset has a spatial resolution of 0 5 latitude by 0 5 longitude it is further downscaled to a resolution of 10 by applying the 1961 1990 anomalies to the cru cl v2 0 gridded climatology new et al 2002 the downscaled cru contains altitude information and can be used to calculate the temperature at a specific height on the glacier for each glacier the monthly temperature and precipitation time series are extracted from the nearest cru ts v4 grid point and then converted to the local temperature according to a temperature gradient default 6 5 k km 1 oggm applies a precipitation correction factor p f to the original cru precipitation time series to account for the elevational effects this precipitation correction factor p f 2 5 can be seen as a global correction for orographic precipitation avalanches and wind blown snow we also used climate data from the community earth system model last millennium ensemble cesm lme to grow up glaciers spinup to an initial state in oggm

and validating the simulated gmb when the in situ observations are not available andreassen et al 2016 jóhannesson et al 2013 kronenberg et al 2016 in this paper geodetic mass balance data of six glaciers located inside hrb is collected from published research for parameterizing the model bolch et al 2017 meanwhile the regional geodetic balance data for the hrb from other literature is also collected and compiled for evaluating the simulated mass balance at the basin scale bolch et al 2017 gardelle et al 2013 muhammad et al 2019 brun et al 2017 kääb et al 2015 2 2 3 spatial data the glacier outlines of the rgi v6 which was released in 2017 and distributed by the global land ice measurements from space glims are used for initial topographical processing in the model consortium 2017 the nasadem with one arc second resolution freely available through the land processes distributed active archive center lp daac through nasa earth data is downloaded and interpolated to the local grid depending on glacier location and outline buckley et al 2022 nasadem is a modernization of dem and an associated product from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm data which relied on ice cloud and land elevation satellite icesat geoscience laser altimeter system glas ground control points of its lidar shots to improve surface elevation measurements that led to improved geolocation accuracy ice thickness distribution of glacier ice is estimated using the ice inversion module in oggm by adjusting ice parameters the deformation parameter glen a and a siding parameter fs which control glacier thickness and glacier volume here we used the consensus estimate for ice thickness calculated globally to calibrate inverted calculated volume of glaciers and to find best parameters farinotti et al 2019 farinotti et al 2019 used the results of the ice thickness models intercomparison experiments itmix and combined five ice thickness estimation models to get an estimate of the 215 000 glaciers in rgi v6 all those models derive the ice thickness distribution from surface characteristics such as elevation and slope glacier mass continuity and ice flow dynamics 2 3 classification of the glaciers by their dimensions glacier dimensions are important factors affecting glacier response to climate change to account for glacier dimensions area terminus elevation influence on glacier changes basin glaciers were divided into six groups with each class corresponding to a different terminus elevation and glacier area range these groups are named z1 z2 z3 z4 z5 and z6 the z1 group contains the lowest terminus elevation class but the largest area glaciers while the z6 contains glaciers with the highest terminus elevations and smallest glaciers in basin the other groups are in between the general attributes of z1 z6 are presented in table 1 and depicted in fig 1 in table 1 glacier summit elevation gse represents the maximum elevation of a set of glaciers in the zn group gse is highest for types z1 z2 and z3 which implies that z1 z2 and z3 have the longest and most giant glaciers which have the highest gse value but lowest terminus elevation furthermore lower terminus elevation glaciers group occupy a large area and volume concentration in the basin in the oggm model monthly temperature for each glacier is extracted from the nearest cru cl v4 0 grid point and converted to local temperature according to a temperature gradient as a result the temperature is not linearly decreasing or increasing from z1 to z6 as larger glaciers terminus may fall into a lower elevation range but most of their glacier extents fall in higher elevation zones however temperature gradient strongly affects melting processing in all these regions see section 3 3 2 4 oggm parameterization and simulation schemes 2 4 1 parameterization oggm is used in this study to simulate the glacier dynamics and glacio hydrological processes oggm is a modular and open source numerical model framework capable of simulating glacier mass balance ice thickness estimation and dynamics maussion et al 2019 oggm is the first global model which can explicitly simulate glacier dynamics the model relies on the shallow ice approximation to compute the depth integrated flux of ice along multiple flowlines in this study we used updated oggm version 1 5 which can also simulate glacier runoff in two components rainfall runoff and melt runoff at monthly and yearly time steps model performance in the first ice thickness models intercomparison experiment itmix ranked it among the best models with limited data requirements farinotti et al 2017 moreover oggm comes at a reasonable computational cost several dozen glaciers can be simulated on a personal computer oggm developers claim that the model can accurately simulate all global glaciers available in rgi v6 even without extensive calibration however in this study we did parametrization to calibrate mass balance and ice volume using data from literature bolch et al 2017 farinotti et al 2019 a brief introduction to the workflow is described in section 1 of supplementary information mass balance module in oggm is the extended version of the temperature index model developed by marzeion et al 2012 downscaled gridded precipitation and temperature data interpolated to the glacier location are required to calibrate the temperature index model the glacier mass balance at each flowlines grid point for any month in the past is computed as 1 m i p f p i solid z μ max t i z t melt 0 ε where p f is global precipitation correction factor p f 2 5 p i s o l i d is solid precipitation μ is glacier temperature sensitivity factor and need to calibrate t i is air temperature t m e l t is the temperature at which ice melt occurs in this study t m e l t is set to 0 c so the amount of solid precipitation is expressed as a percentage of total precipitation a hundred percent solid if t i t s o l i d 0 c zero percent if t i t l i q u i d 2 c and linearly interpolated in between oggm mass balance model does not include explicit terms for refreezing and runoff sink any contribution of refreezing to the glacier s mass balance can be assumed to be incorporated during the calibration process of µ in mass balance model of oggm calibration procedure of µ can be find in maussion et al 2019 gmb observations are crucial for understanding regional hydrology mountain meteorology and glacier contributions to runoff and sea level changes garg et al 2021 zemp et al 2013 in oggm mass balance calibration is essential because the model computes the ice thickness of glaciers based on the principle of mass conservation and ice dynamics though oggm can automatically calibrate mass balance by interpolating mass balance of ten nearest glaciers for which observed mass balance is available from the world glacier monitoring service wgms 2021 unfortunately in hrb no observation data is available in thewgms dataset and neighboring glaciers are located in different climatic zones with different geometries which would result in a less accurate calibration for hrb glaciers for mass balance calibration six out of seven glaciers with available geodetic mass balance were selected for performing calibration manually the seventh glacier khurdopin was excluded due to model flowline error gmb for these seven glaciers was calculated from hexagon kh 9 aster and srtm dem for the period 1973 to 2009 bolch et al 2017 these calibrated glaciers with their parameters are added to default database with other wgms glaciers in the data directory for further processing details of these six glaciers are given in table s2 following this all other glaciers in hrb were automatically calibrated for this paper glaciers were investigated by the classified groups z1 to z6 as described previously therefore average mass balance was calculated for each group and mean annual surface mass balance of overall hrb was reconstructed from averages of these groups from 1960 to 2019 and were evaluated against the estimated regional geodetic mass balance data from literature bolch et al 2017 gardelle et al 2013 muhammad et al 2019 brun et al 2017 kääb et al 2015 we used graphical techniques to evaluate the model s performance of gmb simulation next parameterization was done for the ice thickness inversion module which calculates the ice thickness along the flowlines and then converts it to glacier volume we again utilize literature based ice thickness and calculated volume data for the calibration farinotti et al 2019 due to the unavailability of the field measurements the calibration process indicates that the inversion parameter glen a is dependent on the glacier area 2 4 2 simulation schemes the parameterized oggm was used to simulate glacier mass balance based on downscaled cru ts v4 after mass balance calibration spinup runs were drive using cesm lme under different scenarios and set of parameters to grow glacier to its initial state to simulate historical changes consequently optimal spinup outputs were used to simulate past and future glacier dynamics as volume area and length changes in hrb ultimately oggm hydrological task named run with hydro was applied to compute glacier runoff glacier runoff outputs in oggm are computed on the largest possible area that was covered by the glacier ice during simulation period which replicate a fixed gauge station some distance downstream the terminus of the glacier simulated glacier runoff consist of four components melt on area melt off area rainfall on glacier and rainfall off glacier on area melt is sum of ice melt and seasonal snow melt while off area melt is melting generating from snow bucket which store seasonal snow and provide off area melt in summer season from non glacier the total glacier runoff is calculated using eq 2 2 q α p liquid α on α off p on liquid p off liquid thus α is made up of ice melt on the glacier and snow melt both on and off the glacier similarly p liquid comes from both on and off glacier area technically α and p liquid are computed retroactively from the mass balance model eq 1 retroactive to simulate glacier runoff based on glacier maximum extent and to ensure that the total runoff is not bigger than the yearly volume change holmgren 2022 the model applies mass conservation law to calculate glacier runoff components rainfall and melt runoff hence maintaining mass conservation in the dynamical model do not need any additional calibration of hydro module in oggm 3 results and discussion 3 1 oggm calibration and validation 3 1 1 mass balance comparisons of the simulated versus literature mass balance for six glaciers and the hunza basin are depicted by fig 2 a g the simulation results indicate that the glacier batura ranks the highest mass loss followed by glaciers hispar virjerab barpu yazgil and pasu the mass loss accelerated since 1980 especially for the glaciers large in area the average mass balance of glacier batura in the first period 1961 1980 was 0 074 m w e a 1 while in the last period 2001 2019 it was 0 15 m w e a 1 almost doubled in the hrb mass balance was 0 16 m w e a 1 in 2001 2019 which is more than double of 0 07 m w e a 1 in 1961 1980 fig 2g exceptionally some glaciers did not show obvious change in the 1981 2000 in the hrb e g the six typical glaciers presented in table s3 their average mass balance change during 1981 2000 was found negligible the simulated gmb was averaged over hrb and validated against data compiled from previous studies through remote sensing images in 1961 2019 the simulated gmb was 0 09 m w e a 1 in 1973 2009 it was 0 08 m w e a 1 which is pretty close to the 0 06 m w e a 1 in the same period by bolch et al 2017 in 1999 2000 2016 it was 0 16 m w e a 1 indicating a faster mass than the 0 09 m w e a 1 given by brun et al 2017 the variation in gmb between 2000 and 2010 2011 based on varied density assumption varied between 0 05 to 0 11 m w e a 1 representing stable or gain in mass balance in hrb muhammad et al 2019 while the calculated average of hrb during 2000 2010 is 0 12 m w e a 1 likewise a slight negative mass balance comparable to our results was also presented by wu et al 2020 and kääb et al 2015 that is 0 04 0 02 w e a 1 during 2000 2014 and 0 03 m w e a 1 during 2003 2008 which is 0 16 and 0 10 m w e a 1 respectively for this study another study about regional geodetic mass balance revealed a mass loss of 0 06 0 04 m w e a 1 in karokaram kääb et al 2012 while our result for the same period is 0 10 0 09 m w e a 1 generally our simulations results are very similar to that from previous studies implying the acceptance of the simulating approaches the differences among them might be due to the uncertainties of the remote sensing data data processing techniques and the modelling approaches as advised by liss and reassen 1999 østrem and haakensen 1999 geodetic mass balance can vary by several times of actual value if photogrammetric contrast areas and digital elevation model registration are not done well 3 1 2 regional area volume oggm can performs spinup to drive an initial glacier state we used climate data from cesm s last millennium ensemble from 1801 to 2000 to run the spinups key parameters affecting glacier dynamics are 1 inversion glen a parameter 2 temperature bias and 3 initial model year the spinups cesm lme and historical cru ts runs were performed consecutively using different combinations of parameters to achieve optimal results these parameters were calibrated for each class to match calculated oggm ice volume estimates computed from consensus estimates from farinotti et al 2019 glacier area was matched with rgi v6 glacier area but in rgi data different glaciers are having different rgi year hence glacier area comparisons for each group and total glacier area in zn group are based on rgi median year 1998 1999 model spinup were drive for last 200 years 1801 2000 with different spinup scenario and climate bias to grow glaciers in each group separately results from spinup with optimal initial state were then provided as geometrical input with an optimal initial year and glen a parameter to perform historical simulation such that simulated area and volume match with rgi area and farinotti et al 2019 estimates respectively comparisons between calculated and published estimates of volume area for the individual glacier as well as total volume area for zn group are presented in fig 3 pearson s correlation r and coefficient of determination r2 indicators was used to evaluate the comparison for individual glaciers with in a group all groups showed a good match for volume area estimations with an r2 value of 0 99 except for region z6 group for which the r2 value is 0 85 for the volume estimates and 0 80 for the area estimates the low value for z6 addresses that the glen a parameter is very important for volume calibration as z6 contains glaciers of different geometrical characteristics so the same value of glen a does not fit all the glaciers in z6 3 2 historical simulations and glaciers responses based on their dimensions 1960 2019 3 2 1 glacier mass balance basin widely the glaciers show negative trends of mass balance fig 4 d in 1960 2019 the glaciers lose mass in 40 years and gain mass in remaining 20 years the basin wide mass balance varied in 0 49 0 57 m w e a 1 with an average of 0 09 0 01 m w e a 1 cumulatively the glaciers lost mass by 5 11 m w e in 1960 2019 the year 1996 showed the maximum gain in mass balance 0 57 0 17 m w e a 1 while the maximum mass loss 0 49 0 08 m w e a 1 occurred in 2008 between different classes since 2001 the average temperature in the basin has gone up by 0 75 0 06 c which had a big effect on the type of precipitation reaching the glacier surface as a result the mass balance from 2001 to 2019 is 0 16 0 21 m w e a 1 different glacier groups show mass balance differently this is caused by the combined effects of climate factors as snowfall and temperature and the morphologic factors of glaciers as termination elevation and extend we performed statistical analysis of the relationships among glacier mass balance and the influential factors described the results in detail in fig s3 the gmb has a significant correlation with snowfall and a significant negative correlation with temperature for all glaciers for the whole basin correlation coefficient r values between gmb and snowfall are above 0 90 and correlation is highly significant with a p value 0 001 melting is positively correlated with temperature thus it can be found that for the glaciers in groups z1 to z6 the termination elevation goes up and the extend decreases the glacier in groups z1 and z2 gain the less amount of snowfall than that in the groups z5 and z6 fig 4b the temperature over the glaciers in groups z1 z2 is usually higher than that over the glaciers in groups z5 and z6 this explains why the glaciers in groups z1 and z2 generally showed more significant negative mass balance however it is noticed that the glaciers in groups z3 and z4 showed the most significant negative mass balance this is because of hypsometry parameters which influence glacier mass budget such as summit and terminus elevation mass loss of the glaciers in z1 and z2 are usually more than that in groups z3 and z4 however the mass gain of glaciers in z1 and z2 are more than that in z3 and z4 due to their longer extension 3 2 2 glacier dynamics 1960 2019 glacier dynamics for hrb are simulated as glacier volume area and length which were derived using optimized oggm the tabulated volume area and length for each elevation class were computed annually to estimate dynamical changes in the past relative changes in glacier dynamics for each group with respect to year 1960 are reconstructed in fig 5 a f the findings exhibit that glaciers were constantly changing in volume area and length in response to climate change however percent change trends are different between the groups and obviously within the group due to the heterogeneity of glaciers geometry within each category these groups showed gains and losses in glacier mass during different periods percentage changes suggest that the glacier size reduction is higher in higher elevations which is substantially controlled by glacier area the highest loss in glacier percentage happens for the z6 glacier group followed by z5 z4 z3 z2 and z1 in total hrb lost 25 58 km3 7 of volume in last 60 years and remaining total volume of the hunza glacier in 2019 is 335 12 km3 which was 360 70 km3 in 1960 and 348 25 km3 in 2000 quantitative volume loss is higher for z2 z4 and z1 groups sum of which is 19 6 km3 during the study period hunza glacier area losses are relatively lower than the total volume loses which suggest thinning of hrb glaciers total area loss in the last 60 years is only 3 5 the total glacier area in 2019 is reduced to 4004 9 km2 which was 4149 km2 in 1960 chronological patternfor relative changes among different classes ascribe the effect of glacier hypsometry in term of glacier dynamical response however quantity wise glacier area loss was highest for groups z4 z5 and z2 fig 5c and d the graphs below elucidate significant length variations in glacier length throughout the historical period fig 5e and f similar to volume area relative percentage changes in length followed chronological pattern whereas length changes are more significant for group z5 glacier then followed by z4 z3 z2 z1 and z6 group z6 glacier are initially smaller in geometry therefore didn t show much quantitate variations in graph frames with other groups the cumulative sum of all the glaciers concludes that 285 km of the glaciers have disappeared and present total glaciers length in hrb is 3509 km estimated numerical values for the years 1960 1981 2001 and 2019 are given in table s4 and quantity loss in glacial ice in terms of volume area and length during different decades are tabulated in table s5 sharp spikes in fig 5a f indicates a sudden increase or decrease in glacier geometry these sudden changes may lead by high snowfall in those years as the current version of model cannot differentiate between snow and ice so occasional years with large snowfall can artificially increase the glacier volume area length for example in 1996 all glaciers gained size due to a high positive mass balance of 0 6 m a 1 in the basin additionally the higher elevation groups show more high spikes suggesting those glaciers are getting more snowfall there but sensitivity of higher glacier to summer temperature results in faster melting of available seasonal snow there which brings the glaciers to normal size in next years of simulation 3 2 3 glacier runoff 1960 2019 monthly and yearly variation in runoff was analyzed based on cru historical data the hydro task was employed for this purpose and monthly and yearly outputs were generated for each glacier group which then summed up to calculate hrb glacier runoff and its components in current study calculated on area and off area hydrological variables are classified into two components melt and rainfall runoff assuming that off area contribution during each study period historical and future is not much significant and do not need a separate presentation in results 3 2 3 1 monthly changes in glacier runoff melt and rainfall runoff within all months varies significant across different elevation ranges or glacier groups the amount of liquid precipitation received is highest for glaciers with lower terminus elevation while it is lowest and nearly zero mm per unit area in cold and dry months for glaciers with higher terminus elevations or glaciers in high elevation zones z4 z5 and z6 specifically the months from november to april did not show a significant amount of rainfall received by z4 z5 and z6 glaciers hence the rainfall runoff contribution from these glaciers is zero during those months fig 6 a we also examined the snowfall patterns to derive regional trends and to better understand hypsometry relationship with snowfall accumulation and its impact on melt runoff fig s4 depicts snowfall behavior for sub groups throughout the year indicating that glaciers receive maximum snowfall between december and may on average 358 231 65 mm of snow the same monthly trends were observed for glaciers in sikkim himalayas singh et al 2021 calculated snowfall thickness in each group shows that group z1 gets the highest snowfall even though these glaciers have the lowest terminus elevation but there their areal extent is spread even higher the z6 group elevations at the same time z2 z6 glaciers groups showed similar trends for snowfall depth throughout the year except few months may june and september fig 5b represents melt produced by ice and snow revealing that melt runoff significantly varies among z1 to z6 glaciers in different months on average z1 is linked to the highest melt per unit area and z6 generate the lowest melt during all months excluding july and august melting pattern for groups z4 z6 during is similar to their rainfall runoff pattern concluding that overall glacier runoff from these three groups z4 z6 is zero during these seven months october april contrastingly z1 group is generating glacier runoff continuously in every month the highest runoff from the z1 glacier corresponds to the highest snowfall amount they receive in their accumulation zone that is located at high elevation as well as glacier melting located at lower elevation meanwhile z5 and z6 glaciers didn t respond significantly to temperature in most of the month but the response was markable during july and august when z6 glacier melt is highest compared to all other glaciers it reveals that glaciers in higher elevations accumulate snow in other months and melt when the temperature gets higher than their threshold level as argued by singh the temperature lapse rate is also the cause of delay in melting at higher elevations and earlier at lower elevations singh et al 2021 as a result snow and ice stored at higher elevations responded slower than snow accumulated at lower elevations these results are also in line with the previous study in hrb which demonstrate that small glacier retreat faster and retreat rate is related to the warming trend in summer temperature qureshi et al 2017 it is also important to consider the snow depth in the melting process in areas where the snow depth is higher the critical range of temperatures will be lower than in areas where the snow depth is lower adnan et al 2019 weissling and ackley 2016 accordingly the melt produced from z2 to z6 relates to the snowfall thickness received by those glaciers the greater the snowfall mm thickness the lesser melting except for july and august in hrb average monthly liquid precipitation melt and percentage of their contribution reveal that the contribution from rainfall and melt runoff from groups z4 z6 is zero during november to april maximum melt and liquid precipitation runoff mt occur during july and august the similar estimations were reported ali et al 2018 based on hbv model hrb basin wide trends demonstrate that melt runoff contribution from october to march did not contribute much melt to the hunza streams even the melt and overall glacier runoff was nearly zero during december january and february fig s6 because the temperature during these months is below the melting temperature adjusted during model simulations similar trends in monthly glacier runoff in hrb were also demonstrated by shafeeque 2020 and shrestha and nepal 2019 and shafeeque 2020 and shrestha and nepal 2019 3 2 3 2 annual changes in glacier runoff both melt and rainfall runoff components graphs showed clear increasing trend during the historical period except for z1 glacier melt runoff which showed a gradually declining trend in recent decades 2000 2019 fig 7 results also show temporal variations among each group differently in melting for example maximum melt for glaciers z5 and z6 occurred in 1973 while for z2 z3 and z4 maximum melt occurred in 2007 and 2008 the minimum melt was perceived in 1989 for all glaciers except z1 and z4 where minimum melting occurred in 2017 and 1972 respectively to estimate interdecadal changes in runoff due to climate change the historical period was divided into three groups 1960 1980 1960s 1981 2000 1980s and 2001 2019 2000s interdecadal analyses were also performed for mb snowfall and temperature the results of these analyses illustrate that liquid precipitation and temperature increased throughout the study period however mass balance solid precipitation and melt trends were different fig s5 the less negative mass balance an increase in solid precipitation and less melting in 1980s was noticed as compared to 1960s and 2000s because of significant warming across whole basin during 2000s glacier runoff increased noticeably to 4163 mt which was 3830 6 and 3766 8 mt in 1960s and 1980s the total average contribution from melt and rainfall to total glacier runoff for each class during different decades as well as the percentage contribution of runoff to the total hunza glacier runoff is given in table s6 the meltwater contribution to total glacier runoff is decreasing while rainfall runoff contribution is increasing combined total glacier runoff was highest in 2000s and lowest in 1980s the decrease in total glacier runoff during the 1980s could be attributed to a favorable glacier climate that resulted in more snowfall and stable mass balance during those years 3 2 3 3 oggm hydro task evaluation calculated annual glacier runoff were evaluated using observed and published streamflow data to assess oggm simulation performance according to discharge data from the surface water hydrology project of the water and power development authority swhp wapda for the last 45 years 1966 2010 the mean annual discharge at hrb outlet danyore gauging station is 10186 11 mt yr 1 323 m3s 1 tahir et al 2011 meanwhile oggm simulated glacier runoff during the same period is 3875 1 313 7 mt yr 1 123 9 9 m3s 1 from which 2999 4 242 1 mt yr 1 95 1 7 7 m3s 1 is meltwater hence calculated melt and glacier runoff are 29 44 and 38 08 of observed streamflow respectively estimated glacier melt contribution based on water and energy balance distributed biosphere hydrological model web dhm s during years 2002 to 2004 varied in range of 31 to 36 of total streamflow for the study area shrestha et al 2015 whereas the predicted melt using oggm is 94 6 m3s 1 2984 05 mt yr 1 during the same period which is 34 33 of observed discharge in same manner shafeeque 2020 calculated annual glacier runoff contribution to hrb runoff for years 2002 2007 using spatial processes in hydrology sphy which was 38 of the total basin runoff while it was higher as 60 of total basin runoff based on j2000 model shrestha and nepal 2019 mukhopadhyay and khan 2014 results based on analytical method reveal that glacier and snow melt from the whole basin contribute 74 in contrast snow and ice melt based on modified positive degree day model mpddm components contribute 38 73 to the total hrb streamflow ali et al 2017 while spatial processes in hydrology sphy model estimates determine that snow and glacier melt contribute 90 2 80 6 9 6 lutz et al 2014 while estimated snow and glacier melt based on web dhm s contribution to total runoff is 83 50 33 comparable results of our study with the estimates of enhanced model physics and model with upgraded snow and ice inbuilt modules confirm better agreement of glacier runoff component calculated using oggm in contrast to other models estimates mpddm computed snow and ice melt runoff contribution in hrb is quite lower similar behavior of mpddm toward snow and ice melt contribution were also reported in adjacent shigar and gilgit river basin srb grb hassan et al 2021 quantify that snow and ice melt contribute 32 based on mpddm and 86 based on the glacio hydrological degree day model gdm likewise semi distributed altitude belts based temperature index model calculated a 72 contribution of snow and ice melt in srb soncini et al 2015 consonantly in grb mpddm reproduced runoff show that snow and ice melt contribution is 26 ali et al 2017 unlikeness snow and glacier melt contributions predicted by snowmelt runoff model srm model is 78 adnan et al 2017 similarly estimated contribution of snow and ice melt is 90 based on sphy model latif et al 2020 78 based on srm model latif et al 2020 68 based on analytical approach in separation of flow components mukhopadhyay and khan 2014 and 80 2 again based on sphy model lutz et al 2014 different model results illustrate that predicted melt runoff percentage differ substantially within the same basin although the inconsistencies are driven by differences in replication of basin topography distribution of melt characteristics and fundamental differences in model structure in fact significant higher melt contribution in above basins may be ascribed by larger glacier coverage and snow reserves present in basins whereas mpddm underestimate melt contribution for all three basins which is due to semi distributed structure of the model physics which does not reflect the heterogeneity in landcover and melt characteristic although the variation in snow and ice melt rate induces topo climatic variables within the same altitude belt hassan et al 2021 the spatial distribution of model parameters and updated physical and dynamical modules can considerably enhance model computing efficiency further increased contribution of snow ice melt must be validated by glaciological or hydro chemical isotopic investigations 3 3 differentiating the response and impacts of glacier dimensions in future hunza glacier responses to future climate change and their impact on future glacio hydrology were modeled under projections of thirteen gcms and their four shared socioeconomic pathways scenarios ssp126 ssp245 ssp370 and ssp585 3 3 1 future glacier dynamics 2021 2100 the future climate impact differently on different glacier groups based on glacier terminus elevation and area significant changes are predicted for z5 and z6 glaciers which will lose 75 6 97 15 of their volume 65 0 93 8 of their area and 75 6 92 9 of their length by the end of this century the maximum ice mass loss from these groups z5 and z6 is generally attributed to smaller glacier areas and more sensitivity of these glaciers toward high summer temperatures which melt glaciers at a higher rate than those with a larger continuous mass loss was noticed for all glaciers except z1 glaciers where a minor increase in volume was detected in some years under ssp126 ensembles it is also important to mention that all the ensembles showed a similar impact on glacier dynamics area and length here during the first 20 years 2021 2040 while dispersing behavior in the last 20 years 2081 2100 glacier dynamic changes show relatively significant volume loss in future under all gcms and scenarios except a few although dynamical changes in term of percentage contrast highly in term of actual ice mass loss among groups calculated percentage changes in glacier storage in terms of volume area and length indicate that glaciers of smaller size would lose a higher percentage as compared to larger size glaciers fig 8 figs s18 s20 but in terms of magnitude of volume area length highest volume losses occurred for classes z4 z2 and z3 40 6 39 6 23 8 km3 and lowest for z6 z1 and z5 0 2 11 8 12 0 km3 classes fig s15 similarly in terms of area losses z4 z5 and z2 classes lost 558 6 291 6 160 4 km2 of area while z6 z1 and z3 lost about 10 8 92 9 148 4 km2 fig s16 meanwhile loss in length was high for z4 z5 and z3 869 3 791 9 189 1 km and low for z2 z1 and z6 93 69 and 55 km respectively fig s17 estimated projected future glacier volume area length for hrb glaciers and their changes w r t to 2019 2020 under future ensembles are provided in table s7 and figs s6 s13 furthermore projections applies that the large size glaciers though lose more area however undergo a lesser amount of percentage area loss at the same time this relationship is comparable to the one obtained from central and western himalayas garg et al 2017 shukla et al 2020 in contrast small glaciers with small glacier areas and lower thickness are more prone to climate warming and could demonstrate faster terminus retreat rate as compared to larger thicker glaciers zhen et al 2021 additionally many previous studies at the global level have reported vulnerability of small glaciers to climate change due to small accumulation areas correspondingly reflecting negative mass balance huss and farinotti 2012 huss and fischer 2016 small glaciers also showed higher area change rates in qilian mountains where small glaciers 1km2 glaciers even lost more than 90 of glacier area and number of small glaciers 0 1 km2 increased in basin as many other middle size glaciers are retreating he et al 2019 a prediction on small glaciers 1km2 in tien shan has also shown that continuous future warming will melt away all the small glaciers which will affect the stability of runoff from more to less in basin he et al 2019 overall basin results reveal that glaciers volume area and length are likely to decrease by 38 11 45 31 85 11 34 and 58 9 13 34 under the average of all ensembled scenarios gcms the minimum volume loss was computed under cams csm1 0 among all gcms while maximum loss was projected under ec earth3 however maximum changes in glacier dynamics are predicted under ssp585 while minimum for ssp126 among other scenarios similar behavior has also been projected for other high mountain glaciers in the surrounding regions shafeeque and luo 2021 khadka et al 2020 for interdecadal analysis at basin scale and for glaciers group we selected the 2040s 2041 2060 and the 2080s 2081 2100 as future periods and we compared them with the past changes in the 2000s 2001 2019 based on decadal analysis groups z1 z4 volume loss are higher than past decades except for ssp126 scenario comparatively less volume loss for z1 glaciers is happening in the future under most gcms and scenarios even an in increase in z1 glaciers volume is estimated under ssp126 ensembles of cams csm1 0 and mpi esm1 2 hr during 2040s for z5 and z6 glaciers volume area length losses in 2080s is lesser than the volume loss in 2040s because many of these small glaciers will disappear after the mid twentieth century and completely melt until 2100 comparatively higher projected mass loss in future is caused by snowfall amount which is projected to decrease due to warmer climate accumulation decreased and ablation increased however snowfall decrease is more significant for glaciers in high elevation followed by lower elevation minimum reduction in snowfall percentage is computed for z1 glaciers a total of 3 8 6 6 and 6 1 11 7 decrease is projected in hunza basin during 2040s and 2080s respectively on average basin total volume lost in 2000s was 14 1 km3 while the projected average loss ranges from 26 7 to 38 5 km3 during 2040s and 16 5 to 41 1 km3 in 2080s fig s34 overall average for future period showed that interdecadal projected volume loss km3 is also higher than the past period 2000s the maximum predicted volume loss occurs under ec earthh3 585 that is 64 65 km3 during 2040s and 54 97 km3 in 2080s for whole hunza basin however length and area showed consistent decreasing trends for each class 3 3 2 future changes in glacier runoff one of the important objectives of this study is to project future glacio hydrology of hrb contributed by glaciers and to estimate basin peak glacier runoff annual glacier meltwater and rainfall runoff were projected and analyzed under forced ensembles to explore the water storage availability in the future analysis showed different runoff and meltwater contributions under different ensembles and for glacier groups average of all gcm under different scenarios illustrate that future glacier runoff in hrb will decrease under future climate different groups peak time is expected to occur at different time however the basin peak runoff is projected to occur around 2060 year that is fairly comparable with the peaks of z4 group runoff projected yearly glacier runoff melt and rainfall runoff for each class and the whole hunza basin is depicted in fig 9 based on an average of 13 gcms future glacier runoff keep increasing for z1 z2 and z3 classes while for z4 z5 and z6 classes glaciers runoff showed decreasing trends after 2058 2013 and 2023 respectively the decrease or increase pattern of glacier runoff in different classes could relate to the number of glaciers glacier area and volume for example z1 class of glaciers contains only 12 glaciers but covers an area of 967 7 km2 avg 80 64 km2 and 23 glaciers in z2 class occupy a total area of 1097 km2 avg 48 69 km2 while for z4 class 719 glaciers cover 1016 6 km2 avg 1 413 km2 of total basin area and for z5 class 1118 glaciers covers a total area of 388 5 km2 avg 0 35 km2 besides these the glacier in z1 and z2 class store the highest volume of ice and they are the thickest glacier in the basin which can produce more and more melt for a longer period depending on climate change at the same time the small glacier z5 and z6 will melt and disappear in the next few decades as also predicted for small glaciers of other regions that these small glaciers will melt away and less runoff will be available in future period he et al 2019 cai et al 2022 such as glacier shrinkage and reached glacier tipping point showed depletion in streamflow of lidder valley kashmir himalayas correspondingly having serious implications on future water supply marazi and romshoo 2018 to estimate interdecadal changes in the past and future potential changes in hydrologic variables are compared for the periods of 2000s 2040s and 2080s the relative changes were estimated based on 2000s these periods indicate start middle and end of the 21st century to get a general overview of how snowfall volume loss gain relate to runoff relate with each other s these variables are merged into single graph for presentation figs s28 s34 group z1 glaciers showed a decrease in meltwater amount forced by ssp126 under all gcms except bcc csm2 mr 15 1 ec earth3 39 1 and ec earth3 veg 1 2 during 2040s and even more decrease under all gcms except ec earth3 veg 3 during 2080s under ssp245 the average changes are negligible during both decades for all models whereas the ssp370 and ssp585 based scenarios indicate significant increase in meltwater in the coming years the z2 glaciers rank number one in the hunza basin in terms of area mean area of 47 7km2 volume and rainfall runoff and ranked at number second in terms of meltwater availability after z1 and showed a relatively greater increase in melt percentage based on all the scenarios and gcms increasing trends from past to future are observed for z2 glaciers except for few ensembles under ssp126 and ssp245 scenarios group z3 also behaved similarly to z2 and for both groups peak melt will occur in 2080s excluding ssp126 projection which shows peak melt in the 2040s cynosure results were obtained for z4 z5 and z6 groups based on the results maximum meltwater of z4 would be available in late year of 2040s2040s while for z5 maximum melt is expected in early years of 2020s for z6 glaciers the gradual decrease in meltwater is projected the z5 glaciers contain 1118 glaciers with glacier areas ranging from 0 02 12 4 km2 to get good results from the ice thickness model this group was further divided into 1 with area greater than 0 3 km2 and 2 with area 0 3 km2 area and the model was calibrated separately for each class simulated results for each class and each ensemble are attached in the supplementary file fig s11 and s12 results of z5 0 3 m2 and z6 both revealed that smaller glaciers would melt and disappear and their future meltwater is less than in the past indicating that their tipping point has already passed in 2000s as per past results a similar finding was reported for small glacier by huss and hock 2018 the change in percentage for z6 total runoff ranged from 29 95 6 8 2040 s and 45 45 23 75 during 2080s rainfall runoff trends for all glacier groups and hrb were almost similar in which all showed increasing trends throughout the future period except for fewer ensembles scenarios projections table s7 large variations in basin runoff have been observed during the 21st century based on selected models the total hrb glacier runoff is projected to increase under all ssps except for ssp126 and ssp245 of cams csm1 0 relative to historical runoff table s7 the average total runoff of hunza basin in 2000s was 4163 mt yr 1 3193 mt yr 1 of melt and 972 8 mt yr 1 of rainfall under ensembled scenarios of all gcms average total runoff is projected to increases by 15 4 3 9 and 2 2 2 2 ssp126 18 3 8 and 14 6 2 6 ssp245 22 4 4 1 and 31 3 ssp370 and 28 8 4 7 and 40 7 3 4 ssp585 during 2040 s and 2080 s the average of all gcms under ssp126 explicates that peak runoff will occur around year 2040 under ssp245 peak year is 2052 wherease the average runoff under ssp370 and ssp585 scenarios project a continuous increase until years around 2070s the cams csm1 0 reported a minimum increase or minor decrease in total runoff melt and rainfall among all other gcms while bcc csm2 mr ec earth3 veg and ec earth3 represent a drastic increase in total runoff moreover the runoff components trends are different under different future scenarios overall analysis results reveal that melt and rainfall runoff both are project to increase percentage changes in melt ranges are 6 3 53 4 and 8 8 15 1 ssp126 2 5 47 8 and 3 8 26 8 ssp245 4 1 57 3 and 12 3 46 9 ssp370 and 8 2 66 2 and 16 7 43 9 during 2040s and 2080s respectively fig 9b similarly the rainfall runoff changes ranges are 12 7 55 4 and 17 9 40 4 ssp126 21 6 36 8 and 3 4 76 8 ssp245 11 0 57 7 and 4 3 105 4 ssp370 and 4 3 54 6 and 2 6 149 2 during 2040s and 2080s respectively fig 9c as per average of all projections hrb meltwater will be maximum around 2060 and decline during 2080s under ssp126 ssp245 while an insignificant increase is projected under ssp370 and ssp585 the decrease in future melt runoff after 2040s is attributed to the total volume or number of glaciers which will decrease in future the amount of liquid precipitation is increasing throughout the future percentage change for the whole basin relative to 2001 2019 is given in table s7 rainfall changes are more prominent for ssp370 and ssp585 the average increase is 12 6 and 47 1 for ssp370 and 17 7 and 68 5 for ssp585 this study results also justify previous results claiming that streamflow in the basin will increase ali et al 2018 atif et al 2019 singh et al 2021 4 conclusion we applied the oggm model to examine how glaciers with different dimensions respond to climate change in the hunza basin as no in situ glaciological data is available thus we calibrated the model with published glaciological and hydrological data the model satisfactorily reproduced annual mass balance glacier dynamics and runoff demonstrating the model s applicability to the study catchment moreover we used thirteen cmip6 models under four ssps to predict glacier dynamic response and its impacts on future glacier runoff results indicate glacier terminus elevation and area play a dominant role in controlling glaciological and hydrological responses for glaciers with higher terminus elevations z4 z6 the flow regime occurs exclusively from june to september only larger glaciers with low terminus elevation and high heads z1 flow year round mass loss was higher for class z3 and z4 glaciers hence temporal evaluation reveals that mass wastage is more in 2001 2019 0 16 m w e a 1 and less in 1981 2000 0 04 m w e a 1 though retreat and shrinkage rates for higher terminus elevation small glaciers were significantly higher 91 5 of volume and lower for the lower terminus elevation large glaciers 11 21 of volume results illustrate that different gcms and scenarios result in large uncertainty while predicting the annual variations however on average hunza basin glaciers would lose 128 km3 38 2 1266 km2 31 6 and 2067 9 km 58 94 of their volume area and length by the end of 21st century according to the results glacier runoff accounted for 39 80 of total basin runoff in the past to assess the glacier impact on glacio hydrology we predict the tipping point for each class findings suggest that melt runoff will increase for larger glaciers while it will decrease for smaller glaciers demonstrating that smaller glaciers are at high risk of extinction meanwhile peak melt runoff for medium class z4 glaciers will occur between 2040 and 2060 similar trends have been found for the entire hunza basin glacier runoff the model results of this work however may be accompanied by uncertainties which arise mostly due to lack of in situ data for model efficiency tests therefore a thoughtful approach should be taken to the results to ensure long term water security in this region

2379,glaciers of different dimensions respond differently to climate change resulting in variations in glacier dynamics and runoff differentiation of these responses is critical for the karakoram region in context to karakoram anomalies where glaciers contribute significantly to runoff herein the open global glacier model is used to quantify these variabilities in the hunza basin and thereby develop a comprehensive understanding of how glaciers respond to past and future climate change basin glaciers were classified into six classes based on their terminus elevation and area z1 z6 annual mass balance mb time series were reconstructed from 1960 to 2019 the results indicate that the average mb is 0 09 0 21 m w e a 1 which has been accelerated in 2000 s average 0 16 0 20 m w e a 1 cumulative mb between classes varies from 4 55 m w e z1 to 5 92 m w e z3 indicating that the medium classes z3 z4 glaciers mb is comparatively more negative monthly glacier runoff explains the sensitivity of small glaciers to summer temperature as they only contribute to runoff in the summer season however glacier runoff per unit area per year remains almost the same across these groups future climate change scenarios under cmip6 illustrate that small z5 z6 and large z1 glaciers will lose up to 90 and 10 of their volume area and length respectively the results identified that basin glacier runoff will increase till the year 2060 and will start decreasing after that to 2100 projected glacier runoff suggests that the basin runoff is mediated by z4 glaciers whereas the peak water supply from small size glaciers has occurred in past z6 or would occur in near future z5 while large size glaciers z1 z3 runoff keeps on increasing till 2100 these findings indicate that immediate mitigation measures are required to deal with glacier change and ensure long term water security in this region keywords glaciers dynamics climate change oggm terminus elevation glacier runoff data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction being solid reservoirs glaciers not only provide a higher runoff coefficient but glacier meltwater also contributes to and governs the hydrological regime in the dry season by boosting surface runoff gao et al 2021 gao et al 2018 huss 2011 kaser et al 2010 glaciers have changed drastically due to climate change gardelle et al 2012 milner et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 brun et al 2017 consequently there have been significant variations in river hydrology and morphology which are projected to be the greatest of any hydrological system milner et al 2017 however climate change can not entirely explain these changes as individual glaciers and catchments have responded differently to the same climate trend brun et al 2019 sakai 2019 the glaciers diversify in their dimensions typically described by their summit terminus elevation slope areal coverage length etc these diversities cause heterogeneous responses to climate change such as mass accumulation and ablation meanwhile the glacio hydrological processes le meur and vincent 2004 schäfer and le meur 2007 vallot et al 2017 van pelt and kohler 2015 zhen et al 2021 jiskoot et al 2017 superimposed by the spatial and temporal heterogeneities of climatic factors these diversities get even more complicated while studying the impacts of glacier changes on hydrology azam et al 2018 hence raises serious concerns about glacier health and the availability of freshwater immerzeel et al 2010 milner et al 2017 glaciers respond to climate change in two stages static direct and dynamic delayed response warrick and oerlemans 1990 the static response is reflected by glacier mass balance gmb that is directly related to climate change while dynamic response is after effect of cumulative mass balance of many years which can be observed in term of changes in glacier size and meltwater so called delayed response cuffey and paterson 2010 paterson 1994 xu et al 2019 variance in multidecadal averages of individual glaciers indicates that glacier response to climate variability is modulated by its morphological factors huss 2012 huss et al 2013 paul and haeberli 2008 rabatel et al 2016 fischer et al 2015 currently gmb is calculated using glaciological geodetic hydrological and numerical approaches as far as glaciological mass balance mb is concerned only 267 glaciers on the globe have been observed since it is labor intensive expensive provides limited spatial coverage and is often discontinuous zemp et al 2021 in addition glaciological mb indicated balance related to climate without any bias by glacier geometry cox and march 2004 although geodetic estimates can easily identify spatial changes these estimations are often decadal and do not capture inter annual variability bhattacharya et al 2021 geodetic mb on the other hand can vary by several times of actual value if photogrammetric contrast areas and digital elevation model registration are not done well liss and reassen 1999 østrem and haakensen 1999 dynamic characteristic studies reveal that glaciers of similar scale differ greatly in terms of thinning and hence changes in area and volume kingslake et al 2016 melkonian et al 2016 wu et al 2018 wu et al 2019 xiao 2007 snehmani et al 2014 however these changes are associated with factors such as bedrock topography altitudinal distribution meltwater under ice and surface moraine le meur and vincent 2004 schäfer and le meur 2007 vallot et al 2017 jiskoot et al 2017 although remote sensing observations can easily reveal changes in glacial extent over time but it is still unconvincing in the mechanism analysis of glacier response to climate change since there is a delay in glacier dynamic response depending on glacier size and cumulative gmb usually a longer response time for longer glaciers bolch et al 2012 additionally current remote sensing approaches are inadequate to study individual glaciers through remote sensing while morphological factors are the main factor controlling changes in mass balance and dynamical changes salerno et al 2017 numerical modeling is an essential tool that complements metrological and geographical remote sensing data to assess glacier response to climate change on a large temporal and spatial scale still long term mass balance records and the initial state of glaciers are crucial to understanding the synchronicity in glacier response azam et al 2018 davaze et al 2020 although the present mass balance model and degree day model can reveal the accumulation and ablation state of a glacier to some extent these models can still not accurately describe the dynamic characteristics of an individual glacier in response to climate change additionally these numerical models have great difficulty and uncertainty in calculating glacier or region wide mass balance since they are restricted to metrological data and topography factors in the glacier area long et al 2019 a glacio hydrological model which is capable of simulating the morphological dynamics at the basin scale is thus needed greater karakoram in upper indus basin uib has a widespread formation of glaciers due to its high altitude immerzeel et al 2010 tahir et al 2011 studies have reported that 80 of uib river flow is contributed by 20 of its area essentially from the zones of heavy snowfall and glaciers above 3500 m in elevation which is mainly occupied by karakoram glaciers hewitt 2011 hewitt et al 1989 wake 1989 within the karakoram region hunza basin central karakoram serves as an indispensable water resource for uib where 33 80 6 of total basin runoff is composed of glacier meltwater ali et al 2018 lutz et al 2014 shrestha and nepal 2019 previous studies have demonstrated that glaciers in this region have displayed unusual behaviors as compared to the surrounding region i e glacier are expanding stable and retreating within same region dimri 2021 hewitt and development 2005 however these analyses are based on satellite imagery which is subjected to regional glacier dynamics and exhibits delayed response while in literature runoff contribution from glacierized area is calculated using glacio hydrological models these models can t entirely explain the hydrologic role of glaciers as it is also based on intensity and amount of precipitation besides melting so they cannot give an exact contribution of glacier runoff cannon et al 2014 2016 lutz et al 2016 shrestha et al 2015 based on above debate the present study aims to reconstruct the annual mass balance series of hunza basin glaciers and evaluate glacier dynamics and runoff in response to climate change based on their area and terminus elevation we implement the open global glacier model oggm to undertake our study the oggm can simulate the glacio hydrological processes while taking account of their morphological changes under climate change this model applies a new ice thickness inversion procedure physically consistent with flow line representations to explicitly simulate glacier dynamics in conjunction with calibrated mass balance model its glacier runoff is the sum of all melt and rainwater that exits the glacierized area thus the objectives of this study are 1 to investigate how the glaciers of different sizes respond differently to climate change and impact the runoff 2 to differentiate the effects of glacier dimensions and find the most sensitive and effective dimension group and 3 to predict variations in glaciers and runoff and tipping point peak water timing for the hunza river basin hrb upper indus river 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area hrb in central karakoram fig 1 is chosen as the benchmark because of high heterogeneity of glaciers response in comparison to the surrounding regions gao et al 2020 quincey and luckman 2014 with a total area of 13 734 km2 the hrb is the main glaciated region of central karakoram with a glacier area ratio of 31 calculated from randolph glacier inventory rgi v6 consortium 2017 the hrb hosts the karakoram region s largest glaciers such as hispar batura yazgil virjerab barpu pasu and khurdophin glaciers these glaciers make up the most extensive glacier system in hrb the glacier s elevation ranges between 2270 and 7799 meter above sea level masl while the basin elevation curve varies between 1394 m asl and 7885 m asl two major wind systems westerlies and asian monsoon control the climate system of this region minora et al 2016 the westerlies bring maximum precipitation in winter as snow and generate extreme flow in summer due to snow and glacier melt atif et al 2018 most likely more than 50 of water in the indus river comes from snow and glacier melt in the karakoram immerzeel et al 2010 soncini et al 2015 the hrb itself provides greater than 12 of the total flow into the indus river system irs upstream of the tarbela dam from which 80 of water comes from snow and glaciated areas atif et al 2018 2 2 data 2 2 1 climate the dataset climate research unit timeseries cru ts v4 harris et al 2020 is used for the calibration of model as well as for historical simulations for the period of 1960 2019 the cru dataset has a spatial resolution of 0 5 latitude by 0 5 longitude it is further downscaled to a resolution of 10 by applying the 1961 1990 anomalies to the cru cl v2 0 gridded climatology new et al 2002 the downscaled cru contains altitude information and can be used to calculate the temperature at a specific height on the glacier for each glacier the monthly temperature and precipitation time series are extracted from the nearest cru ts v4 grid point and then converted to the local temperature according to a temperature gradient default 6 5 k km 1 oggm applies a precipitation correction factor p f to the original cru precipitation time series to account for the elevational effects this precipitation correction factor p f 2 5 can be seen as a global correction for orographic precipitation avalanches and wind blown snow we also used climate data from the community earth system model last millennium ensemble cesm lme to grow up glaciers spinup to an initial state in oggm

and validating the simulated gmb when the in situ observations are not available andreassen et al 2016 jóhannesson et al 2013 kronenberg et al 2016 in this paper geodetic mass balance data of six glaciers located inside hrb is collected from published research for parameterizing the model bolch et al 2017 meanwhile the regional geodetic balance data for the hrb from other literature is also collected and compiled for evaluating the simulated mass balance at the basin scale bolch et al 2017 gardelle et al 2013 muhammad et al 2019 brun et al 2017 kääb et al 2015 2 2 3 spatial data the glacier outlines of the rgi v6 which was released in 2017 and distributed by the global land ice measurements from space glims are used for initial topographical processing in the model consortium 2017 the nasadem with one arc second resolution freely available through the land processes distributed active archive center lp daac through nasa earth data is downloaded and interpolated to the local grid depending on glacier location and outline buckley et al 2022 nasadem is a modernization of dem and an associated product from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm data which relied on ice cloud and land elevation satellite icesat geoscience laser altimeter system glas ground control points of its lidar shots to improve surface elevation measurements that led to improved geolocation accuracy ice thickness distribution of glacier ice is estimated using the ice inversion module in oggm by adjusting ice parameters the deformation parameter glen a and a siding parameter fs which control glacier thickness and glacier volume here we used the consensus estimate for ice thickness calculated globally to calibrate inverted calculated volume of glaciers and to find best parameters farinotti et al 2019 farinotti et al 2019 used the results of the ice thickness models intercomparison experiments itmix and combined five ice thickness estimation models to get an estimate of the 215 000 glaciers in rgi v6 all those models derive the ice thickness distribution from surface characteristics such as elevation and slope glacier mass continuity and ice flow dynamics 2 3 classification of the glaciers by their dimensions glacier dimensions are important factors affecting glacier response to climate change to account for glacier dimensions area terminus elevation influence on glacier changes basin glaciers were divided into six groups with each class corresponding to a different terminus elevation and glacier area range these groups are named z1 z2 z3 z4 z5 and z6 the z1 group contains the lowest terminus elevation class but the largest area glaciers while the z6 contains glaciers with the highest terminus elevations and smallest glaciers in basin the other groups are in between the general attributes of z1 z6 are presented in table 1 and depicted in fig 1 in table 1 glacier summit elevation gse represents the maximum elevation of a set of glaciers in the zn group gse is highest for types z1 z2 and z3 which implies that z1 z2 and z3 have the longest and most giant glaciers which have the highest gse value but lowest terminus elevation furthermore lower terminus elevation glaciers group occupy a large area and volume concentration in the basin in the oggm model monthly temperature for each glacier is extracted from the nearest cru cl v4 0 grid point and converted to local temperature according to a temperature gradient as a result the temperature is not linearly decreasing or increasing from z1 to z6 as larger glaciers terminus may fall into a lower elevation range but most of their glacier extents fall in higher elevation zones however temperature gradient strongly affects melting processing in all these regions see section 3 3 2 4 oggm parameterization and simulation schemes 2 4 1 parameterization oggm is used in this study to simulate the glacier dynamics and glacio hydrological processes oggm is a modular and open source numerical model framework capable of simulating glacier mass balance ice thickness estimation and dynamics maussion et al 2019 oggm is the first global model which can explicitly simulate glacier dynamics the model relies on the shallow ice approximation to compute the depth integrated flux of ice along multiple flowlines in this study we used updated oggm version 1 5 which can also simulate glacier runoff in two components rainfall runoff and melt runoff at monthly and yearly time steps model performance in the first ice thickness models intercomparison experiment itmix ranked it among the best models with limited data requirements farinotti et al 2017 moreover oggm comes at a reasonable computational cost several dozen glaciers can be simulated on a personal computer oggm developers claim that the model can accurately simulate all global glaciers available in rgi v6 even without extensive calibration however in this study we did parametrization to calibrate mass balance and ice volume using data from literature bolch et al 2017 farinotti et al 2019 a brief introduction to the workflow is described in section 1 of supplementary information mass balance module in oggm is the extended version of the temperature index model developed by marzeion et al 2012 downscaled gridded precipitation and temperature data interpolated to the glacier location are required to calibrate the temperature index model the glacier mass balance at each flowlines grid point for any month in the past is computed as 1 m i p f p i solid z μ max t i z t melt 0 ε where p f is global precipitation correction factor p f 2 5 p i s o l i d is solid precipitation μ is glacier temperature sensitivity factor and need to calibrate t i is air temperature t m e l t is the temperature at which ice melt occurs in this study t m e l t is set to 0 c so the amount of solid precipitation is expressed as a percentage of total precipitation a hundred percent solid if t i t s o l i d 0 c zero percent if t i t l i q u i d 2 c and linearly interpolated in between oggm mass balance model does not include explicit terms for refreezing and runoff sink any contribution of refreezing to the glacier s mass balance can be assumed to be incorporated during the calibration process of µ in mass balance model of oggm calibration procedure of µ can be find in maussion et al 2019 gmb observations are crucial for understanding regional hydrology mountain meteorology and glacier contributions to runoff and sea level changes garg et al 2021 zemp et al 2013 in oggm mass balance calibration is essential because the model computes the ice thickness of glaciers based on the principle of mass conservation and ice dynamics though oggm can automatically calibrate mass balance by interpolating mass balance of ten nearest glaciers for which observed mass balance is available from the world glacier monitoring service wgms 2021 unfortunately in hrb no observation data is available in thewgms dataset and neighboring glaciers are located in different climatic zones with different geometries which would result in a less accurate calibration for hrb glaciers for mass balance calibration six out of seven glaciers with available geodetic mass balance were selected for performing calibration manually the seventh glacier khurdopin was excluded due to model flowline error gmb for these seven glaciers was calculated from hexagon kh 9 aster and srtm dem for the period 1973 to 2009 bolch et al 2017 these calibrated glaciers with their parameters are added to default database with other wgms glaciers in the data directory for further processing details of these six glaciers are given in table s2 following this all other glaciers in hrb were automatically calibrated for this paper glaciers were investigated by the classified groups z1 to z6 as described previously therefore average mass balance was calculated for each group and mean annual surface mass balance of overall hrb was reconstructed from averages of these groups from 1960 to 2019 and were evaluated against the estimated regional geodetic mass balance data from literature bolch et al 2017 gardelle et al 2013 muhammad et al 2019 brun et al 2017 kääb et al 2015 we used graphical techniques to evaluate the model s performance of gmb simulation next parameterization was done for the ice thickness inversion module which calculates the ice thickness along the flowlines and then converts it to glacier volume we again utilize literature based ice thickness and calculated volume data for the calibration farinotti et al 2019 due to the unavailability of the field measurements the calibration process indicates that the inversion parameter glen a is dependent on the glacier area 2 4 2 simulation schemes the parameterized oggm was used to simulate glacier mass balance based on downscaled cru ts v4 after mass balance calibration spinup runs were drive using cesm lme under different scenarios and set of parameters to grow glacier to its initial state to simulate historical changes consequently optimal spinup outputs were used to simulate past and future glacier dynamics as volume area and length changes in hrb ultimately oggm hydrological task named run with hydro was applied to compute glacier runoff glacier runoff outputs in oggm are computed on the largest possible area that was covered by the glacier ice during simulation period which replicate a fixed gauge station some distance downstream the terminus of the glacier simulated glacier runoff consist of four components melt on area melt off area rainfall on glacier and rainfall off glacier on area melt is sum of ice melt and seasonal snow melt while off area melt is melting generating from snow bucket which store seasonal snow and provide off area melt in summer season from non glacier the total glacier runoff is calculated using eq 2 2 q α p liquid α on α off p on liquid p off liquid thus α is made up of ice melt on the glacier and snow melt both on and off the glacier similarly p liquid comes from both on and off glacier area technically α and p liquid are computed retroactively from the mass balance model eq 1 retroactive to simulate glacier runoff based on glacier maximum extent and to ensure that the total runoff is not bigger than the yearly volume change holmgren 2022 the model applies mass conservation law to calculate glacier runoff components rainfall and melt runoff hence maintaining mass conservation in the dynamical model do not need any additional calibration of hydro module in oggm 3 results and discussion 3 1 oggm calibration and validation 3 1 1 mass balance comparisons of the simulated versus literature mass balance for six glaciers and the hunza basin are depicted by fig 2 a g the simulation results indicate that the glacier batura ranks the highest mass loss followed by glaciers hispar virjerab barpu yazgil and pasu the mass loss accelerated since 1980 especially for the glaciers large in area the average mass balance of glacier batura in the first period 1961 1980 was 0 074 m w e a 1 while in the last period 2001 2019 it was 0 15 m w e a 1 almost doubled in the hrb mass balance was 0 16 m w e a 1 in 2001 2019 which is more than double of 0 07 m w e a 1 in 1961 1980 fig 2g exceptionally some glaciers did not show obvious change in the 1981 2000 in the hrb e g the six typical glaciers presented in table s3 their average mass balance change during 1981 2000 was found negligible the simulated gmb was averaged over hrb and validated against data compiled from previous studies through remote sensing images in 1961 2019 the simulated gmb was 0 09 m w e a 1 in 1973 2009 it was 0 08 m w e a 1 which is pretty close to the 0 06 m w e a 1 in the same period by bolch et al 2017 in 1999 2000 2016 it was 0 16 m w e a 1 indicating a faster mass than the 0 09 m w e a 1 given by brun et al 2017 the variation in gmb between 2000 and 2010 2011 based on varied density assumption varied between 0 05 to 0 11 m w e a 1 representing stable or gain in mass balance in hrb muhammad et al 2019 while the calculated average of hrb during 2000 2010 is 0 12 m w e a 1 likewise a slight negative mass balance comparable to our results was also presented by wu et al 2020 and kääb et al 2015 that is 0 04 0 02 w e a 1 during 2000 2014 and 0 03 m w e a 1 during 2003 2008 which is 0 16 and 0 10 m w e a 1 respectively for this study another study about regional geodetic mass balance revealed a mass loss of 0 06 0 04 m w e a 1 in karokaram kääb et al 2012 while our result for the same period is 0 10 0 09 m w e a 1 generally our simulations results are very similar to that from previous studies implying the acceptance of the simulating approaches the differences among them might be due to the uncertainties of the remote sensing data data processing techniques and the modelling approaches as advised by liss and reassen 1999 østrem and haakensen 1999 geodetic mass balance can vary by several times of actual value if photogrammetric contrast areas and digital elevation model registration are not done well 3 1 2 regional area volume oggm can performs spinup to drive an initial glacier state we used climate data from cesm s last millennium ensemble from 1801 to 2000 to run the spinups key parameters affecting glacier dynamics are 1 inversion glen a parameter 2 temperature bias and 3 initial model year the spinups cesm lme and historical cru ts runs were performed consecutively using different combinations of parameters to achieve optimal results these parameters were calibrated for each class to match calculated oggm ice volume estimates computed from consensus estimates from farinotti et al 2019 glacier area was matched with rgi v6 glacier area but in rgi data different glaciers are having different rgi year hence glacier area comparisons for each group and total glacier area in zn group are based on rgi median year 1998 1999 model spinup were drive for last 200 years 1801 2000 with different spinup scenario and climate bias to grow glaciers in each group separately results from spinup with optimal initial state were then provided as geometrical input with an optimal initial year and glen a parameter to perform historical simulation such that simulated area and volume match with rgi area and farinotti et al 2019 estimates respectively comparisons between calculated and published estimates of volume area for the individual glacier as well as total volume area for zn group are presented in fig 3 pearson s correlation r and coefficient of determination r2 indicators was used to evaluate the comparison for individual glaciers with in a group all groups showed a good match for volume area estimations with an r2 value of 0 99 except for region z6 group for which the r2 value is 0 85 for the volume estimates and 0 80 for the area estimates the low value for z6 addresses that the glen a parameter is very important for volume calibration as z6 contains glaciers of different geometrical characteristics so the same value of glen a does not fit all the glaciers in z6 3 2 historical simulations and glaciers responses based on their dimensions 1960 2019 3 2 1 glacier mass balance basin widely the glaciers show negative trends of mass balance fig 4 d in 1960 2019 the glaciers lose mass in 40 years and gain mass in remaining 20 years the basin wide mass balance varied in 0 49 0 57 m w e a 1 with an average of 0 09 0 01 m w e a 1 cumulatively the glaciers lost mass by 5 11 m w e in 1960 2019 the year 1996 showed the maximum gain in mass balance 0 57 0 17 m w e a 1 while the maximum mass loss 0 49 0 08 m w e a 1 occurred in 2008 between different classes since 2001 the average temperature in the basin has gone up by 0 75 0 06 c which had a big effect on the type of precipitation reaching the glacier surface as a result the mass balance from 2001 to 2019 is 0 16 0 21 m w e a 1 different glacier groups show mass balance differently this is caused by the combined effects of climate factors as snowfall and temperature and the morphologic factors of glaciers as termination elevation and extend we performed statistical analysis of the relationships among glacier mass balance and the influential factors described the results in detail in fig s3 the gmb has a significant correlation with snowfall and a significant negative correlation with temperature for all glaciers for the whole basin correlation coefficient r values between gmb and snowfall are above 0 90 and correlation is highly significant with a p value 0 001 melting is positively correlated with temperature thus it can be found that for the glaciers in groups z1 to z6 the termination elevation goes up and the extend decreases the glacier in groups z1 and z2 gain the less amount of snowfall than that in the groups z5 and z6 fig 4b the temperature over the glaciers in groups z1 z2 is usually higher than that over the glaciers in groups z5 and z6 this explains why the glaciers in groups z1 and z2 generally showed more significant negative mass balance however it is noticed that the glaciers in groups z3 and z4 showed the most significant negative mass balance this is because of hypsometry parameters which influence glacier mass budget such as summit and terminus elevation mass loss of the glaciers in z1 and z2 are usually more than that in groups z3 and z4 however the mass gain of glaciers in z1 and z2 are more than that in z3 and z4 due to their longer extension 3 2 2 glacier dynamics 1960 2019 glacier dynamics for hrb are simulated as glacier volume area and length which were derived using optimized oggm the tabulated volume area and length for each elevation class were computed annually to estimate dynamical changes in the past relative changes in glacier dynamics for each group with respect to year 1960 are reconstructed in fig 5 a f the findings exhibit that glaciers were constantly changing in volume area and length in response to climate change however percent change trends are different between the groups and obviously within the group due to the heterogeneity of glaciers geometry within each category these groups showed gains and losses in glacier mass during different periods percentage changes suggest that the glacier size reduction is higher in higher elevations which is substantially controlled by glacier area the highest loss in glacier percentage happens for the z6 glacier group followed by z5 z4 z3 z2 and z1 in total hrb lost 25 58 km3 7 of volume in last 60 years and remaining total volume of the hunza glacier in 2019 is 335 12 km3 which was 360 70 km3 in 1960 and 348 25 km3 in 2000 quantitative volume loss is higher for z2 z4 and z1 groups sum of which is 19 6 km3 during the study period hunza glacier area losses are relatively lower than the total volume loses which suggest thinning of hrb glaciers total area loss in the last 60 years is only 3 5 the total glacier area in 2019 is reduced to 4004 9 km2 which was 4149 km2 in 1960 chronological patternfor relative changes among different classes ascribe the effect of glacier hypsometry in term of glacier dynamical response however quantity wise glacier area loss was highest for groups z4 z5 and z2 fig 5c and d the graphs below elucidate significant length variations in glacier length throughout the historical period fig 5e and f similar to volume area relative percentage changes in length followed chronological pattern whereas length changes are more significant for group z5 glacier then followed by z4 z3 z2 z1 and z6 group z6 glacier are initially smaller in geometry therefore didn t show much quantitate variations in graph frames with other groups the cumulative sum of all the glaciers concludes that 285 km of the glaciers have disappeared and present total glaciers length in hrb is 3509 km estimated numerical values for the years 1960 1981 2001 and 2019 are given in table s4 and quantity loss in glacial ice in terms of volume area and length during different decades are tabulated in table s5 sharp spikes in fig 5a f indicates a sudden increase or decrease in glacier geometry these sudden changes may lead by high snowfall in those years as the current version of model cannot differentiate between snow and ice so occasional years with large snowfall can artificially increase the glacier volume area length for example in 1996 all glaciers gained size due to a high positive mass balance of 0 6 m a 1 in the basin additionally the higher elevation groups show more high spikes suggesting those glaciers are getting more snowfall there but sensitivity of higher glacier to summer temperature results in faster melting of available seasonal snow there which brings the glaciers to normal size in next years of simulation 3 2 3 glacier runoff 1960 2019 monthly and yearly variation in runoff was analyzed based on cru historical data the hydro task was employed for this purpose and monthly and yearly outputs were generated for each glacier group which then summed up to calculate hrb glacier runoff and its components in current study calculated on area and off area hydrological variables are classified into two components melt and rainfall runoff assuming that off area contribution during each study period historical and future is not much significant and do not need a separate presentation in results 3 2 3 1 monthly changes in glacier runoff melt and rainfall runoff within all months varies significant across different elevation ranges or glacier groups the amount of liquid precipitation received is highest for glaciers with lower terminus elevation while it is lowest and nearly zero mm per unit area in cold and dry months for glaciers with higher terminus elevations or glaciers in high elevation zones z4 z5 and z6 specifically the months from november to april did not show a significant amount of rainfall received by z4 z5 and z6 glaciers hence the rainfall runoff contribution from these glaciers is zero during those months fig 6 a we also examined the snowfall patterns to derive regional trends and to better understand hypsometry relationship with snowfall accumulation and its impact on melt runoff fig s4 depicts snowfall behavior for sub groups throughout the year indicating that glaciers receive maximum snowfall between december and may on average 358 231 65 mm of snow the same monthly trends were observed for glaciers in sikkim himalayas singh et al 2021 calculated snowfall thickness in each group shows that group z1 gets the highest snowfall even though these glaciers have the lowest terminus elevation but there their areal extent is spread even higher the z6 group elevations at the same time z2 z6 glaciers groups showed similar trends for snowfall depth throughout the year except few months may june and september fig 5b represents melt produced by ice and snow revealing that melt runoff significantly varies among z1 to z6 glaciers in different months on average z1 is linked to the highest melt per unit area and z6 generate the lowest melt during all months excluding july and august melting pattern for groups z4 z6 during is similar to their rainfall runoff pattern concluding that overall glacier runoff from these three groups z4 z6 is zero during these seven months october april contrastingly z1 group is generating glacier runoff continuously in every month the highest runoff from the z1 glacier corresponds to the highest snowfall amount they receive in their accumulation zone that is located at high elevation as well as glacier melting located at lower elevation meanwhile z5 and z6 glaciers didn t respond significantly to temperature in most of the month but the response was markable during july and august when z6 glacier melt is highest compared to all other glaciers it reveals that glaciers in higher elevations accumulate snow in other months and melt when the temperature gets higher than their threshold level as argued by singh the temperature lapse rate is also the cause of delay in melting at higher elevations and earlier at lower elevations singh et al 2021 as a result snow and ice stored at higher elevations responded slower than snow accumulated at lower elevations these results are also in line with the previous study in hrb which demonstrate that small glacier retreat faster and retreat rate is related to the warming trend in summer temperature qureshi et al 2017 it is also important to consider the snow depth in the melting process in areas where the snow depth is higher the critical range of temperatures will be lower than in areas where the snow depth is lower adnan et al 2019 weissling and ackley 2016 accordingly the melt produced from z2 to z6 relates to the snowfall thickness received by those glaciers the greater the snowfall mm thickness the lesser melting except for july and august in hrb average monthly liquid precipitation melt and percentage of their contribution reveal that the contribution from rainfall and melt runoff from groups z4 z6 is zero during november to april maximum melt and liquid precipitation runoff mt occur during july and august the similar estimations were reported ali et al 2018 based on hbv model hrb basin wide trends demonstrate that melt runoff contribution from october to march did not contribute much melt to the hunza streams even the melt and overall glacier runoff was nearly zero during december january and february fig s6 because the temperature during these months is below the melting temperature adjusted during model simulations similar trends in monthly glacier runoff in hrb were also demonstrated by shafeeque 2020 and shrestha and nepal 2019 and shafeeque 2020 and shrestha and nepal 2019 3 2 3 2 annual changes in glacier runoff both melt and rainfall runoff components graphs showed clear increasing trend during the historical period except for z1 glacier melt runoff which showed a gradually declining trend in recent decades 2000 2019 fig 7 results also show temporal variations among each group differently in melting for example maximum melt for glaciers z5 and z6 occurred in 1973 while for z2 z3 and z4 maximum melt occurred in 2007 and 2008 the minimum melt was perceived in 1989 for all glaciers except z1 and z4 where minimum melting occurred in 2017 and 1972 respectively to estimate interdecadal changes in runoff due to climate change the historical period was divided into three groups 1960 1980 1960s 1981 2000 1980s and 2001 2019 2000s interdecadal analyses were also performed for mb snowfall and temperature the results of these analyses illustrate that liquid precipitation and temperature increased throughout the study period however mass balance solid precipitation and melt trends were different fig s5 the less negative mass balance an increase in solid precipitation and less melting in 1980s was noticed as compared to 1960s and 2000s because of significant warming across whole basin during 2000s glacier runoff increased noticeably to 4163 mt which was 3830 6 and 3766 8 mt in 1960s and 1980s the total average contribution from melt and rainfall to total glacier runoff for each class during different decades as well as the percentage contribution of runoff to the total hunza glacier runoff is given in table s6 the meltwater contribution to total glacier runoff is decreasing while rainfall runoff contribution is increasing combined total glacier runoff was highest in 2000s and lowest in 1980s the decrease in total glacier runoff during the 1980s could be attributed to a favorable glacier climate that resulted in more snowfall and stable mass balance during those years 3 2 3 3 oggm hydro task evaluation calculated annual glacier runoff were evaluated using observed and published streamflow data to assess oggm simulation performance according to discharge data from the surface water hydrology project of the water and power development authority swhp wapda for the last 45 years 1966 2010 the mean annual discharge at hrb outlet danyore gauging station is 10186 11 mt yr 1 323 m3s 1 tahir et al 2011 meanwhile oggm simulated glacier runoff during the same period is 3875 1 313 7 mt yr 1 123 9 9 m3s 1 from which 2999 4 242 1 mt yr 1 95 1 7 7 m3s 1 is meltwater hence calculated melt and glacier runoff are 29 44 and 38 08 of observed streamflow respectively estimated glacier melt contribution based on water and energy balance distributed biosphere hydrological model web dhm s during years 2002 to 2004 varied in range of 31 to 36 of total streamflow for the study area shrestha et al 2015 whereas the predicted melt using oggm is 94 6 m3s 1 2984 05 mt yr 1 during the same period which is 34 33 of observed discharge in same manner shafeeque 2020 calculated annual glacier runoff contribution to hrb runoff for years 2002 2007 using spatial processes in hydrology sphy which was 38 of the total basin runoff while it was higher as 60 of total basin runoff based on j2000 model shrestha and nepal 2019 mukhopadhyay and khan 2014 results based on analytical method reveal that glacier and snow melt from the whole basin contribute 74 in contrast snow and ice melt based on modified positive degree day model mpddm components contribute 38 73 to the total hrb streamflow ali et al 2017 while spatial processes in hydrology sphy model estimates determine that snow and glacier melt contribute 90 2 80 6 9 6 lutz et al 2014 while estimated snow and glacier melt based on web dhm s contribution to total runoff is 83 50 33 comparable results of our study with the estimates of enhanced model physics and model with upgraded snow and ice inbuilt modules confirm better agreement of glacier runoff component calculated using oggm in contrast to other models estimates mpddm computed snow and ice melt runoff contribution in hrb is quite lower similar behavior of mpddm toward snow and ice melt contribution were also reported in adjacent shigar and gilgit river basin srb grb hassan et al 2021 quantify that snow and ice melt contribute 32 based on mpddm and 86 based on the glacio hydrological degree day model gdm likewise semi distributed altitude belts based temperature index model calculated a 72 contribution of snow and ice melt in srb soncini et al 2015 consonantly in grb mpddm reproduced runoff show that snow and ice melt contribution is 26 ali et al 2017 unlikeness snow and glacier melt contributions predicted by snowmelt runoff model srm model is 78 adnan et al 2017 similarly estimated contribution of snow and ice melt is 90 based on sphy model latif et al 2020 78 based on srm model latif et al 2020 68 based on analytical approach in separation of flow components mukhopadhyay and khan 2014 and 80 2 again based on sphy model lutz et al 2014 different model results illustrate that predicted melt runoff percentage differ substantially within the same basin although the inconsistencies are driven by differences in replication of basin topography distribution of melt characteristics and fundamental differences in model structure in fact significant higher melt contribution in above basins may be ascribed by larger glacier coverage and snow reserves present in basins whereas mpddm underestimate melt contribution for all three basins which is due to semi distributed structure of the model physics which does not reflect the heterogeneity in landcover and melt characteristic although the variation in snow and ice melt rate induces topo climatic variables within the same altitude belt hassan et al 2021 the spatial distribution of model parameters and updated physical and dynamical modules can considerably enhance model computing efficiency further increased contribution of snow ice melt must be validated by glaciological or hydro chemical isotopic investigations 3 3 differentiating the response and impacts of glacier dimensions in future hunza glacier responses to future climate change and their impact on future glacio hydrology were modeled under projections of thirteen gcms and their four shared socioeconomic pathways scenarios ssp126 ssp245 ssp370 and ssp585 3 3 1 future glacier dynamics 2021 2100 the future climate impact differently on different glacier groups based on glacier terminus elevation and area significant changes are predicted for z5 and z6 glaciers which will lose 75 6 97 15 of their volume 65 0 93 8 of their area and 75 6 92 9 of their length by the end of this century the maximum ice mass loss from these groups z5 and z6 is generally attributed to smaller glacier areas and more sensitivity of these glaciers toward high summer temperatures which melt glaciers at a higher rate than those with a larger continuous mass loss was noticed for all glaciers except z1 glaciers where a minor increase in volume was detected in some years under ssp126 ensembles it is also important to mention that all the ensembles showed a similar impact on glacier dynamics area and length here during the first 20 years 2021 2040 while dispersing behavior in the last 20 years 2081 2100 glacier dynamic changes show relatively significant volume loss in future under all gcms and scenarios except a few although dynamical changes in term of percentage contrast highly in term of actual ice mass loss among groups calculated percentage changes in glacier storage in terms of volume area and length indicate that glaciers of smaller size would lose a higher percentage as compared to larger size glaciers fig 8 figs s18 s20 but in terms of magnitude of volume area length highest volume losses occurred for classes z4 z2 and z3 40 6 39 6 23 8 km3 and lowest for z6 z1 and z5 0 2 11 8 12 0 km3 classes fig s15 similarly in terms of area losses z4 z5 and z2 classes lost 558 6 291 6 160 4 km2 of area while z6 z1 and z3 lost about 10 8 92 9 148 4 km2 fig s16 meanwhile loss in length was high for z4 z5 and z3 869 3 791 9 189 1 km and low for z2 z1 and z6 93 69 and 55 km respectively fig s17 estimated projected future glacier volume area length for hrb glaciers and their changes w r t to 2019 2020 under future ensembles are provided in table s7 and figs s6 s13 furthermore projections applies that the large size glaciers though lose more area however undergo a lesser amount of percentage area loss at the same time this relationship is comparable to the one obtained from central and western himalayas garg et al 2017 shukla et al 2020 in contrast small glaciers with small glacier areas and lower thickness are more prone to climate warming and could demonstrate faster terminus retreat rate as compared to larger thicker glaciers zhen et al 2021 additionally many previous studies at the global level have reported vulnerability of small glaciers to climate change due to small accumulation areas correspondingly reflecting negative mass balance huss and farinotti 2012 huss and fischer 2016 small glaciers also showed higher area change rates in qilian mountains where small glaciers 1km2 glaciers even lost more than 90 of glacier area and number of small glaciers 0 1 km2 increased in basin as many other middle size glaciers are retreating he et al 2019 a prediction on small glaciers 1km2 in tien shan has also shown that continuous future warming will melt away all the small glaciers which will affect the stability of runoff from more to less in basin he et al 2019 overall basin results reveal that glaciers volume area and length are likely to decrease by 38 11 45 31 85 11 34 and 58 9 13 34 under the average of all ensembled scenarios gcms the minimum volume loss was computed under cams csm1 0 among all gcms while maximum loss was projected under ec earth3 however maximum changes in glacier dynamics are predicted under ssp585 while minimum for ssp126 among other scenarios similar behavior has also been projected for other high mountain glaciers in the surrounding regions shafeeque and luo 2021 khadka et al 2020 for interdecadal analysis at basin scale and for glaciers group we selected the 2040s 2041 2060 and the 2080s 2081 2100 as future periods and we compared them with the past changes in the 2000s 2001 2019 based on decadal analysis groups z1 z4 volume loss are higher than past decades except for ssp126 scenario comparatively less volume loss for z1 glaciers is happening in the future under most gcms and scenarios even an in increase in z1 glaciers volume is estimated under ssp126 ensembles of cams csm1 0 and mpi esm1 2 hr during 2040s for z5 and z6 glaciers volume area length losses in 2080s is lesser than the volume loss in 2040s because many of these small glaciers will disappear after the mid twentieth century and completely melt until 2100 comparatively higher projected mass loss in future is caused by snowfall amount which is projected to decrease due to warmer climate accumulation decreased and ablation increased however snowfall decrease is more significant for glaciers in high elevation followed by lower elevation minimum reduction in snowfall percentage is computed for z1 glaciers a total of 3 8 6 6 and 6 1 11 7 decrease is projected in hunza basin during 2040s and 2080s respectively on average basin total volume lost in 2000s was 14 1 km3 while the projected average loss ranges from 26 7 to 38 5 km3 during 2040s and 16 5 to 41 1 km3 in 2080s fig s34 overall average for future period showed that interdecadal projected volume loss km3 is also higher than the past period 2000s the maximum predicted volume loss occurs under ec earthh3 585 that is 64 65 km3 during 2040s and 54 97 km3 in 2080s for whole hunza basin however length and area showed consistent decreasing trends for each class 3 3 2 future changes in glacier runoff one of the important objectives of this study is to project future glacio hydrology of hrb contributed by glaciers and to estimate basin peak glacier runoff annual glacier meltwater and rainfall runoff were projected and analyzed under forced ensembles to explore the water storage availability in the future analysis showed different runoff and meltwater contributions under different ensembles and for glacier groups average of all gcm under different scenarios illustrate that future glacier runoff in hrb will decrease under future climate different groups peak time is expected to occur at different time however the basin peak runoff is projected to occur around 2060 year that is fairly comparable with the peaks of z4 group runoff projected yearly glacier runoff melt and rainfall runoff for each class and the whole hunza basin is depicted in fig 9 based on an average of 13 gcms future glacier runoff keep increasing for z1 z2 and z3 classes while for z4 z5 and z6 classes glaciers runoff showed decreasing trends after 2058 2013 and 2023 respectively the decrease or increase pattern of glacier runoff in different classes could relate to the number of glaciers glacier area and volume for example z1 class of glaciers contains only 12 glaciers but covers an area of 967 7 km2 avg 80 64 km2 and 23 glaciers in z2 class occupy a total area of 1097 km2 avg 48 69 km2 while for z4 class 719 glaciers cover 1016 6 km2 avg 1 413 km2 of total basin area and for z5 class 1118 glaciers covers a total area of 388 5 km2 avg 0 35 km2 besides these the glacier in z1 and z2 class store the highest volume of ice and they are the thickest glacier in the basin which can produce more and more melt for a longer period depending on climate change at the same time the small glacier z5 and z6 will melt and disappear in the next few decades as also predicted for small glaciers of other regions that these small glaciers will melt away and less runoff will be available in future period he et al 2019 cai et al 2022 such as glacier shrinkage and reached glacier tipping point showed depletion in streamflow of lidder valley kashmir himalayas correspondingly having serious implications on future water supply marazi and romshoo 2018 to estimate interdecadal changes in the past and future potential changes in hydrologic variables are compared for the periods of 2000s 2040s and 2080s the relative changes were estimated based on 2000s these periods indicate start middle and end of the 21st century to get a general overview of how snowfall volume loss gain relate to runoff relate with each other s these variables are merged into single graph for presentation figs s28 s34 group z1 glaciers showed a decrease in meltwater amount forced by ssp126 under all gcms except bcc csm2 mr 15 1 ec earth3 39 1 and ec earth3 veg 1 2 during 2040s and even more decrease under all gcms except ec earth3 veg 3 during 2080s under ssp245 the average changes are negligible during both decades for all models whereas the ssp370 and ssp585 based scenarios indicate significant increase in meltwater in the coming years the z2 glaciers rank number one in the hunza basin in terms of area mean area of 47 7km2 volume and rainfall runoff and ranked at number second in terms of meltwater availability after z1 and showed a relatively greater increase in melt percentage based on all the scenarios and gcms increasing trends from past to future are observed for z2 glaciers except for few ensembles under ssp126 and ssp245 scenarios group z3 also behaved similarly to z2 and for both groups peak melt will occur in 2080s excluding ssp126 projection which shows peak melt in the 2040s cynosure results were obtained for z4 z5 and z6 groups based on the results maximum meltwater of z4 would be available in late year of 2040s2040s while for z5 maximum melt is expected in early years of 2020s for z6 glaciers the gradual decrease in meltwater is projected the z5 glaciers contain 1118 glaciers with glacier areas ranging from 0 02 12 4 km2 to get good results from the ice thickness model this group was further divided into 1 with area greater than 0 3 km2 and 2 with area 0 3 km2 area and the model was calibrated separately for each class simulated results for each class and each ensemble are attached in the supplementary file fig s11 and s12 results of z5 0 3 m2 and z6 both revealed that smaller glaciers would melt and disappear and their future meltwater is less than in the past indicating that their tipping point has already passed in 2000s as per past results a similar finding was reported for small glacier by huss and hock 2018 the change in percentage for z6 total runoff ranged from 29 95 6 8 2040 s and 45 45 23 75 during 2080s rainfall runoff trends for all glacier groups and hrb were almost similar in which all showed increasing trends throughout the future period except for fewer ensembles scenarios projections table s7 large variations in basin runoff have been observed during the 21st century based on selected models the total hrb glacier runoff is projected to increase under all ssps except for ssp126 and ssp245 of cams csm1 0 relative to historical runoff table s7 the average total runoff of hunza basin in 2000s was 4163 mt yr 1 3193 mt yr 1 of melt and 972 8 mt yr 1 of rainfall under ensembled scenarios of all gcms average total runoff is projected to increases by 15 4 3 9 and 2 2 2 2 ssp126 18 3 8 and 14 6 2 6 ssp245 22 4 4 1 and 31 3 ssp370 and 28 8 4 7 and 40 7 3 4 ssp585 during 2040 s and 2080 s the average of all gcms under ssp126 explicates that peak runoff will occur around year 2040 under ssp245 peak year is 2052 wherease the average runoff under ssp370 and ssp585 scenarios project a continuous increase until years around 2070s the cams csm1 0 reported a minimum increase or minor decrease in total runoff melt and rainfall among all other gcms while bcc csm2 mr ec earth3 veg and ec earth3 represent a drastic increase in total runoff moreover the runoff components trends are different under different future scenarios overall analysis results reveal that melt and rainfall runoff both are project to increase percentage changes in melt ranges are 6 3 53 4 and 8 8 15 1 ssp126 2 5 47 8 and 3 8 26 8 ssp245 4 1 57 3 and 12 3 46 9 ssp370 and 8 2 66 2 and 16 7 43 9 during 2040s and 2080s respectively fig 9b similarly the rainfall runoff changes ranges are 12 7 55 4 and 17 9 40 4 ssp126 21 6 36 8 and 3 4 76 8 ssp245 11 0 57 7 and 4 3 105 4 ssp370 and 4 3 54 6 and 2 6 149 2 during 2040s and 2080s respectively fig 9c as per average of all projections hrb meltwater will be maximum around 2060 and decline during 2080s under ssp126 ssp245 while an insignificant increase is projected under ssp370 and ssp585 the decrease in future melt runoff after 2040s is attributed to the total volume or number of glaciers which will decrease in future the amount of liquid precipitation is increasing throughout the future percentage change for the whole basin relative to 2001 2019 is given in table s7 rainfall changes are more prominent for ssp370 and ssp585 the average increase is 12 6 and 47 1 for ssp370 and 17 7 and 68 5 for ssp585 this study results also justify previous results claiming that streamflow in the basin will increase ali et al 2018 atif et al 2019 singh et al 2021 4 conclusion we applied the oggm model to examine how glaciers with different dimensions respond to climate change in the hunza basin as no in situ glaciological data is available thus we calibrated the model with published glaciological and hydrological data the model satisfactorily reproduced annual mass balance glacier dynamics and runoff demonstrating the model s applicability to the study catchment moreover we used thirteen cmip6 models under four ssps to predict glacier dynamic response and its impacts on future glacier runoff results indicate glacier terminus elevation and area play a dominant role in controlling glaciological and hydrological responses for glaciers with higher terminus elevations z4 z6 the flow regime occurs exclusively from june to september only larger glaciers with low terminus elevation and high heads z1 flow year round mass loss was higher for class z3 and z4 glaciers hence temporal evaluation reveals that mass wastage is more in 2001 2019 0 16 m w e a 1 and less in 1981 2000 0 04 m w e a 1 though retreat and shrinkage rates for higher terminus elevation small glaciers were significantly higher 91 5 of volume and lower for the lower terminus elevation large glaciers 11 21 of volume results illustrate that different gcms and scenarios result in large uncertainty while predicting the annual variations however on average hunza basin glaciers would lose 128 km3 38 2 1266 km2 31 6 and 2067 9 km 58 94 of their volume area and length by the end of 21st century according to the results glacier runoff accounted for 39 80 of total basin runoff in the past to assess the glacier impact on glacio hydrology we predict the tipping point for each class findings suggest that melt runoff will increase for larger glaciers while it will decrease for smaller glaciers demonstrating that smaller glaciers are at high risk of extinction meanwhile peak melt runoff for medium class z4 glaciers will occur between 2040 and 2060 similar trends have been found for the entire hunza basin glacier runoff the model results of this work however may be accompanied by uncertainties which arise mostly due to lack of in situ data for model efficiency tests therefore a thoughtful approach should be taken to the results to ensure long term water security in this region
