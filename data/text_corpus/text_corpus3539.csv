system and a microsensor measuring unit was developed for no3 removal from synthetic groundwater experimental results show that efficient no3 reduction with a flux of 1 46 g m2 d was achieved at the optimal operating conditions of hydraulic retention time hrt 80 min influent no3 concentration 20 mg n l h2 pressure 5 psig and co2 addition 50 mg l given the complex counter diffusion of substrates in the h2 mbfr mathematical modeling is a key tool to both understand its behavior and optimize its performance a sophisticated model was successfully established calibrated and validated via comparing the measured and simulated system performance and or substrate gradients within biofilm model results indicate that i even under the optimal operating conditions denitrifying bacteria dnb in

mathematical model 1 introduction nitrate no3 contamination of groundwater primarily from anthropogenic activities such as intensive agricultural practices on site wastewater disposal and livestock manure management has become a worldwide concern liu and wang 2019 wakida and lerner 2005 in china 70 of population obtains drinking water from groundwater sources where fully 90 of shallow groundwater suffers from contamination and where no3 is among the dominant pollutants with typical concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 mg n l qiu 2011 su et al 2013 gu et al 2013 gao et al 2020 physicochemical treatment strategies e g adsorption membrane filtration electrodialysis photo electro catalysis and chemical reduction cecconet et al 2018 sevda et al 2018 are capable of separating or degrading no3 but have difficulties with large scale applications due to high energy demand and or requirements of post treatment steps as a result of inefficient transformation of no3 into innocuous n2 or chemical residue occurrence in treated water heterotrophic denitrification is effective for denitrification but is rarely used due to the need to add organic electron donors which are often expensive toxic have handling concerns and require post treatment cecconet et al 2018 the h2 based membrane biofilm reactor h2 mbfr is an emerging biological system based on autotrophic denitrification wu et al 2018 it is preferable over heterotrophic denitrification as it uses nontoxic and inexpensive h2 as electron donor and inorganic carbon as carbon source nerenberg and rittmann 2004 it provides high no3 removal fluxes low residual organics and biomass as well as minimal h2 loss in the effluent if designed and operated appropriately h2 can be fully utilized and the reduction of co occurring oxidized contaminants e g perchlorate into innocuous forms lee and rittmann 2000 ziv el and rittmann 2009 wu et al 2018 in the past decades a growing body of literature has investigated and or simulated the performance of h2 mbfr for a variety of oxidized contaminants elimination karanasios et al 2010 martin and nerenberg 2012 wu et al 2018 which has extended our knowledge on theoretical and practical implications of this technology so far however the further development and scale up application of h2 mbfr still faces challenges such as scalable process design effective biofilm management and a clear understanding of the fundamental principles of biofilm behavior chen et al 2019 martin and nerenberg 2012 one of most significant characteristics of h2 mbfr is that hydrogenotrophic denitrification induces the alkalization of the bulk liquid and increases the ph within the biofilm lee and rittmann 2003 rittmann and mccarty 2012 the optimal ph range for hydrogenotrophic denitrification has been reported to be 7 0 9 0 and a ph outside this range may result in lowered denitrification rates the production of undesirable intermediates e g no2 no and n2o or membrane fouling due to precipitation of existing hardness cations wu et al 2018 tang et al 2011 proven approaches to ph control in h2 mbfr involve the addition of phosphate buffer ontiveros valencia et al 2012 bicarbonate sahu et al 2009 hydrochloric acid ziv el and rittmann 2009 and co2 tang et al 2011 it has been conclusively shown that co2 addition is a more attractive choice for h2 based autotrophic process wu et al 2018 tang et al 2011 difficulties arise however in attempts to establish effective measures for precise supply of co2 in h2 mbfr an inadequate supply of co2 does not provide sufficient alkalinity neutralization while excessive co2 leads to acidification of bulk liquid decrease denitrification efficiencies and may have irreversible damage to the system ghafari et al 2009 more recently xia et al proposed a novel h2 mbfr in which two bundles of hollow fiber membranes hfms were placed in one flow cell for bubbleless h2 and co2 supply and the co2 dosage was deduced according to diffusion coefficient calculation of hfm xia et al 2015 2016 however such an integrated system has several practical limitations if it is applied for real groundwater treatment for instance it will increase the difficulty in the precise addition of co2 and impede the trans membrane tranfer of co2 across the hfms since the unavoidable occurrence of membrane fouling and biofilm growth on co2 hfms shall cause the uncertainty in how much co2 can tranfer into bulk liquid and the increase in the intra membrane pressure once the leakage of co2 hfms happens the rapid ph drop may greatly impair the microbial activity alternatively a separated co2 providing system can avoid above issues moreover a mathematical model that qualitatively and quantitatively assesses the biomass spatial distribution as well as the interaction mechanisms of microorganisms in biofilm during the co2 mediated hydrogenotrophic denitrification process has not yet been established herein we reported an innovative h2 mbfr which is connected to a separated co2 providing system for precise addition of co2 and equipped with a microsensor measuring unit for in situ monitoring of h2 and no3 concentrations inside the biofilm the effectiveness for no3 removal and the microbial activity were investigated and simulated systematically by means of experimental and modeling evaluation the objectives of this work include the following i to experimentally evaluate how the system performance correlates with key operating factors of the co2 source h2 mbfr ii to use in situ detected substrates gradients in biofilm to calibrate model and then to reveal the microenvironment e g chemical gradients and microbial communities structure of biofilm under the optimal operating conditions using the calibrated model iii to validate the accuracy of the model and to employ the model to predict the microenvironment evolutions of biofilm with changing key influence factors iv to figure out the optimal biofilm thickness that contributes to efficient no3 removal and allows complete utilization of h2 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up fig 1 a shows the schematic of the h2 mbfr system made by square section glass tubes consisting of a vertically installed main flow cell dimension 10 10 mm length 350 mm in which a membrane module containing 32 hfms hfm200tl mitsubishi rayon japan was put in the middle as well as a horizontally installed side flow cell dimension 6 6 mm length 280 mm where a single hfm was placed inside and five microsensor access ports were mounted at the top the main and side flow cells were connected to the h2 tank for pure pressurized h2 supply and the recirculation loop with a pump masterflex pump l s 16 tubing cole palmer usa at a recirculation flowrate of 80 ml min to maintain a completely mixed condition of bulk liquid related information regarding physical characteristics of the h2 mbfr is summarized in table s1 as depicted in fig 1b a microsensor measuring unit comprised of a micromanipulator a computer and microsensors for details see section 2 3 was linked to the side flow cell through microsensor access ports with the microsensors were imbedded into the hfm attached biofilm for in situ quantification of no3 and h2 inside the biofilm note that the flow cells were designed as square section instead of circular section because of the need for facilitating the operation of microscope to guide the orientation and movement of microsensor tip and the precise measurement of biofilm thickness using optical coherence tomography oct a separated co2 providing system was connected to the h2 mbfr for co2 supply fig 1c in which deionized water was pumped through the glass tube dimension 10 10 mm length 350 mm equipped with a bundle of 10 hfms pressurized with pure co2 and then the generated co2 riched water in the reservoir was transferred to the bottom of the h2 mbfr the influent of the h2 mbfr was a mixture of contaminants containing water and co2 riched water the precise addition of co2 can be realized by adjusting metering valve on the co2 tank or altering influent mixture composition i e adjusting the ratio between the volume of contaminants containing water and co2 riched water the total co2 dosage was ascertained by theoretical calculation of co2 demand for carbon source based on eq 1 detailed derivation process is described in section s2 and experimental measurement of extra co2 demand for ph control such an approach of bubbleless co2 supply can effectively avoid co2 wasting events compared to the co2 sparging method that is widely adopted in commercial scale mbfrs tang et al 2011 and is applicable to match seasonally and spatially fluctuating no3 loadings that frequently appears in real groundwater treatment processes there is a concern that the h2 mbfr with a separated co2 providing system may cause dilution issue of influent if it is applied for large scale real groundwater treatment however the degree of dilution can be minimized by mixing real groundwater with small volume of water containing high concentration of co2 in view of the high solubility of co2 in water 1 4 48 h 2 no 3 h 0 86 c o 2 0 17 c 5 h 7 o 2 n 0 41 n 2 4 38 h 2 o the h2 mbfr was inoculated with 5 ml of activated sludge from south bend wastewater treatment plant in indiana usa start up of the h2 mbfr began when co2 and h2 were supplied to the reactor at a pressure of 4 and 5 psig respectively meanwhile the reactor was operated at room temperature 25 1 c and fed with influent detailed composition can be found in table s2 at a flow rate of 0 63 ml min resulting in a hydraulic retention time hrt of 80 min although no3 was always recognized as the first electron acceptor in the case of the co existence of no3 and so4 2 in h2 mbfrs tang et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 xia et al 2013 so4 2 was added as a co existing pollutant in the influent due to its ubiquitous presence in real groundwater after several months of operation the reactor reached steady state for no3 removal 20 mg n l of no3 in the influent could be reduced by 75 and the formed biofilm attached on the surface of the single hfm had negligible changes with a thickness of 825 25 Âµm it should be emphasized that the 825 Âµm was the average biofilm thickness at different positions of hfms and the small deviation among biofilm thicknesses was perhaps due to the shearing force parallel to the hfms the relatively shorter hfms length and the two ends gas supply mode in all assays aqueous samples collected from the influent and effluent were filtered immediately through a 0 22 Î¼m polyether sulfone membrane filter vwr usa and then stored at 4 c until analyzed 2 2 bio reduction of no3 experiments short term and long term single factor experiments were conducted to investigate how key operating factors affect no3 removal performance of the reactor and or determine the optimum operating conditions for denitrification in short term experiments four series i e hrt 40 180 min h2 pressure 1 7 psig no3 loading 5 40 mg n l and co2 addition series 5 70 mg l were tested for each series one operating factor varied while maintaining the others fixed table 1 aqueous samples were collected from the influent and effluent after the h2 mbfr was operated for 5 7 hrts which is approachable to hrts used in existing references e g xia et al 2016 zhao et al 2013a b in long term experiments in which operating factor was changed after the maintaining of at least 40 days to allow the h2 mbfr system to reach steady state only the effect of co2 addition 10 100 mg l variation was evaluated since the resultant no3 removal fluxes at different co2 addition were quite different from those in short term experiments while extending the operation period of each of other operating factors from 5 7 hrts to several days or weeks had negligible influence on the no3 removal fluxes of the system in particular during some long term experiments to clarify the role of co2 only as carbon source in contributing to no3 removal the ph of bulk liquid with diverse co2 addition was uniformly adjusted to 7 5 by adding 0 1 m hcl or naoh solution if necessary according to the stoichiometric coefficients in eq 1 it can be inferred that the theoretical inorganic carbon source demand measured as c for 20 mg n l of no3 reduction is 14 7 mg l however according to our preliminary experimental results no3 cannot be completely removed then 13 6 mg l measured as c inorganic carbon source i e 50 mg l co2 or 95 mg l nahco3 was added in the following experiments given that hco3 is the dominant existence form of inorganic carbon source in real groundwater stumm and morgan 1996 and the phosphate buffer 434 mg l na2hpo4 128 mg l kh2po4 is widely applied for ph control in h2 mbfr chung et al 2007 xia et al 2010 therefore in order to demonstrate the superiority of co2 as the sole carbon source and ph regulator in hydrogenotrophic denitrification process batch experiments were performed at the optimal operating conditions ascertained by the results of short term single factor experiments under three scenarios in scenarios 1 and 2 the concentration of co2 and nahco3 in the influent was controlled at 50 and 95 mg l respectively while in scenario 3 95 mg l nahco3 434 mg l na2hpo4 and 128 mg l kh2po4 were added to the influent 2 3 analytical procedure the performance of h2 mbfr for contaminants elimination was evaluated by analyzing the concentrations of no3 no2 and so4 2 in influent and effluent concentrations of aquatic no3 no2 and so4 2 were detected by ion chromatography ics 2500 dionex usa coupled with a dionex as 19 column 4 250 mm 4 Î¼m using 55 mm naoh solution as eluent the ph of bulk liquid was continuously monitored with a ph meter accumet ab250 fisher scientific usa an acid base titration method was used to determine the co2 concentration in co2 riched water hach 1992 the effluent dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations were determined by the coulometric method using a uic cm150 carbon analyzer equipped with a cm5017 co2 coulometer uic inc usa byrne 2014 biofilm thickness was detected by oct ganymede ii thorlabs germany during the whole experimental period contaminant removal flux j in g m2 d was calculated by eq 2 lai et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 2 j q a s i n f s eff where q is the influent flow rate m3 d a is the membrane surface area m2 s inf and s eff are the contaminant concentrations g m3 of influent and effluent respectively for determination of no3 and h2 gradients inside biofilm two types of microsensors were used in the microsensor measuring unit fig 1b one of which is a h225 microsensor that is assembled with a microprobe tip diameter 20 30 Î¼m for h2 detection was obtained from unisense a s corp denmark while for measurement of no3 another potentiometric lix liquid ion exchange microsensor coupled with a microprobe tip diameter 20 50 Î¼m was prepared according to protocols stated elsewhere lewandowski and beyenal 2013 the potential difference produced by microsensors was monitored by either a ph mv meter unisense a s dennmark or a multimeter unisense a s dennmark an automated micromanipulator model mm33 2 unisense a s denmark equipped with a stereo zoom light microscope cole palmer usa and a light source dolan jenner mi 150 cole palmer usa was employed to control and visualize the microsensors movement no3 and h2 profiles measurements were performed at spatial intervals of 25 Âµm across the biofilm 2 4 mathematical model 2 4 1 model framework development aiming at the in depth interpretation of microbial metabolic process for contaminants and a better prediction of mechanism associated components distribution localization inside biofilm an optimized mathematical model was developed detailed information concerning the modeling framework can be found in section s1 on the basis of a classical one dimensional 1 d counter diffusional biofilm model which is proposed by rittmann s group tang et al 2012 by introduction into the calculated stoichiometric coefficients relevant calculation procedure and results can be found in section s2 and table s3 respectively and the expanded process kinetic rate equations note that the expansion of the microbial metabolic process kinetics refers to the fact that different from existing models the synchronous effects of inorganic carbon source and bulk liquid ph on microbial growth were considered in the developed model see table s4 2 4 2 model solution and calibration the model solution algorithm was implemented in the aquasim 2 1 g simulation platform reichert 1994 by inputting process kinetic rate equations see table s4 as well as stoichiometric matrix stoichiometric parameters and kinetic parameters experimental parameters physical parameters see table s3 s5 s6 s7 respectively illustration for parameters selection can be found in section s3 in particular some parameters i e mass transfer coefficient for h2 of the hfm k m half maximum rate concentrations of co2 for dnb k co 2 dnb and sulfate reducing bacteria srb k co 2 srb are unavailable in the literature and then were estimated by fitting the simulated no3 removal fluxes as well as no3 and h2 profiles to the experimental measurements at the optimal operating simulation conditions in this work detailed information concerning the calibration and sensitivity analysis of those parameters is described in section s4 2 4 3 model evaluation and validation the following scenarios were simulated using the calibrated model i we simulated steady state biofilm under the optimal operating conditions to reveal the inherent characteristics of the biofilm of co2 source h2 mbfr in terms of soluble and particulate components profiles process kinetic rates and particulate compounds distribution besides comparing the measured and simulated no3 and h2 gradients profiles in biofilm and the no3 removal fluxes of the system to preliminarily validate the accuracy of model ii effects of key operating factors on characteristics of biofilm with a certain thickness were evaluated by the model and by comparison of the measured and simulated system performance to further validate the accuracy of model iii the measured and simulated no3 removal fluxes and substrates gradients of steady state biofilms in the cases of inorganic carbon source being and not being considered as a limiting factor were compared to demonstrate the advantage of incorporating the effect of inorganic carbon source on autotrophs growth into microbial metabolic process kinetics iv no3 removal fluxes and characteristics evolutions of the steady state biofilms with different thickness were simulated and compared to elucidate the optimal biofilm thickness based on goodness of performance criterion lee and rittmann 2002 overall six scenarios scenarios e1 e6 were simulated for model evaluation see table s8 it is worth noting that to further validate the accuracy of model the experimental measurements in short term and long term single factor experiments were used to compare the model predictions in scenarios e2 e4 and scenario e5 respectively in scenarios e3 and e4 the measured no3 removal fluxes at h2 pressure of 3 7 psig and influent no3 concentrations of 10 30 mg n l were used to validate the model was mainly because of the extensive use of these concentrations pressure in preceding h2 mbfrs and or operation safety consideration in scenario e5 the measured no3 removal fluxes no3 and h2 gradients effluent dic concentrations of steady state system and evolution trend of effluent no3 concentration were used for model validation 3 results and discussion 3 1 experiment based assessment of denitrification performance four series of short term single factor experiments were carried out to evaluate the effects of key influence factors such as hrt h2 pressure influent no3 concentration and co2 addition on denitrification performance of the co2 source h2 mbfr fig 2 it can be inferred from parts a d of fig 2 that inappropriate selection of operating conditions could give rise to the accelerated so4 2 reduction 0 20 g m2 d and or no2 accumulation which are recognized as unwanted processes and should therefore be avoided whenever possible the optimal operating conditions are as follows hrt 80 min h2 pressure 5 psig influent no3 concentrations 20 mg n l and co2 addition 50 mg l more detailed analysis concerning the h2 mbfr performance variation with changing key influence factors can be found in section s5 further batch experimental results demonstrate the superiority of co2 as the sole carbon source and ph regulator over either bicarbonate the dominant form of inorganic carbon source in real groundwater or bicarbonate phosphate buffer extensively used ph regulator for h2 mbfr for more details see section s6 and fig s3 in view of the fact that the denitrification rate of the co2 source h2 mbfr as a function of above influence factors and the advantages of co2 addition have been confirmed as above and or previously suggested tang et al 2011 xia et al 2015 2016 we focus in this study on establishment of an accurate model to give insight to the nature of co2 mediated hydrogenotrophic denitrification process and to serve as an effective prediction tool to guide the design and management of the co2 source h2 mbfr for its prospective application in groundwater treatment 3 2 model calibration and evaluation at the optimal operating simulation conditions the selected parameters k m k co 2 dnb and k co 2 srb were estimated using aquasim built in iterative algorithms to minimize the sum of squares of the weighted deviations between the experimental measurements and model predictions detailed calibration information can be found in section s4 according to sensitivity analysis results for details see section s4 the measured h2 and no3 gradients within biofilm were insensitive to the changes of k co 2 dnb and k co 2 srb but sensitive to k m variation fig s2 similar results were obtained by preceding work that the experimental measurements were insensitive to the changes of half maximum rate concentrations k of microorganisms for substrates in h2 mbfr tang et al 2013 in addition to contributing to the commensurable simulated and measured denitrification fluxes 1 45 vs 1 46 g m2 d by calibration of the k m k co 2 dnb and k co 2 srb to reasonable values the simulated and in situ detected profiles of h2 and no3 under the optimal operating simulation conditions could reach a good agreement with the corresponding coefficients of determination r2 up to 0 99 and 0 98 respectively as shown in fig 3 a with a high accuracy which will be further validated later this model which was calibrated for the first time based on data relating to concentration gradients of h2 and no3 in the biofilm of h2 mbfr holds the potential to be used as a reliable tool to interpret and predict the denitrification related behaviors of the co2 source h2 mbfr as can be also seen from fig 3a the substrate gradients of the steady state biofilm with a thickness of 825 25 Âµm coincide with the typical characteristics of counter diffusional biofilms nerenberg 2016 namely the decreased quantity of electron donors h2 and acceptors no3 with increasing distance from the membrane side i e zero point of depth and bulk liquid side respectively according to the simulated and or measured profiles concentrations of no3 s no3 across the biofilm were always much higher than k no 3 dnb regardless of depths while s co2 and s h2 were observed to be lower than k co 2 dnb and k h 2 dnb at depths below 162 5 Î¼m and beyond 637 5 Î¼m respectively the results of particulate components distribution and microbial growth rates in parts b and c of fig 3 suggest that a depth of 162 5 Î¼m was the location where the dominant microorganisms were heterotrophic bacteria hb with a fraction reaching 49 9 of particulate components beyond this depth the competitive capacity of hb began to decrease sharply and the faction and growth rate of dnb started to increase exponentially in spite of the h2 limitation at depths of 637 5 825 Î¼m fig 3a dnb were still the overwhelming microorganisms with a fraction of nearly 80 fig 3b perhaps due to the relatively higher growth rates of dnb than hb and srb at depths of 637 5 712 5 Î¼m fig 3c as well as the outward migration of dnb driven by their fast growing in the midst of biofilm the spatial distribution of other components i e inert organics io extracellular polymeric substances eps and soluble microbial products smp can be explained as follows as shown in fig 3b the decrease in fraction of io with increasing depth was ascribed to the increased growth rates of hb and dnb fig 3c since the growth rate of io is constant the increase in the growth rates of other particulate components shall inevitably make io less competitive for space tang et al 2012 the accumulation of eps in depths beyond 162 5 Î¼m was incurred by i the increase in eps secretion of dnb as a result of the dramatic increased fraction of dnb fig 3b and ii the reduced eps consumption due to the fact that hb which grows based on hydrolyzed eps i e smp began to lose their competitive advantage over dnb for space because beyond 162 5 Î¼m carbon source was no longer a limiting factor for dnb growth fig 3a and as a consequence suffered the decreased percentages in particulates and growth rates fig 3b and c the increase of smp content at depths larger than 162 5 Î¼m was attributed to the increase in fraction and hydrolysis rate of eps fig 3a and c 3 3 model evaluation and validation of the effects of key influence factors further simulation was performed to evaluate the impacts of key influence factors i e hrt h2 pressure influent no3 concentration and co2 addition on system performance and biofilm microenvironment fig 4 a d compare the simulated and measured no3 removal fluxes as a function of changing key influence factors note that different from hrt h2 and no3 series for co2 series the measured no3 removal fluxes in long term single factor experiments were adopted to compare the model predictions since the h2 mbfr failed to reach steady state after the operation of short term 5 7 hrts co2 addition it can be seen from parts a d of fig 4 that in most cases there is a high level of consistency between the measured and simulated no3 removal fluxes the only exception was for the condition with 10 mg l co2 addition without ph adjustment fig 4d this is because the resultant bulk liquid ph reached 9 6 which is beyond the effective ph range below than 8 5 applicable to the normalized michaelis ph function for prediction of ph dependent denitrification rates estuardo et al 2008 fig 4e plots the effect of long term co2 addition with and without ph adjustment on the time course of the measured and simulated effluent no3 concentration it is evident that experimental measurements and model predictions coincide well with a r2 of 0 92 which is comparable to the accuracy of the model outputs of preceding models r2 0 8 0 99 developed on the same aquasim simulation platform chen and ni 2016 xu et al 2014 fig s4a e compare the measured and simulated steady state h2 and no3 gradients profiles as well as effluent dic concentrations in the case of diverse co2 addition with and without ph adjustment the good agreement between the measured and simulated results in all cases suggests the availability of the calibrated model to predict the utilization capacity of the biofilm for substrates taken together above evidences further validated the high accuracy and reliability of the model 3 3 1 model evaluation of the effect of hrt fig 5 a and b plot the simulated profiles of substrates including h2 no3 and co2 in the biofilm at hrts ranging from 20 to 180 min as the hrt increased the increasing abundance of h2 was observed along the depth of biofilm and the off gassing of h2 occurred at a hrt of 180 min fig 5a while opposite trends were found in no3 and co2 profiles that is total amounts of no3 and co2 in the biofilm decreased with increasing hrt fig 5a and b this phenomenon is unsurprising given that influent no3 and co2 concentrations are invariables increasing hrt gave rise to the decrease in no3 and co2 loadings while the h2 loading is unrelated to hrt but h2 and no3 are electron donor acceptor pairs that are always proportionally consumed by dnb therefore the decreased no3 loading with increasing hrt inevitably resulted in the increase in the accumulation of h2 in the biofilm fig 5c shows the fractions of dnb along the depth of biofilm as a function of different hrts at a lower hrt e g 20 min dnb were always the dominant microorganisms in diverse depths of biofilm which accounted for approximately 80 of particulate components once the hrt was greater than or equal to 80 min the inactive zone for denitrification where the fraction of dnb was lower than 5 of particulate components formed with its range extended from 0 162 5 Î¼m to 0 412 5 Î¼m as the hrt increased from 80 to 180 min the decreased quantities of dnb in the biofilm at higher hrts 80 180 min were likely due to the increasing degrees of carbon source deficiency that are doubtlessly detrimental to dnb growth in the interior of biofilm fig 5b this is in accordance with the simulation results of dnb growth rates at varying depths of biofilm in fig 5d that at higher hrts the growth rates of dnb those were present in the interior of biofilm approached to null on the basis of model analysis it can be concluded that increasing hrt could lead to the enlargement of inactive zone for denitrification which helps explain the experimental results in fig 2a that the no3 removal flux of the system decreased with increasing hrt 3 3 2 model evaluation of the effect of h2 pressure similar to the effects of different hrts increasing h2 pressure from 1 to 15 psig also caused more abundant accumulation of h2 and reduced concentrations of no3 and co2 in the biofilm as shown in fig 6 a and b specifically model outputs in fig 6a suggest that a h2 pressure of 15 psig caused the off gassing of h2 this result is inconsistent with our long term experimental observation as mentioned earlier that the off gassing of h2 happened at the h2 pressure of 7 psig the discrepancy between simulated and experimental results can be attributed to the fact that in simulation scenario a 15 psig of h2 supply exceeded the theoretical demand of microorganisms in the biofilm for electron donors while for actual scenario long term operation of membrane with a 7 psig of h2 spoiled the membrane structure and as a consequence the off gassing events of h2 these findings indicate that the development of membrane substratum possessing high anti pressure capacity is essential to i improve the consistency of examined and model predicted results since the solution of most existing 1 d models was implemented on aquasim platform which do not consider the impacts of intra abdominal gas pressure on membrane structure and ii take full advantage of the potential of biofilm for h2 utilization and consequently more efficient contaminants removal owing to the decreasing abundance of co2 in the interior of biofilm with increasing h2 pressure fig 6b the inactive zone for denitrification was enlarged from 0 112 5 Î¼m at h2 pressure of 1 psig to 0 337 5 Î¼m at h2 pressure of 15 psig fig 6c with this result coinciding with the decreasing tendencies of dnb growth rate with increasing h2 pressure at same depths in the interior of biofilm as revealed by fig 6d as can be also found in fig 6d low h2 pressure resulted in different degrees of dnb growth restriction in the exterior of biofilm for instance at a h2 pressure of 1 psig the dnb growth rate at the depths of 637 5 825 Î¼m were close to zero this finding helps explain the increasing no3 removal flux of the system as the h2 pressure increased fig 2b though at high h2 pressure the growth of dnb in the interior of biofilm was restricted by carbon source deficiency given the fact that the unexploited zone of the biofilm where the dnb growth rate approached null existed at the membrane side or bulk liquid side whatever h2 pressure was employed the management of biofilm thickness might be the optimal strategy for enhancing the effectiveness of biofilm for contaminants removal 3 3 3 model evaluation of the effect of influent no3 concentrations the simulated profiles of h2 no3 and co2 in the biofilm at influent no3 concentrations ranging from 10 to 30 mg n l are shown in fig 7 a and b the off gassing of h2 appeared at influent no3 concentration of 10 mg n l likely associated with the lack of electron acceptors for dnb in the interior biofilm to consume electron donors h2 this is supported by the experimental findings that the so4 2 removal occurred at influent no3 concentrations of 10 mg n l fig 2c in view of the fact that the onset of so4 2 reduction begins when no3 is almost completely reduced tang et al 2010 ziv el and rittmann 2009 in the inner layer of biofilm carbon source deficiency events occurred when influent no3 concentrations of 20 mg n l were employed fig 7b note that the simulated no3 concentrations across the biofilm were significantly increased as the influent no3 concentration was increased from 20 to 30 mg n l which can be explained by the biomass limitation of dnb in biofilm as shown in parts c and d of fig 7 despite the similar dnb fractions of the biofilms in the depths of 262 5 587 4 Î¼m at influent no3 concentrations of 20 and 30 mg n l the higher dnb growth rates were observed at influent no3 concentrations of 30 mg n l implying the increased dnb activity with increasing no3 loading in the central region of biofilm on the other hand the increase of dnb activity means the more consumption of h2 and co2 in this region and consequently the shortening of the coverage range of h2 co2 and dnb in the entire biofilm fig 7a c this might be the reason why the growth rate curve of dnb became narrower and steeper as the influent no3 concentrations was increased from 20 to 30 mg n l moreover in the combination of figs 2c and 7d one can infer that the slow growth rate of dnb induced by the absence of no3 in the interior and central region of biofilm should account for the relatively low no3 removal flux of the system at influent no3 concentration of 10 mg n l 3 3 4 model evaluation of the effect of co2 addition it can be also seen from fig 4d that a low addition of co2 e g 10 or 25 mg l led to an obviously lower no3 removal flux than the optimum co2 addition of 50 mg l regardless of whether the bulk liquid ph was adjusted or in other words the bulk liquid ph was maintained at 7 5 or without control the possible underlying mechanism is that the long term shortage of carbon source led to the decrease in quantity and activity of dnb in the biofilm due to endogenous carbon metabolism this is supported by the model outputs that in the case of a low addition of co2 h2 and no3 was not completely utilized by the biofilm and co2 was scarce in most region of biofilm fig 8 a and b and as a result of carbon source limitation dnb were not the dominant microorganisms and had no activity growth rate approached null at the majority of biofilm depths fig 8c and d furthermore as shown in fig 4d a high addition of carbon source i e co2 addition 100 mg l with ph adjustment resulted in a no3 removal flux approximate to that of 50 mg l co2 addition with without ph adjustment but obviously higher than that of same carbon addition without ph adjustment bulk liquid ph 6 1 suggesting the negative impact of excessive co2 addition on no3 removal of dnb this finding is consistent with previous references that a ph below 7 0 usually led to lowered denitrification rates due to the obstruction of microbial function ghafari et al 2010 2009 and supported by the model outputs that when co2 addition was 100 mg l no ph adjustment gave rise to the reduced substrates utilization efficiency of biofilm and the decreased growth rates of dnb in the midst of biofilm fig 8a b and d above evidences allow us to conclude that the dominant role of co2 in mediating hydrogenotrophic denitrification process was depending on co2 concentration given that carbon source and bulk liquid ph was the main limiting factor for no3 removal rate of dnb in the case of co2 addition below and beyond 50 mg l respectively co2 addition should be cautiously considered and precisely controlled because more or less co2 addition was detrimental to maintaining high denitrification performance of the h2 mbfr 3 4 model evaluation of the effect of biofilm thickness as have been pointed out by preceding references martin et al 2013 wu et al 2018 insufficient and excessive thick biofilms always lead to unsatisfactory no3 removal fluxes of h2 mbfr due to biomass and or substrate limitation in this sense exploring the optimal biofilm thickness is of great importance to full exploitation of denitrification potential of co2 source h2 mbfr in view of the possible discrepancy between the practical and desirable thickness of biofilm fig 9 a c plot the simulated concentrations of h2 no3 and co2 and dnb growth rates in the biofilm at postulated biofilm thicknesses ranging from 200 to 1000 Âµm it is evident that i no3 concentrations across the biofilms were not the decision factor for restriction of dnb growth in all biofilms with diverse thickness ii biofilms with higher thickness e g 800 and 1000 Âµm suffered from low dnb growth rates in the outer region of biofilms and a biofilm thickness of 650 Âµm contributed to relatively high dnb growth rates in most regions of biofilm on the premise that h2 utilization efficiency approached 100 while the biofilm thicknesses of 200 600 Âµm resulted in wasting h2 concentrations of 38 1 1559 8 Âµg l orders of magnitude high than the recommended liquid phase h2 concentration 9 Âµg l in h2 mbfr lee and rittmann 2002 iii the carbon deficiency events appeared and became the main limiting factor for dnb growth in the inner region of biofilms at biofilm thicknesses of 400 Âµm fig 9d compares the no3 removal fluxes at diverse biofilm thicknesses with the result showing the highest denitrification rate at a biofilm thickness of 600 Âµm despite this the 650 Âµm was regarded as the optimal biofilm thickness considering that the biofilm thickness of 650 Âµm contributed to a relatively high no3 removal flux of 1 59 g m2 d which is merely decreased by 2 4 compared to that at 600 Âµm but led to the complete utilization of h2 which can avoid electron wasting and formation of explosive atmosphere issues lee and rittmann 2002 moreover it is noticeable that compared to the experimentally determined denitrification rate 1 46 g m2 d at same conditions the no3 removal flux of the system could be further increased by 9 1 theoretically if the thickness of biofilm was decreased from 825 Âµm to 650 Âµm the characteristics of microbial structure within biofilm at different thicknesses ranging from 200 to 1000 Âµm are shown in fig 10 for thin biofilms with thickness below 475 Âµm dnb was the dominant microorganisms accounting for nearly 80 of particulate components as outlined in fig 10a c the relatively low no3 removal flux of thin biofilms shown in fig 9d can be attributed to the biomass limitation while for the thick biofilms with thickness higher than 475 Âµm e g 650 1000 Âµm dnb growth was subject to the greater diffusional resistance of substrates for instance srb and or hb overcame dnb for space in the inner region of biofilm due to the limited inward transfer of co2 fig 10d f in particular despite the highest fractions of dnb in the outer region of biofilm those dnb possessed low growth rate due to the limited outward transfer of h2 as illustrated by combined analysis of fig 9c and fig 10d f these evidences help interpret the decline in no3 removal flux of the system with increasing biofilm thickness at biofilm thickness higher than 600 Âµm 3 5 implications of this work and research opportunities this study was undertaken to evaluate the process performance and give insight into the nature of the interaction mechanisms of microorganisms in the biofilm of a novel co2 source h2 mbfr system the optimization design of the set up configuration was realized by linking the h2 mbfr to a separated co2 providing system for more precise co2 addition and to a versatile microsensor measuring unit which can provide in situ collected data that can be not only used for the mathematical model development but offering guidance to the management of the h2 mbfr if it is applied for real groundwater treatment a more sophisticated model was established for capturing the microbial behaviors in the co2 mediated hydrogenotrophic denitrification process expanded by consideration of the synchronous effects of inorganic carbon source and bulk liquid ph on the microbial metabolic process kinetics of microorganisms and calibrated by comparison of the measurements i e substrates gradients in the biofilm of the h2 mbfr of the microsensor measuring unit and the model predictions the model was validated to own a high accuracy in predicting the system performance in different simulation scenarios and have better application potential for describing denitrification process in h2 mbfr when compared with the one without considering the impacts of inorganic carbon source for details see section s7 and fig s5 in addition this work bridged the knowledge gap in evolution trends of biofilm microenvironment when co2 was utilized as inorganic carbon source and or ph regulator of a h2 mbfr it is worth mentioning that although the optimal biofilm thickness for a h2 mbfr can be deduced by the developed model it is still of great importance to undertake further experimental research for verifying whether the most efficient no3 removal can be achieved as the biofilm is controlled at the predicted optimal thickness by means of the well established physicochemical approaches for biofilm thickness management e g intermittent ultrasound treatment lee and rittmann 2002 and chemical reagents dosage splendiani et al 2006 in order to further our understanding of the impacts of key influence factors on the h2 mbfr performance more efforts should be paid to simulate the performance variation of the system with the simultaneous change of multiple influence factors using the proposed model meanwhile the generalization ability of the proposed model i e the applicability to simulate the microbial metabolic processes for other pollutants removal in diverse biofilm systems also merits further evaluation in the future study additionally effective method for in situ monitoring of co2 concentration in the biofilm is yet to be developed which is conductive to providing direct evidence for spatial distribution of carbon source that can be used to calibrate biofilm model and guide the operation of h2 mbfr 4 conclusions a novel h2 mbfr integrating a microsensor measuring unit for in situ detection of electron donors h2 and acceptors no3 concentrations gradients within biofilm and a separated co2 providing system for carbon source addition and ph control was developed and experimentally proved to possess the optimal denitrification performance and minimized undesirable processes at hrt 80 min influent no3 concentration 20 mg n l h2 pressure 5 psig and co2 addition 50 mg l following batch experiments further demonstrates the superiority of co2 as the unique carbon source and ph regulator for in depth illustration of the denitrification related mechanisms a model with expanded microbial metabolic process kinetics and high fidelity was proposed calibrated and validated by comparing the simulated and measured system performance and or substrate gradients within biofilm under different simulation scenarios and the optimization of parameters including k m k co 2 dnb and k co 2 srb simulation results reveal the biofilm microenvironment evolutions with changing key influence factors which can mechanistically explain the short term or long term single factor experimental findings that the macroscale process performance of the h2 mbfr was sensitive to hrt h2 pressure and influent no3 concentration and co2 addition the optimum biofilm thickness was predicted to be 650 Âµm which guarantees a relatively high denitrification flux while avoiding the off gassing of h2 owing to the advantages involving the precise supply of co2 and online monitoring of biofilm microenvironment the developed system with good reliability and flexibility may serve as an attractive candidate for no3 removal from groundwater and the proposed model offers a powerful tool to guide the maintaining and management of the system

manure management has become a worldwide concern liu and wang 2019 wakida and lerner 2005 in china 70 of population obtains drinking water from groundwater sources where fully 90 of shallow groundwater suffers from contamination and where no3 is among the dominant pollutants with typical concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 mg n l qiu 2011 su et al 2013 gu et al 2013 gao et al 2020 physicochemical treatment strategies e g adsorption membrane filtration electrodialysis photo electro catalysis and chemical reduction cecconet et al 2018 sevda et al 2018 are capable of separating or degrading no3 but have difficulties with large scale applications due to high energy demand and or requirements of post treatment steps as a result of inefficient transformation of no3 into innocuous n2 or chemical residue occurrence in treated water heterotrophic denitrification is effective for denitrification but is rarely used due to the need to add organic electron donors which are often expensive toxic have handling concerns and require post treatment cecconet et al 2018 the h2 based membrane biofilm reactor h2 mbfr is an emerging biological system based on autotrophic

2004 it provides high no3 removal fluxes low residual organics and biomass as well as minimal h2 loss in the effluent if designed and operated appropriately h2 can be fully utilized and the reduction of co occurring oxidized contaminants e g perchlorate into innocuous forms lee and rittmann 2000 ziv el and rittmann 2009 wu et al 2018 in the past decades a growing body of literature has investigated and or simulated the performance of h2 mbfr for a variety of oxidized contaminants elimination karanasios et al 2010 martin and nerenberg 2012 wu et al 2018 which has extended our knowledge on theoretical and practical implications of this technology so far however the further development and scale up application of h2 mbfr still faces challenges such as scalable process design effective biofilm management and a clear understanding of the fundamental principles of biofilm behavior chen et al 2019 martin and nerenberg 2012 one of most significant characteristics of h2 mbfr is that hydrogenotrophic denitrification induces the alkalization of the bulk liquid and increases the ph within the biofilm lee and rittmann 2003 rittmann and mccarty 2012 the optimal ph range for hydrogenotrophic denitrification has been reported to be 7 0 9 0 and a ph outside this range may result in lowered denitrification rates the production of undesirable intermediates e g no2 no and n2o or membrane fouling due to precipitation of existing hardness cations wu et al 2018 tang et al 2011 proven approaches to ph control in h2 mbfr involve the addition of phosphate buffer ontiveros valencia et al 2012 bicarbonate sahu et al 2009 hydrochloric acid ziv el and rittmann 2009 and co2 tang et al 2011 it has been conclusively shown that co2 addition is a more attractive choice for h2 based autotrophic process wu et al 2018 tang et al 2011 difficulties arise however in attempts to establish effective measures for precise supply of co2 in h2 mbfr an inadequate supply of co2 does not provide sufficient alkalinity neutralization while excessive co2 leads to acidification of bulk liquid decrease denitrification efficiencies and may have irreversible damage to the system ghafari et al 2009 more recently xia et al proposed a novel h2 mbfr in which two bundles of hollow fiber membranes hfms were placed in one flow cell for bubbleless h2 and co2 supply and the co2 dosage was deduced according to diffusion coefficient calculation of hfm xia et al 2015 2016 however such an integrated system has several practical limitations if it is applied for real groundwater treatment for instance it will increase the difficulty in the precise addition of co2 and impede the trans membrane tranfer of co2 across the hfms since the unavoidable occurrence of membrane fouling and biofilm growth on co2 hfms shall cause the uncertainty in how much co2 can tranfer into bulk liquid and the increase in the intra membrane pressure once the leakage of co2 hfms happens the rapid ph drop may greatly impair the microbial activity alternatively a separated co2 providing system can avoid above issues moreover a mathematical model that qualitatively and quantitatively assesses the biomass spatial distribution as well as the interaction mechanisms of microorganisms in biofilm during the co2 mediated hydrogenotrophic denitrification process has not yet been established herein we reported an innovative h2 mbfr which is connected to a separated co2 providing system for precise addition of co2 and equipped with a microsensor measuring unit for in situ monitoring of h2 and no3 concentrations inside the biofilm the effectiveness for no3 removal and the microbial activity were investigated and simulated systematically by means of experimental and modeling evaluation the objectives of this work include the following i to experimentally evaluate how the system performance correlates with key operating factors of the co2 source h2 mbfr ii to use in situ detected substrates gradients in biofilm to calibrate model and then to reveal the microenvironment e g chemical gradients and microbial communities structure of biofilm under the optimal operating conditions using the calibrated model iii to validate the accuracy of the model and to employ the model to predict the microenvironment evolutions of biofilm with changing key influence factors iv to figure out the optimal biofilm thickness that contributes to efficient no3 removal and allows complete utilization of h2 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up fig 1 a shows the schematic of the h2 mbfr system made by square section glass tubes consisting of a vertically installed main flow cell dimension 10 10 mm length 350 mm in which a membrane module containing 32 hfms hfm200tl mitsubishi rayon japan was put in the middle as well as a horizontally installed side flow cell dimension 6 6 mm length 280 mm where a single hfm was placed inside and five microsensor access ports were mounted at the top the main and side flow cells were connected to the h2 tank for pure pressurized h2 supply and the recirculation loop with a pump masterflex pump l s 16 tubing cole palmer usa at a recirculation flowrate of 80 ml min to maintain a completely mixed condition of bulk liquid related information regarding physical characteristics of the h2 mbfr is summarized in table s1 as depicted in fig 1b a microsensor measuring unit comprised of a micromanipulator a computer and microsensors for details see section 2 3 was linked to the side flow cell through microsensor access ports with the microsensors were imbedded into the hfm attached biofilm for in situ quantification of no3 and h2 inside the biofilm note that the flow cells were designed as square section instead of circular section because of the need for facilitating the operation of microscope to guide the orientation and movement of microsensor tip and the precise measurement of biofilm thickness using optical coherence tomography oct a separated co2 providing system was connected to the h2 mbfr for co2 supply fig 1c in which deionized water was pumped through the glass tube dimension 10 10 mm length 350 mm equipped with a bundle of 10 hfms pressurized with pure co2 and then the generated co2 riched water in the reservoir was transferred to the bottom of the h2 mbfr the influent of the h2 mbfr was a mixture of contaminants containing water and co2 riched water the precise addition of co2 can be realized by adjusting metering valve on the co2 tank or altering influent mixture composition i e adjusting the ratio between the volume of contaminants containing water and co2 riched water the total co2 dosage was ascertained by theoretical calculation of co2 demand for carbon source based on eq 1 detailed derivation process is described in section s2 and experimental measurement of extra co2 demand for ph control such an approach of bubbleless co2 supply can effectively avoid co2 wasting events compared to the co2 sparging method that is widely adopted in commercial scale mbfrs tang et al 2011 and is applicable to match seasonally and spatially fluctuating no3 loadings that frequently appears in real groundwater treatment processes there is a concern that the h2 mbfr with a separated co2 providing system may cause dilution issue of influent if it is applied for large scale real groundwater treatment however the degree of dilution can be minimized by mixing real groundwater with small volume of water containing high concentration of co2 in view of the high solubility of co2 in water 1 4 48 h 2 no 3 h 0 86 c o 2 0 17 c 5 h 7 o 2 n 0 41 n 2 4 38 h 2 o the h2 mbfr was inoculated with 5 ml of activated sludge from south bend wastewater treatment plant in indiana usa start up of the h2 mbfr began when co2 and h2 were supplied to the reactor at a pressure of 4 and 5 psig respectively meanwhile the reactor was operated at room temperature 25 1 c and fed with influent detailed composition can be found in table s2 at a flow rate of 0 63 ml min resulting in a hydraulic retention time hrt of 80 min although no3 was always recognized as the first electron acceptor in the case of the co existence of no3 and so4 2 in h2 mbfrs tang et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 xia et al 2013 so4 2 was added as a co existing pollutant in the influent due to its ubiquitous presence in real groundwater after several months of operation the reactor reached steady state for no3 removal 20 mg n l of no3 in the influent could be reduced by 75 and the formed biofilm attached on the surface of the single hfm had negligible changes with a thickness of 825 25 Âµm it should be emphasized that the 825 Âµm was the average biofilm thickness at different positions of hfms and the small deviation among biofilm thicknesses was perhaps due to the shearing force parallel to the hfms the relatively shorter hfms length and the two ends gas supply mode in all assays aqueous samples collected from the influent and effluent were filtered immediately through a 0 22 Î¼m polyether sulfone membrane filter vwr usa and then stored at 4 c until analyzed 2 2 bio reduction of no3 experiments short term and long term single factor experiments were conducted to investigate how key operating factors affect no3 removal performance of the reactor and or determine the optimum operating conditions for denitrification in short term experiments four series i e hrt 40 180 min h2 pressure 1 7 psig no3 loading 5 40 mg n l and co2 addition series 5 70 mg l were tested for each series one operating factor varied while maintaining the others fixed table 1 aqueous samples were collected from the influent and effluent after the h2 mbfr was operated for 5 7 hrts which is approachable to hrts used in existing references e g xia et al 2016 zhao et al 2013a b in long term experiments in which operating factor was changed after the maintaining of at least 40 days to allow the h2 mbfr system to reach steady state only the effect of co2 addition 10 100 mg l variation was evaluated since the resultant no3 removal fluxes at different co2 addition were quite different from those in short term experiments while extending the operation period of each of other operating factors from 5 7 hrts to several days or weeks had negligible influence on the no3 removal fluxes of the system in particular during some long term experiments to clarify the role of co2 only as carbon source in contributing to no3 removal the ph of bulk liquid with diverse co2 addition was uniformly adjusted to 7 5 by adding 0 1 m hcl or naoh solution if necessary according to the stoichiometric coefficients in eq 1 it can be inferred that the theoretical inorganic carbon source demand measured as c for 20 mg n l of no3 reduction is 14 7 mg l however according to our preliminary experimental results no3 cannot be completely removed then 13 6 mg l measured as c inorganic carbon source i e 50 mg l co2 or 95 mg l nahco3 was added in the following experiments given that hco3 is the dominant existence form of inorganic carbon source in real groundwater stumm and morgan 1996 and the phosphate buffer 434 mg l na2hpo4 128 mg l kh2po4 is widely applied for ph control in h2 mbfr chung et al 2007 xia et al 2010 therefore in order to demonstrate the superiority of co2 as the sole carbon source and ph regulator in hydrogenotrophic denitrification process batch experiments were performed at the optimal operating conditions ascertained by the results of short term single factor experiments under three scenarios in scenarios 1 and 2 the concentration of co2 and nahco3 in the influent was controlled at 50 and 95 mg l respectively while in scenario 3 95 mg l nahco3 434 mg l na2hpo4 and 128 mg l kh2po4 were added to the influent 2 3 analytical procedure the performance of h2 mbfr for contaminants elimination was evaluated by analyzing the concentrations of no3 no2 and so4 2 in influent and effluent concentrations of aquatic no3 no2 and so4 2 were detected by ion chromatography ics 2500 dionex usa coupled with a dionex as 19 column 4 250 mm 4 Î¼m using 55 mm naoh solution as eluent the ph of bulk liquid was continuously monitored with a ph meter accumet ab250 fisher scientific usa an acid base titration method was used to determine the co2 concentration in co2 riched water hach 1992 the effluent dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations were determined by the coulometric method using a uic cm150 carbon analyzer equipped with a cm5017 co2 coulometer uic inc usa byrne 2014 biofilm thickness was detected by oct ganymede ii thorlabs germany during the whole experimental period contaminant removal flux j in g m2 d was calculated by eq 2 lai et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 2 j q a s i n f s eff where q is the influent flow rate m3 d a is the membrane surface area m2 s inf and s eff are the contaminant concentrations g m3 of influent and effluent respectively for determination of no3 and h2 gradients inside biofilm two types of microsensors were used in the microsensor measuring unit fig 1b one of which is a h225 microsensor that is assembled with a microprobe tip diameter 20 30 Î¼m for h2 detection was obtained from unisense a s corp denmark while for measurement of no3 another potentiometric lix liquid ion exchange microsensor coupled with a microprobe tip diameter 20 50 Î¼m was prepared according to protocols stated elsewhere lewandowski and beyenal 2013 the potential difference produced by microsensors was monitored by either a ph mv meter unisense a s dennmark or a multimeter unisense a s dennmark an automated micromanipulator model mm33 2 unisense a s denmark equipped with a stereo zoom light microscope cole palmer usa and a light source dolan jenner mi 150 cole palmer usa was employed to control and visualize the microsensors movement no3 and h2 profiles measurements were performed at spatial intervals of 25 Âµm across the biofilm 2 4 mathematical model 2 4 1 model framework development aiming at the in depth interpretation of microbial metabolic process for contaminants and a better prediction of mechanism associated components distribution localization inside biofilm an optimized mathematical model was developed detailed information concerning the modeling framework can be found in section s1 on the basis of a classical one dimensional 1 d counter diffusional biofilm model which is proposed by rittmann s group tang et al 2012 by introduction into the calculated stoichiometric coefficients relevant calculation procedure and results can be found in section s2 and table s3 respectively and the expanded process kinetic rate equations note that the expansion of the microbial metabolic process kinetics refers to the fact that different from existing models the synchronous effects of inorganic carbon source and bulk liquid ph on microbial growth were considered in the developed model see table s4 2 4 2 model solution and calibration the model solution algorithm was implemented in the aquasim 2 1 g simulation platform reichert 1994 by inputting process kinetic rate equations see table s4 as well as stoichiometric matrix stoichiometric parameters and kinetic parameters experimental parameters physical parameters see table s3 s5 s6 s7 respectively illustration for parameters selection can be found in section s3 in particular some parameters i e mass transfer coefficient for h2 of the hfm k m half maximum rate concentrations of co2 for dnb k co 2 dnb and sulfate reducing bacteria srb k co 2 srb are unavailable in the literature and then were estimated by fitting the simulated no3 removal fluxes as well as no3 and h2 profiles to the experimental measurements at the optimal operating simulation conditions in this work detailed information concerning the calibration and sensitivity analysis of those parameters is described in section s4 2 4 3 model evaluation and validation the following scenarios were simulated using the calibrated model i we simulated steady state biofilm under the optimal operating conditions to reveal the inherent characteristics of the biofilm of co2 source h2 mbfr in terms of soluble and particulate components profiles process kinetic rates and particulate compounds distribution besides comparing the measured and simulated no3 and h2 gradients profiles in biofilm and the no3 removal fluxes of the system to preliminarily validate the accuracy of model ii effects of key operating factors on characteristics of biofilm with a certain thickness were evaluated by the model and by comparison of the measured and simulated system performance to further validate the accuracy of model iii the measured and simulated no3 removal fluxes and substrates gradients of steady state biofilms in the cases of inorganic carbon source being and not being considered as a limiting factor were compared to demonstrate the advantage of incorporating the effect of inorganic carbon source on autotrophs growth into microbial metabolic process kinetics iv no3 removal fluxes and characteristics evolutions of the steady state biofilms with different thickness were simulated and compared to elucidate the optimal biofilm thickness based on goodness of performance criterion lee and rittmann 2002 overall six scenarios scenarios e1 e6 were simulated for model evaluation see table s8 it is worth noting that to further validate the accuracy of model the experimental measurements in short term and long term single factor experiments were used to compare the model predictions in scenarios e2 e4 and scenario e5 respectively in scenarios e3 and e4 the measured no3 removal fluxes at h2 pressure of 3 7 psig and influent no3 concentrations of 10 30 mg n l were used to validate the model was mainly because of the extensive use of these concentrations pressure in preceding h2 mbfrs and or operation safety consideration in scenario e5 the measured no3 removal fluxes no3 and h2 gradients effluent dic concentrations of steady state system and evolution trend of effluent no3 concentration were used for model validation 3 results and discussion 3 1 experiment based assessment of denitrification performance four series of short term single factor experiments were carried out to evaluate the effects of key influence factors such as hrt h2 pressure influent no3 concentration and co2 addition on denitrification performance of the co2 source h2 mbfr fig 2 it can be inferred from parts a d of fig 2 that inappropriate selection of operating conditions could give rise to the accelerated so4 2 reduction 0 20 g m2 d and or no2 accumulation which are recognized as unwanted processes and should therefore be avoided whenever possible the optimal operating conditions are as follows hrt 80 min h2 pressure 5 psig influent no3 concentrations 20 mg n l and co2 addition 50 mg l more detailed analysis concerning the h2 mbfr performance variation with changing key influence factors can be found in section s5 further batch experimental results demonstrate the superiority of co2 as the sole carbon source and ph regulator over either bicarbonate the dominant form of inorganic carbon source in real groundwater or bicarbonate phosphate buffer extensively used ph regulator for h2 mbfr for more details see section s6 and fig s3 in view of the fact that the denitrification rate of the co2 source h2 mbfr as a function of above influence factors and the advantages of co2 addition have been confirmed as above and or previously suggested tang et al 2011 xia et al 2015 2016 we focus in this study on establishment of an accurate model to give insight to the nature of co2 mediated hydrogenotrophic denitrification process and to serve as an effective prediction tool to guide the design and management of the co2 source h2 mbfr for its prospective application in groundwater treatment 3 2 model calibration and evaluation at the optimal operating simulation conditions the selected parameters k m k co 2 dnb and k co 2 srb were estimated using aquasim built in iterative algorithms to minimize the sum of squares of the weighted deviations between the experimental measurements and model predictions detailed calibration information can be found in section s4 according to sensitivity analysis results for details see section s4 the measured h2 and no3 gradients within biofilm were insensitive to the changes of k co 2 dnb and k co 2 srb but sensitive to k m variation fig s2 similar results were obtained by preceding work that the experimental measurements were insensitive to the changes of half maximum rate concentrations k of microorganisms for substrates in h2 mbfr tang et al 2013 in addition to contributing to the commensurable simulated and measured denitrification fluxes 1 45 vs 1 46 g m2 d by calibration of the k m k co 2 dnb and k co 2 srb to reasonable values the simulated and in situ detected profiles of h2 and no3 under the optimal operating simulation conditions could reach a good agreement with the corresponding coefficients of determination r2 up to 0 99 and 0 98 respectively as shown in fig 3 a with a high accuracy which will be further validated later this model which was calibrated for the first time based on data relating to concentration gradients of h2 and no3 in the biofilm of h2 mbfr holds the potential to be used as a reliable tool to interpret and predict the denitrification related behaviors of the co2 source h2 mbfr as can be also seen from fig 3a the substrate gradients of the steady state biofilm with a thickness of 825 25 Âµm coincide with the typical characteristics of counter diffusional biofilms nerenberg 2016 namely the decreased quantity of electron donors h2 and acceptors no3 with increasing distance from the membrane side i e zero point of depth and bulk liquid side respectively according to the simulated and or measured profiles concentrations of no3 s no3 across the biofilm were always much higher than k no 3 dnb regardless of depths while s co2 and s h2 were observed to be lower than k co 2 dnb and k h 2 dnb at depths below 162 5 Î¼m and beyond 637 5 Î¼m respectively the results of particulate components distribution and microbial growth rates in parts b and c of fig 3 suggest that a depth of 162 5 Î¼m was the location where the dominant microorganisms were heterotrophic bacteria hb with a fraction reaching 49 9 of particulate components beyond this depth the competitive capacity of hb began to decrease sharply and the faction and growth rate of dnb started to increase exponentially in spite of the h2 limitation at depths of 637 5 825 Î¼m fig 3a dnb were still the overwhelming microorganisms with a fraction of nearly 80 fig 3b perhaps due to the relatively higher growth rates of dnb than hb and srb at depths of 637 5 712 5 Î¼m fig 3c as well as the outward migration of dnb driven by their fast growing in the midst of biofilm the spatial distribution of other components i e inert organics io extracellular polymeric substances eps and soluble microbial products smp can be explained as follows as shown in fig 3b the decrease in fraction of io with increasing depth was ascribed to the increased growth rates of hb and dnb fig 3c since the growth rate of io is constant the increase in the growth rates of other particulate components shall inevitably make io less competitive for space tang et al 2012 the accumulation of eps in depths beyond 162 5 Î¼m was incurred by i the increase in eps secretion of dnb as a result of the dramatic increased fraction of dnb fig 3b and ii the reduced eps consumption due to the fact that hb which grows based on hydrolyzed eps i e smp began to lose their competitive advantage over dnb for space because beyond 162 5 Î¼m carbon source was no longer a limiting factor for dnb growth fig 3a and as a consequence suffered the decreased percentages in particulates and growth rates fig 3b and c the increase of smp content at depths larger than 162 5 Î¼m was attributed to the increase in fraction and hydrolysis rate of eps fig 3a and c 3 3 model evaluation and validation of the effects of key influence factors further simulation was performed to evaluate the impacts of key influence factors i e hrt h2 pressure influent no3 concentration and co2 addition on system performance and biofilm microenvironment fig 4 a d compare the simulated and measured no3 removal fluxes as a function of changing key influence factors note that different from hrt h2 and no3 series for co2 series the measured no3 removal fluxes in long term single factor experiments were adopted to compare the model predictions since the h2 mbfr failed to reach steady state after the operation of short term 5 7 hrts co2 addition it can be seen from parts a d of fig 4 that in most cases there is a high level of consistency between the measured and simulated no3 removal fluxes the only exception was for the condition with 10 mg l co2 addition without ph adjustment fig 4d this is because the resultant bulk liquid ph reached 9 6 which is beyond the effective ph range below than 8 5 applicable to the normalized michaelis ph function for prediction of ph dependent denitrification rates estuardo et al 2008 fig 4e plots the effect of long term co2 addition with and without ph adjustment on the time course of the measured and simulated effluent no3 concentration it is evident that experimental measurements and model predictions coincide well with a r2 of 0 92 which is comparable to the accuracy of the model outputs of preceding models r2 0 8 0 99 developed on the same aquasim simulation platform chen and ni 2016 xu et al 2014 fig s4a e compare the measured and simulated steady state h2 and no3 gradients profiles as well as effluent dic concentrations in the case of diverse co2 addition with and without ph adjustment the good agreement between the measured and simulated results in all cases suggests the availability of the calibrated model to predict the utilization capacity of the biofilm for substrates taken together above evidences further validated the high accuracy and reliability of the model 3 3 1 model evaluation of the effect of hrt fig 5 a and b plot the simulated profiles of substrates including h2 no3 and co2 in the biofilm at hrts ranging from 20 to 180 min as the hrt increased the increasing abundance of h2 was observed along the depth of biofilm and the off gassing of h2 occurred at a hrt of 180 min fig 5a while opposite trends were found in no3 and co2 profiles that is total amounts of no3 and co2 in the biofilm decreased with increasing hrt fig 5a and b this phenomenon is unsurprising given that influent no3 and co2 concentrations are invariables increasing hrt gave rise to the decrease in no3 and co2 loadings while the h2 loading is unrelated to hrt but h2 and no3 are electron donor acceptor pairs that are always proportionally consumed by dnb therefore the decreased no3 loading with increasing hrt inevitably resulted in the increase in the accumulation of h2 in the biofilm fig 5c shows the fractions of dnb along the depth of biofilm as a function of different hrts at a lower hrt e g 20 min dnb were always the dominant microorganisms in diverse depths of biofilm which accounted for approximately 80 of particulate components once the hrt was greater than or equal to 80 min the inactive zone for denitrification where the fraction of dnb was lower than 5 of particulate components formed with its range extended from 0 162 5 Î¼m to 0 412 5 Î¼m as the hrt increased from 80 to 180 min the decreased quantities of dnb in the biofilm at higher hrts 80 180 min were likely due to the increasing degrees of carbon source deficiency that are doubtlessly detrimental to dnb growth in the interior of biofilm fig 5b this is in accordance with the simulation results of dnb growth rates at varying depths of biofilm in fig 5d that at higher hrts the growth rates of dnb those were present in the interior of biofilm approached to null on the basis of model analysis it can be concluded that increasing hrt could lead to the enlargement of inactive zone for denitrification which helps explain the experimental results in fig 2a that the no3 removal flux of the system decreased with increasing hrt 3 3 2 model evaluation of the effect of h2 pressure similar to the effects of different hrts increasing h2 pressure from 1 to 15 psig also caused more abundant accumulation of h2 and reduced concentrations of no3 and co2 in the biofilm as shown in fig 6 a and b specifically model outputs in fig 6a suggest that a h2 pressure of 15 psig caused the off gassing of h2 this result is inconsistent with our long term experimental observation as mentioned earlier that the off gassing of h2 happened at the h2 pressure of 7 psig the discrepancy between simulated and experimental results can be attributed to the fact that in simulation scenario a 15 psig of h2 supply exceeded the theoretical demand of microorganisms in the biofilm for electron donors while for actual scenario long term operation of membrane with a 7 psig of h2 spoiled the membrane structure and as a consequence the off gassing events of h2 these findings indicate that the development of membrane substratum possessing high anti pressure capacity is essential to i improve the consistency of examined and model predicted results since the solution of most existing 1 d models was implemented on aquasim platform which do not consider the impacts of intra abdominal gas pressure on membrane structure and ii take full advantage of the potential of biofilm for h2 utilization and consequently more efficient contaminants removal owing to the decreasing abundance of co2 in the interior of biofilm with increasing h2 pressure fig 6b the inactive zone for denitrification was enlarged from 0 112 5 Î¼m at h2 pressure of 1 psig to 0 337 5 Î¼m at h2 pressure of 15 psig fig 6c with this result coinciding with the decreasing tendencies of dnb growth rate with increasing h2 pressure at same depths in the interior of biofilm as revealed by fig 6d as can be also found in fig 6d low h2 pressure resulted in different degrees of dnb growth restriction in the exterior of biofilm for instance at a h2 pressure of 1 psig the dnb growth rate at the depths of 637 5 825 Î¼m were close to zero this finding helps explain the increasing no3 removal flux of the system as the h2 pressure increased fig 2b though at high h2 pressure the growth of dnb in the interior of biofilm was restricted by carbon source deficiency given the fact that the unexploited zone of the biofilm where the dnb growth rate approached null existed at the membrane side or bulk liquid side whatever h2 pressure was employed the management of biofilm thickness might be the optimal strategy for enhancing the effectiveness of biofilm for contaminants removal 3 3 3 model evaluation of the effect of influent no3 concentrations the simulated profiles of h2 no3 and co2 in the biofilm at influent no3 concentrations ranging from 10 to 30 mg n l are shown in fig 7 a and b the off gassing of h2 appeared at influent no3 concentration of 10 mg n l likely associated with the lack of electron acceptors for dnb in the interior biofilm to consume electron donors h2 this is supported by the experimental findings that the so4 2 removal occurred at influent no3 concentrations of 10 mg n l fig 2c in view of the fact that the onset of so4 2 reduction begins when no3 is almost completely reduced tang et al 2010 ziv el and rittmann 2009 in the inner layer of biofilm carbon source deficiency events occurred when influent no3 concentrations of 20 mg n l were employed fig 7b note that the simulated no3 concentrations across the biofilm were significantly increased as the influent no3 concentration was increased from 20 to 30 mg n l which can be explained by the biomass limitation of dnb in biofilm as shown in parts c and d of fig 7 despite the similar dnb fractions of the biofilms in the depths of 262 5 587 4 Î¼m at influent no3 concentrations of 20 and 30 mg n l the higher dnb growth rates were observed at influent no3 concentrations of 30 mg n l implying the increased dnb activity with increasing no3 loading in the central region of biofilm on the other hand the increase of dnb activity means the more consumption of h2 and co2 in this region and consequently the shortening of the coverage range of h2 co2 and dnb in the entire biofilm fig 7a c this might be the reason why the growth rate curve of dnb became narrower and steeper as the influent no3 concentrations was increased from 20 to 30 mg n l moreover in the combination of figs 2c and 7d one can infer that the slow growth rate of dnb induced by the absence of no3 in the interior and central region of biofilm should account for the relatively low no3 removal flux of the system at influent no3 concentration of 10 mg n l 3 3 4 model evaluation of the effect of co2 addition it can be also seen from fig 4d that a low addition of co2 e g 10 or 25 mg l led to an obviously lower no3 removal flux than the optimum co2 addition of 50 mg l regardless of whether the bulk liquid ph was adjusted or in other words the bulk liquid ph was maintained at 7 5 or without control the possible underlying mechanism is that the long term shortage of carbon source led to the decrease in quantity and activity of dnb in the biofilm due to endogenous carbon metabolism this is supported by the model outputs that in the case of a low addition of co2 h2 and no3 was not completely utilized by the biofilm and co2 was scarce in most region of biofilm fig 8 a and b and as a result of carbon source limitation dnb were not the dominant microorganisms and had no activity growth rate approached null at the majority of biofilm depths fig 8c and d furthermore as shown in fig 4d a high addition of carbon source i e co2 addition 100 mg l with ph adjustment resulted in a no3 removal flux approximate to that of 50 mg l co2 addition with without ph adjustment but obviously higher than that of same carbon addition without ph adjustment bulk liquid ph 6 1 suggesting the negative impact of excessive co2 addition on no3 removal of dnb this finding is consistent with previous references that a ph below 7 0 usually led to lowered denitrification rates due to the obstruction of microbial function ghafari et al 2010 2009 and supported by the model outputs that when co2 addition was 100 mg l no ph adjustment gave rise to the reduced substrates utilization efficiency of biofilm and the decreased growth rates of dnb in the midst of biofilm fig 8a b and d above evidences allow us to conclude that the dominant role of co2 in mediating hydrogenotrophic denitrification process was depending on co2 concentration given that carbon source and bulk liquid ph was the main limiting factor for no3 removal rate of dnb in the case of co2 addition below and beyond 50 mg l respectively co2 addition should be cautiously considered and precisely controlled because more or less co2 addition was detrimental to maintaining high denitrification performance of the h2 mbfr 3 4 model evaluation of the effect of biofilm thickness as have been pointed out by preceding references martin et al 2013 wu et al 2018 insufficient and excessive thick biofilms always lead to unsatisfactory no3 removal fluxes of h2 mbfr due to biomass and or substrate limitation in this sense exploring the optimal biofilm thickness is of great importance to full exploitation of denitrification potential of co2 source h2 mbfr in view of the possible discrepancy between the practical and desirable thickness of biofilm fig 9 a c plot the simulated concentrations of h2 no3 and co2 and dnb growth rates in the biofilm at postulated biofilm thicknesses ranging from 200 to 1000 Âµm it is evident that i no3 concentrations across the biofilms were not the decision factor for restriction of dnb growth in all biofilms with diverse thickness ii biofilms with higher thickness e g 800 and 1000 Âµm suffered from low dnb growth rates in the outer region of biofilms and a biofilm thickness of 650 Âµm contributed to relatively high dnb growth rates in most regions of biofilm on the premise that h2 utilization efficiency approached 100 while the biofilm thicknesses of 200 600 Âµm resulted in wasting h2 concentrations of 38 1 1559 8 Âµg l orders of magnitude high than the recommended liquid phase h2 concentration 9 Âµg l in h2 mbfr lee and rittmann 2002 iii the carbon deficiency events appeared and became the main limiting factor for dnb growth in the inner region of biofilms at biofilm thicknesses of 400 Âµm fig 9d compares the no3 removal fluxes at diverse biofilm thicknesses with the result showing the highest denitrification rate at a biofilm thickness of 600 Âµm despite this the 650 Âµm was regarded as the optimal biofilm thickness considering that the biofilm thickness of 650 Âµm contributed to a relatively high no3 removal flux of 1 59 g m2 d which is merely decreased by 2 4 compared to that at 600 Âµm but led to the complete utilization of h2 which can avoid electron wasting and formation of explosive atmosphere issues lee and rittmann 2002 moreover it is noticeable that compared to the experimentally determined denitrification rate 1 46 g m2 d at same conditions the no3 removal flux of the system could be further increased by 9 1 theoretically if the thickness of biofilm was decreased from 825 Âµm to 650 Âµm the characteristics of microbial structure within biofilm at different thicknesses ranging from 200 to 1000 Âµm are shown in fig 10 for thin biofilms with thickness below 475 Âµm dnb was the dominant microorganisms accounting for nearly 80 of particulate components as outlined in fig 10a c the relatively low no3 removal flux of thin biofilms shown in fig 9d can be attributed to the biomass limitation while for the thick biofilms with thickness higher than 475 Âµm e g 650 1000 Âµm dnb growth was subject to the greater diffusional resistance of substrates for instance srb and or hb overcame dnb for space in the inner region of biofilm due to the limited inward transfer of co2 fig 10d f in particular despite the highest fractions of dnb in the outer region of biofilm those dnb possessed low growth rate due to the limited outward transfer of h2 as illustrated by combined analysis of fig 9c and fig 10d f these evidences help interpret the decline in no3 removal flux of the system with increasing biofilm thickness at biofilm thickness higher than 600 Âµm 3 5 implications of this work and research opportunities this study was undertaken to evaluate the process performance and give insight into the nature of the interaction mechanisms of microorganisms in the biofilm of a novel co2 source h2 mbfr system the optimization design of the set up configuration was realized by linking the h2 mbfr to a separated co2 providing system for more precise co2 addition and to a versatile microsensor measuring unit which can provide in situ collected data that can be not only used for the mathematical model development but offering guidance to the management of the h2 mbfr if it is applied for real groundwater treatment a more sophisticated model was established for capturing the microbial behaviors in the co2 mediated hydrogenotrophic denitrification process expanded by consideration of the synchronous effects of inorganic carbon source and bulk liquid ph on the microbial metabolic process kinetics of microorganisms and calibrated by comparison of the measurements i e substrates gradients in the biofilm of the h2 mbfr of the microsensor measuring unit and the model predictions the model was validated to own a high accuracy in predicting the system performance in different simulation scenarios and have better application potential for describing denitrification process in h2 mbfr when compared with the one without considering the impacts of inorganic carbon source for details see section s7 and fig s5 in addition this work bridged the knowledge gap in evolution trends of biofilm microenvironment when co2 was utilized as inorganic carbon source and or ph regulator of a h2 mbfr it is worth mentioning that although the optimal biofilm thickness for a h2 mbfr can be deduced by the developed model it is still of great importance to undertake further experimental research for verifying whether the most efficient no3 removal can be achieved as the biofilm is controlled at the predicted optimal thickness by means of the well established physicochemical approaches for biofilm thickness management e g intermittent ultrasound treatment lee and rittmann 2002 and chemical reagents dosage splendiani et al 2006 in order to further our understanding of the impacts of key influence factors on the h2 mbfr performance more efforts should be paid to simulate the performance variation of the system with the simultaneous change of multiple influence factors using the proposed model meanwhile the generalization ability of the proposed model i e the applicability to simulate the microbial metabolic processes for other pollutants removal in diverse biofilm systems also merits further evaluation in the future study additionally effective method for in situ monitoring of co2 concentration in the biofilm is yet to be developed which is conductive to providing direct evidence for spatial distribution of carbon source that can be used to calibrate biofilm model and guide the operation of h2 mbfr 4 conclusions a novel h2 mbfr integrating a microsensor measuring unit for in situ detection of electron donors h2 and acceptors no3 concentrations gradients within biofilm and a separated co2 providing system for carbon source addition and ph control was developed and experimentally proved to possess the optimal denitrification performance and minimized undesirable processes at hrt 80 min influent no3 concentration 20 mg n l h2 pressure 5 psig and co2 addition 50 mg l following batch experiments further demonstrates the superiority of co2 as the unique carbon source and ph regulator for in depth illustration of the denitrification related mechanisms a model with expanded microbial metabolic process kinetics and high fidelity was proposed calibrated and validated by comparing the simulated and measured system performance and or substrate gradients within biofilm under different simulation scenarios and the optimization of parameters including k m k co 2 dnb and k co 2 srb simulation results reveal the biofilm microenvironment evolutions with changing key influence factors which can mechanistically explain the short term or long term single factor experimental findings that the macroscale process performance of the h2 mbfr was sensitive to hrt h2 pressure and influent no3 concentration and co2 addition the optimum biofilm thickness was predicted to be 650 Âµm which guarantees a relatively high denitrification flux while avoiding the off gassing of h2 owing to the advantages involving the precise supply of co2 and online monitoring of biofilm microenvironment the developed system with good reliability and flexibility may serve as an attractive candidate for no3 removal from groundwater and the proposed model offers a powerful tool to guide the maintaining and management of the system

17696,even the best maintained water distribution network wdn might suffer pipe bursts occasionally and the utility company must reconstruct the damaged sections of the system the affected area must be segregated by closing the corresponding isolation valves as a result the required amount of drinking water might not be available this paper explores the behaviour and topology of segments especially their criticality from the viewpoint of the whole system a novel objective dimensionless segment based quantity is proposed to evaluate the vulnerability of both the segments and the whole wdn against a single incidental pipe break computed as the product of the probability of failure within the segment and the amount of unserved consumption 27 comprehensive real life wdns have been examined by means of the new metric and with the help of complex network theory exploiting the concept of the degree distribution and topology based structural properties e g network diameter clustering coefficient it was found that metrics based purely on topology suggest different network behaviour as vulnerability analysis which also includes the hydraulics the investigation of the global network vulnerabilities has revealed several critically exposed systems and the local distributions unveiled new properties of wdns in the case of a random pipe break keywords water distribution networks complex network theory vulnerability scale free networks pipe burst degree distribution 1 introduction as clean drinking water is a fundamental demand of the population the water distribution networks wdns are one of the most elementary infrastructure of every modern settlement from a small village to a large metropolis proper operation of these systems is essential from the viewpoint of the inhabitants health living standards and industrial efficiency predicting the robustness or the vulnerability of a wdn during the design phase or in the case of working networks is still a challenging task nowadays even with the help of a large geographic information system gis database and a detailed hydraulic model the consequences of a pipe burst is difficult to predict accurately however the vast computational potential which is provided by cpu or gpu clusters does not redeem efficient and system tailored algorithms e g in the case of creating shutdown plans for a metropolis for the solution of the issues mentioned above researchers nowadays are mostly applying two out of the novel mathematical tools developed in the last decades on the one hand machine learning is starting to penetrate into the analysis of the public utility networks e g zhou et al 2019 dini and tabesh 2014 romano m et al 2014 these algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data known as training data in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task on the other hand complex network theory barabÃ¡si 2016 made an appearance where large networks e g internet albert et al 1999 social networks liljeros et al 2001 protein interactions jeong et al 2001 wagner 2003 are studied with the novel toolbox of graph theory as it will be presented later in details this research belongs to the latter group the presented results were achieved by borrowing concepts from complex network theory this study analyses the overall behaviour of the water distribution network in the case of a single accidental pipe burst due to a pipe break the corresponding utility company must depressurise the affected area creating the possibility for the reconstruction works but also depriving the drinking water from potential consumers by applying a hydraulic model the smallest island can be determined which necessarily needs to be segregated via the closing of the isolation iso valves instead of the general pipe node representation e g agathokleous et al 2017 shuang et al 2014 yazdani et al 2011 the segment valve approach idea after walski 1993 is used where the segment graph is built up using the iso valves as the edges and the nodes as the segregated islands between the valves this means that from the network theory point of view the depressurisation of a segment can be modelled as the loss of one node from the segment graph the segment graph itself is investigated borrowing complex network theory tools the focus of the current studies whether a specific graph type can describe the segment graph of a wdn universally and how that affects its overall operation in the case of a single accidental pipe break also we wish to explore the possibility of estimating the effect of a single accidental pipe break using the hydraulic model from the viewpoint of the consumers during the reconstruction beyond the segregated area that is not fed there might be consumers accidentally excluded e g closing an iso valve at the beginning of a linear pipeline while there are several segments downstream these are so called outage segments see walski et al 2006 on the other hand there might be regions which are topologically connected yet the system pressure is still insufficient to serve the demand entirely we provide methods to analyse the overall behaviour of the system in the case of an accidental pipe break and locate the most vulnerable areas we are also interested in the differences in terms of vulnerability in the network or in other words how the vulnerability is distributed throughout the network furthermore since utility companies are responsible for multiple independent networks how can two different networks be compared to each other in terms of their vulnerability the calculations of this paper could support decision making in the distribution of financial sources this paper is organised as follows first the essential mathematical tools e g hydraulic model solver that includes pressure dependent demands are introduced in the following section these methods are similar to the ones found in literature or in commercially available programs however we found it important to clarify every step in details due to the reproducibility of the current work as for the analysis an in house hydraulic solver was used it is followed by presenting the results from the analysis of the topological attributes of the real life wdns segment graph in section 3 after that section 4 introduces a new quantity to objectively measure the vulnerability of a wdn with respect to a segment in the case of a random pipe burst the last section before the conclusions reveal the scale free nature of wdns to test the ideas and new concepts in this paper 27 comprehensive real life wdns of hungary were used ranging from relatively small wdns with a few tens of segments up to larger ones with several hundreds of segments finally due to the relatively wide range of fields covered in the paper notably hydraulics of wdns vulnerability of wdns and complex graph theory we have found it more convenient to cite the relevant literature always at the beginning of the corresponding section 2 mathematical tools nowadays industrial and scientific hydraulic modelling is dominated by the epanet solver rossman 2000 which is an efficient 1d hydraulic solver with numerous sophisticated features e g the capability of the active element handling e g flow control valve and determining chlorine concentration several commercially available software packages are built on this code e g watergems see wu et al 2007 or mike see ekklesia et al 2015 moreover as the source code of epanet is available extensions are also possible in order to develop more complex tools e g pressure dependent consumptions muranho et al 2014 pathirana 2012 however as the numeric solver in epanet is highly specialised it might be cumbersome to implement new models or techniques indeed in abdy sayyed et al 2015 the authors needed to combine a check valve and a flow control valve to model pressure dependent consumption the present study employs the in house code staci available at wÃ©ber et al 2020 which is similar to epanet apart from a few modelling and numeric issues described in this section the full control over the source code made it more efficient and flexible for us to experiment with new ideas and techniques computationally staci it is not as efficient as the epanet solver but due to its modularity and general framework there is no structural restriction on the modelling equations the implementation efforts of new methods can be lower nevertheless all of our hydraulic results reported in this paper were validated against epanet beyond standard hydraulic simulations this study also makes use of segmenting wdns such tools can be found in commercially available programs as well e g watergems abdel mottaleb and walski 2020 trietsch and vreeburg 2005 2 1 hydraulic simulation the main assumptions are the followings 1d flow in the pipelines incompressible fluid and steady state operation the applied modelling software was an in house hydraulic toolkit called staci wÃ©ber et al 2020 that is implemented in c language however the underlying equations are the same as those in epanet rossman 2000 on the one hand the conservation of mass is ensured by solving 1 i in q i i out q i c for every node where q stands for the volume flow rate in denotes the pipelines those are pointing inwards while out refers to the outward directed pipes and the c indicates the nodal consumption at this point the consumption is considered to be independent of the pressure on the other hand set of nonlinear equations is solved for the conservation of energy through the edges mainly pipelines but also pumps valves etc and formally it is given by 2 p s p e f q where ps denotes the pressure at the starting node of the edge while pe at the ending node and f is usually a nonlinear function of the volume flow rate depending on the exact type of the edge the most common element is a single pipeline where function f q contains the geodetic height difference and the friction losses that can be modelled either by the darcy weisbach or the hazen williams model these equations form a system of n nodes n edges number of nonlinear equations with n nodes being the number of unknown nodal pressures and n edges is the number of unknown edge flow rates which can be conveniently rearranged as 3 f x 0 where x p q t p 1 p 2 p n nodes q 1 q 2 q n edges t contains the unknown hydraulic variables this set of equations is solved using newton s technique that is a general algebraic equation solver 4 j x n x n 1 x n f x n that is a linear set of equations where j is the jacobian matrix j i j f i x j note that j is a sparse matrix meaning that there are only a few non zero elements in each row for solving sparse linear equations efficiently in c environment one can use several packages e g umfpack davis 2004 however for this study the eigen library gael and benoi 2010 was implemented this solution method differs from the epanet where a more efficient special iteration is implemented as a result of the generalised algebraic equation solver the presented approach is more universal and different extensions or models can be added in a straightforward way without the need for modifying the solver 2 2 modelling pressure dependent consumptions as it can be seen from the presented equations basic hydraulic solvers work with constant consumption values i e the amount of water leaving the wdn at the nodes are independent of the nodal pressure the accuracy of this approach is usually acceptable since a properly operating wdn should provide enough pressure to serve every demand in the network however in some cases e g damaged systems or in the case of large consumption e g hydrant operation the pressure might drop drastically and the consumption will be below the nominal demand however even if the network pressure is low a large portion of the demands is volumetric and can be adequately supplied during outages schÃ¼ck and lansey 2018 besides even during normal operational circumstances a certain part of the consumption depends on the nodal pressure e g leakages based on the literature several different approaches are available for the accurate modelling of such phenomena e g klise et al 2017 pathirana 2012 wagner et al 1988 during this study the following function is used following abdy sayyed et al 2015 5 c p d if p p des d p p min p des p min 1 m if p des p p min 0 if p p min where d denotes the nominal demand when the consumer is fully served p min and pdes represents the lower and upper boundaries for pressure in m w c respectively while m is the exponent fig 1 depicts the pressure demand relationship with different exponent values during this study the following parameters were used p min 10 m p des 25 m and m 2 5 that is also highlighted in the figure due to the general solution of the nonlinear algebraic equation system additional modifications are not necessary 2 3 building the segment graph a properly operating wdn or its zones are fully connected graphs however in some exceptional cases it might occur that some part of the system must be manually segregated with iso valves for example if pipe failure emerges as a result an area might become detached and smaller unconnected islands are formed for handling such cases one can build up the segment graph where instead of the general link node representation the smallest parts of the network that can be isolated i e segments become the graph nodes and the regarding iso valves are the links between them the importance of the analysis of the segment graph in terms of reliability was first presented in walski 1993 there are two different approaches in the literature for building the segment graph breadth first search and depth first search see barabÃ¡si 2016 li and kao 2008 for details based on these ideas several different algorithms were developed recently for wdns e g alvisi et al 2011 jun and loganathan 2007 giustolisi and savic 2010 creaco et al 2010 showed different methods for the identification of segment graph and also suggested methods for the optimal layout of the iso valves since the size of the hydraulic models is continuously increasing the efficiency of these algorithms might be a critical issue thus gao 2014 presented an efficient method and demonstrated it using a wdn containing 70k pipelines the results in this paper were obtained by a depth first search based approach which is similar to the one published in huzsvÃ¡r et al 2019 fig 2 demonstrates the steps of the algorithm using epanet s test network net1 in which five iso valves are present first the iso valves are removed see inset 2 then starting from the first node of the system the algorithm finds every connecting node inset 3 once it is unable to reach yet unvisited nodes it verifies that every node of the current segment has been discovered and the next node is selected that is not part of the already visited segments inset 4 this mapping repeats until every component of the network has been assigned to a segment inset 5 the last step is the identification of the iso valve placements the algorithm connects two segments with a link if the segments are having a mutual iso valve e g in fig 2 valve a connects segments s1 and s2 3 topological properties complex network theory is a new research area born around the end of the last millennium allowing scientists to analyse large graphs containing thousands or even tens of thousands of edges or nodes e g internet actor network or protein interactions see barabÃ¡si 2016 a significant discovery in this field was that most of the real life networks cannot be approximated accurately by the traditional random network models proposed by erdÅs and rÃ©nyi 1959 but realistic networks are often scale free barabÃ¡si and albert 1999 meaning that most of the nodes are negligible they can be removed without significantly affecting the behaviour of the network but there also exist hubs where edges tend to accumulate rendering them critical in terms of the connectivity of the graph albert et al 2001 analysed how these networks both random and scale free behave against errors and attacks they have found that the latter one scale free is significantly more vulnerable since the loss of hubs could easily provoke the topological detachment of the network into several subgraphs such features are also important from the practical point of view the loss of some critically important parts of the electrical network caused the new york city blackout in 1977 during the investigation of the behaviour of real networks e g albert et al 1999 estrada 2006 numerous methods and algorithms were developed which are used in the area of utility systems as well based on the topology structural properties are evaluated for real life or artificial wdns e g ky networks jolly et al 2014 to understand their overall operation yazdani and jeffrey 2011 to design extensions yazdani et al 2011 to quantify the robustness yazdani and jeffrey 2012 or to identify the critical components diao et al 2014 some papers are attempting to discover a quantitative relationship between a purely topological parameter and the hydraulics see pandit and crittenden 2016 meng et al 2018 torres et al 2016 these techniques are valuable for the designers of wdns since some aspects of the network can be approximated as early as during the planning phase without a detailed hydraulic model as building such models require an enormous amount of data e g gis data and engineering work most of the works in the literature are using the general pipe node representation as a graph for the wdn even in the case of analysing the robustness resilience or vulnerability however this study follows the idea from walski 1993 and analyses the segment valve approach since the focus of the paper is to investigate the general effect of a single accidental pipe break that is a loss of a node in the segment graph the main goal is to explore the general behaviour of the real life wdns in terms of their segment graph 3 1 degree distribution of the segment graph of real life wdns in the field of graph theory the degree of a node is the number of edges connecting trough that node node degree can also be defined for directed graphs however in this study we are considering only undirected networks as water can flow in both directions of a pipe the degree distribution pk provides the probability that a randomly selected node in the network has degree k since pk is a probability it must be a normalized quantity i e p k 1 traditionally real networks were assumed to be random graphs which degree distribution follow poisson distribution however in recent years it was revealed that the degree distribution of certain real life networks is following power law see barabÃ¡si 2016 and this behaviour is called scale free the main difference is that the latter ones scale free have a relatively high probability for containing nodes with a high degree called hubs that are critical in terms of the connectivity of such networks the degree distribution of a random graph is typically modelled using the poisson distribution at the same time a scale free network follows a power law distribution i e it is linear in the case of a log log scale see fig 3 for the purposes of this study we collected 27 comprehensive real life wdns from western hungary the main properties can be observed in table 1 as it can be seen they cover a wide range from the smallest one with only twelve segments to the largest one that provides hundreds of cubic meter per hour of drinking water the average number of the isolation valves in one kilometre is 5 45 while the median is 5 which seems low compared to 12 that was found by walski 2011 for 13 real life wdns this implies that the isolation valves are much sparser located throughout the networks in the case of the segment graph of a wdn the degree of a segment indicates how many iso valves are required to segregate that specific part of the network by applying the algorithm presented in the previous section the segment graphs were built for the wdns then the degree distributions of segment graphs were analysed in the case of an isolation it might happen that further segments of the network are segregated unintentionally e g closing a dead end line at the beginning while there are more segments downstream i e outage segments walski 1993 it can happen that not every isolation valve must be closed for proper segregation due to the connection of an outage segment however during this study it is still considered that all of the iso valves have to be closed for a proper segregation since it might also happen as a result of the geodetic differences that water is flowing backwards from an originally downstream segment fig 4 shows the results of the degree distributions of the segment graph of the 27 real life wdns as it can be seen the characteristics of these distributions are more similar to the poisson distribution the mean degree is 2 25 0 19 which means that on average to isolate a segment 2 25 number of iso valves must be closed the explanation behind this surprisingly low number compared to 2 55 found in walski et al 2006 lies behind two facts first a large amount of the segments are dead ends see fig 4 which only need one valve for shutdown and second the n rule liu et al 2017 is applied at most of the junctions this also seems contradictory to the low density of isolation valves per kilometre but the explanation is simply that our networks contain long straight pipelines and also in branches the n rule is followed analysing the segments with high degrees as it can be seen in the figure the maximum degree is seven and the numbers of segments with at least 4 degrees is less than 10 based on these results it can be summarised that these networks do not contain hubs which would be critically important in terms of the topological connectivity furthermore it seems that based on the degree distribution in terms of the topology the segment graph of real life wdns are behaving as robust random graphs rather than vulnerable scale free networks because random graphs does not contain nodes with high degree i e the segments in wdns can be isolated using only several valves 3 2 diameter and clustering coefficient the last decades brought numerous topological indicators for quantifying different behaviours of networks again we refer to barabÃ¡si 2016 which are already exploited in the field of wdns e g yazdani et al 2011 in this paper we are focusing on two of them namely the diameter and the clustering coefficient for the efficient calculation of these quantities the igraph toolbox csardi and nepusz 2012 was employed a path between two distinct nodes in a graph is the sequence of edges since typically for two nodes there are numerous different paths the shortest path is considered where the number of edges along the path is the smallest in the case of a network between every pair of nodes the shortest paths can be determined and the length of the longest shortest path is called the diameter of the graph this means that from any node of the network every other node can be reached while the number of edges along the path included is below or in some specific case equal to the diameter if the diameter of the network is small for a large network then the system might have a critical part in terms of the connectivity see yazdani and jeffrey 2011 a hub which connects a large part of the nodes since this indicator is able to predict the possible hubs in the network where connections tend to accumulate this quantity represents a strong relation with the network robustness and vulnerability for some special graph the diameter can be estimated e g in the case of a 2d grid like random network it is 2 n where n is the number of nodes barabÃ¡si 2016 however for a scale free system it can be approximated using log n log log n according to bollobÃ¡s and riordan 2004a the left side of fig 5 depicts these correlations and also the data points of real life wdns as it shows even the prediction of the random graph is slightly underestimates the diameter of real life wdns the second commonly analysed parameter is the clustering coefficient of a graph which characterises the average density of the graph i e closeness to the complete graph where every distinct pair of nodes is directly connected with a unique edge this quantity can be defined as the average number of the connections between the neighbours of an arbitrarily selected node in the network see meng et al 2018 therefore the clustering coefficient tend to be high in the case of a highly looped network while zero for a tree like system for a scale free network the clustering coefficient is expected to be high due to the hubs while for random networks it is expected to be close to zero this quantity can also be approximated for special cases for a random network we have k n where k is the average degree that is 2 25 for our wdns and for a scale free network log n 2 n see bollobÃ¡s and riordan 2004b the right side of fig 5 presents the results for the approximations with the results from the real life wdns the scale free estimation is clearly incorrect while the prediction from the random graph is significantly closer it also important to highlight that the clustering coefficient of 14 networks out of 27 equals to zero based on the results of diameter and clustering coefficient strictly from the topological point of view the segment graph of real life wdns behave similarly to random graphs rather than scale free networks this indicates that based on using only the previously described traditional complex network theory concepts the real life wdns are robust against random pipe failures however there are also differences on the one hand a segment graph of a wdn is necessarily connected i e there cannot be nodes segments separately from the main body of the system on the other hand it is essential that a wdn is a planar network i e edges cannot cross each other without a node which is not valid for random graphs in general in overall based on the degree distributions and the structural properties the segment graph of a wdn behaves like a connected planar random graph the corresponding literature on complex graph theory generally affirms that scale free networks are much more sensitive than random networks to attacks indicating that random networks are more robust see e g guillaume et al 2005 our result that is the wdn analysed here are similar to random graphs is counterintuitive in the sense that wdns are known to be vulnerable in the hydraulic sense even though there is an intentionally engineered redundancy in them for example isolation of central segments in the downtown change the system hydraulics completely or multiple pressure zones connected in series at the outer verges of the network might also be weak points 3 3 universal degree distribution function for real life wdns the purpose of the current subsection is to create a universal function which is able to approximate the degree distribution of the segment graph of a general real life wdn based on the degree distribution and the structural properties it seems that the segment graphs of wdns behave as random graphs thus one might fit the poisson distribution for describing the degree distribution in general however the fact that the topology of a wdn is planar by nature and every node is necessarily connected thus there are no nodes with zero edges i e there are no segments without iso valves these properties make this approach unsuitable for example if one would like to describe a wdn using a poisson distribution with average degree of 2 25 more than 10 of the nodes would have zero degrees due to these difficulties another idea came up to create a general function for the approximation of the degree distributions the function was defined by taking the average of the relative frequencies at each degree for numerical values see table 2 that is still a distribution function i e the sum is equal to one this fitted function also the poisson distribution can be observed in fig 6 with the real life wdns a statistical hypothesis test namely chi squared test see montgomery and runger 2003 was performed for the investigation of the results homogeneity i e it was analysed whether the degree distributions of the real life wdns follow the same distribution as the fitted function or as the poisson in the case of 95 of significance level 85 precisely 23 out of 27 of the wdns follows the fitted function while that is only 51 14 out of 27 for the latter one based on these calculations the degree distributions of real life wdns segment graph follow a unique distribution and most of the analysed wdns within these ranges of system properties see table 1 can be described by this fitted function the practical benefit of this degree function is twofold on the one hand this could be a basis for comparison for different wdns especially coming from outside of hungary or even outside of europe it would be interesting to see if other wdns share the same property on the other hand this could be a guideline for wdn planner for judging the location of isolation valves if the distribution for a wdn is dominated by low degree that is most of the segments can be isolated by one or two iso valves the system is more robust but if there are numerous segments with high degree operating problems might arise due to the need of shutting several iso valves see also huzsvÃ¡r et al 2019 4 vulnerability of wdns in the previous decades numerous publications focused on the quantification of the resilience todini 2000 reliability zhuang et al 2013 or vulnerability shuang et al 2014 of different type of networks the main goal in the literature is to properly define a parameter that describes these aspects of wastewater sweetapple et al 2018 networks urban drainage systems wang et al 2019 water resources infrastructure porse and lund 2016 or as in our case wdns diao et al 2016 the idea is to define a quantity which is able to characterise the behaviour of networks from a selected aspect hence it could support decision making in the case of new network design or during network condition analysis even if these networks are serving different purposes analogous ideas are applied in the literature e g the resilience analysis was used in mugume et al 2015 for the investigation of urban flooding and in diao et al 2016 for wdns a review article was presented in hosseini et al 2016 about the resilience analysis of several different types of networks these publications strengthen the attitude that applying ideas from neighbouring research areas might lead to novel results while numerous studies were dealing with the question of resilience reliability or risk analysis of the different type of utility networks this paper analyses the vulnerability of the segment graphs of wdns the goal of our study is to discover the average behaviour of wdns in a single accidental pipe break therefore in this approach it is considered that the probability of a possible pipe burst is equal throughout the system i e every meter of pipelines has the same chance to break this methodology can be extended by weighting the probability using data of the wdns e g if there is a network specific connection between the frequency of pipe bursts and the material of the pipeline a case study can be performed with increased accuracy during this study we assumed that every isolation valve is properly operating thus for the isolation of a single pipe break only one segment must be depressurised important to mention that for the analysis of a specific real life network this hypothesis might not be thorough and the topic of improperly working isolation valves can also be a research area abdel mottaleb and walski 2020 liu et al 2017 although some papers gheisi and naser 2014 jacobs and goulter 1991 sweetapple et al 2019 are suggesting that pipe or node failures tend to accumulate this study focuses on a single segment loss that is originating from a single pipe break finally the nominal demands of the real life wdns are calculated based on the billing system and yearly averages are defined again the purpose of the study is to discover the overall behaviour of a wdn in an accidental pipe break the method can be extended in this aspect as well by taking into consideration e g adjusting the demands using specific pattern daily weekly or monthly thus performing a detailed analysis on certain cases 4 1 definition of vulnerability maiolo et al 2018 reviewed a few different definitions of vulnerability from the literature and most of them are based on topological approaches the goal of the vulnerability according to the definition in this paper is to catch the general hydraulic behaviour of wdns in a single pipe break thus it is based on the hydraulic model important that most of the vulnerability definitions from the literature belongs either to pipelines or nodes while this paper is focusing on segments similarly to abdel mottaleb and walski 2020 as a results every element from a segment is having the same vulnerability since every failure is causing the loss of the whole segment the quantity is also dimensionless thus it can be applied for comparing wdns with different sizes first the length of every pipeline in the ith segment is denoted by li typically there are several pipelines in one segment also it is normalized using the overall pipe length throughout the network li thus Î» i l i l i this Î»i quantity denotes the relative pipeline length and it also indicates the failure rate of the ith segment second the amount of drinking water that cannot be provided in the case of the segregation of the ith segment is calculated by the 1d hydraulic solver i e b i d i c i where di indicates the nominal demand and ci represents the actual amount of served water according to the model for calculating this one must be able to cope with a demands cannot be served inside the isolated segment b there might be some parts of the network that are segregated unintentionally i e outage segments furthermore c even in the case if a segment is topologically connecting to the main network the hydraulic conditions might change on a scale and the pressure of a segment drops drastically that it is not capable of providing enough water to fulfil the nominal demand i e the hydraulic solver must be able to handle pressure dependent consumptions the bi variable is also normalized using the overall nominal demand i e Î² i b i d i this shows the relative loss in the overall nominal demand which is caused by the isolation of the ith segment this quantity is similar to the demand shortfall in watergems see liu et al 2017 but analogous parameters can be determined with other commercially available software as well e g mike urban pipe criticality using the previously defined quantities the local vulnerability Î³i of the network with respect to the ith segment is 6 Î³ i Î» i Î² i this parameter is dimensionless and segment specific moreover it is a product of the failure rate Î»i and the relative loss Î²i caused by the ith segment failure according to this definition the vulnerability is high if a segment both contains a significant amount of pipelines and causes a considerable amount of loss in the provided drinking water in the case of its isolation if there is a segment e g close to the major input point where most of the drinking water is supplied i e Î²i is high but there are only a few meters of pipes Î»i is small the vulnerability might be lower compared to a segment with hundreds meters of pipelines Î»i is high and with an average loss in consumption Î²i is moderate also in the opposite case if there are long pipelines in a segment but the loss caused to the consumptions is negligible e g this part is a dead end of the network the vulnerability might be still small to perform a thorough analysis for the behaviour of wdns every possible scenario was simulated i e the affect of isolation of every segment was individually calculated applying this definition for the vulnerability is already a valuable tool in order to unveil the critical areas of a wdn and the network can be colourised according to local vulnerabilities fig 7 shows an example of this where several critically vulnerable segments are revealed for the improvement of the wdn one might consider increasing the number of iso valves in these areas to reduce the local vulnerabilities 4 2 scale free nature of wdns during the examination of the spatial maps of local vulnerabilities it was revealed that in each wdn there are only a few critical segments while the rest of the networks is far less exposed therefore a detailed analysis was performed on the distributions of local vulnerabilities by drawing the probability density function pdf montgomery and runger 2003 or also called frequency distribution this representation is similar to the histogram but there are also some differences as we are plotting sampled data instead of a continuous variable the main advantage of this graphical illustration compared to the traditional statistical metrics e g average standard deviation or box plot that it depicts the small details by indicating the dispersion between the minimum and maximum values of the data structure moreover it is capable of visualising the number and the location of stagnation points where the data points tend to accumulate and it also unveils the elementary tendencies of the data and highlights the connections of the values the steps of creating such a graph are the following first the whole range between the minimum and the maximum values were split into r number of bins where r n s e g if nseg 100 and r log 2 n s e g 1 otherwise where nseg is the number of segments this means that each network is represented using r number of points in the diagram that is between four and ten for these wdns second the boundaries of the bins were defined by sorting the same amount of data into each bin i e the frequencies were equally distributed third while determining the y coordinate of each point it is considered that the product of the horizontal width of the interval and the height of the point is equal to the relative frequency i e these points share the same size of areas which ensures that the cumulative distribution function which is the integral of the pdf tends to 1 as x tends to infinity fig 8 depicts the sampled probability density function of local vulnerabilities Î³i see eq 6 for 27 real life wdns using log log scale note that almost every wdn contains some segments with zero vulnerabilities which means that the isolation of these parts will not affect the consumption at all because there is no demand within the segment and the looped network can fulfil the water need of downstream segments these are not interpreted during the analysis of the distribution of local vulnerabilities because it is not possible to visualise the zero values on a log log scale we define highly vulnerable segments as those ones whose local vulnerability exceeds 10 2 meaning that e g probability failure is 10 and the segment 10 of the demands is lost if the segment needs to be isolated another segment with 50 of failure probability and 2 of demand loss would also be deemed as vulnerable by definition a segment is moderately vulnerable if its local vulnerability is above than 10 3 that is in average it includes 3 15 of pipes and supplies 3 15 of the overall consumption obviously these thresholds are artificial and might be argued the points are located along a linear line that implies power law probability distribution which indicates similar behaviour to the scale free networks due to the nature of a scale free network it contains critical nodes with high degree hub which might be significantly higher than the average and the loss of a hub could lead to the detachment of the network as fig 8 depicts the local vulnerabilities wdns also include segments with high vulnerability see highly vulnerable region that implies that during the loss of such a segment serious outage in water service might occur besides the highly vulnerable segments some parts of the networks can be found in the moderately vulnerable region and most segments can be considered negligible in terms of vulnerability the linear trend that is power law probability distribution also highlights that a large part of the network is slightly or not at all vulnerable some regions are moderately vulnerable but most importantly there will be a few segments that are highly vulnerable distribution of household incomes there are very few billionaires but the bulk of the population holds modest financial resources or magnitude of earthquakes follow similar distribution for example in the case of network 8 the probability of a randomly picked segment having larger vulnerability than 10 2 i e it is highly vulnerable is more than 5 meaning that more than 5 of the segments are highly exposed in overall this method is able to emphasise the magnitude differences in the vulnerability of segments i e it can highlight the most exposed parts of the network due to the highly inhomogeneous distribution of local vulnerabilities 4 3 analysing the network vulnerabilities besides the importance of the local distribution of vulnerabilities inside a network it is also useful to evaluate the overall quality of a network from the viewpoint of vulnerability for comparison with other wdns thereby the decision making of the utility company can be supported in the optimal allocation of reconstruction and development resources therefore the network vulnerability is introduced which is the sum of local vulnerabilities that is 7 Î³ i Î² i l i i l i i Î² i Î» i i Î³ i this is the weighted average of the local consumption outages i e Î³ is the expected value of the amount of water loss in the case of a single accidental pipe break according to the hydraulic model fig 9 provides the result obtained by the vulnerability analysis of the 27 wdn via box plot as it can be seen most network vulnerability values are under 0 2 however there are three networks where the Î³ value exceeds 0 4 outliers this means that these networks are highly vulnerable compared to the rest of the sample and during a random segment loss all over the system the expected value of unserved demand is above 40 obviously this is a statistical analysis and does not mean that if a pipe breaks anywhere in the system 40 will be lost but gives an aggregated expected value of the severeness of a random pipe failure these outlier networks need a scrutiny to unveil the origin of this high possible outage in the service of demands 5 conclusions this paper presented the analysis of the vulnerability of wdns with respect to a single random pipe burst an algorithm was introduced that is capable of creating the segment graph of a wdn efficiently where the edges are the isolation iso valves and the segments containing several pipes are the nodes a segment wise measure of local vulnerability was defined as the product of the relative pipeline length that is proportional to the probability of pipe burst and the relative amount of unfulfilled demand in the case of the shutdown of the segment thus those segments are considered as vulnerable that have a high probability of failure and the amount of lost demand is high the concept of network vulnerability was also introduced that quantifies the expected value of relative consumption that cannot be served due to a single accidental pipe break to test these novel concepts 27 real life wdns of hungary were used with a wide range of pipeline lengths overall demands and topology based on the results the following conclusions can be drawn the analysis of the degree distributions of the segment graphs unveiled that the number of hubs nodes with high degree is negligible most parts of the wdns can be segregated by closing not more than 3 iso valves and the average is 2 25 based on this and the fact that the diameters in the sense of graph theory of these networks are large and the clustering coefficients are almost zero the behaviour of the segment graph of real life wdns is close to a random graph if only the topology is considered in other words strictly from the topological point of view the segment graph of a wdn is a planar connected random graph naively this would suggest that such networks are robust against random pipe burst an approximating degree distribution for the segment graph of real life wdns was provided and a statistical hypothesis test chi square test was performed in order to investigate whether the real distributions could be originated from the fitted one based on the test 85 of the wdns were accepted 23 out of 27 which means most of the degree distributions of the segment graph of wdns can described with this general function at least for the sample used in this study from the practical point of view this distribution can be utilised for comparing other networks especially during the design phase of new wdns and it can support decision making in terms of the number or location of isolation valves beyond purely topological analysis the proposed new measure for vulnerability exploits also the hydraulic properties of the network via pressure dependent demands our vulnerability indicator is objective free of user defined parameters dimensionless allows the comparison of different networks segment based and can be extended straightforward way towards non uniform failure distribution over the network by the detailed investigation of the probability density functions of these local vulnerabilities it was revealed that the behaviour of wdns is similar to the scale free networks in terms of its vulnerability that is most segments are slightly vulnerable while some parts segments are critical in terms of lost demand similar to hubs in a scale free network a pipe burst in one of these highly vulnerable segments of a wdn might lead to a serious outage in water service because either they contain a significant amount of demands or they transfer a large quantity of water the proposed network vulnerability parameter revealed that 3 wdns out of 27 have serious issues in terms of vulnerability because in the case of a random pipe break more than 40 of the demands cannot be served according to their hydraulic model as this parameter characterises the overall quality of the network it can support the decision making process in the distribution of reconstruction resources or upgrade capacities besides these conclusions there are some open questions and directions for further analysis and research in terms of the degree distributions it would be useful to test more real life wdns against our proposed function and explore whether they follow the same distribution this would be especially interesting in the case of wdns outside of hungary or europe as the results showed traditional graph tools such as degree distribution diameter clustering coefficient cannot reveal the scale free nature of wdn thus it would be useful from the practical point of view to find a purely topological parameter that does not require detailed hydraulic model that is capable of unveiling this aspect if such measure exists because setting up the hydraulic simulation requires significant effort in terms of the design of a new wdn one might consider building a new algorithm that is able to create a more favourable distribution of local vulnerabilities to avoid the highly exposed areas this might also be interesting for already existing systems by recreating the layout of the isolation valves it would also be straightforward to use the system vulnerability parameter as the objective function of an optimisation

17696,even the best maintained water distribution network wdn might suffer pipe bursts occasionally and the utility company must reconstruct the damaged sections of the system the affected area must be segregated by closing the corresponding isolation valves as a result the required amount of drinking water might not be available this paper explores the behaviour and topology of segments especially their criticality from the viewpoint of the whole system a novel objective dimensionless segment based quantity is proposed to evaluate the vulnerability of both the segments and the whole wdn against a single incidental pipe break computed as the product of the probability of failure within the segment and the amount of unserved consumption 27 comprehensive real life wdns have been examined by means of the new metric and with the help of complex network theory exploiting the concept of the degree distribution and topology based structural properties e g network diameter clustering coefficient it was found that metrics based purely on topology suggest different network behaviour as vulnerability analysis which also includes the hydraulics the investigation of the global network vulnerabilities has revealed several critically exposed systems and the local distributions unveiled new properties of wdns in the case of a random pipe break keywords water distribution networks complex network theory vulnerability scale free networks pipe burst degree distribution 1 introduction as clean drinking water is a fundamental demand of the population the water distribution networks wdns are one of the most elementary infrastructure of every modern settlement from a small village to a large metropolis proper operation of these systems is essential from the viewpoint of the inhabitants health living standards and industrial efficiency predicting the robustness or the vulnerability of a wdn during the design phase or in the case of working networks is still a challenging task nowadays even with the help of a large geographic information system gis database and a detailed hydraulic model the consequences of a pipe burst is difficult to predict accurately however the vast computational potential which is provided by cpu or gpu clusters does not redeem efficient and system tailored algorithms e g in the case of creating shutdown plans for a metropolis for the solution of the issues mentioned above researchers nowadays are mostly applying two out of the novel mathematical tools developed in the last decades on the one hand machine learning is starting to penetrate into the analysis of the public utility networks e g zhou et al 2019 dini and tabesh 2014 romano m et al 2014 these algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data known as training data in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task on the other hand complex network theory barabÃ¡si 2016 made an appearance where large networks e g internet albert et al 1999 social networks liljeros et al 2001 protein interactions jeong et al 2001 wagner 2003 are studied with the novel toolbox of graph theory as it will be presented later in details this research belongs to the latter group the presented results were achieved by borrowing concepts from complex network theory this study analyses the overall behaviour of the water distribution network in the case of a single accidental pipe burst due to a pipe break the corresponding utility company must depressurise the affected area creating the possibility for the reconstruction works but also depriving the drinking water from potential consumers by applying a hydraulic model the smallest island can be determined which necessarily needs to be segregated via the closing of the isolation iso valves instead of the general pipe node representation e g agathokleous et al 2017 shuang et al 2014 yazdani et al 2011 the segment valve approach idea after walski 1993 is used where the segment graph is built up using the iso valves as the edges and the nodes as the segregated islands between the valves this means that from the network theory point of view the depressurisation of a segment can be modelled as the loss of one node from the segment graph the segment graph itself is investigated borrowing complex network theory tools the focus of the current studies whether a specific graph type can describe the segment graph of a wdn universally and how that affects its overall operation in the case of a single accidental pipe break also we wish to explore the possibility of estimating the effect of a single accidental pipe break using the hydraulic model from the viewpoint of the consumers during the reconstruction beyond the segregated area that is not fed there might be consumers accidentally excluded e g closing an iso valve at the beginning of a linear pipeline while there are several segments downstream these are so called outage segments see walski et al 2006 on the other hand there might be regions which are topologically connected yet the system pressure is still insufficient to serve the demand entirely we provide methods to analyse the overall behaviour of the system in the case of an accidental pipe break and locate the most vulnerable areas we are also interested in the differences in terms of vulnerability in the network or in other words how the vulnerability is distributed throughout the network furthermore since utility companies are responsible for multiple independent networks how can two different networks be compared to each other in terms of their vulnerability the calculations of this paper could support decision making in the distribution of financial sources this paper is organised as follows first the essential mathematical tools e g hydraulic model solver that includes pressure dependent demands are introduced in the following section these methods are similar to the ones found in literature or in commercially available programs however we found it important to clarify every step in details due to the reproducibility of the current work as for the analysis an in house hydraulic solver was used it is followed by presenting the results from the analysis of the topological attributes of the real life wdns segment graph in section 3 after that section 4 introduces a new quantity to objectively measure the vulnerability of a wdn with respect to a segment in the case of a random pipe burst the last section before the conclusions reveal the scale free nature of wdns to test the ideas and new concepts in this paper 27 comprehensive real life wdns of hungary were used ranging from relatively small wdns with a few tens of segments up to larger ones with several hundreds of segments finally due to the relatively wide range of fields covered in the paper notably hydraulics of wdns vulnerability of wdns and complex graph theory we have found it more convenient to cite the relevant literature always at the beginning of the corresponding section 2 mathematical tools nowadays industrial and scientific hydraulic modelling is dominated by the epanet solver rossman 2000 which is an efficient 1d hydraulic solver with numerous sophisticated features e g the capability of the active element handling e g flow control valve and determining chlorine concentration several commercially available software packages are built on this code e g watergems see wu et al 2007 or mike see ekklesia et al 2015 moreover as the source code of epanet is available extensions are also possible in order to develop more complex tools e g pressure dependent consumptions muranho et al 2014 pathirana 2012 however as the numeric solver in epanet is highly specialised it might be cumbersome to implement new models or techniques indeed in abdy sayyed et al 2015 the authors needed to combine a check valve and a flow control valve to model pressure dependent consumption the present study employs the in house code staci available at wÃ©ber et al 2020 which is similar to epanet apart from a few modelling and numeric issues described in this section the full control over the source code made it more efficient and flexible for us to experiment with new ideas and techniques computationally staci it is not as efficient as the epanet solver but due to its modularity and general framework there is no structural restriction on the modelling equations the implementation efforts of new methods can be lower nevertheless all of our hydraulic results reported in this paper were validated against epanet beyond standard hydraulic simulations this study also makes use of segmenting wdns such tools can be found in commercially available programs as well e g watergems abdel mottaleb and walski 2020 trietsch and vreeburg 2005 2 1 hydraulic simulation the main assumptions are the followings 1d flow in the pipelines incompressible fluid and steady state operation the applied modelling software was an in house hydraulic toolkit called staci wÃ©ber et al 2020 that is implemented in c language however the underlying equations are the same as those in epanet rossman 2000 on the one hand the conservation of mass is ensured by solving 1 i in q i i out q i c for every node where q stands for the volume flow rate in denotes the pipelines those are pointing inwards while out refers to the outward directed pipes and the c indicates the nodal consumption at this point the consumption is considered to be independent of the pressure on the other hand set of nonlinear equations is solved for the conservation of energy through the edges mainly pipelines but also pumps valves etc and formally it is given by 2 p s p e f q where ps denotes the pressure at the starting node of the edge while pe at the ending node and f is usually a nonlinear function of the volume flow rate depending on the exact type of the edge the most common element is a single pipeline where function f q contains the geodetic height difference and the friction losses that can be modelled either by the darcy weisbach or the hazen williams model these equations form a system of n nodes n edges number of nonlinear equations with n nodes being the number of unknown nodal pressures and n edges is the number of unknown edge flow rates which can be conveniently rearranged as 3 f x 0 where x p q t p 1 p 2 p n nodes q 1 q 2 q n edges t contains the unknown hydraulic variables this set of equations is solved using newton s technique that is a general algebraic equation solver 4 j x n x n 1 x n f x n that is a linear set of equations where j is the jacobian matrix j i j f i x j note that j is a sparse matrix meaning that there are only a few non zero elements in each row for solving sparse linear equations efficiently in c environment one can use several packages e g umfpack davis 2004 however for this study the eigen library gael and benoi 2010 was implemented this solution method differs from the epanet where a more efficient special iteration is implemented as a result of the generalised algebraic equation solver the presented approach is more universal and different extensions or models can be added in a straightforward way without the need for modifying the solver 2 2 modelling pressure dependent consumptions as it can be seen from the presented equations basic hydraulic solvers work with constant consumption values i e the amount of water leaving the wdn at the nodes are independent of the nodal pressure the accuracy of this approach is usually acceptable since a properly operating wdn should provide enough pressure to serve every demand in the network however in some cases e g damaged systems or in the case of large consumption e g hydrant operation the pressure might drop drastically and the consumption will be below the nominal demand however even if the network pressure is low a large portion of the demands is volumetric and can be adequately supplied during outages schÃ¼ck and lansey 2018 besides even during normal operational circumstances a certain part of the consumption depends on the nodal pressure e g leakages based on the literature several different approaches are available for the accurate modelling of such phenomena e g klise et al 2017 pathirana 2012 wagner et al 1988 during this study the following function is used following abdy sayyed et al 2015 5 c p d if p p des d p p min p des p min 1 m if p des p p min 0 if p p min where d denotes the nominal demand when the consumer is fully served p min and pdes represents the lower and upper boundaries for pressure in m w c respectively while m is the exponent fig 1 depicts the pressure demand relationship with different exponent values during this study the following parameters were used p min 10 m p des 25 m and m 2 5 that is also highlighted in the figure due to the general solution of the nonlinear algebraic equation system additional modifications are not necessary 2 3 building the segment graph a properly operating wdn or its zones are fully connected graphs however in some exceptional cases it might occur that some part of the system must be manually segregated with iso valves for example if pipe failure emerges as a result an area might become detached and smaller unconnected islands are formed for handling such cases one can build up the segment graph where instead of the general link node representation the smallest parts of the network that can be isolated i e segments become the graph nodes and the regarding iso valves are the links between them the importance of the analysis of the segment graph in terms of reliability was first presented in walski 1993 there are two different approaches in the literature for building the segment graph breadth first search and depth first search see barabÃ¡si 2016 li and kao 2008 for details based on these ideas several different algorithms were developed recently for wdns e g alvisi et al 2011 jun and loganathan 2007 giustolisi and savic 2010 creaco et al 2010 showed different methods for the identification of segment graph and also suggested methods for the optimal layout of the iso valves since the size of the hydraulic models is continuously increasing the efficiency of these algorithms might be a critical issue thus gao 2014 presented an efficient method and demonstrated it using a wdn containing 70k pipelines the results in this paper were obtained by a depth first search based approach which is similar to the one published in huzsvÃ¡r et al 2019 fig 2 demonstrates the steps of the algorithm using epanet s test network net1 in which five iso valves are present first the iso valves are removed see inset 2 then starting from the first node of the system the algorithm finds every connecting node inset 3 once it is unable to reach yet unvisited nodes it verifies that every node of the current segment has been discovered and the next node is selected that is not part of the already visited segments inset 4 this mapping repeats until every component of the network has been assigned to a segment inset 5 the last step is the identification of the iso valve placements the algorithm connects two segments with a link if the segments are having a mutual iso valve e g in fig 2 valve a connects segments s1 and s2 3 topological properties complex network theory is a new research area born around the end of the last millennium allowing scientists to analyse large graphs containing thousands or even tens of thousands of edges or nodes e g internet actor network or protein interactions see barabÃ¡si 2016 a significant discovery in this field was that most of the real life networks cannot be approximated accurately by the traditional random network models proposed by erdÅs and rÃ©nyi 1959 but realistic networks are often scale free barabÃ¡si and albert 1999 meaning that most of the nodes are negligible they can be removed without significantly affecting the behaviour of the network but there also exist hubs where edges tend to accumulate rendering them critical in terms of the connectivity of the graph albert et al 2001 analysed how these networks both random and scale free behave against errors and attacks they have found that the latter one scale free is significantly more vulnerable since the loss of hubs could easily provoke the topological detachment of the network into several subgraphs such features are also important from the practical point of view the loss of some critically important parts of the electrical network caused the new york city blackout in 1977 during the investigation of the behaviour of real networks e g albert et al 1999 estrada 2006 numerous methods and algorithms were developed which are used in the area of utility systems as well based on the topology structural properties are evaluated for real life or artificial wdns e g ky networks jolly et al 2014 to understand their overall operation yazdani and jeffrey 2011 to design extensions yazdani et al 2011 to quantify the robustness yazdani and jeffrey 2012 or to identify the critical components diao et al 2014 some papers are attempting to discover a quantitative relationship between a purely topological parameter and the hydraulics see pandit and crittenden 2016 meng et al 2018 torres et al 2016 these techniques are valuable for the designers of wdns since some aspects of the network can be approximated as early as during the planning phase without a detailed hydraulic model as building such models require an enormous amount of data e g gis data and engineering work most of the works in the literature are using the general pipe node representation as a graph for the wdn even in the case of analysing the robustness resilience or vulnerability however this study follows the idea from walski 1993 and analyses the segment valve approach since the focus of the paper is to investigate the general effect of a single accidental pipe break that is a loss of a node in the segment graph the main goal is to explore the general behaviour of the real life wdns in terms of their segment graph 3 1 degree distribution of the segment graph of real life wdns in the field of graph theory the degree of a node is the number of edges connecting trough that node node degree can also be defined for directed graphs however in this study we are considering only undirected networks as water can flow in both directions of a pipe the degree distribution pk provides the probability that a randomly selected node in the network has degree k since pk is a probability it must be a normalized quantity i e p k 1 traditionally real networks were assumed to be random graphs which degree distribution follow poisson distribution however in recent years it was revealed that the degree distribution of certain real life networks is following power law see barabÃ¡si 2016 and this behaviour is called scale free the main difference is that the latter ones scale free have a relatively high probability for containing nodes with a high degree called hubs that are critical in terms of the connectivity of such networks the degree distribution of a random graph is typically modelled using the poisson distribution at the same time a scale free network follows a power law distribution i e it is linear in the case of a log log scale see fig 3 for the purposes of this study we collected 27 comprehensive real life wdns from western hungary the main properties can be observed in table 1 as it can be seen they cover a wide range from the smallest one with only twelve segments to the largest one that provides hundreds of cubic meter per hour of drinking water the average number of the isolation valves in one kilometre is 5 45 while the median is 5 which seems low compared to 12 that was found by walski 2011 for 13 real life wdns this implies that the isolation valves are much sparser located throughout the networks in the case of the segment graph of a wdn the degree of a segment indicates how many iso valves are required to segregate that specific part of the network by applying the algorithm presented in the previous section the segment graphs were built for the wdns then the degree distributions of segment graphs were analysed in the case of an isolation it might happen that further segments of the network are segregated unintentionally e g closing a dead end line at the beginning while there are more segments downstream i e outage segments walski 1993 it can happen that not every isolation valve must be closed for proper segregation due to the connection of an outage segment however during this study it is still considered that all of the iso valves have to be closed for a proper segregation since it might also happen as a result of the geodetic differences that water is flowing backwards from an originally downstream segment fig 4 shows the results of the degree distributions of the segment graph of the 27 real life wdns as it can be seen the characteristics of these distributions are more similar to the poisson distribution the mean degree is 2 25 0 19 which means that on average to isolate a segment 2 25 number of iso valves must be closed the explanation behind this surprisingly low number compared to 2 55 found in walski et al 2006 lies behind two facts first a large amount of the segments are dead ends see fig 4 which only need one valve for shutdown and second the n rule liu et al 2017 is applied at most of the junctions this also seems contradictory to the low density of isolation valves per kilometre but the explanation is simply that our networks contain long straight pipelines and also in branches the n rule is followed analysing the segments with high degrees as it can be seen in the figure the maximum degree is seven and the numbers of segments with at least 4 degrees is less than 10 based on these results it can be summarised that these networks do not contain hubs which would be critically important in terms of the topological connectivity furthermore it seems that based on the degree distribution in terms of the topology the segment graph of real life wdns are behaving as robust random graphs rather than vulnerable scale free networks because random graphs does not contain nodes with high degree i e the segments in wdns can be isolated using only several valves 3 2 diameter and clustering coefficient the last decades brought numerous topological indicators for quantifying different behaviours of networks again we refer to barabÃ¡si 2016 which are already exploited in the field of wdns e g yazdani et al 2011 in this paper we are focusing on two of them namely the diameter and the clustering coefficient for the efficient calculation of these quantities the igraph toolbox csardi and nepusz 2012 was employed a path between two distinct nodes in a graph is the sequence of edges since typically for two nodes there are numerous different paths the shortest path is considered where the number of edges along the path is the smallest in the case of a network between every pair of nodes the shortest paths can be determined and the length of the longest shortest path is called the diameter of the graph this means that from any node of the network every other node can be reached while the number of edges along the path included is below or in some specific case equal to the diameter if the diameter of the network is small for a large network then the system might have a critical part in terms of the connectivity see yazdani and jeffrey 2011 a hub which connects a large part of the nodes since this indicator is able to predict the possible hubs in the network where connections tend to accumulate this quantity represents a strong relation with the network robustness and vulnerability for some special graph the diameter can be estimated e g in the case of a 2d grid like random network it is 2 n where n is the number of nodes barabÃ¡si 2016 however for a scale free system it can be approximated using log n log log n according to bollobÃ¡s and riordan 2004a the left side of fig 5 depicts these correlations and also the data points of real life wdns as it shows even the prediction of the random graph is slightly underestimates the diameter of real life wdns the second commonly analysed parameter is the clustering coefficient of a graph which characterises the average density of the graph i e closeness to the complete graph where every distinct pair of nodes is directly connected with a unique edge this quantity can be defined as the average number of the connections between the neighbours of an arbitrarily selected node in the network see meng et al 2018 therefore the clustering coefficient tend to be high in the case of a highly looped network while zero for a tree like system for a scale free network the clustering coefficient is expected to be high due to the hubs while for random networks it is expected to be close to zero this quantity can also be approximated for special cases for a random network we have k n where k is the average degree that is 2 25 for our wdns and for a scale free network log n 2 n see bollobÃ¡s and riordan 2004b the right side of fig 5 presents the results for the approximations with the results from the real life wdns the scale free estimation is clearly incorrect while the prediction from the random graph is significantly closer it also important to highlight that the clustering coefficient of 14 networks out of 27 equals to zero based on the results of diameter and clustering coefficient strictly from the topological point of view the segment graph of real life wdns behave similarly to random graphs rather than scale free networks this indicates that based on using only the previously described traditional complex network theory concepts the real life wdns are robust against random pipe failures however there are also differences on the one hand a segment graph of a wdn is necessarily connected i e there cannot be nodes segments separately from the main body of the system on the other hand it is essential that a wdn is a planar network i e edges cannot cross each other without a node which is not valid for random graphs in general in overall based on the degree distributions and the structural properties the segment graph of a wdn behaves like a connected planar random graph the corresponding literature on complex graph theory generally affirms that scale free networks are much more sensitive than random networks to attacks indicating that random networks are more robust see e g guillaume et al 2005 our result that is the wdn analysed here are similar to random graphs is counterintuitive in the sense that wdns are known to be vulnerable in the hydraulic sense even though there is an intentionally engineered redundancy in them for example isolation of central segments in the downtown change the system hydraulics completely or multiple pressure zones connected in series at the outer verges of the network might also be weak points 3 3 universal degree distribution function for real life wdns the purpose of the current subsection is to create a universal function which is able to approximate the degree distribution of the segment graph of a general real life wdn based on the degree distribution and the structural properties it seems that the segment graphs of wdns behave as random graphs thus one might fit the poisson distribution for describing the degree distribution in general however the fact that the topology of a wdn is planar by nature and every node is necessarily connected thus there are no nodes with zero edges i e there are no segments without iso valves these properties make this approach unsuitable for example if one would like to describe a wdn using a poisson distribution with average degree of 2 25 more than 10 of the nodes would have zero degrees due to these difficulties another idea came up to create a general function for the approximation of the degree distributions the function was defined by taking the average of the relative frequencies at each degree for numerical values see table 2 that is still a distribution function i e the sum is equal to one this fitted function also the poisson distribution can be observed in fig 6 with the real life wdns a statistical hypothesis test namely chi squared test see montgomery and runger 2003 was performed for the investigation of the results homogeneity i e it was analysed whether the degree distributions of the real life wdns follow the same distribution as the fitted function or as the poisson in the case of 95 of significance level 85 precisely 23 out of 27 of the wdns follows the fitted function while that is only 51 14 out of 27 for the latter one based on these calculations the degree distributions of real life wdns segment graph follow a unique distribution and most of the analysed wdns within these ranges of system properties see table 1 can be described by this fitted function the practical benefit of this degree function is twofold on the one hand this could be a basis for comparison for different wdns especially coming from outside of hungary or even outside of europe it would be interesting to see if other wdns share the same property on the other hand this could be a guideline for wdn planner for judging the location of isolation valves if the distribution for a wdn is dominated by low degree that is most of the segments can be isolated by one or two iso valves the system is more robust but if there are numerous segments with high degree operating problems might arise due to the need of shutting several iso valves see also huzsvÃ¡r et al 2019 4 vulnerability of wdns in the previous decades numerous publications focused on the quantification of the resilience todini 2000 reliability zhuang et al 2013 or vulnerability shuang et al 2014 of different type of networks the main goal in the literature is to properly define a parameter that describes these aspects of wastewater sweetapple et al 2018 networks urban drainage systems wang et al 2019 water resources infrastructure porse and lund 2016 or as in our case wdns diao et al 2016 the idea is to define a quantity which is able to characterise the behaviour of networks from a selected aspect hence it could support decision making in the case of new network design or during network condition analysis even if these networks are serving different purposes analogous ideas are applied in the literature e g the resilience analysis was used in mugume et al 2015 for the investigation of urban flooding and in diao et al 2016 for wdns a review article was presented in hosseini et al 2016 about the resilience analysis of several different types of networks these publications strengthen the attitude that applying ideas from neighbouring research areas might lead to novel results while numerous studies were dealing with the question of resilience reliability or risk analysis of the different type of utility networks this paper analyses the vulnerability of the segment graphs of wdns the goal of our study is to discover the average behaviour of wdns in a single accidental pipe break therefore in this approach it is considered that the probability of a possible pipe burst is equal throughout the system i e every meter of pipelines has the same chance to break this methodology can be extended by weighting the probability using data of the wdns e g if there is a network specific connection between the frequency of pipe bursts and the material of the pipeline a case study can be performed with increased accuracy during this study we assumed that every isolation valve is properly operating thus for the isolation of a single pipe break only one segment must be depressurised important to mention that for the analysis of a specific real life network this hypothesis might not be thorough and the topic of improperly working isolation valves can also be a research area abdel mottaleb and walski 2020 liu et al 2017 although some papers gheisi and naser 2014 jacobs and goulter 1991 sweetapple et al 2019 are suggesting that pipe or node failures tend to accumulate this study focuses on a single segment loss that is originating from a single pipe break finally the nominal demands of the real life wdns are calculated based on the billing system and yearly averages are defined again the purpose of the study is to discover the overall behaviour of a wdn in an accidental pipe break the method can be extended in this aspect as well by taking into consideration e g adjusting the demands using specific pattern daily weekly or monthly thus performing a detailed analysis on certain cases 4 1 definition of vulnerability maiolo et al 2018 reviewed a few different definitions of vulnerability from the literature and most of them are based on topological approaches the goal of the vulnerability according to the definition in this paper is to catch the general hydraulic behaviour of wdns in a single pipe break thus it is based on the hydraulic model important that most of the vulnerability definitions from the literature belongs either to pipelines or nodes while this paper is focusing on segments similarly to abdel mottaleb and walski 2020 as a results every element from a segment is having the same vulnerability since every failure is causing the loss of the whole segment the quantity is also dimensionless thus it can be applied for comparing wdns with different sizes first the length of every pipeline in the ith segment is denoted by li typically there are several pipelines in one segment also it is normalized using the overall pipe length throughout the network li thus Î» i l i l i this Î»i quantity denotes the relative pipeline length and it also indicates the failure rate of the ith segment second the amount of drinking water that cannot be provided in the case of the segregation of the ith segment is calculated by the 1d hydraulic solver i e b i d i c i where di indicates the nominal demand and ci represents the actual amount of served water according to the model for calculating this one must be able to cope with a demands cannot be served inside the isolated segment b there might be some parts of the network that are segregated unintentionally i e outage segments furthermore c even in the case if a segment is topologically connecting to the main network the hydraulic conditions might change on a scale and the pressure of a segment drops drastically that it is not capable of providing enough water to fulfil the nominal demand i e the hydraulic solver must be able to handle pressure dependent consumptions the bi variable is also normalized using the overall nominal demand i e Î² i b i d i this shows the relative loss in the overall nominal demand which is caused by the isolation of the ith segment this quantity is similar to the demand shortfall in watergems see liu et al 2017 but analogous parameters can be determined with other commercially available software as well e g mike urban pipe criticality using the previously defined quantities the local vulnerability Î³i of the network with respect to the ith segment is 6 Î³ i Î» i Î² i this parameter is dimensionless and segment specific moreover it is a product of the failure rate Î»i and the relative loss Î²i caused by the ith segment failure according to this definition the vulnerability is high if a segment both contains a significant amount of pipelines and causes a considerable amount of loss in the provided drinking water in the case of its isolation if there is a segment e g close to the major input point where most of the drinking water is supplied i e Î²i is high but there are only a few meters of pipes Î»i is small the vulnerability might be lower compared to a segment with hundreds meters of pipelines Î»i is high and with an average loss in consumption Î²i is moderate also in the opposite case if there are long pipelines in a segment but the loss caused to the consumptions is negligible e g this part is a dead end of the network the vulnerability might be still small to perform a thorough analysis for the behaviour of wdns every possible scenario was simulated i e the affect of isolation of every segment was individually calculated applying this definition for the vulnerability is already a valuable tool in order to unveil the critical areas of a wdn and the network can be colourised according to local vulnerabilities fig 7 shows an example of this where several critically vulnerable segments are revealed for the improvement of the wdn one might consider increasing the number of iso valves in these areas to reduce the local vulnerabilities 4 2 scale free nature of wdns during the examination of the spatial maps of local vulnerabilities it was revealed that in each wdn there are only a few critical segments while the rest of the networks is far less exposed therefore a detailed analysis was performed on the distributions of local vulnerabilities by drawing the probability density function pdf montgomery and runger 2003 or also called frequency distribution this representation is similar to the histogram but there are also some differences as we are plotting sampled data instead of a continuous variable the main advantage of this graphical illustration compared to the traditional statistical metrics e g average standard deviation or box plot that it depicts the small details by indicating the dispersion between the minimum and maximum values of the data structure moreover it is capable of visualising the number and the location of stagnation points where the data points tend to accumulate and it also unveils the elementary tendencies of the data and highlights the connections of the values the steps of creating such a graph are the following first the whole range between the minimum and the maximum values were split into r number of bins where r n s e g if nseg 100 and r log 2 n s e g 1 otherwise where nseg is the number of segments this means that each network is represented using r number of points in the diagram that is between four and ten for these wdns second the boundaries of the bins were defined by sorting the same amount of data into each bin i e the frequencies were equally distributed third while determining the y coordinate of each point it is considered that the product of the horizontal width of the interval and the height of the point is equal to the relative frequency i e these points share the same size of areas which ensures that the cumulative distribution function which is the integral of the pdf tends to 1 as x tends to infinity fig 8 depicts the sampled probability density function of local vulnerabilities Î³i see eq 6 for 27 real life wdns using log log scale note that almost every wdn contains some segments with zero vulnerabilities which means that the isolation of these parts will not affect the consumption at all because there is no demand within the segment and the looped network can fulfil the water need of downstream segments these are not interpreted during the analysis of the distribution of local vulnerabilities because it is not possible to visualise the zero values on a log log scale we define highly vulnerable segments as those ones whose local vulnerability exceeds 10 2 meaning that e g probability failure is 10 and the segment 10 of the demands is lost if the segment needs to be isolated another segment with 50 of failure probability and 2 of demand loss would also be deemed as vulnerable by definition a segment is moderately vulnerable if its local vulnerability is above than 10 3 that is in average it includes 3 15 of pipes and supplies 3 15 of the overall consumption obviously these thresholds are artificial and might be argued the points are located along a linear line that implies power law probability distribution which indicates similar behaviour to the scale free networks due to the nature of a scale free network it contains critical nodes with high degree hub which might be significantly higher than the average and the loss of a hub could lead to the detachment of the network as fig 8 depicts the local vulnerabilities wdns also include segments with high vulnerability see highly vulnerable region that implies that during the loss of such a segment serious outage in water service might occur besides the highly vulnerable segments some parts of the networks can be found in the moderately vulnerable region and most segments can be considered negligible in terms of vulnerability the linear trend that is power law probability distribution also highlights that a large part of the network is slightly or not at all vulnerable some regions are moderately vulnerable but most importantly there will be a few segments that are highly vulnerable distribution of household incomes there are very few billionaires but the bulk of the population holds modest financial resources or magnitude of earthquakes follow similar distribution for example in the case of network 8 the probability of a randomly picked segment having larger vulnerability than 10 2 i e it is highly vulnerable is more than 5 meaning that more than 5 of the segments are highly exposed in overall this method is able to emphasise the magnitude differences in the vulnerability of segments i e it can highlight the most exposed parts of the network due to the highly inhomogeneous distribution of local vulnerabilities 4 3 analysing the network vulnerabilities besides the importance of the local distribution of vulnerabilities inside a network it is also useful to evaluate the overall quality of a network from the viewpoint of vulnerability for comparison with other wdns thereby the decision making of the utility company can be supported in the optimal allocation of reconstruction and development resources therefore the network vulnerability is introduced which is the sum of local vulnerabilities that is 7 Î³ i Î² i l i i l i i Î² i Î» i i Î³ i this is the weighted average of the local consumption outages i e Î³ is the expected value of the amount of water loss in the case of a single accidental pipe break according to the hydraulic model fig 9 provides the result obtained by the vulnerability analysis of the 27 wdn via box plot as it can be seen most network vulnerability values are under 0 2 however there are three networks where the Î³ value exceeds 0 4 outliers this means that these networks are highly vulnerable compared to the rest of the sample and during a random segment loss all over the system the expected value of unserved demand is above 40 obviously this is a statistical analysis and does not mean that if a pipe breaks anywhere in the system 40 will be lost but gives an aggregated expected value of the severeness of a random pipe failure these outlier networks need a scrutiny to unveil the origin of this high possible outage in the service of demands 5 conclusions this paper presented the analysis of the vulnerability of wdns with respect to a single random pipe burst an algorithm was introduced that is capable of creating the segment graph of a wdn efficiently where the edges are the isolation iso valves and the segments containing several pipes are the nodes a segment wise measure of local vulnerability was defined as the product of the relative pipeline length that is proportional to the probability of pipe burst and the relative amount of unfulfilled demand in the case of the shutdown of the segment thus those segments are considered as vulnerable that have a high probability of failure and the amount of lost demand is high the concept of network vulnerability was also introduced that quantifies the expected value of relative consumption that cannot be served due to a single accidental pipe break to test these novel concepts 27 real life wdns of hungary were used with a wide range of pipeline lengths overall demands and topology based on the results the following conclusions can be drawn the analysis of the degree distributions of the segment graphs unveiled that the number of hubs nodes with high degree is negligible most parts of the wdns can be segregated by closing not more than 3 iso valves and the average is 2 25 based on this and the fact that the diameters in the sense of graph theory of these networks are large and the clustering coefficients are almost zero the behaviour of the segment graph of real life wdns is close to a random graph if only the topology is considered in other words strictly from the topological point of view the segment graph of a wdn is a planar connected random graph naively this would suggest that such networks are robust against random pipe burst an approximating degree distribution for the segment graph of real life wdns was provided and a statistical hypothesis test chi square test was performed in order to investigate whether the real distributions could be originated from the fitted one based on the test 85 of the wdns were accepted 23 out of 27 which means most of the degree distributions of the segment graph of wdns can described with this general function at least for the sample used in this study from the practical point of view this distribution can be utilised for comparing other networks especially during the design phase of new wdns and it can support decision making in terms of the number or location of isolation valves beyond purely topological analysis the proposed new measure for vulnerability exploits also the hydraulic properties of the network via pressure dependent demands our vulnerability indicator is objective free of user defined parameters dimensionless allows the comparison of different networks segment based and can be extended straightforward way towards non uniform failure distribution over the network by the detailed investigation of the probability density functions of these local vulnerabilities it was revealed that the behaviour of wdns is similar to the scale free networks in terms of its vulnerability that is most segments are slightly vulnerable while some parts segments are critical in terms of lost demand similar to hubs in a scale free network a pipe burst in one of these highly vulnerable segments of a wdn might lead to a serious outage in water service because either they contain a significant amount of demands or they transfer a large quantity of water the proposed network vulnerability parameter revealed that 3 wdns out of 27 have serious issues in terms of vulnerability because in the case of a random pipe break more than 40 of the demands cannot be served according to their hydraulic model as this parameter characterises the overall quality of the network it can support the decision making process in the distribution of reconstruction resources or upgrade capacities besides these conclusions there are some open questions and directions for further analysis and research in terms of the degree distributions it would be useful to test more real life wdns against our proposed function and explore whether they follow the same distribution this would be especially interesting in the case of wdns outside of hungary or europe as the results showed traditional graph tools such as degree distribution diameter clustering coefficient cannot reveal the scale free nature of wdn thus it would be useful from the practical point of view to find a purely topological parameter that does not require detailed hydraulic model that is capable of unveiling this aspect if such measure exists because setting up the hydraulic simulation requires significant effort in terms of the design of a new wdn one might consider building a new algorithm that is able to create a more favourable distribution of local vulnerabilities to avoid the highly exposed areas this might also be interesting for already existing systems by recreating the layout of the isolation valves it would also be straightforward to use the system vulnerability parameter as the objective function of an optimisation

17697,although anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbr are a core technology in the transition of urban wastewater uww treatment towards a circular economy the transition is being held back by a number of bottlenecks the dissolved methane released from the effluent the need to remove nutrients ideally by recovery or the energy lost by the competition between methanogenic and sulfate reducing bacteria srb for the biodegradable cod have been identified as the main issues to be addressed before anmbr becomes widespread mathematical modeling of this technology can be used to obtain further insights into these bottlenecks plus other valuable information for design simulation and control purposes this paper therefore proposes an anmbr anaerobic digestion model to simulate the crucial srb related process since these bacteria degrade more than 40 of the organic matter the proposed model which is included in the bnrm2 collection model has a reduced but all inclusive structure including hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis methanogenesis and other srb related processes it was calibrated and validated using data from an anmbr pilot plant treating sulfate rich uww including parameter values obtained in off line experiments and optimization methods despite the complex operating dynamics and influent composition it was able to reproduce the process performance in fact it was able to simulate the ad of sulfate rich uww considering only two groups of srb heterotrophic srb growing on both vfa propionate and acetate and autotrophic srb growing on hydrogen besides the above mentioned constraints the model reproduced the dynamics of the mixed liquor solids concentration which helped to integrate biochemical and filtration models it also reproduced the alkalinity and ph dynamics in the mixed liquor required for assessing the effect of chemical precipitation on membrane scaling keywords anaerobic membrane bioreactor bnrm2 modeling sulfate rich urban wastewater 1 introduction anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbr have attracted attention to drive the shift of urban wastewater uww treatment towards the circular economy this technology combines the advantages of anaerobic systems with membrane filtration i it retains 100 of particulate materials allowing accurate control of the sludge retention time srt thus preventing slow growing methane forming methanogens to be washed out of the system while producing high quality solids and pathogen free effluent ii it enables ad to be operated at ambient temperatures by increasing the srt iii it reduces biosolid waste because of the lower biomass yields of anaerobic microorganisms and iv it transforms organics into a gaseous energy carrier ch4 lei et al 2018 maaz et al 2019 robles et al 2018a shin and bae 2018 anmbr does not destroy nutrients and produces a nutrient loaded high quality effluent useful for nutrient recovery e g struvite crystallization microalgae cultivation and fertirrigation among others chen 2020 guo et al 2016 raskin et al 2012 indeed optimizing anmbr design and operations by the assessment of environmental economic and technological trade offs enables ad to be operated cost effectively with a significant reduction in costs and environmental impact while being a net energy producer unlike conventional aerobic uww treatments combined with waste sludge ad mei et al 2016 pretel et al 2016 however this application still presents some issues that need further consideration such as i the methane concentration dissolved in the effluent which has to be captured to maximize energy harvesting and avoid direct greenhouse gas ghg emissions downstream cookney et al 2016 crone et al 2016 sanchis perucho et al 2020 ii the need for a post treatment step for nutrient recovery within the circular economy robles et al 2020 ye et al 2020 or iii the reduced energy harvested due to the competition between methanogens and sulfate reducing bacteria srb for the available substrate when treating uww with low biodegradable organics to sulfate ratios bod so42 s see e g gimÃ©nez et al 2012b lens et al 1998a pretel et al 2014 although anmbr has been put forward as a core technology for the sustainable treatment of different waste streams it is necessary to thoroughly explore the role and impact of its drawbacks before its widespread application anmbr modeling can offer a number of advantages in this field including the analysis of technical economic and environmental feasibility technology development or model based design since it has not yet been implemented full scale for uww treatment the design issues are particularly important as they finally determine capital costs operating costs and technical viability anaerobic digestion ad modeling is a mature field largely guided by mechanistic model structures defined by understanding the underlying processes batstone et al 2015 the most widely used ad model to describe sludge stabilization is the well known iwa adm1 batstone et al 2002 which has been applied to modeling a large number of ad processes donoso bravo et al 2011 however the model calibration and validation can be somewhat complex for modeling certain substrates the modeling goal should define the complexity level of the model to be selected in order to obtain useful information donoso bravo et al 2011 e g understanding metabolic pathways evaluating effluent quality assessing biogas production and quality evaluating membrane fouling etc for instance simulating methane production or effluent quality in a system treating low strength wastewater such as uww may require less data on the metabolic pathways for organic degradation than the treatment of high strength wastewaters while the degradation of more complex substrates e g food waste could require expanded existing models one issue of ad modeling deals with selecting and adapting models capable of reproducing the performance of new anaerobic processes such as anmbr robles et al 2018b the model parameters should be optimized specifically for anmbr technology since membrane filtration can control srt while modifying the organic loading rate olr thus affecting the limiting or controlling mechanisms during ad data from an existing anmbr system would allow specific parameters to be tuned also well balanced model complexity and usability is essential for anmbrs e g one of the key issues is the type of particle treated i e biomass and solid substrate since it affects membrane performance the kinetic structure of the biological model should be relatively simple at least two step but complex enough to represent the behavior of the particles in the system batstone 2006 different modifications are available for adapting adm1 to different processes batstone et al 2006 2015 zaher et al 2007 kythreotou et al 2014 several authors have proposed simpler modeling approaches e g charfi et al 2017 developed a mathematical model for anmbr simulation coupling a simplified anaerobic model and another for membrane fouling the bnrm2 collection model proposed by barat et al 2013 incorporates a simplification of adm1 in a general model linked to a an anmbr filtration model robles et al 2013b although sulfate reducing processes are not incorporated in barat et al 2013 bnrm2 considers the most important physical chemical and biological processes taking place in wwtps the physical processes considered are sedimentation and gas liquid transfer and the chemical are acid base reactions considered as equilibrium governed processes and precipitation and redissolution processes the bacterial groups considered are heterotrophic two groups of ammonium oxidizing k strategist and r strategist nitrite oxidizing polyphosphate accumulating acidogenic acetogenic and two groups of methanogenic acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic copp et al 2005 presented an ad sub model model extracted from the mantis collection model on gps x software which also includes an anmbr module aquino and stuckey 2008 incorporated soluble microbial products smps and extracellular polymeric substances epss in a reduced model architecture due to the accumulation of smps inside ad systems and their effect on other downstream processes such as membrane filtration the am2b anaerobic model proposed by benyahia et al 2013 a modification of the simple two step am2 model bernard et al 2001 incorporates smp production and degradation pathways to allow integration with a filtration sub model however anaerobic models applied to anmbrs are usually developed or validated for the treatment of high strength wastewater modeling the amount of methane dissolved in the effluent is essential to evaluate and optimize the economic and environmental feasibility of ad systems for sewage treatment especially when operating at low temperatures since the amount of methane that is lost in the effluent can increase by up to 80 when operating at temperatures below 15 c gimÃ©nez et al 2014 a post treatment step for nutrient removal and or recovery might be needed depending on the sensitivity of the receiving water body accurately determining effluent quality is thus essential for designing classical or advanced techniques for nutrient removal or recovery such as an ammox process membrane contactors bioelectrochemical systems microalgae cultivation phototrophic bacteria cultivation fertirrigation ion exchange ammonia stripping etc robles et al 2020 modeling sulfate reduction in ad systems is also essential to assess uww methane production with low biodegradable organics to sulfate ratios bod so4 2 s where competition between methanotrophs and srb may be a key phenomenon the most popular anaerobic models dealing with srb are usually complex and the information contained in parameter values and model structure does not translate well to simple design rules batstone 2006 other authors have modelled these processes at lower complexity levels by proposing different numbers of srb activities and electron donors cassidy et al 2015 as commented before selecting complexity levels depends on the modeling goal e g understanding metabolic pathways or evaluating biogas production and quality for instance different models with a limited number of srb pathways have been proposed to simulate the competition between methanogens and srb for acetate fomichev and vavilin 1997 acetate and hydrogen ahammad et al 2011 harerimana et al 2013 or simply hydrogen batstone 2006 increasing the number of srb pathways knobel and lewis 2002 considered five groups of srb consuming butyrate lactate propionate acetate and hydrogen frunzo et al 2012 also considered five groups of microbes heterotrophic srb autotrophic srb homoacetogenic bacteria methanogenic archaea and acetate degrading bacteria and kalyuzhnyi and fedorovich 1998 proposed seven srb groups up to four srb groups consuming butyrate propionate acetate and hydrogen were incorporated in the adm1 by ahmed and rodrÃ­guez 2018 2017 barrera et al 2015 fedorovich et al 2003 and most of these models were developed and validated in ad systems treating high strength wastewaters due to the low bod so4 2 s srb modeling is essential for mainstream ad technology development although fedorovich et al 2003 and other authors have presented useful extensions to the adm1 for sulfate reduction these extensions usually include several processes that complicate model implementation and usability apart from having been developed for high strength wastewater indeed the simplification proposed by batstone et al 2002 aims to avoid these complexities by assessing sulfate reduction and only considering the oxidation of available hydrogen by adding hydrogen and bicarbonate as separate states this simplified approach was validated at so4 2 s bod ratios of up to approximately 0 1 gs g 1cod after which hydrogen is depleted at higher so4 2 s bod ratios srb starts to oxidize organic acids and other metabolic pathways are needed thus a compromise between complexity and usability is needed for modeling mainstream ad systems treating wastewaters characterized by low bod so4 2 s ratios such as sulfate rich uww it is also necessary to adequately reproduce physicochemical dynamics e g gas flow chemical equilibrium and ph calculation in order to account for other processes affecting anmbr such as chemical precipitation and membrane scaling in contrast to other ad systems gas assisted anmbr systems are usually operated under gas saturation so that gas flow calculations are essential to evaluate the dissolved gas content in the effluent dissolved methane should be recovered in downstream processes to enhance the viability of full scale anmbr for uww treatment apart from biogas production adequate representation of saturation and oversaturation of liquid streams is essential in mainstream ad processes ph has a strong impact on carbon dioxide transfer mineral solids precipitation and biological conversions the concentrations of ionic species acids and bases in equilibrium with ionic active state variables can also be calculated from this equilibrium precipitation calculations are possible which is essential to evaluate problems related to membrane scaling or the potential nutrient recovery from the effluent in downstream processes therefore comprehensive ph and equilibrium prediction is needed to evaluate the feasibility of different treatment platforms for resource recovery deepening the understanding of the mechanistic processes involved could also expand anmbr applicability to address new challenges such as combining anmbr with other technologies for the recovery of resources and it is expected to be combined with new or existing technologies for uww treatment e g primary settling activated sludge processes for nutrient removal etc the integration of anmbr anaerobic models into plant wide or collection models would help to develop new resource recovery platforms which would assist in selecting the best treatment scheme and optimal operational conditions by considering a variety of technological solutions for resource recovery and nutrients removal seco et al 2020 for example solon et al 2019 evaluated the effects on plant performance of combining techniques to recover resources from wastewater other examples are available setting down the rules to assist in the conception and design of new schemes fernÃ¡ndez arÃ©valo et al 2017 lizarralde et al 2019 martÃ­ et al 2017 different studies are also available comparing this technology with conventional technologies for instance pretel et al 2016 contrasted the performance of an anmbr combined with a nutrient removal post treatment with different aerobic based wastewater treatment schemes using a plant wide model becker et al 2017 put forward anmbr and high rate activated sludge hras combined with ad for the co digestion of domestic wastewater and food waste last but not least adequate resource recovery modeling platforms would help model based control development of non linear processes making it possible to develop and test new control and optimization strategies although bnrm2 is a collection model it fails to simulate the anmbr performance when treating sulfate rich uww in this case the model overestimates methane production since the srb are not considered in this context this paper proposes the bnrm2s a modified version of the bnrm2 plant wide model barat et al 2013 which can be applied to different anaerobic systems for sulfate rich uww treatment such as anmbr bnrm2 has a reduced comprehensive structure for the anaerobic degradation of organics including hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis methanogenesis and the effect of influent sulfate on process performance the model is implemented on desass software ferrer et al 2008 and was calibrated and validated by data from an anmbr plant with industrial scale membranes the paper also gives an overview of current and future challenges in anmbr modeling 2 material and methods 2 1 anmbr pilot plant the proposed model was calibrated and validated by data from an anmbr pilot plant at the barranco del carraixet wwtp in alboraya valencia spain the anmbr consisted of a 1 3 m3 jacketed anaerobic reactor connected to two 0 8 m3 membrane tanks each membrane tank included one commercial ultrafiltration hollow fiber membrane system kms pur psh31 0 03 Î¼m pores 31 m2 filtration area a rotofilter with a screen size of 0 5 mm was installed as pre treatment one equalization tank 0 3 m3 and one clean in place tank 0 2 m3 were also included as main elements of the pilot plant a fraction of the produced biogas was continuously recycled to the anaerobic reactor in order to improve the stirring conditions and to favor stripping the produced gases from the liquid phase while another fraction was continuously recycled to the bottom of the hollow fiber membranes to minimize cake layer formation a degassing vessel was installed between each membrane tank and its vacuum pump to recover bubbles of biogas in the permeate a temperature control system was implemented consisting of a warm water tank equipped with a 6 kw heater and a thermostat that maintained the water at 65 c when necessary the temperature in the anaerobic reactor was controlled by a water pump that enabled the warm water to flow through the reactor jacket according to the difference between the reactor and set point temperatures further details of this anmbr pilot plant can be found in gimÃ©nez et al 2011 2 2 anmbr pilot plant monitoring different on line sensors and monitoring equipment were installed in the plant to obtain real time information on the state of the process such as gas flow rate transmitters vortex type in the gas inlets to anaerobic reactor and membrane tanks one gas pressure transmitter gauge pressure type which monitored the gas pressure in the head of the reactor one ph t and one orp sensor in the anaerobic reactor internal sludge recycling one biogas analyzer to monitor biogas composition ch4 co2 h2 and h2s and one gas meter pulse measurement to monitor biogas production besides the on line process monitoring the following parameters were determined to monitor plant performance total and soluble

according to standard methods apha 2005 nt was determined with commercial total nitrogen cell tests 114537 merck millipore vfa and alk concentration was determined by titration according to the method proposed by moosbrugger et al 1992 the concentration of dissolved methane in the effluent was indirectly determined through the static headspace gas chromatography analysis technique described by gimÃ©nez et al 2012b biogas composition was monitored with an emmerson process analytical gmbh x stream multiple purpose multiparametric gas analyzer after sample conditioning non dispersive infrared and ultraviolet and termoconductivity analyzers were used for ch4 and co2 h2 and h2s respectively 2 4 anmbr plant operation the plant was continuously operated for 2 5 years with effluent from the pre treatment of the carraixet full scale wwtp valÃ¨ncia spain the pre treatment step of the full scale facility consisted of screening and sand and grease removal after an additional pre treatment of the wastewater in a sieve screw and homogenization in an equalization tank the wastewater was pumped to the anaerobic reactor the average characterization of the influent during the experimental period is shown in table 1 the influent wastewater was characterized by a notably low bod so4 2 s ratio mean 3 6 1 97 kg bod kg 1 so4 s as well as a highly variable load which enabled calibrating and validating model performance under a wide range of influent conditions fig 1 shows the evolution during the experimental period of the srt the hydraulic retention time hrt and the temperature as this figure shows the entire experimental period was divided into 13 operating periods periods i to xiii in which the operating conditions were srt 20 70 days olr 0 5 2 kg cod m3 d 1 and hrt 5 24 h temperature ranged from 14 to 33 c the anmbr was firstly operated at a controlled temperature of 33 and 20 c days 1 150 and 200 400 respectively while the system was mostly operated at ambient temperature the temperature controller was switched off from day 400 to the end of the experimental period see fig 1 an in depth analysis of the experimental data used in this study can be found in gimÃ©nez et al 2014 2012a 2012b 2011 the mixed liquor from the anaerobic reactor was continuously recycled through the membrane tanks in which the effluent was obtained by vacuum filtration a fraction of the biogas produced in the system was recycled to the reactor for stirring purposes through fine bubble diffusers biogas recycling flow to the reactor was around 0 5 nm3 per m3 of working volume another fraction was recycled to the membrane tanks for membrane scouring for its additional gas stripping effect the specific gas demand per membrane area was around 0 2 0 3 nm3 h per m2 of membrane further details on membrane performance can be found elsewhere see e g robles et al 2014 this stirring strategy favored the mass transfer of dissolved gases between the liquid and gas phases thus avoiding oversaturation of methane in the effluent gimÃ©nez et al 2012b 2 5 model description this paper describes an extended version of the ad sub model included in the bnrm2 collection model barat et al 2013 including srb related processes the ad sub model has a reduced but comprehensive structure based on hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis all the model components and model notations are defined following the standard nomenclature proposed by corominas et al 2010 the soluble components considered in the ad sub model are the following fermentable readily biodegradable substrate not including vfa sf fermentation products expressed as propionate excluding acetate svfa acetate sac dissolved hydrogen sh2 dissolved methane sch4 total inorganic carbon consisting of co2 hco3 and co3 2 sig c inert soluble organic material su total proton concentration including free protons and those associated with acidic components sh ammonium plus ammonia nitrogen snhx and orthophosphates spo4 minteqa2 is used to calculate the equilibrium which includes the calculation of ionic species the particulate components considered are the following inert particulate organic material xu particulate biodegradable organic material xcb acidogenic bacteria xao acetogenic bacteria xpro methanogenic acetoclastic organisms xaco methanogenic hydrogenotrophic organisms xhmo and total suspended solids xtss due to the reduced complexity of the substrate to be consumed sulfate rich uww only two groups of srb were considered heterotrophic srb growing on both vfa propionate and acetate and autotrophic srb growing on hydrogen as regards sulfate reducing processes the extended bnrm2s model considers 4 new components split into 2 soluble and 2 particulates sulfate sso4 total sulfide ss heterotrophic srb xhsro and autotrophic srb xasro only one group of heterotrophic srb was considered since it was demonstrated in batch experiments data not shown that the srb that degrade both substrates should be considered as the same bacterial group srb that degrade fermentable readily biodegradable substrates sf were not considered since acidogenic bacteria outcompete this bacterial group widdel 1988 only two groups of srb were therefore introduced in the model heterotrophic srb are able to grow on acetate and propionate the catabolic reactions are shown in eqs 1 and 2 eq 1 ch 3 cooh so 4 2 2 co 2 2 h 2 o s 2 eq 2 ch 3 ch 2 cooh 7 4 so 4 2 3 co 2 3 h 2 o 7 4 s 2 since the extended model is able to calculate h2s concentration a non competitive inhibition term for this species was included in the kinetic expression of every growth process fig 2 shows a schematic representation of the biochemical processes included in the ad model extracted from the bnrm2s collection model including sulfate reducing processes the stoichiometry of the anaerobic sub model included in bnrm2s and the conversion factors to be applied to the continuity equations of the model for n p mass carbon and proton are available as e supplementary material table s1 and table s2 the kinetic expressions of the anaerobic sub model in bnrm2s are also provided as e supplementary material table s3 a surface limited reaction was assumed for the kinetic expressions of the hydrolysis process as usually considered in activated sludge models monod terms are used to model the growth limitation for substrate electron acceptor and nutrients non competitive inhibition terms were used to model thermodynamic inhibitions high hydrogen concentrations reduce the fermentation rate as well as the microbial inhibitions growth rate of all the bacterial groups are affected by the presence of hydrogen sulfide since it is assumed that svfa and sa are consumed simultaneously by srb competitive inhibition terms were included in the corresponding kinetic expressions the ph inhibition function denoted by iph1 consists of a combination of classical monod and non competitive inhibition switching functions barat et al 2013 seco et al 2004 eq 3 eq 3 i p h 1 s h k s h s h k i h k i h s h s h o p t k s h s h o p t k i h k i h s h o p t the kinetic expressions of the processes make it necessary to calculate the chemical equilibrium to obtain the concentration of given inorganic soluble components under its different species co2 h2s nh3 for this acid base and ion pairing reactions are included in the model as equilibrium governed processes this equilibrium is described by a set of non linear algebraic equations including one law of mass action for each specie formed in each equilibrium system eq 4 and one mass balance for each component eq 5 instead of using the charge balance for ph calculations the model considers a mass balance for the proton component i e total proton is a model component the software minteqa2 allison et al 1991 was used for equilibrium and ph calculations the mathematical formulation of minteqa2 can be summarized as follows see minteqa2 user s manual version 4 03 a system of n independent components that can be combined to form m species is represented by a set of mass action expressions in the form of eq 4 x i k i j 1 n c x j a i j i 1 2 n s p where x i is the activity of the ith specie x j is the activity of the jth specie a ij is the stoichiometric coefficient of the jth component in the ith specie see e supplementary material table s4 k i is the stability constant of the ith specie corrected for temperature variations with van t hoff equation n sp is the number of species considered and n c is the number of components in addition to the mass action expression the set of n independent components can be represented by n mass balance equations in the form of eq 5 t j i 1 n s p a i j c i j 1 2 n c where t j is the total concentration of component j calculated in the kinetic model and c i is the concentration of the ith specie equilibrium conditions are assumed the activity and concentration of every component or species are related through the corresponding activity coefficient which depends on the ionic strength davies equation eq 6 x i Î³ i c i i 1 2 n s p where Î³ i is the activity coefficient for the ith species equation 5 shows an example of the mass balance equations for the component nh4 eq 7 s n h x s n h 4 s n h 3 for more information on equilibrium ph calculation and simulation procedure see serralta et al 2004 the bnrm2 collection model including srb related processes was implemented on desass software ferrer et al 2008 which allows the user two possibilities for srt control i to establish the srt or ii to establish the sludge waste flow rate in the first case used for steady state simulations the software calculates the sludge waste flow rate required to maintain a selected srt taking into account the suspended solids concentration in the second case for dynamic simulations the software calculates the srt value the software can also set the retention capacity of the membrane to simulate different filtration technologies e g microfiltration and ultrafiltration in this work ultrafiltration was used thus complete retention of particulate compounds was considered the model can be linked to a previously developed filtration model applied to anmbr technology robles et al 2013b through the state variable xtss 2 6 model calibration the anmbr plant was continuously run under different operating conditions for 2 5 years to provide model development calibration and validation on line calibration was carried out using the pseudo steady state conditions reached at the end of periods ix and xii the parameters calibrated by this method were maximum growth rates decay rates temperature coefficients half saturation constants for substrate and electron acceptor biomass yields and parameters related to the hydrolysis process half saturation constants for nutrients and inhibition constants were obtained from the literature the main drawback of on line calibration is that system dynamics can be reproduced by different sets of parameter values so that off line lab experiments were also conducted to calibrate the main heterotrophic srb parameters by isolating specific heterotrophic srb related processes mainly based on sulfate reduction rate srr measurements these experiments provided information on the maximum srb activity under certain conditions including biomass concentration substrate and inhibitor concentrations and operating temperature different experiments were carried out at different temperatures using different initial substrate and sulfate concentrations to determine the yield of heterotrophic srb the sulfate half saturation constant and the acetate and propionate half saturation constants the temperature was controlled by a thermostated water bath during these experiments the time evolution of sulfate and vfa concentrations was measured since sulfide is oxidized to sulfate during the analytical procedure sulfide was precipitated to obtain accurate sulfate concentration measurements the constrained rosenbrock optimization method was applied to obtain the parameter values that were dynamically determined on line calibration the anmbr plant was simulated in an iterative process aimed at minimizing the sum of square relative errors the variables used for the optimization were soluble and total cod sulfate and sulfide effluent concentrations total and volatile suspended solids in the anmbr alkalinity biogas flow rate and biogas composition ch4 the simulations started with initial model parameter values from the literature and were modified in successive simulations according to the results obtained within the previously established range and stopped when the set precision was reached the tolerance criterion was set to 0 001 for each variable and the maximum number of iterations was set to 1500 for the optimization method the model parameter values obtained were used for validating the model under steady state and dynamic conditions the mass transfer coefficient for dissolved methane a c h 4 was obtained by establishing the dissolved methane concentration as the 102 of the saturation concentration when used to minimize membrane fouling gas sparging avoids methane supersaturation according to merkel and krauth 1999 the mass transfer coefficient for the rest of the gaseous species can be calculated from the methane coefficient using eq 6 eq 8 k l a c h 4 d i d c h 4 where kla i is the mass transfer coefficient of the gas i d 1 di is the diffusivity of the gas i 2 7 model validation five operating periods were selected for model validation under dynamic conditions periods ii vi ix x and xii covering a wide range of the main operational parameters srt varied between 20 and 70 days temperature between 20 and 33 c and hrt between 12 and 30 h the pseudo steady state conditions reached at the end of these periods were used to validate the steady state model these periods were simulated to verify that both the model and the calibrated parameters were able to reproduce the plant behavior in operating conditions other than those used for mathematical fitting 3 results and discussion 3 1 parameter calibration table 2 collects the stoichiometric and kinetic parameters resulting from the model calibration it should be noted that the parameters related to srb obtained a higher value for biomass yield than that obtained for the other bacterial groups also the significant difference between the half saturation constant for acetate 5 12 mg cod l 1 and propionate 29 4 mg cod l 1 the high biomass yield was due to the external electron acceptor used by srb which leads srb to outcompete methanogenic bacteria the low propionate concentrations usually present in the anmbr systems lead to acetogenic bacteria outcompeting heterotrophic srb because of the significant difference between half saturation constants for both bacterial groups 2 2 mg cod l 1 for xpro and 29 4 mg cod l 1 for xasro 3 2 steady state model performance table 3 shows the results of the simulation of the pseudo steady state conditions reached at the end of periods vi ix x and xii the comparison of the modelled and experimental data for the main characteristics of permeate waste sludge and biogas showed that the model was able to reproduce the anmbr performance in different steady state conditions 3 3 dynamic model performance to validate the model behavior in dynamic conditions five operating periods conducted at different srts 70 40 30 40 and 20 days were simulated periods ii vi ix x and xii respectively in these periods the main operational parameters were modified srt from 70 d to 40 d in period vi and from 30 d to 40 d in period x temperature from 15 c to 20 c in period ix and from 20 c to 30 c in period xi and hrt from 17 h to 11 h in period ii and from 15 h to 40h in period xi figs 3 5 show the experimental results obtained in the anmbr plant dashed lines compared to the model predictions continuous lines additional periods are provided as e supplementary material fig s1 and fig s2 fig 3 shows the simulation results for period ii during this period operating temperature and srt remained virtually constant while the hrt was gradually reduced from 17 to 11 h as fig 3a shows ts and vs increased in the mixed liquor due to the reduced hrt from day 70 80 approx there were peaks in olr see cod so4 2 s ratio in fig 3g which were reflected in the accumulation of vfa and ammonium see fig 3c and d respectively fig 3g also shows that the organic peak loads promoted the growth of both acidogenic xao and acetogenic xpro organisms the increased fermentation produced more hydrogen which was completely consumed by the autotrophic srb xasro as shown by the absence of hydrogenotrophic methanogens xhmo these results are in agreement with the expected trend since xasro gain more energy from hydrogen consumption and have higher substrate affinity maximum growth rate and biomass yield than xhmo see table 2 conversely organic peak loads resulted in a decrease of heterotrophic srb xhsro concentration since more sulfate was consumed by xasro the higher availability of acetate derived from the cod so4 2 s peaks and the reduced xhsro thus increased acetoclastic methanogen xamo concentration fig 4 gives the simulation results for period vi at the beginning of this period srt was reduced from 70 to 40 days mixed liquor vs and ts gradually dropped due to the increase in the waste sludge associated with the lower srt see fig 3a the lower srt and organic loading rate hrt was increased from 24 h to 34 h led to a reduced concentration of most of the bacterial groups srb being one of the most affected heterotrophics see fig 4g it is important to note the behavior between days 470 and 490 when high sulfate and low sulfide effluent concentrations were observed see fig 4e as a consequence of the low influent organic load which restricted sulfate reducing processes the sulfide produced was distributed among its different species depending on the ph according to lens et al 1998 only the first dissociation equilibrium of h2s is of important at neutral ph so that most of the sulfide produced was present either as the undissociated form h2s or the ionic species hs the concentration of s2 being negligible the undissociated form is presumably responsible for the inhibitory effect of sulfide since only uncharged molecules can permeate the cell membrane maree and strydom 1985 for instance for the operating temperature of period vi the pka of the first dissociation equilibrium of h2s is around 6 9 lens et al 1998 indicating that only the undissociated form h2s and the ionic species hs concentrations were significant specifically the anmbr ph during this period was around 6 9 resulting in h2s concentrations around 80 of the total sulfide produced fedorovich et al 2003 reported 50 inhibitory values of h2s k i h2s for several microbial groups considering first order inhibition kinetics see table 2 the most sensitive groups to h2s inhibition were hydrogenotrophic and acetotrophic methanogens xhmoand xaco respectively whose activity was half inhibited at h2s concentrations of 213 and 245 mg h2s s l 1 sulfate reducer activity was half inhibited at h2s concentrations of 265 mg h2s s l 1 sro and methanogenic activity was thus slightly inhibited during the experimental period fig 5 shows the simulation results for period x during which srt was raised from 30 to 40 days while ambient temperature remained around 20 c which increased solids concentration in the mixed liquor see fig 5a sulfate was not completely consumed by the srb at the beginning of period x see fig 5e during this period sulfate concentration rose to 139 mg so4 2 s l 1 while the average influent value was 108 mg so4 2 s l 1 the extra sulfate load in the system intensified the competition between srb and methanogens for the available substrates as a result of the reduced cod so4 2 s ratio initially the existing srb population was not able to completely consume the available sulfate however they gradually outcompeted the methanogens as shown by the shrinking biogas production and the rising xasro see fig 5b and g respectively this increase in influent sulfate concentration affected methane production and the influent flow was doubled between days 675 and 685 thus affecting both the loading rate entering the system and the extraction of compounds such as dissolved methane due to a significant decrease in the hrt the higher cod so4 2 s ratio between days 674 and 694 promoted the growth of xao xpro xasro and reduced the concentration of xhsro as in period ii the availability of acetate stimulated the growth of xaco sub plot g in figs 3 5 shows the population dynamics predicted by the model autotrophic sulfate reducers xasro outcompeted hydrogenotrophic methanogens xhmo since according to process fundamentals xasro gain more energy from hydrogen consumption and have higher substrate affinity growth rate and cell yield than xhmo lens et al 1998 indeed xhmo concentration was negligible during the whole experimental period and the electrons from the hydrogen produced were derived to sulfide rather than to methane proportionally reducing the uww methane potential sulfate was consumed preferentially by xasro as long as hydrogen and sulfate were present this is in agreement with the findings by laanbroek et al 1984 who reported autotrophic srb desulfovibrio spp having a higher affinity for the substrates than other heterotrophic srb desulfobulbus spp and desulfobacter spp under sulfate limited environments this is the reason why the concentration of heterotrophic sulfate reducers xhsro was inversely affected by the organic loading rate which enhanced hydrogen production via fermentation xhsro can metabolize a wide range of substrates and competed for the common substrates with acetogens xpro and acetoclastic methanogens xaco as long as sulfate was left from the autotrophic sulfate reduction the concentration of xpro remained virtually steady during each period indicating that xpro successfully competed with xhsro conversely in spite of the residual acetate derived methane production a decreasing trend was detected for xaco when sulfate was not limited low organic load episodes during summer periods vi and xii in any case xhsro were sulfate limited most of the time and it was completely reduced as long as the bod so4 2 s ratio was above the stoichiometric threshold 2 g bod g 1 s under sulfate limited conditions acetate electrons were also derived towards sulfide rather than to methane reducing the uww methane potential a lower methane potential entails a loss of energy efficiency for the system since less energy can be recovered either as power or heat 3 4 overall model performance the results of the model validation for all the variables evaluated throughout all the operating periods gave an overall r2 coefficient of 0 9966 see e supplementary material fig s3 which represents a scatter plot of the simulated values versus the experimental data the graph includes more than 1000 pairs of data showing the reproducibility of the model and the parameters fitted from experimental data collected from the pilot plant besides the operating dynamics srt hrt and t and influent characterization the model was able to accurately reproduce the process performance it should be noted that the model reproduced the solids concentration dynamics in the mixed liquor which is essential in anmbrs due to the need to integrate both biochemical and filtration models the ad sub model was coupled to a filtration model through the mixed liquor ts concentration also developed calibrated and validated with the data from the anmbr plant further details of the filtration model and the integration with the biochemical model can be found in robles et al 2014 2013b 2013a the model also faithfully reproduced the dynamics of both alkalinity and ph in the mixed liquor besides chemical precipitation also affecting membrane scaling alkalinity and ph affect species equilibrium and gas liquid transfer processes in this respect it is vital to minimize oversaturation of dissolved gases in the liquid phase which can be achieved by adequate reactor stirring optimization as ph also plays a key role in the equilibrium of other dissolved gases e g nh3 h2s between liquid and gas phases thus affecting the quality of the biogas produced accurate modeling of dissolved gas concentration and ph is needed to evaluate and optimize anmbr feasibility for uww treatment at ambient temperatures the simulation data satisfactorily represented experimental data related to srb processes which have a significant impact on the performance of the anmbr fed with sulfate rich uww results from other compounds such as vfa and methane production also accurately reproduced the interactions between srb and methanogens with a lower complexity level than other available models it was also able to capture the reduced biogas production from srb methanogens competition during low cod so4 2 s ratio events see fig 5b the model s population shift predictions showed that acidogenic bacteria concentrations were mainly dependent on the system s organic loading rate whose trend was accurately described by the cod so4 2 s ratio and the temperature which strongly affects the hydrolysis rate since hydrogen was mainly produced during fermentation the concentration of autotrophic srb followed the same trend the higher the concentration of xasro the higher the sulfate reduced autotrophically and the lower the xhsro concentration all the methane production was due to acetoclastic methanogens since hydrogenotropic methanogens were outcompeted by autrotropihc srb it should be noted that the model could require a widened structure depending for instance on the substrate degradation complexity or the objective of the modeling task in this respect ahmed and rodrÃ­guez 2018 also stated that complex model structures are only recommended for specific experimental cases these authors evaluated the complexity of five adm1 based model structures differing in the number of srb groups considered and based on the electron donors used their objective was to evaluate the accuracy of each modeling approach for different aims thus helping developers and users to decide on the appropriate degree of complexity required the results found that it is possible to simulate the ad of cane molasses with high cod and high sulfate feed even when only acetate utilizing and hydrogen utilizing srb are considered achieving a good performance complexity balance in terms of prediction errors against experimental data determining the biological complexity for the modeling goal particularly the inclusion of alternative electron sinks is thus a key issue while a benchmark modeling framework including standardized calibration protocols could be needed to deal with possible microbial ecology shifts affecting model accuracy 3 5 implications for anmbr implementation as already mentioned modeling sulfate reducing processes is a vital part of evaluating the feasibility of anmbr for uww treatment because of different factors modeling the amount of methane produced facilitates the design and selection of suitable approaches for dissolved methane capture or removal for the former degasification by non porous membranes and micro porous membrane contactors are promising technologies for dissolved methane recovery some authors have reported net energy recoveries when capturing the methane dissolved in anmbr effluents through membrane processes cookney et al 2016 henares et al 2017 while others obtained high nitrogen removal rates when using dissolved methane as the electron donor for denitrification in a post treatment process sÃ¡nchez ramÃ­rez et al 2015 pelaz et al 2018 concerning corrosion issues anmbr biogas contains variable amounts of h2s which can affect all biogas conversions and equipment the h2s concentration in the biogas was much higher than in conventional ad likely due to the much lower cod so4 2 s ratio in the uww than in other ad substrates e g sewage sludge the h2s content in the anmbr biogas ranged from around 10000 to 25000 ppm which were adequately reproduced by the model as the quality requirements depend on the use the biogas is to be put to acid biogas sweetening could be required according to the h2s tolerance of the chp technology used before it can be energetically valorized since h2s is transformed into highly corrosive sulfuric acid on combustion a post treatment step could be required for effluent nutrient removal or recovery depending on the characteristics of the receiving water body it could also be necessary to remove sulfide since it can be detrimental to downstream processes sulfide contributes to the effluent cod which has discharge limits in most countries last but not least recovery of dissolved methane which is an energy carrier with high global warming potential could help to reduce ghg emissions while enhancing the system s energy recovery potential which means it is essential to accurately reproduce effluent quality for designing classical or advanced techniques for nutrient sulfide or dissolved methane removal or recovery for instance the high quality nutrient loaded permeate produced makes it suitable for fertigation nevertheless when fertigation is limited by regulations a combination of anmbr with a nutrient recovery post treatment method can be used e g membrane contactors ion exchange or photosynthetic bioreactors most of these systems require solid and sulfide free influents with low organic contents so that modeling effluent quality in terms of vfa and other organics or sulfide is needed to evaluate the technical economic and environmental feasibility of combining anmbr with selected post treatments since a single optimal technological solution for the whole range of situations has yet to be proposed modeling nutrient sulfide and dissolved methane effluent quality would help to evaluate not only the technical feasibility of the solution but also different environmental impact indexes such as prevention of eutrophication in aquatic environments reduction of the environmental impact of phosphate mining or reducing the energy demand for chemical fertilizer production plant wide modeling would also assist in the selection of optimized layouts for resource recovery and removal such as combining anmbr with an as based post treatment for nutrient removal or anmbr with classical and emerging technologies for nutrient recovery see e g robles et al 2020 4 conclusions the extended bnrm2s model successfully reproduced the performance of an anmbr pilot plant that treated sulfate rich uww under different conditions despite the operating dynamics srt hrt and t and influent composition the model was able to reproduce the process performance and successfully captured influent loading rate dynamics and effluent quality which is essential for designing classical or advanced nutrient removal or recovery techniques high sulfate and low sulfide effluent concentrations were also reproduced at lower influent bod so4 2 s ratios in this respect modeling the competition between srb and methanogens which affect methane production facilitates the design and selection of suitable approaches for dissolved methane capture or removal the proposed model can thus be used for different purposes designing and upgrading anmbr and other anaerobic systems evaluating process

17697,although anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbr are a core technology in the transition of urban wastewater uww treatment towards a circular economy the transition is being held back by a number of bottlenecks the dissolved methane released from the effluent the need to remove nutrients ideally by recovery or the energy lost by the competition between methanogenic and sulfate reducing bacteria srb for the biodegradable cod have been identified as the main issues to be addressed before anmbr becomes widespread mathematical modeling of this technology can be used to obtain further insights into these bottlenecks plus other valuable information for design simulation and control purposes this paper therefore proposes an anmbr anaerobic digestion model to simulate the crucial srb related process since these bacteria degrade more than 40 of the organic matter the proposed model which is included in the bnrm2 collection model has a reduced but all inclusive structure including hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis methanogenesis and other srb related processes it was calibrated and validated using data from an anmbr pilot plant treating sulfate rich uww including parameter values obtained in off line experiments and optimization methods despite the complex operating dynamics and influent composition it was able to reproduce the process performance in fact it was able to simulate the ad of sulfate rich uww considering only two groups of srb heterotrophic srb growing on both vfa propionate and acetate and autotrophic srb growing on hydrogen besides the above mentioned constraints the model reproduced the dynamics of the mixed liquor solids concentration which helped to integrate biochemical and filtration models it also reproduced the alkalinity and ph dynamics in the mixed liquor required for assessing the effect of chemical precipitation on membrane scaling keywords anaerobic membrane bioreactor bnrm2 modeling sulfate rich urban wastewater 1 introduction anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbr have attracted attention to drive the shift of urban wastewater uww treatment towards the circular economy this technology combines the advantages of anaerobic systems with membrane filtration i it retains 100 of particulate materials allowing accurate control of the sludge retention time srt thus preventing slow growing methane forming methanogens to be washed out of the system while producing high quality solids and pathogen free effluent ii it enables ad to be operated at ambient temperatures by increasing the srt iii it reduces biosolid waste because of the lower biomass yields of anaerobic microorganisms and iv it transforms organics into a gaseous energy carrier ch4 lei et al 2018 maaz et al 2019 robles et al 2018a shin and bae 2018 anmbr does not destroy nutrients and produces a nutrient loaded high quality effluent useful for nutrient recovery e g struvite crystallization microalgae cultivation and fertirrigation among others chen 2020 guo et al 2016 raskin et al 2012 indeed optimizing anmbr design and operations by the assessment of environmental economic and technological trade offs enables ad to be operated cost effectively with a significant reduction in costs and environmental impact while being a net energy producer unlike conventional aerobic uww treatments combined with waste sludge ad mei et al 2016 pretel et al 2016 however this application still presents some issues that need further consideration such as i the methane concentration dissolved in the effluent which has to be captured to maximize energy harvesting and avoid direct greenhouse gas ghg emissions downstream cookney et al 2016 crone et al 2016 sanchis perucho et al 2020 ii the need for a post treatment step for nutrient recovery within the circular economy robles et al 2020 ye et al 2020 or iii the reduced energy harvested due to the competition between methanogens and sulfate reducing bacteria srb for the available substrate when treating uww with low biodegradable organics to sulfate ratios bod so42 s see e g gimÃ©nez et al 2012b lens et al 1998a pretel et al 2014 although anmbr has been put forward as a core technology for the sustainable treatment of different waste streams it is necessary to thoroughly explore the role and impact of its drawbacks before its widespread application anmbr modeling can offer a number of advantages in this field including the analysis of technical economic and environmental feasibility technology development or model based design since it has not yet been implemented full scale for uww treatment the design issues are particularly important as they finally determine capital costs operating costs and technical viability anaerobic digestion ad modeling is a mature field largely guided by mechanistic model structures defined by understanding the underlying processes batstone et al 2015 the most widely used ad model to describe sludge stabilization is the well known iwa adm1 batstone et al 2002 which has been applied to modeling a large number of ad processes donoso bravo et al 2011 however the model calibration and validation can be somewhat complex for modeling certain substrates the modeling goal should define the complexity level of the model to be selected in order to obtain useful information donoso bravo et al 2011 e g understanding metabolic pathways evaluating effluent quality assessing biogas production and quality evaluating membrane fouling etc for instance simulating methane production or effluent quality in a system treating low strength wastewater such as uww may require less data on the metabolic pathways for organic degradation than the treatment of high strength wastewaters while the degradation of more complex substrates e g food waste could require expanded existing models one issue of ad modeling deals with selecting and adapting models capable of reproducing the performance of new anaerobic processes such as anmbr robles et al 2018b the model parameters should be optimized specifically for anmbr technology since membrane filtration can control srt while modifying the organic loading rate olr thus affecting the limiting or controlling mechanisms during ad data from an existing anmbr system would allow specific parameters to be tuned also well balanced model complexity and usability is essential for anmbrs e g one of the key issues is the type of particle treated i e biomass and solid substrate since it affects membrane performance the kinetic structure of the biological model should be relatively simple at least two step but complex enough to represent the behavior of the particles in the system batstone 2006 different modifications are available for adapting adm1 to different processes batstone et al 2006 2015 zaher et al 2007 kythreotou et al 2014 several authors have proposed simpler modeling approaches e g charfi et al 2017 developed a mathematical model for anmbr simulation coupling a simplified anaerobic model and another for membrane fouling the bnrm2 collection model proposed by barat et al 2013 incorporates a simplification of adm1 in a general model linked to a an anmbr filtration model robles et al 2013b although sulfate reducing processes are not incorporated in barat et al 2013 bnrm2 considers the most important physical chemical and biological processes taking place in wwtps the physical processes considered are sedimentation and gas liquid transfer and the chemical are acid base reactions considered as equilibrium governed processes and precipitation and redissolution processes the bacterial groups considered are heterotrophic two groups of ammonium oxidizing k strategist and r strategist nitrite oxidizing polyphosphate accumulating acidogenic acetogenic and two groups of methanogenic acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic copp et al 2005 presented an ad sub model model extracted from the mantis collection model on gps x software which also includes an anmbr module aquino and stuckey 2008 incorporated soluble microbial products smps and extracellular polymeric substances epss in a reduced model architecture due to the accumulation of smps inside ad systems and their effect on other downstream processes such as membrane filtration the am2b anaerobic model proposed by benyahia et al 2013 a modification of the simple two step am2 model bernard et al 2001 incorporates smp production and degradation pathways to allow integration with a filtration sub model however anaerobic models applied to anmbrs are usually developed or validated for the treatment of high strength wastewater modeling the amount of methane dissolved in the effluent is essential to evaluate and optimize the economic and environmental feasibility of ad systems for sewage treatment especially when operating at low temperatures since the amount of methane that is lost in the effluent can increase by up to 80 when operating at temperatures below 15 c gimÃ©nez et al 2014 a post treatment step for nutrient removal and or recovery might be needed depending on the sensitivity of the receiving water body accurately determining effluent quality is thus essential for designing classical or advanced techniques for nutrient removal or recovery such as an ammox process membrane contactors bioelectrochemical systems microalgae cultivation phototrophic bacteria cultivation fertirrigation ion exchange ammonia stripping etc robles et al 2020 modeling sulfate reduction in ad systems is also essential to assess uww methane production with low biodegradable organics to sulfate ratios bod so4 2 s where competition between methanotrophs and srb may be a key phenomenon the most popular anaerobic models dealing with srb are usually complex and the information contained in parameter values and model structure does not translate well to simple design rules batstone 2006 other authors have modelled these processes at lower complexity levels by proposing different numbers of srb activities and electron donors cassidy et al 2015 as commented before selecting complexity levels depends on the modeling goal e g understanding metabolic pathways or evaluating biogas production and quality for instance different models with a limited number of srb pathways have been proposed to simulate the competition between methanogens and srb for acetate fomichev and vavilin 1997 acetate and hydrogen ahammad et al 2011 harerimana et al 2013 or simply hydrogen batstone 2006 increasing the number of srb pathways knobel and lewis 2002 considered five groups of srb consuming butyrate lactate propionate acetate and hydrogen frunzo et al 2012 also considered five groups of microbes heterotrophic srb autotrophic srb homoacetogenic bacteria methanogenic archaea and acetate degrading bacteria and kalyuzhnyi and fedorovich 1998 proposed seven srb groups up to four srb groups consuming butyrate propionate acetate and hydrogen were incorporated in the adm1 by ahmed and rodrÃ­guez 2018 2017 barrera et al 2015 fedorovich et al 2003 and most of these models were developed and validated in ad systems treating high strength wastewaters due to the low bod so4 2 s srb modeling is essential for mainstream ad technology development although fedorovich et al 2003 and other authors have presented useful extensions to the adm1 for sulfate reduction these extensions usually include several processes that complicate model implementation and usability apart from having been developed for high strength wastewater indeed the simplification proposed by batstone et al 2002 aims to avoid these complexities by assessing sulfate reduction and only considering the oxidation of available hydrogen by adding hydrogen and bicarbonate as separate states this simplified approach was validated at so4 2 s bod ratios of up to approximately 0 1 gs g 1cod after which hydrogen is depleted at higher so4 2 s bod ratios srb starts to oxidize organic acids and other metabolic pathways are needed thus a compromise between complexity and usability is needed for modeling mainstream ad systems treating wastewaters characterized by low bod so4 2 s ratios such as sulfate rich uww it is also necessary to adequately reproduce physicochemical dynamics e g gas flow chemical equilibrium and ph calculation in order to account for other processes affecting anmbr such as chemical precipitation and membrane scaling in contrast to other ad systems gas assisted anmbr systems are usually operated under gas saturation so that gas flow calculations are essential to evaluate the dissolved gas content in the effluent dissolved methane should be recovered in downstream processes to enhance the viability of full scale anmbr for uww treatment apart from biogas production adequate representation of saturation and oversaturation of liquid streams is essential in mainstream ad processes ph has a strong impact on carbon dioxide transfer mineral solids precipitation and biological conversions the concentrations of ionic species acids and bases in equilibrium with ionic active state variables can also be calculated from this equilibrium precipitation calculations are possible which is essential to evaluate problems related to membrane scaling or the potential nutrient recovery from the effluent in downstream processes therefore comprehensive ph and equilibrium prediction is needed to evaluate the feasibility of different treatment platforms for resource recovery deepening the understanding of the mechanistic processes involved could also expand anmbr applicability to address new challenges such as combining anmbr with other technologies for the recovery of resources and it is expected to be combined with new or existing technologies for uww treatment e g primary settling activated sludge processes for nutrient removal etc the integration of anmbr anaerobic models into plant wide or collection models would help to develop new resource recovery platforms which would assist in selecting the best treatment scheme and optimal operational conditions by considering a variety of technological solutions for resource recovery and nutrients removal seco et al 2020 for example solon et al 2019 evaluated the effects on plant performance of combining techniques to recover resources from wastewater other examples are available setting down the rules to assist in the conception and design of new schemes fernÃ¡ndez arÃ©valo et al 2017 lizarralde et al 2019 martÃ­ et al 2017 different studies are also available comparing this technology with conventional technologies for instance pretel et al 2016 contrasted the performance of an anmbr combined with a nutrient removal post treatment with different aerobic based wastewater treatment schemes using a plant wide model becker et al 2017 put forward anmbr and high rate activated sludge hras combined with ad for the co digestion of domestic wastewater and food waste last but not least adequate resource recovery modeling platforms would help model based control development of non linear processes making it possible to develop and test new control and optimization strategies although bnrm2 is a collection model it fails to simulate the anmbr performance when treating sulfate rich uww in this case the model overestimates methane production since the srb are not considered in this context this paper proposes the bnrm2s a modified version of the bnrm2 plant wide model barat et al 2013 which can be applied to different anaerobic systems for sulfate rich uww treatment such as anmbr bnrm2 has a reduced comprehensive structure for the anaerobic degradation of organics including hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis methanogenesis and the effect of influent sulfate on process performance the model is implemented on desass software ferrer et al 2008 and was calibrated and validated by data from an anmbr plant with industrial scale membranes the paper also gives an overview of current and future challenges in anmbr modeling 2 material and methods 2 1 anmbr pilot plant the proposed model was calibrated and validated by data from an anmbr pilot plant at the barranco del carraixet wwtp in alboraya valencia spain the anmbr consisted of a 1 3 m3 jacketed anaerobic reactor connected to two 0 8 m3 membrane tanks each membrane tank included one commercial ultrafiltration hollow fiber membrane system kms pur psh31 0 03 Î¼m pores 31 m2 filtration area a rotofilter with a screen size of 0 5 mm was installed as pre treatment one equalization tank 0 3 m3 and one clean in place tank 0 2 m3 were also included as main elements of the pilot plant a fraction of the produced biogas was continuously recycled to the anaerobic reactor in order to improve the stirring conditions and to favor stripping the produced gases from the liquid phase while another fraction was continuously recycled to the bottom of the hollow fiber membranes to minimize cake layer formation a degassing vessel was installed between each membrane tank and its vacuum pump to recover bubbles of biogas in the permeate a temperature control system was implemented consisting of a warm water tank equipped with a 6 kw heater and a thermostat that maintained the water at 65 c when necessary the temperature in the anaerobic reactor was controlled by a water pump that enabled the warm water to flow through the reactor jacket according to the difference between the reactor and set point temperatures further details of this anmbr pilot plant can be found in gimÃ©nez et al 2011 2 2 anmbr pilot plant monitoring different on line sensors and monitoring equipment were installed in the plant to obtain real time information on the state of the process such as gas flow rate transmitters vortex type in the gas inlets to anaerobic reactor and membrane tanks one gas pressure transmitter gauge pressure type which monitored the gas pressure in the head of the reactor one ph t and one orp sensor in the anaerobic reactor internal sludge recycling one biogas analyzer to monitor biogas composition ch4 co2 h2 and h2s and one gas meter pulse measurement to monitor biogas production besides the on line process monitoring the following parameters were determined to monitor plant performance total and soluble

according to standard methods apha 2005 nt was determined with commercial total nitrogen cell tests 114537 merck millipore vfa and alk concentration was determined by titration according to the method proposed by moosbrugger et al 1992 the concentration of dissolved methane in the effluent was indirectly determined through the static headspace gas chromatography analysis technique described by gimÃ©nez et al 2012b biogas composition was monitored with an emmerson process analytical gmbh x stream multiple purpose multiparametric gas analyzer after sample conditioning non dispersive infrared and ultraviolet and termoconductivity analyzers were used for ch4 and co2 h2 and h2s respectively 2 4 anmbr plant operation the plant was continuously operated for 2 5 years with effluent from the pre treatment of the carraixet full scale wwtp valÃ¨ncia spain the pre treatment step of the full scale facility consisted of screening and sand and grease removal after an additional pre treatment of the wastewater in a sieve screw and homogenization in an equalization tank the wastewater was pumped to the anaerobic reactor the average characterization of the influent during the experimental period is shown in table 1 the influent wastewater was characterized by a notably low bod so4 2 s ratio mean 3 6 1 97 kg bod kg 1 so4 s as well as a highly variable load which enabled calibrating and validating model performance under a wide range of influent conditions fig 1 shows the evolution during the experimental period of the srt the hydraulic retention time hrt and the temperature as this figure shows the entire experimental period was divided into 13 operating periods periods i to xiii in which the operating conditions were srt 20 70 days olr 0 5 2 kg cod m3 d 1 and hrt 5 24 h temperature ranged from 14 to 33 c the anmbr was firstly operated at a controlled temperature of 33 and 20 c days 1 150 and 200 400 respectively while the system was mostly operated at ambient temperature the temperature controller was switched off from day 400 to the end of the experimental period see fig 1 an in depth analysis of the experimental data used in this study can be found in gimÃ©nez et al 2014 2012a 2012b 2011 the mixed liquor from the anaerobic reactor was continuously recycled through the membrane tanks in which the effluent was obtained by vacuum filtration a fraction of the biogas produced in the system was recycled to the reactor for stirring purposes through fine bubble diffusers biogas recycling flow to the reactor was around 0 5 nm3 per m3 of working volume another fraction was recycled to the membrane tanks for membrane scouring for its additional gas stripping effect the specific gas demand per membrane area was around 0 2 0 3 nm3 h per m2 of membrane further details on membrane performance can be found elsewhere see e g robles et al 2014 this stirring strategy favored the mass transfer of dissolved gases between the liquid and gas phases thus avoiding oversaturation of methane in the effluent gimÃ©nez et al 2012b 2 5 model description this paper describes an extended version of the ad sub model included in the bnrm2 collection model barat et al 2013 including srb related processes the ad sub model has a reduced but comprehensive structure based on hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis all the model components and model notations are defined following the standard nomenclature proposed by corominas et al 2010 the soluble components considered in the ad sub model are the following fermentable readily biodegradable substrate not including vfa sf fermentation products expressed as propionate excluding acetate svfa acetate sac dissolved hydrogen sh2 dissolved methane sch4 total inorganic carbon consisting of co2 hco3 and co3 2 sig c inert soluble organic material su total proton concentration including free protons and those associated with acidic components sh ammonium plus ammonia nitrogen snhx and orthophosphates spo4 minteqa2 is used to calculate the equilibrium which includes the calculation of ionic species the particulate components considered are the following inert particulate organic material xu particulate biodegradable organic material xcb acidogenic bacteria xao acetogenic bacteria xpro methanogenic acetoclastic organisms xaco methanogenic hydrogenotrophic organisms xhmo and total suspended solids xtss due to the reduced complexity of the substrate to be consumed sulfate rich uww only two groups of srb were considered heterotrophic srb growing on both vfa propionate and acetate and autotrophic srb growing on hydrogen as regards sulfate reducing processes the extended bnrm2s model considers 4 new components split into 2 soluble and 2 particulates sulfate sso4 total sulfide ss heterotrophic srb xhsro and autotrophic srb xasro only one group of heterotrophic srb was considered since it was demonstrated in batch experiments data not shown that the srb that degrade both substrates should be considered as the same bacterial group srb that degrade fermentable readily biodegradable substrates sf were not considered since acidogenic bacteria outcompete this bacterial group widdel 1988 only two groups of srb were therefore introduced in the model heterotrophic srb are able to grow on acetate and propionate the catabolic reactions are shown in eqs 1 and 2

this species was included in the kinetic expression of every growth process fig 2 shows a schematic representation of the biochemical processes included in the ad model extracted from the bnrm2s collection model including sulfate reducing processes the stoichiometry of the anaerobic sub model included in bnrm2s and the conversion factors to be applied to the continuity equations of the model for n p mass carbon and proton are available as e supplementary material table s1 and table s2 the kinetic expressions of the anaerobic sub model in bnrm2s are also provided as e supplementary material table s3 a surface limited reaction was assumed for the kinetic expressions of the hydrolysis process as usually considered in activated sludge models monod terms are used to model the growth limitation for substrate electron acceptor and nutrients non competitive inhibition terms were used to model thermodynamic inhibitions high hydrogen concentrations reduce the fermentation rate as well as the microbial inhibitions growth rate of all the bacterial groups are affected by the presence of hydrogen sulfide since it is assumed that svfa and sa are consumed simultaneously by srb competitive inhibition terms were included in the corresponding kinetic expressions the ph inhibition function denoted by iph1 consists of a combination of classical monod and non competitive

make it necessary to calculate the chemical equilibrium to obtain the concentration of given inorganic soluble components under its different species co2 h2s nh3 for this acid base and ion pairing reactions are included in the model as equilibrium governed processes this equilibrium is described by a set of non linear algebraic equations including one law of mass action for each specie formed in each equilibrium system eq 4 and one mass balance for each component eq 5 instead of using the charge balance for ph calculations the model considers a mass balance for the proton component i e total proton is a model component the software minteqa2 allison et al 1991 was used for equilibrium and ph calculations the mathematical formulation of minteqa2 can be summarized as follows see minteqa2 user s manual version 4 03 a system of n independent components that can be combined to form m species is represented by a set of mass action expressions in the form of eq 4 x i k i j 1 n c x j a i j i 1 2 n s p where x i is the activity of the ith specie x j is the activity of the jth specie a ij is the stoichiometric coefficient of the jth component in the ith specie see e supplementary material table s4 k i is the stability constant of the ith specie corrected for temperature variations with van t hoff equation n sp is the number of species considered and n c is the number of components in addition to the mass action expression the set of n independent components can be represented by n mass balance equations in the form of eq 5 t j i 1 n s p a i j c i j 1 2 n c where t j is the total concentration of component j calculated in the kinetic model and c i is the concentration of the ith specie equilibrium conditions are assumed the activity and concentration of every

procedure see serralta et al 2004 the bnrm2 collection model including srb related processes was implemented on desass software ferrer et al 2008 which allows the user two possibilities for srt control i to establish the srt or ii to establish the sludge waste flow rate in the first case used for steady state simulations the software calculates the sludge waste flow rate required to maintain a selected srt taking into account the suspended solids concentration in the second case for dynamic simulations the software calculates the srt value the software can also set the retention capacity of the membrane to simulate different filtration technologies e g microfiltration and ultrafiltration in this work ultrafiltration was used thus complete retention of particulate compounds was considered the model can be linked to a previously developed filtration model applied to anmbr technology robles et al 2013b through the state variable xtss 2 6 model calibration the anmbr plant was continuously run under different operating conditions for 2 5 years to provide model development calibration and validation on line calibration was carried out using the pseudo steady state conditions reached at the end of periods ix and xii the parameters calibrated by this method were maximum growth rates decay rates temperature coefficients half saturation constants for substrate and electron acceptor biomass yields and parameters related to the hydrolysis process half saturation constants for nutrients and inhibition constants were obtained from the literature the main drawback of on line calibration is that system dynamics can be reproduced by different sets of parameter values so that off line lab experiments were also conducted to calibrate the main heterotrophic srb parameters by isolating specific heterotrophic srb related processes mainly based on sulfate reduction rate srr measurements these experiments provided information on the maximum srb activity under certain conditions including biomass concentration substrate and inhibitor concentrations and operating temperature different experiments were carried out at different temperatures using different initial substrate and sulfate concentrations to determine the yield of heterotrophic srb the sulfate half saturation constant and the acetate and propionate half saturation constants the temperature was controlled by a thermostated water bath during these experiments the time evolution of sulfate and vfa concentrations was measured since sulfide is oxidized to sulfate during the analytical procedure sulfide was precipitated to obtain accurate sulfate concentration measurements the constrained rosenbrock optimization method was applied to obtain the parameter values that were dynamically determined on line calibration the anmbr plant was simulated in an iterative process aimed at minimizing the sum of square relative errors the variables used for the optimization were soluble and total cod sulfate and sulfide effluent concentrations total and volatile suspended solids in the anmbr alkalinity biogas flow rate and biogas composition ch4 the simulations started with initial model parameter values from the literature and were modified in successive simulations according to the results obtained within the previously established range and stopped when the set precision was reached the tolerance criterion was set to 0 001 for each variable and the maximum number of iterations was set to 1500 for the optimization method the model parameter values obtained were used for validating the model under steady state and dynamic conditions the mass transfer coefficient for dissolved methane a c h 4 was obtained by establishing the dissolved methane concentration as the 102 of the saturation concentration when used to minimize membrane fouling gas sparging avoids methane supersaturation according to merkel and krauth 1999 the mass transfer coefficient for the rest of the gaseous species can be calculated from the methane coefficient using eq 6 eq 8 k l a c h 4 d i d c h 4 where kla i is the mass transfer coefficient of the gas i d 1 di is the diffusivity of the gas i 2 7 model validation five operating periods were selected for model validation under dynamic conditions periods ii vi ix x and xii covering a wide range of the main operational parameters srt varied between 20 and 70 days temperature between 20 and 33 c and hrt between 12 and 30 h the pseudo steady state conditions reached at the end of these periods were used to validate the steady state model these periods were simulated to verify that both the model and the calibrated parameters were able to reproduce the plant behavior in operating conditions other than those used for mathematical fitting 3 results and discussion 3 1 parameter calibration table 2 collects the stoichiometric and kinetic parameters resulting from the model calibration it should be noted that the parameters related to srb obtained a higher value for biomass yield than that obtained for the other bacterial groups also the significant difference between the half saturation constant for acetate 5 12 mg cod l 1 and propionate 29 4 mg cod l 1 the high biomass yield was due to the external electron acceptor used by srb which leads srb to outcompete methanogenic bacteria the low propionate concentrations usually present in the anmbr systems lead to acetogenic bacteria outcompeting heterotrophic srb because of the significant difference between half saturation constants for both bacterial groups 2 2 mg cod l 1 for xpro and 29 4 mg cod l 1 for xasro 3 2 steady state model performance table 3 shows the results of the simulation of the pseudo steady state conditions reached at the end of periods vi ix x and xii the comparison of the modelled and experimental data for the main characteristics of permeate waste sludge and biogas showed that the model was able to reproduce the anmbr performance in different steady state conditions 3 3 dynamic model performance to validate the model behavior in dynamic conditions five operating periods conducted at different srts 70 40 30 40 and 20 days were simulated periods ii vi ix x and xii respectively in these periods the main operational parameters were modified srt from 70 d to 40 d in period vi and from 30 d to 40 d in period x temperature from 15 c to 20 c in period ix and from 20 c to 30 c in period xi and hrt from 17 h to 11 h in period ii and from 15 h to 40h in period xi figs 3 5 show the experimental results obtained in the anmbr plant dashed lines compared to the model predictions continuous lines additional periods are provided as e supplementary material fig s1 and fig s2 fig 3 shows the simulation results for period ii during this period operating temperature and srt remained virtually constant while the hrt was gradually reduced from 17 to 11 h as fig 3a shows ts and vs increased in the mixed liquor due to the reduced hrt from day 70 80 approx there were peaks in olr see cod so4 2 s ratio in fig 3g which were reflected in the accumulation of vfa and ammonium see fig 3c and d respectively fig 3g also shows that the organic peak loads promoted the growth of both acidogenic xao and acetogenic xpro organisms the increased fermentation produced more hydrogen which was completely consumed by the autotrophic srb xasro as shown by the absence of hydrogenotrophic methanogens xhmo these results are in agreement with the expected trend since xasro gain more energy from hydrogen consumption and have higher substrate affinity maximum growth rate and biomass yield than xhmo see table 2 conversely organic peak loads resulted in a decrease of heterotrophic srb xhsro concentration since more sulfate was consumed by xasro the higher availability of acetate derived from the cod so4 2 s peaks and the reduced xhsro thus increased acetoclastic methanogen xamo concentration fig 4 gives the simulation results for period vi at the beginning of this period srt was reduced from 70 to 40 days mixed liquor vs and ts gradually dropped due to the increase in the waste sludge associated with the lower srt see fig 3a the lower srt and organic loading rate hrt was increased from 24 h to 34 h led to a reduced concentration of most of the bacterial groups srb being one of the most affected heterotrophics see fig 4g it is important to note the behavior between days 470 and 490 when high sulfate and low sulfide effluent concentrations were observed see fig 4e as a consequence of the low influent organic load which restricted sulfate reducing processes the sulfide produced was distributed among its different species depending on the ph according to lens et al 1998 only the first dissociation equilibrium of h2s is of important at neutral ph so that most of the sulfide produced was present either as the undissociated form h2s or the ionic species hs the concentration of s2 being negligible the undissociated form is presumably responsible for the inhibitory effect of sulfide since only uncharged molecules can permeate the cell membrane maree and strydom 1985 for instance for the operating temperature of period vi the pka of the first dissociation equilibrium of h2s is around 6 9 lens et al 1998 indicating that only the undissociated form h2s and the ionic species hs concentrations were significant specifically the anmbr ph during this period was around 6 9 resulting in h2s concentrations around 80 of the total sulfide produced fedorovich et al 2003 reported 50 inhibitory values of h2s k i h2s for several microbial groups considering first order inhibition kinetics see table 2 the most sensitive groups to h2s inhibition were hydrogenotrophic and acetotrophic methanogens xhmoand xaco respectively whose activity was half inhibited at h2s concentrations of 213 and 245 mg h2s s l 1 sulfate reducer activity was half inhibited at h2s concentrations of 265 mg h2s s l 1 sro and methanogenic activity was thus slightly inhibited during the experimental period fig 5 shows the simulation results for period x during which srt was raised from 30 to 40 days while ambient temperature remained around 20 c which increased solids concentration in the mixed liquor see fig 5a sulfate was not completely consumed by the srb at the beginning of period x see fig 5e during this period sulfate concentration rose to 139 mg so4 2 s l 1 while the average influent value was 108 mg so4 2 s l 1 the extra sulfate load in the system intensified the competition between srb and methanogens for the available substrates as a result of the reduced cod so4 2 s ratio initially the existing srb population was not able to completely consume the available sulfate however they gradually outcompeted the methanogens as shown by the shrinking biogas production and the rising xasro see fig 5b and g respectively this increase in influent sulfate concentration affected methane production and the influent flow was doubled between days 675 and 685 thus affecting both the loading rate entering the system and the extraction of compounds such as dissolved methane due to a significant decrease in the hrt the higher cod so4 2 s ratio between days 674 and 694 promoted the growth of xao xpro xasro and reduced the concentration of xhsro as in period ii the availability of acetate stimulated the growth of xaco sub plot g in figs 3 5 shows the population dynamics predicted by the model autotrophic sulfate reducers xasro outcompeted hydrogenotrophic methanogens xhmo since according to process fundamentals xasro gain more energy from hydrogen consumption and have higher substrate affinity growth rate and cell yield than xhmo lens et al 1998 indeed xhmo concentration was negligible during the whole experimental period and the electrons from the hydrogen produced were derived to sulfide rather than to methane proportionally reducing the uww methane potential sulfate was consumed preferentially by xasro as long as hydrogen and sulfate were present this is in agreement with the findings by laanbroek et al 1984 who reported autotrophic srb desulfovibrio spp having a higher affinity for the substrates than other heterotrophic srb desulfobulbus spp and desulfobacter spp under sulfate limited environments this is the reason why the concentration of heterotrophic sulfate reducers xhsro was inversely affected by the organic loading rate which enhanced hydrogen production via fermentation xhsro can metabolize a wide range of substrates and competed for the common substrates with acetogens xpro and acetoclastic methanogens xaco as long as sulfate was left from the autotrophic sulfate reduction the concentration of xpro remained virtually steady during each period indicating that xpro successfully competed with xhsro conversely in spite of the residual acetate derived methane production a decreasing trend was detected for xaco when sulfate was not limited low organic load episodes during summer periods vi and xii in any case xhsro were sulfate limited most of the time and it was completely reduced as long as the bod so4 2 s ratio was above the stoichiometric threshold 2 g bod g 1 s under sulfate limited conditions acetate electrons were also derived towards sulfide rather than to methane reducing the uww methane potential a lower methane potential entails a loss of energy efficiency for the system since less energy can be recovered either as power or heat 3 4 overall model performance the results of the model validation for all the variables evaluated throughout all the operating periods gave an overall r2 coefficient of 0 9966 see e supplementary material fig s3 which represents a scatter plot of the simulated values versus the experimental data the graph includes more than 1000 pairs of data showing the reproducibility of the model and the parameters fitted from experimental data collected from the pilot plant besides the operating dynamics srt hrt and t and influent characterization the model was able to accurately reproduce the process performance it should be noted that the model reproduced the solids concentration dynamics in the mixed liquor which is essential in anmbrs due to the need to integrate both biochemical and filtration models the ad sub model was coupled to a filtration model through the mixed liquor ts concentration also developed calibrated and validated with the data from the anmbr plant further details of the filtration model and the integration with the biochemical model can be found in robles et al 2014 2013b 2013a the model also faithfully reproduced the dynamics of both alkalinity and ph in the mixed liquor besides chemical precipitation also affecting membrane scaling alkalinity and ph affect species equilibrium and gas liquid transfer processes in this respect it is vital to minimize oversaturation of dissolved gases in the liquid phase which can be achieved by adequate reactor stirring optimization as ph also plays a key role in the equilibrium of other dissolved gases e g nh3 h2s between liquid and gas phases thus affecting the quality of the biogas produced accurate modeling of dissolved gas concentration and ph is needed to evaluate and optimize anmbr feasibility for uww treatment at ambient temperatures the simulation data satisfactorily represented experimental data related to srb processes which have a significant impact on the performance of the anmbr fed with sulfate rich uww results from other compounds such as vfa and methane production also accurately reproduced the interactions between srb and methanogens with a lower complexity level than other available models it was also able to capture the reduced biogas production from srb methanogens competition during low cod so4 2 s ratio events see fig 5b the model s population shift predictions showed that acidogenic bacteria concentrations were mainly dependent on the system s organic loading rate whose trend was accurately described by the cod so4 2 s ratio and the temperature which strongly affects the hydrolysis rate since hydrogen was mainly produced during fermentation the concentration of autotrophic srb followed the same trend the higher the concentration of xasro the higher the sulfate reduced autotrophically and the lower the xhsro concentration all the methane production was due to acetoclastic methanogens since hydrogenotropic methanogens were outcompeted by autrotropihc srb it should be noted that the model could require a widened structure depending for instance on the substrate degradation complexity or the objective of the modeling task in this respect ahmed and rodrÃ­guez 2018 also stated that complex model structures are only recommended for specific experimental cases these authors evaluated the complexity of five adm1 based model structures differing in the number of srb groups considered and based on the electron donors used their objective was to evaluate the accuracy of each modeling approach for different aims thus helping developers and users to decide on the appropriate degree of complexity required the results found that it is possible to simulate the ad of cane molasses with high cod and high sulfate feed even when only acetate utilizing and hydrogen utilizing srb are considered achieving a good performance complexity balance in terms of prediction errors against experimental data determining the biological complexity for the modeling goal particularly the inclusion of alternative electron sinks is thus a key issue while a benchmark modeling framework including standardized calibration protocols could be needed to deal with possible microbial ecology shifts affecting model accuracy 3 5 implications for anmbr implementation as already mentioned modeling sulfate reducing processes is a vital part of evaluating the feasibility of anmbr for uww treatment because of different factors modeling the amount of methane produced facilitates the design and selection of suitable approaches for dissolved methane capture or removal for the former degasification by non porous membranes and micro porous membrane contactors are promising technologies for dissolved methane recovery some authors have reported net energy recoveries when capturing the methane dissolved in anmbr effluents through membrane processes cookney et al 2016 henares et al 2017 while others obtained high nitrogen removal rates when using dissolved methane as the electron donor for denitrification in a post treatment process sÃ¡nchez ramÃ­rez et al 2015 pelaz et al 2018 concerning corrosion issues anmbr biogas contains variable amounts of h2s which can affect all biogas conversions and equipment the h2s concentration in the biogas was much higher than in conventional ad likely due to the much lower cod so4 2 s ratio in the uww than in other ad substrates e g sewage sludge the h2s content in the anmbr biogas ranged from around 10000 to 25000 ppm which were adequately reproduced by the model as the quality requirements depend on the use the biogas is to be put to acid biogas sweetening could be required according to the h2s tolerance of the chp technology used before it can be energetically valorized since h2s is transformed into highly corrosive sulfuric acid on combustion a post treatment step could be required for effluent nutrient removal or recovery depending on the characteristics of the receiving water body it could also be necessary to remove sulfide since it can be detrimental to downstream processes sulfide contributes to the effluent cod which has discharge limits in most countries last but not least recovery of dissolved methane which is an energy carrier with high global warming potential could help to reduce ghg emissions while enhancing the system s energy recovery potential which means it is essential to accurately reproduce effluent quality for designing classical or advanced techniques for nutrient sulfide or dissolved methane removal or recovery for instance the high quality nutrient loaded permeate produced makes it suitable for fertigation nevertheless when fertigation is limited by regulations a combination of anmbr with a nutrient recovery post treatment method can be used e g membrane contactors ion exchange or photosynthetic bioreactors most of these systems require solid and sulfide free influents with low organic contents so that modeling effluent quality in terms of vfa and other organics or sulfide is needed to evaluate the technical economic and environmental feasibility of combining anmbr with selected post treatments since a single optimal technological solution for the whole range of situations has yet to be proposed modeling nutrient sulfide and dissolved methane effluent quality would help to evaluate not only the technical feasibility of the solution but also different environmental impact indexes such as prevention of eutrophication in aquatic environments reduction of the environmental impact of phosphate mining or reducing the energy demand for chemical fertilizer production plant wide modeling would also assist in the selection of optimized layouts for resource recovery and removal such as combining anmbr with an as based post treatment for nutrient removal or anmbr with classical and emerging technologies for nutrient recovery see e g robles et al 2020 4 conclusions the extended bnrm2s model successfully reproduced the performance of an anmbr pilot plant that treated sulfate rich uww under different conditions despite the operating dynamics srt hrt and t and influent composition the model was able to reproduce the process performance and successfully captured influent loading rate dynamics and effluent quality which is essential for designing classical or advanced nutrient removal or recovery techniques high sulfate and low sulfide effluent concentrations were also reproduced at lower influent bod so4 2 s ratios in this respect modeling the competition between srb and methanogens which affect methane production facilitates the design and selection of suitable approaches for dissolved methane capture or removal the proposed model can thus be used for different purposes designing and upgrading anmbr and other anaerobic systems evaluating process

17698,chemical disinfection of municipal wastewater to preserve the microbiological quality of discharges has traditionally relied on chlorine and more recently on peracetic acid paa a more recent option is performic acid pfa this work uses laboratory and full scale studies over a span of 15 years and five wastewater treatment plants wwtps in italy to compare the efficacy of these three disinfectants and identify the differences among peracids in a context where both can be an alternative to chlorine the investigations focused on treatment effectiveness and bacterial inactivation kinetics using e coli and the more resistant enterococci as well as on pfa and paa decomposition as the residuals may affect the downstream microenvironment furthermore the potential for the two peracids to oxidize organic substances and create troublesome byproducts was also studied chlorine applied as hypochlorite hyp and here essentially functioning as chloramines was used as a baseline comparison for the two peracids appropriate statistical tests were applied to the data from different wwtps to account for potential interferences and compounding effects of the different matrices average doses of 0 8 2 9 and 1 4 mg l and contact times of 18 21 and 31 min respectively for pfa chlorine and paa guaranteed with a high level of assurance the 5000 cfu 100 ml e coli limit the order of effectiveness was pfa hyp paa refined as pfa hyp paa against e coli and pfa hyp paa with enterococci similar bacterial reductions for the peracids were found at higher disinfectant doses used for the kinetic tests pfa decayed more quickly than paa the first order decay constants were 0 031 and 0 007 min 1 respectively suggesting that disinfection residuals when pfa is used may be less of a concern than with paa this faster decomposition did not affect the pfa oxidation power on estrone which was as weak as that of paa graphical abstract image graphical abstract key words peracetic acid performic acid e coli enterococci inactivation decomposition kinetics secondary effluent oxidative power 1 introduction surface drinking water sources unaffected by upstream wastewater discharges are becoming increasingly rare and this link formally recognized as the integrated water cycle can be particularly close where treated wastewaters are indirectly added to supplement potable water supplies notably in regions that are water stressed or have limited financial resources disinfection of wastewater effluents before discharge is then a key and sometimes the only process to preserve the microbiological quality of discharges to achieve sanitary and environmental objectives although identifying a level of exposure to microbiological and chemical risk in drinking water dw is relatively straightforward exposure is direct and the level of protection is maximum usually multibarrier it is more problematic for wastewater ww where the variability in quality and quantity is higher and the risk is indirect and less clearly defined this study will focus on liquid chemical disinfection systems for wastewaters chlorine with its derivatives chlorine dioxide and especially chloramines still represents the most widely adopted solution due to the numerous disinfection byproducts dbps which pose a significant health concern krasner et al 2006 daiber et al 2016 du et al 2017 richardson et al 2020 chlorine is becoming less attractive and in some cases even banned as in the case of the veneto region in italy where it has been forbidden since 2013 deliberation n 107 2009 veneto region 2009 and the canadian province of quebec gehr et al 2003 du et al 2017 provide some background to justify this approach among the several alternatives to chlorine that have emerged in the last thirty years peracetic acid paa is the best known and is used in europe and elsewhere in full scale performic acid pfa has been developed over the past 14 years but has not been widely adopted to date with the exception of cities in the region of venice italy biarritz and paris in france and berlin germany the goal of this work is to consolidate the present state of knowledge of pfa disinfection technology and to provide evidence of its suitability as an alternative to chlorine or paa for wastewater disinfection extensive long term studies at laboratory and full scale were conducted comparing the behavior of pfa with those of paa and chlorine hypochlorite hyp pfa was investigated in terms of 1 effectiveness against e coli and enterococci and rate of decomposition in comparison with the other chemical disinfectants 2 stability and reproducibility over time and in different matrices 3 potential impact on organic compounds also in comparison with paa five conventional activated sludge wwtps situated in north east italy all receiving municipal wastewaters with negligible industrial contribution 5 based on cod load were used for the full scale tests rigorous protocols of management were applied to the disinfection treatments to carry out the studies under stable and comparable conditions potential interferences and compounding effects of matrices were accounted for by using specific statistical tests the kinetics of disinfection and chemical residual decay as well as the ability of the two peroxyacids to oxidize recalcitrant organic substances were studied with typical or excess doses at laboratory scale table 1 reports the main characteristics of the two organic peracids and some evidences documented in the literature 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory and full scale methodologies and wwtp details all five wwtps treated wastewaters from approximately 60 combined sewer systems the chain of treatments was also similar comprising primary clarification activated sludge including denitrification secondary settling and final disinfection the three seaside wwtps jesolo caorle and eraclea are characterized by high flows and organic loads during the summer all treated effluents discharge into sensitive areas near the coastal zone or venice lagoon hence they are required to adopt disinfection either all year or during the summer the studies were performed during the summer over several years at both full scale and laboratory as summarized in table 2 the effectiveness of disinfectants was tested against e coli and the more resistant enterococci it was investigated at both full scale column a and laboratory scale column b to assess the overall disinfection treatment inlet outlet analysis and the bacterial reduction over time kinetics along the disinfection channel and in batch years marked in the table with an asterisk doses to stably guarantee the current 5000 e coli cfu 100 ml limit were identified in the laboratory on wwtp effluents or from historical data to ensure compliance target values corresponding to 20 of the reference limit the current for e coli and the previous 2000 cfu 100 ml for enterococci were chosen during the kinetics measurements bacterial reduction as well as disinfectant decay were measured assessments of the oxidation ability of peracids were carried out at full scale col c to further investigate the impacts of low pfa concentrations typical for disinfection and at laboratory scale col d at elevated concentrations the full scale studies were designed specifically to investigate the performance of pfa using paa and hyp as baseline comparisons at wwtps where these disinfectants were routinely used the laboratory tests were performed with the following objectives i to confirm dosages that would guarantee e coli compliance at the 20 reference limit ii to evaluate in terms of effectiveness and disinfectant decomposition the gap in performance if any between the continuous flow mixing conditions in full scale and those in batch iii to investigate the oxidation power of pfa both indirectly by thmfp test col d 2012 and directly by comparing pfa and paa in relation to recalcitrant substances hormones and anti inflammatories col d 2017 at doses in excess for disinfection 2 2 disinfection systems pfa was produced on site desinfix unit kemira oyj from hydrogen peroxide h2o2 35 50 by weight and formic acid fa 80 90 by weight which were mixed in a reactor immersed in a 20 c thermostatic bath at equilibrium the disinfection solution contained pfa from 12 to 15 w w h2o2 from 18 to 20 w w fa around 25 w w and water dosages were by gravity automatic controls of key variables such as temperature pressure flow rate guaranteed stability of the process for peracetic acid commercial solutions at approximately 15 16 and 22 w w of paa acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide respectively supplied by chimitex and p q r were stored in polyethylene tanks 30 and 50 m3 and the dose was controlled via the pumping system although pure paa is unstable the commercial product decomposes slowly due to the presence of stabilizers such as alkali metal polyphosphates dipicolinic acid or quinoline derivatives luukkonen and pekkonen 2017 hence frequent controls for titer were not necessary chlorine was dosed as hypochlorite supplied by cristalsapo and donau chemie at 12 nominal titer on a weight basis during the experiments concentrations in the stock fiberglass or hpde tanks ranged from 11 4 to 12 6 by weight specific algorithms in the interactive control systems identified for each wwtp from unpublished previous studies allowed the chlorine decay over time to be predicted enabling the dose to be controlled according to a daily estimated concentration differences between theoretical and real concentrations were on average lower than 3 since free chlorine residual concentrations at the outlet were under 0 2 mg l no de chlorination was necessary the titer of the disinfection solutions was periodically verified monthly at minimum on site for pfa and in the laboratory for paa by using iodometric for pfa paa and cerium ammonium sulphate for h2o2 titrations according to methods reported by greenspan et al 1948 the chlorine titer was verified in the laboratory in samples taken at both delivery tank trucks and plant dosage tanks by using iodometric

the methods in table 3 the trihalomethane formation potential test thmfp was used as a further indirect estimation of the pfa oxidative power at typical concentrations applied at full scale table 2 col d 2012 disinfected and control samples taken at the jesolo wwtp under controlled conditions in the laboratory according to the method reported in table 3 were exposed to an excess of chlorine 50 mg l for 24 and 48 h to assess the potential of any organic compounds present in these samples to form thms for each sample and contact time a 3 l volume was collected in a glass bottle containing 1

inflammatories and antibiotics normally present in wastewater matrices three 5 l samples of secondary effluent from the jesolo wwtp were taken to the laboratory in completely filled bottles for testing pfa or paa were added to flasks containing the effluents and stirred at temperatures from 23 to 25 c aliquots for the analysis made according to the procedures reported in table 3 were taken

experiments table 4 summarizes the average and range of variation of the main operating parameters flow rate disinfectants dosages applied contact times in the disinfection channel during the studies carried out at full scale data refer to a period of 20 months covering five summer seasons may september the caorle jesolo and eraclea facilities are seaside plants with significant daily load variations during the summer doses enabling the e coli disinfection target at the outlet were maintained with the exception of pfa when higher doses were used for testing potential mutagenic and genotoxic effects ragazzo et al 2017 3 2 wastewater quality variables the experiments were carried out at five different full scale installations nevertheless the variability of the influents into the disinfection reactors was such that the performance of the three disinfectants could be compared before entering the disinfection channel wastewater had been nitrified by biological oxidation as described above fig 1 reports for each disinfectant the box whisker plots of key physical and chemical parameters of influents to the disinfection systems nitrite being always below the detection limit of 0 02 mg l is not reported with the exception of high concentrations of ammonia the influent quality to the disinfection systems was typical of stable management from the statistical point of view nevertheless with the exception of enterococci parameter variations among the disinfectants appeared to be different p 0 01 these differences however can be explained by the presence of many values below the method detection limits which acted as tied values designating even minimal variations as significant table s1 to examine if and to what extent parameter variations can actually have influenced the disinfection processes table 5 provides evidence from the literature on the effect of such parameters on the activity of disinfectants by comparing fig 1 and table 5 it is evident that during these studies the parameters varied within ranges in which there is no significant interference with disinfectant activity except in a few cases one case was the approximately neutral value of ph that is reported to hinder the effectiveness of pfa the other exception is the significantly lower initial e coli concentrations for the full scale paa tests and the kinetics measurements with pfa and hyp compared with those of the other disinfectants whether and to what extent the initial bacterial concentrations n0 kinetically affect the bacterial reduction remains an open question four models chick chick watson hom s do not provide a strict dependence of reduction on the n0 value whereas others power and hom power do connect bacterial inactivation to n0 no correlation was found between the n0 values and the corresponding bacterial reduction for any disinfectant a positive correlation between ph and e coli reduction was found for paa r spearman 0 775 p 0 01 which worked under the optimal ph range in this study whereas for the other parameters variations were within the range in which no interferences are documented for the two peracids tss never exceeded 20 mg l and in 88 of cases they were below the method detection limit 10 mg l cod was always below 50 mg l and for nnh4 which varied from 0 1 to 10 3 mg l no interaction with peracids is reported in the literature the constant presence of nnh4 coupled with the low chlorine doses max 4 7 mg l made chlorine function mainly as chloramine over 80 of total chlorine with the predominance of monochloramine 80 to 94 at the operating ph levels no correlation was found by the spearman test between cod concentration at the disinfection inlet and chlorine demand of the matrix spearman r 0 25 and 0 17 between cod and free and total residuals of chlorine respectively 3 3 full scale effectiveness the whisker plots of fig 2 show log reductions for e coli a and enterococci b as well as applied doses c and contact times d for hyp paa and pfa table 2 col a average doses of 2 9 1 4 and 0 8 mg l and retention times of 21 31 and 18 min respectively for hyp paa and pfa always guaranteed the current e coli limit of 5000 cfu 100 ml the corresponding 1000 cfu 100 ml target for higher security of compliance was reached in 93 92 and 100 of the cases respectively hyp and paa achieved 2 and 3 log e coli reductions in 68 and 15 and 75 and 31 of the tests respectively the same reductions were achieved by pfa in 98 and 61 of the cases hyp and pfa exceeded 1 log reduction of enterococci in 69 and 83 of the cases respectively compared to 11 for paa the statistical comparison among the disinfectants identifies similar minor e coli reductions for hyp and paa compared to pfa and similar major enterococci reductions for hyp and pfa compared to paa table 6 despite the lowest doses and contact times in the disinfection reactor pfa achieved bacterial inactivations higher than paa and comparable with hyp the overall results demonstrate the following order of effectiveness pfa hyp paa chlorine which functioned mainly as monochloramine recognized to be a weak disinfectant showed an efficacy similar to paa against e coli but comparable to pfa against enterococci therefore the order of efficacy could be refined as follows pfa hyp paa against e coli and pfa hyp paa against enterococci results obtained agree with the literature that reports for laboratory and pilot studies a comparable effectiveness of hyp and paa against traditional fecal indicators such as e coli and fecal coliforms and a superiority of hyp against enterococci veschetti et al 2003 luukkonen and pekkonen 2017 droste and gehr 2019 the full scale effectiveness was further evaluated by focusing on the three disinfectants at the same plant jesolo and using pfa at eraclea to compare the effects of short contact times table 7 gives the bacterial inactivations obtained for the doses and retention times under which the disinfectants functioned the initial concentrations of e coli and enterococci were comparable at the probability 0 05 and 0 01 respectively the greater effectiveness of pfa and hyp superscript a as well as the lower effectiveness of paa superscript b were confirmed with both fecal indicators at jesolo paa worked with the lowest retention times but its lower effectiveness was confirmed in comparison with pfa at eraclea which worked at the shortest contact times these results are consistent with literature both laboratory and pilot full scale studies on the two peracids that in most cases indicates pfa as being more effective than paa i e requiring lower doses or shorter contact times for inactivating bacteria such as e coli and enterococci luukkonen and pekkonen 2017 droste and gehr 2019 a recent study by campo et al 2020 reports the greater inactivation efficiency of pfa over paa against ampicillin resistant e coli 3 4 disinfectant decomposition fig 3 shows the peracid residuals for laboratory tests and full scale measurements along the disinfection channels doses ranged from 1 to 7 mg l for paa and from 0 5 to 1 3 mg l for pfa pfa decayed more quickly with residuals from 20 to 60 of initial concentrations after 60 min contact time at the same contact time the residuals of paa were never below 60 of initial concentrations independently of dose this is consistent with literature results documenting a faster decomposition of pfa compared with paa in secondary effluents campo et al 2020 tertiary effluents luukkonen et al 2015 and csos chhetri et al 2014 peracid decomposition was modelled using zero first and second order models and the resulting kinetic parameter values are reported in table 8 the immediate consumption of disinfectant d was obtained with non linear regression using the microsoft excel solver function grgnonlinear luukkonen et al 2015 considering all dosages pfa decay is well described by 1st and 2nd order kinetic models modelling was improved with correction for the disinfectant demand d but at doses around 1 mg l decay is well represented even by the 0 order model with and without d average of r2 0 930 and 0 880 respectively the paa decay was similarly well represented by 1st and 2nd order models by introducing the immediate initial consumption d the fitting improves at doses around 1 mg l where all models seem reliable average k from 0 009 to 0 01 and r2 from 0 853 to 0 880 in all cases the k values follow the order pfa paa and using the 1st order model with and without d decay of pfa was from 1 3 2 and 4 6 4 8 times faster than paa at doses around 1 mg l and all applied doses respectively the 1st order model k values for both paa and pfa with and without d are in the same range as those documented by falsanisi et al 2006 rossi et al 2007 and luukkonen et al 2015 all these results show that paa residuals will be more likely than pfa to show up in treated effluents which can be a concern for both the potential toxic effects on aquatic life and the effects on micro fauna growth due to the acetic acid as a decomposition product and as a component of the original disinfection solution literature reports the biodegradability in terms of bod5 from 3 to 9 times higher for paa than for pfa per unit of disinfectant dosed table 1 3 5 bacterial inactivation kinetics table 9 compares e coli and enterococci inactivation obtained by each disinfectant during the kinetic studies made both at full and laboratory scale for the several contact time intervals and the corresponding average doses of disinfectant applied the kruskal wallis test evaluates whether the medians of bacterial reductions are equal across the treatments dosages are reported as average standard errors bacterial reductions as medians and range of variation considering all the kinetics dosages of hyp paa and pfa ranged around 3 70 0 50 3 04 0 49 and 1 33 0 54 mg l respectively against both fecal indicators the three disinfectants at their respective doses showed comparable bacterial inactivation in each time interval except two with the more recalcitrant enterococci against enterococci at short contact times 9 min the order of inactivation was hyp pfa and pfa paa while for high contact times 45 min it changed to pfa paa and paa hyp in the first case hyp which probably functioned also as free chlorine achieved the highest bacterial inactivation 69 reductions over 1 log and paa the lowest as 67 of the reductions were below 1 log pfa exceeded 1 log reductions in 50 of cases at high retention times hyp behaved mainly as combined compound and paa reached enterococci inactivation similar to pfa this agrees with our earlier work ragazzo et al 2013 which documents a progressive increase of effectiveness of paa against enterococci over time on the other hand by considering the disinfectant doses applied for each time interval the order of effectiveness was generally pfa paa hyp except in the two cases discussed above 9 min and 45 min where the disinfectants effectiveness corresponded to the order of enterococci inactivation achieved 3 6 qualitative impacts investigations of the ability of pfa to oxidize organic matter at typical full scale doses table 2 cols c and d 2012 lead to the results reported in tables 10 and 11 organohalogenated compounds and chlorophenols were mostly under their quantification limits at both the disinfection inlet and outlet for which chloride and bromide concentrations were between 170 and 200 and 0 24 and 0 28 mg l respectively the slight increase in toluene in the first sample as well as the constant phenol decrease revealed from inlet to outlet cannot be considered significant because they are close to the method detection limits 44 uncertainty of measurements no substituted phenols were found hence potential reaction with secondary oxidants formed by pfa can be excluded this agrees with results of veijalainen et al 2009 who documented for pfa negligible bromophenol increase and no chlorophenol formation in secondary wastewater spiked with 0 5 mg l of phenol and 250 mg nacl l or 130 mg nabr l the qualitative screenings on the same samples p t and l l gc ms showed chromatographic profiles of volatile organic substances and substituted aldehydes and ketones similar to those obtained during periods of non disinfection the qualitative investigation of pfa s potential impacts on some categories of organic compounds such as pesticides pharmaceutical compounds personal care products pfas and carboxylic acids performed at 4 wwtps doses and retention times between 0 3 and 0 6 mg l and 11 and 45 min respectively revealed no changes in chromatographic profiles of disinfected and non disinfected samples aldehydes formaldehyde acetaldehyde acrolein etc analyzed in the same samples were below the quantification limit 0 01 mg l both before and after disinfection confirming results reported by veijalainen et al 2009 and ragazzo et al 2013 table 11 reports results obtained by the thmfp test on jesolo secondary effluents disinfected with pfa table 2 column d 2012 the thmfp values refer to raw samples the blank thmfp value in ultrapure water used for dilution was 5 9 Âµg l the hypothesis was that if pfa had been even partially able to oxidize the organic compounds it would have affected their structure such that their reaction with chlorine would have been different hence treated and untreated effluents would have had a different thmfp the t student and anova tests show that the differences in the thmfp between disinfected and non disinfected effluents for both exposure times were not statistically significant p 0 05 thus at doses from 0 6 to 1 2 mg l and average contact time of 30 min pfa was unable to increase the reactivity to chlorine of organic compounds present in secondary effluents and to form thms if thms can be interpreted as surrogates of dbps formation with this type of matrix thms are generally produced in greater quantities compared to other chlorine based dbps this can suggest a weak ability of pfa under these conditions to oxidize organic compounds and form significant concentrations of dbps table 12 compares the oxidative power of 2 10 and 20 mg l pfa and paa on compounds such as hormones and pharmaceutical molecules present in effluents table 2 column d 2017 with estrone as the model compound no significant impact for any peracid was revealed the variations measured cannot be considered significant considering the uncertainty associated with the measurements 44 the same evidence was obtained for 17 alpha ethinylestradiol and 17 beta estradiol whose values remained lower than their quantification limits 50 and 100 ng l respectively 4 conclusions for typical disinfection contact times 20 30 min at doses set to guarantee the current effluent limit for e coli of 5000 cfu 100 ml paa and hyp required ct values three and four times higher on average respectively than pfa under these conditions only pfa always guaranteed the more ambitious target of 1000 cfu 100 ml e coli and obtained the best performances against the most resistant fecal indicator enterococci similar bacterial reductions for peracids were found at the higher disinfectant doses of the kinetic tests at ct for paa four times higher on average than for pfa under those conditions all disinfectants showed similar bacterial inactivation except for two cases against the more recalcitrant enterococci a at short contact times 9 min where a larger fraction of hyp was free chlorine and only pfa showed inactivation comparable to hyp and b for contact times over 30 min where hyp was mainly chloramine and paa reached enterococci reductions close to pfa and higher than hyp thus pfa appears to be more effective with respect to paa especially when operational situations are difficult such as at low retention times and against the more resistant fecal indicator enterococci pfa decays more quickly than paa suggesting that pfa residuals discharged into the environment with the effluent would be less of a concern to aquatic fauna compared to paa this tendency towards faster decomposition does not change the oxidation power of pfa towards organic substances which is confirmed to be as weak as paa at all doses applied in these studies declaration of competing

17698,chemical disinfection of municipal wastewater to preserve the microbiological quality of discharges has traditionally relied on chlorine and more recently on peracetic acid paa a more recent option is performic acid pfa this work uses laboratory and full scale studies over a span of 15 years and five wastewater treatment plants wwtps in italy to compare the efficacy of these three disinfectants and identify the differences among peracids in a context where both can be an alternative to chlorine the investigations focused on treatment effectiveness and bacterial inactivation kinetics using e coli and the more resistant enterococci as well as on pfa and paa decomposition as the residuals may affect the downstream microenvironment furthermore the potential for the two peracids to oxidize organic substances and create troublesome byproducts was also studied chlorine applied as hypochlorite hyp and here essentially functioning as chloramines was used as a baseline comparison for the two peracids appropriate statistical tests were applied to the data from different wwtps to account for potential interferences and compounding effects of the different matrices average doses of 0 8 2 9 and 1 4 mg l and contact times of 18 21 and 31 min respectively for pfa chlorine and paa guaranteed with a high level of assurance the 5000 cfu 100 ml e coli limit the order of effectiveness was pfa hyp paa refined as pfa hyp paa against e coli and pfa hyp paa with enterococci similar bacterial reductions for the peracids were found at higher disinfectant doses used for the kinetic tests pfa decayed more quickly than paa the first order decay constants were 0 031 and 0 007 min 1 respectively suggesting that disinfection residuals when pfa is used may be less of a concern than with paa this faster decomposition did not affect the pfa oxidation power on estrone which was as weak as that of paa graphical abstract image graphical abstract key words peracetic acid performic acid e coli enterococci inactivation decomposition kinetics secondary effluent oxidative power 1 introduction surface drinking water sources unaffected by upstream wastewater discharges are becoming increasingly rare and this link formally recognized as the integrated water cycle can be particularly close where treated wastewaters are indirectly added to supplement potable water supplies notably in regions that are water stressed or have limited financial resources disinfection of wastewater effluents before discharge is then a key and sometimes the only process to preserve the microbiological quality of discharges to achieve sanitary and environmental objectives although identifying a level of exposure to microbiological and chemical risk in drinking water dw is relatively straightforward exposure is direct and the level of protection is maximum usually multibarrier it is more problematic for wastewater ww where the variability in quality and quantity is higher and the risk is indirect and less clearly defined this study will focus on liquid chemical disinfection systems for wastewaters chlorine with its derivatives chlorine dioxide and especially chloramines still represents the most widely adopted solution due to the numerous disinfection byproducts dbps which pose a significant health concern krasner et al 2006 daiber et al 2016 du et al 2017 richardson et al 2020 chlorine is becoming less attractive and in some cases even banned as in the case of the veneto region in italy where it has been forbidden since 2013 deliberation n 107 2009 veneto region 2009 and the canadian province of quebec gehr et al 2003 du et al 2017 provide some background to justify this approach among the several alternatives to chlorine that have emerged in the last thirty years peracetic acid paa is the best known and is used in europe and elsewhere in full scale performic acid pfa has been developed over the past 14 years but has not been widely adopted to date with the exception of cities in the region of venice italy biarritz and paris in france and berlin germany the goal of this work is to consolidate the present state of knowledge of pfa disinfection technology and to provide evidence of its suitability as an alternative to chlorine or paa for wastewater disinfection extensive long term studies at laboratory and full scale were conducted comparing the behavior of pfa with those of paa and chlorine hypochlorite hyp pfa was investigated in terms of 1 effectiveness against e coli and enterococci and rate of decomposition in comparison with the other chemical disinfectants 2 stability and reproducibility over time and in different matrices 3 potential impact on organic compounds also in comparison with paa five conventional activated sludge wwtps situated in north east italy all receiving municipal wastewaters with negligible industrial contribution 5 based on cod load were used for the full scale tests rigorous protocols of management were applied to the disinfection treatments to carry out the studies under stable and comparable conditions potential interferences and compounding effects of matrices were accounted for by using specific statistical tests the kinetics of disinfection and chemical residual decay as well as the ability of the two peroxyacids to oxidize recalcitrant organic substances were studied with typical or excess doses at laboratory scale table 1 reports the main characteristics of the two organic peracids and some evidences documented in the literature 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory and full scale methodologies and wwtp details all five wwtps treated wastewaters from approximately 60 combined sewer systems the chain of treatments was also similar comprising primary clarification activated sludge including denitrification secondary settling and final disinfection the three seaside wwtps jesolo caorle and eraclea are characterized by high flows and organic loads during the summer all treated effluents discharge into sensitive areas near the coastal zone or venice lagoon hence they are required to adopt disinfection either all year or during the summer the studies were performed during the summer over several years at both full scale and laboratory as summarized in table 2 the effectiveness of disinfectants was tested against e coli and the more resistant enterococci it was investigated at both full scale column a and laboratory scale column b to assess the overall disinfection treatment inlet outlet analysis and the bacterial reduction over time kinetics along the disinfection channel and in batch years marked in the table with an asterisk doses to stably guarantee the current 5000 e coli cfu 100 ml limit were identified in the laboratory on wwtp effluents or from historical data to ensure compliance target values corresponding to 20 of the reference limit the current for e coli and the previous 2000 cfu 100 ml for enterococci were chosen during the kinetics measurements bacterial reduction as well as disinfectant decay were measured assessments of the oxidation ability of peracids were carried out at full scale col c to further investigate the impacts of low pfa concentrations typical for disinfection and at laboratory scale col d at elevated concentrations the full scale studies were designed specifically to investigate the performance of pfa using paa and hyp as baseline comparisons at wwtps where these disinfectants were routinely used the laboratory tests were performed with the following objectives i to confirm dosages that would guarantee e coli compliance at the 20 reference limit ii to evaluate in terms of effectiveness and disinfectant decomposition the gap in performance if any between the continuous flow mixing conditions in full scale and those in batch iii to investigate the oxidation power of pfa both indirectly by thmfp test col d 2012 and directly by comparing pfa and paa in relation to recalcitrant substances hormones and anti inflammatories col d 2017 at doses in excess for disinfection 2 2 disinfection systems pfa was produced on site desinfix unit kemira oyj from hydrogen peroxide h2o2 35 50

20 w w fa around 25 w w and water dosages were by gravity automatic controls of key variables such as temperature pressure flow rate guaranteed stability of the process for peracetic acid commercial solutions at approximately 15 16 and 22 w w of paa acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide respectively supplied by chimitex and p q r were stored in polyethylene tanks 30 and 50 m3 and the dose was controlled via the pumping system although pure paa is unstable the commercial product decomposes slowly due to the presence of stabilizers such as alkali metal polyphosphates dipicolinic acid or quinoline derivatives luukkonen and pekkonen 2017 hence frequent controls for titer were not necessary chlorine was dosed as hypochlorite supplied by cristalsapo and donau chemie at 12 nominal titer on a weight basis during the experiments concentrations in the stock fiberglass or hpde tanks ranged from 11 4 to 12 6 by weight specific algorithms in the interactive control systems identified for each wwtp from unpublished previous studies allowed the chlorine decay over time to be predicted enabling the dose to be controlled according to a daily estimated concentration differences between theoretical and real concentrations were on average lower than 3 since free chlorine residual concentrations at the outlet were under 0 2 mg l no de chlorination was necessary the titer of the disinfection solutions was periodically verified monthly at minimum on site for pfa and in the laboratory for paa by using iodometric for pfa paa and cerium ammonium sulphate for h2o2 titrations according to methods reported by greenspan et al 1948 the chlorine titer was verified in the laboratory in samples taken at both delivery tank trucks and plant dosage tanks by using iodometric

described above fig 1 reports for each disinfectant the box whisker plots of key physical and chemical parameters of influents to the disinfection systems nitrite being always below the detection limit of 0 02 mg l is not reported with the exception of high concentrations of ammonia the influent quality to the disinfection systems was typical of stable management from the statistical point of view nevertheless with the exception of enterococci parameter variations among the disinfectants appeared to be different p 0 01 these differences however can be explained by the presence of many values below the method detection limits which acted as tied values designating even minimal variations as significant table s1 to examine if and to what extent parameter variations can actually have influenced the disinfection processes table 5 provides evidence from the literature on the effect of such parameters on the activity of disinfectants by comparing fig 1 and table 5 it is evident that during these studies the parameters varied within ranges in which there is no significant interference with disinfectant activity except in a few cases one case was the approximately neutral value of ph that is reported to hinder the effectiveness of pfa the other exception is the significantly lower initial e coli concentrations for the full scale paa tests and the kinetics measurements with pfa and hyp compared with those of the other disinfectants whether and to what extent the initial bacterial concentrations n0 kinetically affect the bacterial reduction remains an open question four models chick chick watson hom s do not provide a strict dependence of reduction on the n0 value whereas others power and hom power do connect bacterial inactivation to n0 no correlation was found between the n0 values and the corresponding bacterial reduction for any disinfectant a positive correlation between ph and e coli reduction was found for paa r spearman 0 775 p 0 01 which worked under the optimal ph range in this study whereas for the other parameters variations were within the range in which no interferences are documented for the two peracids tss never exceeded 20 mg l and in 88 of cases they were below the method detection limit 10 mg l cod was always below 50 mg l and for nnh4 which varied from 0 1 to 10 3 mg l no interaction with peracids is reported in the literature the constant presence of nnh4 coupled with the low chlorine doses max 4 7 mg l made chlorine function mainly as chloramine over 80 of total chlorine with the predominance of monochloramine 80 to 94 at the operating ph levels no correlation was found by the spearman test between cod concentration at the disinfection inlet and chlorine demand of the matrix spearman r 0 25 and 0 17 between cod and free and total residuals of chlorine respectively 3 3 full scale effectiveness the whisker plots of fig 2 show log reductions for e coli a and enterococci b as well as applied doses c and contact times d for hyp paa and pfa table 2 col a average doses of 2 9 1 4 and 0 8 mg l and retention times of 21 31 and 18 min respectively for hyp paa and pfa always guaranteed the current e coli limit of 5000 cfu 100 ml the corresponding 1000 cfu 100 ml target for higher security of compliance was reached in 93 92 and 100 of the cases respectively hyp and paa achieved 2 and 3 log e coli reductions in 68 and 15 and 75 and 31 of the tests respectively the same reductions were achieved by pfa in 98 and 61 of the cases hyp and pfa exceeded 1 log reduction of enterococci in 69 and 83 of the cases respectively compared to 11 for paa the statistical comparison among the disinfectants identifies similar minor e coli reductions for hyp and paa compared to pfa and similar major enterococci reductions for hyp and pfa compared to paa table 6 despite the lowest doses and contact times in the disinfection reactor pfa achieved bacterial inactivations higher than paa and comparable with hyp the overall results demonstrate the following order of effectiveness pfa hyp paa chlorine which functioned mainly as monochloramine recognized to be a weak disinfectant showed an efficacy similar to paa against e coli but comparable to pfa against enterococci therefore the order of efficacy could be refined as follows pfa hyp paa against e coli and pfa hyp paa against enterococci results obtained agree with the literature that reports for laboratory and pilot studies a comparable effectiveness of hyp and paa against traditional fecal indicators such as e coli and fecal coliforms and a superiority of hyp against enterococci veschetti et al 2003 luukkonen and pekkonen 2017 droste and gehr 2019 the full scale effectiveness was further evaluated by focusing on the three disinfectants at the same plant jesolo and using pfa at eraclea to compare the effects of short contact times table 7 gives the bacterial inactivations obtained for the doses and retention times under which the disinfectants functioned the initial concentrations of e coli and enterococci were comparable at the probability 0 05 and 0 01 respectively the greater effectiveness of pfa and hyp superscript a as well as the lower effectiveness of paa superscript b were confirmed with both fecal indicators at jesolo paa worked with the lowest retention times but its lower effectiveness was confirmed in comparison with pfa at eraclea which worked at the shortest contact times these results are consistent with literature both laboratory and pilot full scale studies on the two peracids that in most cases indicates pfa as being more effective than paa i e requiring lower doses or shorter contact times for inactivating bacteria such as e coli and enterococci luukkonen and pekkonen 2017 droste and gehr 2019 a recent study by campo et al 2020 reports the greater inactivation efficiency of pfa over paa against ampicillin resistant e coli 3 4 disinfectant decomposition fig 3 shows the peracid residuals for laboratory tests and full scale measurements along the disinfection channels doses ranged from 1 to 7 mg l for paa and from 0 5 to 1 3 mg l for pfa pfa decayed more quickly with residuals from 20 to 60 of initial concentrations after 60 min contact time at the same contact time the residuals of paa were never below 60 of initial concentrations independently of dose this is consistent with literature results documenting a faster decomposition of pfa compared with paa in secondary effluents campo et al 2020 tertiary effluents luukkonen et al 2015 and csos chhetri et al 2014 peracid decomposition was modelled using zero first and second order models and the resulting kinetic parameter values are reported in table 8 the immediate consumption of disinfectant d was obtained with non linear regression using the microsoft excel solver function grgnonlinear luukkonen et al 2015 considering all dosages pfa decay is well described by 1st and 2nd order kinetic models modelling was improved with correction for the disinfectant demand d but at doses around 1 mg l decay is well represented even by the 0 order model with and without d average of r2 0 930 and 0 880 respectively the paa decay was similarly well represented by 1st and 2nd order models by introducing the immediate initial consumption d the fitting improves at doses around 1 mg l where all models seem reliable average k from 0 009 to 0 01 and r2 from 0 853 to 0 880 in all cases the k values follow the order pfa paa and using the 1st order model with and without d decay of pfa was from 1 3 2 and 4 6 4 8 times faster than paa at doses around 1 mg l and all applied doses respectively the 1st order model k values for both paa and pfa with and without d are in the same range as those documented by falsanisi et al 2006 rossi et al 2007 and luukkonen et al 2015 all these results show that paa residuals will be more likely than pfa to show up in treated effluents which can be a concern for both the potential toxic effects on aquatic life and the effects on micro fauna growth due to the acetic acid as a decomposition product and as a component of the original disinfection solution literature reports the biodegradability in terms of bod5 from 3 to 9 times higher for paa than for pfa per unit of disinfectant dosed table 1 3 5 bacterial inactivation kinetics table 9 compares e coli and enterococci inactivation obtained by each disinfectant during the kinetic studies made both at full and laboratory scale for the several contact time intervals and the corresponding average doses of disinfectant applied the kruskal wallis test evaluates whether the medians of bacterial reductions are equal across the treatments dosages are reported as average standard errors bacterial reductions as medians and range of variation considering all the kinetics dosages of hyp paa and pfa ranged around 3 70 0 50 3 04 0 49 and 1 33 0 54 mg l respectively against both fecal indicators the three disinfectants at their respective doses showed comparable bacterial inactivation in each time interval except two with the more recalcitrant enterococci against enterococci at short contact times 9 min the order of inactivation was hyp pfa and pfa paa while for high contact times 45 min it changed to pfa paa and paa hyp in the first case hyp which probably functioned also as free chlorine achieved the highest bacterial inactivation 69 reductions over 1 log and paa the lowest as 67 of the reductions were below 1 log pfa exceeded 1 log reductions in 50 of cases at high retention times hyp behaved mainly as combined compound and paa reached enterococci inactivation similar to pfa this agrees with our earlier work ragazzo et al 2013 which documents a progressive increase of effectiveness of paa against enterococci over time on the other hand by considering the disinfectant doses applied for each time interval the order of effectiveness was generally pfa paa hyp except in the two cases discussed above 9 min and 45 min where the disinfectants effectiveness corresponded to the order of enterococci inactivation achieved 3 6 qualitative impacts investigations of the ability of pfa to oxidize organic matter at typical full scale doses table 2 cols c and d 2012 lead to the results reported in tables 10 and 11 organohalogenated compounds and chlorophenols were mostly under their quantification limits at both the disinfection inlet and outlet for which chloride and bromide concentrations were between 170 and 200 and 0 24 and 0 28 mg l respectively the slight increase in toluene in the first sample as well as the constant phenol decrease revealed from inlet to outlet cannot be considered significant because they are close to the method detection limits 44 uncertainty of measurements no substituted phenols were found hence potential reaction with secondary oxidants formed by pfa can be excluded this agrees with results of veijalainen et al 2009 who documented for pfa negligible bromophenol increase and no chlorophenol formation in secondary wastewater spiked with 0 5 mg l of phenol and 250 mg nacl l or 130 mg nabr l the qualitative screenings on the same samples p t and l l gc ms showed chromatographic profiles of volatile organic substances and substituted aldehydes and ketones similar to those obtained during periods of non disinfection the qualitative investigation of pfa s potential impacts on some categories of organic compounds such as pesticides pharmaceutical compounds personal care products pfas and carboxylic acids performed at 4 wwtps doses and retention times between 0 3 and 0 6 mg l and 11 and 45 min respectively revealed no changes in chromatographic profiles of disinfected and non disinfected samples aldehydes formaldehyde acetaldehyde acrolein etc analyzed in the same samples were below the quantification limit 0 01 mg l both before and after disinfection confirming results reported by veijalainen et al 2009 and ragazzo et al 2013 table 11 reports results obtained by the thmfp test on jesolo secondary effluents disinfected with pfa table 2 column d 2012 the thmfp values refer to raw samples the blank thmfp value in ultrapure water used for dilution was 5 9 Âµg l the hypothesis was that if pfa had been even partially able to oxidize the organic compounds it would have affected their structure such that their reaction with chlorine would have been different hence treated and untreated effluents would have had a different thmfp the t student and anova tests show that the differences in the thmfp between disinfected and non disinfected effluents for both exposure times were not statistically significant p 0 05 thus at doses from 0 6 to 1 2 mg l and average contact time of 30 min pfa was unable to increase the reactivity to chlorine of organic compounds present in secondary effluents and to form thms if thms can be interpreted as surrogates of dbps formation with this type of matrix thms are generally produced in greater quantities compared to other chlorine based dbps this can suggest a weak ability of pfa under these conditions to oxidize organic compounds and form significant concentrations of dbps table 12 compares the oxidative power of 2 10 and 20 mg l pfa and paa on compounds such as hormones and pharmaceutical molecules present in effluents table 2 column d 2017 with estrone as the model compound no significant impact for any peracid was revealed the variations measured cannot be considered significant considering the uncertainty associated with the measurements 44 the same evidence was obtained for 17 alpha ethinylestradiol and 17 beta estradiol whose values remained lower than their quantification limits 50 and 100 ng l respectively 4 conclusions for typical disinfection contact times 20 30 min at doses set to guarantee the current effluent limit for e coli of 5000 cfu 100 ml paa and hyp required ct values three and four times higher on average respectively than pfa under these conditions only pfa always guaranteed the more ambitious target of 1000 cfu 100 ml e coli and obtained the best performances against the most resistant fecal indicator enterococci similar bacterial reductions for peracids were found at the higher disinfectant doses of the kinetic tests at ct for paa four times higher on average than for pfa under those conditions all disinfectants showed similar bacterial inactivation except for two cases against the more recalcitrant enterococci a at short contact times 9 min where a larger fraction of hyp was free chlorine and only pfa showed inactivation comparable to hyp and b for contact times over 30 min where hyp was mainly chloramine and paa reached enterococci reductions close to pfa and higher than hyp thus pfa appears to be more effective with respect to paa especially when operational situations are difficult such as at low retention times and against the more resistant fecal indicator enterococci pfa decays more quickly than paa suggesting that pfa residuals discharged into the environment with the effluent would be less of a concern to aquatic fauna compared to paa this tendency towards faster decomposition does not change the oxidation power of pfa towards organic substances which is confirmed to be as weak as paa at all doses applied in these studies declaration of competing

17699,this work evaluated the formation of transformation products tps during the degradation of diazepam dzp by a solar photo fenton process six tps were identified three of them for the first time after elucidation of the tps a new cheap fast and easy method was employed to extract and preconcentrate dzp and its tps using dispersive liquid liquid microextraction dllme the method was optimized using factorial and doehlert designs with the best results obtained using acetonitrile as disperser solvent and chloroform as extraction solvent with volumes of 1000 and 650 Âµl respectively when dzp degradation was performed in ultrapure water the extraction preconcentration of dzp and its tps by dllme was very similar to the results obtained using a traditional spe method however when hospital wastewater was used as the matrix more limited extraction efficiency was obtained using dllme compared to spe meanwhile all the tps extracted by spe were also extracted by the dllme technique furthermore dllme was much less expensive than spe besides being faster easier and requiring only small amounts of organic solvents this work reports a new and very important tool for the extraction and preconcentration of tps formed during degradation using techniques such as advanced oxidation processes aops since without this step it would not be possible to identify all the tps formed in some complex wastewater matrices graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords advanced oxidation processes pathway extraction technique doehlert optimization in silico risk assessment 1 introduction neurological disorders such as epilepsy among others are some of the most important classes of diseases affecting the global population the treatment of these illnesses frequently involves the prescription of benzodiazepines with diazepam dzp being one of the most important of these compounds dzp has anticonvulsant anxiolytic sedative and muscle relaxant properties dudley et al 2019 sulaiman 2017 it has been estimated that following ingestion 5 50 of the dzp dose is excreted unchanged consequently entering the environment west and rowland 2012 in a previous study becker et al 2020 reported that dzp is commonly found in hospital wastewater rhw in aquatic environments dzp has been detected in a wide range of concentrations ranging from 20 ng l 1 river water to 600 ng l 1 hospital wastewater almeida et al 2015 khan et al 2018 the widespread global consumption of dzp and its constant release into the environment have stimulated studies of the degradation of this pharmaceutical conventional wastewater treatments are unable to completely eliminate this type of compound so the development and application of advanced oxidation processes aops may offer a solution since they can provide highly effective and rapid degradation of organic compounds bosio et al 2019 the efficiency of aops is due to the formation of hydroxyl radicals ho which are highly oxidizing very reactive and non selective bautitz and nogueira 2010 the degradation of dzp has been studied using different aops including heterogeneous photocatalysis bosio et al 2019 sulaiman 2017 and the heterogeneous photo fenton process valcÃ¡rcel et al 2012 although these processes are attractive options for use in dzp degradation they employ artificial sources of uv irradiation as a more environmentally friendly approach the use of solar radiation can considerably reduce the cost of the treatment making the solar photo fenton spf process one of the most economic and efficient techniques bautitz and nogueira 2010 gimÃ©nez et al 2015 the use of the spf process for degradation of dzp has been shown to be a viable option bautitz and nogueira 2010 cuervo lumbaque et al 2019 despite dzp being considered a recalcitrant compound banaschik et al 2018 kosjek et al 2012 nonetheless it is very important to investigate the formation of transformation products tps that may be more toxic than the parent compound lambropoulou and nollet 2014 postigo and richardson 2014 evaluation of the formation of tps requires sensitive techniques such as uhplc qtof ms for their identification using exact masses since commercial standards are not usually available in addition predictions of toxicity biodegradability mutagenicity and carcinogenicity provide valuable information about tps for this purpose computational methods such as qsar quantitative structure activity relationships vega and epi suite among other methodologies are increasingly used for assessment of the environmental risk of different compounds including tps della flora et al 2020 jentzsch et al 2016 westphal et al 2020 yuval et al 2017 it is important to be able to detect the maximum possible number of tps formed during a degradation process because sometimes the less abundant tp could be the most toxic mutagenic carcinogenic intermediate to do this it is necessary to use methodologies for the extraction and preconcentration of the tps formed since they may be present at very low concentrations currently solid phase extraction spe is the technique most widely used for this purpose campos maÃ±as et al 2019 senta et al 2019 however although this methodology is very efficient and a large number of different solid phase extractants are commercially available it requires large volumes of solvents and can involve lengthy procedures as an alternative microextraction using dispersive liquid liquid microextraction dllme is very fast simple environmentally friendly and less expensive this technique which was proposed in 2006 rezaee et al 2006 uses only a few microliters of extraction and disperser solvents and can be applied for different organic compounds present in a variety of matrices carasek et al 2018 the present work has two aspects firstly identification was made of the tps formed during an spf process for the degradation of dzp together with a predictive risk assessment of these compounds secondly an optimized methodology for the extraction of dzp and its tps by dllme was developed which was applied for the spf degradation of dzp in three different aqueous matrices ultrapure water upw simulated wastewater sw and raw hospital wastewater rhw 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals diazepam 98 and diazepam d5 sigma aldrich usa were used to chromatographic analyses methanol lc ms grade from merck germany ultrapure water 18 2 mÏ cm millipore usa and formic acid 98 100 from sigma aldrich usa were used spf experiments were

chloroform p a trichlorethylene p a and dichloromethane p a were tested to compare dllme to a traditional preconcentration method spe oasis hlb 6 ml 200 mg cartridges were used 2 2 instrumentation all

information was recorded over the m z range from 50 to 1200 using a scan rate of 2 hz the bbcid mode allows operation with two different collision energies low collision energy of 10 ev ms and high collision energy variation from 20 ev to 40 ev ms ms all data were processed using dataanalysis 4 2 software and targetanalysis 1 3 both from brukerdaltonics 2 3 primary elimination of diazepam and tps identification the spf process for the degradation of dzp prior to identification of the tps was carried out using a solar batch photoreactor 1 l equipped with a magnetic stirrer before the experiments the initial ph of the dzp solution was adjusted to 5 0 using h2so4 0 05 mol l 1 after initial tests this ph was selected because use of the classical photo fenton ph 2 8 3 0 bassam et al 2012 would imply higher reagent consumption for acidification of the medium after ph adjustment addition was made of 5 mg l 1 fe2 using a 10 g l 1 fe2 stock solution and hydrogen peroxide at an initial concentration of 50 mg l 1 using a 35 w v solution in this order followed by exposure to solar radiation for initiation of the treatment process the solar uv radiation was measured with a solar energy meter sp 2000 icel which provided data in terms of incident uv w m 2 these data were used to calculate the t30w values nogueira et al 2005 an initial solution of dzp at a concentration of 1000 Î¼g l 1 prepared in ultrapure water upw was used to identify tps formed during the degradation process subsequently different water matrices and initial dzp concentrations were employed in the experimental assays detailed in section 2 7 the reaction time was initially obtained as the clock time with subsequent transformation to t30w after the experiment during the treatment process eight samples were collected at different times filtered using a 0 22 Âµm pvdf syringe filter and analyzed by lc qtof ms to identify the formation of possible tps considering the appearance of new chromatographic peaks during the process data from the tp analyses were processed using data analysis 4 2 software selecting the elemental composition and double bond equivalency dbe options in most cases possible elemental compositions for the ions were assigned with a maximum error of 5 ppm after the identification of tps a dzp degradation pathway was proposed 2 4 in silico quantitative structure activity relationship qsar models used for prediction and risk assessment the structure of the dzp and its tps were transformed into smiles strings by means of chembiodraw ultra v 12 and subjected to in silico predictions by freely available and different software and models the log kow and log bcf values were predicted by epi suite kowwin v1 68 and bcfbaf v3 01 programs respectively the persistence and biodegradability were predicted by epi suite biowin v4 10 the predicted ready biodegradability of the combined biowin 1 7 models boethling and costanza 2010 pavan and worth 2008 is

prediction is no us epa 2012 the prometheus software pizzo et al 2016 was used for predicting and ranking the dzp and tps depending on its persistence p bioaccumulation b and toxicity t i e pbt

predicted by means of vega qsar v 1 1 4 software benfenati et al 2013 and case ultra chakravarti et al 2012 saiakhov et al 2014 2013 a consensus approach was used by applying the mutagenicity ames

ich m7 guidelines for mutagenicity was applied as well ich 2017 2 5 analytical measurements during the spf treatment process during all the spf treatments the total iron and hydrogen peroxide concentrations were monitored the total iron content was determined by a colorimetric method employing 1 10 phenanthroline according to iso 1988 using a cary 50 uv vis spectrophotometer hydrogen peroxide was determined by a spectrophotometric method employing ammonium metavanadate nogueira et al 2005 2 6 dllme method preconcentration using the dllme technique was performed to improve the detection of tps during dzp degradation in preliminary tests the best combination of extraction solvent es and disperser solvent ds was selected for maximizing analyte extraction efficiency for this nine es ds pairs were evaluated chloroform acetonitrile chloroform methanol chloroform ethanol trichloroethylene acetonitrile trichloroethylene methanol trichloroethylene ethanol dichloromethane acetonitrile dichloromethane methanol and dichloromethane ethanol in these tests a spf degradation process was performed under the same conditions as the experiment for identification of the tps with treatment for 120 min the volumes of es and ds were initially set at 100 and 400 Î¼l respectively a 7 5 ml aliquot of the sample was transferred to a glass centrifugation tube with a conical base the solvent mixture was rapidly dispersed in the sample resulting in the instantaneous formation of an emulsion microdrops the emulsion was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min after which the organic phase was removed using a microsyringe and transferred to a 2 ml chromatography vial the solvent was evaporated under a gentle stream of nitrogen and the extract was reconstituted with 500 Âµl of water methanol 90 10 v v prior to analysis using uhplc qtof ms the ds es combination that provided the best extraction of dzp and its tps was selected and a 23 factorial design with a central point was used to evaluate the effects of the ds and es volumes as well as the ionic strength na2so4 concentration an optimization of the experimental dllme conditions was then performed according to a doehlert design with the volumes of ds and es as the variables 2 7 dllme method for extraction of tps in different matrices the optimized dllme variables for extraction of the tps were tested in new spf assays performed using the different matrices upw sw and rhw under the same spf conditions described above but with an initial dzp concentration of 500 Âµg l 1 the sw composition was adapted from oecd oecd 2001 simulating the organic content of real hospital wastewater as follows 160 mg l 1 of peptone 110 mg l 1 of beef extract 30 mg l 1 of urea 2 mg l 1 of mg2so4 7h2o and 4 mg l 1 of cacl2 2h2o for the analysis using rhw a sample of wastewater was collected at a hospital in the city of porto alegre rio grande do sul brazil all the degradation experiments using the different matrices were carried out in duplicate 2 8 cost and time evaluation of the dllme technique the cost and time requirements of the dllme method were obtained considering the value of the reagents and the extraction time and were compared to a standard spe method hernÃ¡ndez et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 elucidation of proposed transformation products since tps may be generated in low concentrations during a degradation process an initial experiment was performed to identify the tps using a solution of dzp at 1000 Âµg l 1 in upw without application of any extraction or preconcentration method before addition of ferrous iron and hydrogen peroxide the ph of the solution was adjusted to 5 the spf process was carried out for 120 min with aliquots collected at 0 15 30 45 60 90 and 120 min in order to stop the degradation process the hydrogen peroxide was quenched with excess of sodium bisulfite the results obtained for the total iron concentration hydrogen peroxide consumption and dzp degradation are provided in section s1 supplementary material after the spf process the collected samples were filtered and analyzed by lc qtof ms for identification of possible tps based on the appearance of new chromatographic peaks this resulted in the identification of five proposed tps tp1 tp5 after optimization of the dllme process section 3 3 additional samples were collected for lc qtof ms analyses in order to discover any possible tps that had not been identified in the first experiment but were detectable after sample preconcentration by dllme this resulted in the identification and proposal of another new tp tp6 showing the importance of using a suitable extraction method for the analysis of tps during treatment processes elucidation of the structures of tps is a complex task that requires consideration of many parameters in order to propose the most representative structure section s2 supplementary material shows the results provided by the analytical software for all the tps identified including the experimental and calculated masses protonated molecules the best formula proposed for each m z the error in ppm and dbe double bond equivalence information besides de ms spectra of each tp with the fragments proposed for all the data presented low errors below 5 ppm indicated that the proposed elemental composition was in agreement with the exact experimental mass in order to ensure a reliable fragmentation pattern for each tp collision energies between 20 and 40 ev were applied in broadband collision induced dissociation bbcid acquisition mode the spf degradation of dzp proceeds according to different pathways fig 1 in one of these pathways fig 1a the degradation starts with the reaction of a hydroxy radical with the nch3 group leading to a resonance stabilized radical with an electron donating group further reaction of this radical leads to hydroxylation and formation of tp2 m z 301 0738 which can undergo radical c aryl cleavage to generate tp1 m z 225 0425 or radical n demethylation to form tp5 nordiazepam m z 271 0633 tp5 is known to be a major metabolite of dzp greenblatt et al 1980 and has been identified in different water matrices aymerich et al 2016 lÃ³pez serna et al 2012 wang et al 2017 both dzp and nordiazepam are pharmacologically active compounds greenblatt et al 1981 a second degradation pathway is triggered by the radical hydroxylation of dzp at the Î± carbonyl position generating a radical which is stabilized by resonance with an electron withdrawing group fig 1b the resulting radical is trapped by another hydroxyl radical to yield the highly reactive Î± hydroxy ketone which under oxidative conditions undergoes carbon carbon bond cleavage ultimately leading to formation of the oxidized product tp6 m z 301 0738 finally fig 1c shows the direct oxidation pathway of the sp2 nitrogen of aryl ch bonds resulting in formation of the corresponding n oxide tp3 m z 301 0738 in addition hydroxylation at any of the aromatic ch bonds leads to the formation of tp4 m z 301 0738 which can exist as several oxidized positional isomers for clarity only one is shown although the transformation of dzp to tp5 is very well established the aromatic hydroxylation is not clearly reported in the current literature only a few studies describing the degradation of dzp have tried to elucidate its tps some proposals for tp4 were published by kosjek et al al 2012 and helbling et al al 2010 however these authors were unable to indicate which aromatic ring was hydroxylated since the ms spectra showed common fragments and several isomeric products were possible see section s2 supplementary material other tps proposed here tp1 tp2 tp3 and tp6 have not been previously reported in the literature only one study bautitz et al 2012 reported four structural isomers with m z 301 which could correspond to the addition of one hydroxyl radical in different positions of dzp but no structure was proposed besides all the data provided by the data analysis software another parameter used in proposal of the structures was the log kow of each structure given the use of a nonpolar chromatographic separation column the log kow value should increase with increase of the retention time the proposed structures were in agreement with this parameter since the log kow values predicted by the epi suitekowwin v 1 68 software were 2 82 0 41 1 23 1 70 2 22 2 87 and 3 40 for dzp tp1 tp2 tp3 tp4 tp5 and tp6 respectively 3 2 in silico risk assessment of dzp and its tps the persistence of dzp and its tps was assessed by in silico predictions provided by the biowin models of the epi suite software the predicted values are shown in table s2 section s3 supplementary material fig 2 a shows the biowin 5 miti japanese ministry of international trade and industry biodegradation database predictions for the analyzed compounds since values higher than 0 5 indicate possible biodegradability the predictions suggested that dzp and all the tps were persistent all the tps were predicted to be non readily biodegradable using both the biowin 5 model and the vega irfm model such behavior could be explained according to the generalized rules of thumb for biodegradation where the presence of chlorine in the molecule increases the recalcitrance assessment of the potential mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of dzp and the tps was performed using prometheus software to obtain the pbt values the predicted in silico values are shown in table s3 section s3 supplementary material a total score threshold of 0 5 was used to discriminate non pbt 0 5 and potentially pbt or vpvb 0 5 compounds pizzo et al 2016 fig 2b shows the predicted pbt values for dzp and its tps all the structures were ranked below the threshold value of 0 5 with the exception of tp6 pbt 0 514 however the tps could be pbt compounds considering the uncertainty of the predictions pizzo et al 2016 and the fact that the values were close to the threshold value the results obtained using the vega qsar toolbox and case ultra models for the prediction of carcinogenicity and mutagenicity are summarized in table s4 section s3 supplementary material according to the vega qsar models for mutagenicity ames test consensus a none of the molecules evaluated gave a positive alert the predictions provide a consensus score from 0 to 1 where a score of 1 usually corresponds to structures inside the adi with the presence of the experimental value in at least one of the four consensus models a consensus score below 0 75 indicates structural differences among the predicted compounds with the structures present in the predictive models and the predictions with low consensus scores being classified as having moderate or low reliability in the present case the structures studied were not similar to the models so these results could not be considered reliable the vega carcinogenicity models irfmn antares b caesar c iss d and irfmn isscan cgx e showed no carcinogenicity alerts for dzp with all of the models having experimental values available evaluation of the tps using the different models resulted in no positive alerts with good reliability there were some positive alerts with moderate reliability but divergences were observed between the models so no reliable conclusions could be reached considering the qsar toolbox results no alerts were reported considering dna alerts for ames by oasis a and dna alerts for ca and mnt by oasis b however in vitro mutagenicity ames test alerts by iss c and in vitro mutagenicity micronucleus alerts by iss d identified two types of alerts n methylol derivative alerts for tp1 and tp2 are shown in fig 2c while h acceptor path3 h acceptor alerts found for all the molecules are provided in section s4 supplementary material an aromatic n acyl amine alert was obtained for tp6 case ultra analysis of dzp and the tps was performed using three models i the case ultra gt expert model which identified mutagenicity alerts for tp1 and tp2 due to the n methylol derivative group ii the case ultra gt1 bmut model which identified two more alerts for tp1 while four more alerts were obtained for tp2 in addition to the mutagenicity alerts for tp1 and tp2 due to the n methylol derivative also predicted by qsar toolbox and iii pharm bmut model which identified n methylol derivative alert for tp1 the risk assessment analysis results predicted possible risks of mutagenicity associated with tp1 and tp2 especially due to the n methylol derivative group present in these tps the potential toxicity of this class of compounds is probably associated with the generation of formaldehyde by hydrolysis since formaldehyde is a highly reactive genotoxic agent ashby and tennant 1988 benigni and bossa 2008 these results showed the importance of tps evaluation and the need for a preconcentration extraction method that enables the identification of tps during treatment processes 3 3 dllme method the development of a dllme preconcentration extraction method for the tps generated during dzp degradation started with selection of the best solvent pair ds es nine pairs of solvents were tested and the best response was obtained when acetonitrile was used as ds and chloroform was used as es throughout the optimization of the preconcentration extraction method the analytical response adopted was the summation of the peak areas of dzp and the tps after identifying the best solvent pair for extraction of the tps evaluation was made of the effects of several variables that could influence the extraction efficiency three main variables were selected for investigation i ds volume Âµl ii es volume Âµl and iii ionic strength mol l 1 na2so4 the centrifugation was set at 2000 rpm for 5 min this parameter was not studied since literature studies shows that centrifugation is responsible for the phases separation and should not be much longer once this could lead to a degradation of the analytes ahmad et al 2015 andruch et al 2013 nowak et al 2020 although the ph of the solution during the dispersion process could have an influence on the extraction efficiency the ph was not a variable studied here the ph was set at 5 because slightly acidic conditions favor the photo fenton reaction while ph above 6 can cause iron precipitation cuervo lumbaque et al 2019 a 23 factorial design was used with the three defined variables in order to provide an indication of their effects after analysis of the results a more refined design was applied to obtain the best condition the variable values and the response surface of the 23 factorial design are provided in section s5 supplementary material the results indicated that the extraction was favored at the maximum ds and es volumes although this experimental design did not define an optimum point the ionic strength of the solution in the range studied showed no statistically significant effect on the analytical response and was not considered for the followed design given these results a new experiment was proposed based on a doehlert design to determine the best condition for the extraction of dzp and its tps considering only two variables namely the volumes of ds and es it is important to highlight that to identification of the best conditions for each variable in both experimental designs the desirability function proposed by derringer and suich in 1980 derringer and suich 1980 was used a very usual tool frequently applied in response surface methodology desirability function brings efficiency economy and objectivity in the optimization process bezerra et al 2008 and was applied for different variables and their responses desirability scale ranges between d 0 for a non desirable response value and d 1 for a more desirable value and it was calculated for individual values the desirability function d is calculated by combining the individual desirability values with the geometric mean d d1 d2 dm 1 m ferreira et al 2007 the desirability graphics of each experimental design can be seen in sections s5 and s6 supplementary material fig 3 a shows the different levels of the two variables selected in the doehlert design the ranges tested were 400 1000 Âµl of ds and 100 500 Âµl of es with a total of thirteen experiments further details are provided in section s6 supplementary material the results of the doehlert design experiments were used to construct the response surface graph shown in fig 3b and c according eq 1 1 z 2057159 08 12608 57 x 6 70 x 2 8750 05 y 8 36 y 2 2 38 x y 0 where z dzp area tps area x ds volume and y es volume considering the response only around the experimental conditions blue points the best response was obtained when the maximum values of ds and es were used 1000 Âµl of ds and 500 Âµl of es all the statistical parameters of the doehlert design are shown in section s6 supplementary material the maximum explainable variation of the model was 94 radjusted 0 94 demonstrating that the model presented a good fit enabling prediction of the best extraction condition the maximum predicted response was obtained using around 1000 Âµl of ds and 650 Âµl of es a new experiment was then performed to test the best condition predicted by the model resulting in a difference of 7 9 between the predicted and experimental values consequently the optimized condition for extraction of dzp and its tps was defined as the use of 1000 Âµl of ds and 650 Âµl of es dispersed in 7 5 ml of the sample at ph 5 with centrifugation of the mixture for 5 min at 2000 rpm followed by collection of the lower phase with a microsyringe the extract was evaporated the sample was reconstituted with 500 Âµl of h2o methanol 90 10 v v and analysis was performed by lc qtof ms 3 4 use of dllme for preconcentration extraction of dzp and its tps present in different matrices the method developed to extract dzp and its tps in the spf degradation experiments was applied using three different matrices upw sw and rhw an initial solution of dzp at 500 Âµg l 1 was used in these experiments the spf experimental parameters are provided in fig s18 section s7 supplementary material fig 4 a shows the results for degradation of dzp in the three different matrices obtained using the optimized dllme extraction procedure the analytical response employed was the ratio between the observed and initial dzp concentrations c c0 the analytical curve presented an r2 value of 0 9987 and the limits of detection and quantification were 2 8 and 8 6 Âµg l 1 respectively as expected the nature of the matrix had a significant influence on the degradation process in the upw only dzp was initially present in the solution so the hydroxyl radicals only acted in the degradation of dzp and the tps very fast degradation of dzp was observed in the sw despite the presence of other organic compounds however very slow degradation occurred in the rhw which could be attributed to the highly complex nature of the matrix with the presence of many organic compounds including other pharmaceuticals and human metabolites as reported in a previous study employing rhw becker et al 2020 in the case of rhw the hydroxyl radicals generated during the solar photo fenton process were not selective towards dzp and its tps so competition involving other molecules led to slower degradation of dzp the experimental data for the degradation of dzp at an initial concentration of 500 Âµg l 1 in the different matrices were fitted using a pseudo first order model performed with sigmaplot 10 software systat software usa the degradation of dzp in upw followed pseudo first order kinetics according to eq 2 2 c c 0 e k o b s t where c is the concentration of dzp at time t c0 is the initial concentration of dzp and kobs is the degradation rate constant the half life tÂ½ for dzp degradation was calculated according to eq 3 3 t 1 2 ln 2 k o b s for dzp degradation in upw the value of kobs was 6 07 10 2 min 1 t30w with r2 of 0 9967 p 0 0001 c0 of 1 0064 and a half life time tÂ½ of t30w 11 42 min dzp degradation in sw also followed pseudo first order kinetics with the same equations eqs 2 and 3 the kobs value was 4 93 10 2 min 1 t30w with r2 of 0 9950 p 0 0001 c0 of 1 0080 and a half life time tÂ½ of t30w 14 06 min the degradation of dzp in rhw presented different order kinetics with the process being biphasic langdon et al 2011 in the first stage the degradation followed pseudo first order kinetics while no degradation was observed in the second stage eq 4 this was indicative of the existence of one degradable fraction and another recalcitrant fraction shown by the y intercept y0 4 c c 0 e k o b s t y 0 in eq 4 c is the concentration of dzp at time t c0 is the initial dzp concentration kobs is the degradation rate constant and y0represents the recalcitrant fraction the half life tÂ½ of dzp degradation was calculated according to eq 3 for the degradation of dzp in rhw kobs was 3 09 10 2 min 1 t30w with r2 of 0 9672 p 0 0001 a half life time tÂ½ of t30w 22 43 min and y0 0 5226 after analysis of the degradation of dzp in the different matrices investigation was made of the formation and degradation of the tps fig 4 since the most of tps are new and unknown compounds analytical standards are not available concerning the dpz tps only tp5 a dzp metabolite known as nordiazepam has commercially analytical standard available accordingly no quantitative analysis was developed for the tps and the evaluation of formation and further degradation of tps was based on the ratio between the tp and internal standard pi peak area as analytical response although the values obtained for dzp degradation in upw and sw were very similar the formation and degradation of the tps differed in these two matrices in upw dzp degradation by the spf process resulted in very fast formation of tps with maximum formation of tp2 tp3 tp4 tp5 and tp6 at t30w of 14 7 min after which these tps were considered degraded an exception was tp1 which showed maximum formation at t30w of 29 7 min which was reasonable considering that tp1 was formed by degradation of tp2 after t30w of 118 7 min it is not possible to detect tp3 tp4 tp5 and tp6 while it was possible to detect tp2 and tp1 until t30w of 169 7 and 211 8 min respectively this was of concern since tp1 and tp2 presented mutagenic characteristics and were the most persistent tps in the treatment of the sw there was rapid formation of the tps while their initial degradation rates were slower compared to the upw treatment the formation of tp1 was lower compared to the upw treatment and after t30w of 131 min it was not possible to detect tp1 tp3 tp4 and tp5 after t30w of 193 2 min tp2 and tp6 could still be detected in low amounts while no tps were detectable after t30w of 246 9 min the degradation of dzp in the rhw was significantly slower than in the other matrices which was directly reflected in the formation and degradation of the tps even after t30w of 208 2 min all the tps were identified in the degraded samples during this treatment process it was only possible to detect tp1 after t30w of 208 2 min which could be explained by the fact that there was less formation of tp2 so consequently there was lower formation of tp1 since the latter was formed from tp2 in addition to evaluation of the formation of the tps in the different matrices it was possible to determine the preconcentration factor of the method for these matrices consistent with the effect of the matrix on dzp degradation the preconcentration factor also differed according to the matrix this could be explained by the fact that the extraction was not exclusive for the compounds identified but could also have involved other substances present particularly in the case of a complex real matrix such as rhw considering dzp and all the tps the preconcentration factor values for the upw matrix ranged between 5 9 and 13 for the sw matrix the preconcentration factor values were in the range from 4 3 to 8 6 while for the rhw matrix lower values of between 1 9 and 7 1 were obtained more details are presented in table s12 section 7 supplementary material the importance of preconcentration was shown by the fact that tp1 was not detected in samples analyzed without extraction and preconcentration but could be identified after application of the extraction methods spe and dllme considering the predicted mutagenicity of tp1 as an example it is clearly important that an extraction method should be available for the extraction and concentration of tps during solar photo fenton degradation processes 3 5 time demand and cost evaluation of dllme cost and time evaluations were performed by comparing the dllme technique and a standard spe method described in the literature for extraction of pharmaceuticals and tps hernÃ¡ndez et al 2015 for this comparison the values of consumables solvents and reagents were considered permanent materials such as the manifold used in spe and the microsyringe used in dllme the cost of lc qtof ms analysis the working hours of the analyst and equipment maintenance costs were not considered the results table 1 showed that spe was much more expensive than dllme the cost of spe was us 13 44 per extraction due to the high cost of the extraction cartridge furthermore a long time of 70 min was required for the extraction and resuspension of one sample in the spe procedure in contrast the dllme method presented a cost of us 0 43 and a time requirement of 15 min per sample extraction the development of an accessible preconcentration methodology is very important since it allows analyses to be readily performed during a degradation process without concern about additional cost implications enabling significant improvement in the ability to detect and identify tps 4 conclusions in this work it was possible to elucidate six transformation products generated during spf degradation of dzp four of which had not been reported previously in the literature in risk assessment of the tps two of the compounds tp1 and tp2 presented mutagenicity alerts indicating that they could present a greater environmental risk compared to the parent compound this demonstrated the need to understand the mechanisms of dzp degradation as well as to use an effective method capable of degrading both dzp and its tps especially given that dzp is considered a recalcitrant compound the proposed dllme method for extraction and preconcentration of dzp and its tps was shown to be fast cheap and simple its use enabled the elucidation of a tp that could not be detected without preconcentration when the spf treatment was performed in upw the proposed dllme method provided a preconcentration rate that was very similar to that of spe when the spf treatment was performed in rhw the dllme method showed a lower preconcentration efficiency compared to spe but nonetheless achieved the same goal since it succeeded in extracting preconcentrating all the tps also found by the spe method in terms of the cost and time of the method dllme was much cheaper and faster than spe with a significant reduction of the quantity of solvents used in the process declaration of competing interest he authors declare that

17699,this work evaluated the formation of transformation products tps during the degradation of diazepam dzp by a solar photo fenton process six tps were identified three of them for the first time after elucidation of the tps a new cheap fast and easy method was employed to extract and preconcentrate dzp and its tps using dispersive liquid liquid microextraction dllme the method was optimized using factorial and doehlert designs with the best results obtained using acetonitrile as disperser solvent and chloroform as extraction solvent with volumes of 1000 and 650 Âµl respectively when dzp degradation was performed in ultrapure water the extraction preconcentration of dzp and its tps by dllme was very similar to the results obtained using a traditional spe method however when hospital wastewater was used as the matrix more limited extraction efficiency was obtained using dllme compared to spe meanwhile all the tps extracted by spe were also extracted by the dllme technique furthermore dllme was much less expensive than spe besides being faster easier and requiring only small amounts of organic solvents this work reports a new and very important tool for the extraction and preconcentration of tps formed during degradation using techniques such as advanced oxidation processes aops since without this step it would not be possible to identify all the tps formed in some complex wastewater matrices graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords advanced oxidation processes pathway extraction technique doehlert optimization in silico risk assessment 1 introduction neurological disorders such as epilepsy among others are some of the most important classes of diseases affecting the global population the treatment of these illnesses frequently involves the prescription of benzodiazepines with diazepam dzp being one of the most important of these compounds dzp has anticonvulsant anxiolytic sedative and muscle relaxant properties dudley et al 2019 sulaiman 2017 it has been estimated that following ingestion 5 50 of the dzp dose is excreted unchanged consequently entering the environment west and rowland 2012 in a previous study becker et al 2020 reported that dzp is commonly found in hospital wastewater rhw in aquatic environments dzp has been detected in a wide range of concentrations ranging from 20 ng l 1 river water to 600 ng l 1 hospital wastewater almeida et al 2015 khan et al 2018 the widespread global consumption of dzp and its constant release into the environment have stimulated studies of the degradation of this pharmaceutical conventional wastewater treatments are unable to completely eliminate this type of compound so the development and application of advanced oxidation processes aops may offer a solution since they can provide highly effective and rapid degradation of organic compounds bosio et al 2019 the efficiency of aops is due to the formation of hydroxyl radicals ho which are highly oxidizing very reactive and non selective bautitz and nogueira 2010 the degradation of dzp has been studied using different aops including heterogeneous photocatalysis bosio et al 2019 sulaiman 2017 and the heterogeneous photo fenton process valcÃ¡rcel et al 2012 although these processes are attractive options for use in dzp degradation they employ artificial sources of uv irradiation as a more environmentally friendly approach the use of solar radiation can considerably reduce the cost of the treatment making the solar photo fenton spf process one of the most economic and efficient techniques bautitz and nogueira 2010 gimÃ©nez et al 2015 the use of the spf process for degradation of dzp has been shown to be a viable option bautitz and nogueira 2010 cuervo lumbaque et al 2019 despite dzp being considered a recalcitrant compound banaschik et al 2018 kosjek et al 2012 nonetheless it is very important to investigate the formation of transformation products tps that may be more toxic than the parent compound lambropoulou and nollet 2014 postigo and richardson 2014 evaluation of the formation of tps requires sensitive techniques such as uhplc qtof ms for their identification using exact masses since commercial standards are not usually available in addition predictions of toxicity biodegradability mutagenicity and carcinogenicity provide valuable information about tps for this purpose computational methods such as qsar quantitative structure activity relationships vega and epi suite among other methodologies are increasingly used for assessment of the environmental risk of different compounds including tps della flora et al 2020 jentzsch et al 2016 westphal et al 2020 yuval et al 2017 it is important to be able to detect the maximum possible number of tps formed during a degradation process because sometimes the less abundant tp could be the most toxic mutagenic carcinogenic intermediate to do this it is necessary to use methodologies for the extraction and preconcentration of the tps formed since they may be present at very low concentrations currently solid phase extraction spe is the technique most widely used for this purpose campos maÃ±as et al 2019 senta et al 2019 however although this methodology is very efficient and a large number of different solid phase extractants are commercially available it requires large volumes of solvents and can involve lengthy procedures as an alternative microextraction using dispersive liquid liquid microextraction dllme is very fast simple environmentally friendly and less expensive this technique which was proposed in 2006 rezaee et al 2006 uses only a few microliters of extraction and disperser solvents and can be applied for different organic compounds present in a variety of matrices carasek et al 2018 the present work has two aspects firstly identification was made of the tps formed during an spf process for the degradation of dzp together with a predictive risk assessment of these compounds secondly an optimized methodology for the extraction of dzp and its tps by dllme was developed which was applied for the spf degradation of dzp in three different aqueous matrices ultrapure water upw simulated wastewater sw and raw hospital wastewater rhw 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals diazepam 98 and diazepam d5 sigma aldrich usa were

collision energy variation from 20 ev to 40 ev ms ms all data were processed using dataanalysis 4 2 software and targetanalysis 1 3 both from brukerdaltonics 2 3 primary elimination of diazepam and tps identification the spf process for the degradation of dzp prior to identification of the tps was carried out using a solar batch photoreactor 1 l equipped with a magnetic stirrer before the experiments the initial ph of the dzp solution was adjusted to 5 0 using h2so4 0 05 mol l 1 after initial tests this ph was selected because use of the classical photo fenton ph 2 8 3 0 bassam et al 2012 would imply higher reagent consumption for acidification of the medium after ph adjustment addition was made of 5 mg l 1 fe2 using a 10 g l 1 fe2 stock solution and hydrogen peroxide at an initial concentration of 50 mg l 1 using a 35 w v solution in this order followed by exposure to solar radiation for initiation of the treatment process the solar uv radiation was measured with a solar energy meter sp 2000 icel which provided data in terms of incident uv w m 2 these data were used to calculate the t30w values nogueira et al 2005 an initial solution of dzp at a concentration of 1000 Î¼g l 1 prepared in ultrapure water upw was used to identify tps formed during the degradation process subsequently different water matrices and initial dzp concentrations were employed in the experimental assays detailed in section 2 7 the reaction time was initially obtained as the clock time with subsequent transformation to t30w after the experiment during the treatment process eight samples were collected at different times filtered using a 0 22 Âµm pvdf syringe filter and analyzed by lc qtof ms to identify the formation of possible tps considering the appearance of new chromatographic peaks during the process data from the tp analyses were processed using data analysis 4 2 software selecting the elemental composition and double bond equivalency dbe options in most cases possible elemental compositions for the ions were assigned with a maximum error of 5 ppm after the identification of tps a dzp degradation pathway was proposed 2 4 in silico quantitative structure activity relationship qsar models used for prediction and risk assessment the structure of the dzp and its tps were transformed into smiles strings by means of chembiodraw ultra v 12 and subjected to in silico predictions by freely available and different software and models the log kow and log bcf values were predicted by epi suite kowwin v1 68 and bcfbaf v3 01 programs respectively the persistence and biodegradability were predicted by epi suite biowin v4 10 the predicted ready biodegradability of the combined biowin 1 7 models boethling and costanza 2010 pavan and worth 2008 is pointed out as yes or no based on the following criteria yes if the biowin 3 result is weeks days or days to weeks and in the case of biowin 5 the probability is 0 5 if these criteria were not met the prediction is no us epa 2012 the prometheus software pizzo et al 2016 was used for predicting and ranking the dzp and tps depending on its persistence p bioaccumulation b and toxicity t i e pbt compounds for the hazard assessment according to registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach reach commission regulation 2011 moreover the mutagenicity activity was predicted by means of vega qsar v 1 1 4 software benfenati et al 2013 and case ultra chakravarti et al 2012 saiakhov et al 2014 2013 a consensus approach was used by applying the mutagenicity ames test consensus model v1 0 2 it performs an analysis among the caesar model v 2 1 13 iss model v 1 0 2 knn read across model v 1 0 0 and sarpy irfmn model v 1 0 7 to predict the mutagenicity by a

that there are differences in the target compound compared to the similar one found in the database case ultra modes gt expert gt1 bmut and pharma mut statistical and ruled based system according to ich m7 guidelines for mutagenicity was applied as well ich 2017 2 5 analytical measurements during the spf treatment process during all the spf treatments the total iron and hydrogen peroxide concentrations were monitored the total iron content was determined by a colorimetric method employing 1 10 phenanthroline according to iso 1988 using a cary 50 uv vis spectrophotometer hydrogen peroxide was determined by a spectrophotometric method employing ammonium metavanadate nogueira et al 2005 2 6 dllme method preconcentration using the dllme technique was performed to improve the detection of tps during dzp degradation in preliminary tests the best combination of extraction solvent es and disperser solvent ds was selected for maximizing analyte extraction efficiency for this nine es ds pairs were evaluated chloroform acetonitrile chloroform methanol chloroform ethanol trichloroethylene acetonitrile trichloroethylene methanol trichloroethylene ethanol dichloromethane acetonitrile dichloromethane methanol and dichloromethane ethanol in these tests a spf degradation process was performed under the same conditions as the experiment for identification of the tps with treatment for 120 min the volumes of es and ds were initially set at 100 and 400 Î¼l respectively a 7 5 ml aliquot of the sample was transferred to a glass centrifugation tube with a conical base the solvent mixture was rapidly dispersed in the sample resulting in the instantaneous formation of an emulsion microdrops the emulsion was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min after which the organic phase was removed using a microsyringe and transferred to a 2 ml chromatography vial the solvent was evaporated under a gentle stream of nitrogen and the extract was reconstituted with 500 Âµl of water methanol 90 10 v v prior to analysis using uhplc qtof ms the ds es combination that provided the best extraction of dzp and its tps was selected and a 23 factorial design with a central point was used to evaluate the effects of the ds and es volumes as well as the ionic strength na2so4 concentration an optimization of the experimental dllme conditions was then performed according to a doehlert design with the volumes of ds and es as the variables 2 7 dllme method for extraction of tps in different matrices the optimized dllme variables for extraction of the tps were tested in new spf assays performed using the different matrices upw sw and rhw under the same spf conditions described above but with an initial dzp concentration of 500 Âµg l 1 the sw composition was adapted from oecd oecd 2001 simulating the organic content of real hospital wastewater as follows 160 mg l 1 of peptone 110 mg l 1 of beef extract 30 mg l 1 of urea 2 mg l 1 of mg2so4 7h2o and 4 mg l 1 of cacl2 2h2o for the analysis using rhw a sample of wastewater was collected at a hospital in the city of porto alegre rio grande do sul brazil all the degradation experiments using the different matrices were carried out in duplicate 2 8 cost and time evaluation of the dllme technique the cost and time requirements of the dllme method were obtained considering the value of the reagents and the extraction time and were compared to a standard spe method hernÃ¡ndez et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 elucidation of proposed transformation products since tps may be generated in low concentrations during a degradation process an initial experiment was performed to identify the tps using a solution of dzp at 1000 Âµg l 1 in upw without application of any extraction or preconcentration method before addition of ferrous iron and hydrogen peroxide the ph of the solution was adjusted to 5 the spf process was carried out for 120 min with aliquots collected at 0 15 30 45 60 90 and 120 min in order to stop the degradation process the hydrogen peroxide was quenched with excess of sodium bisulfite the results obtained for the total iron concentration hydrogen peroxide consumption and dzp degradation are provided in section s1 supplementary material after the spf process the collected samples were filtered and analyzed by lc qtof ms for identification of possible tps based on the appearance of new chromatographic peaks this resulted in the identification of five proposed tps tp1 tp5 after optimization of the dllme process section 3 3 additional samples were collected for lc qtof ms analyses in order to discover any possible tps that had not been identified in the first experiment but were detectable after sample preconcentration by dllme this resulted in the identification and proposal of another new tp tp6 showing the importance of using a suitable extraction method for the analysis of tps during treatment processes elucidation of the structures of tps is a complex task that requires consideration of many parameters in order to propose the most representative structure section s2 supplementary material shows the results provided by the analytical software for all the tps identified including the experimental and calculated masses protonated molecules the best formula proposed for each m z the error in ppm and dbe double bond equivalence information besides de ms spectra of each tp with the fragments proposed for all the data presented low errors below 5 ppm indicated that the proposed elemental composition was in agreement with the exact experimental mass in order to ensure a reliable fragmentation pattern for each tp collision energies between 20 and 40 ev were applied in broadband collision induced dissociation bbcid acquisition mode the spf degradation of dzp proceeds according to different pathways fig 1 in one of these pathways fig 1a the degradation starts with the reaction of a hydroxy radical with the nch3 group leading to a resonance stabilized radical with an electron donating group further reaction of this radical leads to hydroxylation and formation of tp2 m z 301 0738 which can undergo radical c aryl cleavage to generate tp1 m z 225 0425 or radical n demethylation to form tp5 nordiazepam m z 271 0633 tp5 is known to be a major metabolite of dzp greenblatt et al 1980 and has been identified in different water matrices aymerich et al 2016 lÃ³pez serna et al 2012 wang et al 2017 both dzp and nordiazepam are pharmacologically active compounds greenblatt et al 1981 a second degradation pathway is triggered by the radical hydroxylation of dzp at the Î± carbonyl position generating a radical which is stabilized by resonance with an electron withdrawing group fig 1b the resulting radical is trapped by another hydroxyl radical to yield the highly reactive Î± hydroxy ketone which under oxidative conditions undergoes carbon carbon bond cleavage ultimately leading to formation of the oxidized product tp6 m z 301 0738 finally fig 1c shows the direct oxidation pathway of the sp2 nitrogen of aryl ch bonds resulting in formation of the corresponding n oxide tp3 m z 301 0738 in addition hydroxylation at any of the aromatic ch bonds leads to the formation of tp4 m z 301 0738 which can exist as several oxidized positional isomers for clarity only one is shown although the transformation of dzp to tp5 is very well established the aromatic hydroxylation is not clearly reported in the current literature only a few studies describing the degradation of dzp have tried to elucidate its tps some proposals for tp4 were published by kosjek et al al 2012 and helbling et al al 2010 however these authors were unable to indicate which aromatic ring was hydroxylated since the ms spectra showed common fragments and several isomeric products were possible see section s2 supplementary material other tps proposed here tp1 tp2 tp3 and tp6 have not been previously reported in the literature only one study bautitz et al 2012 reported four structural isomers with m z 301 which could correspond to the addition of one hydroxyl radical in different positions of dzp but no structure was proposed besides all the data provided by the data analysis software another parameter used in proposal of the structures was the log kow of each structure given the use of a nonpolar chromatographic separation column the log kow value should increase with increase of the retention time the proposed structures were in agreement with this parameter since the log kow values predicted by the epi suitekowwin v 1 68 software were 2 82 0 41 1 23 1 70 2 22 2 87 and 3 40 for dzp tp1 tp2 tp3 tp4 tp5 and tp6 respectively 3 2 in silico risk assessment of dzp and its tps the persistence of dzp and its tps was assessed by in silico predictions provided by the biowin models of the epi suite software the predicted values are shown in table s2 section s3 supplementary material fig 2 a shows the biowin 5 miti japanese ministry of international trade and industry biodegradation database predictions for the analyzed compounds since values higher than 0 5 indicate possible biodegradability the predictions suggested that dzp and all the tps were persistent all the tps were predicted to be non readily biodegradable using both the biowin 5 model and the vega irfm model such behavior could be explained according to the generalized rules of thumb for biodegradation where the presence of chlorine in the molecule increases the recalcitrance assessment of the potential mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of dzp and the tps was performed using prometheus software to obtain the pbt values the predicted in silico values are shown in table s3 section s3 supplementary material a total score threshold of 0 5 was used to discriminate non pbt 0 5 and potentially pbt or vpvb 0 5 compounds pizzo et al 2016 fig 2b shows the predicted pbt values for dzp and its tps all the structures were ranked below the threshold value of 0 5 with the exception of tp6 pbt 0 514 however the tps could be pbt compounds considering the uncertainty of the predictions pizzo et al 2016 and the fact that the values were close to the threshold value the results obtained using the vega qsar toolbox and case ultra models for the prediction of carcinogenicity and mutagenicity are summarized in table s4 section s3 supplementary material according to the vega qsar models for mutagenicity ames test consensus a none of the molecules evaluated gave a positive alert the predictions provide a consensus score from 0 to 1 where a score of 1 usually corresponds to structures inside the adi with the presence of the experimental value in at least one of the four consensus models a consensus score below 0 75 indicates structural differences among the predicted compounds with the structures present in the predictive models and the predictions with low consensus scores being classified as having moderate or low reliability in the present case the structures studied were not similar to the models so these results could not be considered reliable the vega carcinogenicity models irfmn antares b caesar c iss d and irfmn isscan cgx e showed no carcinogenicity alerts for dzp with all of the models having experimental values available evaluation of the tps using the different models resulted in no positive alerts with good reliability there were some positive alerts with moderate reliability but divergences were observed between the models so no reliable conclusions could be reached considering the qsar toolbox results no alerts were reported considering dna alerts for ames by oasis a and dna alerts for ca and mnt by oasis b however in vitro mutagenicity ames test alerts by iss c and in vitro mutagenicity micronucleus alerts by iss d identified two types of alerts n methylol derivative alerts for tp1 and tp2 are shown in fig 2c while h acceptor path3 h acceptor alerts found for all the molecules are provided in section s4 supplementary material an aromatic n acyl amine alert was obtained for tp6 case ultra analysis of dzp and the tps was performed using three models i the case ultra gt expert model which identified mutagenicity alerts for tp1 and tp2 due to the n methylol derivative group ii the case ultra gt1 bmut model which identified two more alerts for tp1 while four more alerts were obtained for tp2 in addition to the mutagenicity alerts for tp1 and tp2 due to the n methylol derivative also predicted by qsar toolbox and iii pharm bmut model which identified n methylol derivative alert for tp1 the risk assessment analysis results predicted possible risks of mutagenicity associated with tp1 and tp2 especially due to the n methylol derivative group present in these tps the potential toxicity of this class of compounds is probably associated with the generation of formaldehyde by hydrolysis since formaldehyde is a highly reactive genotoxic agent ashby and tennant 1988 benigni and bossa 2008 these results showed the importance of tps evaluation and the need for a preconcentration extraction method that enables the identification of tps during treatment processes 3 3 dllme method the development of a dllme preconcentration extraction method for the tps generated during dzp degradation started with selection of the best solvent pair ds es nine pairs of solvents were tested and the best response was obtained when acetonitrile was used as ds and chloroform was used as es throughout the optimization of the preconcentration extraction method the analytical response adopted was the summation of the peak areas of dzp and the tps after identifying the best solvent pair for extraction of the tps evaluation was made of the effects of several variables that could influence the extraction efficiency three main variables were selected for investigation i ds volume Âµl ii es volume Âµl and iii ionic strength mol l 1 na2so4 the centrifugation was set at 2000 rpm for 5 min this parameter was not studied since literature studies shows that centrifugation is responsible for the phases separation and should not be much longer once this could lead to a degradation of the analytes ahmad et al 2015 andruch et al 2013 nowak et al 2020 although the ph of the solution during the dispersion process could have an influence on the extraction efficiency the ph was not a variable studied here the ph was set at 5 because slightly acidic conditions favor the photo fenton reaction while ph above 6 can cause iron precipitation cuervo lumbaque et al 2019 a 23 factorial design was used with the three defined variables in order to provide an indication of their effects after analysis of the results a more refined design was applied to obtain the best condition the variable values and the response surface of the 23 factorial design are provided in section s5 supplementary material the results indicated that the extraction was favored at the maximum ds and es volumes although this experimental design did not define an optimum point the ionic strength of the solution in the range studied showed no statistically significant effect on the analytical response and was not considered for the followed design given these results a new experiment was proposed based on a doehlert design to determine the best condition for the extraction of dzp and its tps considering only two variables namely the volumes of ds and es it is important to highlight that to identification of the best conditions for each variable in both experimental designs the desirability function proposed by derringer and suich in 1980 derringer and suich 1980 was used a very usual tool frequently applied in response surface methodology desirability function brings efficiency economy and objectivity in the optimization process bezerra et al 2008 and was applied for different variables and their responses desirability scale ranges between d 0 for a non desirable response value and d 1 for a more desirable value and it was calculated for individual values the desirability function d is calculated by combining the individual desirability values with the geometric mean d d1 d2 dm 1 m ferreira et al 2007 the desirability graphics of each experimental design can be seen in sections s5 and s6 supplementary material fig 3 a shows the different levels of the two variables selected in the doehlert design the ranges tested were 400 1000 Âµl of ds and 100 500 Âµl of es with a total of thirteen experiments further details are provided in section s6 supplementary material the results of the doehlert design experiments were used to construct the response surface graph shown in fig 3b and c according eq 1 1 z 2057159 08 12608 57 x 6 70 x 2 8750 05 y 8 36 y 2 2 38 x y 0 where z dzp area tps area x ds volume and y es volume considering the response only around the experimental conditions blue points the best response was obtained when the maximum values of ds and es were used 1000 Âµl of ds and 500 Âµl of es all the statistical parameters of the doehlert design are shown in section s6 supplementary material the maximum explainable variation of the model was 94 radjusted 0 94 demonstrating that the model presented a good fit enabling prediction of the best extraction condition the maximum predicted response was obtained using around 1000 Âµl of ds and 650 Âµl of es a new experiment was then performed to test the best condition predicted by the model resulting in a difference of 7 9 between the predicted and experimental values consequently the optimized condition for extraction of dzp and its tps was defined as the use of 1000 Âµl of ds and 650 Âµl of es dispersed in 7 5 ml of the sample at ph 5 with centrifugation of the mixture for 5 min at 2000 rpm followed by collection of the lower phase with a microsyringe the extract was evaporated the sample was reconstituted with 500 Âµl of h2o methanol 90 10 v v and analysis was performed by lc qtof ms 3 4 use of dllme for preconcentration extraction of dzp and its tps present in different matrices the method developed to extract dzp and its tps in the spf degradation experiments was applied using three different matrices upw sw and rhw an initial solution of dzp at 500 Âµg l 1 was used in these experiments the spf experimental parameters are provided in fig s18 section s7 supplementary material fig 4 a shows the results for degradation of dzp in the three different matrices obtained using the optimized dllme extraction procedure the analytical response employed was the ratio between the observed and initial dzp concentrations c c0 the analytical curve presented an r2 value of 0 9987 and the limits of detection and quantification were 2 8 and 8 6 Âµg l 1 respectively as expected the nature of the matrix had a significant influence on the degradation process in the upw only dzp was initially present in the solution so the hydroxyl radicals only acted in the degradation of dzp and the tps very fast degradation of dzp was observed in the sw despite the presence of other organic compounds however very slow degradation occurred in the rhw which could be attributed to the highly complex nature of the matrix with the presence of many organic compounds including other pharmaceuticals and human metabolites as reported in a previous study employing rhw becker et al 2020 in the case of rhw the hydroxyl radicals generated during the solar photo fenton process were not selective towards dzp and its tps so competition involving other molecules led to slower degradation of dzp the experimental data for the degradation of dzp at an initial concentration of 500 Âµg l 1 in the different matrices were fitted using a pseudo first order model performed with sigmaplot 10 software systat software usa the degradation of dzp in upw followed pseudo first order kinetics according to eq 2 2 c c 0 e k o b s t where c is the concentration of dzp at time t c0 is the initial concentration of dzp and kobs is the degradation rate constant the half life tÂ½ for dzp degradation was calculated according to eq 3 3 t 1 2 ln 2 k o b s for dzp degradation in upw the value of kobs was 6 07 10 2 min 1 t30w with r2 of 0 9967 p 0 0001 c0 of 1 0064 and a half life time tÂ½ of t30w 11 42 min dzp degradation in sw also followed pseudo first order kinetics with the same equations eqs 2 and 3 the kobs value was 4 93 10 2 min 1 t30w with r2 of 0 9950 p 0 0001 c0 of 1 0080 and a half life time tÂ½ of t30w 14 06 min the degradation of dzp in rhw presented different order kinetics with the process being biphasic langdon et al 2011 in the first stage the degradation followed pseudo first order kinetics while no degradation was observed in the second stage eq 4 this was indicative of the existence of one degradable fraction and another recalcitrant fraction shown by the y intercept y0 4 c c 0 e k o b s t y 0 in eq 4 c is the concentration of dzp at time t c0 is the initial dzp concentration kobs is the degradation rate constant and y0represents the recalcitrant fraction the half life tÂ½ of dzp degradation was calculated according to eq 3 for the degradation of dzp in rhw kobs was 3 09 10 2 min 1 t30w with r2 of 0 9672 p 0 0001 a half life time tÂ½ of t30w 22 43 min and y0 0 5226 after analysis of the degradation of dzp in the different matrices investigation was made of the formation and degradation of the tps fig 4 since the most of tps are new and unknown compounds analytical standards are not available concerning the dpz tps only tp5 a dzp metabolite known as nordiazepam has commercially analytical standard available accordingly no quantitative analysis was developed for the tps and the evaluation of formation and further degradation of tps was based on the ratio between the tp and internal standard pi peak area as analytical response although the values obtained for dzp degradation in upw and sw were very similar the formation and degradation of the tps differed in these two matrices in upw dzp degradation by the spf process resulted in very fast formation of tps with maximum formation of tp2 tp3 tp4 tp5 and tp6 at t30w of 14 7 min after which these tps were considered degraded an exception was tp1 which showed maximum formation at t30w of 29 7 min which was reasonable considering that tp1 was formed by degradation of tp2 after t30w of 118 7 min it is not possible to detect tp3 tp4 tp5 and tp6 while it was possible to detect tp2 and tp1 until t30w of 169 7 and 211 8 min respectively this was of concern since tp1 and tp2 presented mutagenic characteristics and were the most persistent tps in the treatment of the sw there was rapid formation of the tps while their initial degradation rates were slower compared to the upw treatment the formation of tp1 was lower compared to the upw treatment and after t30w of 131 min it was not possible to detect tp1 tp3 tp4 and tp5 after t30w of 193 2 min tp2 and tp6 could still be detected in low amounts while no tps were detectable after t30w of 246 9 min the degradation of dzp in the rhw was significantly slower than in the other matrices which was directly reflected in the formation and degradation of the tps even after t30w of 208 2 min all the tps were identified in the degraded samples during this treatment process it was only possible to detect tp1 after t30w of 208 2 min which could be explained by the fact that there was less formation of tp2 so consequently there was lower formation of tp1 since the latter was formed from tp2 in addition to evaluation of the formation of the tps in the different matrices it was possible to determine the preconcentration factor of the method for these matrices consistent with the effect of the matrix on dzp degradation the preconcentration factor also differed according to the matrix this could be explained by the fact that the extraction was not exclusive for the compounds identified but could also have involved other substances present particularly in the case of a complex real matrix such as rhw considering dzp and all the tps the preconcentration factor values for the upw matrix ranged between 5 9 and 13 for the sw matrix the preconcentration factor values were in the range from 4 3 to 8 6 while for the rhw matrix lower values of between 1 9 and 7 1 were obtained more details are presented in table s12 section 7 supplementary material the importance of preconcentration was shown by the fact that tp1 was not detected in samples analyzed without extraction and preconcentration but could be identified after application of the extraction methods spe and dllme considering the predicted mutagenicity of tp1 as an example it is clearly important that an extraction method should be available for the extraction and concentration of tps during solar photo fenton degradation processes 3 5 time demand and cost evaluation of dllme cost and time evaluations were performed by comparing the dllme technique and a standard spe method described in the literature for extraction of pharmaceuticals and tps hernÃ¡ndez et al 2015 for this comparison the values of consumables solvents and reagents were considered permanent materials such as the manifold used in spe and the microsyringe used in dllme the cost of lc qtof ms analysis the working hours of the analyst and equipment maintenance costs were not considered the results table 1 showed that spe was much more expensive than dllme the cost of spe was us 13 44 per extraction due to the high cost of the extraction cartridge furthermore a long time of 70 min was required for the extraction and resuspension of one sample in the spe procedure in contrast the dllme method presented a cost of us 0 43 and a time requirement of 15 min per sample extraction the development of an accessible preconcentration methodology is very important since it allows analyses to be readily performed during a degradation process without concern about additional cost implications enabling significant improvement in the ability to detect and identify tps 4 conclusions in this work it was possible to elucidate six transformation products generated during spf degradation of dzp four of which had not been reported previously in the literature in risk assessment of the tps two of the compounds tp1 and tp2 presented mutagenicity alerts indicating that they could present a greater environmental risk compared to the parent compound this demonstrated the need to understand the mechanisms of dzp degradation as well as to use an effective method capable of degrading both dzp and its tps especially given that dzp is considered a recalcitrant compound the proposed dllme method for extraction and preconcentration of dzp and its tps was shown to be fast cheap and simple its use enabled the elucidation of a tp that could not be detected without preconcentration when the spf treatment was performed in upw the proposed dllme method provided a preconcentration rate that was very similar to that of spe when the spf treatment was performed in rhw the dllme method showed a lower preconcentration efficiency compared to spe but nonetheless achieved the same goal since it succeeded in extracting preconcentrating all the tps also found by the spe method in terms of the cost and time of the method dllme was much cheaper and faster than spe with a significant reduction of the quantity of solvents used in the process declaration of competing interest he authors declare that
