700,the purpose of this study is to ascertain whether the changes in extreme hydrologic time series can be attributed to the reservoir operations by using nonstationary flood frequency analyses on the basis of the reservoir index ri a modified reservoir index mri was put forward and used as a covariate to represent the effects of reservoirs on extreme flows using the generalized additive model for location scale and shape gamlss nonstationary flood frequency models were developed with the mri covariate the models were applied to fit the annual maximum daily flow amdf from 1956 to 2013 at boluo the control gauge station of the dongjiang river djr basin which is strongly influenced by reservoirs in addition to avoid the potential impacts of climatic variability on extreme flows a precipitation covariate that characterizes the key climatological properties is taken into account in the nonstationary flood frequency models the results show that the mri is superior to the ri to reflect the effects of reservoirs on the extreme flows which is more effective and practical and it is a significant explanatory variable for the extreme flows in the nonstationary modeling a significant effect of the reservoirs on the extreme flows is detected with the mri and this effect is greater than the precipitation effect in addition with the increasing demand for water resources and the transformation of reservoir functions the effects of the reservoirs on extreme flows in the djr basin will further increase keywords extreme flows nonstationarity flood frequency analysis modified reservoir index effects of the reservoirs the dongjiang river basin 1 introduction the hypothesis of stationarity is the cornerstone of traditional flood frequency analysis and is based on the assumption that the factors affecting the hydrological variables do not change over time um et al 2017 serago et al 2018 however under the influences of climate change and anthropogenic activities the factors affecting the hydrological variables have been altered resulting in the absence of stationarity in hydrological time series khaliq et al 2006 chen et al 2013 tang et al 2017 milly et al 2008 pointed out that future water resource risk assessments would face great challenges in such a changing environment for example gilroy et al 2011 determined that a 30 2 increase in the 100 yr flood would occur in 2100 in the little patuxent river in guilford in maryland when considering the influences of climate change and human activities thus the influences of these external factors on the flood frequency analysis should be taken into account as a result of the increased focus on nonstationary flood frequency analysis myriad approaches for the frequency analysis of nonstationary hydrological time series have been developed in the past decades e g strupczewski et al 2001 cunderlik and burn 2003 khaliq et al 2006 villarini et al 2009 salas et al 2012 bayazit et al 2015 yan et al 2017 despite an increased emphasis on nonstationarity hydrologists still have great doubts about the design values of the proposed methods on account of the drawbacks of the methods and the lack of effective means of testing the assumptions stedinger and griffis 2011 read and vogel 2015 salas et al 2018 for example the design value with a specific exceedance probability under nonstationary conditions is no longer a constant as that under stationary conditions but a set of values that varies over time therefore montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 pointed out that an elaborate model selection analysis should be implemented prior to the selection of a nonstationary model because a nonstationary model may turn out to be less efficient than a stationary model in view of the increased uncertainty before switching to a fully nonstationary modeling paradigm much research is required in further studies montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 also emphasized that scientific evidence should be provided so that the changes in hydrological time series can be detected if the changes in the hydrological time series have been identified the causes of such changes i e an understanding of the drivers of the detected changes should be investigated merz et al 2012 prosdocimi et al 2015 in recent years researchers have begun to take into account the effects of climate variability e g global warming and human activities e g construction of dams irrigation of crops urbanization on hydrological extreme events in nonstationary analysis e g villarini et al 2009 gilroy et al 2011 lópez and francés 2013 zhang et al 2015 gao et al 2016 collet et al 2017 collet et al 2017 evaluated the effects of climate change on extreme flows and detected a remarkable increase in the 100 yr precipitation in the eastern uk villarini et al 2009 used the generalized additive model for location scale and shape gamlss and developed a nonstationary flood frequency analysis framework to fit the annual maximum peak discharge records in little sugar creek a highly urbanized watershed the results showed that the nonstationary models based on the gamlss framework were able to describe the variability in the mean and variance of the annual maximum peak discharge and exhibited the impacts of urbanization on flood events prosdocimi et al 2015 further investigated the effects of urbanization on extreme flows and found that long term changes in the observed series of high flows could be attributed to changes in land use via nonstationary flood frequency analyses these studies demonstrated that climate change and human activities had great impacts on the extreme events the effects of reservoirs on catchment hydrology processes have been acknowledged for several decades worldwide at least conceptually knighton et al 1988 graf et al 1999 payan et al 2008 liu et al 2010 zhao et al 2012 lópez and francés 2013 li et al 2015a 2015b these studies showed that the effects of reservoirs especially reservoirs with large capacities have greatly impacted the catchment hydrology processes e g runoff and that these effects are one of the causes for the violation of the stationarity of hydrological time series the dongjiang river djr is the second longest tributary of the pearl river to meet the demand of water resources for agricultural irrigation flood control and water supply in the downstream djr basin a number of reservoirs have been built since the 1950s up to 2006 896 reservoirs have been constructed with a total capacity of 190 108 m³ zhang et al 2015 the construction of the reservoirs has greatly influenced the hydrologic processes in this basin wang et al 2008 liu et al 2010 tu et al 2012 ye et al 2013 for example an apparent downward trend of the extreme flows in the djr basin was detected by liu et al 2010 and ye et al 2013 and the construction of water conservancy projects e g reservoirs was one of the main causes for the decline in the extreme flows in addition the djr basin is a region with high flood hazard risks and suffers serious damage from flood hazard wang et al 2015 the investigation of the effect of reservoirs on runoff processes will contribute to the understanding of the driver factors for the nonstationarity of flood which helps to the flood control and countermeasures making the key point to investigate the effects of reservoirs on runoff processes is to quantify the effects by taking into account the regulation strategies it is common that the effects of reservoirs on the hydrological processes are analyzed based on the change in the runoff before and after the construction of reservoirs or by using simulation results of hydrological models in recent years many studies have investigated the effects of reservoirs on the extreme flows based on the nonstationary flood frequency analysis with an index to represent the impacts of reservoir lópez and francés 2013 li et al 2015a 2015b zhang et al 2015 the index used in these studies is on the basis of the reservoir index ri proposed by lópez and francés 2013 by adopting it directly or in a modified way as a covariate the ri can be taken into account in nonstationary models to investigate the impacts of reservoirs on flood regimes however all the variables in an ri series are constants in a specific period this results in a constant ri regardless of the reservoir regulation strategies li et al 2015a the other reservoir indices e g the check dam index are much more complicated and need varied data e g the check dam index needs land use rainstorm and flood data which may result in the limitation of application in addition the significance of the reservoir indices is yet to be tested considering the drawbacks of the present reservoir indices a simpler and more practical reservoir index that takes into account the regulation strategies called modified reservoir index mri hereinafter is proposed in this study see section 2 3 2 and used as a covariate in the nonstationary models to assess the effects of reservoirs on extreme flows the main objectives of this study are 1 to compare the advantages of the mri and the ri and 2 to ascertain whether the changes in extreme flows can be attributed to the effects of the reservoirs by using nonstationary flood frequency models to achieve these objectives nonstationary flood frequency models are developed using the mri and ri as a covariate in the gamlss framework respectively to avoid the potential confounding effects of climatic variability a covariate that characterizes the key climatological properties is taken into account in the flood frequency models all the nonstationary models are used to fit the annual maximum daily flow amdf at boluo a gauge station in the lower reaches of the djr basin to ascertain whether the changes in the amdf can be attributed to the effects of the reservoirs in addition for the purpose of comparison one stationary flood frequency model is also developed to fit the same dataset as the nonstationary models the significance of the indices used as covariates are also tested this study provides an effective and practical reservoir index used to assess the impacts of reservoirs on extreme flows from the perspective of nonstationary analyses the results allow for a better understanding of the type of changes in the floods that are expected with an increasing regulation effect of the reservoirs and contributes to the flood control 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the djr fig 1 located in the south of china is the second largest tributary of the pearl river with a length of 562 km and a drainage area of 27 040 km2 the djr basin has a subtropical climate and its annual rainfall ranges from 1500 to 2400 mm liu et al 2010 the water resources in the djr basin are highly developed for the purposes of water supply hydropower irrigation navigation and suppression of seawater invasion zhang et al 2015 the djr is one of the most important water sources for the pearl river delta including hong kong and accounts for about 80 of hong kong s water demand 2 2 extreme flow data the amdf fig 2 at the boluo station covers the period 1956 2013 the station is located in the downstream area of the djr basin the extreme flow data used in this study are provided by the hydrological bureau of guangdong province the quality of the data was checked prior to the release and there were no missing extreme flow data 2 3 covariates 2 3 1 precipitation precipitation p is the main source of runoff in the djr basin especially the wet season precipitation and there is a significant correlation between these variables jiang et al 2007 liu et al 2010 previous studies have demonstrated that the climate variability can be reflected by the precipitation variations when assessing the impacts of climate variability on hydrology sankarasubramanian et al 2001 zhou et al 2010 prosdocimi et al 2015 therefore to avoid the potential confounding effects of climate variability the precipitation amount in the 7 days fig 3 prior to the date of the amdf data considering the time of runoff confluence in the djr basin is used as a covariate that characterizes the key climatological properties it is included in the nonstationary flood frequency models the precipitation data are extracted from the daily precipitation data obtained from the national meteorological information center http data cma cn 2 3 2 modified reservoir index mri lópez and francés 2013 proposed an ri to represent the impacts of reservoirs on hydrologic extremes it is defined as eq 1 1 ri i 1 k a i a t v i v t where k is the number of reservoirs upstream of the gauge station ai is the catchment area of each reservoir at is the catchment area of the gauge station vi is the total capacity of each reservoir and vt is the mean annual runoff at the gauge station however as mentioned in the introduction all the variables in an ri series are constants in a specific period resulting in a constant ri regardless of the reservoir regulation strategies the other reservoir indices such as the check dam indices li et al 2015a are more complicated and need several kinds of data e g the land use historical observed rainstorm and flood data in such a case it may be difficult to calculate the check dam index since not all of the data needed can be met in some regions in fact the regulation effect of a reservoir is related to the annual runoff for example a reservoir stores more runoff in the wet season to meet the water demand in the dry season during the low flow years and this greatly impacts the surface runoff on the other hand the utilizable capacity is the maximum capacity used for runoff regulation and contributes more to the regulation of extreme flows than the total capacity of a reservoir note that the dead storage capacity which is part of the total capacity of a reservoir does not contribute to the regulation of extreme flows consequently the utilizable capacity of a reservoir is more suitable to reflect the impacts of reservoirs on runoff than the total capacity in order to consider the above mentioned deficiency a simpler and more practical reservoir index which takes into account the regulation strategies on the basis of the ri lópez and francés 2013 is proposed in this study as shown in eq 2 2 mri i 1 k a i a t v i r t where k ai and at are the same as in eq 1 whereas v i is the utilizable capacity of the i reservoir and rt is the annual runoff at the gauge station to have a visual understanding of the differences between the ri and mri the following example is provided there are three major reservoirs in the djr basin namely xinfengjiang xfj fengshuba fsb and baipenzhu bpz table 1 shows the basic characteristics of these three reservoirs and the data are provided by the hydrological bureau of guangdong province fig 4 shows the results of the ri and mri calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively it can be seen from fig 4 that the ri changes stepwise over time whereas the mri fluctuates after the reservoirs were built 3 methodology 3 1 generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss a gamlss model assumes that yi i 1 2 n n is the sample size are independent observations of the response variable with a probability density function f yi θ i where θ i θ i1 θ i2 θ im is a vector of m distribution parameters representing the location scale and shape e g skewness and kurtosis parameters let yt y 1 y 2 yn where yt is a vector of the response variable with a length of n let gk k 1 2 m be a known monotonic link function that is used to connect the distribution parameters to the explanatory variables covariates the relationship between the distribution parameters and explanatory variables described by an additive model is as follows 3 g k θ k β k x k η k j 1 j k z j k γ j k where θ k and β k are n length vectors xk is a known n j k design matrix η k t η 1 k η 2 k η j k k is a parameter vector of length j k zjk is a fixed known n mkj design matrix and γ jk is a random variable that is mkj dimensional xk η k is a parametric component which has linear or nonlinear functions of explanatory variables zjk γ jk are additive components representing random effects the subscript j represents the jth random effect and mkj represents the dimension of the random factor in the jth random effect in particular if k 1 2 n and jk 0 namely if there are no additive terms in any of the distribution parameters eq 3 becomes a simple linear parametric gamlss model as follows 4 g k θ k β k x k η k this means that the n length vectors of the distributional parameters can be modeled as a function of the covariates the likelihood function in this case with respect to the η parameters is 5 l η 1 η 2 η m i 1 n f y i η 1 η 2 η m the rigby and stasinopoulos rs algorithm recommended by rigby and stasinopoulos 1996a 1996b is used to maximize the likelihood in eq 5 3 2 models used in the study for the nonstationary modeling of extreme flows it is important to select an appropriate distribution in this study a practical way recommended by jiang and xiong 2012 is adopted firstly the candidate distributions which are commonly used in stream flow modeling are chosen to fit the extreme flows under stationary condition secondly the fitting results are evaluated by the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 and finally the optimum distribution is determined to be the one with the minimum aic value based on the method of jiang and xiong 2012 eight distributions widely used in stream flow modeling gumbel gu gamma ga weibull wei logistic lo lognormal logno generalized gamma gg normal no and the generalized extreme value gev are chosen as candidate distributions to fit the amdf at the boluo station under stationary condition it is observed from table 2 that the ga distribution is the optimum distribution among the eight candidate distributions thus the ga distribution is chosen as the distribution used for the nonstationary model construction and for modeling the amdf in this study note that the ga distribution eq 6 used to model the extreme flow in this study follows the notation in the gamlss which is defined as eq 6 rigby and stasinopoulos 2007 6 f y μ σ 1 σ 2 μ 1 σ 2 y 1 σ 2 1 exp y σ 2 μ γ 1 σ 2 y 0 μ 0 σ 0 here e y μ and var y σ2μ2 where μ and σ are denoted as the location and scale parameters respectively this is a reparameterization of the traditional ga function johnson et al 1994 obtained by setting σ2 1 α and μ αβ the following eq 7 shows the monotonic link functions for the parameters μ and σ of eq 6 in the gamlss 7 g 1 μ log μ β 1 x 1 η 1 g 2 σ log σ β 2 x 2 η 2 nonstationarity e g trend can occur in any statistical parameter e g mean variance skewness or kurtosis of a hydrological time series wang et al 1997 jiang and xiong 2012 on the other hand there is a significant decreasing trend in the amdf at the 90 level fig 2 and table 12 and no obvious nonlinear relationship is found between the amdf and covariates thus to consider all possible effects of the covariates on the nonstationarity of hydrological extremes the nonstationary settings for the parameters of the ga distribution are modeled as a function of the covariates as follows type i the location parameter is modeled as a linear function of the covariates but the scale parameter is a constant 8 log μ μ 0 i 1 p μ i x i log σ σ 0 type ii the location parameter is a constant but the scale parameter is modeled as a linear function of the covariates 9 log μ μ 0 log σ σ 0 i 1 p σ i x i type iii both the location and scale parameters are modeled as linear functions of the covariates 10 log μ μ 0 i 1 p μ i x i log σ σ 0 i 1 p σ i x i where xi represents the covariates i e p ri or mri μ i and σ i are the slopes of the location and scale parameters respectively μ0 and σ0 are the intercepts the models including one stationary model i e ga 0 based on the gamlss framework with a ga distribution are shown in table 3 3 3 significance of the nonstationary model the log likelihood values between two models can be used to perform a likelihood ratio lr tests the lr test statistic i e twice the difference between the negative log likelihood of two models eq 11 approximately follows a chi square distribution with dp degrees of freedom katz 2013 11 2 l r s l r n χ 2 d p where l r s log l η 1 η 2 and l r n log l η 1 η 2 are the negative log likelihood of two ga models respectively dp is the difference in the number of parameters between the two models the lr test is used to evaluate if the addition of one or multiple covariates to a model corresponds to a substantial increase in the variance explained by the model as described by coles 2001 and madsen et al 2014 in addition the significance of a model when compared to a nested model can be determined by the p value of the chi square distribution in this study if a nonstationary model has an lr test p value of less than 0 05 it is considered significant and reasonable it should be noted that the lr tests can be performed only between nested models namely the model with fewer parameters can be obtained by constraining some of the parameters of the model with more parameters for instance ga 0 is nested within ga 11 because ga 0 can be obtained from ga 11 with μ1 0 ga 11 is nested within ga 14 since ga 11 corresponds to ga 14 by letting μ2 0 it is the same case for ga 11 and ga 31 3 4 selection of the best model to rank the performance of all nested and non nested models the aic criterion can be used it is the authoritative criterion in the gamlss recommended by rigby and stasinopoulos 2007 which is defined as eq 12 12 aic g d 2 d f where gd 2 ln l β 1 β 2 represents the global deviation of the ga model ln l β 1 β 2 is the logarithmic likelihood corresponding to the estimated values of the regression parameters 2 represents the penalty factor and df is the degree of freedom for the model parameter estimation the smaller the value of aic is the better the model fits 3 5 quantile of the nonstationary model the cumulative distribution function of eq 6 is the regularized ga function as follows 13 f y y μ σ 0 y 1 σ 2 μ 1 σ 2 y 1 σ 2 1 exp y σ 2 μ γ 1 σ 2 γ 1 σ 2 y μ σ 2 γ 1 σ 2 where γ 1 σ2 y μσ2 is the lower incomplete ga function let φ 1 be the inverse function of the cumulative distribution function of the ga distribution for a specific exceedance probability p equating to a quantile of 1 p the design values y can be calculated by eq 14 and its corresponding return level can be obtained by eq 15 14 y φ 1 φ f y y μ σ 1 p 1 15 t 1 p where t represents the return period note that for a nonstationary model the estimated parameters of μ and σ are vectors eq 16 with the same length as the response variable y or the covariates xi 16 μ μ 1 μ 2 μ n σ σ 1 σ 2 σ n thus for a specific exceedance probability p the values of the design flood y are also a vector of length n consequently the design values of the nonstationary model with a specific exceedance probability will vary over time unlike in the stationary model 4 results 4 1 the significance of covariates for the extreme flows in this section we present the results of the three types of models for fitting the amdf including the estimated negative logarithmic likelihood values the aic values and twice the difference between the negative log likelihood of two nested models and its corresponding lr test in addition the estimated model parameters are also presented these results can be used to evaluate the significance of adding or removing a covariate to or from the fitting results of the models tables 4 and 5 show the fitting results and the estimated model parameters of the type i models respectively as can be seen from table 4 ga 15 has the best performance among the five models followed by ga 13 ga 14 ga 11 and ga 11 and the performances of the five nonstationary models are all better than those of the stationary one ga 0 the twice the difference values between the negative log likelihood of the ga 11 ga 13 and ga 0 are 14 87 and 35 65 respectively which both pass the lr test at the 0 05 level threshold 3 84 this indicates that both the p and mri are the significant covariates for the extreme flow and the model performance significantly increases when they are added to the location parameter similarly the same conclusion can be obtained from the lr tests between the ga 15 ga 11 and ga 13 the difference in the values of the double likelihoods of the ga 15 and ga 13 is 35 72 whereas it is 14 94 of the ga 15 and ga 13 which indicates that the increase in the likelihood results in a lower p value when the mri is introduced into the model ga 11 than when p is introduced in other words the effect of the mri on the extreme flow is greater than the effect of the p the weight of coefficient of the mri for the location parameter is significantly greater than that of p table 5 which also demonstrates this conclusion the lr test of ga 12 and the ga 0 does not pass the significant test at the 0 05 level indicating that the ri is not a covariate for the amdf when it considered in the location parameter in addition the lr tests of ga 14 against ga 11 and ga 12 have values of 8 42 and 21 15 indicating that the explanatory power of the model increases more when the ri is introduced once p is included in the model than when p is added once ri is included in the model the results show that the covariate mri has the greatest effect on the location parameter followed by the p and ri tables 6 and 7 show the fitting results and the estimated model parameters of the type ii models respectively it can be observed from table 6 that the ranking of the performances of these five nonstationary models for fitting the same time series is ga 23 ga 25 ga 22 ga 24 and ga 21 two of them namely ga 23 and ga 25 have better performances than the stationary model ga 0 but only the lr test between the ga 25 and ga 0 passes the significance test at the 0 05 level although the fitting effects of the ga 23 and ga 25 are better than the stationary model their improvements of the model performance are not remarkable the difference in the values of the double likelihoods of the ga 23 and ga 0 is 3 79 and this value is larger than the value for the models ga 21 and ga 0 which indicates that the increase in the likelihood is greater when the mri covariate is introduced into the model than when the p covariate is introduced furthermore that the weight of coefficient of the mri has an absolute greater value than that of p for the scale parameter as showed in table 7 also demonstrates this conclusion similarly the same conclusion can be drawn by comparing the lr test between the ga 21 ga 23 and ga 25 respectively the lr test between the model ga 22 and the stationary model ga 0 does not pass the significance test at the 0 05 level which shows that the covariate ri is not a significant covariate for the amdf when it is considered in the scale parameter in addition a comparison of the lr test values of the models ga 24 ga 21 and ga 22 demonstrates that the introduction of the ri covariate into the model ga 21 increases the explanatory power of the model more than the introduction of the p covariate into the model ga 22 that is the effect on the model performance is greater for the ri than for the p the results show that the mri has the greatest influence on the scale parameter followed by the ri and p though three of them are not significant covariates for the amdf in this case tables 8 and 9 represent the fitting results and the estimated model parameters of the type iii models respectively the term ga 31 ga 0 in table 8 represents twice the difference of the negative logarithmic likelihood between the ga 31 and ga 0 the aic values indicate that the ga 35 is the best fit model among the five nonstationary models followed by ga 33 ga 34 ga 31 and ga 32 except for ga 32 the performances of the remaining four models are better than those of the stationary model ga 0 and the lr tests of these four models against the ga 0 are all significant at the 0 05 level this indicates that the mri and p are significant covariates for both the location and scale parameters whereas the ri is not the results show that the covariate mri has the most influence on the model performances when it is added in both the location and scale parameters followed by the p and ri overall the lr tests indicate that the mri and p are significant covariates of the amdf when they are considered in the location parameter or both the location and scale parameters whereas the ri is a significant covariate for the amdf only when it is considered in the scale parameter 4 2 the effects of covariates on the extreme flows in this section we present the fitting results of the nonstationary models using the same physical process as a covariate for different parameters table 10 the ga 31 in which both the location and scale parameters use the p as a covariate is the best fit model among the three models with p as a covariate followed by the ga 11 that considers a change only in the location parameter and the ga 21 that considers the scale parameter as a linear function with p note that only the ga 11 and ga 13 have better performances than the stationary model ga 0 this indicates that the introduction of p in the location parameter or both the location and scale parameters of models results in greater and more significant improvements in the model performance than the introduce of p only in scale parameter among the three models with ri as covariates only the ga 12 has a better performance than the stationary model ga 0 however the model performances improved by the ri is not as large as the p among the three models with mri as covariates the ga 33 is the best fit model followed by the ga 13 and ga 23 all of these three models have better performances than the stationary model this demonstrates that the effect of the mri on the extreme flow can be reflected by introducing it as a covariate in any parameter of the ga distribution whereas the effect of the ri on the extreme flow can be reflected only by introducing it in the scale parameter the results imply that the mri is more appropriate than the ri to assess the effect of reservoirs on the changes in the extreme flow furthermore fig 5 shows the quantile results of the best fit model for each covariate it is observed that the quantile results of the best fit models that incorporate both the ri and mri as covariates show a downward trend which is in line with the trend of the amdf however it should be noted that the ability of the best fit model to capture extreme values is significantly greater for the model with the mri as a covariate than for the model with the ri as a covariate for example in the ga 33 model the extreme values in 1963 1966 and 2004 are included in the 0 05 and 0 95 quantile range whereas they are not included in the ga 12 the quantile results of the ga 31 which is the best fit model of the p covariate show a slight upward trend which is opposite to the trend of the amdf moreover the larger the quantile the smaller the fluctuation is and the weaker the ability to capture the extreme values compared to the previous two best fit models which may imply that precipitation is not the only cause for the changes in the amdf in other words in addition to precipitation the extreme flow in the djr basin may be influenced by other factors such as human activities 4 3 nonstationary modeling of the extreme flows the ranking of the performances of all nonstationary models based on the aic values table 11 indicates that the ga 35 with the mri and p as covariates for both the location and scale parameters is the best fit model followed by the ga 15 model that uses the mri and p and only considered in the location parameter the ga 33 and ga 13 are ranked 3rd and 4th respectively and both models use the mri as covariates the performances of the other models that use the p or ri or both as covariates are ranked behind the models that use the mri as covariates the performance of the stationary model ga 0 is ranked 12th among all models and there are four nonstationary models namely ga 22 ga 32 ga 24 and ga 21 that have worse performances than the stationary model with regard to the ranking of the best fit models for a single covariate the best fit model ga 33 for the mri covariate is ranked 2nd among all models whereas the best fit models that use the p and ri covariates namely ga 31 and ga 12 are ranked 6th and 11th respectively these three models have better performances than the stationary model the introduction of the mri in the nonstationary models results in more significant improvements in the model performance than the introduction of p or ri that is the mri has the greatest impact on the model performances followed by the p and ri with regard to the ranking of the best fit models with two or more covariates the ga 35 which is the best fit model with the p and mri as covariates for both the location and scale parameters is ranked 1st whereas the best fit model ga 34 with the p and ri as covariates is ranked 5th in addition the performances of these two models are not only superior to the performance of the stationary model but are also better than those in which a single physical process is used as a covariate the results imply that the changes in the amdf attributed to the effects of precipitation and reservoirs are much more realistic than those attributed only to the effects of the precipitation or the reservoirs that is the amdf is influenced by both the precipitation and the reservoirs but the latter is more significant fig 6 further shows the quantile results of the ga 35 and ga 34 the ga 35 is the best fit model that uses the p and mri as covariates and the ga 34 is the best fit model that uses the p and ri as covariates it is observed that the quantiles of these two models all show a downward trend which is in agreement with the trend of the amdf however the ability to capture the extreme values is greater for the ga 35 than for the ga 34 for example the extreme value in 1966 is included in the 0 05 and 0 95 quantile range in the ga 35 but the extreme value is not included in the same range of the ga 34 this means that the ability to explain the changes in the extreme flow is greater for the ga 35 that uses the p and mri as covariates than for the ga 34 that uses the p and ri as covariates in addition a comparison of the models that use both the p and mri or only the p as covariates indicates that the model s ability to capture the extreme values is significantly higher when the mri and the p are used as covariates than when only the p is used as a covariate indicating that the extreme flow in the djr basin is indeed impacted by the combined effects of precipitation and reservoirs 5 discussion 5 1 relationship between the amdf and precipitation fig 7 shows the results of the correlation analysis between the amdf and the p ri and mri it is observed that the amdf is significantly correlated with the p and mri and the correlation coefficients are significant at the 0 05 level the correlation between the amdf and ri does not pass the significance test at the 0 05 level however fig 2 and table 12 show that the amdf has a downward trend with a rate of 36 2 m³ s and passes the significance test at the 0 1 level whereas the precipitation has an upward trend though it is not significant at the 0 1 level this is opposite to the trend of the amdf wang et al 2008 pointed out that the effect of water reservoirs is the main reason for the inconsistency in the trends of runoff and precipitation that is precipitation is not the only factor affecting the amdf in the djr basin other factors such as reservoir construction also have large impacts on the runoff in the djr basin consequently the fitting of the nonstationary models is improved by increasing the number of factors that affect the amdf this is the main reason why the models that include the mri and p as covariates have better performances than the models that only use the mri or p as a covariate 5 2 influences of the reservoirs on extreme flows as mentioned in the introduction a large number of reservoirs have been constructed in the djr basin since the 1950s and up to 2006 896 reservoirs were built with a total capacity of 190 108 m³ in this basin zhang et al 2015 the xfj fsb and bpz are the three major large reservoirs in the djr basin with a total capacity up to 170 66 108 m³ table 1 accounting for approximately 90 of the total capacity of reservoirs in the djr basin and 70 of the annual runoff at boluo station in addition the total catchment area of the three reservoirs almost accounts for half of the catchment area of the djr basin this means that the three reservoirs have a considerable ability to regulate the runoff fig 8 shows the results of the mean daily inflow and outflow of the xfj reservoir from january 1 1961 to september 18 2010 and the data are provided by the hydrological bureau of guangdong province it can be seen from fig 8 a that the inflow has a very large range and a maximum value greater than 7000 m³ s 1964 06 15 whereas the outflow is flat and its maximum is less than 1250 m³ s 1983 06 19 fig 8 b shows the flood hydrograph before and after the regulation of the xfj reservoir for a specific flood event the flood hydrograph becomes rather flat after the xfj reservoir regulation and the peak flood is reduced sharply from 6777 2 m³ s to less than 500 m³ s which means that the reservoir has a large impact on the extreme flows in the djr basin wang 2007 also investigated the impacts of the xfj reservoir on the extreme flows in the drj basin the results showed that the flood peak at the heyuan gauge station fig 1 was reduced from 1570 m³ s to 6560 m³ s and the water level decreased from 1 47 to 4 96 m ye et al 2013 analyzed the frequency of the amdf at longchuan fig 1 a hydrological station at the downstream of the fsb reservoir in the djr basin the results showed that among the six flood events with an exceedance probability of less than 0 1 only one flood event occurred after the construction of the fsb reservoir 1973 the mean amdf was 2374 m³ s before the construction of the fsb reservoir and decreased to 1234 m³ s after the reservoir was built results of hydrological models also showed that the reservoirs had great impacts on the stream flow in the djr basin lai et al 2016 found that the fractional contribution of human activities to the increase of the streamflow ranged from 0 23 to 0 73 by using the elastic coefficient model lin et al 2012 identified the quantitative effect of climate change and human activity on runoff in the djr basin based on the soil conservation service scs model the results showed that the impacts due to climate change and human activity were half and half furthermore tu et al 2012 and ye et al 2013 pointed out that the construction of reservoirs was the main human activities resulting in the nonstationarity of the runoff especially for the extreme flows in the djr basin this further supports the findings in section 4 3 that the mri is more appropriate than the ri to show the impacts of reservoirs on the changes in the extreme flows and the construction of reservoirs is one of the main causes for the nonstatioanrity of extreme flows in addition due to the booming economy and increasing population the demand for water resources has increased significantly in the djr basin to meet the water demand in this region the government of guangdong province adjusted the function priority of the three major reservoirs in recent years the xfj reservoir was originally designed for power generation but its current purposes are flood control and water supply the major functions of the fsb reservoir are shipping and the reservoir is now mainly used for flood control and water supply similarly the major functions of the bpz reservoir have changed from flood control and irrigation to flood control and water supply the changes in the functions of the three reservoirs place more importance on the water supply which means that the effects of the regulation on the streamflow in the djr basin will increase in the future it should be pointed that except for precipitation and reservoirs there are other potential factors that impact the runoff in the djr basin such as urbanization ye et al 2013 thus additional explanatory variables should be taken into account in the nonstationary flood frequency analysis and quantitative analysis should be performed to determine their effects in future studies 5 3 the effect of exceptional events prosdocimi et al 2015 investigated the effects of influential points and found that if a leverage point was characterized greater by the rainfall variable than the urban variable the removal of the leverage point increased the significance of the urban variable in contrast if the leverage point was characterized greater by the urban variable than the rainfall variable removing the leverage point from the data set increased the significance of the rainfall variable however the results in fig 6 show that the extreme value in 1979 is outside the 0 05 to 0 95 quantile range although this extreme value is not the largest value in the amdf series and both the effects of precipitation and reservoir are considered in the model however some of the extreme values that are larger than the 1979 value are included in the same quantile range such as the extreme value in 1966 on the other hand the removal of the extreme value in 1979 does not increase the significance of the precipitation or the mri we investigated the cause of this phenomenon and found that the amdf in 1979 was mainly attributed to the flood event that occurred in the xizhijiang basin fig 1 which is a sub catchment of the djr basin note that the bpz reservoir was completed in 1983 and no other reservoirs exist in the section between the bpz reservoir and the boluo gauge station thus the effects of the reservoirs on the extreme flows are not reflected by the mri or ri in addition using the precipitation amount in the 7 days prior to the date of the amdf in the whole djr basin may not be appropriate to represent the flood events in a sub catchment in the djr basin moreover except for precipitation and reservoirs there may be other potential factors that are responsible for the changes of extreme flows such as land use change ye et al 2013 this is the main reason for the poor fit of the extreme value in 1979 6 conclusions in this study we modified the ri proposed by lópez and francés 2013 to investigate whether the changes in extreme flows can be attributed to the effects of reservoirs by using nonstationary flood frequency analyses based on the gamlss framework nonstationary flood frequency models were developed using the mri as a covariate and were used to fit the amdf at the boluo station in the djr basin that has been greatly impacted by reservoir construction our findings are summarized as follows the results show that the mri is a significant covariate for the extreme flow in the djr basin and its ability to show the effects of reservoir on the extreme flow can be reflected by introducing it as a covariate in the location parameter or both the location and scale parameters of the ga distribution whereas the ri is a significant variable for the extreme flow only when it is introduced in the scale parameter using the mri as a covariate results in greater performance improvements of the nonstationary models and a better ability to capture the extreme values than the use of the ri for fitting the amdf the mri is more practical and effective than the ri with regard to reflecting the changes in the extreme flows the effects of reservoir on extreme flows at the boluo station in the djr basin are significant and even greater than the effects of precipitation though the latter is usually regarded as the most important factor leading to the changes in extreme flows this implies that the effect of reservoir is one of the main causes for the nonstationarity of the extreme flow in the djr basin furthermore with the increasing demand for water resources and the function adjustment of the xfj fsb and bpz reservoirs the effects of reservoirs on extreme flows in the djr basin will increase in future the results also show that the performance of the nonstationary models is higher in most models when the covariates are introduced in the location parameter or both the location and scale parameters than in those using the same variables as covariates only in the scale parameter but in some cases the performance of the models introducing the covariates in the scale parameter is higher than those with the covariates introduced in the location parameter or both the location and scale parameters as presented in 4 2 section thus to consider all possible effects of the covariates on the nonstationarity of hydrological extremes it is necessary to use the physical processes as covariates in all model parameters acknowledgments the research is financially supported by national

700,the purpose of this study is to ascertain whether the changes in extreme hydrologic time series can be attributed to the reservoir operations by using nonstationary flood frequency analyses on the basis of the reservoir index ri a modified reservoir index mri was put forward and used as a covariate to represent the effects of reservoirs on extreme flows using the generalized additive model for location scale and shape gamlss nonstationary flood frequency models were developed with the mri covariate the models were applied to fit the annual maximum daily flow amdf from 1956 to 2013 at boluo the control gauge station of the dongjiang river djr basin which is strongly influenced by reservoirs in addition to avoid the potential impacts of climatic variability on extreme flows a precipitation covariate that characterizes the key climatological properties is taken into account in the nonstationary flood frequency models the results show that the mri is superior to the ri to reflect the effects of reservoirs on the extreme flows which is more effective and practical and it is a significant explanatory variable for the extreme flows in the nonstationary modeling a significant effect of the reservoirs on the extreme flows is detected with the mri and this effect is greater than the precipitation effect in addition with the increasing demand for water resources and the transformation of reservoir functions the effects of the reservoirs on extreme flows in the djr basin will further increase keywords extreme flows nonstationarity flood frequency analysis modified reservoir index effects of the reservoirs the dongjiang river basin 1 introduction the hypothesis of stationarity is the cornerstone of traditional flood frequency analysis and is based on the assumption that the factors affecting the hydrological variables do not change over time um et al 2017 serago et al 2018 however under the influences of climate change and anthropogenic activities the factors affecting the hydrological variables have been altered resulting in the absence of stationarity in hydrological time series khaliq et al 2006 chen et al 2013 tang et al 2017 milly et al 2008 pointed out that future water resource risk assessments would face great challenges in such a changing environment for example gilroy et al 2011 determined that a 30 2 increase in the 100 yr flood would occur in 2100 in the little patuxent river in guilford in maryland when considering the influences of climate change and human activities thus the influences of these external factors on the flood frequency analysis should be taken into account as a result of the increased focus on nonstationary flood frequency analysis myriad approaches for the frequency analysis of nonstationary hydrological time series have been developed in the past decades e g strupczewski et al 2001 cunderlik and burn 2003 khaliq et al 2006 villarini et al 2009 salas et al 2012 bayazit et al 2015 yan et al 2017 despite an increased emphasis on nonstationarity hydrologists still have great doubts about the design values of the proposed methods on account of the drawbacks of the methods and the lack of effective means of testing the assumptions stedinger and griffis 2011 read and vogel 2015 salas et al 2018 for example the design value with a specific exceedance probability under nonstationary conditions is no longer a constant as that under stationary conditions but a set of values that varies over time therefore montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 pointed out that an elaborate model selection analysis should be implemented prior to the selection of a nonstationary model because a nonstationary model may turn out to be less efficient than a stationary model in view of the increased uncertainty before switching to a fully nonstationary modeling paradigm much research is required in further studies montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 also emphasized that scientific evidence should be provided so that the changes in hydrological time series can be detected if the changes in the hydrological time series have been identified the causes of such changes i e an understanding of the drivers of the detected changes should be investigated merz et al 2012 prosdocimi et al 2015 in recent years researchers have begun to take into account the effects of climate variability e g global warming and human activities e g construction of dams irrigation of crops urbanization on hydrological extreme events in nonstationary analysis e g villarini et al 2009 gilroy et al 2011 lópez and francés 2013 zhang et al 2015 gao et al 2016 collet et al 2017 collet et al 2017 evaluated the effects of climate change on extreme flows and detected a remarkable increase in the 100 yr precipitation in the eastern uk villarini et al 2009 used the generalized additive model for location scale and shape gamlss and developed a nonstationary flood frequency analysis framework to fit the annual maximum peak discharge records in little sugar creek a highly urbanized watershed the results showed that the nonstationary models based on the gamlss framework were able to describe the variability in the mean and variance of the annual maximum peak discharge and exhibited the impacts of urbanization on flood events prosdocimi et al 2015 further investigated the effects of urbanization on extreme flows and found that long term changes in the observed series of high flows could be attributed to changes in land use via nonstationary flood frequency analyses these studies demonstrated that climate change and human activities had great impacts on the extreme events the effects of reservoirs on catchment hydrology processes have been acknowledged for several decades worldwide at least conceptually knighton et al 1988 graf et al 1999 payan et al 2008 liu et al 2010 zhao et al 2012 lópez and francés 2013 li et al 2015a 2015b these studies showed that the effects of reservoirs especially reservoirs with large capacities have greatly impacted the catchment hydrology processes e g runoff and that these effects are one of the causes for the violation of the stationarity of hydrological time series the dongjiang river djr is the second longest tributary of the pearl river to meet the demand of water resources for agricultural irrigation flood control and water supply in the downstream djr basin a number of reservoirs have been built since the 1950s up to 2006 896 reservoirs have been constructed with a total capacity of 190 108 m³ zhang et al 2015 the construction of the reservoirs has greatly influenced the hydrologic processes in this basin wang et al 2008 liu et al 2010 tu et al 2012 ye et al 2013 for example an apparent downward trend of the extreme flows in the djr basin was detected by liu et al 2010 and ye et al 2013 and the construction of water conservancy projects e g reservoirs was one of the main causes for the decline in the extreme flows in addition the djr basin is a region with high flood hazard risks and suffers serious damage from flood hazard wang et al 2015 the investigation of the effect of reservoirs on runoff processes will contribute to the understanding of the driver factors for the nonstationarity of flood which helps to the flood control and countermeasures making the key point to investigate the effects of reservoirs on runoff processes is to quantify the effects by taking into account the regulation strategies it is common that the effects of reservoirs on the hydrological processes are analyzed based on the change in the runoff before and after the construction of reservoirs or by using simulation results of hydrological models in recent years many studies have investigated the effects of reservoirs on the extreme flows based on the nonstationary flood frequency analysis with an index to represent the impacts of reservoir lópez and francés 2013 li et al 2015a 2015b zhang et al 2015 the index used in these studies is on the basis of the reservoir index ri proposed by lópez and francés 2013 by adopting it directly or in a modified way as a covariate the ri can be taken into account in nonstationary models to investigate the impacts of reservoirs on flood regimes however all the variables in an ri series are constants in a specific period this results in a constant ri regardless of the reservoir regulation strategies li et al 2015a the other reservoir indices e g the check dam index are much more complicated and need varied data e g the check dam index needs land use rainstorm and flood data which may result in the limitation of application in addition the significance of the reservoir indices is yet to be tested considering the drawbacks of the present reservoir indices a simpler and more practical reservoir index that takes into account the regulation strategies called modified reservoir index mri hereinafter is proposed in this study see section 2 3 2 and used as a covariate in the nonstationary models to assess the effects of reservoirs on extreme flows the main objectives of this study are 1 to compare the advantages of the mri and the ri and 2 to ascertain whether the changes in extreme flows can be attributed to the effects of the reservoirs by using nonstationary flood frequency models to achieve these objectives nonstationary flood frequency models are developed using the mri and ri as a covariate in the gamlss framework respectively to avoid the potential confounding effects of climatic variability a covariate that characterizes the key climatological properties is taken into account in the flood frequency models all the nonstationary models are used to fit the annual maximum daily flow amdf at boluo a gauge station in the lower reaches of the djr basin to ascertain whether the changes in the amdf can be attributed to the effects of the reservoirs in addition for the purpose of comparison one stationary flood frequency model is also developed to fit the same dataset as the nonstationary models the significance of the indices used as covariates are also tested this study provides an effective and practical reservoir index used to assess the impacts of reservoirs on extreme flows from the perspective of nonstationary analyses the results allow for a better understanding of the type of changes in the floods that are expected with an increasing regulation effect of the reservoirs and contributes to the flood control 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the djr fig 1 located in the south of china is the second largest tributary of the pearl river with a length of 562 km and a drainage area of 27 040 km2 the djr basin has a subtropical climate and its annual rainfall ranges from 1500 to 2400 mm liu et al 2010 the water resources in the djr basin are highly developed for the purposes of water supply hydropower irrigation navigation and suppression of seawater invasion zhang et al 2015 the djr is one of the most important water sources for the pearl river delta including hong kong and accounts for about 80 of hong kong s water demand 2 2 extreme flow data the amdf fig 2 at the boluo station covers the period 1956 2013 the station is located in the downstream area of the djr basin the extreme flow data used in this study are provided by the hydrological bureau of guangdong province the quality of the data was checked prior to the release and there were no missing extreme flow data 2 3 covariates 2 3 1 precipitation precipitation p is the main source of runoff in the djr basin especially the wet season precipitation and there is a significant correlation between these variables jiang et al 2007 liu et al 2010 previous studies have demonstrated that the climate variability can be reflected by the precipitation variations when assessing the impacts of climate variability on hydrology sankarasubramanian et al 2001 zhou et al 2010 prosdocimi et al 2015 therefore to avoid the potential confounding effects of climate variability the precipitation amount in the 7 days fig 3 prior to the date of the amdf data considering the time of runoff confluence in the djr basin is used as a covariate that characterizes the key climatological properties it is included in the nonstationary flood frequency models the precipitation data are extracted from the daily precipitation data obtained from the national meteorological information center http data cma cn 2 3 2 modified reservoir index mri lópez and francés 2013 proposed an ri to represent the impacts of reservoirs on hydrologic extremes it is defined as eq 1 1 ri i 1 k a i a t v i v t where k is the number of reservoirs upstream of the gauge station ai is the catchment area of each reservoir at is the catchment area of the gauge station vi is the total capacity of each reservoir and vt is the mean annual runoff at the gauge station however as mentioned in the introduction all the variables in an ri series are constants in a specific period resulting in a constant ri regardless of the reservoir regulation strategies the other reservoir indices such as the check dam indices li et al 2015a are more complicated and need several kinds of data e g the land use historical observed rainstorm and flood data in such a case it may be difficult to calculate the check dam index since not all of the data needed can be met in some regions in fact the regulation effect of a reservoir is related to the annual runoff for example a reservoir stores more runoff in the wet season to meet the water demand in the dry season during the low flow years and this greatly impacts the surface runoff on the other hand the utilizable capacity is the maximum capacity used for runoff regulation and contributes more to the regulation of extreme flows than the total capacity of a reservoir note that the dead storage capacity which is part of the total capacity of a reservoir does not contribute to the regulation of extreme flows consequently the utilizable capacity of a reservoir is more suitable to reflect the impacts of reservoirs on runoff than the total capacity in order to consider the above mentioned deficiency a simpler and more practical reservoir index which takes into account the regulation strategies on the basis of the ri lópez and francés 2013 is proposed in this study as shown in eq 2 2 mri i 1 k a i a t v i r t where k ai and at are the same as in eq 1 whereas v i is the utilizable capacity of the i reservoir and rt is the annual runoff at the gauge station to have a visual understanding of the differences between the ri and mri the following example is provided there are three major reservoirs in the djr basin namely xinfengjiang xfj fengshuba fsb and baipenzhu bpz table 1 shows the basic characteristics of these three reservoirs and the data are provided by the hydrological bureau of guangdong province fig 4 shows the results of the ri and mri calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively it can be seen from fig 4 that the ri changes stepwise over time whereas the mri fluctuates after the reservoirs were built 3 methodology 3 1 generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss a gamlss model assumes that yi i 1 2 n n is the sample size are independent observations of the response variable with a probability density function f yi θ i where θ i θ i1 θ i2 θ im is a vector of m distribution parameters representing the location scale and shape e g skewness and kurtosis parameters let yt y 1 y 2 yn where yt is a vector of the response variable with a length of n let gk k 1 2 m be a known monotonic link function that is used to connect the distribution parameters to the explanatory variables covariates the relationship between the distribution parameters and explanatory variables described by an additive model is as follows 3 g k θ k β k x k η k j 1 j k z j k γ j k where θ k and β k are n length vectors xk is a known n j k design matrix η k t η 1 k η 2 k η j k k is a parameter vector of length j k zjk is a fixed known n mkj design matrix and γ jk is a random variable that is mkj dimensional xk η k is a parametric component which has linear or nonlinear functions of explanatory variables zjk γ jk are additive components representing random effects the subscript j represents the jth random effect and mkj represents the dimension of the random factor in the jth random effect in particular if k 1 2 n and jk 0 namely if there are no additive terms in any of the distribution parameters eq 3 becomes a simple linear parametric gamlss model as follows 4 g k θ k β k x k η k this means that the n length vectors of the distributional parameters can be modeled as a function of the covariates the likelihood function in this case with respect to the η parameters is 5 l η 1 η 2 η m i 1 n f y i η 1 η 2 η m the rigby and stasinopoulos rs algorithm recommended by rigby and stasinopoulos 1996a 1996b is used to maximize the likelihood in eq 5 3 2 models used in the study for the nonstationary modeling of extreme flows it is important to select an appropriate distribution in this study a practical way recommended by jiang and xiong 2012 is adopted firstly the candidate distributions which are commonly used in stream flow modeling are chosen to fit the extreme flows under stationary condition secondly the fitting results are evaluated by the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 and finally the optimum distribution is determined to be the one with the minimum aic value based on the method of jiang and xiong 2012 eight distributions widely used in stream flow modeling gumbel gu gamma ga weibull wei logistic lo lognormal logno generalized gamma gg normal no and the generalized extreme value gev are chosen as candidate distributions to fit the amdf at the boluo station under stationary condition it is observed from table 2 that the ga distribution is the optimum distribution among the eight candidate distributions thus the ga distribution is chosen as the distribution used for the nonstationary model construction and for modeling the amdf in this study note that the ga distribution eq 6 used to model the extreme flow in this study follows the notation in the gamlss which is defined as eq 6 rigby and stasinopoulos 2007 6 f y μ σ 1 σ 2 μ 1 σ 2 y 1 σ 2 1 exp y σ 2 μ γ 1 σ 2 y 0 μ 0 σ 0 here e y μ and var y σ2μ2 where μ and σ are denoted as the location and scale parameters respectively this is a reparameterization of the traditional ga function johnson et al 1994 obtained by setting σ2 1 α and μ αβ the following eq 7 shows the monotonic link functions for the parameters μ and σ of eq 6 in the gamlss 7 g 1 μ log μ β 1 x 1 η 1 g 2 σ log σ β 2 x 2 η 2 nonstationarity e g trend can occur in any statistical parameter e g mean variance skewness or kurtosis of a hydrological time series wang et al 1997 jiang and xiong 2012 on the other hand there is a significant decreasing trend in the amdf at the 90 level fig 2 and table 12 and no obvious nonlinear relationship is found between the amdf and covariates thus to consider all possible effects of the covariates on the nonstationarity of hydrological extremes the nonstationary settings for the parameters of the ga distribution are modeled as a function of the covariates as follows type i the location parameter is modeled as a linear function of the covariates but the scale parameter is a constant 8 log μ μ 0 i 1 p μ i x i log σ σ 0 type ii the location parameter is a constant but the scale parameter is modeled as a linear function of the covariates 9 log μ μ 0 log σ σ 0 i 1 p σ i x i type iii both the location and scale parameters are modeled as linear functions of the covariates 10 log μ μ 0 i 1 p μ i x i log σ σ 0 i 1 p σ i x i where xi represents the covariates i e p ri or mri μ i and σ i are the slopes of the location and scale parameters respectively μ0 and σ0 are the intercepts the models including one stationary model i e ga 0 based on the gamlss framework with a ga distribution are shown in table 3 3 3 significance of the nonstationary model the log likelihood values between two models can be used to perform a likelihood ratio lr tests the lr test statistic i e twice the difference between the negative log likelihood of two models eq 11 approximately follows a chi square distribution with dp degrees of freedom katz 2013 11 2 l r s l r n χ 2 d p where l r s log l η 1 η 2 and l r n log l η 1 η 2 are the negative log likelihood of two ga models respectively dp is the difference in the number of parameters between the two models the lr test is used to evaluate if the addition of one or multiple covariates to a model corresponds to a substantial increase in the variance explained by the model as described by coles 2001 and madsen et al 2014 in addition the significance of a model when compared to a nested model can be determined by the p value of the chi square distribution in this study if a nonstationary model has an lr test p value of less than 0 05 it is considered significant and reasonable it should be noted that the lr tests can be performed only between nested models namely the model with fewer parameters can be obtained by constraining some of the parameters of the model with more parameters for instance ga 0 is nested within ga 11 because ga 0 can be obtained from ga 11 with μ1 0 ga 11 is nested within ga 14 since ga 11 corresponds to ga 14 by letting μ2 0 it is the same case for ga 11 and ga 31 3 4 selection of the best model to rank the performance of all nested and non nested models the aic criterion can be used it is the authoritative criterion in the gamlss recommended by rigby and stasinopoulos 2007 which is defined as eq 12 12 aic g d 2 d f where gd 2 ln l β 1 β 2 represents the global deviation of the ga model ln l β 1 β 2 is the logarithmic likelihood corresponding to the estimated values of the regression parameters 2 represents the penalty factor and df is the degree of freedom for the model parameter estimation the smaller the value of aic is the better the model fits 3 5 quantile of the nonstationary model the cumulative distribution function of eq 6 is the regularized ga function as follows 13 f y y μ σ 0 y 1 σ 2 μ 1 σ 2 y 1 σ 2 1 exp y σ 2 μ γ 1 σ 2 γ 1 σ 2 y μ σ 2 γ 1 σ 2 where γ 1 σ2 y μσ2 is the lower incomplete ga function let φ 1 be the inverse function of the cumulative distribution function of the ga distribution for a specific exceedance probability p equating to a quantile of 1 p the design values y can be calculated by eq 14 and its corresponding return level can be obtained by eq 15 14 y φ 1 φ f y y μ σ 1 p 1 15 t 1 p where t represents the return period note that for a nonstationary model the estimated parameters of μ and σ are vectors eq 16 with the same length as the response variable y or the covariates xi 16 μ μ 1 μ 2 μ n σ σ 1 σ 2 σ n thus for a specific exceedance probability p the values of the design flood y are also a vector of length n consequently the design values of the nonstationary model with a specific exceedance probability will vary over time unlike in the stationary model 4 results 4 1 the significance of covariates for the extreme flows in this section we present the results of the three types of models for fitting the amdf including the estimated negative logarithmic likelihood values the aic values and twice the difference between the negative log likelihood of two nested models and its corresponding lr test in addition the estimated model parameters are also presented these results can be used to evaluate the significance of adding or removing a covariate to or from the fitting results of the models tables 4 and 5 show the fitting results and the estimated model parameters of the type i models respectively as can be seen from table 4 ga 15 has the best performance among the five models followed by ga 13 ga 14 ga 11 and ga 11 and the performances of the five nonstationary models are all better than those of the stationary one ga 0 the twice the difference values between the negative log likelihood of the ga 11 ga 13 and ga 0 are 14 87 and 35 65 respectively which both pass the lr test at the 0 05 level threshold 3 84 this indicates that both the p and mri are the significant covariates for the extreme flow and the model performance significantly increases when they are added to the location parameter similarly the same conclusion can be obtained from the lr tests between the ga 15 ga 11 and ga 13 the difference in the values of the double likelihoods of the ga 15 and ga 13 is 35 72 whereas it is 14 94 of the ga 15 and ga 13 which indicates that the increase in the likelihood results in a lower p value when the mri is introduced into the model ga 11 than when p is introduced in other words the effect of the mri on the extreme flow is greater than the effect of the p the weight of coefficient of the mri for the location parameter is significantly greater than that of p table 5 which also demonstrates this conclusion the lr test of ga 12 and the ga 0 does not pass the significant test at the 0 05 level indicating that the ri is not a covariate for the amdf when it considered in the location parameter in addition the lr tests of ga 14 against ga 11 and ga 12 have values of 8 42 and 21 15 indicating that the explanatory power of the model increases more when the ri is introduced once p is included in the model than when p is added once ri is included in the model the results show that the covariate mri has the greatest effect on the location parameter followed by the p and ri tables 6 and 7 show the fitting results and the estimated model parameters of the type ii models respectively it can be observed from table 6 that the ranking of the performances of these five nonstationary models for fitting the same time series is ga 23 ga 25 ga 22 ga 24 and ga 21 two of them namely ga 23 and ga 25 have better performances than the stationary model ga 0 but only the lr test between the ga 25 and ga 0 passes the significance test at the 0 05 level although the fitting effects of the ga 23 and ga 25 are better than the stationary model their improvements of the model performance are not remarkable the difference in the values of the double likelihoods of the ga 23 and ga 0 is 3 79 and this value is larger than the value for the models ga 21 and ga 0 which indicates that the increase in the likelihood is greater when the mri covariate is introduced into the model than when the p covariate is introduced furthermore that the weight of coefficient of the mri has an absolute greater value than that of p for the scale parameter as showed in table 7 also demonstrates this conclusion similarly the same conclusion can be drawn by comparing the lr test between the ga 21 ga 23 and ga 25 respectively the lr test between the model ga 22 and the stationary model ga 0 does not pass the significance test at the 0 05 level which shows that the covariate ri is not a significant covariate for the amdf when it is considered in the scale parameter in addition a comparison of the lr test values of the models ga 24 ga 21 and ga 22 demonstrates that the introduction of the ri covariate into the model ga 21 increases the explanatory power of the model more than the introduction of the p covariate into the model ga 22 that is the effect on the model performance is greater for the ri than for the p the results show that the mri has the greatest influence on the scale parameter followed by the ri and p though three of them are not significant covariates for the amdf in this case tables 8 and 9 represent the fitting results and the estimated model parameters of the type iii models respectively the term ga 31 ga 0 in table 8 represents twice the difference of the negative logarithmic likelihood between the ga 31 and ga 0 the aic values indicate that the ga 35 is the best fit model among the five nonstationary models followed by ga 33 ga 34 ga 31 and ga 32 except for ga 32 the performances of the remaining four models are better than those of the stationary model ga 0 and the lr tests of these four models against the ga 0 are all significant at the 0 05 level this indicates that the mri and p are significant covariates for both the location and scale parameters whereas the ri is not the results show that the covariate mri has the most influence on the model performances when it is added in both the location and scale parameters followed by the p and ri overall the lr tests indicate that the mri and p are significant covariates of the amdf when they are considered in the location parameter or both the location and scale parameters whereas the ri is a significant covariate for the amdf only when it is considered in the scale parameter 4 2 the effects of covariates on the extreme flows in this section we present the fitting results of the nonstationary models using the same physical process as a covariate for different parameters table 10 the ga 31 in which both the location and scale parameters use the p as a covariate is the best fit model among the three models with p as a covariate followed by the ga 11 that considers a change only in the location parameter and the ga 21 that considers the scale parameter as a linear function with p note that only the ga 11 and ga 13 have better performances than the stationary model ga 0 this indicates that the introduction of p in the location parameter or both the location and scale parameters of models results in greater and more significant improvements in the model performance than the introduce of p only in scale parameter among the three models with ri as covariates only the ga 12 has a better performance than the stationary model ga 0 however the model performances improved by the ri is not as large as the p among the three models with mri as covariates the ga 33 is the best fit model followed by the ga 13 and ga 23 all of these three models have better performances than the stationary model this demonstrates that the effect of the mri on the extreme flow can be reflected by introducing it as a covariate in any parameter of the ga distribution whereas the effect of the ri on the extreme flow can be reflected only by introducing it in the scale parameter the results imply that the mri is more appropriate than the ri to assess the effect of reservoirs on the changes in the extreme flow furthermore fig 5 shows the quantile results of the best fit model for each covariate it is observed that the quantile results of the best fit models that incorporate both the ri and mri as covariates show a downward trend which is in line with the trend of the amdf however it should be noted that the ability of the best fit model to capture extreme values is significantly greater for the model with the mri as a covariate than for the model with the ri as a covariate for example in the ga 33 model the extreme values in 1963 1966 and 2004 are included in the 0 05 and 0 95 quantile range whereas they are not included in the ga 12 the quantile results of the ga 31 which is the best fit model of the p covariate show a slight upward trend which is opposite to the trend of the amdf moreover the larger the quantile the smaller the fluctuation is and the weaker the ability to capture the extreme values compared to the previous two best fit models which may imply that precipitation is not the only cause for the changes in the amdf in other words in addition to precipitation the extreme flow in the djr basin may be influenced by other factors such as human activities 4 3 nonstationary modeling of the extreme flows the ranking of the performances of all nonstationary models based on the aic values table 11 indicates that the ga 35 with the mri and p as covariates for both the location and scale parameters is the best fit model followed by the ga 15 model that uses the mri and p and only considered in the location parameter the ga 33 and ga 13 are ranked 3rd and 4th respectively and both models use the mri as covariates the performances of the other models that use the p or ri or both as covariates are ranked behind the models that use the mri as covariates the performance of the stationary model ga 0 is ranked 12th among all models and there are four nonstationary models namely ga 22 ga 32 ga 24 and ga 21 that have worse performances than the stationary model with regard to the ranking of the best fit models for a single covariate the best fit model ga 33 for the mri covariate is ranked 2nd among all models whereas the best fit models that use the p and ri covariates namely ga 31 and ga 12 are ranked 6th and 11th respectively these three models have better performances than the stationary model the introduction of the mri in the nonstationary models results in more significant improvements in the model performance than the introduction of p or ri that is the mri has the greatest impact on the model performances followed by the p and ri with regard to the ranking of the best fit models with two or more covariates the ga 35 which is the best fit model with the p and mri as covariates for both the location and scale parameters is ranked 1st whereas the best fit model ga 34 with the p and ri as covariates is ranked 5th in addition the performances of these two models are not only superior to the performance of the stationary model but are also better than those in which a single physical process is used as a covariate the results imply that the changes in the amdf attributed to the effects of precipitation and reservoirs are much more realistic than those attributed only to the effects of the precipitation or the reservoirs that is the amdf is influenced by both the precipitation and the reservoirs but the latter is more significant fig 6 further shows the quantile results of the ga 35 and ga 34 the ga 35 is the best fit model that uses the p and mri as covariates and the ga 34 is the best fit model that uses the p and ri as covariates it is observed that the quantiles of these two models all show a downward trend which is in agreement with the trend of the amdf however the ability to capture the extreme values is greater for the ga 35 than for the ga 34 for example the extreme value in 1966 is included in the 0 05 and 0 95 quantile range in the ga 35 but the extreme value is not included in the same range of the ga 34 this means that the ability to explain the changes in the extreme flow is greater for the ga 35 that uses the p and mri as covariates than for the ga 34 that uses the p and ri as covariates in addition a comparison of the models that use both the p and mri or only the p as covariates indicates that the model s ability to capture the extreme values is significantly higher when the mri and the p are used as covariates than when only the p is used as a covariate indicating that the extreme flow in the djr basin is indeed impacted by the combined effects of precipitation and reservoirs 5 discussion 5 1 relationship between the amdf and precipitation fig 7 shows the results of the correlation analysis between the amdf and the p ri and mri it is observed that the amdf is significantly correlated with the p and mri and the correlation coefficients are significant at the 0 05 level the correlation between the amdf and ri does not pass the significance test at the 0 05 level however fig 2 and table 12 show that the amdf has a downward trend with a rate of 36 2 m³ s and passes the significance test at the 0 1 level whereas the precipitation has an upward trend though it is not significant at the 0 1 level this is opposite to the trend of the amdf wang et al 2008 pointed out that the effect of water reservoirs is the main reason for the inconsistency in the trends of runoff and precipitation that is precipitation is not the only factor affecting the amdf in the djr basin other factors such as reservoir construction also have large impacts on the runoff in the djr basin consequently the fitting of the nonstationary models is improved by increasing the number of factors that affect the amdf this is the main reason why the models that include the mri and p as covariates have better performances than the models that only use the mri or p as a covariate 5 2 influences of the reservoirs on extreme flows as mentioned in the introduction a large number of reservoirs have been constructed in the djr basin since the 1950s and up to 2006 896 reservoirs were built with a total capacity of 190 108 m³ in this basin zhang et al 2015 the xfj fsb and bpz are the three major large reservoirs in the djr basin with a total capacity up to 170 66 108 m³ table 1 accounting for approximately 90 of the total capacity of reservoirs in the djr basin and 70 of the annual runoff at boluo station in addition the total catchment area of the three reservoirs almost accounts for half of the catchment area of the djr basin this means that the three reservoirs have a considerable ability to regulate the runoff fig 8 shows the results of the mean daily inflow and outflow of the xfj reservoir from january 1 1961 to september 18 2010 and the data are provided by the hydrological bureau of guangdong province it can be seen from fig 8 a that the inflow has a very large range and a maximum value greater than 7000 m³ s 1964 06 15 whereas the outflow is flat and its maximum is less than 1250 m³ s 1983 06 19 fig 8 b shows the flood hydrograph before and after the regulation of the xfj reservoir for a specific flood event the flood hydrograph becomes rather flat after the xfj reservoir regulation and the peak flood is reduced sharply from 6777 2 m³ s to less than 500 m³ s which means that the reservoir has a large impact on the extreme flows in the djr basin wang 2007 also investigated the impacts of the xfj reservoir on the extreme flows in the drj basin the results showed that the flood peak at the heyuan gauge station fig 1 was reduced from 1570 m³ s to 6560 m³ s and the water level decreased from 1 47 to 4 96 m ye et al 2013 analyzed the frequency of the amdf at longchuan fig 1 a hydrological station at the downstream of the fsb reservoir in the djr basin the results showed that among the six flood events with an exceedance probability of less than 0 1 only one flood event occurred after the construction of the fsb reservoir 1973 the mean amdf was 2374 m³ s before the construction of the fsb reservoir and decreased to 1234 m³ s after the reservoir was built results of hydrological models also showed that the reservoirs had great impacts on the stream flow in the djr basin lai et al 2016 found that the fractional contribution of human activities to the increase of the streamflow ranged from 0 23 to 0 73 by using the elastic coefficient model lin et al 2012 identified the quantitative effect of climate change and human activity on runoff in the djr basin based on the soil conservation service scs model the results showed that the impacts due to climate change and human activity were half and half furthermore tu et al 2012 and ye et al 2013 pointed out that the construction of reservoirs was the main human activities resulting in the nonstationarity of the runoff especially for the extreme flows in the djr basin this further supports the findings in section 4 3 that the mri is more appropriate than the ri to show the impacts of reservoirs on the changes in the extreme flows and the construction of reservoirs is one of the main causes for the nonstatioanrity of extreme flows in addition due to the booming economy and increasing population the demand for water resources has increased significantly in the djr basin to meet the water demand in this region the government of guangdong province adjusted the function priority of the three major reservoirs in recent years the xfj reservoir was originally designed for power generation but its current purposes are flood control and water supply the major functions of the fsb reservoir are shipping and the reservoir is now mainly used for flood control and water supply similarly the major functions of the bpz reservoir have changed from flood control and irrigation to flood control and water supply the changes in the functions of the three reservoirs place more importance on the water supply which means that the effects of the regulation on the streamflow in the djr basin will increase in the future it should be pointed that except for precipitation and reservoirs there are other potential factors that impact the runoff in the djr basin such as urbanization ye et al 2013 thus additional explanatory variables should be taken into account in the nonstationary flood frequency analysis and quantitative analysis should be performed to determine their effects in future studies 5 3 the effect of exceptional events prosdocimi et al 2015 investigated the effects of influential points and found that if a leverage point was characterized greater by the rainfall variable than the urban variable the removal of the leverage point increased the significance of the urban variable in contrast if the leverage point was characterized greater by the urban variable than the rainfall variable removing the leverage point from the data set increased the significance of the rainfall variable however the results in fig 6 show that the extreme value in 1979 is outside the 0 05 to 0 95 quantile range although this extreme value is not the largest value in the amdf series and both the effects of precipitation and reservoir are considered in the model however some of the extreme values that are larger than the 1979 value are included in the same quantile range such as the extreme value in 1966 on the other hand the removal of the extreme value in 1979 does not increase the significance of the precipitation or the mri we investigated the cause of this phenomenon and found that the amdf in 1979 was mainly attributed to the flood event that occurred in the xizhijiang basin fig 1 which is a sub catchment of the djr basin note that the bpz reservoir was completed in 1983 and no other reservoirs exist in the section between the bpz reservoir and the boluo gauge station thus the effects of the reservoirs on the extreme flows are not reflected by the mri or ri in addition using the precipitation amount in the 7 days prior to the date of the amdf in the whole djr basin may not be appropriate to represent the flood events in a sub catchment in the djr basin moreover except for precipitation and reservoirs there may be other potential factors that are responsible for the changes of extreme flows such as land use change ye et al 2013 this is the main reason for the poor fit of the extreme value in 1979 6 conclusions in this study we modified the ri proposed by lópez and francés 2013 to investigate whether the changes in extreme flows can be attributed to the effects of reservoirs by using nonstationary flood frequency analyses based on the gamlss framework nonstationary flood frequency models were developed using the mri as a covariate and were used to fit the amdf at the boluo station in the djr basin that has been greatly impacted by reservoir construction our findings are summarized as follows the results show that the mri is a significant covariate for the extreme flow in the djr basin and its ability to show the effects of reservoir on the extreme flow can be reflected by introducing it as a covariate in the location parameter or both the location and scale parameters of the ga distribution whereas the ri is a significant variable for the extreme flow only when it is introduced in the scale parameter using the mri as a covariate results in greater performance improvements of the nonstationary models and a better ability to capture the extreme values than the use of the ri for fitting the amdf the mri is more practical and effective than the ri with regard to reflecting the changes in the extreme flows the effects of reservoir on extreme flows at the boluo station in the djr basin are significant and even greater than the effects of precipitation though the latter is usually regarded as the most important factor leading to the changes in extreme flows this implies that the effect of reservoir is one of the main causes for the nonstationarity of the extreme flow in the djr basin furthermore with the increasing demand for water resources and the function adjustment of the xfj fsb and bpz reservoirs the effects of reservoirs on extreme flows in the djr basin will increase in future the results also show that the performance of the nonstationary models is higher in most models when the covariates are introduced in the location parameter or both the location and scale parameters than in those using the same variables as covariates only in the scale parameter but in some cases the performance of the models introducing the covariates in the scale parameter is higher than those with the covariates introduced in the location parameter or both the location and scale parameters as presented in 4 2 section thus to consider all possible effects of the covariates on the nonstationarity of hydrological extremes it is necessary to use the physical processes as covariates in all model parameters acknowledgments the research is financially supported by national

701,subterranean estuary as a saltwater freshwater mixing zone in a coastal aquifer is significantly affected by tides while many studies have been conducted to examine the effects of tides on groundwater dynamics in subterranean estuaries in relation to submarine groundwater discharge and seawater intrusion the focus of the investigation particularly for those based on numerical modelling has been on tides with few frequencies e g monochromatic tide and spring neap tides bichromatic in this study we examine numerically effects of measured multi constituent tides on a coastal unconfined aquifer with the antecedent tidal conditions accounted for using the gamma distribution function we conducted regression analysis and quantified the effects of measured multi constituent tides on coastal unconfined aquifers in a prolonged and cumulative fashion the results showed that the response of submarine groundwater discharge to the tidal fluctuation is mostly instantaneous the coastal aquifer behaved like a low pass filter that smooths out high frequency tidal signals and leaves behind low frequency signals to affect upper saline plume and lower saltwater wedge the upper saline plume and lower saltwater wedge were significantly affected by antecedent tidal conditions at monthly and yearly time scales respectively sensitivity analysis showed that the low pass filter capacity can be altered by soil hydraulic conductivity and beach slope this study revealed the importance of antecedent tidal conditions for seawater intrusion and will help to improve our understanding of hydrological processes in natural coastal unconfined aquifers keywords submarine groundwater discharge seawater intrusion coastal aquifer numerical modeling density dependent flow 1 introduction

for detailed reviews among these factors tides are identified to play an important role in the two complementary processes sgd and swi in seaside aquifers in the absence of oceanic forces density contrast between lighter terrestrial freshwater and denser offshore saltwater often lead to the formation of a saltwater wedge in the seaside of an unconfined aquifer cooper 1959 glover 1959 inland fresh groundwater flows above the denser saltwater before discharging into the sea the saltwater wedge is actually a mixing zone rather than a sharp interface as hydrodynamic dispersion across the saltwater wedge causes salt to move into the freshwater zone driving convective recirculation which contributes to sgd destouni and prieto 2003 smith 2004 the location and variation of saltwater wedge are affected by inland freshwater input mean sea level and aquifer dispersivity smith 2004 werner et al 2013 overall a higher seaward hydraulic gradient would inhibit swi and lead to a seaward

certain conditions tides could lead to saltwater recirculation in the intertidal zone of shallow aquifers in addition to the traditional lower saltwater wedge fig 1 bakhtyar et al 2013 li and barry 2000 robinson et al 2007b xin et al 2010 this shallow recirculation labeled upper saline plume usp can represent a major portion of total sgd e g li et al 1999 li et al 2009 robinson et al 2007c

saltwater wedge at the seaside fig 1 tidal fluctuations can also enhance hydrodynamic diffusion and dispersion leading to a thick mixing zone of saltwater and freshwater robinson et al 2018 werner et al 2013 the response of subterranean estuary to bi chromatic spring neap tides has also been widely reported abarca et al 2013 buquet et al 2016 heiss and michael 2014 robinson et al 2007a the water exchange across the aquifer ocean interface increase from the small amplitude neap to large amplitude spring tide leading to enhanced freshwater and saltwater mixing over a spring neap tidal cycle

lagged behind tidal variations in comparison the location of lower saltwater wedge is less variable heiss and michael 2014 in natural systems tidal fluctuations with multiple constituents frequencies powers and phases are common e g solar semi diurnal s2 principle lunar semidiurnal m2 solar diurnal s1 and lunar diurnal o1 when tides propagate into an aquifer these multi constituent signals interact and lead to complicated groundwater table fluctuations and salt distributions abarca et al 2013 elad et al 2017 geng and boufadel 2017 it is recognized that aquifers behavior like a filter removing out high frequency signals and leaving low frequency signals in groundwater fluctuations li et al 2000 taniguchi 2002 amplitudes of these frequencies are gradually attenuated with increased horizontal distance from shoreline li et al 2000 mao et al 2006 parlange et al 1984 the groundwater fluctuations of nearby aquifer are found to lag behind tidal fluctuations in field investigations carr and der kamp 1969 and analytical solutions li et al 2000 parlange et al 1984 spectrum analysis on time series data is adopted to discover this complexity incorporated in field investigations elad et al 2017 geng and boufadel 2017 kobayashi et al 2017 taniguchi et al 2002 but the findings are diverse for example taniguchi 2002 found three different dominant tidal frequencies in the sgd variations under the complicated boundary conditions including the varied terrestrial freshwater and rainfall infiltration field investigations from elad et al 2017 suggested that groundwater levels and salinity fluctuations captured five dominant frequencies of the tide signals in the israeli coastal aquifer field observation of kobayashi et al 2017 indicated the diurnal and semidiurnal frequencies in sgd flux resemble the seawater fluctuation for field investigations it is easy to measure groundwater table fluctuations however monitoring salinity distributions groundwater flows and water exchange across the aquifer sea interface e g sgd are relatively difficult and non trivial burnett et al 2006 given this numerical modellings were conducted to provide insight into additional processes and enhance understanding of observed results geng and boufadel 2015b guo et al 2010 heiss and michael 2014 robinson et al 2007a synthetic tidal signals with principle components are fitted from observed tidal variations and then used to set up boundary conditions of numerical models the used curve fitting is essentially a smoothing process based on weighted least squares regression geng and boufadel 2015b heiss and michael 2014 robinson et al 2007a the purpose of using fitted synthetic tides are two fold 1 it was argued that the measured tide data could not be directly simulated as a continuous signal was required to run the model to reach a quasi steady state geng and boufadel 2015b heiss and michael 2014 robinson et al 2007a the simulation time required at timescale of hundreds of days is often larger than the observation period and 2 it simplifies the data analysis and captures the fundamental effect of tides on coastal aquifers while the above mentioned studies have revealed the complexity of tidal effects question remains unclear how measured multi constituent tidal signals affect the sgd and swi behaviors in a subterranean estuary different from the fitted synthetic tidal signals measured multi constituent tides would lead to a non periodic boundary condition and requires long term field investigations and numerical simulations to capture the continued response of the groundwater dynamics to tidal conditions given such a case a quasi steady state may not exist complicating the quantitative analysis based upon a series of companion papers robinson et al 2014 xin et al 2010 2014 2015 yu et al 2017 this paper examined the effect of measured multi constituent tides on sgd and swi in a subterranean estuary we conducted numerical simulations based on a well validated model with both measured multi constituent and fitted synthetic tidal conditions set as the seaside boundary conditions through comparison we examined both long term and short term effects of measured multi constituent tides on sgd and swi in a subterranean estuary we conducted regression analysis and quantified the effect of measured multi constituent tides on the variation of salinity distribution in a prolonged and cumulative fashion 2 conceptual and numerical model it should be noted that a subterranean estuary affected by measured multi constituent tides is in non equilibrium as it is continuously adjusting to the effects of previous tidal conditions which is not fully periodic unfortunately uncovering this long term effect incorporated in natural systems is challenging as it needs to monitor both oceanic and underground processes over a long duration hundreds of days as suggested by xin et al 2014 in comparison numerical modelling is readily achievable as done in this paper the model domain and parameter values were based on the conditions of a field site on the west coast of moreton island australia robinson et al 2006 similar to a series of papers robinson et al 2014 xin et al 2010 2014 2015 yu et al 2017 we considered here a 2 d vertical cross shore section of a nearshore unconfined aquifer fig 1 to focus on tidal effects we excluded waves rainfall and evaporation the aquifer was assumed homogeneous and isotropic and the groundwater flow and solute transport were negligible in the alongshore direction similar to our previous papers robinson et al 2014 xin et al 2010 2014 2015 yu et al 2017 the simulations were conducted based on sutra which simulates variably saturated and density dependent pore water flow and associated solute transport voss and provost 2008 in sutra the pore water flow is described by richards equation richards 1931 and soil saturation is calculated based on the van genuchten 1980 formulas see details in xin et al 2010 in this paper boundary ab was set to inland boundary with a fixed freshwater influx at 2 1 m3 m d boundaries af bc and cd were set to no flow boundary boundary def is the aquifer ocean interface linked to the tidal water in specific we considered the following tidal conditions fig 2 note that the elapsed days were referred to the beginning of year 2015 tide m real tide data measured

tidal level were respectively 1 53 and 1 35 m to identify the effect of low power tidal constituents on the subterranean estuary and uncover interactions among dominant tidal constituents we also conducted simulations with fitted synthetic tidal signals as done in previous studies geng and boufadel 2015b heiss and michael 2014 robinson et al 2007a the synthetic tidal signals were fitted using the equation as follows 1 h t h m s l i 1 n a i cos ω i t φ i where h t l is the tidal level at time t l hmsl is the mean sea level l ai is the amplitude of tide constituent i l ω i is the tidal angular frequency t 1 and ϕ i is the phase shift based on eq 1 we fitted out two synthetic tidal signals with different numbers of harmonics as follows tide 4 synthetic tides with four harmonic constituents m2 s2 k1 n2 the fitted amplitudes for these four constituents were respectively 0 73 0 19 0 19 and 0 15 m the phases were respectively 2 00 5 37 0 71 and 3 48 the highest and lowest tidal level were respectively 1 22 and 1 25 m the goodness of fitting was determined by adjusted r 2 at the value of 0 94 tide 2 synthetic tides with two harmonic constituents m2 s2 adjust r 2 0 86 their amplitudes were respectively 0 73 0 19 m with the phases of 2 00 and 5 37 the highest and lowest tidal level were respectively 0 92 and 0 92 m it is clear that from tide m to tide 4 and tide 2 the low power tidal constituents were gradually removed and the maximum tidal range was reduced from 2 88 m to 2 47 and 1 84 m fig 2 and table 1 we also calculated the averaged tidal level and standard deviation reflects the intensity of the tidal fluctuations of tidal levels over each principal lunar semi diurnal tidal cycle 12 42 h with less tidal constituents the variations of the averaged tidal level and standard deviation of tidal fluctuations every 12 42 h decreased note these two induces will be used for quantifying the sgd and swi later in this paper we focused on an aquifer similar to those used in previous studies robinson et al 2014 xin et al 2010 2014 2015 yu et al 2017 the model setup was based on a sandy beach with hydraulic conductivity ks 10 m d porosity ϕ 0 45 longitudinal dispersivity αl 0 5 m and transverse dispersivity αt 0 05 m carsel and parrish 1988 the residual water saturation swres was set to 0 1 while water retention parameters α and n was set to 14 5 m 1 and 2 68 for van genuchten 1980 formulas results in sections 3 1 to 3 3 to generalize the results we also conducted the sensitivity analysis on soil hydraulic conductivity and beach slope in the former simulation series the soil hydraulic conductivity was varied from ks 5 m d to ks 10 m d and ks 15 m d other parameters unchanged results in section 3 4 for the latter simulation series we allowed the beach slope ef in fig 1 to change from 1 10 to 1 12 5 and 1 15 in this way the model domain was changed accordingly other parameters were same as the base case with results presented in section 3 5 this model was run with a time step of 300 s for all the simulations note that the measured tide data at a 600 s interval were interpolated to generate input tidal data for the model further details such as mesh generation and setup of the tidal boundary conditions can be found in xin et al 2010 it is worth noting that this model has been validated against laboratory and field investigations kuan et al 2012 robinson et al 2006 xin et al 2010 and have been used for simulating groundwater dynamics and salt transport in the same model configuration subjected to tides waves and rainfall robinson et al 2014 xin et al 2010 2014 2015 yu et al 2017 3 results and analysis 3 1 long term effect of tides on sgd and swi in this paper we assume that the subterranean estuary is at a non equilibrium the model was run with six year tidal fluctuations but our analysis focuses on the last two years year 2015 2016 as suggested by robinson et al 2007b and xin et al 2010 the four year period prior to the analysis has spanned out the memory of the system with respect to both hydraulic heads and salinity distribution e g the behavior of the subterranean estuary might be affected by tidal conditions in year 2011 2014 but not those before firstly we examined the averaged results over the last two years year 2015 2016 we calculated per unit width fluxes across the aquifer ocean interface induced by tides and density we also calculated the salt mass stored in respectively the usp smusp and lower saltwater wedge smsw note that only the area of x 20 m was considered as seawater occupied the area for x 20 m table 1 it is worth noting that we calculated the salt mass stored in usp and lower saltwater wedge using the 5 isochlor of the saltwater salinity to separate the two saline zones mostly the 5 isochlor separated the usp and lower saltwater wedge sometimes the two saline bodies merged slightly in this case we adopted the local minimum salinity to separate them the measured multi constituent tides tide m led to the biggest tide induced circulating flux 1 46 m3 m d per unit width aquifer in comparison with the four constituent tides 1 25 m3 m d tide 4 and the two constituent tides 1 12 m3 m d tide 2 this was attributed to the reduced maximum tidal range from tide m to tide 4 and tide 2 from 2 88 m to 2 47 and 1 84 m fig 2 and table 1 in comparison the density driven flux didn t change so much as a sum of the inland freshwater input fixed at 2 1 m3 m d in all the simulations and the total circulating flux both tide induced and density driven the total sgd decreased with reduced tidal constituents suggesting that tide 4 and tide 2 with reduced tidal constituents under predicted the tidal contribution to the total sgd table 1 consistently tide m generated the biggest usp in the shallow aquifer fig 3 from the tide m case to the tide 4 and tide 2 cases the salt mass stored in the usp reduced from 872 to 684 22 reduction and 527 kg m 40 reduction this clearly showed that the synthetic tides with limited tidal constituents would under predict the tide induced usp and predicted biased salinity distribution in the shallow aquifer as the usp contracted and tide induced circulating flux decreased the lower saltwater wedge intruded further landward in the tide 4 and tide 2 cases however the change is not apparent with respect to the location of the toe and the salt mass stored in the lower saltwater wedge fig 3 and table 1 secondly we examined the per unit area water and salt fluxes across the aquifer ocean interface fig 4 both the zones for water and salt influxes contracted seawards x 15 m to x 5 m with reduced tidal constituents this was caused by the decreased tidal fluctuations during spring tides and consistent with the previous studies robinson et al 2007a an intensive inundation can induce significant saltwater infiltration in the shallow aquifer with the maximum tidal range under fitted tide 4 and tide 2 underestimated the influx zone tide m also led to the shift of water and salt efflux zone x 5 m to x 10 m towards the sea figs 3 and 4 3 2 short term effects of tides on sgd and swi in this section we examined the instantaneous behavior of the subterranean estuary over the last two years year 2015 2016 response to the dynamic tidal fluctuations the instantaneous water efflux sgd across the per unit width aquifer ocean interface varied dramatically fig 5 it is hard to see any apparent difference among different cases from both instantaneous results and averaged results over each 12 42 h we didn t detect any time lag between the sgd and tides peaks in fig 5d and e in comparison with those in fig 2d and e this suggested that the present sgd seemed to be affected by present tidal conditions rather than those antecedent however tide m tide 4 and tide 2 all led to apparent changes in the salinity distribution reflected by instantaneous salt mass stored in the usp smusp and lower saltwater wedge smsw figs 6 and 7 for the tide 2 case both smusp and smsw fluctuated periodically following a spring neap tidal cycle within the principal lunar semi diurnal cycle 12 42 h the variation was minor consistent with the previous studies heiss and michael 2014 robinson et al 2007a this clearly demonstrated that the aquifer filtered out high frequency tidal signals with further tidal constituents included in the tide 4 and tide m cases the overall smusp increased but smsw decreased for smusp of the tide m and tide 4 cases monthly periodic oscillations 27 3 d appeared and the fluctuation range max smusp min smusp over the two years increased in comparison with that of the tide 2 case i e 463 and 309 compared with 170 kg m the variation of smsw became more complicated particularly in the tide m case it was hard to see any periodic variation either of spring neap tidal cycle or monthly instead a yearly periodic oscitation clearly demonstrated 365 d note this didn t occur in the tide 4 case to uncover the behavior of the sgd and swi variations we conducted spectral analysis using fast fourier transfer fft the sampling size and sampling frequency utilized in fft are 8760 and 1 7200 hz i e the data was analyzed with consideration of the two year data with the time interval of 2 h in the spectral analysis we used the following standardized variables x and thus the amplitudes mentioned below were non dimensional the maximum minimum and mean values are listed in table 1 2 x x mean x max x min x as set up in the simulation cases high amplitude peaks were found at the frequencies of 2 24 10 5 2 31 10 5 1 16 10 5 and 2 19 10 5 hz for tidal fluctuations in the tide m and tide 4 cases fig 8 a those frequencies were respectively consistent with the m2 s2 k1 and n2 tides for the tide m case principal lunar semi diurnal m2 dominated the fluctuation with a contribution of 7 low frequency spanned from 10 8 to 10 5 hz reflecting the long period fluctuations involved in the measured tidal signals spectrogram of the sgd was overall similar to that of tides with respect to frequencies those frequencies associated with the m2 s2 k1 and n2 fig 8b tidal frequencies clearly existed in the tide m and tide 4 cases the m2 frequency with the amplitude of 0 27 was also the biggest component three times larger than the sum of those related to the other three dominant frequencies it was interesting that for the three cases a frequency of 7 83 10 7 hz corresponding to a period of 14 8 d i e a spring neap tidal period appeared furthermore a frequency of 4 24 10 7 hz corresponding to a period of 27 3 d appeared in the tide m and tide 4 cases but not in the tide 2 case this suggested that the sgd was affected by the interaction of tidal constituents more tidal constituents liked to generate more low frequency oscillations nevertheless the contribution of these low frequency variations to sgd was minor in our simulation cases the spectrograms of the smusp and smsw were remarkably different from those for the tides and sgd fig 8c and d four dominated frequencies in tide signals disappeared and high amplitude peaks appeared in the low frequency zones for smusp of the tide m and tide 4 cases high power peaks 0 12 0 09 and 0 09 for the tide m case 0 06 0 16 and 0 14 for the tide 4 case were found at the frequencies of 6 50 10 8 4 24 10 7 and 7 83 10 7 hz these frequencies respectively consistent with the periods of 178 1 27 3 and 14 8 d in comparison a spring neap tidal cycle with a period of 14 8 d clearly dominated in the tide 2 case we tested different combinations among the high frequency signals the results showed that the spring neap tidal cycle with a frequency of 7 83 10 7 hz was generated by the combination of m2 and s2 tidal constituents f s2 f m2 the signal with a frequency of 4 24 10 7 hz was generated by the combination of m2 and n2 tidal constituents f m2 f n2 the signal with a frequency of 6 50 10 8 hz was generated by the combination of m2 s2 and n2 tidal constituents 3f m2 2f n2 f s2 for smsw the amplitudes corresponding with 4 24 10 7 and 7 83 10 7 hz were much lower in the tide m case in comparison with the tide 4 and tide 2 cases instead a low frequency corresponding with a period of 365 d became to dominate in smsw that was apparently different from those of the tide 4 and tide 2 cases this yearly fluctuation contributed 14 4 to the smsw of the tide m case overall tidal signals interacted when propagating into aquifers and led to low frequency variations for all the results no apparent high frequency variations were caused by the interaction among tidal constituents this filtering effect was gradually intensified from sgd to smusp and smsw it could be imagined that the synthetic tides with low amplitude and low frequency signals excluded are unable to reproduce low frequency behavior of a subterranean estuary particularly the movement of lower saltwater wedge 3 3 quantification of the sgd and swi affected by measured multi constituent tides the filtering effect discussed above reflected that the sgd and swi behaviours responded to the varying tidal conditions in different fashions the subterranean estuary behaved as a band pass filter that passes frequencies within a certain range and attenuated frequencies outside that range furthermore combinations among high frequency signals tended to generate low frequency signals to explore and quantify this behavior we tested a series of regression models with the goodness of fitting quantified by adjusted r 2 as it was hard to quantify the instantaneous variations dominated by the m2 frequency we focused on running averaged results over each m2 tidal cycle 12 42 h in this section we focused on the tide m case with measured tide data firstly we tested a simultaneous linear regression with no consideration of possible effects of antecedent tidal conditions as follows 3 y a 0 a σ x σ a m x m e where y is the dependent value x σ and xm are the independent values respectively being the standard variation of tidal level and averaged tidal level over each lunar semi diurnal tidal cycle 12 42 h note that the two variables quantify tidal fluctuations over the tidal cycle with the former related to the tidal range and the latter indicating the averaged sea level a with subscripts are the coefficients of the regression model and e represents the error this model applied through optimization by adjusting the coefficients fitted the averaged sgd to a certain extent adjusted r 2 at 0 60 table 2 and figs 9 a and 10 a note that the addition of higher order terms would lead to improvement of fitting but in the same time it would lead to a regression model at a high level of complexity in the paper we focused on simple first order regressions so that the processes quantified would be readily understood as expected eq 3 failed to match the simulated salinity distribution smusp and smsw pre dominated by low frequencies we then hypothesized that the salinity distribution was affected by both present and antecedent tidal conditions similar to xin et al 2014 and yu et al 2017 we explored an approach based on functional data analysis fda ramsay and silverman 2005 which considered antecedent tidal conditions in a continuous and smooth function at a temporal scale to quantify the cumulative effect of the independent values x σ and xm we hypothesized that they can be weighted in the form of the following convolution 4 d t l i j n m ζ i j x i t j δ t j n m ζ i j where dtli is the parametric regressors i e the weighted tidal conditions combined in a cumulative fashion the subscript i indicates the independent value σ and m are respectively for the standard variation of tidal level and averaged tidal level over 12 42 h t is the present time t jδt is the given past time with δt being the increment set to 12 42 h as the averaged results were used for the analysis x i t jδt is the variable at that time the minimum and maximum values of j are respectively n and m which define the past time period considered ζ i j is a time dependent weighting factor described by a gamma distribution of the following probability density function pdf 5 ζ i j g a m m a α i β i j δ t β i α i 1 γ α i j δ t α i 1 e x p β i j δ t where α i and β i are respectively the shape and scale factors the ratio αi βi is the mathematical expectation mean of gamma distribution pdf which controls the tail of the distribution it should be noted that we chose gamma distribution function because it is flexible in providing weighting of different characteristics it is a combination of power and exponential functions and can be non monotonic if α 1 and has the advantage of characterizing the delayed and prolonged effect recently gamma distribution function is widely used to describe flow and solute transport in various hydrological systems kirchner et al 2000 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 xin et al 2014 yu et al 2017 furthermore the gamma distribution has no value at zero i e required that jδt 0 in this study we set n and m respectively to 1 and 1411 two years and thus eq 5 does not consider the effect of the present tidal conditions in this way the model considered the tidal conditions in the two antecedent years that is for fitting the aquifer behavior in year 2015 2016 the tidal variations in year 2013 2014 were considered we then explored how the averaged smusp and smsw might be related to dtl σ and or dtlm as discussed earlier a signal with a frequency of 6 50 10 8 hz period of 178 1 d appeared in smusp this new signal was generated by the combination of m2 s2 and n2 tidal constituents 3f m2 2f n2 f s2 and did not appear in either x σ or xm variations see the spectrograms in fig s1 of supplementary material for smusp we considered both the antecedent tidal conditions dtl σ and a new sinusoidal signal and finally adopted the following regression model 6 y a 0 a σ d t l σ a a sin ω t δ e where ω is the angular frequency related to the low frequency of 6 50 10 8 hz aa and δ are the amplitude and the phase shift of the new signal respectively for smsw we considered the antecedent tidal conditions dtl σ and dtlm and finally adopted the following regression model 7 y a 0 a σ d t l σ a m d t l m e the tidal fluctuations induced water and associated salt exchange across the aquifer sea interface leading to a varying usp the regression model eq 6 well fit the magnitude of the smusp variations adjusted r 2 at 0 86 fig 9b and captured the trend with respect to the peaks fig 10b this was well consistent with the spectral analysis that the smusp variations were affected by antecedent tidal conditions the fitting led to the determination of the α i and β j values which was consistent with a monotonic gamma distribution pdf α i 0 92 less than 1 suggesting that the past tidal effect on smusp decay immediately fig 11 a and table 2 however the past tidal effect reflected by standard variation was prolonged it was clear that the condition before 50 d still affected the present smusp smsw was examined subsequently with the both dtl σ and dtlm considered eq 7 fitted it to a high level of goodness adjusted r 2 at 0 95 fig 9c it can be seen it captured both the magnitude and trend of the simulated smsw fig 10c this fitting led to the determination of the two sets of α i and β j values it was very interesting that the dtl for the averaged sea level was consistent with a monotonic gamma distribution pdf α i 0 76 less than 1 suggesting that the past effect of averaged sea level on the smsw decay immediately fig 11b and table 2 however the dtl for the standard variation was consistent with a non monotonic gamma distribution pdf α i 1 80 large than 1 fig 11b and table 2 this suggested that the effect of varying tidal range was delayed the maximum impact occurred on day 28 being quantified by the mean of gamma distribution pdf αi βi smsw was more significantly affected by antecedent tidal fluctuations table 2 the values went up to 65 49 and 74 73 days respectively for the standard variation of tidal level and averaged tidal level it can be seen from fig 11b almost yearlong antecedent sea levels affected the present smsw in summary the results suggest that the sgd was altered by present tidal conditions but smusp and smsw were controlled by the antecedent tidal fluctuations smusp was sensitive to the fluctuation intensity over each lunar semi diurnal tidal cycle smsw responded to tidal fluctuations slowly and was affected by both the fluctuation amplitude and averaged sea level 3 4 importance of soil hydraulic conductivity in addition to the tide m case two additional simulation cases with the soil hydraulic conductivity ks set to 5 and 15 m d with other parameters unchanged were conducted here we focused on the salinity distributions which were affected by the low pass filtering capacity of the aquifer system as expected a bigger hydraulic conductivity led to an overall larger usp fig s2 in supplementary material as ks increased from 5 to 10 and 15 m d the averaged smusp over year 2015 2016 increased from 430 to 872 and 1080 kg m in this study the inland boundary was flux fixed and a bigger hydraulic conductivity would lead to an overall reduced horizontal hydraulic gradient as such the sw intruded further landward the averaged smsw over year 2015 2016 increased from 5368 to 8425 and 10 652 kg m as ks increased from 5 to 10 and 15 m d we also calculated the running averaged results of smusp and smsw over each m2 tidal cycle 12 42 h fig 12 and fitted them using eqs 6 and 7 respectively overall the regression models well fitted the smusp and smsw variations tables 3 and 4 figs s3 6 in supplementary material the parameters determinated by the fitting for smusp table 3 clearly showed the importance of ks the coefficient a σ increased significantly from 1216 to 2862 and 4441 kg m2 as ks increased from 5 to 10 and 15 m d respectively in contrast the coefficient aa amplitude of the sinusoidal signal varied slightly the ratio of a σ to aa increased from 24 5 to 44 6 and 79 2 respectively this suggested that the contribution of dtl σ was significantly enhanced in affecting smusp as ks increased furthermore as ks increased from 5 to 10 and 15 m d the related probability density function became flat reflecting the increased weight of long dated forcing conditions fig 13 a consistently ασ βσ increased from 12 08 to 13 69 and 17 83 d respectively suggesting an enhanced effect of antecedent tidal fluctuations i e the present smusp recorded more past tidal conditions the smsw variations were affected by both the standard variation of tidal level and averaged tidal level table 4 for all the three simulation cases with different ks values the contribution of the two played competing roles the coefficient a σ for dtl σ took negative values but am for dtlm took positive values table 4 as ks increased from 5 to 10 and 15 m d the a σ value decreased from 4415 to 9321 and 12 580 kg m2 respectively however am increased from 3491 to 4043 and 4320 kg m2 respectively table 4 clearly the contribution of dtl σ played an increasingly predominant role as ks increased the mean values of the associated gamma distribution of both the standard variation of tidal level and averaged tidal level decreased as ks increased table 4 suggesting that the present smsw recorded less effect of past tidal conditions consistently the two associated probability density functions became steeper reflecting the increased weight of recent forcing conditions fig 13b and c 3 5 importance of beach slope in addition to the tide m case with the 1 10 beach slope two additional simulation cases with the beach slope set to 1 12 5 and 1 15 were conducted note the horizontal distance of beach was expanded to 75 and 90 m respectively the other parameters were unchanged as the tidal conditions were the same a reduced beach slope led to an extended intertidal zone and an expanded usp fig s7 in supplementary material as the beach slope decreased from 1 10 to 1 12 5 and 1 15 the averaged smusp over year 2015 2016 increased from 872 to 1145 and 1408 kg m respectively however the averaged salt mass decreased from 8425 to 7792 to 7291 kg m respectively eqs 6 and 7 also well fitted the running averaged results of smusp and smsw over each m2 tidal cycle fig 14 respectively tables 3 and 4 figs s8 11 in supplementary material from the parameter values determinated by the fitting for the smusp table 3 it can be seen that the coefficient a σ increased significantly from 2 862 to 4 044 and 5 333 kg m2 as the beach slope decreased from 1 10 to 1 12 5 and 1 15 respectively in the meantime the coefficient aa amplitude of the sinusoidal signal also increased from 64 13 to 90 27 and 121 70 kg m2 respectively the ratio of a σ to aa changed slightly from 44 6 to 44 8 and 43 8 respectively suggesting that the interaction among m2 s2 and n2 tidal constituents kept increasing following the trend of dtl σ furthermore as the beach slope decreased the related probability density function became flat reflecting the increased weight of long dated forcing conditions fig 15 a consistently ασ βσ increased from 13 69 to 18 65 and 24 85 d as the beach slope decreased from 1 10 to 1 12 5 and 1 15 respectively this suggested that the more mildly sloping beach enhanced the effect of antecedent tidal fluctuations on smusp overall the smsw variations were affected by competing effects of the standard variation of tidal level and averaged tidal level similar to that discussed in section 3 4 table 4 as the beach slope decreased from 1 10 to 1 12 5 and 1 15 the ratio of a σ to am changed slightly from 2 3 to 2 1 and 2 5 respectively suggesting that the contributions of dtl σ and dtlm were not significantly altered however the mean values of the associated gamma distribution of the standard variation of tidal level and averaged tidal level showed different trends ασ βσ increased from 65 49 to 66 24 and 68 76 d however αm βm decreased from 74 73 to 70 67 and 68 54 respectively as the beach slope decreased from 1 10 to 1 12 5 and 1 15 the associated probability density functions also changed in the opposite directions the one for the standard variation of tidal level became flatter fig 15b but the one for the averaged tidal level became steeper fig 15c this reflected an enhanced effect of usp which was mainly altered by the standard variation of tidal level a more mildly sloping beach led to a larger usp which recorded more past tidal conditions this modification in turn affected the lower saltwater wedge and weakened the impact from the averaged tidal level 4 discussions field investigations observed groundwater and salinity variations in tidally influenced subterranean estuaries by using of boreholes and buried sensors and measure the small scale sgd with the seepage meter abarca et al 2013 geng and boufadel 2015b guo et al 2010 mao et al 2006 robinson et al 2007a taniguchi 2002 these investigations found that the coastal groundwater fluctuations and sgd flux response to the tidal fluctuations in which the frequencies of tidal constituents are discovered our simulation results were well consistent with these field investigations suggesting that the sgd process is simultaneous with the present tidal variations rather than the antecedent variations in this paper the inland freshwater discharge rate was fixed and the sgd variation was mainly caused by seawater recirculation the simultaneous sgd response suggested that both seawater and associated nutrients entering the seaside subterranean estuary is mainly affected by present tidal conditions the simulation results also showed that salt distribution in the shallow aquifer represented by the size of usp considerably response to spring neap tidal fluctuations in comparison with that subjected to semi diurnal or diurnal tides this was consistent with the reported field investigation on sandy beaches heiss and michael 2014 robinson et al 2007a the response of the lower saltwater wedge was much sluggish in agreement with heiss and michael 2014 usp is often with faster flow rates and shorter residence times in comparison with lower saltwater wedge robinson et al 2007b as chemical compositions e g dissolved oxygen and ph of recirculating seawater and discharging fresh groundwater are apparently different a quick response of usp to tides would enhance freshwater seawater mixing and biogeochemical reaction in a subterranean estuary the regression results suggested that salinity distribution was significantly affected by antecedent tidal conditions this was consistent with the results from our previous studies on waves and rainfalls robinson et al 2014 xin et al 2014 2015 yu et al 2017 which suggested that the unconfined aquifer continually adjust the salinity distribution in response to the forcing condition in a cumulative fashion it could be expected that an aquifer system was unable to maintain an equilibrium state with a non periodic inland and or seaward forcing conditions the salinity distribution such as usp in the shallow aquifer response to the forcing condition in a prolonged fashion the size of usp would then combined with averaged sea level to alter the lower saltwater wedge kuan et al 2012 robinson et al 2007b xin et al 2010 in this way the lower saltwater wedge recorded the antecedent tidal fluctuations over a remarkably long period the usp appeared in the shallow aquifer and its maximum impact on the lower saltwater wedge was delayed therefore long term observations are necessary for the tidally influenced coastal aquifers observation of the forcing conditions could be made and considered to interpret the present salinity distributions single frequency monochromatic tides and bi chromatic spring neap tides have been widely used in previous modelling studies to uncover fundamental effect of tides on subterranean estuaries see review of robinson et al 2018 the simple tidal conditions are easy to setup in numerical models and simplifies the result analysis however numerical simulations used to reproduce field conditions should consider the measured real tidal fluctuations which are often with many constituents according to our results the fluctuation range over the spring tidal period played an important role in altering the circulating sgd and the size of usp fitted synthetic tides with the under fitted tidal range during spring tides would under predict sgd and the size of usp high frequency signals tend to interact in the aquifer and generate low frequency signals these low frequency signals together with low frequency signals already in the tidal fluctuations would jointly affect the long term salinity distribution in the aquifer nevertheless setting up fitted synthetic tides depends on modelling goals to simulate the sgd variations fitted synthetic tides could include high frequency signals as the response of sgd to tides is simultaneous in nature these high frequency signals e g solar semi diurnal s2 principle lunar semidiurnal m2 solar diurnal s1 and lunar diurnal o1 tend to have high powers and are expected to be identified by curve fitting used in the previous studies to simulate the swi processes low frequency signals such as seasonal variation would become important and could not be excluded low frequency tidal signals would affect the overall horizontal hydraulic gradient between inland freshwater and seawater and thus affect both usp and lower saltwater wedge particularly in long time scale robinson et al 2018 werner et al 2013 the intensity of filtering effect reflects the dependence of present status on the past conditions from our examination a long term dependence likely filtered the high frequency variation in the past this was apparently demonstrated by the lower saltwater wedge which captured the year long antecedent tidal fluctuations this cumulative antecedent effect led to a smooth variation without high frequency oscillations a quantitative analysis on the behavior of a subterranean estuary could attempt to build up relationship between the present status and antecedent forcing conditions the functional data analysis as done in this paper could be a useful way to weigh the prolonged and cumulative effect of antecedent forcing conditions 5 conclusions this paper has examined numerically the sgd and swi behaviors in a typical unconfined aquifer subjected to measured multi constituent tides with the antecedent tidal conditions accounted for using the gamma distribution function regression models were developed to quantify the associated sgd and swi behaviors from the present study the following conclusions can be drawn 1 coastal aquifer likely filters out high frequency tidal signals such as those of the m2 s2 k1 and n2 tides and leave behind low frequency signals to affect the upper saline plume and lower saltwater wedge furthermore high frequency signals tend to interact in the aquifer and generate low frequency signals these low frequency signals jointly affect the long term behavior of the aquifer 2 upper saline plume and lower saltwater wedge are significantly affected by antecedent tidal conditions based on our results salinity distribution in the shallow usp and deep saltwater wedge aquifer were affected by antecedent tidal conditions at monthly and yearly time scales respectively 3 effect of antecedent tidal conditions are moderated by soil hydraulic conductivity and beach slope based on our results with a flux fixed inland boundary a larger soil hydraulic conductivity would enhance the effect of antecedent tidal conditions on usp but reduce that on saltwater wedge a more mildly sloping beach would enhance the effect of antecedent tidal conditions on usp which in turn affects the lower saltwater wedge this paper focused on tides and excluded waves rainfall and inland freshwater variations all these forcing factors are likely to be irregular and thus lead to a more complicated subterranean estuary we considered here a two dimensional homogeneous and isotropic aquifer and yet aquifer heterogeneity and anisotropy under natural conditions would complicate further the processes in the subterranean estuary the inland boundary condition was flux specified in this paper it remains uncertain if the results are applicable to those head specified these additional factors should be examined in future investigations to explore further the complexity of subterranean estuaries acknowledgements this

701,subterranean estuary as a saltwater freshwater mixing zone in a coastal aquifer is significantly affected by tides while many studies have been conducted to examine the effects of tides on groundwater dynamics in subterranean estuaries in relation to submarine groundwater discharge and seawater intrusion the focus of the investigation particularly for those based on numerical modelling has been on tides with few frequencies e g monochromatic tide and spring neap tides bichromatic in this study we examine numerically effects of measured multi constituent tides on a coastal unconfined aquifer with the antecedent tidal conditions accounted for using the gamma distribution function we conducted regression analysis and quantified the effects of measured multi constituent tides on coastal unconfined aquifers in a prolonged and cumulative fashion the results showed that the response of submarine groundwater discharge to the tidal fluctuation is mostly instantaneous the coastal aquifer behaved like a low pass filter that smooths out high frequency tidal signals and leaves behind low frequency signals to affect upper saline plume and lower saltwater wedge the upper saline plume and lower saltwater wedge were significantly affected by antecedent tidal conditions at monthly and yearly time scales respectively sensitivity analysis showed that the low pass filter capacity can be altered by soil hydraulic conductivity and beach slope this study revealed the importance of antecedent tidal conditions for seawater intrusion and will help to improve our understanding of hydrological processes in natural coastal unconfined aquifers keywords submarine groundwater discharge seawater intrusion coastal aquifer numerical modeling density dependent flow 1 introduction

for detailed reviews among these factors tides are identified to play an important role in the two complementary processes sgd and swi in seaside aquifers in the absence of oceanic forces density contrast between lighter terrestrial freshwater and denser offshore saltwater often lead to the formation of a saltwater wedge in the seaside of an unconfined aquifer cooper 1959 glover 1959 inland fresh groundwater flows above the denser saltwater before discharging into the sea the saltwater wedge is actually a mixing zone rather than a sharp interface as hydrodynamic dispersion across the saltwater wedge causes salt to move into the freshwater zone driving convective recirculation which contributes to sgd destouni and prieto 2003 smith 2004 the location and variation of saltwater wedge are affected by inland freshwater input mean sea level and aquifer dispersivity smith 2004 werner et al 2013 overall a higher seaward hydraulic gradient would inhibit swi and lead to a seaward

certain conditions tides could lead to saltwater recirculation in the intertidal zone of shallow aquifers in addition to the traditional lower saltwater wedge fig 1 bakhtyar et al 2013 li and barry 2000 robinson et al 2007b xin et al 2010 this shallow recirculation labeled upper saline plume usp can represent a major portion of total sgd e g li et al 1999 li et al 2009 robinson et al 2007c

saltwater wedge at the seaside fig 1 tidal fluctuations can also enhance hydrodynamic diffusion and dispersion leading to a thick mixing zone of saltwater and freshwater robinson et al 2018 werner et al 2013 the response of subterranean estuary to bi chromatic spring neap tides has also been widely reported abarca et al 2013 buquet et al 2016 heiss and michael 2014 robinson et al 2007a the water exchange across the aquifer ocean interface increase from the small amplitude neap to large amplitude spring tide leading to enhanced freshwater and saltwater mixing over a spring neap tidal cycle heiss and michael 2014 robinson et al 2007a salt distribution in the aquifer considerably response to spring neap tidal fluctuations in comparison with that subjected to semi diurnal or diurnal tides the usp expanses during the spring tides and oppositely contracts during the neap tides abarca et al 2013 buquet et al 2016 heiss and michael 2014 robinson et al 2007a furthermore this response is lagged behind tidal variations in comparison the location of lower saltwater wedge is less variable heiss and michael 2014 in natural systems tidal fluctuations with multiple constituents frequencies powers and phases are common e g solar semi diurnal s2 principle lunar semidiurnal m2 solar diurnal s1 and lunar diurnal o1 when tides propagate into an aquifer these multi constituent signals interact and lead to complicated groundwater table fluctuations and salt distributions abarca et al 2013 elad et al 2017 geng and boufadel 2017 it is recognized that aquifers behavior like a filter removing out high frequency signals and leaving low frequency signals in groundwater fluctuations li et al 2000 taniguchi 2002 amplitudes of these frequencies are gradually attenuated with increased horizontal distance from shoreline li et al 2000 mao et al 2006 parlange et al 1984 the groundwater fluctuations of nearby aquifer are found to lag behind tidal fluctuations in field investigations carr and der kamp 1969 and analytical solutions li et al 2000 parlange et al 1984 spectrum analysis on time series data is adopted to discover this complexity incorporated in field investigations elad et al 2017 geng and boufadel 2017 kobayashi et al 2017 taniguchi et al 2002 but the findings are diverse for example taniguchi 2002 found three different dominant tidal frequencies in the sgd variations under the complicated boundary conditions including the varied terrestrial freshwater and rainfall infiltration field investigations from elad et al 2017 suggested that groundwater levels and salinity fluctuations captured five dominant frequencies of the tide signals in the israeli coastal aquifer field observation of kobayashi et al 2017 indicated the diurnal and semidiurnal frequencies in sgd flux resemble the seawater fluctuation for field investigations it is easy to measure groundwater table fluctuations however monitoring salinity distributions groundwater flows and water exchange across the aquifer sea interface e g sgd are relatively difficult and non trivial burnett et al 2006 given this numerical modellings were conducted to provide insight into additional processes and enhance understanding of observed results geng and boufadel 2015b guo et al 2010 heiss and michael 2014 robinson et al 2007a synthetic tidal signals with principle components are fitted from observed tidal variations and then used to set up boundary conditions of numerical models the used curve fitting is essentially a smoothing process based on weighted least squares regression geng and boufadel 2015b heiss and michael 2014 robinson et al 2007a the purpose of using fitted synthetic tides are two fold 1 it was argued that the measured tide data could not be directly simulated as a continuous signal was required to run the model to reach a quasi steady state geng and boufadel 2015b heiss and michael 2014 robinson et al 2007a the simulation time required at timescale of hundreds of days is often larger than the observation period and 2 it simplifies the data analysis and captures the fundamental effect of tides on coastal aquifers while the above mentioned studies have revealed the complexity of tidal effects question remains unclear how measured multi constituent tidal signals affect the sgd and swi behaviors in a subterranean estuary different from the fitted synthetic tidal signals measured multi constituent tides would lead to a non periodic boundary condition and requires long term field investigations and numerical simulations to capture the continued response of the groundwater dynamics to tidal conditions given such a case a quasi steady state may not exist complicating the quantitative analysis based upon a series of companion papers robinson et al 2014 xin et al 2010 2014 2015 yu et al 2017 this paper examined the effect of measured multi constituent tides on sgd and swi in a subterranean estuary we conducted numerical simulations based on a well validated model with both measured multi constituent and fitted synthetic tidal conditions set as the seaside boundary conditions through comparison we examined both long term and short term effects of measured multi constituent tides on sgd and swi in a subterranean estuary we conducted regression analysis and quantified the effect of measured multi constituent tides on the variation of salinity distribution in a prolonged and cumulative fashion 2 conceptual and numerical model it should be noted that a subterranean estuary affected by measured multi constituent tides is in non equilibrium as it is continuously adjusting to the effects of previous tidal conditions which is not fully periodic unfortunately uncovering this long term effect incorporated in natural systems is challenging as it needs to monitor both oceanic and underground processes over a long duration hundreds of days as suggested by xin et al 2014 in comparison numerical modelling is readily achievable as done in this paper the model domain and parameter values were based on the conditions of a field site on the west coast of moreton island australia robinson et al 2006 similar to a series of papers robinson et al 2014 xin et al 2010 2014 2015 yu et al 2017 we considered here a 2 d vertical cross shore section of a nearshore unconfined aquifer fig 1 to focus on tidal effects we excluded waves rainfall and evaporation the aquifer was assumed homogeneous and isotropic and the groundwater flow and solute transport were negligible in the alongshore direction similar to our previous papers robinson et al 2014 xin et al 2010 2014 2015 yu et al 2017 the simulations were conducted based on sutra which simulates variably saturated and density dependent pore water flow and associated solute transport voss and provost 2008 in sutra the pore water flow is described by richards equation richards 1931 and soil saturation is calculated based on the van genuchten 1980 formulas see details in xin et al 2010 in this paper boundary ab was set to inland boundary with a fixed freshwater influx at 2 1 m3 m d boundaries af bc and cd were set to no flow boundary boundary def is the aquifer ocean interface linked to the tidal water in specific we considered the following tidal conditions fig 2 note that the elapsed days were referred to the beginning of year 2015 tide m real tide data measured from brisbane bar tidal station close to robinson et al 2006 field site on the west coast of moreton island website http data qld gov au dataset brisbane bar tide gauge archived interval recordings the measurement interval was 600 s based on the spectrum analysis fast fourier transform on the six year real data year 2011 2016 four dominant tidal constituents are detected 1 principal lunar semi diurnal m2 t tidal period 12 42 h 2 principal solar semi diurnal s2 t 12 h 3 lunar solar declinational diurnal k1 t 23 93 h 4 larger lunar elliptic semi diurnal n2 t 12 66 h the highest and lowest tidal level were respectively 1 53 and 1 35 m to identify the effect of low power tidal constituents on the subterranean estuary and uncover interactions among dominant tidal constituents we also conducted simulations with fitted synthetic tidal signals as done in previous studies geng and boufadel 2015b heiss and michael 2014 robinson et al 2007a the synthetic tidal signals were fitted using the equation as follows 1 h t h m s l i 1 n a i cos ω i t φ i where h t l is the tidal level at time t l hmsl is the mean sea level l ai is the amplitude of tide constituent i l ω i is the tidal angular frequency t 1 and ϕ i is the phase shift based on eq 1 we fitted out two synthetic tidal signals with different numbers of harmonics as follows tide 4 synthetic tides with four harmonic constituents m2 s2 k1 n2 the fitted amplitudes for these four constituents were respectively 0 73 0 19 0 19 and 0 15 m the phases were respectively 2 00 5 37 0 71 and 3 48 the highest and lowest tidal level were respectively 1 22 and 1 25 m the goodness of fitting was determined by adjusted r 2 at the value of 0 94 tide 2 synthetic tides with two harmonic constituents m2 s2 adjust r 2 0 86 their amplitudes were respectively 0 73 0 19 m with the phases of 2 00 and 5 37 the highest and lowest tidal level were respectively 0 92 and 0 92 m it is clear that from tide m to tide 4 and tide 2 the low power tidal constituents were gradually removed and the maximum tidal range was reduced from 2 88 m to 2 47 and 1 84 m fig 2 and table 1 we also calculated the averaged tidal level and standard deviation reflects the intensity of the tidal fluctuations of tidal levels over each principal lunar semi diurnal tidal cycle 12 42 h with less tidal constituents the variations of the averaged tidal level and standard deviation of tidal fluctuations every 12 42 h decreased note these two induces will be used for quantifying the sgd and swi later in this paper we focused on an aquifer similar to those used in previous studies robinson et al 2014 xin et al 2010 2014 2015 yu et al 2017 the model setup was based on a sandy beach with hydraulic conductivity ks 10 m d porosity ϕ 0 45 longitudinal dispersivity αl 0 5 m and transverse dispersivity αt 0 05 m carsel and parrish 1988 the residual water saturation swres was set to 0 1 while water retention parameters α and n was set to 14 5 m 1 and 2 68 for van genuchten 1980 formulas results in sections 3 1 to 3 3 to generalize the results we also conducted the sensitivity analysis on soil hydraulic conductivity and beach slope in the former simulation series the soil hydraulic conductivity was varied from ks 5 m d to ks 10 m d and ks 15 m d other parameters unchanged results in section 3 4 for the latter simulation series we allowed the beach slope ef in fig 1 to change from 1 10 to 1 12 5 and 1 15 in this way the model domain was changed accordingly other parameters were same as the base case with results presented in section 3 5 this model was run with a time step of 300 s for all the simulations note that the measured tide data at a 600 s interval were interpolated to generate input tidal data for the model further details such as mesh generation and setup of the tidal boundary conditions can be found in xin et al 2010 it is worth noting that this model has been validated against laboratory and field investigations kuan et al 2012 robinson et al 2006 xin et al 2010 and have been used for simulating groundwater dynamics and salt transport in the same model configuration subjected to tides waves and rainfall robinson et al 2014 xin et al 2010 2014 2015 yu et al 2017 3 results and analysis 3 1 long term effect of tides on sgd and swi in this paper we assume that the subterranean estuary is at a non equilibrium the model was run with six year tidal fluctuations but our analysis focuses on the last two years year 2015 2016 as suggested by robinson et al 2007b and xin et al 2010 the four year period prior to the analysis has spanned out the memory of the system with respect to both hydraulic heads and salinity distribution e g the behavior of the subterranean estuary might be affected by tidal conditions in year 2011 2014 but not those before firstly we examined the averaged results over the last two years year 2015 2016 we calculated per unit width fluxes across the aquifer ocean interface induced by tides and density we also calculated the salt mass stored in respectively the usp smusp and lower saltwater wedge smsw note that only the area of x 20 m was considered as seawater occupied the area for x 20 m table 1 it is worth noting that we calculated the salt mass stored in usp and lower saltwater wedge using the 5 isochlor of the saltwater salinity to separate the two saline zones mostly the 5 isochlor separated the usp and lower saltwater wedge sometimes the two saline bodies merged slightly in this case we adopted the local minimum salinity to separate them the measured multi constituent tides tide m led to the biggest tide induced circulating flux 1 46 m3 m d per unit width aquifer in comparison with the four constituent tides 1 25 m3 m d tide 4 and the two constituent tides 1 12 m3 m d tide 2 this was attributed to the reduced maximum tidal range from tide m to tide 4 and tide 2 from 2 88 m to 2 47 and 1 84 m fig 2 and table 1 in comparison the density driven flux didn t change so much as a sum of the inland freshwater input fixed at 2 1 m3 m d in all the simulations and the total circulating flux both tide induced and density driven the total sgd decreased with reduced tidal constituents suggesting that tide 4 and tide 2 with reduced tidal constituents under predicted the tidal contribution to the total sgd table 1 consistently tide m generated the biggest usp in the shallow aquifer fig 3 from the tide m case to the tide 4 and tide 2 cases the salt mass stored in the usp reduced from 872 to 684 22 reduction and 527 kg m 40 reduction this clearly showed that the synthetic tides with limited tidal constituents would under predict the tide induced usp and predicted biased salinity distribution in the shallow aquifer as the usp contracted and tide induced circulating flux decreased the lower saltwater wedge intruded further landward in the tide 4 and tide 2 cases however the change is not apparent with respect to the location of the toe and the salt mass stored in the lower saltwater wedge fig 3 and table 1 secondly we examined the per unit area water and salt fluxes across the aquifer ocean interface fig 4 both the zones for water and salt influxes contracted seawards x 15 m to x 5 m with reduced tidal constituents this was caused by the decreased tidal fluctuations during spring tides and consistent with the previous studies robinson et al 2007a an intensive inundation can induce significant saltwater infiltration in the shallow aquifer with the maximum tidal range under fitted tide 4 and tide 2 underestimated the influx zone tide m also led to the shift of water and salt efflux zone x 5 m to x 10 m towards the sea figs 3 and 4 3 2 short term effects of tides on sgd and swi in this section we examined the instantaneous behavior of the subterranean estuary over the last two years year 2015 2016 response to the dynamic tidal fluctuations the instantaneous water efflux sgd across the per unit width aquifer ocean interface varied dramatically fig 5 it is hard to see any apparent difference among different cases from both instantaneous results and averaged results over each 12 42 h we didn t detect any time lag between the sgd and tides peaks in fig 5d and e in comparison with those in fig 2d and e this suggested that the present sgd seemed to be affected by present tidal conditions rather than those antecedent however tide m tide 4 and tide 2 all led to apparent changes in the salinity distribution reflected by instantaneous salt mass stored in the usp smusp and lower saltwater wedge smsw figs 6 and 7 for the tide 2 case both smusp and smsw fluctuated periodically following a spring neap tidal cycle within the principal lunar semi diurnal cycle 12 42 h the variation was minor consistent with the previous studies heiss and michael 2014 robinson et al 2007a this clearly demonstrated that the aquifer filtered out high frequency tidal signals with further tidal constituents included in the tide 4 and tide m cases the overall smusp increased but smsw decreased for smusp of the tide m and tide 4 cases monthly periodic oscillations 27 3 d appeared and the fluctuation range max smusp min smusp over the two years increased in comparison with that of the tide 2 case i e 463 and 309 compared with 170 kg m the variation of smsw became more complicated particularly in the tide m case it was hard to see any periodic variation either of spring neap tidal cycle or monthly instead a yearly periodic oscitation clearly demonstrated 365 d note this didn t occur in the tide 4 case to uncover the behavior of the sgd and swi variations we conducted spectral analysis using fast fourier transfer fft the sampling size and sampling frequency utilized in fft are 8760 and 1 7200 hz i e the data was analyzed with consideration of the two year data with the time interval of 2 h in the spectral analysis we used the following standardized variables x and thus the amplitudes mentioned below were non dimensional the maximum minimum and mean values are listed in table 1 2 x x mean x max x min x as set up in the simulation cases high amplitude peaks were found at the frequencies of 2 24 10 5 2 31 10 5 1 16 10 5 and 2 19 10 5 hz for tidal fluctuations in the tide m and tide 4 cases fig 8 a those frequencies were respectively consistent with the m2 s2 k1 and n2 tides for the tide m case principal lunar semi diurnal m2 dominated the fluctuation with a contribution of 7 low frequency spanned from 10 8 to 10 5 hz reflecting the long period fluctuations involved in the measured tidal signals spectrogram of the sgd was overall similar to that of tides with respect to frequencies those frequencies associated with the m2 s2 k1 and n2 fig 8b tidal frequencies clearly existed in the tide m and tide 4 cases the m2 frequency with the amplitude of 0 27 was also the biggest component three times larger than the sum of those related to the other three dominant frequencies it was interesting that for the three cases a frequency of 7 83 10 7 hz corresponding to a period of 14 8 d i e a spring neap tidal period appeared furthermore a frequency of 4 24 10 7 hz corresponding to a period of 27 3 d appeared in the tide m and tide 4 cases but not in the tide 2 case this suggested that the sgd was affected by the interaction of tidal constituents more tidal constituents liked to generate more low frequency oscillations nevertheless the contribution of these low frequency variations to sgd was minor in our simulation cases the spectrograms of the smusp and smsw were remarkably different from those for the tides and sgd fig 8c and d four dominated frequencies in tide signals disappeared and high amplitude peaks appeared in the low frequency zones for smusp of the tide m and tide 4 cases high power peaks 0 12 0 09 and 0 09 for the tide m case 0 06 0 16 and 0 14 for the tide 4 case were found at the frequencies of 6 50 10 8 4 24 10 7 and 7 83 10 7 hz these frequencies respectively consistent with the periods of 178 1 27 3 and 14 8 d in comparison a spring neap tidal cycle with a period of 14 8 d clearly dominated in the tide 2 case we tested different combinations among the high frequency signals the results showed that the spring neap tidal cycle with a frequency of 7 83 10 7 hz was generated by the combination of m2 and s2 tidal constituents f s2 f m2 the signal with a frequency of 4 24 10 7 hz was generated by the combination of m2 and n2 tidal constituents f m2 f n2 the signal with a frequency of 6 50 10 8 hz was generated by the combination of m2 s2 and n2 tidal constituents 3f m2 2f n2 f s2 for smsw the amplitudes corresponding with 4 24 10 7 and 7 83 10 7 hz were much lower in the tide m case in comparison with the tide 4 and tide 2 cases instead a low frequency corresponding with a period of 365 d became to dominate in smsw that was apparently different from those of the tide 4 and tide 2 cases this yearly fluctuation contributed 14 4 to the smsw of the tide m case overall tidal signals interacted when propagating into aquifers and led to low frequency variations for all the results no apparent high frequency variations were caused by the interaction among tidal constituents this filtering effect was gradually intensified from sgd to smusp and smsw it could be imagined that the synthetic tides with low amplitude and low frequency signals excluded are unable to reproduce low frequency behavior of a subterranean estuary particularly the movement of lower saltwater wedge 3 3 quantification of the sgd and swi affected by measured multi constituent tides the filtering effect discussed above reflected that the sgd and swi behaviours responded to the varying tidal conditions in different fashions the subterranean estuary behaved as a band pass filter that passes frequencies within a certain range and attenuated frequencies outside that range furthermore combinations among high frequency signals tended to generate low frequency signals to explore and quantify this behavior we tested a series of regression models with the goodness of fitting quantified by adjusted r 2 as it was hard to quantify the instantaneous variations dominated by the m2 frequency we focused on running averaged results over each m2 tidal cycle 12 42 h in this section we focused on the tide m case with measured tide data firstly we tested a simultaneous linear regression with no consideration of possible effects of antecedent tidal conditions as follows 3 y a 0 a σ x σ a m x m e where y is the dependent value x σ and xm are the independent values respectively being the standard variation of tidal level and averaged tidal level over each lunar semi diurnal tidal cycle 12 42 h note that the two variables quantify tidal fluctuations over the tidal cycle with the former related to the tidal range and the latter indicating the averaged sea level a with subscripts are the coefficients of the regression model and e represents the error this model applied through optimization by adjusting the coefficients fitted the averaged sgd to a certain extent adjusted r 2 at 0 60 table 2 and figs 9 a and 10 a note that the addition of higher order terms would lead to improvement of fitting but in the same time it would lead to a regression model at a high level of complexity in the paper we focused on simple first order regressions so that the processes quantified would be readily understood as expected eq 3 failed to match the simulated salinity distribution smusp and smsw pre dominated by low frequencies we then hypothesized that the salinity distribution was affected by both present and antecedent tidal conditions similar to xin et al 2014 and yu et al 2017 we explored an approach based on functional data analysis fda ramsay and silverman 2005 which considered antecedent tidal conditions in a continuous and smooth function at a temporal scale to quantify the cumulative effect of the independent values x σ and xm we hypothesized that they can be weighted in the form of the following convolution 4 d t l i j n m ζ i j x i t j δ t j n m ζ i j where dtli is the parametric regressors i e the weighted tidal conditions combined in a cumulative fashion the subscript i indicates the independent value σ and m are respectively for the standard variation of tidal level and averaged tidal level over 12 42 h t is the present time t jδt is the given past time with δt being the increment set to 12 42 h as the averaged results were used for the analysis x i t jδt is the variable at that time the minimum and maximum values of j are respectively n and m which define the past time period considered ζ i j is a time dependent weighting factor described by a gamma distribution of the following probability density function pdf 5 ζ i j g a m m a α i β i j δ t β i α i 1 γ α i j δ t α i 1 e x p β i j δ t where α i and β i are respectively the shape and scale factors the ratio αi βi is the mathematical expectation mean of gamma distribution pdf which controls the tail of the distribution it should be noted that we chose gamma distribution function because it is flexible in providing weighting of different characteristics it is a combination of power and exponential functions and can be non monotonic if α 1 and has the advantage of characterizing the delayed and prolonged effect recently gamma distribution function is widely used to describe flow and solute transport in various hydrological systems kirchner et al 2000 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 xin et al 2014 yu et al 2017 furthermore the gamma distribution has no value at zero i e required that jδt 0 in this study we set n and m respectively to 1 and 1411 two years and thus eq 5 does not consider the effect of the present tidal conditions in this way the model considered the tidal conditions in the two antecedent years that is for fitting the aquifer behavior in year 2015 2016 the tidal variations in year 2013 2014 were considered we then explored how the averaged smusp and smsw might be related to dtl σ and or dtlm as discussed earlier a signal with a frequency of 6 50 10 8 hz period of 178 1 d appeared in smusp this new signal was generated by the combination of m2 s2 and n2 tidal constituents 3f m2 2f n2 f s2 and did not appear in either x σ or xm variations see the spectrograms in fig s1 of supplementary material for smusp we considered both the antecedent tidal conditions dtl σ and a new sinusoidal signal and finally adopted the following regression model 6 y a 0 a σ d t l σ a a sin ω t δ e where ω is the angular frequency related to the low frequency of 6 50 10 8 hz aa and δ are the amplitude and the phase shift of the new signal respectively for smsw we considered the antecedent tidal conditions dtl σ and dtlm and finally adopted the following regression model 7 y a 0 a σ d t l σ a m d t l m e the tidal fluctuations induced water and associated salt exchange across the aquifer sea interface leading to a varying usp the regression model eq 6 well fit the magnitude of the smusp variations adjusted r 2 at 0 86 fig 9b and captured the trend with respect to the peaks fig 10b this was well consistent with the spectral analysis that the smusp variations were affected by antecedent tidal conditions the fitting led to the determination of the α i and β j values which was consistent with a monotonic gamma distribution pdf α i 0 92 less than 1 suggesting that the past tidal effect on smusp decay immediately fig 11 a and table 2 however the past tidal effect reflected by standard variation was prolonged it was clear that the condition before 50 d still affected the present smusp smsw was examined subsequently with the both dtl σ and dtlm considered eq 7 fitted it to a high level of goodness adjusted r 2 at 0 95 fig 9c it can be seen it captured both the magnitude and trend of the simulated smsw fig 10c this fitting led to the determination of the two sets of α i and β j values it was very interesting that the dtl for the averaged sea level was consistent with a monotonic gamma distribution pdf α i 0 76 less than 1 suggesting that the past effect of averaged sea level on the smsw decay immediately fig 11b and table 2 however the dtl for the standard variation was consistent with a non monotonic gamma distribution pdf α i 1 80 large than 1 fig 11b and table 2 this suggested that the effect of varying tidal range was delayed the maximum impact occurred on day 28 being quantified by the mean of gamma distribution pdf αi βi smsw was more significantly affected by antecedent tidal fluctuations table 2 the values went up to 65 49 and 74 73 days respectively for the standard variation of tidal level and averaged tidal level it can be seen from fig 11b almost yearlong antecedent sea levels affected the present smsw in summary the results suggest that the sgd was altered by present tidal conditions but smusp and smsw were controlled by the antecedent tidal fluctuations smusp was sensitive to the fluctuation intensity over each lunar semi diurnal tidal cycle smsw responded to tidal fluctuations slowly and was affected by both the fluctuation amplitude and averaged sea level 3 4 importance of soil hydraulic conductivity in addition to the tide m case two additional simulation cases with the soil hydraulic conductivity ks set to 5 and 15 m d with other parameters unchanged were conducted here we focused on the salinity distributions which were affected by the low pass filtering capacity of the aquifer system as expected a bigger hydraulic conductivity led to an overall larger usp fig s2 in supplementary material as ks increased from 5 to 10 and 15 m d the averaged smusp over year 2015 2016 increased from 430 to 872 and 1080 kg m in this study the inland boundary was flux fixed and a bigger hydraulic conductivity would lead to an overall reduced horizontal hydraulic gradient as such the sw intruded further landward the averaged smsw over year 2015 2016 increased from 5368 to 8425 and 10 652 kg m as ks increased from 5 to 10 and 15 m d we also calculated the running averaged results of smusp and smsw over each m2 tidal cycle 12 42 h fig 12 and fitted them using eqs 6 and 7 respectively overall the regression models well fitted the smusp and smsw variations tables 3 and 4 figs s3 6 in supplementary material the parameters determinated by the fitting for smusp table 3 clearly showed the importance of ks the coefficient a σ increased significantly from 1216 to 2862 and 4441 kg m2 as ks increased from 5 to 10 and 15 m d respectively in contrast the coefficient aa amplitude of the sinusoidal signal varied slightly the ratio of a σ to aa increased from 24 5 to 44 6 and 79 2 respectively this suggested that the contribution of dtl σ was significantly enhanced in affecting smusp as ks increased furthermore as ks increased from 5 to 10 and 15 m d the related probability density function became flat reflecting the increased weight of long dated forcing conditions fig 13 a consistently ασ βσ increased from 12 08 to 13 69 and 17 83 d respectively suggesting an enhanced effect of antecedent tidal fluctuations i e the present smusp recorded more past tidal conditions the smsw variations were affected by both the standard variation of tidal level and averaged tidal level table 4 for all the three simulation cases with different ks values the contribution of the two played competing roles the coefficient a σ for dtl σ took negative values but am for dtlm took positive values table 4 as ks increased from 5 to 10 and 15 m d the a σ value decreased from 4415 to 9321 and 12 580 kg m2 respectively however am increased from 3491 to 4043 and 4320 kg m2 respectively table 4 clearly the contribution of dtl σ played an increasingly predominant role as ks increased the mean values of the associated gamma distribution of both the standard variation of tidal level and averaged tidal level decreased as ks increased table 4 suggesting that the present smsw recorded less effect of past tidal conditions consistently the two associated probability density functions became steeper reflecting the increased weight of recent forcing conditions fig 13b and c 3 5 importance of beach slope in addition to the tide m case with the 1 10 beach slope two additional simulation cases with the beach slope set to 1 12 5 and 1 15 were conducted note the horizontal distance of beach was expanded to 75 and 90 m respectively the other parameters were unchanged as the tidal conditions were the same a reduced beach slope led to an extended intertidal zone and an expanded usp fig s7 in supplementary material as the beach slope decreased from 1 10 to 1 12 5 and 1 15 the averaged smusp over year 2015 2016 increased from 872 to 1145 and 1408 kg m respectively however the averaged salt mass decreased from 8425 to 7792 to 7291 kg m respectively eqs 6 and 7 also well fitted the running averaged results of smusp and smsw over each m2 tidal cycle fig 14 respectively tables 3 and 4 figs s8 11 in supplementary material from the parameter values determinated by the fitting for the smusp table 3 it can be seen that the coefficient a σ increased significantly from 2 862 to 4 044 and 5 333 kg m2 as the beach slope decreased from 1 10 to 1 12 5 and 1 15 respectively in the meantime the coefficient aa amplitude of the sinusoidal signal also increased from 64 13 to 90 27 and 121 70 kg m2 respectively the ratio of a σ to aa changed slightly from 44 6 to 44 8 and 43 8 respectively suggesting that the interaction among m2 s2 and n2 tidal constituents kept increasing following the trend of dtl σ furthermore as the beach slope decreased the related probability density function became flat reflecting the increased weight of long dated forcing conditions fig 15 a consistently ασ βσ increased from 13 69 to 18 65 and 24 85 d as the beach slope decreased from 1 10 to 1 12 5 and 1 15 respectively this suggested that the more mildly sloping beach enhanced the effect of antecedent tidal fluctuations on smusp overall the smsw variations were affected by competing effects of the standard variation of tidal level and averaged tidal level similar to that discussed in section 3 4 table 4 as the beach slope decreased from 1 10 to 1 12 5 and 1 15 the ratio of a σ to am changed slightly from 2 3 to 2 1 and 2 5 respectively suggesting that the contributions of dtl σ and dtlm were not significantly altered however the mean values of the associated gamma distribution of the standard variation of tidal level and averaged tidal level showed different trends ασ βσ increased from 65 49 to 66 24 and 68 76 d however αm βm decreased from 74 73 to 70 67 and 68 54 respectively as the beach slope decreased from 1 10 to 1 12 5 and 1 15 the associated probability density functions also changed in the opposite directions the one for the standard variation of tidal level became flatter fig 15b but the one for the averaged tidal level became steeper fig 15c this reflected an enhanced effect of usp which was mainly altered by the standard variation of tidal level a more mildly sloping beach led to a larger usp which recorded more past tidal conditions this modification in turn affected the lower saltwater wedge and weakened the impact from the averaged tidal level 4 discussions field investigations observed groundwater and salinity variations in tidally influenced subterranean estuaries by using of boreholes and buried sensors and measure the small scale sgd with the seepage meter abarca et al 2013 geng and boufadel 2015b guo et al 2010 mao et al 2006 robinson et al 2007a taniguchi 2002 these investigations found that the coastal groundwater fluctuations and sgd flux response to the tidal fluctuations in which the frequencies of tidal constituents are discovered our simulation results were well consistent with these field investigations suggesting that the sgd process is simultaneous with the present tidal variations rather than the antecedent variations in this paper the inland freshwater discharge rate was fixed and the sgd variation was mainly caused by seawater recirculation the simultaneous sgd response suggested that both seawater and associated nutrients entering the seaside subterranean estuary is mainly affected by present tidal conditions the simulation results also showed that salt distribution in the shallow aquifer represented by the size of usp considerably response to spring neap tidal fluctuations in comparison with that subjected to semi diurnal or diurnal tides this was consistent with the reported field investigation on sandy beaches heiss and michael 2014 robinson et al 2007a the response of the lower saltwater wedge was much sluggish in agreement with heiss and michael 2014 usp is often with faster flow rates and shorter residence times in comparison with lower saltwater wedge robinson et al 2007b as chemical compositions e g dissolved oxygen and ph of recirculating seawater and discharging fresh groundwater are apparently different a quick response of usp to tides would enhance freshwater seawater mixing and biogeochemical reaction in a subterranean estuary the regression results suggested that salinity distribution was significantly affected by antecedent tidal conditions this was consistent with the results from our previous studies on waves and rainfalls robinson et al 2014 xin et al 2014 2015 yu et al 2017 which suggested that the unconfined aquifer continually adjust the salinity distribution in response to the forcing condition in a cumulative fashion it could be expected that an aquifer system was unable to maintain an equilibrium state with a non periodic inland and or seaward forcing conditions the salinity distribution such as usp in the shallow aquifer response to the forcing condition in a prolonged fashion the size of usp would then combined with averaged sea level to alter the lower saltwater wedge kuan et al 2012 robinson et al 2007b xin et al 2010 in this way the lower saltwater wedge recorded the antecedent tidal fluctuations over a remarkably long period the usp appeared in the shallow aquifer and its maximum impact on the lower saltwater wedge was delayed therefore long term observations are necessary for the tidally influenced coastal aquifers observation of the forcing conditions could be made and considered to interpret the present salinity distributions single frequency monochromatic tides and bi chromatic spring neap tides have been widely used in previous modelling studies to uncover fundamental effect of tides on subterranean estuaries see review of robinson et al 2018 the simple tidal conditions are easy to setup in numerical models and simplifies the result analysis however numerical simulations used to reproduce field conditions should consider the measured real tidal fluctuations which are often with many constituents according to our results the fluctuation range over the spring tidal period played an important role in altering the circulating sgd and the size of usp fitted synthetic tides with the under fitted tidal range during spring tides would under predict sgd and the size of usp high frequency signals tend to interact in the aquifer and generate low frequency signals these low frequency signals together with low frequency signals already in the tidal fluctuations would jointly affect the long term salinity distribution in the aquifer nevertheless setting up fitted synthetic tides depends on modelling goals to simulate the sgd variations fitted synthetic tides could include high frequency signals as the response of sgd to tides is simultaneous in nature these high frequency signals e g solar semi diurnal s2 principle lunar semidiurnal m2 solar diurnal s1 and lunar diurnal o1 tend to have high powers and are expected to be identified by curve fitting used in the previous studies to simulate the swi processes low frequency signals such as seasonal variation would become important and could not be excluded low frequency tidal signals would affect the overall horizontal hydraulic gradient between inland freshwater and seawater and thus affect both usp and lower saltwater wedge particularly in long time scale robinson et al 2018 werner et al 2013 the intensity of filtering effect reflects the dependence of present status on the past conditions from our examination a long term dependence likely filtered the high frequency variation in the past this was apparently demonstrated by the lower saltwater wedge which captured the year long antecedent tidal fluctuations this cumulative antecedent effect led to a smooth variation without high frequency oscillations a quantitative analysis on the behavior of a subterranean estuary could attempt to build up relationship between the present status and antecedent forcing conditions the functional data analysis as done in this paper could be a useful way to weigh the prolonged and cumulative effect of antecedent forcing conditions 5 conclusions this paper has examined numerically the sgd and swi behaviors in a typical unconfined aquifer subjected to measured multi constituent tides with the antecedent tidal conditions accounted for using the gamma distribution function regression models were developed to quantify the associated sgd and swi behaviors from the present study the following conclusions can be drawn 1 coastal aquifer likely filters out high frequency tidal signals such as those of the m2 s2 k1 and n2 tides and leave behind low frequency signals to affect the upper saline plume and lower saltwater wedge furthermore high frequency signals tend to interact in the aquifer and generate low frequency signals these low frequency signals jointly affect the long term behavior of the aquifer 2 upper saline plume and lower saltwater wedge are significantly affected by antecedent tidal conditions based on our results salinity distribution in the shallow usp and deep saltwater wedge aquifer were affected by antecedent tidal conditions at monthly and yearly time scales respectively 3 effect of antecedent tidal conditions are moderated by soil hydraulic conductivity and beach slope based on our results with a flux fixed inland boundary a larger soil hydraulic conductivity would enhance the effect of antecedent tidal conditions on usp but reduce that on saltwater wedge a more mildly sloping beach would enhance the effect of antecedent tidal conditions on usp which in turn affects the lower saltwater wedge this paper focused on tides and excluded waves rainfall and inland freshwater variations all these forcing factors are likely to be irregular and thus lead to a more complicated subterranean estuary we considered here a two dimensional homogeneous and isotropic aquifer and yet aquifer heterogeneity and anisotropy under natural conditions would complicate further the processes in the subterranean estuary the inland boundary condition was flux specified in this paper it remains uncertain if the results are applicable to those head specified these additional factors should be examined in future investigations to explore further the complexity of subterranean estuaries acknowledgements this

702,in addition to intrinsic matrix pores ranging in size from submicrons to microns vuggy carbonates often contain significantly larger vug spaces immiscible multiphase fluids flowing through this type of microporous systems exhibit complicated flow mechanisms that are involved in the interactions between multiphase fluids and different types of pore spaces modeling multiphase fluid flows requires using the appropriate governing equations for different porosity systems more specifically while multiphase darcy s equations might hold for a matrix system they are not applicable for a vug system to improve understanding this difficult multiphase flow problem in vuggy carbonates we developed a unified grayscale lattice boltzmann lb model for multiphase flows the proposed model combines the generalized lb model in porous media with the pseudo potential multiphase approach by adding the fluid fluid interaction force the fluid solid interaction force and the linear and nonlinear drag forces induced by the porous matrix the model is still within the framework of the generalized lb model and it switches freely from the darcy s regime to the free flow regime via rock property i e porosity it can also extend to a wide range of porosity systems because we incorporated both the linear and nonlinear drag effects a continuous flow interface between the porous matrix and the vug region is captured by simulation without incorporating complex interface boundary conditions between the two porosity systems the current model is validated and calibrated with theory and then it is applied to a number of test cases the test cases include the simulations of two phase displacement in non vuggy porous media isolated vuggy porous media and connected vuggy fractured porous media moreover the effect of vug spaces on the interface front speed and the breakthrough time is investigated in addition we simulated water displacing oil in two real vuggy carbonate cores imaged using low resolution and high resolution x ray computed microtomography and we investigated the effects of matrix heterogeneity vug connectivity and matrix wetting preference keywords vuggy carbonate multiphase flow lattice boltzmann method grayscale model 1 introduction carbonate is an important conventional resource because it contributes a significant proportion of the world s total hydrocarbon reserves and daily hydrocarbon production unlike most sandstone reservoirs which are relatively homogeneous single porosity systems carbonate reservoirs are characterized by a highly heterogeneous microporous system newberry et al 1996 yao et al 2015 the microporous system is often classified as primary porosity and secondary porosity which are attributed to various diagenetic and geologic processes primary porosity which we will refer to as micro porosity is formed by deposition it is associated with the original depositional texture of the sediment primary pores are usually at the submicron scale to micron scale including intergranular pores intra particle pores and inter crystalline pores anselmetti et al 1998 secondary porosity is formed by post depositional dissolution vug is a common type of secondary porosity it can be further divided into isolated vugs and connected vugs isolated vugs are separate pore spaces that are connected through intergranular pores connected vugs form high flow channels that can be viewed as dissolution enlarged fractures in addition to stress induced fractures vik et al 2012 zhang et al 2005 analyzed a carbonate sample using x ray computed tomography ct and reported that 64 of the total pore volume was in vugs and 36 was in matrix pore spaces based on advanced micro computed tomography µ ct analysis of carbonate core samples arns et al 2005 identified a broad size distribution for vugs ranging from a few microns to millimeters the broad variety of pore space sizes in a microporous system distinguishes the petrophysical properties of carbonates from most other types of reservoir rocks including sandstone and shale one of the most important petrophysical properties of carbonates is the relative permeability of two fluid phases in order to improve the prediction and producibility of enhanced oil recovery in carbonate reservoirs it is necessary to enhance the understanding of the multiphase flow mechanism in this type of microporous medium as a prerequisite step for reservoir formation evaluation and reservoir simulation core analysis identifies the important petrophysical properties of the targeted reservoir in carbonate reservoirs with complex spatial heterogeneity obtaining physical core flooding measurements under different boundary conditions can easily take months or even longer and the process is often expensive and non repeatable mcphee et al 2015 alternatively with advances in high resolution imaging techniques numerical flow simulations on image based core samples have recently become a reliable and fast tool for characterizing petrophysical properties dvorkin et al 2008 crawshaw and boek 2013 anderson 2014 typically in imaging techniques as the image pixel resolution increases the total image size decreases and vice versa thus it is contradictory to resolve submicron micron pore spaces and also include significantly larger vugs in a single resolution image arns et al 2005 pore scale multiphase simulations cannot ensure the representativeness of highly vuggy carbonate cores and they are unable to explain the effects of various sized vugs to increase the sample size in order to include vug spaces and reach the representative volume one has to use coarser imaging resolution and expect some loss of detail such as less information about microporosity and the mineral components in coarse resolution carbonate rocks multiphase flow modeling is more challenging than pore scale simulation due to factors such as the interactions between the reservoir fluids and the microporous systems egermann et al 2007 wu et al 2006 kang et al 2002 kang et al 2006 zhang et al 2016 yao et al 2010 it is necessary to consider the mass transfer both within the same type of porosity system i e within the matrix pores and within the vugs and between the different types of porosity systems i e between the matrix pores and the vugs zhang et al 2018 macroscopic scale equations based on darcy s law are applicable for multiphase flows in well sorted reservoir rocks but the validity is questionable in highly heterogeneous vuggy carbonates as a class of computational fluid dynamics methods the lattice boltzmann method lbm arises from the molecular kinetic theory and it tracks the evolution of the particle density distribution function lbm is a good candidate for modeling fluid flows in complex geometries due to its simplicity of treating the boundary conditions chen et al 2013 liu et al 2016 as more advanced imaging and computing resources become available it has been possible to perform direct simulations in reconstructed digital pore structures using highly efficient parallelization procedures rinaldi et al 2012 zhou et al 2012 chen et al 2018 furthermore for multiphase flows in porous media lbm usually automatically computes the fluid fluid interfaces without explicitly tracking them porter et al 2009 liu et al 2016 several multiphase lattice boltzmann lb models have been developed over the past two decades including the color gradient model gunstensen et al 1991 the pseudopotential model shan and chen 1993 and the free energy model swift et al 1995 the previous multiphase lb models have been well applied to mimic the complex drainage and imbibition process to recover multiphase properties at pore scale hao and cheng 2010 boek and venturoli 2010 liu et al 2016 however for carbonates with heterogeneous vug spaces that are significantly larger than matrix pores a detailed description of the micro pore geometry is unavailable in a lower resolution ct scanned core sample therefore to investigate the transport properties in vuggy carbonates vug scale flow models also referred to as grayscale models are needed to retain both the vug spaces and the important rock matrix properties grayscale lb models of single phase flows have been developed for heterogeneous porous media spaid and phelan 1997 dardis and mccloskey 1998 freed 1998 martys 2001 guo and zhao 2002 benamram et al 2016 the grayscale models allow a certain degree of flow for all of the simulation elements and they differ from the black white models that classify a simulation element as being either solid or void grayscale multiphase lb models for vuggy carbonates are currently lacking in the literature except for studies conducted by zalzale et al 2016 and pereira 2016 the grayscale model development for multiphase flows involves great challenges which are summarized as follows first multiphase flows in vugs are dominated by viscous force and fluid fluid interfacial tension however the controlling force in a matrix becomes the drag forces due to the rock grains thus it is very challenging to simultaneously implement proper transport equations for different flow regions in vuggy porous media second when modeling multiphase flows through vuggy core samples it is difficult to satisfy the interface conditions between different types of porosity systems because they involve not only the continuity of the fluid velocities and the shear stresses but also the effects of geometric heterogeneity in this work we aim to develop a unified grayscale multiphase lattice boltzmann model to simulate multiphase flows for vuggy carbonates recently zalzale et al 2016 proposed a gray multiphase lb model that combines the free energy lb model with the partial bounce back approach however their model focused on single component two phase systems which limits its applications in immiscible two phase flow problems pereira 2016 proposed an lb model for immiscible multiphase flow through heterogeneous porous media by combining the pseudo potential lb model with the single phase grayscale model to yield a multiphase lb that study successfully simulated two phase flow in real sandstone samples the models proposed by zalzale et al 2016 and pereira 2016 assumed partial bounce back at each lattice node where the partial coefficient is related to the solid fraction in a particular voxel thus they assumed that the degree of fluid particles passing through a rock voxel is linearly dependent on the porosity which remains questionable for some reservoir rocks in this work we extend the idea of the generalized lb proposed in guo and zhao 2002 to multiphase systems by coupling the pseudo potential multiphase approach yielding a grayscale multiphase lb model we adopt the forcing scheme developed by he et al 1998 because the forcing scheme in guo and zhao s 2002 original work was designed for single phase flows we incorporate both the porous medium s linear darcy and nonlinear forcheimer drag effects on different fluid components into the model the total force for a fluid component contains the fluid fluid interaction force the drag forces due to the porous matrix and the fluid solid interaction force if wettability is considered for a simulation element representing the fine grained porous matrix the proposed grayscale lb model is reduced to the multiphase darcy model if the porous matrix is coarse grained this model is reduced to the multiphase forcheimer model for a simulation element representing vug space free flow region our grayscale lb model returns to the original pseudo potential multiphase lb model a diffusive interface between the porous matrix and the vug space is computed automatically without incorporating complex interface boundary conditions this paper is structured as follows first we discuss the formulation and development of the proposed lb model second we briefly review some of the common boundary condition bc treatments in lbm and we present an outflow bc for pressure driven multiphase flows in the appendix third the model validation and calibration are discussed to address some benchmark problems next we present two phase simulations for different types of porous media including a pure porous matrix an isolated vuggy porous media and a connected vuggy fractured porous media then two vuggy carbonate cores are imaged using low resolution µ ct and high resolution µ ct we simulate multiphase flows in two dimensional 2d vuggy carbonate cores and we investigate the effects of matrix heterogeneity and vug connectivity on multiphase behavior the effect of matrix wetting preference is also investigated by considering the rock fluid interaction in addition we compare the mass fraction flow at the outlet for all cases and the residual oil distribution for different wetting preferences the conclusions are presented in the final section of this paper 2 model formulation the pseudo potential multiphase lb model also known as the shan chen model was first proposed by shan and chen 1993 in the shan chen model each fluid component has a set of distribution functions that relax to the equilibrium states at their corresponding rates for an immiscible multiphase system phase separation or aggregation occurs when introducing a repulsive or attractive force into fluid particles the inter particle interaction force is modeled by a pseudo potential function that assumes it exists non local interaction between fluid particles and a green function determines the interaction strength between fluid particles the pseudo potential multiphase lattice boltzmann equation is expressed as 1 f σ α x e α δ t t δ t f σ α x t f σ α x t f σ α e q x t τ σ 1 1 2 τ σ δ t f σ α where f σ α and f σ α e q are the distribution function and the equilibrium distribution function for the σth component respectively x and t are the spatial and temporal indices respectively and δ t is the temporal spacing for the d2q9 model the discrete particle velocity e α is given as e 0 0 0 e α cos α 1 π 2 sin α 1 π 2 for α 1 4 and e α 2 cos 2 α 1 π 4 2 sin 2 α 1 π 4 for α 5 8 τσ is the dimensionless relaxation time for the σth component and it relates the fluid viscosity through ν σ 1 3 τ σ 0 5 the equilibrium distribution function is defined as 2 f σ α e q x t ω α ρ σ 1 e α u eq c s 2 e α u eq 2 2 c s 4 u eq u eq 2 c s 2 where cs is the speed of sound ωα is the weighting factor defined as ω0 4 9 ω1 4 1 9 and ω5 8 1 36 f σ α is the discrete forcing term derived directly from the continuous boltzmann equation he et al 1998 and it has the form 3 f σ α f σ e α u eq ρ σ c s 2 f σ α e q where f σ contains all external forces and body forces u eq is the equilibrium velocity that is described by an effective velocity for the fluid mixture porter et al 2012 as 4 u eq σ ρ σ u σ τ σ σ ρ σ τ σ the macroscopic density and velocity for each component can be calculated as 5 ρ σ α f σ α 6 u σ α f σ α e α τ σ f σ ρ σ the total velocity of the fluid mixture and the pressure are 7 u σ ρ σ u σ σ ρ σ and 8 p c s 2 σ ρ σ 1 2 c s 2 g c σ σ ρ σ ρ σ notice that the original shan chen multiphase model and the later improved model by shan and doolen 1995 do not include the forcing term in the distribution evolution function namely no last term in eq 1 instead forces are incorporated into the equilibrium distribution function by shifting macroscopic velocity according to newton s second law the shan chen and shan doolen models have achieved great success in simulating multiphase flow in porous media but researchers have reported several limitations including numerical instabilities for large density ratios numerical instabilities for large kinematic viscosity ratios viscosity dependent equilibrium densities etc porter et al 2012 more importantly guo and zhao 2009 pointed out that the forcing scheme in the shan chen and the shan doolen models resulted in hydrodynamic equations that are inconsistent with navier stokes equations the forcing scheme appeared in eq 1 recovers the navier stokes equations with an additional term of ϑ u 3 through the chapman enskog expansion fluid flows in porous media are low mach number flows so the ϑ u 3 term is negligible in eq 3 f σ is the total force acting on the σth component and includes a fluid fluid interaction force f σ c defined as 9 f σ c g c ψ σ x t α ω e α 2 ψ σ x e α δ t t e α where σ and σ represent two different fluid components ψσ is the interparticle potential or the effective mass gc is the fluid fluid interaction strength that controls the interfacial tension and fluid miscibility positive for a repulsive force and negative for an attractive force ψσ is a function of local density and is usually set as ψσ ρσ for binary mixtures note that eq 9 is the finite difference discretization of g c ψ σ ψ σ on discrete lattice nodes so increasing the number of neighboring lattice nodes can increase the isotropy order of the fluid fluid interaction force as a result the spurious current a non physical velocity field in the vicinity of the fluid interface is significantly reduced at a higher order of isotropy chen et al 2014 in this work we use two neighboring layers of fluid nodes to discretize the fluid fluid interaction force ensuring up to 8th order tensor isotropy up to now the above discussions remain the standard multiphase lb model that relies upon the clear description of geometrical shape for flow regions however vuggy carbonates contain pore spaces that are sometimes varying from submicrons to centimeters so it is impossible to include all fine scale matrix pores in a macro scale simulation therefore the development of the grayscale multiphase model retaining both larger scale vug spaces and the properties of fine scale matrix pores is critical in this study similar with the work in guo and zhao 2002 we redefine f σ α and f σ α e q for eq 1 as the volume averaged distribution function and the equilibrium distribution function for the σth component at the representative elementary volume rev scale respectively the eq 1 becomes 10 f σ α x e α δ t t δ t f σ α x t f σ α x t f σ α e q x t τ σ 1 1 2 τ σ δ t f σ α notice that the volume averaging is just a conceptual averaging on every cartesian lattice and no averaging effort is needed in real simulations also all variables appeared in eq 10 remain the same forms of eqs 1 9 but they are volume averaged quantities therefore we neglect the overbars for convenience in order to include the effect of the porous medium we need to define external forces for fluids including drag forces induced by the porous matrix guo and zhao 2002 defined the drag forces in porous matrix for single phase flows for a multiphase system inspired by the previous studies schulenberg and muller 1987 evans and evans 1988 liu et al 1995 wu 2002 we define an external force due to the porous matrix f σ p m on the σth component by incorporating both the linear and nonlinear drag forces as 11 f σ p m ϕ ν σ k k σ u σ ϕ η η σ u σ u σ ϕ g σ where φ is the porosity of the porous matrix ϕ ν σ k k σ u σ is the darcy term ϕ η η σ u σ u σ is the no darcy term or the forcheimer term in the case of flowing through packed beds of coarse particles and φg σ is the body force for the σth component though the non darcy term can be neglected for the primary porosity system matrix with submicron micron pores in vuggy carbonates as the fluid velocity is very small we keep this term for model generality k is the intrinsic permeability of the porous matrix η is the intrinsic non darcy coefficient of the porous matrix or sometimes termed as passibility of the porous matrix k σ and ησ are the relative permeability and the passibility for the σth component respectively for many reservoir rocks excluding shale and other tight rocks k and η are usually independent of fluid types and they simply depend on geometric pore structures for example assuming the porous matrix is media filled with uniformly distributed spherical particles the intrinsic permeability k and non darcy coefficient η can be calculated ergun 1952 as 12 k d 2 150 ϕ 3 1 ϕ 2 13 η d 1 75 ϕ 3 1 ϕ where d is the diameter of spherical particles and 150 and 1 75 are two shape parameters for matching the friction factor in packed beds of spherical particles ergun 1952 the relative permeability can have various forms based on fluid fluid interfacial tension rock heterogeneity capillarity of rock the relative permeability k σ and the non darcy coefficient ησ are functions of fluid saturation the simplest forms for k σ and ησ are 14 k σ s σ n 15 η σ s σ n where s σ is the saturation of the σth component defined as the volume of the fluid σ to total pore volume it can be approximated by s σ ρ σ m σ ρ σ m σ ρ σ m σ if assuming the ideal fluid equation of states where m σ is the molecular mass of the component σ summing up the saturation of all fluid phases we get 16 σ s σ 1 note that the exponent n is an empirical constant in eqs 14 and 15 and the forms of relative permeability and non darcy coefficient may vary for different particle beddings different rock types and different wetting preferences if we consider the fluid fluid interaction as described in eq 9 it would be reasonable to use n 1 n 1 indicates that fluid fluid interfacial effect is already included in eqs 14 and 15 which is a double count on the interfacial effect with eq 9 rock wetting preference plays a significant role in core flooding processes if a rock is oil wet the water phase has to overcome capillary force to displace the oil phase whereas for a water wet rock the capillary force becomes a driving force for water displacement in order to include the capillarity we define a force that describes the rock fluid interaction due to rock wetting preference as 17 f σ a d s x t g σ a d s ρ σ x t α ω e α 2 1 ϕ x e α δ t e α where g σ a d s is the rock fluid interaction parameter that can be adjusted for a desired capillarity g σ a d s is positive for non wetting fluid and negative for wetting fluid according to the young laplace law the capillarity is more significant in a smaller capillary tube for two fluid phases generally but not rigorously speaking if a rock s porosity is small the average pore size is likely small and the capillarity should be significant but this is not always true especially for rocks with complex pore morphology if detailed pore morphology is unavailable we approximate the capillarity as a function of porosity for the preliminary attempt in eq 17 it shows that f σ a d s is zero if φ 1 and it becomes larger as φ is reduced eq 17 is different from the adsorption force in black white models chen et al 2014 which include an indicator function as being either 0 or 1 by combining all forces for the σth component the total force f σ becomes 18 f σ ϕ ν σ k k σ u σ ϕ η η σ u σ u σ ϕ g σ 1 ρ σ f σ c f σ a d s substituting eq 18 into eq 6 we can obtain the macroscopic velocity however eq 6 is an implicit form of velocity as f σ also contains velocity terms carefully solving this equation we can obtain the velocity field explicitly as 19 u σ a 2 a 0 2 a 1 a 2 where a 0 a 1 and a 2 are intermediate parameters expressed as 20 a 0 1 2 1 δ t 2 ϕ ν σ k k σ 21 a 1 δ t 2 ϕ η η σ and 22 a 2 α f σ α e α ρ σ δ t 2 ϕ g σ 1 ρ σ f σ c f σ a d s another important topic in lbm is the boundary condition bc treatment generally bcs are given in terms of the macroscopic variables for fluid dynamics problems such as velocity pressure and so on however the basic variable in lbm is the distribution function so it is not always an easy task to solve unknown distributions functions for boundary nodes especially in a multiphase system in appendix we will briefly review some of the common bc schemes in lbm and present a proper pressure bc for the outlet 3 model discussion and limitations from eqs 12 13 and 18 one can see that as ϕ approaches to unity i e in the completely void spaces vugs this grayscale multiphase model is reduced to the standard pseudo potential multiphase model when ϕ is between zero and unity the proposed model returns to the forcheimer multiphase model the proposed model has attractive features as follows first it is still within the framework of the pseudo potential lb model so it is very easy to implement and code second since both the linear darcy and nonlinear forcheimer drag effects are incorporated into the model it is applicable to a wide range of porosity third the interface between the porous matrix and the free flow region is automatically computed without dealing with complex interface conditions however there exists several challenges that the current model is facing and necessary improvements are needed in the future work the model limitations are summarized in the following the current model assumes the micro porosity is assumed to be well connected and multiphase flows in the micro porosity system follows a nearly piston like displacement this assumption causes an important challenge in modeling residual trapping in a matrix element the phase phase interaction of two immiscible phases is modeled by g c ψ σ ψ σ and gc controls the strength of one phase repulsing the other one the coexistence of both phases in one matrix element can be achieved by reducing the phase phase interaction strength but its exact correlations with saturation and other factors are currently unknown in the current model the model is still within the standard lbm framework meaning the recovered macroscopic equations describe compressible flows with the incompressible limits therefore the compressibility effect cannot be eliminated when modeling two phase incompressible flows which results in compressibility errors in the calculation of phase volume fractions saturations the wettability of rock matrix is modeled the rock fluid interaction force in eq 17 and the wetting strength is dependent on gads and φ a contact angle between zero and π can be yielded depending on the values of gads in the current model the rock wetting preference oil wet water wet or neutral wet can be achieved but the exact relation between the contact angle and gads requires future investigations 4 model validation and calibration 4 1 validation of single phase grayscale lb model in this section we first validate our model and code with the analytical solution of the single phase darcy brinkman equation the benchmark problem is that fluid driven by a body force flows between two parallel plates filled with homogeneous porous material the darcy brinkman equation for this flow problem is given by 23 ν e ϕ 2 u g ν k u 0 where g is the body force φ and k are the porosity and permeability of the porous medium ν is the fluid viscosity and ν e is the effective viscosity or the brinkman viscosity assuming the width between the parallel plates is h and the fluid is flowing in y direction we have the analytical solution of eq 23 as 24 u y g k ν 1 cosh b y h 2 cosh b h 2 where b ν ϕ k ν e and ν e is set to be equal with ν here now let s define two dimensionless numbers reynolds number and darcy number as 25 r e h u 0 ν d a k h 2 where u 0 is the velocity in the middle layer for the simulations we set the porosity to be 0 1 and the relaxation time to be 1 0 the reynolds number ranges from 0 00042 to 2 56 and the darcy number ranges from 1e 6 to 0 01 we used 50 lu 50 lu lu stands for the lattice unit in this test the periodic bcs are applied to the inlet and the outlet and the half way bounce back bcs are applied to the parallel walls for non slip velocity boundaries fig 1 shows a comparison between the grayscale lb model results and the analytical solution the comparison shows good agreements for various re and da numbers when the reynolds number and the darcy number are large i e re 2 56 and da 0 01 the solution approaches to the standard poiseuille flow when the reynolds number and the darcy number are very small i e re 0 00042 and da 1e 6 the solutions are almost identical cross the parallel plates regardless of the boundary effects which confirms darcy s law 4 2 validation of multiphase model compared to a buckley leverett solution the buckley leverett b l equation models two phase flow in porous media describing immiscible displacement processes to validate the multiphase model we compare the simulation results with the analytical solution of the b l equation under the similar assumptions in the b l analysis we assume both of the residual oil saturation and the irreducible water saturation to be 0 2 and the displacement is nearly piston like in the lbm simulation the water phase is injected at a constant rate into a porous media of a pseudo 1d domain periodic bcs on two sides in fig 2 the water saturation vs the normalized position is compared between two approaches we can see that the analytical solution of the buckley leverett approach presents a sharp change of the water saturation at the water front our simulated results show the diffusive change at the water front the possible causes for this noticeable discrepancy may be the following 1 assumptions are not identical in both approaches specifically in the b l analysis fluids are assumed to be perfectly incompressible but lbm has non negligible compressibility effects one variable in the b l equation is the water saturation defined as the water volume fraction but lbm computes the phase density at lattices estimation of the water saturation using two phase densities contains errors induced by the compressibility effects 2 numerical diffusion is non negligible numerical diffusion in multiphase lbm can be decreased by incorporating higher order models or refining the mesh size but can never be eliminated 4 3 calibration of the inter component strength to the interfacial tension in the pseudo potential lb model gc is the inter component strength and controls the fluid fluid interfacial tension gc needs to be calibrated to macroscopic interfacial tension we now present results of the static droplet test for a 2d two phase oil and water system 201 lu 201 lu with the mesh size of 1 26 10 4 m 1 lu and the periodic bcs are used in the calibration the relaxation times are 1 0 and 1 0 for the water and oil phases respectively initially a square oil droplet ρ o m3 was placed at the center of the water phase ρ w m3 due to the interfacial tension the square oil droplet tends to form a circular bubble to minimize the interfacial energy fig 3 a shows the oil density profile after 13 2s the young laplace equation describes the relationship between the radius of the bubble and the pressure difference across the interface and it is written as 26 δ p γ r where r is the radius of the circular bubble δp is the pressure difference across the two phase interface and γ is the interfacial tension eq 26 shows that δp is linearly proportional to the inverse of the radius with the slope of γ by varying the initial size of the square oil droplet circular bubble with a different radius can be formed we used gc 2 5 to calibrate the inter component strength to the interfacial tension fig 3 b shows the linear relationship between δp and 1 r and the slope of this straight line is two times of the interfacial tension thus gc 2 5 corresponds with the interfacial tension of 45 4mn m this numerical test not only calibrated the interfacial tension but also validated our code 4 4 capillarity effects of micro tubes of different sizes in order to investigate the capillarity effect we designed a simulation scenario of a drainage process three open channels connecting the inlet and the outlet with different widths are placed the widths are 20 µm 30 µm and 40 µm respectively initially the channels are saturated with the oil phase with ρ oi 1000kg m3 and the channels are assumed to be the oil wet g o a d s g w a d s 0 2 the water phase starts to inject into these three channels with a constant pressure we have simulated two cases with different outlet pressures in case 1 fig 4 a the outlet pressure is set to be pout 0 99pin the water phase enters the two larger channels and eventually displaces out the entire oil phase but it becomes stagnant in the smallest channel because this pressure gradient is not sufficient to overcome the capillarity effect we then adjusted the outlet pressure to pout 0 991pin in case 2 fig 4 b the water phase can still enter the largest channel and is still stagnant in the smallest channel however since the outlet pressure is increased the pressure difference is no longer adequate to drive the water phase to displace the oil phase in the middle channel 5 two phase displacement in different types of porous media in this section a water phase displacing an oil phase is simulated in three types of porous media i e a pure porous medium a porous medium with isolated vugs and a porous medium with connected vugs fracture to investigate the effects of vug connectivity on multiphase flows note that the irreducible water and residual oil saturations are immobile and don t contribute mass transfer in the macroscopic view in the following simulations we compute the floodable parts of fluids in lbm and the total saturations can be achieved by including floodable saturations the irreducible and residual saturations 5 1 multiphase flow in a porous channel in this case we simulate two phase flow displacement the water phase displacing the oil phase in a two dimensional porous channel the channel width and length are 50 lu and 150 lu with the mesh size of 10 µm respectively the porous media is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic and the porosity is uniformly 0 3 in this porous channel initially the oil phase saturation is 0 8 with a residual oil saturation sor 0 2 and the irreducible water saturation swi 0 2 the oil density is ρ o 800kg m3 in the porous domain and the pressure bc is applied at the inlet i e ρ w in m3 the combined pressure and convective outflow bc was applied on the outlet layer i e pout 0 8 pin the top and bottom of the channel are set with the non slip bc half way bounce back the relaxation times for both the oil and water phases are 1 0 in this test the inter component interaction strength is gc 2 5 repulsive force and the fluid rock interaction strengths are g o a d s g w a d s 0 fig 4 shows the progress of the water phase displacing the oil phase at different times 0 04s 0 36s and 0 61s the displacement is piston like and the water front is nearly flat with a very low curvature due to the non slip boundary condition on the upper and lower boundaries fig 6 is a plot of the water oil interface position against the simulation time according to the darcy s law the average fluid speed in a homogeneous porous channel is a constant value the average velocity can be approximated by calculating the slope of the interface against the simulation time in fig 6 it shows that the slope of the interface position or the darcy velocity is approximately 10 3m s and the breakthrough time is approximately 0 65 s 5 2 multiphase flow in isolated vuggy porous media large void spaces such as multi scale vugs are frequently observed in carbonate karst formations as a result of mineral dissolution the presence of large sized vugs in porous media might alter the multiphase transport behavior because fluids behave differently in vugs than in matrix pores the fluid flow is dominated by the drag forces in the porous matrix but it is dominated by the viscous force and the inter component force in vugs due to porosity variations in different flow regions the proposed grayscale multiphase lb model switches the dominating forces and no effort is needed to determine the complex boundary conditions between two types of porosity systems in this simulation case we placed three square vugs 300 µm 300 µm in the same porous channel described in section 5 1 the porosities for the porous media and vugs are 0 3 and 1 0 respectively the initial condition boundary conditions and simulation parameters are the same as those presented in section 5 1 fig 7 shows the oil density distribution at different times 0 0233s 0 150s and 0 261 s in the displacement the water phase tends to displace the oil phase in the vugs prior to the oil phase in the matrix so the water oil interface front travels more quickly in the vugs than in the porous matrix because there are no drag forces in the rock matrix in the vugs fig 8 shows the water oil interface position vs the simulation time this plot is slightly curvier than the plot shown in fig 6 indicating that the interface movement alternatively shifts between higher and lower speeds the interface front travels at a faster speed when it encounters a vug and it slows down when it passes the entire vug the average speed of the interface front is approximately 5 7 10 3m s and the breakthrough time is 0 26 s fig 7 c shows the oil density profile after breakthrough as seen the outlet boundary condition works well for the interface smoothly propagating out the exit 5 3 multiphase flow in connected vuggy fractured porous media the next case we consider is multiphase flow in connected vuggy porous media connected vugs form high flow channels that can also be viewed as dissolution enlarged fractures we have previously investigated the impact of fractures on single phase flows in naturally fractured shale digital rocks and we found that the permeability was increased by order of magnitudes due to the fractures ning et al 2016 however the impact of connected vugs or fracture on multiphase flow is still a challenging problem zhang et al 2005 reported that a significant fraction of porosity for vuggy carbonates was contributed by connected vugs and the transport properties were significantly different in connected vuggy carbonates in this case we simulated the water phase displacing the oil phase in the porous media penetrated by connected vugs with the width of 170 µm the porosities for the matrix and the vugs are 0 3 and 1 0 respectively all simulation conditions and parameters are the same with those in the previous two cases fig 9 shows the oil phase density at different moments 1 67 10 4 s 2 5 10 3 s and 6 67 10 3 s the interface travels much faster in the connected vugs than that in the matrix in addition we have observed the diffusive two phase interface near the boundary of the fracture this diffusive behavior keeps the simulation stable for systems with a large contrast of resistance forces in the fig 10 we plotted the position of the oil water interface front against the simulation time the front travels quickly at the early period due to the sudden imposition of the pressure bc and the slight fluid compressibility and behaves linearly with time when the steady state is reached the average velocity of the interface front is approximately s and the breakthrough occurs at 6 67 10 3 s table 1 shows a comparison of the interface front speed and the breakthrough time among the above three cases the speed of the interface front in the isolated vuggy case is more than two times than that in the non vuggy case and the breakthrough time is 60 less the comparison between the isolated vuggy case and the connected vuggy case shows that the speed of interface front moves more than 38 times faster in the connected vuggy porous media and the breakthrough is much shorter which is attributed to the vug connectivity 6 two phase displacement in real vuggy carbonate core samples we now consider multiphase flow in real vuggy carbonate cores two carbonate core samples were imaged using low resolution µ ct and high resolution µ ct respectively fig 11 a shows the image of a carbonate core plug 2 5 cm in diameter using low resolution µ ct with the imaging resolution of 31 5 µm vugs with various sizes ranging from hundertmal micrometers to millimeters are shown in black due to the low attenuation coefficient the rock matrix with micro porosity is shown in dark gray and the bright material is possibly pyrite or feldspar with very low porosity fig 11 b shows the image of a carbonate mini core 3 7 mm in diameter using high resolution µ ct with the imaging resolution of 4 µm micro vugs are shown in black the dolomite mineral is shown in dark gray and the rest of the minerals with high attenuation coefficients are shown in light gray in the two carbonate cores the vug sizes range from a few microns to one millimeter the multi scale vuggy feature in carbonate is distinct from other sedimentary rocks including sandstone and shale fig 12 a and b show the segmented images of the subsets from the same carbonate sample with low µ ct resolution 31 5 µm based on the multi thresholding otsu algorithm otsu 1979 in which one threshold value is used to separate the vugs green and the homogeneous matrix brown as seen in fig 12 a and two threshold values are used to separate the vugs green the high porosity matrix light green and the low porosity matrix white as seen in fig 12 b as seen in fig 12 c the segmented image extracted from the high resolution µ ct sample shows that most of the vugs are isolated fig 12 d shows a segmented image containing vugs of various sizes in which a portion of the vugs form a channel that connects the left and the right ends in addition according to multiple gray value watersheds we segmented out four components using the multi thresholding otsu algorithm including vugs green the high porosity matrix brown the low porosity matrix white and the impermeable matrix black for the carbonate mini core in the simulations discussed below we investigated the effects of rock matrix heterogeneity vug connectivity and rock wetting preference on two phase displacement the irreducible water and residual oil saturations are assumed to be 0 2 for porous matrix in the following simulations 6 1 effect of matrix heterogeneity on the vuggy carbonate samples excluding multi scale vugs the porosity in carbonate is mainly due to the matrix pores and it presents strong heterogeneity diverse pore types and pore sizes can be found in different minerals that usually reflect different gray values in a µ ct image in this section we investigate the effect of matrix heterogeneity on two phase displacement for the vuggy carbonate samples seen in fig 12 a and b for the porosity distribution we set 1 0 for the vug spaces in both samples 0 28 for the homogeneous matrix and 0 375 and 0 05 for the heterogeneous matrix respectively the total porosity for both cases is maintained as 0 32 the mesh size is 300 lu 700 lu 22 05 mm 9 45 mm for both cases the initial density of the oil phase is ρ o 800 kg m3 the non slip half way bounce back boundary condition is applied for the upper and the lower boundaries the pressure boundary condition is applied for the inlet i e ρ w in 1000 kg m3 and the combined pressure and convective boundary condition is applied for the outlet i e pout 0 8 pin the oil water viscosity ratio is 2 i e ν o 2 ν w 2 10 6m2 s the fluid fluid interaction strength is gc 2 5 and the fluid rock interaction strength is g o a d s g w a d s 0 indicating that the vuggy carbonates are neutral wet to two immiscible phases figs 13 and 14 show the time series snapshots of the two phase distributions at different water saturations for the homogeneous and heterogeneous cases respectively the homogeneous case presents a piston like displacement although the water phase is preferably displacing the oil phase in the vug spaces which is mainly attributed to matrix homogeneity and vuggy isolation while displacement fingering is obvious in the heterogeneous case it will become less noticeable if the porosity contrast in the matrix is reduced fig 15 shows a comparison of the water phase mass fractional flow curves between the homogeneous and the heterogeneous cases fw ft is the ratio of the water phase mass flow rate over the total flow rate at the outlet of the two vuggy carbonate samples in the homogeneous case a significant jump of fw ft occurs at sw 0 75 whereas in the heterogeneous case fw ft starts increasing largely at sw 0 55 6 2 effect of vug connectivity on the vuggy carbonate samples previous studies have reported that carbonate rocks with isolated vugs showed a homogeneous behavior compared with carbonate rocks with connected vugs egermann et al 2007 vik et al 2012 connectivity in vuggy carbonates significantly alters the multiphase flow mechanism because connected vugs form high flow channels where fluids prefer to flow zhang et al 2005 now we consider two phase fluids flowing through carbonate rocks with isolated and connected vugs i e fig 12 c and d the porosity distribution can be found in fig 12 for both samples with the same total porosity of 0 34 the mesh size is 650 lu 300 lu 2 6 mm 1 2 mm for both cases ν o ν w 2 gc 2 5 and g o a d s g w a d s 0 are set in simulations same initial and boundary conditions with those presented in section 6 1 are applied figs 16 and 17 show the two phase displacement progress at different water saturations for the isolated vuggy case and the connected vuggy case respectively the interface front travels much faster in the connected vuggy case than in the isolated vuggy case because the two phase fluids encounter much less resistivity in the high flow channel fig 18 shows a comparison of the outlet water phase mass fractional flow curves between the isolated vuggy case and the connected vuggy case it can be found that fw ft has a quick jump at sw 0 31 for the connected case which indicates the water phase front reaches the outlet of the sample by contrast fw ft starts increasing significantly at sw 0 49 for the isolated vuggy case indicating the water phase breaking through this sample 6 3 effect of rock wettability on the vuggy carbonate samples in the above cases we neglected the effect of capillarity but we focused on the effect of geometric heterogeneity due to the vugs in this test we included the rock wetting preferences to investigate the effect of rock wettability on the two phase displacement we considered the heterogeneous rock sample shown in fig 12 b for this investigation with two wetting cases water wet and oil wet in the water wet case g w a d s 0 05 and g o a d s 0 05 are for the water phase and the oil phase respectively g w a d s 0 05 and g o a d s 0 05 are set in the oil wet case the initial conditions the boundary conditions the rock properties and other simulation parameters are the same as those used in the simulations shown in fig 14 fig 19 a and c show the snapshots of the water oil distribution at the same water saturation sw 0 434 for the two wetting cases fig 19 b and d show the snapshots of the water oil distribution at the same simulation time 9 5 s for the two wetting cases the differences in the two cases shown in fig 19 are summarized as follows first it takes 6 s for the oil wet case to reach the water saturation of 0 434 whereas it only takes 4 s for the water wet case to reach the same water saturation using the same simulation time 9 5 s the water saturation is 0 566 for the oil wet case and 0 656 for the water wet case these observations indicate that the water displacement is more efficient if the vuggy carbonate is water wet second the water phase tends to displace the oil phase in vugs for the oil wet case because it undergoes less resistance in the vugs however the opposite is true for the water wet case because the attractive force in the rock matrix drives the water phase to displace the oil phase in the matrix this indicates that the regions being displaced are significantly dependent on the rock wetting preferences in addition the displacement fingering is more obvious in the oil wet case than the water wet case fig 20 shows a comparison of the water mass fractional flow at the outlet between the oil wet and water wet cases the oil wet fractional flow is higher than the water wet fractional flow for most of the water saturations a significant increase in fw ftotal can be observed at sw 0 52 for the oil wet case and sw 0 61 for the water wet case residual oil distribution is perhaps one of the most concerning aspects of water flooding processes we now consider three rock wetting preferences by adjusting the fluid solid interaction forces include water wet g w ads g o a d s 0 05 weak oil wet g o ads g w a d s 0 05 and strong oil wet g o ads g w a d s 0 2 fig 21 shows the residual oil distributions at sw 0 68 for these three cases the computational times for 68 displacement efficiency are 10 5 s 17 2 s and 91 8 s for the water wet weak oil wet and strong oil wet cases respectively the residual oil distribution is significantly different among the three cases especially between the water wet case and the strong oil wet case for the most part the oil that is not displaced remains in the rock matrix for the two oil wet cases in the water wet case it remains in both the rock matrix and the vugs 7 conclusions this study developed a unified grayscale multiphase lb model for multiphase fluid flows in vuggy carbonates the formulation of this model is based on combining the generalized lb model in porous media with the pseudo potential multiphase lb model in the proposed model we considered both the linear and the nonlinear drag effects due to the porous matrix so it has the potential to simulate multiphase fluid flow in porous media with a variety of porosity systems the total force acting on the fluids contains the drag forces due to the porous matrix the fluid fluid interaction force and the fluid solid interaction force the proposed model automatically switches the flow regimes in different flow regions porosity systems without incorporating complex boundary conditions in vuggy carbonates consisting of both a porous matrix and significantly larger vugs the unified grayscale multiphase lb model is reduced to the standard pseudo potential multiphase lb model in vugs when the vug porosity is 1 0 and it recovers to the multiphase darcy model or the multiphase forcheimer non darcy model based on the matrix porosity in the porous matrix note that though the current model can recover different macroscopic equations for different flow regimes it still remains some limitations discussed in section 3 in addition we presented a combined pressure and convective outflow boundary condition for pressure driven multiphase flows in order to predict the unknown physics from the simulation domain in the numerical experiments we first validated the grayscale lbm results with the analytical single phase solutions of the darcy brinkman equation then we validated the multiphase flow results with the analytical buckley leverett solutions in a nearly piston like displacement we also calibrated the inter component strength in relation to the interfacial tension for a static oil droplet surrounded by the water phase and investigated the capillarity effects of water displacing oil in tubes of different sizes next we simulated two phase flows for three types of porous media i e non vuggy porous media purely porous matrix isolated vuggy porous media and connected vuggy fractured porous media and then we analyzed the speed of the interface front and the breakthrough time the interface front travels almost linearly as simulation time for the non vuggy porous media and the connected vuggy porous media nonlinearity was found for the isolated vuggy porous media in addition we found that the average speed of the interface front in the isolated vuggy case is more than two times faster than the speed in the non vuggy case and the breakthrough time is 60 less the comparison of the isolated vuggy and the connected vuggy cases showed that the speed of the interface front is 38 times faster in the connected vuggy porous media for the next case two real vuggy carbonate samples were imaged using low resolution µ ct and high resolution µ ct for simulating the water phase displacing the oil phase we considered four vuggy samples to investigate the effects of rock matrix heterogeneity vug connectivity and rock matrix wetting preferences two phase displacement through the four samples was carried out we found that a piston like displacement occurred in the homogeneous case whereas obvious fingering effects were observed in the heterogeneous case the water phase mass fractional flow fw ft at the outlet showed that a significant jump in fw ft occurred at sw 0 75 in the homogeneous case in the heterogeneous case fw ft increased significantly at sw 0 55 a comparison of the isolated and connected cases showed that the interface front travels much faster in the connected vuggy carbonate because the connected high flow channel did not introduce any rock drag forces to both fluid phases fw ft had a quick jump at sw 0 31 for the connected vuggy case this indicates that the water phase reached the sample outlet in the isolated case fw ft started increasing significantly sw 0 49 moreover we investigated the effect of rock matrix wetting preference on the multiphase flow behavior in the heterogeneous vuggy carbonate sample it was found that the displacement times were 50 longer in order to reach sw 0 434 for the oil wet case than the water wet case for the same moment of water displacement i e 9 5 s the water saturation was 0 566 for the oil wet case and 0 656 for the water wet case indicating the water displacement is more efficient if the vuggy carbonate is water wet the mass fractional flow was found to be higher in the oil wet case for most of the water saturations a significant increase in fw ftotal was observed at sw 0 52 for the oil wet case and sw 0 61 for the water wet case finally we investigated the residual oil distribution for different types of rock wettability at the same displacement efficiency 68 the computational times were 10 5 s 17 2 s and 91 8 s for the water wet weak oil wet and strong oil wet cases respectively the oil that was not displaced remained mainly in the rock matrix for the oil wet cases and it remained in both the rock matrix and the vugs for the water wet case in the future we will work on the incorporation of realistic pore scale relative permeability with the inclusion of rock wettability beyond the scope of piston like displacement process in porous matrix elements and then recover the relative permeability and capillary pressure curves for whole core scale three dimensional 3d vuggy carbonates acknowledgments this research is supported in partial by us national science foundation through

application 1 appendix a boundary condition treatments for multiphase lbm fig a illustrates three boundary types including the solid boundary the inlet boundary and the outlet boundary a 1 bounce back boundary condition the bounce back bc is a widely used model in lbm for treating stationary solid boundaries ensuring a non slip velocity on solid boundaries the bounce back scheme assumes that particles stream to a solid node and then bounce back to the node it came from among bounce back schemes the half way bounce back has second order accuracy as well as easy implementation the half way bounce back bc for the fluid nodes at the ny 1 layer can be expressed as a1 f σ 4 7 8 x n y 1 t δ t f σ 2 5 6 x n y 1 t where f tilde is the post collision distribution function the unknown f σ 4 7 8 after the streaming step are obtained through the bounce back rule a 2 periodic boundary condition the periodic bc is useful when the flow domain can be assumed to be infinitely long the periodic bc means that particles flowing out of the computational domain on one side of the boundary will flow into the domain on the other side at next time step taking the inlet and the outlet boundaries in x direction as an example we have a2 f σ 1 5 8 0 y t δ t f σ 1 5 8 n x y t f σ 3 6 7 n x y t δ t f σ 3 6 7 0 y t where nx is the outlet boundary node in x direction for many multiphase lbm simulations in porous media the inlet and outlet bcs are set to periodic and fluids are driven to flow by an external force a 3 pressure boundary condition in two phase immiscible displacement processes the periodic bc is not always proper as the displacement domain is finite the pressure bc is common for immiscible displacement both experimentally and numerically for example given the pressure or the fluid density on the inlet layer x 0 f σ 1 f σ 5 f σ 8 and ux σ are unknowns assuming u y σ 0 after the streaming step zou and he 1997 proposed the bounce back rule for the non equilibrium parts of the distribution function normal to the flow boundary as a3 f σ 1 0 y t f σ 1 e q 0 y t f σ 3 0 y t f σ 3 e q 0 y t the unknown distribution functions f σ 1 f σ 5 f σ 8 and u x σ can be solved using eqs 2 5 and 6 and a3 similarly the velocity bc can also be implemented using the non equilibrium bounce back scheme a 4 outflow boundary condition for immiscible displacement processes the inflow bcs are usually given in terms of pressure or flow rate and the type of injecting fluid is also known however the outflow bc is not straightforward in lbm for multiphase flows since the physics outside the computational domain is not known lou et al 2013 presented a convective bc for velocity driven two phase flows here we adopt the convective bc and present an outflow bc for pressure driven immiscible flows let s consider the following scenario for demonstration the entire core sample is initially saturated with the oil phase then the water phase is injected from the inlet with pressure p i n c s 2 ρ w as ρ o 0 and the outlet pressure is fixed at pout pin according to eq 8 though pout can be given for computation the densities of oil and water phases at the outlet layer are still not known we apply the convective bc on water as its density at the outlet layer is very small compared with the oil density before water breakthrough a4 f w α t u w f w α x 0 x n x where uw is the water phase velocity normal to the outlet lou et al 2013 evaluated three choices of uw including local average and maximum velocities at the nx 1 layer and observed good outputs for all three choices eq a4 can be discretized using first order finite difference and be written in an implicit form as a5 f w α n x y t δ t f w α n x y t λ f w α n x 1 y t δ t 1 λ where λ u w n x 1 t δ t δ t δ x in this work we choose the average water density of the nx 1 layer at t δ t after the streaming step i e u w n x 1 t δ t 1 n y 1 y u x w n x 1 y t δ t all quantities on the right hand side of eq a5 are known after the streaming step consequently the water phase density ρ w nx can be calculated with the solved water phase distribution functions and the oil phase density is then calculated by eq 8 as ρ o n x p o u t c s 2 ρ w n x g c ρ w n x applying the non equilibrium bounce back scheme discussed in section a 3 we can solve all unknown distribution functions for the oil phase at the nx layer this combined

702,in addition to intrinsic matrix pores ranging in size from submicrons to microns vuggy carbonates often contain significantly larger vug spaces immiscible multiphase fluids flowing through this type of microporous systems exhibit complicated flow mechanisms that are involved in the interactions between multiphase fluids and different types of pore spaces modeling multiphase fluid flows requires using the appropriate governing equations for different porosity systems more specifically while multiphase darcy s equations might hold for a matrix system they are not applicable for a vug system to improve understanding this difficult multiphase flow problem in vuggy carbonates we developed a unified grayscale lattice boltzmann lb model for multiphase flows the proposed model combines the generalized lb model in porous media with the pseudo potential multiphase approach by adding the fluid fluid interaction force the fluid solid interaction force and the linear and nonlinear drag forces induced by the porous matrix the model is still within the framework of the generalized lb model and it switches freely from the darcy s regime to the free flow regime via rock property i e porosity it can also extend to a wide range of porosity systems because we incorporated both the linear and nonlinear drag effects a continuous flow interface between the porous matrix and the vug region is captured by simulation without incorporating complex interface boundary conditions between the two porosity systems the current model is validated and calibrated with theory and then it is applied to a number of test cases the test cases include the simulations of two phase displacement in non vuggy porous media isolated vuggy porous media and connected vuggy fractured porous media moreover the effect of vug spaces on the interface front speed and the breakthrough time is investigated in addition we simulated water displacing oil in two real vuggy carbonate cores imaged using low resolution and high resolution x ray computed microtomography and we investigated the effects of matrix heterogeneity vug connectivity and matrix wetting preference keywords vuggy carbonate multiphase flow lattice boltzmann method grayscale model 1 introduction carbonate is an important conventional resource because it contributes a significant proportion of the world s total hydrocarbon reserves and daily hydrocarbon production unlike most sandstone reservoirs which are relatively homogeneous single porosity systems carbonate reservoirs are characterized by a highly heterogeneous microporous system newberry et al 1996 yao et al 2015 the microporous system is often classified as primary porosity and secondary porosity which are attributed to various diagenetic and geologic processes primary porosity which we will refer to as micro porosity is formed by deposition it is associated with the original depositional texture of the sediment primary pores are usually at the submicron scale to micron scale including intergranular pores intra particle pores and inter crystalline pores anselmetti et al 1998 secondary porosity is formed by post depositional dissolution vug is a common type of secondary porosity it can be further divided into isolated vugs and connected vugs isolated vugs are separate pore spaces that are connected through intergranular pores connected vugs form high flow channels that can be viewed as dissolution enlarged fractures in addition to stress induced fractures vik et al 2012 zhang et al 2005 analyzed a carbonate sample using x ray computed tomography ct and reported that 64 of the total pore volume was in vugs and 36 was in matrix pore spaces based on advanced micro computed tomography µ ct analysis of carbonate core samples arns et al 2005 identified a broad size distribution for vugs ranging from a few microns to millimeters the broad variety of pore space sizes in a microporous system distinguishes the petrophysical properties of carbonates from most other types of reservoir rocks including sandstone and shale one of the most important petrophysical properties of carbonates is the relative permeability of two fluid phases in order to improve the prediction and producibility of enhanced oil recovery in carbonate reservoirs it is necessary to enhance the understanding of the multiphase flow mechanism in this type of microporous medium as a prerequisite step for reservoir formation evaluation and reservoir simulation core analysis identifies the important petrophysical properties of the targeted reservoir in carbonate reservoirs with complex spatial heterogeneity obtaining physical core flooding measurements under different boundary conditions can easily take months or even longer and the process is often expensive and non repeatable mcphee et al 2015 alternatively with advances in high resolution imaging techniques numerical flow simulations on image based core samples have recently become a reliable and fast tool for characterizing petrophysical properties dvorkin et al 2008 crawshaw and boek 2013 anderson 2014 typically in imaging techniques as the image pixel resolution increases the total image size decreases and vice versa thus it is contradictory to resolve submicron micron pore spaces and also include significantly larger vugs in a single resolution image arns et al 2005 pore scale multiphase simulations cannot ensure the representativeness of highly vuggy carbonate cores and they are unable to explain the effects of various sized vugs to increase the sample size in order to include vug spaces and reach the representative volume one has to use coarser imaging resolution and expect some loss of detail such as less information about microporosity and the mineral components in coarse resolution carbonate rocks multiphase flow modeling is more challenging than pore scale simulation due to factors such as the interactions between the reservoir fluids and the microporous systems egermann et al 2007 wu et al 2006 kang et al 2002 kang et al 2006 zhang et al 2016 yao et al 2010 it is necessary to consider the mass transfer both within the same type of porosity system i e within the matrix pores and within the vugs and between the different types of porosity systems i e between the matrix pores and the vugs zhang et al 2018 macroscopic scale equations based on darcy s law are applicable for multiphase flows in well sorted reservoir rocks but the validity is questionable in highly heterogeneous vuggy carbonates as a class of computational fluid dynamics methods the lattice boltzmann method lbm arises from the molecular kinetic theory and it tracks the evolution of the particle density distribution function lbm is a good candidate for modeling fluid flows in complex geometries due to its simplicity of treating the boundary conditions chen et al 2013 liu et al 2016 as more advanced imaging and computing resources become available it has been possible to perform direct simulations in reconstructed digital pore structures using highly efficient parallelization procedures rinaldi et al 2012 zhou et al 2012 chen et al 2018 furthermore for multiphase flows in porous media lbm usually automatically computes the fluid fluid interfaces without explicitly tracking them porter et al 2009 liu et al 2016 several multiphase lattice boltzmann lb models have been developed over the past two decades including the color gradient model gunstensen et al 1991 the pseudopotential model shan and chen 1993 and the free energy model swift et al 1995 the previous multiphase lb models have been well applied to mimic the complex drainage and imbibition process to recover multiphase properties at pore scale hao and cheng 2010 boek and venturoli 2010 liu et al 2016 however for carbonates with heterogeneous vug spaces that are significantly larger than matrix pores a detailed description of the micro pore geometry is unavailable in a lower resolution ct scanned core sample therefore to investigate the transport properties in vuggy carbonates vug scale flow models also referred to as grayscale models are needed to retain both the vug spaces and the important rock matrix properties grayscale lb models of single phase flows have been developed for heterogeneous porous media spaid and phelan 1997 dardis and mccloskey 1998 freed 1998 martys 2001 guo and zhao 2002 benamram et al 2016 the grayscale models allow a certain degree of flow for all of the simulation elements and they differ from the black white models that classify a simulation element as being either solid or void grayscale multiphase lb models for vuggy carbonates are currently lacking in the literature except for studies conducted by zalzale et al 2016 and pereira 2016 the grayscale model development for multiphase flows involves great challenges which are summarized as follows first multiphase flows in vugs are dominated by viscous force and fluid fluid interfacial tension however the controlling force in a matrix becomes the drag forces due to the rock grains thus it is very challenging to simultaneously implement proper transport equations for different flow regions in vuggy porous media second when modeling multiphase flows through vuggy core samples it is difficult to satisfy the interface conditions between different types of porosity systems because they involve not only the continuity of the fluid velocities and the shear stresses but also the effects of geometric heterogeneity in this work we aim to develop a unified grayscale multiphase lattice boltzmann model to simulate multiphase flows for vuggy carbonates recently zalzale et al 2016 proposed a gray multiphase lb model that combines the free energy lb model with the partial bounce back approach however their model focused on single component two phase systems which limits its applications in immiscible two phase flow problems pereira 2016 proposed an lb model for immiscible multiphase flow through heterogeneous porous media by combining the pseudo potential lb model with the single phase grayscale model to yield a multiphase lb that study successfully simulated two phase flow in real sandstone samples the models proposed by zalzale et al 2016 and pereira 2016 assumed partial bounce back at each lattice node where the partial coefficient is related to the solid fraction in a particular voxel thus they assumed that the degree of fluid particles passing through a rock voxel is linearly dependent on the porosity which remains questionable for some reservoir rocks in this work we extend the idea of the generalized lb proposed in guo and zhao 2002 to multiphase systems by coupling the pseudo potential multiphase approach yielding a grayscale multiphase lb model we adopt the forcing scheme developed by he et al 1998 because the forcing scheme in guo and zhao s 2002 original work was designed for single phase flows we incorporate both the porous medium s linear darcy and nonlinear forcheimer drag effects on different fluid components into the model the total force for a fluid component contains the fluid fluid interaction force the drag forces due to the porous matrix and the fluid solid interaction force if wettability is considered for a simulation element representing the fine grained porous matrix the proposed grayscale lb model is reduced to the multiphase darcy model if the porous matrix is coarse grained this model is reduced to the multiphase forcheimer model for a simulation element representing vug space free flow region our grayscale lb model returns to the original pseudo potential multiphase lb model a diffusive interface between the porous matrix and the vug space is computed automatically without incorporating complex interface boundary conditions this paper is structured as follows first we discuss the formulation and development of the proposed lb model second we briefly review some of the common boundary condition bc treatments in lbm and we present an outflow bc for pressure driven multiphase flows in the appendix third the model validation and calibration are discussed to address some benchmark problems next we present two phase simulations for different types of porous media including a pure porous matrix an isolated vuggy porous media and a connected vuggy fractured porous media then two vuggy carbonate cores are imaged using low resolution µ ct and high resolution µ ct we simulate multiphase flows in two dimensional 2d vuggy carbonate cores and we investigate the effects of matrix heterogeneity and vug connectivity on multiphase behavior the effect of matrix wetting preference is also investigated by considering the rock fluid interaction in addition we compare the mass fraction flow at the outlet for all cases and the residual oil distribution for different wetting preferences the conclusions are presented in the final section of this paper 2 model formulation the pseudo potential multiphase lb model also known as the shan chen model was first proposed by shan and chen 1993 in the shan chen model each fluid component has a set of distribution functions that relax to the equilibrium states at their corresponding rates for an immiscible multiphase system phase separation or aggregation occurs when introducing a repulsive or attractive force into fluid particles the inter particle interaction force is modeled by a pseudo potential function that assumes it exists non local interaction between fluid particles and a green function determines the interaction strength between fluid particles the pseudo potential multiphase lattice boltzmann equation is expressed as 1 f σ α x e α δ t t δ t f σ α x t f σ α x t f σ α e q x t τ σ 1 1 2 τ σ δ t f σ α where f σ α and f σ α e q are the distribution function and the equilibrium distribution function for the σth component respectively x and t are the spatial and temporal indices respectively and δ t is the temporal spacing for the d2q9 model the discrete particle velocity e α is given as e 0 0 0 e α cos α 1 π 2 sin α 1 π 2 for α 1 4 and e α 2 cos 2 α 1 π 4 2 sin 2 α 1 π 4 for α 5 8 τσ is the dimensionless relaxation time for the σth component and it relates the fluid viscosity through ν σ 1 3 τ σ 0 5 the equilibrium distribution function is defined as 2 f σ α e q x t ω α ρ σ 1 e α u eq c s 2 e α u eq 2 2 c s 4 u eq u eq 2 c s 2 where cs is the speed of sound ωα is the weighting factor defined as ω0 4 9 ω1 4 1 9 and ω5 8 1 36 f σ α is the discrete forcing term derived directly from the continuous boltzmann equation he et al 1998 and it has the form 3 f σ α f σ e α u eq ρ σ c s 2 f σ α e q where f σ contains all external forces and body forces u eq is the equilibrium velocity that is described by an effective velocity for the fluid mixture porter et al 2012 as 4 u eq σ ρ σ u σ τ σ σ ρ σ τ σ the macroscopic density and velocity for each component can be calculated as 5 ρ σ α f σ α 6 u σ α f σ α e α τ σ f σ ρ σ the total velocity of the fluid mixture and the pressure are 7 u σ ρ σ u σ σ ρ σ and 8 p c s 2 σ ρ σ 1 2 c s 2 g c σ σ ρ σ ρ σ notice that the original shan chen multiphase model and the later improved model by shan and doolen 1995 do not include the forcing term in the distribution evolution function namely no last term in eq 1 instead forces are incorporated into the equilibrium distribution function by shifting macroscopic velocity according to newton s second law the shan chen and shan doolen models have achieved great success in simulating multiphase flow in porous media but researchers have reported several limitations including numerical instabilities for large density ratios numerical instabilities for large kinematic viscosity ratios viscosity dependent equilibrium densities etc porter et al 2012 more importantly guo and zhao 2009 pointed out that the forcing scheme in the shan chen and the shan doolen models resulted in hydrodynamic equations that are inconsistent with navier stokes equations the forcing scheme appeared in eq 1 recovers the navier stokes equations with an additional term of ϑ u 3 through the chapman enskog expansion fluid flows in porous media are low mach number flows so the ϑ u 3 term is negligible in eq 3 f σ is the total force acting on the σth component and includes a fluid fluid interaction force f σ c defined as 9 f σ c g c ψ σ x t α ω e α 2 ψ σ x e α δ t t e α where σ and σ represent two different fluid components ψσ is the interparticle potential or the effective mass gc is the fluid fluid interaction strength that controls the interfacial tension and fluid miscibility positive for a repulsive force and negative for an attractive force ψσ is a function of local density and is usually set as ψσ ρσ for binary mixtures note that eq 9 is the finite difference discretization of g c ψ σ ψ σ on discrete lattice nodes so increasing the number of neighboring lattice nodes can increase the isotropy order of the fluid fluid interaction force as a result the spurious current a non physical velocity field in the vicinity of the fluid interface is significantly reduced at a higher order of isotropy chen et al 2014 in this work we use two neighboring layers of fluid nodes to discretize the fluid fluid interaction force ensuring up to 8th order tensor isotropy up to now the above discussions remain the standard multiphase lb model that relies upon the clear description of geometrical shape for flow regions however vuggy carbonates contain pore spaces that are sometimes varying from submicrons to centimeters so it is impossible to include all fine scale matrix pores in a macro scale simulation therefore the development of the grayscale multiphase model retaining both larger scale vug spaces and the properties of fine scale matrix pores is critical in this study similar with the work in guo and zhao 2002 we redefine f σ α and f σ α e q for eq 1 as the volume averaged distribution function and the equilibrium distribution function for the σth component at the representative elementary volume rev scale respectively the eq 1 becomes 10 f σ α x e α δ t t δ t f σ α x t f σ α x t f σ α e q x t τ σ 1 1 2 τ σ δ t f σ α notice that the volume averaging is just a conceptual averaging on every cartesian lattice and no averaging effort is needed in real simulations also all variables appeared in eq 10 remain the same forms of eqs 1 9 but they are volume averaged quantities therefore we neglect the overbars for convenience in order to include the effect of the porous medium we need to define external forces for fluids including drag forces induced by the porous matrix guo and zhao 2002 defined the drag forces in porous matrix for single phase flows for a multiphase system inspired by the previous studies schulenberg and muller 1987 evans and evans 1988 liu et al 1995 wu 2002 we define an external force due to the porous matrix f σ p m on the σth component by incorporating both the linear and nonlinear drag forces as 11 f σ p m ϕ ν σ k k σ u σ ϕ η η σ u σ u σ ϕ g σ where φ is the porosity of the porous matrix ϕ ν σ k k σ u σ is the darcy term ϕ η η σ u σ u σ is the no darcy term or the forcheimer term in the case of flowing through packed beds of coarse particles and φg σ is the body force for the σth component though the non darcy term can be neglected for the primary porosity system matrix with submicron micron pores in vuggy carbonates as the fluid velocity is very small we keep this term for model generality k is the intrinsic permeability of the porous matrix η is the intrinsic non darcy coefficient of the porous matrix or sometimes termed as passibility of the porous matrix k σ and ησ are the relative permeability and the passibility for the σth component respectively for many reservoir rocks excluding shale and other tight rocks k and η are usually independent of fluid types and they simply depend on geometric pore structures for example assuming the porous matrix is media filled with uniformly distributed spherical particles the intrinsic permeability k and non darcy coefficient η can be calculated ergun 1952 as 12 k d 2 150 ϕ 3 1 ϕ 2 13 η d 1 75 ϕ 3 1 ϕ where d is the diameter of spherical particles and 150 and 1 75 are two shape parameters for matching the friction factor in packed beds of spherical particles ergun 1952 the relative permeability can have various forms based on fluid fluid interfacial tension rock heterogeneity capillarity of rock the relative permeability k σ and the non darcy coefficient ησ are functions of fluid saturation the simplest forms for k σ and ησ are 14 k σ s σ n 15 η σ s σ n where s σ is the saturation of the σth component defined as the volume of the fluid σ to total pore volume it can be approximated by s σ ρ σ m σ ρ σ m σ ρ σ m σ if assuming the ideal fluid equation of states where m σ is the molecular mass of the component σ summing up the saturation of all fluid phases we get 16 σ s σ 1 note that the exponent n is an empirical constant in eqs 14 and 15 and the forms of relative permeability and non darcy coefficient may vary for different particle beddings different rock types and different wetting preferences if we consider the fluid fluid interaction as described in eq 9 it would be reasonable to use n 1 n 1 indicates that fluid fluid interfacial effect is already included in eqs 14 and 15 which is a double count on the interfacial effect with eq 9 rock wetting preference plays a significant role in core flooding processes if a rock is oil wet the water phase has to overcome capillary force to displace the oil phase whereas for a water wet rock the capillary force becomes a driving force for water displacement in order to include the capillarity we define a force that describes the rock fluid interaction due to rock wetting preference as 17 f σ a d s x t g σ a d s ρ σ x t α ω e α 2 1 ϕ x e α δ t e α where g σ a d s is the rock fluid interaction parameter that can be adjusted for a desired capillarity g σ a d s is positive for non wetting fluid and negative for wetting fluid according to the young laplace law the capillarity is more significant in a smaller capillary tube for two fluid phases generally but not rigorously speaking if a rock s porosity is small the average pore size is likely small and the capillarity should be significant but this is not always true especially for rocks with complex pore morphology if detailed pore morphology is unavailable we approximate the capillarity as a function of porosity for the preliminary attempt in eq 17 it shows that f σ a d s is zero if φ 1 and it becomes larger as φ is reduced eq 17 is different from the adsorption force in black white models chen et al 2014 which include an indicator function as being either 0 or 1 by combining all forces for the σth component the total force f σ becomes 18 f σ ϕ ν σ k k σ u σ ϕ η η σ u σ u σ ϕ g σ 1 ρ σ f σ c f σ a d s substituting eq 18 into eq 6 we can obtain the macroscopic velocity however eq 6 is an implicit form of velocity as f σ also contains velocity terms carefully solving this equation we can obtain the velocity field explicitly as 19 u σ a 2 a 0 2 a 1 a 2 where a 0 a 1 and a 2 are intermediate parameters expressed as 20 a 0 1 2 1 δ t 2 ϕ ν σ k k σ 21 a 1 δ t 2 ϕ η η σ and 22 a 2 α f σ α e α ρ σ δ t 2 ϕ g σ 1 ρ σ f σ c f σ a d s another important topic in lbm is the boundary condition bc treatment generally bcs are given in terms of the macroscopic variables for fluid dynamics problems such as velocity pressure and so on however the basic variable in lbm is the distribution function so it is not always an easy task to solve unknown distributions functions for boundary nodes especially in a multiphase system in appendix we will briefly review some of the common bc schemes in lbm and present a proper pressure bc for the outlet 3 model discussion and limitations from eqs 12 13 and 18 one can see that as ϕ approaches to unity i e in the completely void spaces vugs this grayscale multiphase model is reduced to the standard pseudo potential multiphase model when ϕ is between zero and unity the proposed model returns to the forcheimer multiphase model the proposed model has attractive features as follows first it is still within the framework of the pseudo potential lb model so it is very easy to implement and code second since both the linear darcy and nonlinear forcheimer drag effects are incorporated into the model it is applicable to a wide range of porosity third the interface between the porous matrix and the free flow region is automatically computed without dealing with complex interface conditions however there exists several challenges that the current model is facing and necessary improvements are needed in the future work the model limitations are summarized in the following the current model assumes the micro porosity is assumed to be well connected and multiphase flows in the micro porosity system follows a nearly piston like displacement this assumption causes an important challenge in modeling residual trapping in a matrix element the phase phase interaction of two immiscible phases is modeled by g c ψ σ ψ σ and gc controls the strength of one phase repulsing the other one the coexistence of both phases in one matrix element can be achieved by reducing the phase phase interaction strength but its exact correlations with saturation and other factors are currently unknown in the current model the model is still within the standard lbm framework meaning the recovered macroscopic equations describe compressible flows with the incompressible limits therefore the compressibility effect cannot be eliminated when modeling two phase incompressible flows which results in compressibility errors in the calculation of phase volume fractions saturations the wettability of rock matrix is modeled the rock fluid interaction force in eq 17 and the wetting strength is dependent on gads and φ a contact angle between zero and π can be yielded depending on the values of gads in the current model the rock wetting preference oil wet water wet or neutral wet can be achieved but the exact relation between the contact angle and gads requires future investigations 4 model validation and calibration 4 1 validation of single phase grayscale lb model in this section we first validate our model and code with the analytical solution of the single phase darcy brinkman equation the benchmark problem is that fluid driven by a body force flows between two parallel plates filled with homogeneous porous material the darcy brinkman equation for this flow problem is given by 23 ν e ϕ 2 u g ν k u 0 where g is the body force φ and k are the porosity and permeability of the porous medium ν is the fluid viscosity and ν e is the effective viscosity or the brinkman viscosity assuming the width between the parallel plates is h and the fluid is flowing in y direction we have the analytical solution of eq 23 as 24 u y g k ν 1 cosh b y h 2 cosh b h 2 where b ν ϕ k ν e and ν e is set to be equal with ν here now let s define two dimensionless numbers reynolds number and darcy number as 25 r e h u 0 ν d a k h 2 where u 0 is the velocity in the middle layer for the simulations we set the porosity to be 0 1 and the relaxation time to be 1 0 the reynolds number ranges from 0 00042 to 2 56 and the darcy number ranges from 1e 6 to 0 01 we used 50 lu 50 lu lu stands for the lattice unit in this test the periodic bcs are applied to the inlet and the outlet and the half way bounce back bcs are applied to the parallel walls for non slip velocity boundaries fig 1 shows a comparison between the grayscale lb model results and the analytical solution the comparison shows good agreements for various re and da numbers when the reynolds number and the darcy number are large i e re 2 56 and da 0 01 the solution approaches to the standard poiseuille flow when the reynolds number and the darcy number are very small i e re 0 00042 and da 1e 6 the solutions are almost identical cross the parallel plates regardless of the boundary effects which confirms darcy s law 4 2 validation of multiphase model compared to a buckley leverett solution the buckley leverett b l equation models two phase flow in porous media describing immiscible displacement processes to validate the multiphase model we compare the simulation results with the analytical solution of the b l equation under the similar assumptions in the b l analysis we assume both of the residual oil saturation and the irreducible water saturation to be 0 2 and the displacement is nearly piston like in the lbm simulation the water phase is injected at a constant rate into a porous media of a pseudo 1d domain periodic bcs on two sides in fig 2 the water saturation vs the normalized position is compared between two approaches we can see that the analytical solution of the buckley leverett approach presents a sharp change of the water saturation at the water front our simulated results show the diffusive change at the water front the possible causes for this noticeable discrepancy may be the following 1 assumptions are not identical in both approaches specifically in the b l analysis fluids are assumed to be perfectly incompressible but lbm has non negligible compressibility effects one variable in the b l equation is the water saturation defined as the water volume fraction but lbm computes the phase density at lattices estimation of the water saturation using two phase densities contains errors induced by the compressibility effects 2 numerical diffusion is non negligible numerical diffusion in multiphase lbm can be decreased by incorporating higher order models or refining the mesh size but can never be eliminated 4 3 calibration of the inter component strength to the interfacial tension in the pseudo potential lb model gc is the inter component strength and controls the fluid fluid interfacial tension gc needs to be calibrated to macroscopic interfacial tension we now present results of the static droplet test for a 2d two phase oil and water system 201 lu 201 lu with the mesh size of 1 26 10 4 m 1 lu and the periodic bcs are used in the calibration the relaxation times are 1 0 and 1 0 for the water and oil phases respectively initially a square oil droplet ρ o m3 was placed at the center of the water phase ρ w m3 due to the interfacial tension the square oil droplet tends to form a circular bubble to minimize the interfacial energy fig 3 a shows the oil density profile after 13 2s the young laplace equation describes the relationship between the radius of the bubble and the pressure difference across the interface and it is written as 26 δ p γ r where r is the radius of the circular bubble δp is the pressure difference across the two phase interface and γ is the interfacial tension eq 26 shows that δp is linearly proportional to the inverse of the radius with the slope of γ by varying the initial size of the square oil droplet circular bubble with a different radius can be formed we used gc 2 5 to calibrate the inter component strength to the interfacial tension fig 3 b shows the linear relationship between δp and 1 r and the slope of this straight line is two times of the interfacial tension thus gc 2 5 corresponds with the interfacial tension of 45 4mn m this numerical test not only calibrated the interfacial tension but also validated our code 4 4 capillarity effects of micro tubes of different sizes in order to investigate the capillarity effect we designed a simulation scenario of a drainage process three open channels connecting the inlet and the outlet with different widths are placed the widths are 20 µm 30 µm and 40 µm respectively initially the channels are saturated with the oil phase with ρ oi 1000kg m3 and the channels are assumed to be the oil wet g o a d s g w a d s 0 2 the water phase starts to inject into these three channels with a constant pressure we have simulated two cases with different outlet pressures in case 1 fig 4 a the outlet pressure is set to be pout 0 99pin the water phase enters the two larger channels and eventually displaces out the entire oil phase but it becomes stagnant in the smallest channel because this pressure gradient is not sufficient to overcome the capillarity effect we then adjusted the outlet pressure to pout 0 991pin in case 2 fig 4 b the water phase can still enter the largest channel and is still stagnant in the smallest channel however since the outlet pressure is increased the pressure difference is no longer adequate to drive the water phase to displace the oil phase in the middle channel 5 two phase displacement in different types of porous media in this section a water phase displacing an oil phase is simulated in three types of porous media i e a pure porous medium a porous medium with isolated vugs and a porous medium with connected vugs fracture to investigate the effects of vug connectivity on multiphase flows note that the irreducible water and residual oil saturations are immobile and don t contribute mass transfer in the macroscopic view in the following simulations we compute the floodable parts of fluids in lbm and the total saturations can be achieved by including floodable saturations the irreducible and residual saturations 5 1 multiphase flow in a porous channel in this case we simulate two phase flow displacement the water phase displacing the oil phase in a two dimensional porous channel the channel width and length are 50 lu and 150 lu with the mesh size of 10 µm respectively the porous media is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic and the porosity is uniformly 0 3 in this porous channel initially the oil phase saturation is 0 8 with a residual oil saturation sor 0 2 and the irreducible water saturation swi 0 2 the oil density is ρ o 800kg m3 in the porous domain and the pressure bc is applied at the inlet i e ρ w in m3 the combined pressure and convective outflow bc was applied on the outlet layer i e pout 0 8 pin the top and bottom of the channel are set with the non slip bc half way bounce back the relaxation times for both the oil and water phases are 1 0 in this test the inter component interaction strength is gc 2 5 repulsive force and the fluid rock interaction strengths are g o a d s g w a d s 0 fig 4 shows the progress of the water phase displacing the oil phase at different times 0 04s 0 36s and 0 61s the displacement is piston like and the water front is nearly flat with a very low curvature due to the non slip boundary condition on the upper and lower boundaries fig 6 is a plot of the water oil interface position against the simulation time according to the darcy s law the average fluid speed in a homogeneous porous channel is a constant value the average velocity can be approximated by calculating the slope of the interface against the simulation time in fig 6 it shows that the slope of the interface position or the darcy velocity is approximately 10 3m s and the breakthrough time is approximately 0 65 s 5 2 multiphase flow in isolated vuggy porous media large void spaces such as multi scale vugs are frequently observed in carbonate karst formations as a result of mineral dissolution the presence of large sized vugs in porous media might alter the multiphase transport behavior because fluids behave differently in vugs than in matrix pores the fluid flow is dominated by the drag forces in the porous matrix but it is dominated by the viscous force and the inter component force in vugs due to porosity variations in different flow regions the proposed grayscale multiphase lb model switches the dominating forces and no effort is needed to determine the complex boundary conditions between two types of porosity systems in this simulation case we placed three square vugs 300 µm 300 µm in the same porous channel described in section 5 1 the porosities for the porous media and vugs are 0 3 and 1 0 respectively the initial condition boundary conditions and simulation parameters are the same as those presented in section 5 1 fig 7 shows the oil density distribution at different times 0 0233s 0 150s and 0 261 s in the displacement the water phase tends to displace the oil phase in the vugs prior to the oil phase in the matrix so the water oil interface front travels more quickly in the vugs than in the porous matrix because there are no drag forces in the rock matrix in the vugs fig 8 shows the water oil interface position vs the simulation time this plot is slightly curvier than the plot shown in fig 6 indicating that the interface movement alternatively shifts between higher and lower speeds the interface front travels at a faster speed when it encounters a vug and it slows down when it passes the entire vug the average speed of the interface front is approximately 5 7 10 3m s and the breakthrough time is 0 26 s fig 7 c shows the oil density profile after breakthrough as seen the outlet boundary condition works well for the interface smoothly propagating out the exit 5 3 multiphase flow in connected vuggy fractured porous media the next case we consider is multiphase flow in connected vuggy porous media connected vugs form high flow channels that can also be viewed as dissolution enlarged fractures we have previously investigated the impact of fractures on single phase flows in naturally fractured shale digital rocks and we found that the permeability was increased by order of magnitudes due to the fractures ning et al 2016 however the impact of connected vugs or fracture on multiphase flow is still a challenging problem zhang et al 2005 reported that a significant fraction of porosity for vuggy carbonates was contributed by connected vugs and the transport properties were significantly different in connected vuggy carbonates in this case we simulated the water phase displacing the oil phase in the porous media penetrated by connected vugs with the width of 170 µm the porosities for the matrix and the vugs are 0 3 and 1 0 respectively all simulation conditions and parameters are the same with those in the previous two cases fig 9 shows the oil phase density at different moments 1 67 10 4 s 2 5 10 3 s and 6 67 10 3 s the interface travels much faster in the connected vugs than that in the matrix in addition we have observed the diffusive two phase interface near the boundary of the fracture this diffusive behavior keeps the simulation stable for systems with a large contrast of resistance forces in the fig 10 we plotted the position of the oil water interface front against the simulation time the front travels quickly at the early period due to the sudden imposition of the pressure bc and the slight fluid compressibility and behaves linearly with time when the steady state is reached the average velocity of the interface front is approximately s and the breakthrough occurs at 6 67 10 3 s table 1 shows a comparison of the interface front speed and the breakthrough time among the above three cases the speed of the interface front in the isolated vuggy case is more than two times than that in the non vuggy case and the breakthrough time is 60 less the comparison between the isolated vuggy case and the connected vuggy case shows that the speed of interface front moves more than 38 times faster in the connected vuggy porous media and the breakthrough is much shorter which is attributed to the vug connectivity 6 two phase displacement in real vuggy carbonate core samples we now consider multiphase flow in real vuggy carbonate cores two carbonate core samples were imaged using low resolution µ ct and high resolution µ ct respectively fig 11 a shows the image of a carbonate core plug 2 5 cm in diameter using low resolution µ ct with the imaging resolution of 31 5 µm vugs with various sizes ranging from hundertmal micrometers to millimeters are shown in black due to the low attenuation coefficient the rock matrix with micro porosity is shown in dark gray and the bright material is possibly pyrite or feldspar with very low porosity fig 11 b shows the image of a carbonate mini core 3 7 mm in diameter using high resolution µ ct with the imaging resolution of 4 µm micro vugs are shown in black the dolomite mineral is shown in dark gray and the rest of the minerals with high attenuation coefficients are shown in light gray in the two carbonate cores the vug sizes range from a few microns to one millimeter the multi scale vuggy feature in carbonate is distinct from other sedimentary rocks including sandstone and shale fig 12 a and b show the segmented images of the subsets from the same carbonate sample with low µ ct resolution 31 5 µm based on the multi thresholding otsu algorithm otsu 1979 in which one threshold value is used to separate the vugs green and the homogeneous matrix brown as seen in fig 12 a and two threshold values are used to separate the vugs green the high porosity matrix light green and the low porosity matrix white as seen in fig 12 b as seen in fig 12 c the segmented image extracted from the high resolution µ ct sample shows that most of the vugs are isolated fig 12 d shows a segmented image containing vugs of various sizes in which a portion of the vugs form a channel that connects the left and the right ends in addition according to multiple gray value watersheds we segmented out four components using the multi thresholding otsu algorithm including vugs green the high porosity matrix brown the low porosity matrix white and the impermeable matrix black for the carbonate mini core in the simulations discussed below we investigated the effects of rock matrix heterogeneity vug connectivity and rock wetting preference on two phase displacement the irreducible water and residual oil saturations are assumed to be 0 2 for porous matrix in the following simulations 6 1 effect of matrix heterogeneity on the vuggy carbonate samples excluding multi scale vugs the porosity in carbonate is mainly due to the matrix pores and it presents strong heterogeneity diverse pore types and pore sizes can be found in different minerals that usually reflect different gray values in a µ ct image in this section we investigate the effect of matrix heterogeneity on two phase displacement for the vuggy carbonate samples seen in fig 12 a and b for the porosity distribution we set 1 0 for the vug spaces in both samples 0 28 for the homogeneous matrix and 0 375 and 0 05 for the heterogeneous matrix respectively the total porosity for both cases is maintained as 0 32 the mesh size is 300 lu 700 lu 22 05 mm 9 45 mm for both cases the initial density of the oil phase is ρ o 800 kg m3 the non slip half way bounce back boundary condition is applied for the upper and the lower boundaries the pressure boundary condition is applied for the inlet i e ρ w in 1000 kg m3 and the combined pressure and convective boundary condition is applied for the outlet i e pout 0 8 pin the oil water viscosity ratio is 2 i e ν o 2 ν w 2 10 6m2 s the fluid fluid interaction strength is gc 2 5 and the fluid rock interaction strength is g o a d s g w a d s 0 indicating that the vuggy carbonates are neutral wet to two immiscible phases figs 13 and 14 show the time series snapshots of the two phase distributions at different water saturations for the homogeneous and heterogeneous cases respectively the homogeneous case presents a piston like displacement although the water phase is preferably displacing the oil phase in the vug spaces which is mainly attributed to matrix homogeneity and vuggy isolation while displacement fingering is obvious in the heterogeneous case it will become less noticeable if the porosity contrast in the matrix is reduced fig 15 shows a comparison of the water phase mass fractional flow curves between the homogeneous and the heterogeneous cases fw ft is the ratio of the water phase mass flow rate over the total flow rate at the outlet of the two vuggy carbonate samples in the homogeneous case a significant jump of fw ft occurs at sw 0 75 whereas in the heterogeneous case fw ft starts increasing largely at sw 0 55 6 2 effect of vug connectivity on the vuggy carbonate samples previous studies have reported that carbonate rocks with isolated vugs showed a homogeneous behavior compared with carbonate rocks with connected vugs egermann et al 2007 vik et al 2012 connectivity in vuggy carbonates significantly alters the multiphase flow mechanism because connected vugs form high flow channels where fluids prefer to flow zhang et al 2005 now we consider two phase fluids flowing through carbonate rocks with isolated and connected vugs i e fig 12 c and d the porosity distribution can be found in fig 12 for both samples with the same total porosity of 0 34 the mesh size is 650 lu 300 lu 2 6 mm 1 2 mm for both cases ν o ν w 2 gc 2 5 and g o a d s g w a d s 0 are set in simulations same initial and boundary conditions with those presented in section 6 1 are applied figs 16 and 17 show the two phase displacement progress at different water saturations for the isolated vuggy case and the connected vuggy case respectively the interface front travels much faster in the connected vuggy case than in the isolated vuggy case because the two phase fluids encounter much less resistivity in the high flow channel fig 18 shows a comparison of the outlet water phase mass fractional flow curves between the isolated vuggy case and the connected vuggy case it can be found that fw ft has a quick jump at sw 0 31 for the connected case which indicates the water phase front reaches the outlet of the sample by contrast fw ft starts increasing significantly at sw 0 49 for the isolated vuggy case indicating the water phase breaking through this sample 6 3 effect of rock wettability on the vuggy carbonate samples in the above cases we neglected the effect of capillarity but we focused on the effect of geometric heterogeneity due to the vugs in this test we included the rock wetting preferences to investigate the effect of rock wettability on the two phase displacement we considered the heterogeneous rock sample shown in fig 12 b for this investigation with two wetting cases water wet and oil wet in the water wet case g w a d s 0 05 and g o a d s 0 05 are for the water phase and the oil phase respectively g w a d s 0 05 and g o a d s 0 05 are set in the oil wet case the initial conditions the boundary conditions the rock properties and other simulation parameters are the same as those used in the simulations shown in fig 14 fig 19 a and c show the snapshots of the water oil distribution at the same water saturation sw 0 434 for the two wetting cases fig 19 b and d show the snapshots of the water oil distribution at the same simulation time 9 5 s for the two wetting cases the differences in the two cases shown in fig 19 are summarized as follows first it takes 6 s for the oil wet case to reach the water saturation of 0 434 whereas it only takes 4 s for the water wet case to reach the same water saturation using the same simulation time 9 5 s the water saturation is 0 566 for the oil wet case and 0 656 for the water wet case these observations indicate that the water displacement is more efficient if the vuggy carbonate is water wet second the water phase tends to displace the oil phase in vugs for the oil wet case because it undergoes less resistance in the vugs however the opposite is true for the water wet case because the attractive force in the rock matrix drives the water phase to displace the oil phase in the matrix this indicates that the regions being displaced are significantly dependent on the rock wetting preferences in addition the displacement fingering is more obvious in the oil wet case than the water wet case fig 20 shows a comparison of the water mass fractional flow at the outlet between the oil wet and water wet cases the oil wet fractional flow is higher than the water wet fractional flow for most of the water saturations a significant increase in fw ftotal can be observed at sw 0 52 for the oil wet case and sw 0 61 for the water wet case residual oil distribution is perhaps one of the most concerning aspects of water flooding processes we now consider three rock wetting preferences by adjusting the fluid solid interaction forces include water wet g w ads g o a d s 0 05 weak oil wet g o ads g w a d s 0 05 and strong oil wet g o ads g w a d s 0 2 fig 21 shows the residual oil distributions at sw 0 68 for these three cases the computational times for 68 displacement efficiency are 10 5 s 17 2 s and 91 8 s for the water wet weak oil wet and strong oil wet cases respectively the residual oil distribution is significantly different among the three cases especially between the water wet case and the strong oil wet case for the most part the oil that is not displaced remains in the rock matrix for the two oil wet cases in the water wet case it remains in both the rock matrix and the vugs 7 conclusions this study developed a unified grayscale multiphase lb model for multiphase fluid flows in vuggy carbonates the formulation of this model is based on combining the generalized lb model in porous media with the pseudo potential multiphase lb model in the proposed model we considered both the linear and the nonlinear drag effects due to the porous matrix so it has the potential to simulate multiphase fluid flow in porous media with a variety of porosity systems the total force acting on the fluids contains the drag forces due to the porous matrix the fluid fluid interaction force and the fluid solid interaction force the proposed model automatically switches the flow regimes in different flow regions porosity systems without incorporating complex boundary conditions in vuggy carbonates consisting of both a porous matrix and significantly larger vugs the unified grayscale multiphase lb model is reduced to the standard pseudo potential multiphase lb model in vugs when the vug porosity is 1 0 and it recovers to the multiphase darcy model or the multiphase forcheimer non darcy model based on the matrix porosity in the porous matrix note that though the current model can recover different macroscopic equations for different flow regimes it still remains some limitations discussed in section 3 in addition we presented a combined pressure and convective outflow boundary condition for pressure driven multiphase flows in order to predict the unknown physics from the simulation domain in the numerical experiments we first validated the grayscale lbm results with the analytical single phase solutions of the darcy brinkman equation then we validated the multiphase flow results with the analytical buckley leverett solutions in a nearly piston like displacement we also calibrated the inter component strength in relation to the interfacial tension for a static oil droplet surrounded by the water phase and investigated the capillarity effects of water displacing oil in tubes of different sizes next we simulated two phase flows for three types of porous media i e non vuggy porous media purely porous matrix isolated vuggy porous media and connected vuggy fractured porous media and then we analyzed the speed of the interface front and the breakthrough time the interface front travels almost linearly as simulation time for the non vuggy porous media and the connected vuggy porous media nonlinearity was found for the isolated vuggy porous media in addition we found that the average speed of the interface front in the isolated vuggy case is more than two times faster than the speed in the non vuggy case and the breakthrough time is 60 less the comparison of the isolated vuggy and the connected vuggy cases showed that the speed of the interface front is 38 times faster in the connected vuggy porous media for the next case two real vuggy carbonate samples were imaged using low resolution µ ct and high resolution µ ct for simulating the water phase displacing the oil phase we considered four vuggy samples to investigate the effects of rock matrix heterogeneity vug connectivity and rock matrix wetting preferences two phase displacement through the four samples was carried out we found that a piston like displacement occurred in the homogeneous case whereas obvious fingering effects were observed in the heterogeneous case the water phase mass fractional flow fw ft at the outlet showed that a significant jump in fw ft occurred at sw 0 75 in the homogeneous case in the heterogeneous case fw ft increased significantly at sw 0 55 a comparison of the isolated and connected cases showed that the interface front travels much faster in the connected vuggy carbonate because the connected high flow channel did not introduce any rock drag forces to both fluid phases fw ft had a quick jump at sw 0 31 for the connected vuggy case this indicates that the water phase reached the sample outlet in the isolated case fw ft started increasing significantly sw 0 49 moreover we investigated the effect of rock matrix wetting preference on the multiphase flow behavior in the heterogeneous vuggy carbonate sample it was found that the displacement times were 50 longer in order to reach sw 0 434 for the oil wet case than the water wet case for the same moment of water displacement i e 9 5 s the water saturation was 0 566 for the oil wet case and 0 656 for the water wet case indicating the water displacement is more efficient if the vuggy carbonate is water wet the mass fractional flow was found to be higher in the oil wet case for most of the water saturations a significant increase in fw ftotal was observed at sw 0 52 for the oil wet case and sw 0 61 for the water wet case finally we investigated the residual oil distribution for different types of rock wettability at the same displacement efficiency 68 the computational times were 10 5 s 17 2 s and 91 8 s for the water wet weak oil wet and strong oil wet cases respectively the oil that was not displaced remained mainly in the rock matrix for the oil wet cases and it remained in both the rock matrix and the vugs for the water wet case in the future we will work on the incorporation of realistic pore scale relative permeability with the inclusion of rock wettability beyond the scope of piston like displacement process in porous matrix elements and then recover the relative permeability and capillary pressure curves for whole core scale three dimensional 3d vuggy carbonates acknowledgments this research is supported in partial by us national science foundation through

application 1 appendix a boundary condition treatments for multiphase lbm fig a illustrates three boundary types including the solid boundary the inlet boundary and the outlet boundary a 1 bounce back boundary condition the bounce back bc is a widely used model in lbm for treating stationary solid boundaries ensuring a non slip velocity on solid boundaries the bounce back scheme assumes that particles stream to a solid node and then bounce back to the node it came from among bounce back schemes the half way bounce back has second order accuracy as well as easy implementation the half way bounce back bc for the fluid nodes at the ny 1 layer can be expressed as a1 f σ 4 7 8 x n y 1 t δ t f σ 2 5 6 x n y 1 t where f tilde is the post collision distribution function the unknown f σ 4 7 8 after the streaming step are obtained through the bounce back rule a 2 periodic boundary condition the periodic bc is useful when the flow domain can be assumed to be infinitely long the periodic bc means that particles flowing out of the computational domain on one side of the boundary will flow into the domain on the other side at next time step taking the inlet and the outlet boundaries in x direction as an example we have a2 f σ 1 5 8 0 y t δ t f σ 1 5 8 n x y t f σ 3 6 7 n x y t δ t f σ 3 6 7 0 y t where nx is the outlet boundary node in x direction for many multiphase lbm simulations in porous media the inlet and outlet bcs are set to periodic and fluids are driven to flow by an external force a 3 pressure boundary condition in two phase immiscible displacement processes the periodic bc is not always proper as the displacement domain is finite the pressure bc is common for immiscible displacement both experimentally and numerically for example given the pressure or the fluid density on the inlet layer x 0 f σ 1 f σ 5 f σ 8 and ux σ are unknowns assuming u y σ 0 after the streaming step zou and he 1997 proposed the bounce back rule for the non equilibrium parts of the distribution function normal to the flow boundary as a3 f σ 1 0 y t f σ 1 e q 0 y t f σ 3 0 y t f σ 3 e q 0 y t the unknown distribution functions f σ 1 f σ 5 f σ 8 and u x σ can be solved using eqs 2 5 and 6 and a3 similarly the velocity bc can also be implemented using the non equilibrium bounce back scheme a 4 outflow boundary condition for immiscible displacement processes the inflow bcs are usually given in terms of pressure or flow rate and the type of injecting fluid is also known however the outflow bc is not straightforward in lbm for multiphase flows since the physics outside the computational domain is not known lou et al 2013 presented a convective bc for velocity driven two phase flows here we adopt the convective bc and present an outflow bc for pressure driven immiscible flows let s consider the following scenario for demonstration the entire core sample is initially saturated with the oil phase then the water phase is injected from the inlet with pressure p i n c s 2 ρ w as ρ o 0 and the outlet pressure is fixed at pout pin according to eq 8 though pout can be given for computation the densities of oil and water phases at the outlet layer are still not known we apply the convective bc on water as its density at the outlet layer is very small compared with the oil density before water breakthrough a4 f w α t u w f w α x 0 x n x where uw is the water phase velocity normal to the outlet lou et al 2013 evaluated three choices of uw including local average and maximum velocities at the nx 1 layer and observed good outputs for all three choices eq a4 can be discretized using first order finite difference and be written in an implicit form as a5 f w α n x y t δ t f w α n x y t λ f w α n x 1 y t δ t 1 λ where λ u w n x 1 t δ t δ t δ x in this work we choose the average water density of the nx 1 layer at t δ t after the streaming step i e u w n x 1 t δ t 1 n y 1 y u x w n x 1 y t δ t all quantities on the right hand side of eq a5 are known after the streaming step consequently the water phase density ρ w nx can be calculated with the solved water phase distribution functions and the oil phase density is then calculated by eq 8 as ρ o n x p o u t c s 2 ρ w n x g c ρ w n x applying the non equilibrium bounce back scheme discussed in section a 3 we can solve all unknown distribution functions for the oil phase at the nx layer this combined

703,series of numerical simulations were done to quantify the effects of pore structure approximations on micro scale displacement mechanisms coupled cahn hilliard phase field and navier stokes equations were solved using finite element method to simulate two phase flow in a heterogeneous model having a real pore network as the base case compared to two other approximated models in one of those the complex grain geometries were simplified to circular shapes while in the other one only the sizes of the real shaped grains were gently less than 10 modified in both approximated models the medium porosity and absolute permeability were kept unchanged compared to the base case the simplification of the grain shapes changed the morphologies of the formed fingers and the trapped oil volumes the general trends of the oil recovery factor and macro scale capillary pressure variations were similar during displacement at different medium wettabilities for the base and the simplified models however the simplified model showed higher displacement efficiency at water wet conditions and lower capillary pressures at oil wet conditions due to less complexity of its pore network geometry different micro scale events were captured similarly in both models including reverse displacement interface coalescence water bursting and stick slip motion but the oil trapping mechanisms were totally different slight modification of the grain sizes resulted in different displacement profiles especially at neutral and oil wetting conditions and low capillary numbers log ca 3 69 due to modification of capillarity in the medium hence variation of the preferred paths of the displacing phase finger s keywords phase field method wettability capillary number grain size grain shape

scale medium geometrical characteristics such as the pore sizes and the grain shapes chai et al 2016 hearn et al 1994 rokhforouz et al 2016 weger et al 2009 zamel et al 2010 therefore during the last two decades the study of these effects has been the subject of numerous pore scale experimental and numerical works lacey et al 2017 osei bonsu et al 2018 rangel german and kovscek 2002 stahl and konietzky 2011 tahmasebi et al 2017 xu and prodanović 2018 many of them discussed the pore structure impact on the porosity and absolute permeability of porous media rangel german and kovscek 2002 weger et al 2009 ioannidis and chatzis 1993 used regular cubic lattices with different pore size distributions to discuss the effect of the shape of the network elements on prediction of the model properties li et al 2017 used the scanning electron microscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis on sandstone rocks and observed that the grain size differences highly affected the microstructure distribution and porosity variation in porous network increasing the grains sizes resulted in higher porosities hence permeabilities some of those reported studies address the effects of pore geometries on single and multi phase transport properties man and jing 1999 studied the pore geometry influence on capillary pressure garcia et al 2009 observed that only the type of pores with an angular cross section could form intermediate wetting phase layers which is important in multiphase flow rad et al 2015 used x ray micro tomography to assess the effect of the particle and the pore sizes on salt precipitation dynamics during evaporation from a sand column with increasing the grain size in the porous medium thicker salt crusts were formed ahfir et al 2017 investigated the effects of the grain size distribution on transport of suspended particles through porous media at different flow velocities larger grain size distributions enhanced deposition of the suspended particles also the structured heterogeneity of porous media strongly affected the solid particle filtration recently xu and prodanović 2018 evaluated the effect of pore geometry on n2 adsorption and desorption isotherms using pore network modeling three types of pore shapes including spherical cylindrical and slip were considered and it was observed that a network of spherical pores always predicts a larger pore sizes higher surface energy better connectivity yet smaller surface area than cylindrical pores while slit pores showed the opposite behavior there are also few works which especially studied these effects in the field of eor at pore scale lacey et al 2017 conducted a series of microfluidic experiments to assess the impact of pore and grain size on the oil recovery efficiency during water and polymer injections the effect of pore size on oil entrapment was not uniform for different viscosity ratios and polymer flooding was more effective in media with coarser grain sizes in another study conducted by osei bonsu et al 2018 the effects of pore geometry on foam flow in porous media was investigated increasing pore throat sizes of the domain decreased the medium capillary pressure in addition they showed that the round grains in the medium results in higher capillary pressure gradient compared to the angular ones guo et al 2018 assessed the impact of pore structure on the morphology of residual oil clusters and the oil displacement efficiency in the real sandstone samples the samples with lower permeabilities showed smaller displacement efficiencies during the invasion process also larger pore throat ratio and tortuosity resulted in lower displacement efficiency while larger coordination number improved the displacement efficiency this influence of geometrical characteristics of porous media on fluid transports becomes critical when a real medium is replaced with a pore scale model in order to be experimentally or numerically simulated due to the lack of experimental resolution in pore space characterization and also the limitations of applied simulation methods these kinds of duplications normally contain unavoidable approximations in the sizes and the shapes of the medium pore networks blunt et al 2013 so the results of such studies encounter irrevocable inaccuracies for example pore network modeling which has been the most popular method during the last three decades blunt 2001 sahimi 1993 needs simplification of the medium geometry in this method and other similar approaches the porous networks with complex topologies are simplified to networks of the well defined geometrical shapes shams et al 2018a b enref 17 this could make the predictions of transport properties less credible blunt et al 2013 xiong et al 2016 despite the wide applications of these simplifications in literature one can rarely find any study which addresses the type and the degree of errors resulted by such approximations in this work series of numerical simulations of two phase transports in porous media were conducted to quantify the effects of the medium geometrical approximations in terms of the grains shapes and sizes the cahn hilliard phase field method cahn and hilliard 1958 was applied in this study for two phase flow simulations the interface capturing methods e g phase field method are recently becoming popular due to their ability to handle complex pore geometries and topological changes without using model approximations yue et al 2004 akhlaghi amiri and hamouda 2013 compared level set and phase field methods and found that phase field method realistically captured phenomena related to viscous and capillary forces with a reasonable computational time it is a physically originated method which not only addresses the interface in the flow but also ensures that the total energy of the system is minimized yue et al 2004 akhlaghi amiri and hamouda 2013 phase field method has been proven in different reported studies to capture physical phenomena in fluid displacements through complex pore geometries akhlaghi amiri and hamouda 2013 2014 basirat et al 2017 maaref et al 2017 rokhforouz and akhlaghi amiri 2017a b the simulation results were compared in a micro model having a real heterogeneous pattern base case with two other models the first one is similarly patterned with simplified circular grain shapes the second one has exactly the same pattern as the base case but with slightly different grain sizes the displacement profiles recovery factors pore scale mechanisms and capillary pressures were compared in these models under different medium wettabilities and capillary numbers 2 numerical model this section presents the computational geometry governing equations and the numerical scheme used in this study 2 1 model geometry and boundary conditions a realistic porous domain which has been already used by keller et al 1997 was employed as the computational domain geometrical properties of the simulated domain are presented in table 1 the medium was initially saturated with the oil phase which was displaced by the water phase being injected with a constant velocity uinj from the right hand side of the medium as shown in fig 1 the pressure was assumed to be zero at the outlets on the left hand side of the medium symmetry boundary conditions were employed on the lateral sides the boundary condition of the grain surfaces was considered as wetted walls with a specified contact angle it was supposed that the fluids are incompressible with constant physical properties and without phase change gravity was neglected assuming 2d horizontal flow to assess the impact of the grain size and the shape on the displacement behavior the two other simulated model geometries were constructed presented in fig 2 fig 2a shows the simplified model with circular grains in which the real shaped grains were replaced with the circles at the same locations this model is called then the simplified model however the porosity and permeability of the medium remained unchanged see table 1 besides to ensure the similarity of the models in terms of the pores number and connectivity the numbers of the grains and the throats were kept quite similar in both models 51 grains and 91 throats in the base model and 49 grains and 87 throats in the simplified one fig 2b depicts the other simulated model with the approximated grain sizes gray one in which randomly selected real shaped grains were resized by 10 compared with the base case red one this model is called here the modified model in the modified model some of the randomly selected grains were enlarged and the others became smaller in order to keep the medium porosity permeability and average geometrical properties identical with the base case medium table 1 2 2 governing equations and numerical scheme the injected fluid velocity uinj in the simulated porous media was in the range of 5 10 4 5 10 2 m s

element solver comsol multiphysics 2011 the domain was resolved by triangular elements finer meshes were implemented around the sharp corners and inside the thin throats and the small pores fig 3 and the coarser ones in the larger pore bodies considering the average pore diameter in porous medium as the characteristic length lc and defining cahn number as cn ε lc it was demonstrated by akhlaghi amiri and hamouda 2013 that using cn 0 03 and mesh element size of h 0 8ε the model convergence and mesh convergence are satisfied for the phase field method by implementing these values in the simulations of this work the average number of mesh elements used in the simulated models was 96 646 with the average size of 1 95 µm the other critical parameter in the phase field formulation is the mobility γ which according to yue et al 2006 has to be large enough to retain a more or less constant interfacial thickness and small enough to keep the convective motion sensitivity studies done by akhlaghi amiri and hamouda 2013 showed that simulations with 0 1 γ 1 results in less volume shrinkage of fluids in the simulation of two phase flow problems so γ 1 was used in the current study the computational time required for the simulations varied between 3 and 14 days on a 64 bit computer system intel core i7 7700 k 4 20 ghz processor and 16 gb installed memory depending on the model geometry capillary number and contact angle the time steps sizes were controlled by the numerical solver during the computations using backward differentiation formulas bdf particularly the initial time step sizes were small enough to avoid singularity the constructed model s numerical parameters and its convergence and errors including parasite and shrinkage were carefully analyzed by akhlaghi amiri and hamouda 2013 the rectangular bubble relaxation stratified two phase flow in channel and flow in single pore elements as well as in different types of porous media were thoroughly studied the numerical parameters e g initialization time and diffusion coefficient were tuned to damp the parasite currents and minimize the shrinkage effect during the simulation time the constructed phase field simulation method was more evaluated in non isothermal two phase flow problems at different viscous capillary flow regimes and wettabilities by akhlaghi amiri and hamouda 2014 in complicated porous media and showed good agreement with the experimental observations it was later verified in simulation of more complex two phase flow problems in heterogenous media rokhforouz and akhlaghi amiri 2017a 2018 3 results and discussion the effects of the grain s shape and size approximations on transport behaviors under different capillary number and wettability conditions are addressed here using several sensitivity studies 3 1 effect of the grain shape simplification in the first section two phase displacement behavior in the base case fig 1 is compared with the simplified model containing circular grains fig 2a capillary number is defined as c a μ w u i n j σ and viscosity ratio is m μ w μ o where μ is the viscosity σis the interfacial tension u inj is the injection velocity besides w and o denote water and oil respectively the influence of wettability is addressed here for displacements with log ca 3 69 and log m 0 to quantify the degree of wettability contact angle θ is studied which is a boundary condition in determining the interfacial shape brown and neustadter 1980 rabbani et al 2017 the grain surface is considered water wet if θ π 2 and oil wet if θ π 2 fig 4 shows the fluid distributions at two instances for the base model the two left columns and the simplified one the two right columns respectively at different θ values of π 6 π 3 π 2 2π 3 and 5π 6 the first instance is just after 0 4 pore volume injection pvi of water and the other is after displacement stabilization the blue and the red colors represent water and oil phases respectively and the color gradient represents the interface mixing zone as the medium is water wet θ π 2 water injection represents an imbibition process while when the medium is oil wet θ π 2 it represents a drainage process as shown in fig 4 in both models as the contact angle increases the medium becomes more oil wet the displacement deviates from stable piston like pattern and becomes unstable containing fingerings which is in agreement with the reported experimental and numerical works akhlaghi amiri and hamouda 2014 anderson 1987b basirat et al 2017 celauro et al 2014 maaref et al 2017 martys et al 1991 morrow 1990 rabbani et al 2017 rokhforouz and akhlaghi amiri 2018 these instabilities are called capillary fingerings which occurs at low capillary numbers e g low injection rates or as non wetting phase displaces wetting phase lenormand et al 1988 akhlaghi amiri and hamouda 2014 they are normally appeared in the form of wide forward and lateral moving fronts lenormand et al 1988 however the simplified model could not accurately predict the details of the displacement including the morphology of the formed fingers and the trapped oil volumes in the medium as compared with the base model at θ π 6 the simplified model is almost swept by water while the base case contains numerous trapped oil volumes in the domain especially in the dead end pores this observation is also evident in other wettability states as the models become less water wet the swept area decreases corresponding to the previous reports jamaloei et al 2011 meybodi et al 2011 tweheyo et al 1999 comparison of fig 4 at θ π 6 and θ π 3 shows that in both models especially at the top of the media the bypassed oil drops become larger as θ increases from π 6 to π 3 as the medium becomes less water wet the capillary imbibition becomes weaker hence the injected water prefers to sweep larger pores and throats so it bypasses the smaller ones as depicted in fig at θ π 2 neutral wetting condition for the simplified model water is propagated through a regularly shaped water finger with the thickness in the order of two three pore sizes similarly at the same wettability for the base model there is a thick water finger however with less regularity in its shape and thickness compared to the model with circular grains for the oil wet media fig 4 at θ 2π 3 and 5π 6 the instability and complexity of the water profile increases especially in the base model with real grain shapes in the simplified model as the medium becomes more oil wet the number of active fingers increases while their thickness decreases this is less pronounced for the base case fig 5 compares the oil recovery factor rf as a function of water pvi for the base case fig 5a and the simplified model fig 5b at different grain s contact angles in general decreasing θ results in higher rf and a later breakthrough time in both models which is in agreement with the reported studies brown and neustadter 1980 celauro et al 2014 grattoni et al 1997 martys et al 1991 morrow 1990 owens and archer 1971 as discussed above fig 4 when the medium becomes less water wet the displacement profile changes from stable to unstable with fingerings hence rf decreases and water breakthrough is accelerated however it is observed in both models that the displacement has a lower ultimate rf and earlier water breakthrough time at θ π 2 neutral wetting condition compared to the one with θ 2π 3 slightly oil wet condition this is due to the progress of an additional finger through relatively large pores throats in the models with θ 2π 3 see fig 4 at θ π 3 compared to the ones with θ π 2 fig 4 at θ π 2 the medium with θ 5π 6 has the lowest rf around 0 4 in both models due to the high instability of the front and its relatively thin fingers unlike other wettabilities it is observed that at θ 5π 6 rf decreases after breakthrough time before stabilization this phenomenon happens due to thinning of some of the formed water fingerings which was also observed during non wetting phase injection in micromodel experimental maaref et al 2017 and numerical akhlaghi amiri and hamouda 2014 works in porous media with micro size dimensions i e with extremely low pore volume this fingerings deformation has a short term effect on rf as similarly captured in the work of basirat et al 2017 then rf is stabilized this kink in rf is more pronounced for the simplified model although ultimate rfs are almost similar in both models at oil wetting conditions the simplified model shows considerably higher rfs at water wet conditions for example in the base model with θ π 6 fig 5a ultimate oil rf is about 0 85 while it is 0 98 20 higher in the simplified model at the same wettability fig 5b this is due to the larger trapped oil volumes in the base model at water wet conditions compared to the simplified one as discussed earlier fig 4 at θ π 6 the macro scale capillary pressure in porous media depends on the contact angle wettability pore structure initial saturation and saturation history anderson 1987a it can be defined as the difference between the intrinsic phase average of the non wetting and wetting pressures ferrari and lunati 2013 whitaker 1977 10 δ p a v g p n w p w 11 p n w v p v f 2 d v v v f 2 d v p w v p v f 1 d v v v f 1 d v where pw and pnw denote wetting and non wetting fluids pressure respectively in addition vf1 and vf2 are the volume fraction of the wetting and non wetting fluids which are defined as v f 1 1 ϕ 2 v f 1 1 ϕ 2 fig 6 depicts the macro scale capillary pressure δpavg as a function of the water saturation sw for the base and the simplified models at different grain s contact angles it can be seen that in general the average of variations in δpavg increases as θ increases this indicates higher capillary pressure resistance in the case of less water wet media resulting in lower sweep efficiency as demonstrated in fig 5 fig 6 also shows unsteady fluctuations of macro scale capillary pressure with increasing water saturation these fluctuations which are known as haines jumps occur when the non wetting fluid passes from pore neck into a wider pore body during the drainage process armstrong et al 2015 berg et al 2013 once the invading fluid s pressure overcomes the capillary entry pressure of a pore throat the nearby pore body is filled swiftly at small θ values water wet conditions negative capillary pressures indicate the imbibition process water wet media has lower pressure fluctuations the main difference between the two diagrams is the range of pressure variations which is higher for the base model as shown in fig 6a the pressure varies between 1 and 6 kpa in the base case while it is between 1 and 4 kpa in the simplified one this difference is more pronounced in oil wet media the complexity of the shape of pores and throats in the base model is the main reason for this observation where the meandrous paths in this model result in higher pressure required to displace the fluids compared to the simplified one different pore scale mechanisms are observed in both models at various wetting conditions which highly affect the efficiency of the displacement figs 7 11 demonstrate some pore scale events which similarly happen in the base and simplified models these figures illustrate the events for enlarged sections of the models at four instants two instants in figure i and two instants in figure ii where the white contour in i represents the earlier instance while the black contour in ii shows the last one the dimensionless capillary pressure p c d is plotted as a function of the dimensionless time td for each of the four instances which is also compared in figs 7 11 for both models the dimensionless capillary pressure and time are defined as p c d p p c and td t u inj lc where pc is the capillary pressure p c σ cos θ l c and u inj is the injection velocity as depicted in instance i of fig 7a and b at water wet condition at θ π 6 water attaches the grain then water oil contact line movement takes place on the grain surface during the water imbibition process similarly in both models the oil phase film on the grain surface consequently narrows until the water phase surrounds the whole grain instance ii in fig 7a and b the trend and the range of variations in capillary pressure are also similar in both models capillary pressure first increases until the grain is contacted by water and shows an extremum at this moment then during contact line movement on the grain pc decreases since the two fluids do not mix a pressure difference does not dissipate this pressure difference may lead to water front progress in other zones fig 8 shows a pore level reverse displacement mechanism around a marked grain happened similarly in both models at θ π 6 in this mechanism the interface moves slightly in reverse direction and the interface s curvature is changed from almost convex instance i in fig 8a and b to concave instance ii in fig 8a and b this causes the interface to be forced back into the pore throat against the direction of the main stream flow due to this convex interface profile as shown in fig 8a and b the capillary pressure is negative at the initial moment in both models then it is increased during the reverse displacement process as the interface direction changes however the range of pressure variations is different this pressure gradient rise can be seen during water injection in that zone which causes water front progress in other zones fig 9 illustrates the interface coalescence mechanism which occurs in the same way for both media at θ π 6 two water oil interfaces from two sides meet each other on a grain surface instance i in fig 9a and b at a later time instance ii in fig 9a and b an interface coalescence mechanism happens in which the two interfaces join and form a single one then the new formed interface progresses in the medium in both models the capillary pressure has initially a negative sign due to the convex shape of the two approaching interfaces at the coalescence moment the capillary pressure becomes almost zero then becomes positive however due to different geometries of the two models the values of the pressures are not similar during displacement process in strongly oil wet media θ 5π 6 water bursting mechanism in the pores is evident as also observed by holtzman and segre 2015 as shown in fig 10 in both models water fingers form a blob shape as enter the wide pores instance i in fig 10a and b water bursting continued and the blob shaped water then expand until attach to the surrounding grains instance ii in fig 10a and b fig 10 also demonstrates the water snap off configuration especially in the simplified model due to the geometry of the simplified model the thickness of water fingers experiences a wavy shape in both models p c d shows a decreasing trend as the water blobs are formed and becomes larger the values of the resultant capillary pressures depend on the size of the blobs the enlarged views of different oil trapping mechanisms are shown in fig 11 which compares this phenomenon in the two models at different wettability conditions in general the oil trapping in the simplified model happens between at least two grains while in the case of the base model numerous oil volumes are observed which are trapped even within a single grain with a dead area for example in the case of the base model fig 11a at θ π 6 water phase bridges between two adjacent grains and the interface coalesce happens as a result the receding oil phase is entrapped in the dead end pore marked with a red square in the simplified model fig 11b with corresponding wettability θ π 6 however oil which surrounds a small grain is trapped between two other grains so three grains are involved in this process in the case of the base model fig 11a with θ 2π 3 the interfaces of two progressing water fingers approach together this causes entrapment of the receding fluid between the two adjacent grains in the case of the simplified model fig 11b with θ 2π 3 two instances of oil entrapment are depicted one of them shows the formation of an oil trap between two grains while the other one between three grains another oil trapping event in the base model happens due to the expansion of a water blob fig 11a at θ 5π 6 where this expansion exhibits a stick slip motion and confines the oil in the closed area of a single grain on the other hand at the same wettability in the simplified model fig 11b at θ 5π 6 an advancing water stream approaches two other stable ones and an oil volume which cannot find a pathway to exit is then trapped between three grains specified by the red mark in fig 12 the effect of the capillary number on displacement profiles for the base case is compared with the simplified model at θ 5π 6 for both models at low capillary number log ca 4 69 the water front stopped moving almost at the middle of the medium at low ca the injection pressure could not overcome the medium capillary resistance at oil wet conditions so the fluids moved to the symmetrical boundaries on the top and the bottom of the medium as capillary increased from log ca 3 69 to 2 69 although the oil recovery factor variation was negligible less than 3 for the two models the displacement profiles were slightly changed e g the formed water fingers became almost thinner these changes in displacement profile and finger morphology were more pronounced in the case of the simplified model fig 12b compared to the base model fig 12a some of the fingers in the simplified model became stretched at log ca 2 69 which is not the case at lower ca values 3 2 effect of the grain size approximation to understand the impact of the grain size approximation on the physics of the flow through porous media the modified model fig 2b was developed in which the randomly selected grains were resized by 10 in a random way fig 13 shows the stabilized fluid distributions in the modified model at different θ values wettability effect on the displacement profiles is quite similar to what was observed in fig 4 for the base model in other words increasing θ resulted in a deviation from piston like pattern to an unstable one containing capillary finger s consequently higher trapped oil volumes and thinner water fingers can be seen as θ increased or the medium became less water wet a general comparison of fig 13 the modified model and fig 4 the base model demonstrates that a slight modification of the model geometry affected both displacement pattern and efficiency especially at θ π 2 for example at θ π 2 in the base model fig 4 at θ π 2 the left columns water progressed to the outlet via one single finger while in the modified model fig 13 at θ π 2 two fingers were developed which one of them reached the outlet in the case of θ 2π 3 and 5π 6 fragmentation of the main fingers happened earlier in the base model fig 4 at θ π 3 and 5π 6 the left columns compared to the modified model fig 13 at θ π 3 and 5π 6 this resulted in a considerable trapped oil volume in the big pore at the middle of the medium in the case of the oil wet base model fig 4 at θ π 3 and 5π 6 the left column which is not the case in the modified one instead the oil is trapped in the top and the bottom sides of the modified model fig 13 at θ π 3 and 5π 6 these observations indicate that by modification of the grain sizes i e modification of the pore throat sizes the preferred path s of the injected phase was changed in other words a different distribution of capillarity was formed in the medium by slight grain size modification which affected the fluid distribution especially at neutral and oil wetting conditions fig 14 demonstrates the oil recovery factor as a function of the water pore volume injected in the modified model at different grain s contact angles general comparison of fig 14 the modified model and fig 5a the base case show almost similar trends of rf in both models at different wettabilities however as shown in fig 14 the profiles of rf versus pvi for the two cases of θ π 2 and θ 2π 3 are almost coincident while in the case of the base model fig 5a rf was higher at θ 2π 3 compared to that of θ π 2 as depicted in fig 13 at θ π 2 there are two water fingers in the medium after stabilization while in the base model fig 4 at θ π 2 the left column water progressed via one single finger this is due to the small difference between these two studied media in distribution of the capillary paths which resulted in a higher rf of the modified model compared to the base case at θ π 2 the effects of capillary number on displacement profiles are compared for the two models at θ 5π 6 in fig 15 in the case of the displacement at the lowest ca log ca 4 69 injection pressure cannot overcome capillary resistance thus the water front stopped moving before reaching the outlet similar to what was observed in the case of the base and simplified models fig 12 however the stabilized fluid distribution in the modified model at log ca 4 69 is completely different from that of the base model the formed finger has a different morphology and it progressed deeper into the medium in the case of the modified model compared to the base case this progressed finger in the case of the modified model fig 15 log ca 4 69 could find wide pore throats in its path so progressed deeper by overcoming the medium capillary resistance while in the case of the base model fig 12a log ca 4 69 the water finger could not meet such a desirable pathway for movement by increasing ca from log ca 3 69 to 2 69 the swept area by water was considerably about 10 increased due to the formation of new small fingers in different parts of the medium fig 15 4 conclusion although the general view of the displacement pattern was almost similar for the base model and the simplified one with circular grains the displacement details were modified fingering morphology ultimate recovery capillary pressure distribution and also pore scale oil trapping mechanism were different especially at oil wet media the simplification of the medium resulted in a higher oil recovery in strongly water wet medium and a lower oil recovery in strongly oil wet media the range of macro scale capillary pressure of the simplified model was less than that of the base case at oil wetting conditions oil was trapped between at least two grains in the simplified model while dead end corners of the grains were the main area for oil trapping in the base model however other pore scale events e g grain surrounding reverse displacement interface coalescence and water bursting and the related capillary pressure variations were similarly captured in both models modification of the model with slight changing the grain sizes resulted in generally different flow profiles and trapped oil distributions especially at neutral and oil wetting conditions θ π 2 even small modification of the grain sizes changed the preferred paths of the displacing phase fingering s due to modification of the capillarity in the medium the oil recovery factor in the simplified model was increased at neutral wetting condition compared to the base model at low capillary numbers log ca 3 69 and at oil wetting conditions the difference between the modified model and the base case was exaggerated the results of this study shed light upon the importance of the model geometrical accuracy in simulation of displacements at pore scale in general it was found that the effect of the medium grain geometry on fluid flow becomes more pronounced when the medium capillarity effect becomes higher log ca 4 69 and at oil wet conditions acknowledgments this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors 
703,series of numerical simulations were done to quantify the effects of pore structure approximations on micro scale displacement mechanisms coupled cahn hilliard phase field and navier stokes equations were solved using finite element method to simulate two phase flow in a heterogeneous model having a real pore network as the base case compared to two other approximated models in one of those the complex grain geometries were simplified to circular shapes while in the other one only the sizes of the real shaped grains were gently less than 10 modified in both approximated models the medium porosity and absolute permeability were kept unchanged compared to the base case the simplification of the grain shapes changed the morphologies of the formed fingers and the trapped oil volumes the general trends of the oil recovery factor and macro scale capillary pressure variations were similar during displacement at different medium wettabilities for the base and the simplified models however the simplified model showed higher displacement efficiency at water wet conditions and lower capillary pressures at oil wet conditions due to less complexity of its pore network geometry different micro scale events were captured similarly in both models including reverse displacement interface coalescence water bursting and stick slip motion but the oil trapping mechanisms were totally different slight modification of the grain sizes resulted in different displacement profiles especially at neutral and oil wetting conditions and low capillary numbers log ca 3 69 due to

two decades the study of these effects has been the subject of numerous pore scale experimental and numerical works lacey et al 2017 osei bonsu et al 2018 rangel german and kovscek 2002 stahl and konietzky 2011 tahmasebi et al 2017 xu and prodanović 2018 many of them discussed the pore structure impact on the porosity and absolute permeability of porous media rangel german and kovscek 2002 weger et al 2009 ioannidis and chatzis 1993 used regular cubic lattices with different pore size distributions to discuss the effect of the shape of the network elements on prediction of the model properties li et al 2017 used the scanning electron microscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis on sandstone rocks and observed that the grain size differences highly affected the microstructure distribution and porosity variation in porous network increasing the grains sizes resulted in higher porosities hence permeabilities some of those reported studies address the effects

pore sizes on salt precipitation dynamics during evaporation from a sand column with increasing the grain size in the porous medium thicker salt crusts were formed ahfir et al 2017 investigated the effects of the grain size distribution on transport of suspended particles through porous media at different flow velocities larger grain size distributions enhanced deposition of the suspended particles also the structured heterogeneity of porous media strongly affected the solid particle filtration recently xu and prodanović 2018 evaluated the effect of pore geometry on n2 adsorption and desorption isotherms using pore network modeling three types of pore shapes including spherical cylindrical and slip were considered and it was observed that a network of spherical pores always predicts a larger pore sizes higher surface energy better connectivity yet smaller surface area than cylindrical pores while slit pores showed the opposite behavior there are also few works which especially studied these effects in the field of eor at pore scale lacey et al 2017 conducted a series of microfluidic experiments to assess the impact of pore and grain size on the oil recovery efficiency during water and polymer injections the effect of pore size on oil entrapment was not uniform for different viscosity ratios and polymer flooding was more effective in media with coarser grain sizes in another study conducted by osei bonsu et al 2018 the effects of pore geometry on foam flow in porous media was investigated increasing pore throat sizes of the domain decreased the medium capillary pressure in addition they showed that the round grains in the medium results in higher capillary pressure gradient compared to the angular ones guo et al 2018 assessed the impact of pore structure on the morphology of residual oil clusters and the oil displacement efficiency in the real sandstone samples the samples with lower permeabilities showed smaller displacement efficiencies during the invasion process also larger pore throat ratio and tortuosity resulted in lower displacement efficiency while larger coordination number improved the displacement efficiency this influence of geometrical characteristics of porous media on fluid transports becomes critical when a real medium is replaced with a pore scale model in order to be experimentally or numerically simulated due to the lack of experimental resolution in pore space characterization and also the limitations of applied simulation methods these kinds of duplications normally contain unavoidable approximations in the sizes and the shapes of the medium pore networks blunt et al 2013 so the results of such studies encounter irrevocable inaccuracies for example pore network modeling which has been the most popular method during the last three decades blunt 2001 sahimi 1993 needs simplification of the medium geometry in this method and other similar approaches the porous networks with complex topologies are simplified to networks of the well defined geometrical shapes shams et al 2018a b enref 17 this could make the predictions of transport properties less credible blunt et al 2013 xiong et al 2016 despite the wide applications of these simplifications in literature one can rarely find any study which addresses the type and the degree of errors resulted by such approximations in this work series of numerical simulations of two phase transports in porous media were conducted to quantify the effects of the medium geometrical approximations in terms of the grains shapes and sizes the cahn hilliard phase field method cahn and hilliard 1958 was applied in this study for two phase flow simulations the interface capturing methods e g phase field method are recently becoming

not only addresses the interface in the flow but also ensures that the total energy of the system is minimized yue et al 2004 akhlaghi amiri and hamouda 2013 phase field method has been proven in

capillary pressures were compared in these models under different medium wettabilities and capillary numbers 2 numerical model this section presents the computational geometry governing equations and the numerical scheme used in this study 2 1 model geometry and boundary conditions a realistic porous domain which has been already used by keller et al 1997 was employed as the computational domain geometrical properties of the simulated domain are presented in table 1 the medium was initially saturated with the oil phase which was displaced by the water phase being injected with a constant velocity uinj from the right hand side of the medium as shown in fig 1 the pressure was assumed to be zero at the outlets on the left hand side of the medium symmetry boundary conditions were employed on the lateral sides the boundary condition of the grain surfaces was considered as wetted walls with a specified contact angle it was supposed that the fluids are incompressible with constant physical properties and without phase change gravity was neglected assuming 2d horizontal flow to assess the impact of the grain size and the shape on the displacement behavior the two other simulated model geometries were constructed presented in fig 2 fig 2a shows the simplified model with circular grains in which the real shaped grains were replaced with the circles at the same locations this model is called then the simplified model however the porosity and permeability of the medium remained unchanged see table 1 besides to ensure the similarity of the models in terms of the pores number and connectivity the numbers of the grains and the throats were kept quite similar in both models 51 grains and 91 throats in the base model and 49 grains and 87 throats in the simplified one fig 2b depicts the other simulated model with the approximated grain sizes gray one in which randomly selected real shaped grains were resized by 10 compared with the base case red one this model is called here the modified model in the modified model some of the randomly selected grains were enlarged and the others became smaller in order to keep the medium porosity permeability and average geometrical properties identical with the base case medium table 1 2 2 governing equations and numerical scheme the injected fluid velocity uinj in the simulated porous media was in the range of 5 10 4 5 10 2 m s

the coarser ones in the larger pore bodies considering the average pore diameter in porous medium as the characteristic length lc and defining cahn number as cn ε lc it was demonstrated by akhlaghi amiri and hamouda 2013 that using cn 0 03 and mesh element size of h 0 8ε the model convergence and mesh convergence are satisfied for the phase field method by implementing these values in the simulations of this work the average number of mesh elements used in the simulated models was 96 646 with the average size of 1 95 µm the other critical parameter in the phase field formulation is the mobility γ which according to yue et al 2006 has to be large enough to retain a more or less constant interfacial thickness and small enough to keep the convective motion sensitivity studies done by akhlaghi amiri and hamouda 2013 showed that simulations with 0 1 γ 1 results in less volume shrinkage of fluids in the simulation of two phase flow problems so γ 1 was used in the current study the computational time required for the simulations varied between 3 and 14 days on a 64 bit computer system intel core i7 7700 k 4 20 ghz processor and 16 gb installed memory depending on the model geometry capillary number and contact angle the time steps sizes were controlled by the numerical solver during the computations using backward differentiation formulas bdf particularly the initial time step sizes were small enough to avoid singularity the constructed model s numerical parameters and its convergence and errors including parasite and shrinkage were carefully analyzed by akhlaghi amiri and hamouda 2013 the rectangular bubble relaxation stratified two phase flow in channel and flow in single pore elements as well as in different types of porous media were thoroughly studied the numerical parameters e g initialization time and diffusion coefficient were tuned to damp the parasite currents and minimize the shrinkage effect during the simulation time the constructed phase field simulation method was more evaluated in non isothermal two phase flow problems at different viscous capillary flow regimes and wettabilities by akhlaghi amiri and hamouda 2014 in complicated porous media and showed good agreement with the experimental observations it was later verified in simulation of more complex two phase flow problems in heterogenous media rokhforouz and akhlaghi amiri 2017a 2018 3 results and discussion the effects of the grain s shape and size approximations on transport behaviors under different capillary number and wettability conditions are addressed here using several sensitivity studies 3 1 effect of the grain shape simplification in the first section two phase displacement behavior in the base case fig 1 is compared with the simplified model containing circular grains fig 2a capillary number is defined as c a μ w u i n j σ and viscosity ratio is m μ w μ o where μ is the viscosity σis the interfacial tension u inj is the injection velocity besides w and o denote water and oil respectively the influence of wettability is addressed here for displacements with log ca 3 69 and log m 0 to quantify the degree of wettability contact angle θ is studied which is a boundary condition in determining the interfacial shape brown and neustadter 1980 rabbani et al 2017 the grain surface is considered water wet if θ π 2 and oil wet if θ π 2 fig 4 shows the fluid distributions at two instances for the base model the two left columns and the simplified one the two right columns respectively at different θ values of π 6 π 3 π 2 2π 3 and 5π 6 the first instance is just after 0 4 pore volume injection pvi of water and the other is after displacement stabilization the blue and the red colors represent water and oil phases respectively and the color gradient represents the interface mixing zone as the medium is water wet θ π 2 water injection represents an imbibition process while when the medium is oil wet θ π 2 it represents a drainage process as shown in fig 4 in both models as the contact angle increases the medium becomes more oil wet the displacement deviates from stable piston like pattern and becomes unstable containing fingerings which is in agreement with the reported experimental and numerical works akhlaghi amiri and hamouda 2014 anderson 1987b basirat et al 2017 celauro et al 2014 maaref et al 2017 martys et al 1991 morrow 1990 rabbani et al 2017 rokhforouz and akhlaghi amiri 2018 these instabilities are called capillary fingerings which occurs at low capillary numbers e g low injection rates or as non wetting phase displaces wetting phase lenormand et al 1988 akhlaghi amiri and hamouda 2014 they are normally appeared in the form of wide forward and lateral moving fronts lenormand et al 1988 however the simplified model could not accurately predict the details of the displacement including the morphology of the formed fingers and the trapped oil volumes in the medium as compared with the base model at θ π 6 the simplified model is almost swept by water while the base case contains numerous trapped oil volumes in the domain especially in the dead end pores this observation is also evident in other wettability states as the models become less water wet the swept area decreases corresponding to the previous reports jamaloei et al 2011 meybodi et al 2011 tweheyo et al 1999 comparison of fig 4 at θ π 6 and θ π 3 shows that in both models especially at the top of the media the bypassed oil drops become larger as θ increases from π 6 to π 3 as the medium becomes less water wet the capillary imbibition becomes weaker hence the injected water prefers to sweep larger pores and throats so it bypasses the smaller ones as depicted in fig at θ π 2 neutral wetting condition for the simplified model water is propagated through a regularly shaped water finger with the thickness in the order of two three pore sizes similarly at the same wettability for the base model there is a thick water finger however with less regularity in its shape and thickness compared to the model with circular grains for the oil wet media fig 4 at θ 2π 3 and 5π 6 the instability and complexity of the water profile increases especially in the base model with real grain shapes in the simplified model as the medium becomes more oil wet the number of active fingers increases while their thickness decreases this is less pronounced for the base case fig 5 compares the oil recovery factor rf as a function of water pvi for the base case fig 5a and the simplified model fig 5b at different grain s contact angles in general decreasing θ results in higher rf and a later breakthrough time in both models which is in agreement with the reported studies brown and neustadter 1980 celauro et al 2014 grattoni et al 1997 martys et al 1991 morrow 1990 owens and archer 1971 as discussed above fig 4 when the medium becomes less water wet the displacement profile changes from stable to unstable with fingerings hence rf decreases and water breakthrough is accelerated however it is observed in both models that the displacement has a lower ultimate rf and earlier water breakthrough time at θ π 2 neutral wetting condition compared to the one with θ 2π 3 slightly oil wet condition this is due to the progress of an additional finger through relatively large pores throats in the models with θ 2π 3 see fig 4 at θ π 3 compared to the ones with θ π 2 fig 4 at θ π 2 the medium with θ 5π 6 has the lowest rf around 0 4 in both models due to the high instability of the front and its relatively thin fingers unlike other wettabilities it is observed that at θ 5π 6 rf decreases after breakthrough time before stabilization this phenomenon happens due to thinning of some of the formed water fingerings which was also observed during non wetting phase injection in micromodel experimental maaref et al 2017 and numerical akhlaghi amiri and hamouda 2014 works in porous media with micro size dimensions i e with extremely low pore volume this fingerings deformation has a short term effect on rf as similarly captured in the work of basirat et al 2017 then rf is stabilized this kink in rf is more pronounced for the simplified model although ultimate rfs are almost similar in both models at oil wetting conditions the simplified model shows considerably higher rfs at water wet conditions for example in the base model with θ π 6 fig 5a ultimate oil rf is about 0 85 while it is 0 98 20 higher in the simplified model at the same wettability fig 5b this is due to the larger trapped oil volumes in the base model at water wet conditions compared to the simplified one as discussed earlier fig 4 at θ π 6 the macro scale capillary pressure in porous media depends on the contact angle wettability pore structure initial saturation and saturation history anderson 1987a it can be defined as the difference between the intrinsic phase average of the non wetting and wetting pressures ferrari and lunati 2013 whitaker 1977 10 δ p a v g p n w p w 11 p n w v p v f 2 d v v v f 2 d v p w v p v f 1 d v v v f 1 d v where pw and pnw denote wetting and non wetting fluids pressure respectively in addition vf1 and vf2 are the volume fraction of the wetting and non wetting fluids which are defined as v f 1 1 ϕ 2 v f 1 1 ϕ 2 fig 6 depicts the macro scale capillary pressure δpavg as a function of the water saturation sw for the base and the simplified models at different grain s contact angles it can be seen that in general the average of variations in δpavg increases as θ increases this indicates higher capillary pressure resistance in the case of less water wet media resulting in lower sweep efficiency as demonstrated in fig 5 fig 6 also shows unsteady fluctuations of macro scale capillary pressure with increasing water saturation these fluctuations which are known as haines jumps occur when the non wetting fluid passes from pore neck into a wider pore body during the drainage process armstrong et al 2015 berg et al 2013 once the invading fluid s pressure overcomes the capillary entry pressure of a pore throat the nearby pore body is filled swiftly at small θ values water wet conditions negative capillary pressures indicate the imbibition process water wet media has lower pressure fluctuations the main difference between the two diagrams is the range of pressure variations which is higher for the base model as shown in fig 6a the pressure varies between 1 and 6 kpa in the base case while it is between 1 and 4 kpa in the simplified one this difference is more pronounced in oil wet media the complexity of the shape of pores and throats in the base model is the main reason for this observation where the meandrous paths in this model result in higher pressure required to displace the fluids compared to the simplified one different pore scale mechanisms are observed in both models at various wetting conditions which highly affect the efficiency of the displacement figs 7 11 demonstrate some pore scale events which similarly happen in the base and simplified models these figures illustrate the events for enlarged sections of the models at four instants two instants in figure i and two instants in figure ii where the white contour in i represents the earlier instance while the black contour in ii shows the last one the dimensionless capillary pressure p c d is plotted as a function of the dimensionless time td for each of the four instances which is also compared in figs 7 11 for both models the dimensionless capillary pressure and time are defined as p c d p p c and td t u inj lc where pc is the capillary pressure p c σ cos θ l c and u inj is the injection velocity as depicted in instance i of fig 7a and b at water wet condition at θ π 6 water attaches the grain then water oil contact line movement takes place on the grain surface during the water imbibition process similarly in both models the oil phase film on the grain surface consequently narrows until the water phase surrounds the whole grain instance ii in fig 7a and b the trend and the range of variations in capillary pressure are also similar in both models capillary pressure first increases until the grain is contacted by water and shows an extremum at this moment then during contact line movement on the grain pc decreases since the two fluids do not mix a pressure difference does not dissipate this pressure difference may lead to water front progress in other zones fig 8 shows a pore level reverse displacement mechanism around a marked grain happened similarly in both models at θ π 6 in this mechanism the interface moves slightly in reverse direction and the interface s curvature is changed from almost convex instance i in fig 8a and b to concave instance ii in fig 8a and b this causes the interface to be forced back into the pore throat against the direction of the main stream flow due to this convex interface profile as shown in fig 8a and b the capillary pressure is negative at the initial moment in both models then it is increased during the reverse displacement process as the interface direction changes however the range of pressure variations is different this pressure gradient rise can be seen during water injection in that zone which causes water front progress in other zones fig 9 illustrates the interface coalescence mechanism which occurs in the same way for both media at θ π 6 two water oil interfaces from two sides meet each other on a grain surface instance i in fig 9a and b at a later time instance ii in fig 9a and b an interface coalescence mechanism happens in which the two interfaces join and form a single one then the new formed interface progresses in the medium in both models the capillary pressure has initially a negative sign due to the convex shape of the two approaching interfaces at the coalescence moment the capillary pressure becomes almost zero then becomes positive however due to different geometries of the two models the values of the pressures are not similar during displacement process in strongly oil wet media θ 5π 6 water bursting mechanism in the pores is evident as also observed by holtzman and segre 2015 as shown in fig 10 in both models water fingers form a blob shape as enter the wide pores instance i in fig 10a and b water bursting continued and the blob shaped water then expand until attach to the surrounding grains instance ii in fig 10a and b fig 10 also demonstrates the water snap off configuration especially in the simplified model due to the geometry of the simplified model the thickness of water fingers experiences a wavy shape in both models p c d shows a decreasing trend as the water blobs are formed and becomes larger the values of the resultant capillary pressures depend on the size of the blobs the enlarged views of different oil trapping mechanisms are shown in fig 11 which compares this phenomenon in the two models at different wettability conditions in general the oil trapping in the simplified model happens between at least two grains while in the case of the base model numerous oil volumes are observed which are trapped even within a single grain with a dead area for example in the case of the base model fig 11a at θ π 6 water phase bridges between two adjacent grains and the interface coalesce happens as a result the receding oil phase is entrapped in the dead end pore marked with a red square in the simplified model fig 11b with corresponding wettability θ π 6 however oil which surrounds a small grain is trapped between two other grains so three grains are involved in this process in the case of the base model fig 11a with θ 2π 3 the interfaces of two progressing water fingers approach together this causes entrapment of the receding fluid between the two adjacent grains in the case of the simplified model fig 11b with θ 2π 3 two instances of oil entrapment are depicted one of them shows the formation of an oil trap between two grains while the other one between three grains another oil trapping event in the base model happens due to the expansion of a water blob fig 11a at θ 5π 6 where this expansion exhibits a stick slip motion and confines the oil in the closed area of a single grain on the other hand at the same wettability in the simplified model fig 11b at θ 5π 6 an advancing water stream approaches two other stable ones and an oil volume which cannot find a pathway to exit is then trapped between three grains specified by the red mark in fig 12 the effect of the capillary number on displacement profiles for the base case is compared with the simplified model at θ 5π 6 for both models at low capillary number log ca 4 69 the water front stopped moving almost at the middle of the medium at low ca the injection pressure could not overcome the medium capillary resistance at oil wet conditions so the fluids moved to the symmetrical boundaries on the top and the bottom of the medium as capillary increased from log ca 3 69 to 2 69 although the oil recovery factor variation was negligible less than 3 for the two models the displacement profiles were slightly changed e g the formed water fingers became almost thinner these changes in displacement profile and finger morphology were more pronounced in the case of the simplified model fig 12b compared to the base model fig 12a some of the fingers in the simplified model became stretched at log ca 2 69 which is not the case at lower ca values 3 2 effect of the grain size approximation to understand the impact of the grain size approximation on the physics of the flow through porous media the modified model fig 2b was developed in which the randomly selected grains were resized by 10 in a random way fig 13 shows the stabilized fluid distributions in the modified model at different θ values wettability effect on the displacement profiles is quite similar to what was observed in fig 4 for the base model in other words increasing θ resulted in a deviation from piston like pattern to an unstable one containing capillary finger s consequently higher trapped oil volumes and thinner water fingers can be seen as θ increased or the medium became less water wet a general comparison of fig 13 the modified model and fig 4 the base model demonstrates that a slight modification of the model geometry affected both displacement pattern and efficiency especially at θ π 2 for example at θ π 2 in the base model fig 4 at θ π 2 the left columns water progressed to the outlet via one single finger while in the modified model fig 13 at θ π 2 two fingers were developed which one of them reached the outlet in the case of θ 2π 3 and 5π 6 fragmentation of the main fingers happened earlier in the base model fig 4 at θ π 3 and 5π 6 the left columns compared to the modified model fig 13 at θ π 3 and 5π 6 this resulted in a considerable trapped oil volume in the big pore at the middle of the medium in the case of the oil wet base model fig 4 at θ π 3 and 5π 6 the left column which is not the case in the modified one instead the oil is trapped in the top and the bottom sides of the modified model fig 13 at θ π 3 and 5π 6 these observations indicate that by modification of the grain sizes i e modification of the pore throat sizes the preferred path s of the injected phase was changed in other words a different distribution of capillarity was formed in the medium by slight grain size modification which affected the fluid distribution especially at neutral and oil wetting conditions fig 14 demonstrates the oil recovery factor as a function of the water pore volume injected in the modified model at different grain s contact angles general comparison of fig 14 the modified model and fig 5a the base case show almost similar trends of rf in both models at different wettabilities however as shown in fig 14 the profiles of rf versus pvi for the two cases of θ π 2 and θ 2π 3 are almost coincident while in the case of the base model fig 5a rf was higher at θ 2π 3 compared to that of θ π 2 as depicted in fig 13 at θ π 2 there are two water fingers in the medium after stabilization while in the base model fig 4 at θ π 2 the left column water progressed via one single finger this is due to the small difference between these two studied media in distribution of the capillary paths which resulted in a higher rf of the modified model compared to the base case at θ π 2 the effects of capillary number on displacement profiles are compared for the two models at θ 5π 6 in fig 15 in the case of the displacement at the lowest ca log ca 4 69 injection pressure cannot overcome capillary resistance thus the water front stopped moving before reaching the outlet similar to what was observed in the case of the base and simplified models fig 12 however the stabilized fluid distribution in the modified model at log ca 4 69 is completely different from that of the base model the formed finger has a different morphology and it progressed deeper into the medium in the case of the modified model compared to the base case this progressed finger in the case of the modified model fig 15 log ca 4 69 could find wide pore throats in its path so progressed deeper by overcoming the medium capillary resistance while in the case of the base model fig 12a log ca 4 69 the water finger could not meet such a desirable pathway for movement by increasing ca from log ca 3 69 to 2 69 the swept area by water was considerably about 10 increased due to the formation of new small fingers in different parts of the medium fig 15 4 conclusion although the general view of the displacement pattern was almost similar for the base model and the simplified one with circular grains the displacement details were modified fingering morphology ultimate recovery capillary pressure distribution and also pore scale oil trapping mechanism were different especially at oil wet media the simplification of the medium resulted in a higher oil recovery in strongly water wet medium and a lower oil recovery in strongly oil wet media the range of macro scale capillary pressure of the simplified model was less than that of the base case at oil wetting conditions oil was trapped between at least two grains in the simplified model while dead end corners of the grains were the main area for oil trapping in the base model however other pore scale events e g grain surrounding reverse displacement interface coalescence and water bursting and the related capillary pressure variations were similarly captured in both models modification of the model with slight changing the grain sizes resulted in generally different flow profiles and trapped oil distributions especially at neutral and oil wetting conditions θ π 2 even small modification of the grain sizes changed the preferred paths of the displacing phase fingering s due to modification of the capillarity in the medium the oil recovery factor in the simplified model was increased at neutral wetting condition compared to the base model at low capillary numbers log ca 3 69 and at oil wetting conditions the difference between the modified model and the base case was exaggerated the results of this study shed light upon the importance of the model geometrical accuracy in simulation of displacements at pore scale in general it was found that the effect of the medium grain geometry on fluid flow becomes more pronounced when the medium capillarity effect becomes higher log ca 4 69 and at oil wet conditions acknowledgments this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors 
704,the relationship between leaf water potential transpiration rate and soil water potential is complex particularly when the soil water potential in the root zone is not uniform which is the rule rather than the exception in soils our objectives were 1 to measure the effect of heterogeneous soil water potentials on the relation between leaf water potential and transpiration rate and 2 to test whether root water uptake models could predict this relation to this end we combined the root pressure chamber technique which allows measuring the suction in the leaves of transpiring plants with two models of root water uptake a simple one where soil and roots are presented as resistances in series and a more detailed 3d root architecture model the experiments were carried out with lupines grown in sandy soil for which the root architecture and root hydraulic properties had been previously estimated the soil was partitioned in two layers separated by a coarse sand layer that allowed the roots to grow through but limited the water redistribution between the layers three scenarios wet wet dry wet dry dry were tested the results showed that the relation between transpiration and leaf water potential was linear in all scenarios as the upper soil layer severely dried the conductance of the soil plant system decreased by ca 1 65 times compared to the conductance of the plant soil system in a uniform wet soil as both layers dried the conductivity was 8 26 times lower compared to the uniform wet case the combination of the experiment and modelling showed that a simple model is capable to reproduce the relation between transpiration leaf water potential and soil water potential despite an offset in the leaf water potential both simplified and the 3d root architecture models were capable of reproducing the measured changes in hydraulic conductance of the plant soil system due to the soil drying however both models overestimated the measured leaf water potential by 0 1 mpa probably because of a gradient in osmotic potential between the xylem and the soil the simulations predicted the occurrence of hydraulic lift even at day time conditions although the hydraulic lift was relatively more important at low transpiration rates the simulation suggested that a root architecture model is needed to estimate the variations of water uptake along the individual roots and this might be crucial to properly model hydraulic lift key words hydraulic lift lupin lupinus albus l root architecture root pressure chamber transpiration rates 1 introduction plants transpire large volume of water and understanding what processes control transpiration is important to properly predict water transfer across the soil and the atmosphere transpiration rates are controlled by atmospheric conditions and above ground plant properties such as leaf area and stomata conductance ahmed et al 2018 high vapour pressure deficit vpd induce high transpiration rates and loss of leaf water potential kholova et al 2010 will et al 2013 although transpiration does not depend directly on leaf water status the dependence of stomata conductance on it results in an indirect relation between leaf water potential and transpiration tardieu et al 2015 for instance it has been hypothesized that plant closes stomata to avoid abrupt increase in xylem tension and reduce the risks of xylem cavitation sperry et al 2002 water flows from the soil into the root across the plant vascular system and then across the stomata to the atmosphere following a gradient in water potential transpiration is the driving force of this process transpiration generates a suction in the leaves driving water from the soil into the roots as the soil dries its water potential and hydraulic conductivity decrease and a more negative leaf water potential is needed for sustaining a given transpiration rate the effect of drought on physiological traits such as stomatal conductance and leaf water potential is well documented e g mitchell et al 2013 thomas 2000 tognetti et al 1995 in this study we investigated the role of soil drying on the relation between leaf water potential and transpiration the effect of soil drying on root water uptake has been experimentally and numerically investigated since decades doussan et al 2006 jarvis 1989 javaux et al 2008 tardieu et al 2017 in wet soils the soil hydraulic conductivity has little effect on water uptake as the hydraulic resistance of the root is much greater than that of the soil draye et al 2010 and the difference in water potential between soil and leaf xylem is linearly related to transpiration passioura 1980 the situation changes as the soil becomes progressively dry when its hydraulic conductivity decreases and the leaf suction that is needed to drive water from the soil into the roots increases non linearly carminati et al 2017 passioura 1980 this non linearity comes from 1 microscopic gradients in water potential across the rhizosphere mm scale and 2 macroscopic gradients in water potential along the root system dm scale macroscopic gradients in soil water potential along the root system are the consequence of non uniform root water uptake doussan et al 2006 javaux et al 2008 in a typical drying scenario neglecting precipitation or irrigation events the top soil is earlier depleted because of higher root density and because of dissipation of water potential along the root system ahmed et al 2016 zarebanadkouki et al 2016b 2013 as the upper soil layers dry water uptake shifts to deeper soil regions doussan et al 2006 jarvis 1989 in such conditions roots have been reported to redistribute water from deep wet soil layers to the upper dry soil layers in the process called hydraulic lift hl meunier et al 2017 richards and caldwell 1987 the magnitude of hl depends on biological and environmental variables including atmospheric water demand the root distribution over depth and gradients in soil water potential burgess et al 2001 meinzer et al 2004 domec et al 2012 reported that large volumes of water are transported by deep roots to the top soil if the soil texture allows a large potential gradient to occur hl occurs mainly at night time when transpiration is low and it is reduced by residual water potential gradient generated by plant water storage and nocturnal transpiration huang et al 2017 water supplied by hl can keep fine roots hydrated domec et al 2004 and delay drying of top soil layers brooks et al 2006 therefore sustaining water uptake during drought yu and d odorico 2015 2014 discussed the role of soil drying in hl and showed that hl is determinant for the coexistence of tree and grass on savannas despite these advancements in our understanding of processes controlling hl and the dynamics of root water uptake in drying soils several open questions remain 1 models of hl typically overestimate the rates of hl neumann and cardon 2012 2 models of root water uptake that explicitly simulate water flow in soil and roots doussan et al 2006 javaux et al 2008 require a large number of parameters that are not easily measurable one alternative to detailed root water uptake models e g doussan et al 2006 javaux et al 2008 has been proposed by couvreur et al 2012 who showed that the equivalent soil water potential is the average soil water potential weighed based on the local water fluxes in their model the transpiration rate is equal to the plant conductance multiplied by the xylem collar water potential minus the equivalent soil water potential this simplified approach is an advantage compared to more detailed hydraulic models because it needs fewer parameters however although this simplified model explicitly simulates the water potential in the xylem collar it has not been systematically tested versus measurements of xylem collar potential for varying transpiration rates and soil moisture distribution finally it is not clear whether simplified and detailed models of root water uptake differ in the prediction of hl our working hypothesis is that monitoring xylem water potential and transpiration for varying soil moisture distribution is a key to test models of root water uptake and hl therefore the objectives of this paper were i to measure the relation between leaf xylem water potential and transpiration rates for heterogeneous soil water distributions ii to test the ability of a detailed root water uptake model javaux et al 2008 and of a simplified model couvreur et al 2012 to reproduce the experimental relation between xylem water potential and transpiration rates iii to compare the hl simulated by the detailed and simplified model for the objective i we applied the root pressure chamber method developed by passioura 1980 to lupines lupinus albus l growing in sandy soils with three soil water distributions 1 the upper and lower layers were wet homogeneous water content 2 the upper soil layer was let dry while the lower one was maintained wet heterogeneous water content and 3 both soil layers were let dry homogeneous water content the method was used to monitor the leaf suction for varying transpiration rates and the three degrees of soil water contents 1 3 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil and plant preparation lupines were grown in pvc columns of 30 cm height and 14 cm diameter the pots were filled with quartz sand particle size 500 µm the soil retention curve and the soil hydraulic conductivity of sand were characterized using the extended evaporation method peters and durner 2008 schindler et al 2010 this method was implemented in hyprop ums munich germany a commercial device that monitors evaporation rates and soil matric potentials at two depths a soil core of 5 cm in length and 4 cm in diameter was filled with quartz sand at a bulk density of 1 52 g cm 3 soil matric potential at two depths and evaporation rate were recorded during drying at the constant temperature of 25 c the hydraulic parameters were estimated by inversely simulating the measured matric potentials solving the richard s equation the richard s equation was solved in matlab 2016 using a fully implicit euler time discretization and a centred finite difference space discretization scheme celia and binning 1992 soil water retention curve and the hydraulic conductivity curve were parameterized using the pdi model peters durner iden model peters et al 2015 and were inversely adjusted to best reproduce soil water content and matric potentials the soil columns were partitioned into two soil layers separated at a depth of 13 cm by one cm thick layer of fine gravel particle size of 2 3 mm this layer of fine gravel was used to hydraulically disconnect the upper and lower soil layers without hindering root growth so that we could easily impose heterogeneous soil water contents fig 1 a the pots were filled in such a way that the packed soil bulk density was 1 4 g cm 3 several holes with a diameter of 1 5 mm were placed at the bottom and sides of the pots the holes at the bottom allowed water drainage and the holes on sides allowed to inject water using a fine needle the soil surface of each pot was covered with fine gravels from 2 to 3 5 mm to minimize evaporation from the soil surface lupine seeds were germinated on moist filter paper for 24 h and then planted into the pots one seed per pot the plants were grown in a climate room with a photoperiod of 14 h day night temperature of 25 c 22 c and light intensity of 200 µmol m 2 s 1 during the first two weeks the samples were regularly irrigated to maintain the soil water content in both compartments at approximately 25 after the root system grew throughout both compartments the soil water content was adjusted to the following three scenarios i both the top and bottom soil layers were kept at a water content of 15 20 wet wet ii the top compartment was let dry to a water content of 2 5 while the bottom compartment was kept at a water content between 15 20 dry wet and iii both top and bottom compartments were let dry to a water content of 2 5 dry dry the soil moisture was gravimetrically determined every three days by collecting soil samples in each soil layer using a micro auger the soil moisture content was measured at three different heights 4 8 and 12 cm from the bottom in the bottom compartment and at three points 18 22 and 26 cm from the bottom in the top compartment 2 2 root pressure chamber the root pressure chamber method allows measuring the relationship between transpiration rate and the pressure drop across the plant soil continuum the technique is described in detail in passioura 1980 the pvc cylinders filled with soils and the intact and growing roots were enclosed in a pressure chamber with a sealing at the root shoot junction fig 1b the plant shoot remained outside the pressure chamber and was illuminated horizontally by a led lamp varying the distance between led and shoots provided a photosynthetic photon intensity ranging from 98 9 to 1334 µmol m 2 s 1 the photosynthetic photon intensity was changed to impose different transpiration rates transpiration was estimated gravimetrically by weighing the pots between two different time intervals one leaf was cut and the pneumatic pressure in the chamber was increased until a drop of water at a cut leaf fig 1c note that the chamber was pressurized with 99 999 vol n2 the pressure needed to maintain the drop of water at the cut leaf is called balancing pressure pbalancing and it is equal to the suction in the xylem prior to pressurization passioura 1980 plants were imposed to three different transpiration rates by changing the photosynthetic photon intensity and let transpire for 30 min thereafter the balancing pressure and the transpiration rates were measured the root pressure chamber experiments started when the plants were 45 days old the experiments were performed for three scenarios of soil moisture contents wet wet dry wet dry dry and three transpiration rates prior to the experiments the soil moisture in each compartment was determined by collecting soil samples using micro auger through the holes in the pots we measured soil moisture contents in each compartment recorded the transpiration rate g h 1 and the balancing pressure hpa at each light intensity for all replications the time interval between each measurement was 30 min we performed three replications for both uniformly wet and top dry bottom wet and one replication for uniformly dry scenarios 2 3 root collection at the end of each experiment the soil was gently washed away from the roots the roots grown in each compartment were collected and their total root length and radius were measured with the software winrhizo 2008a image analysis system reagent instruments inc canada the root segments were opened on a3 plexiglass tray of the winrhizo flatbed scanner epson std 4800 equipped with a double light source to avoid root overlapping the images were acquired using the twain interface at 800 dpi resolution the root distribution in both compartments is shown in table s1 supplementary data 2 4 simplified model of root water uptake couvreur et al 2012 showed that the relation between transpiration rate q cm3 h 1 collar xylem water potential hx hpa and soil matric potential h s hpa can be written as 1 q k r s h x h s e q where krs is the equivalent conductance cm3 hpa 1 h 1 of the root system and h s eq is an equivalent soil water potential averaged according to the ohm analogy note that hx and h s eq are the sum of the gravitational and hydrostatic potential matric potential for the soil eq 1 predicts that the relation between transpiration rate and the hydraulic gradient is linear and that at no transpiration the leaf water potential is equal to that of the soil i e there is an equilibrium between xylem and soil water eq 1 neglects difference in osmotic potential between xylem and soil the osmotic potential can be added in eq 1 as 2 q k r s h x h s e q σ h x o s m o t i c h s o s m o t i c where h x osmotic and h s osmotic are the osmotic potential hpa in the xylem and soil and σ is the reflection coefficient which is 1 for selective membrane and 0 for non selective membrane neglecting the osmotic potential is equivalent to assume that there is no membrane limiting the transport of solutes from the soil solution to the xylem or that the osmotic potential in the xylem and the soil are equivalent in this study we used eq 1 possible offsets between measured and simulated h s eq could be explained by the osmotic pressure in eq 2 to illustrate the meaning of the parameters krs and h s eq we choose a simplified root system illustrated in fig 2 representing the experimental setup for this set up krs and h s eq are given by 3 k r s 1 k x 1 1 1 k r 1 k s 1 h 1 1 k x 2 k r 2 k s 2 h 1 1 where k r1 k r2 are the radial conductances cm3 hpa 1 h 1 of the roots in the upper and lower soil layers k x1 and k x2 are the axial conductances cm3 hpa 1 h 1 of the roots in the upper and lower soil layers and k s1 h k s2 h are the conductances cm3 hpa 1 h 1 of the soil calculated as nobel and cui 1992 4 k s h 2 π l l n r s o i l r r o o t k h where rsoil is the radius of the soil cylinder rroot is the root radius l is the length of the root segment

and the soil water potential needs to be expressed as centimetre heads 1 hpa 1 cm the equivalent soil water potential is given by 5 h s e q 1 k r 1 k s 1 h 1 1 k r 1 k s 1 h 1 1 k x 2 k r 2 k s 2 h 1

which the soil matric potentials h s1 and h s2 are multiplied is 1 the measured balancing pressure pbalancing hpa is numerically equivalent to the suction in the xylem 6 p b a l a n c i n g h x where the gravitational potential at the xylem collar is set to zero if the osmotic potential of soil and xylem are equivalent or the reflection coefficient is null pbalancing is equivalent to minus the

model without osmotic potential eq 1 to fit the measured q p relation 2 5 modelling of water flow into root system the hydraulic tree model of doussan et al 1998 and implemented as in javaux et al 2008 was used to simulate root water uptake the root architecture is represented as a system of interconnected nodes in which water flows radially from the root xylem and longitudinally along the xylem vessels the root system is divided into small segments with uniform length of 5 10 2 cm the radial flow qr cm3 h 1 between the soil root interface and root xylem is 8 q r k r s r h s h x k r h s h x where h s and hx are the water potential at root surface and in the xylem hpa respectively sr is the cross section of root segment cm2 kr is the root radial conductivity cm hpa 1 h 1 and kr is the radial conductance of the segment cm3 hpa 1 h 1 in eq 8 qr is negative when the flow is towards the root i e it is minus the root water uptake the total water potential is the sum of matric potential and the gravitational potential while the osmotic potential is not taken into account this equation does not take into account the dissipation of water potential in the soil therefore to include the conductance of the soil this equation was modified as 9 q r k e f f h s h x where keff is an effective radial conductance of root soil system cm3 hpa 1 h 1 calculated as following 10 1 k e f f 1 1 k s h 1 k r where ks h is an effective soil hydraulic conductance given by 11 k s h 2 π l l n r s o i l r r o o t k h where k h is soil hydraulic conductivity as a function of the matric potential h l is the length of root segment cm here it is assumed that each root with radius rroot has access to a cylindrical region with an outer radius of r s o i l v t o t π l t o t where vtot is the soil volume cm3 and ltot is the total root length cm eq 11 assumes no change in hydraulic conductivity as a function of distance to the root surface and therefore underestimates the gradient in water potential around the roots the axial water flow within each root segment qx cm3 h 1 is described as 12 q x k x l d h x k x d h x d z where hx is water potential in xylem kx is axial conductivity cm4 hpa 1 h 1 hx is xylem hydrostatic potential z is the distance of each segment from the soil surface cm and kx is axial conductivity applying these equations to all nodes of the root system the radial flow of water into each root segment can be described as a system of linear equations the details were descripted in zarebanadkouki et al 2016a b and doussan et al 1998 the model was used to fit the root pressure chamber experiments and to calculate the water uptake in each compartment note that the model can only simulate steady state conditions and no changes in soil water content this assumption is justified by the small time scale of the experiments and the consequent small amount of water removed from the soil samples during the measurements less than 0 1 changes in the water contained in the sample additionally the model does not include the osmotic potential 2 6 model parameterization the linear system of eqs 8 12 was solved in matlab 2016 under fixed soil water potential and transpiration rates which was measured during pressure chamber experiments taken as boundary conditions the soil matric potential was obtained from the soil retention curve and the measured soil water content at three different points in each compartment the soil water potential was assumed to be uniform within each soil layer the soil hydraulic conductivity was estimated using hyprop ums munich germany and assumed to be uniform in each compartment the root architecture was extracted from previous experiments zarebanadkouki et al 2013 the profile of axial and radial conductances was taken from the estimation of zarebanadkouki et al 2016a b these root properties were used as initial guess to fit xylem water potential and to simulate water uptake for all the three soil moisture scenarios wet wet dry wet dry dry after implementation and parameterization of the root architecture model of doussan et al 1998 a forward simulation approach was used to estimate the profile of root water uptake and xylem water potential along the root system of plants growing at different soil water contents and being imposed to different transpiration rates which was measured during pressure chamber experiment given the boundary condition and the transpiration rates the estimated xylem water potential at the collar of the plant was compared with the balancing pressure obtained from the pressure chamber as the osmotic component of water potential in the soil and the xylem was neglected during our modelling approach not known to us the estimated value of balancing pressure would not be comparable to the measured value to compare the measured and estimated value of balancing pressure a constant value was added to the simulated xylem water potential at the collar of the plant this constant is equal to the difference in osmotic potential between the soil surface or a point outside the endodermis and the leaf xylem eq 7 and varied between different scenarios note that as we did not simulate soil water distribution over time the choice of using a different architecture from a quasi 2d container is not critical instead the distribution of radial and axial conductances as well as their absolute values is critical and so is the total root length note also that the total root length in the simulation and in the experiments was similar we started from the root parameters derived by zarebanadkouki et al 2016a b and adapted them to match the experimental results 3 results the fitting of the soil evaporation experiment the water retention curve and hydraulic conductivity are shown in fig 3 the sandy soil was characterized by a steep decrease in water content at a matric potential between 40 and 100 hpa and a corresponding drop in hydraulic conductivity the comprehensive data set of pressure chamber experiments are shown in fig 4 together with the fitting of the simplified model and the root architecture model see also supplementary data table s2 fig 4 shows the relationship between transpiration rate and balancing pressure for the three different scenarios wet wet dry wet dry dry the relationship between transpiration and balancing pressure was linear in all scenarios the slope of the curves which is interpreted as the conductance of the soil root system decreased by a factor of 1 65 from the wet wet to the dry wet treatment in the dry dry treatment the conductance was severely reduced by a factor of 8 26 and the transpiration was also strongly reduced the intercept the balancing pressure at null transpiration decreased from 1040 hpa in the wet wet scenario to ca 1700 hpa in the other two scenarios dry wet and dry dry the linear relation of eq 1 is capable of fitting the measurements the fitting parameters are reported in table 1 let us now discuss the meaning of the parameters krs and h s eq we start with h s eq for the wet soil layer θ 15 20 we expect a soil matric potential of 30 to 50 hpa for the dry soil θ 2 5 we expect a soil matric potential of ca 1000 hpa but because the shape of the water retention curve fig 3 the error in the dry range is expected to be high for the wet wet scenario with both layers at a matric potential 50 hpa eq 1 would give an equivalent soil water potential of 50 hpa which is far from the measured h s eq in table 1 it means that an additional potential of ca 1000 hpa acts on the plant one explanation is that this additional potential is of osmotic nature and could be caused by a difference in osmotic potential between the xylem and a point before the endodermis being it the cortex or the root soil interface as predicted by eq 7 we will discuss this and other explanations in the discussion and conclusions for the dry dry scenario the fitted h s eq is 1700 hpa because the matric potential is highly variable in sand it is possible that the offset of 1000 hpa was still acting in the dry dry soil with the soil matric potential explaining the remaining 700 hpa or that the soil matric potential was 1700 hpa for the dry wet scenario we expect that the soil conductance reduces the importance of h s1 on h s eq in other words we expect that the plant would feel mainly the water potential of the lower soil layer where most of the water is taken up from eq 5 would predict h s eq to be close to the matric potential of the wet lower soil layers however because of the uncertainties in the offset the claimed osmotic potential would be difficult to make a conclusive statement indeed it could be that the offset becomes more negative or that the soil matric potential in the upper layer was much more negative than 1000 hpa in summary from the analysis of h s eq it results that the h s eq becomes more negative as the soil dries out as expected however the value of h s eq seems to be more negative than the one expected particularly in wet soils the origin of such deviation is probably of osmotic nature originating from a difference in osmotic potential between the xylem and the root surface the latter being at more negative osmotic potential than the xylem as given by eq 7 other explanations are discussed later in the discussion and conclusions the plant conductances krs were analyzed according to eqs 3 and 4 the simplified model is capable to describe the measured krs taking a reasonable soil conductivity of k 10 5 cm s 1 for the wet layers and k 3 10 11 cm s 1 for the dry ones based on fig 3 and inversely estimating the radial and axial conductances of the simplified root system shown in fig 2 gives a good match of the measured krs without additional assumptions the obtained conductances are shown in table 2 in the wet soil layers the soil conductance 36 cm3 h 1 hpa 1 was much higher than the radial root conductance 7 20 10 4 but in dry soils the soil conductance was much lower 1 08 10 4 this explains the reduction of krs in dry soil layers in summary the simplified model is capable of reproducing the relation between leaf suction and transpiration for varying soil moistures and the soil and root conductances to explain such behaviour are physically sound note that the objective of these calculations was not to determine the conductances of the different root segments but rather to test whether eq 3 could be used to reproduce the relation between leaf suction and transpiration with physically sound parameters this was the case for the conductances but not for the equivalent soil water potential particularly in drying soils once these conductances are estimated they can be used to predict the local water uptakes in each scenario table 3 the more complex architecture model based on the parameterization of zarebanadkouki et al 2016a b was capable to reproduce the measurements provided that the simulated xylem water potential at the plant collar was reduced by 1000 hpa as for the simplified model this value can be interpreted as the osmotic potential difference between the xylem and a point outside the endodermis for all curves the relation between transpiration rate and leaf suction was linear the intercept of the line with x axis indicates the equivalent soil water potential experienced by the plant note that the root distribution in each compartment was equal i e 50 the root architecture model provides the water potential in the root system fig 5 shows the distribution at medium light intensity when the soil was uniformly wet the root system felt almost the same water potential in both compartments and there was a little dissipation of water potential along the root system particularly along the tap root in the dry wet scenario fig 5b the roots in the upper dry compartment were at much more negative water potential than the roots in the lower wet compartment interestingly the tips of the roots in the upper dry compartment were at a more negative potential than the corresponding more proximal segments indicating water efflux from the root tips in the dry dry soils the root system was at a more negative but rather uniform water potential with similar gradients from the tips of the lateral roots to the tap root the model also yields the profile of the radial fluxes m s 1 into the roots fig 6 in wet wet soil fig 6a the contribution of radial flux was rather uniform along the root system indicating a moderate dissipation of water potential along the depth in dry wet soil fig 6b the uptake in upper dry soil was much smaller compared to that in the lower wet layer in the dry dry scenario the water fluxes were strongly reduced in both soil layers this detailed root hydraulic architecture gives the relative water uptake in the upper and lower soil layers for each scenario in homogeneous soil water content scenarios wet wet dry dry water uptake was slightly higher in the upper compartment than in the lower despite the root length being imposed to be 50 50 table 4 this was caused by the dissipation of water potential along the roots in the dry dry condition the relative uptake in the upper and lower soil layers was almost the same as in the wet wet conditions the reason was that the difference in water potential between soil and root was larger compared to dissipation along the root in both conditions wet wet dry dry there was no effect of varying transpiration on the relative water uptake when the soil water content was not uniform dry wet the relative water uptake changed with varying transpiration rates at high transpiration rates water was taken up from the wet soil and it was released by the roots in the upper compartment the process referred to as hydraulic lift at decreasing transpiration rates hydraulic lift increased significantly the main difference between the two models is in the hydraulic lift which is higher in the root architecture model 4 discussion and conclusions we showed that the relation between leaf water potential and transpiration rate was linear at both uniform and heterogeneous water contents distribution and it could be well fitted with both a simple model couvreur et al 2012 and a detailed root architecture model of water uptake at uniform soil moisture distribution either being wet wet or dry dry scenario the relative root water uptake depended uniquely on the root properties and its distribution along the root system did not vary with transpiration rate in the dry wet scenarios root water uptake is predicted to shift to the lower and wet layer and both models predicted the occurrence of hydraulic lift in the upper dry soil layer the slope of the transpiration rate versus balancing pressure which is interpreted as the soil plant conductance decreased by a factor of 8 26 in the dry dry scenario as compared to the wet wet scenario indicating the limiting role of the soil conductivity on root water uptake in contrast to the measurements by passioura 1980 and carminati et al 2017 we found a linear relation between transpiration and balancing pressure also in dry soil however it is likely that in the present study we did not reach transpiration rates high enough to observe the deviations from the linear relationship and the consequent hysteric behaviour reported in the studies above similarly to carminati et al 2017 we found an offset in the balancing pressure which we interpreted as the effect of the difference in osmotic potential between the xylem and the soil eqs 2 and 7 osmotic potential of ca 0 1 mpa are reported in the classic work by fiscus 1977 and are consistent with our interpretations another explanation of the offset is that at low flow rates i e q 0 the relation between transpiration and leaf xylem water potential is not linear this could be caused by capacitance effects with the plant tissues being slowly rehydrated the models employed here did not include plant capacitance and although we could argue that for young lupines plant capacitance should not play a big role we cannot conclude that the model simplification introduced some error at low flow rates another explanation is that roots extracted water from a small soil volume which could have become significantly drier than the bulk soil however such moisture gradients are not expected in wet soils as in the wet wet scenario and should have quickly disappeared when the upper soil layer was dry the soil plant conductance decreased by a factor of 1 65 compared to wet wet scenario both the simplified and the architecture models were capable to reproduce the results the parameterization based on the data from zarebanadkouki et al 2016a b well fitted the data without any need to adjust the parameters this might be a coincidence as the plants in this study were 2 weeks older possibly the fact that here the conductance of the shoot from the collar to the cut leaf is not included can explain the quality of the fit it could be that the actual root conductance of this study was slightly higher than that in zarebanadkouki et al 2016a b and neglecting the shoot conductance resulted in this good fit the simulations predicted that the location of water uptake shifted to the lower soil region while a significant amount of water taken up by the roots in the wet region was released from the root tips into the upper dry soil layer in the process referred to as hydraulic lift caldwell et al 1998 richards and caldwell 1987 hl is known to increase at low transpiration rates at low transpiration rates the root architecture model predicted a hydraulic lift corresponding to ca 28 of the transpiration 0 49 mm water day 1 which is within the range in the literature neumann and cardon 2012 scott et al 2008 yu and d odorico 2014 interestingly the architecture model predicts hydraulic lift also at high transpiration rates and not just when transpiration is low the impacts of hydraulic lift on ecohydrological and soil processes are manifold it supports shallow rooted competitors dawson 1993 hawkins et al 2009 moreira et al 2003 yu and d odorico 2015 it maintains root in contact with drying soil bauerle et al 2008 domec et al 2004 and it stimulates microbial activity lehto and zwiazek 2011 wang et al 2009 hydraulic lift also alters the profiles of soil moisture and impacts carbon assimilation canopy transpiration and the water use efficiency during dry season amenu and kumar 2008 manoli et al 2017 also showed that hydraulic redistribution produced by deep rooted trees enhances ecosystem resilience to drought and maintains photosynthesis in shallow rooted trees in summary this study shows the potential of combining the root pressure chamber method which allows for monitoring the average leaf suction in intact transpiring plants exposed to soil drying with hydraulics model of water uptake both root water uptake models were capable to reproduce the measured relationship between transpiration and leaf water potential however the models differ in the prediction of hydraulic lift the detailed architecture model allows for assigning variable hydraulic conductivities to different root segments according to parameterization by zarebanadkouki et al 2016a b the root tips were the most radially conductive regions and these are the locations where hydraulic lift takes place the simplified model summarizes all the different root conductivities in effective terms and predicts less hydraulic lift from this comparison between the models we conclude that a simplified model is sufficient to describe the relationship between leaf water potential and transpiration but a more detailed model is needed to understand the mechanisms impacting hydraulic lift concerning hydraulic lift we cannot conclude on which model is better because we have not measured hydraulic lift however the more detailed model is more adequate to calculate water potential gradients and fluxes along the root system such a model should be used to test open questions such as the potential mechanisms plants employ to control hydraulic lift for instance root exudation of mucilage induces water repellency in the rhizosphere and it is likely to reduce water fluxes zarebanadkouki et al 2016a similarly root shrinkage and the consequent loss of contacts between soil and roots carminati et al 2013 will reduce the leakage of water from the roots since it is known that current models overestimate hl neumann and cardon 2012 including such dynamic processes at the root soil interface into existing models would be interesting in this case the water flow into and from the root should account for soil capacitance and its hysteresis which was not done in the present study where radial flow to the roots was solved assuming steady state conditions in analogy with what has been done for plant tissues it could be found that rhizosphere capacitances decrease modelled hl huang et al 2017 dynamic processes at the root soil interface and their impact on hydraulic lift deserve further studies and would require high spatial resolution measurements of water fluxes along the root system optimally such studies would allow for a better understanding of how root soil interactions impact water fluxes at day and night acknowledgment

704,the relationship between leaf water potential transpiration rate and soil water potential is complex particularly when the soil water potential in the root zone is not uniform which is the rule rather than the exception in soils our objectives were 1 to measure the effect of heterogeneous soil water potentials on the relation between leaf water potential and transpiration rate and 2 to test whether root water uptake models could predict this relation to this end we combined the root pressure chamber technique which allows measuring the suction in the leaves of transpiring plants with two models of root water uptake a simple one where soil and roots are presented as resistances in series and a more detailed 3d root architecture model the experiments were carried out with lupines grown in sandy soil for which the root architecture and root hydraulic properties had been previously estimated the soil was partitioned in two layers separated by a coarse sand layer that allowed the roots to grow through but limited the water redistribution between the layers three scenarios wet wet dry wet dry dry were tested the results showed that the relation between transpiration and leaf water potential was linear in all scenarios as the upper soil layer severely dried the conductance of the soil plant system decreased by ca 1 65 times compared to the conductance of the plant soil system in a uniform wet soil as both layers dried the conductivity was 8 26 times lower compared to the uniform wet case the combination of the experiment and modelling showed that a simple model is capable to reproduce the relation between transpiration leaf water potential and soil water potential despite an offset in the leaf water potential both simplified and the 3d root architecture models were capable of reproducing the measured changes in hydraulic conductance of the plant soil system due to the soil drying however both models overestimated the measured leaf water potential by 0 1 mpa probably because of a gradient in osmotic potential between the xylem and the soil the simulations predicted the occurrence of hydraulic lift even at day time conditions although the hydraulic lift was relatively more important at low transpiration rates the simulation suggested that a root architecture model is needed to estimate the variations of water uptake along the individual roots and this might be crucial to properly model hydraulic lift key words hydraulic lift lupin lupinus albus l root architecture root pressure chamber transpiration rates 1 introduction plants transpire large volume of water and understanding what processes control transpiration is important to properly predict water transfer across the soil and the atmosphere transpiration rates are controlled by atmospheric conditions and above ground plant properties such as leaf area and stomata conductance ahmed et al 2018 high vapour pressure deficit vpd induce high transpiration rates and loss of leaf water potential kholova et al 2010 will et al 2013 although transpiration does not depend directly on leaf water status the dependence of stomata conductance on it results in an indirect relation between leaf water potential and transpiration tardieu et al 2015 for instance it has been hypothesized that plant closes stomata to avoid abrupt increase in xylem tension and reduce the risks of xylem cavitation sperry et al 2002 water flows from the soil into the root across the plant vascular system and then across the stomata to the atmosphere following a gradient in water potential transpiration is the driving force of this process transpiration generates a suction in the leaves driving water from the soil into the roots as the soil dries its water potential and hydraulic conductivity decrease and a more negative leaf water potential is needed for sustaining a given transpiration rate the effect of drought on physiological traits such as stomatal conductance and leaf water potential is well documented e g mitchell et al 2013 thomas 2000 tognetti et al 1995 in this study we investigated the role of soil drying on the relation between leaf water potential and transpiration the effect of soil drying on root water uptake has been experimentally and numerically investigated since decades doussan et al 2006 jarvis 1989 javaux et al 2008 tardieu et al 2017 in wet soils the soil hydraulic conductivity has little effect on water uptake as the hydraulic resistance of the root is much greater than that of the soil draye et al 2010 and the difference in water potential between soil and leaf xylem is linearly related to transpiration passioura 1980 the situation changes as the soil becomes progressively dry when its hydraulic conductivity decreases and the leaf suction that is needed to drive water from the soil into the roots increases non linearly carminati et al 2017 passioura 1980 this non linearity comes from 1 microscopic gradients in water potential across the rhizosphere mm scale and 2 macroscopic gradients in water potential along the root system dm scale macroscopic gradients in soil water potential along the root system are the consequence of non uniform root water uptake doussan et al 2006 javaux et al 2008 in a typical drying scenario neglecting precipitation or irrigation events the top soil is earlier depleted because of higher root density and because of dissipation of water potential along the root system ahmed et al 2016 zarebanadkouki et al 2016b 2013 as the upper soil layers dry water uptake shifts to deeper soil regions doussan et al 2006 jarvis 1989 in such conditions roots have been reported to redistribute water from deep wet soil layers to the upper dry soil layers in the process called hydraulic lift hl meunier et al 2017 richards and caldwell 1987 the magnitude of hl depends on biological and environmental variables including atmospheric water demand the root distribution over depth and gradients in soil water potential burgess et al 2001 meinzer et al 2004 domec et al 2012 reported that large volumes of water are transported by deep roots to the top soil if the soil texture allows a large potential gradient to occur hl occurs mainly at night time when transpiration is low and it is reduced by residual water potential gradient generated by plant water storage and nocturnal transpiration huang et al 2017 water supplied by hl can keep fine roots hydrated domec et al 2004 and delay drying of top soil layers brooks et al 2006 therefore sustaining water uptake during drought yu and d odorico 2015 2014 discussed the role of soil drying in hl and showed that hl is determinant for the coexistence of tree and grass on savannas despite these advancements in our understanding of processes controlling hl and the dynamics of root water uptake in drying soils several open questions remain 1 models of hl typically overestimate the rates of hl neumann and cardon 2012 2 models of root water uptake that explicitly simulate water flow in soil and roots doussan et al 2006 javaux et al 2008 require a large number of parameters that are not easily measurable one alternative to detailed root water uptake models e g doussan et al 2006 javaux et al 2008 has been proposed by couvreur et al 2012 who showed that the equivalent soil water potential is the average soil water potential weighed based on the local water fluxes in their model the transpiration rate is equal to the plant conductance multiplied by the xylem collar water potential minus the equivalent soil water potential this simplified approach is an advantage compared to more detailed hydraulic models because it needs fewer parameters however although this simplified model explicitly simulates the water potential in the xylem collar it has not been systematically tested versus measurements of xylem collar potential for varying transpiration rates and soil moisture distribution finally it is not clear whether simplified and detailed models of root water uptake differ in the prediction of hl our working hypothesis is that monitoring xylem water potential and transpiration for varying soil moisture distribution is a key to test models of root water uptake and hl therefore the objectives of this paper were i to measure the relation between leaf xylem water potential and transpiration rates for heterogeneous soil water distributions ii to test the ability of a detailed root water uptake model javaux et al 2008 and of a simplified model couvreur et al 2012 to reproduce the experimental relation between xylem water potential and transpiration rates iii to compare the hl simulated by the detailed and simplified model for the objective i we applied the root pressure chamber method developed by passioura 1980 to lupines lupinus albus l growing in sandy soils with three soil water distributions 1 the upper and lower layers were wet homogeneous water content 2 the upper soil layer was let dry while the lower one was maintained wet heterogeneous water content and 3 both soil layers were let dry homogeneous water content the method was used to monitor the leaf suction for varying transpiration rates and the three degrees of soil water contents 1 3 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil and plant preparation lupines were grown in pvc columns of 30 cm height and 14 cm diameter the pots were filled with quartz sand particle size 500 µm the soil retention curve and the soil hydraulic conductivity of sand were characterized using the extended evaporation method peters and durner

length and 4 cm in diameter was filled with quartz sand at a bulk density of 1 52 g cm 3 soil matric potential at two depths and evaporation rate were recorded during drying at the constant temperature of 25 c the hydraulic parameters were estimated by inversely simulating the measured matric potentials solving the richard s equation the richard s equation was solved in matlab 2016 using a fully implicit euler time discretization and a centred finite difference space discretization scheme celia and binning 1992 soil water retention curve and the hydraulic conductivity curve were parameterized using the pdi model peters durner iden model peters et al 2015 and were inversely adjusted to best reproduce soil water content and matric potentials the soil columns were partitioned into two soil layers separated at a depth of 13 cm by one cm thick layer of fine gravel particle size of 2 3 mm this layer of fine gravel was used to hydraulically disconnect the upper and lower soil layers without hindering root growth so that we could easily impose heterogeneous soil water contents fig 1 a the pots were filled in such a way that the packed soil bulk density was 1 4 g cm 3 several holes with a diameter of 1 5 mm were placed at the bottom and sides of the pots the holes at the bottom allowed water drainage and the holes on sides allowed to inject water using a fine needle the soil surface of each pot was covered with fine gravels from 2 to 3 5 mm to minimize evaporation from the soil surface lupine seeds were germinated on moist filter paper for 24 h and then planted into the pots one seed per pot the plants were grown in a climate room with a photoperiod of 14 h day night temperature of 25 c 22 c and light intensity of 200 µmol m 2 s 1 during the first two weeks the samples were regularly irrigated to maintain the soil water content in both compartments at approximately 25 after the root system grew throughout both compartments the soil water content was adjusted to the following three scenarios i both the top and bottom soil layers were kept at a water content of 15 20 wet wet ii the top compartment was let dry to a water content of 2 5 while the bottom compartment was kept at a water content between 15 20 dry wet and iii both top and bottom compartments were let dry to a water content of 2 5 dry dry the soil moisture was gravimetrically determined every three days by collecting soil samples in each soil layer using a micro auger the soil moisture content was measured at three different heights 4 8 and 12 cm from the bottom in the bottom compartment and at three points 18 22 and 26 cm from the bottom in the top compartment 2 2 root pressure chamber the root pressure chamber method allows measuring the relationship between transpiration rate and the pressure drop across the plant soil continuum the technique is described in detail in passioura 1980 the pvc cylinders filled with soils and the intact and growing roots were enclosed in a pressure chamber with a sealing at the root shoot junction fig 1b the plant shoot remained outside the pressure chamber and was illuminated horizontally by a led lamp varying the distance between led and shoots provided a photosynthetic photon intensity ranging from 98 9 to 1334 µmol m 2 s 1 the photosynthetic photon intensity was changed to impose different transpiration rates transpiration was estimated gravimetrically by weighing the pots between two different time intervals one leaf was cut and the pneumatic pressure in the chamber was increased until a drop of water at a cut leaf fig 1c note that the chamber was pressurized with 99 999 vol n2 the pressure needed to maintain the drop of water at the cut leaf is called balancing pressure pbalancing and it is equal to the suction in the xylem prior to pressurization passioura 1980 plants were imposed to three different transpiration rates by changing the photosynthetic photon intensity and let transpire for 30 min thereafter the balancing pressure and the transpiration rates were measured the root pressure chamber experiments started when the plants were 45 days old the experiments were performed for three scenarios of soil moisture contents wet wet dry wet dry dry and three transpiration rates prior to the experiments the soil moisture in each compartment was determined by collecting soil samples using micro auger through the holes in the pots we measured soil moisture contents in each compartment recorded the transpiration rate g h 1 and the balancing pressure hpa at each light intensity for all replications the time interval between each measurement was 30 min we performed three replications for both uniformly wet and top dry bottom wet and one replication for uniformly dry scenarios 2 3 root collection at the end of each experiment the soil was gently washed away from the roots the roots grown in each compartment were collected and their total root length and radius were measured with the software winrhizo 2008a image analysis system reagent instruments inc canada the root segments were opened on a3 plexiglass tray of the winrhizo flatbed scanner epson std 4800 equipped with a double light source to avoid root overlapping the images were acquired using the twain interface at 800 dpi resolution the root distribution in both compartments is shown in table s1 supplementary data 2 4 simplified model of root water uptake couvreur et al 2012 showed that the relation between transpiration rate q cm3 h 1 collar xylem water potential hx hpa and soil matric potential h s hpa can be written as 1 q k r s h x h s e q where krs is the equivalent conductance cm3 hpa 1 h 1 of the root system and h s eq is an equivalent soil water potential averaged according to the ohm analogy note that hx and h s eq are the sum of the gravitational and hydrostatic potential matric potential for the soil eq 1 predicts that the relation between transpiration rate and the hydraulic gradient is linear and that at no transpiration the leaf water potential is equal to that of the soil i e there is an equilibrium between xylem and soil water eq 1 neglects difference in osmotic potential between xylem and soil the osmotic potential can be added in eq 1 as 2 q k r s h x h s e q σ h x o s m o t i c h s o s m o t i c where h x osmotic and h s osmotic are the osmotic potential hpa in the xylem and soil and σ is the reflection coefficient which is 1 for selective membrane and 0 for non selective membrane neglecting the osmotic potential is equivalent to assume that there is no membrane limiting the transport of solutes from the soil solution to the xylem or that the osmotic potential in the xylem and the soil are equivalent in this study we used eq 1 possible offsets between measured and simulated h s eq could be explained by the osmotic pressure in eq 2 to illustrate the meaning of the parameters krs and h s eq we choose a simplified root system illustrated in fig 2 representing the experimental setup for this set up krs and h s eq are given by 3 k r s 1 k x 1 1 1 k r 1 k s 1 h 1 1 k x 2 k r 2 k s 2 h 1 1 where k r1 k r2 are the radial conductances cm3 hpa 1 h 1 of the roots in the upper and lower soil layers k x1 and k x2 are the axial conductances cm3 hpa 1 h 1 of the roots in the upper and lower soil layers and k s1 h k s2 h are the conductances cm3 hpa 1 h 1 of the soil calculated as nobel and cui 1992 4 k s h 2 π l l n r s o i l r r o o t k h where rsoil is the radius of the soil cylinder rroot is the root radius l is the length of the root segment

and the soil water potential needs to be expressed as centimetre heads 1 hpa 1 cm the equivalent soil water potential is given by 5 h s e q 1 k r 1 k s 1 h 1 1 k r 1 k s 1 h 1 1 k x 2 k r 2 k s 2 h 1

model without osmotic potential eq 1 to fit the measured q p relation 2 5 modelling of water flow into root system the hydraulic tree model of doussan et al 1998 and implemented as in javaux et al 2008 was used to simulate root water uptake the root architecture is represented as a system of interconnected nodes in which water flows radially from the root xylem and longitudinally along the xylem vessels the root system is divided into small segments with uniform length of 5 10 2 cm the radial flow qr cm3 h 1 between the soil root interface and root xylem is 8 q r k r s r h s h x k r h s h x where h s and hx are the water potential at root surface and in the xylem hpa respectively sr is the cross section of root segment cm2 kr is the root radial conductivity cm hpa 1 h 1 and kr is the radial conductance of the segment cm3 hpa 1 h 1 in eq 8 qr is negative when the flow is towards the root i e it is minus the root water uptake the total water potential is the sum of matric potential and the gravitational potential while the osmotic potential is not taken into account this equation does not take into account the dissipation of water potential in the soil therefore to include the conductance of the soil this equation was modified as 9 q r k e f f h s h x where keff is an effective radial conductance of root soil system cm3 hpa 1 h 1 calculated as following 10 1 k e f f 1 1 k s h 1 k r where ks h is an effective soil hydraulic conductance given by 11 k s h 2 π l l n r s o i l r r o o t k h where k h is soil hydraulic conductivity as a function of the matric potential h l is the length of root segment cm here it is assumed that each root with radius rroot has access to a cylindrical region with an outer radius of r s o i l v t o t π l t o t where vtot is the soil volume cm3 and ltot is the total root length cm eq 11 assumes no change in hydraulic conductivity as a function of distance to the root surface and therefore underestimates the gradient in water potential around the roots the axial water flow within each root segment qx cm3 h 1 is described as 12 q x k x l d h x k x d h x d z where hx is water potential in xylem kx is axial conductivity cm4 hpa 1 h 1 hx is xylem hydrostatic potential z is the distance of each segment from the soil surface cm and kx is axial conductivity applying these equations to all nodes of the root system the radial flow of water into each root segment can be described as a system of linear equations the details were descripted in zarebanadkouki et al 2016a b and doussan et al 1998 the model was used to fit the root pressure chamber experiments and to calculate the water uptake in each compartment note that the model can only simulate steady state conditions and no changes in soil water content this assumption is justified by the small time scale of the experiments and the consequent small amount of water removed from the soil samples during the measurements less than 0 1 changes in the water contained in the sample additionally the model does not include the osmotic potential 2 6 model parameterization the linear system of eqs 8 12 was solved in matlab 2016 under fixed soil water potential and transpiration rates which was measured during pressure chamber experiments taken as boundary conditions the soil matric potential was obtained from the soil retention curve and the measured soil water content at three different points in each compartment the soil water potential was assumed to be uniform within each soil layer the soil hydraulic conductivity was estimated using hyprop ums munich germany and assumed to be uniform in each compartment the root architecture was extracted from previous experiments zarebanadkouki et al 2013 the profile of axial and radial conductances was taken from the estimation of zarebanadkouki et al 2016a b these root properties were used as initial guess to fit xylem water potential and to simulate water uptake for all the three soil moisture scenarios wet wet dry wet dry dry after implementation and parameterization of the root architecture model of doussan et al 1998 a forward simulation approach was used to estimate the profile of root water uptake and xylem water potential along the root system of plants growing at different soil water contents and being imposed to different transpiration rates which was measured during pressure chamber experiment given the boundary condition and the transpiration rates the estimated xylem water potential at the collar of the plant was compared with the balancing pressure obtained from the pressure chamber as the osmotic component of water potential in the soil and the xylem was neglected during our modelling approach not known to us the estimated value of balancing pressure would not be comparable to the measured value to compare the measured and estimated value of balancing pressure a constant value was added to the simulated xylem water potential at the collar of the plant this constant is equal to the difference in osmotic potential between the soil surface or a point outside the endodermis and the leaf xylem eq 7 and varied between different scenarios note that as we did not simulate soil water distribution over time the choice of using a different architecture from a quasi 2d container is not critical instead the distribution of radial and axial conductances as well as their absolute values is critical and so is the total root length note also that the total root length in the simulation and in the experiments was similar we started from the root parameters derived by zarebanadkouki et al 2016a b and adapted them to match the experimental results 3 results the fitting of the soil evaporation experiment the water retention curve and hydraulic conductivity are shown in fig 3 the sandy soil was characterized by a steep decrease in water content at a matric potential between 40 and 100 hpa and a corresponding drop in hydraulic conductivity the comprehensive data set of pressure chamber experiments are shown in fig 4 together with the fitting of the simplified model and the root architecture model see also supplementary data table s2 fig 4 shows the relationship between transpiration rate and balancing pressure for the three different scenarios wet wet dry wet dry dry the relationship between transpiration and balancing pressure was linear in all scenarios the slope of the curves which is interpreted as the conductance of the soil root system decreased by a factor of 1 65 from the wet wet to the dry wet treatment in the dry dry treatment the conductance was severely reduced by a factor of 8 26 and the transpiration was also strongly reduced the intercept the balancing pressure at null transpiration decreased from 1040 hpa in the wet wet scenario to ca 1700 hpa in the other two scenarios dry wet and dry dry the linear relation of eq 1 is capable of fitting the measurements the fitting parameters are reported in table 1 let us now discuss the meaning of the parameters krs and h s eq we start with h s eq for the wet soil layer θ 15 20 we expect a soil matric potential of 30 to 50 hpa for the dry soil θ 2 5 we expect a soil matric potential of ca 1000 hpa but because the shape of the water retention curve fig 3 the error in the dry range is expected to be high for the wet wet scenario with both layers at a matric potential 50 hpa eq 1 would give an equivalent soil water potential of 50 hpa which is far from the measured h s eq in table 1 it means that an additional potential of ca 1000 hpa acts on the plant one explanation is that this additional potential is of osmotic nature and could be caused by a difference in osmotic potential between the xylem and a point before the endodermis being it the cortex or the root soil interface as predicted by eq 7 we will discuss this and other explanations in the discussion and conclusions for the dry dry scenario the fitted h s eq is 1700 hpa because the matric potential is highly variable in sand it is possible that the offset of 1000 hpa was still acting in the dry dry soil with the soil matric potential explaining the remaining 700 hpa or that the soil matric potential was 1700 hpa for the dry wet scenario we expect that the soil conductance reduces the importance of h s1 on h s eq in other words we expect that the plant would feel mainly the water potential of the lower soil layer where most of the water is taken up from eq 5 would predict h s eq to be close to the matric potential of the wet lower soil layers however because of the uncertainties in the offset the claimed osmotic potential would be difficult to make a conclusive statement indeed it could be that the offset becomes more negative or that the soil matric potential in the upper layer was much more negative than 1000 hpa in summary from the analysis of h s eq it results that the h s eq becomes more negative as the soil dries out as expected however the value of h s eq seems to be more negative than the one expected particularly in wet soils the origin of such deviation is probably of osmotic nature originating from a difference in osmotic potential between the xylem and the root surface the latter being at more negative osmotic potential than the xylem as given by eq 7 other explanations are discussed later in the discussion and conclusions the plant conductances krs were analyzed according to eqs 3 and 4 the simplified model is capable to describe the measured krs taking a reasonable soil conductivity of k 10 5 cm s 1 for the wet layers and k 3 10 11 cm s 1 for the dry ones based on fig 3 and inversely estimating the radial and axial conductances of the simplified root system shown in fig 2 gives a good match of the measured krs without additional assumptions the obtained conductances are shown in table 2 in the wet soil layers the soil conductance 36 cm3 h 1 hpa 1 was much higher than the radial root conductance 7 20 10 4 but in dry soils the soil conductance was much lower 1 08 10 4 this explains the reduction of krs in dry soil layers in summary the simplified model is capable of reproducing the relation between leaf suction and transpiration for varying soil moistures and the soil and root conductances to explain such behaviour are physically sound note that the objective of these calculations was not to determine the conductances of the different root segments but rather to test whether eq 3 could be used to reproduce the relation between leaf suction and transpiration with physically sound parameters this was the case for the conductances but not for the equivalent soil water potential particularly in drying soils once these conductances are estimated they can be used to predict the local water uptakes in each scenario table 3 the more complex architecture model based on the parameterization of zarebanadkouki et al 2016a b was capable to reproduce the measurements provided that the simulated xylem water potential at the plant collar was reduced by 1000 hpa as for the simplified model this value can be interpreted as the osmotic potential difference between the xylem and a point outside the endodermis for all curves the relation between transpiration rate and leaf suction was linear the intercept of the line with x axis indicates the equivalent soil water potential experienced by the plant note that the root distribution in each compartment was equal i e 50 the root architecture model provides the water potential in the root system fig 5 shows the distribution at medium light intensity when the soil was uniformly wet the root system felt almost the same water potential in both compartments and there was a little dissipation of water potential along the root system particularly along the tap root in the dry wet scenario fig 5b the roots in the upper dry compartment were at much more negative water potential than the roots in the lower wet compartment interestingly the tips of the roots in the upper dry compartment were at a more negative potential than the corresponding more proximal segments indicating water efflux from the root tips in the dry dry soils the root system was at a more negative but rather uniform water potential with similar gradients from the tips of the lateral roots to the tap root the model also yields the profile of the radial fluxes m s 1 into the roots fig 6 in wet wet soil fig 6a the contribution of radial flux was rather uniform along the root system indicating a moderate dissipation of water potential along the depth in dry wet soil fig 6b the uptake in upper dry soil was much smaller compared to that in the lower wet layer in the dry dry scenario the water fluxes were strongly reduced in both soil layers this detailed root hydraulic architecture gives the relative water uptake in the upper and lower soil layers for each scenario in homogeneous soil water content scenarios wet wet dry dry water uptake was slightly higher in the upper compartment than in the lower despite the root length being imposed to be 50 50 table 4 this was caused by the dissipation of water potential along the roots in the dry dry condition the relative uptake in the upper and lower soil layers was almost the same as in the wet wet conditions the reason was that the difference in water potential between soil and root was larger compared to dissipation along the root in both conditions wet wet dry dry there was no effect of varying transpiration on the relative water uptake when the soil water content was not uniform dry wet the relative water uptake changed with varying transpiration rates at high transpiration rates water was taken up from the wet soil and it was released by the roots in the upper compartment the process referred to as hydraulic lift at decreasing transpiration rates hydraulic lift increased significantly the main difference between the two models is in the hydraulic lift which is higher in the root architecture model 4 discussion and conclusions we showed that the relation between leaf water potential and transpiration rate was linear at both uniform and heterogeneous water contents distribution and it could be well fitted with both a simple model couvreur et al 2012 and a detailed root architecture model of water uptake at uniform soil moisture distribution either being wet wet or dry dry scenario the relative root water uptake depended uniquely on the root properties and its distribution along the root system did not vary with transpiration rate in the dry wet scenarios root water uptake is predicted to shift to the lower and wet layer and both models predicted the occurrence of hydraulic lift in the upper dry soil layer the slope of the transpiration rate versus balancing pressure which is interpreted as the soil plant conductance decreased by a factor of 8 26 in the dry dry scenario as compared to the wet wet scenario indicating the limiting role of the soil conductivity on root water uptake in contrast to the measurements by passioura 1980 and carminati et al 2017 we found a linear relation between transpiration and balancing pressure also in dry soil however it is likely that in the present study we did not reach transpiration rates high enough to observe the deviations from the linear relationship and the consequent hysteric behaviour reported in the studies above similarly to carminati et al 2017 we found an offset in the balancing pressure which we interpreted as the effect of the difference in osmotic potential between the xylem and the soil eqs 2 and 7 osmotic potential of ca 0 1 mpa are reported in the classic work by fiscus 1977 and are consistent with our interpretations another explanation of the offset is that at low flow rates i e q 0 the relation between transpiration and leaf xylem water potential is not linear this could be caused by capacitance effects with the plant tissues being slowly rehydrated the models employed here did not include plant capacitance and although we could argue that for young lupines plant capacitance should not play a big role we cannot conclude that the model simplification introduced some error at low flow rates another explanation is that roots extracted water from a small soil volume which could have become significantly drier than the bulk soil however such moisture gradients are not expected in wet soils as in the wet wet scenario and should have quickly disappeared when the upper soil layer was dry the soil plant conductance decreased by a factor of 1 65 compared to wet wet scenario both the simplified and the architecture models were capable to reproduce the results the parameterization based on the data from zarebanadkouki et al 2016a b well fitted the data without any need to adjust the parameters this might be a coincidence as the plants in this study were 2 weeks older possibly the fact that here the conductance of the shoot from the collar to the cut leaf is not included can explain the quality of the fit it could be that the actual root conductance of this study was slightly higher than that in zarebanadkouki et al 2016a b and neglecting the shoot conductance resulted in this good fit the simulations predicted that the location of water uptake shifted to the lower soil region while a significant amount of water taken up by the roots in the wet region was released from the root tips into the upper dry soil layer in the process referred to as hydraulic lift caldwell et al 1998 richards and caldwell 1987 hl is known to increase at low transpiration rates at low transpiration rates the root architecture model predicted a hydraulic lift corresponding to ca 28 of the transpiration 0 49 mm water day 1 which is within the range in the literature neumann and cardon 2012 scott et al 2008 yu and d odorico 2014 interestingly the architecture model predicts hydraulic lift also at high transpiration rates and not just when transpiration is low the impacts of hydraulic lift on ecohydrological and soil processes are manifold it supports shallow rooted competitors dawson 1993 hawkins et al 2009 moreira et al 2003 yu and d odorico 2015 it maintains root in contact with drying soil bauerle et al 2008 domec et al 2004 and it stimulates microbial activity lehto and zwiazek 2011 wang et al 2009 hydraulic lift also alters the profiles of soil moisture and impacts carbon assimilation canopy transpiration and the water use efficiency during dry season amenu and kumar 2008 manoli et al 2017 also showed that hydraulic redistribution produced by deep rooted trees enhances ecosystem resilience to drought and maintains photosynthesis in shallow rooted trees in summary this study shows the potential of combining the root pressure chamber method which allows for monitoring the average leaf suction in intact transpiring plants exposed to soil drying with hydraulics model of water uptake both root water uptake models were capable to reproduce the measured relationship between transpiration and leaf water potential however the models differ in the prediction of hydraulic lift the detailed architecture model allows for assigning variable hydraulic conductivities to different root segments according to parameterization by zarebanadkouki et al 2016a b the root tips were the most radially conductive regions and these are the locations where hydraulic lift takes place the simplified model summarizes all the different root conductivities in effective terms and predicts less hydraulic lift from this comparison between the models we conclude that a simplified model is sufficient to describe the relationship between leaf water potential and transpiration but a more detailed model is needed to understand the mechanisms impacting hydraulic lift concerning hydraulic lift we cannot conclude on which model is better because we have not measured hydraulic lift however the more detailed model is more adequate to calculate water potential gradients and fluxes along the root system such a model should be used to test open questions such as the potential mechanisms plants employ to control hydraulic lift for instance root exudation of mucilage induces water repellency in the rhizosphere and it is likely to reduce water fluxes zarebanadkouki et al 2016a similarly root shrinkage and the consequent loss of contacts between soil and roots carminati et al 2013 will reduce the leakage of water from the roots since it is known that current models overestimate hl neumann and cardon 2012 including such dynamic processes at the root soil interface into existing models would be interesting in this case the water flow into and from the root should account for soil capacitance and its hysteresis which was not done in the present study where radial flow to the roots was solved assuming steady state conditions in analogy with what has been done for plant tissues it could be found that rhizosphere capacitances decrease modelled hl huang et al 2017 dynamic processes at the root soil interface and their impact on hydraulic lift deserve further studies and would require high spatial resolution measurements of water fluxes along the root system optimally such studies would allow for a better understanding of how root soil interactions impact water fluxes at day and night acknowledgment
