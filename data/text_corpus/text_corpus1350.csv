6750,water quality and quantity data are essential for water resources management but historical records are not always available at sites where information is required especially for water quality wq data because of the high costs of implementing and operating water quality monitoring networks this leads to the impossibility impracticality of monitoring all streams watersheds in a region under monitoring a novel statistical approach is proposed for the estimation of wq characteristics 25th 50th and 75th percentiles at ungauged streams watersheds the proposed approach is based on developing a wq causes effects functional relationship which has not been done before the wq causes are represented by the watershed physiographic natural and anthropogenic attributes and the effects are represented by the wq characteristics for a target ungauged stream watershed i a canonical correlation analysis based neighborhood approach was applied to identify homogeneous gauged watersheds and ii nonlinear regression models were then calibrated using data available at the selected gauged watersheds to develop the causes effects functional relationship between the physiographic attributes as predictors and wq characteristics as dependent variables once the regression models were validated the physiographic characteristics of the target ungauged stream watershed were used to estimate its wq characteristics the jack knife validation method was applied to evaluate the proposed statistical approach using 50 gauged streams from the nile delta of egypt results showed accurate and precise estimation of the electric conductivity and sodium percentiles for iron relatively less precision was obtained due to the absence of attributes that can describe the iron concentrations keywords water quality neighborhood approach ungauged sites nile delta 1 introduction full understanding of different anthropogenic and natural processes that may affect water quality and quantity is very important for sustainable water resources management khalil and ouarda 2009 one of the main objectives of water quality monitoring programs is to help explain various water quality wq processes in addition wq monitoring programs provide water managers with essential data information for wq management however as it requires sufficient instrumentation equipment adequate funding and specialized personnel wq monitoring is a costly undertaking particularly in developing countries thus in most cases water quality monitoring networks wqmns are characterized by low density and inadequate distribution khalil et al 2011a even in cases of well designed wqmns with adequate spatial distribution it is often very expensive and impractical to cover all the streams watersheds in a particular region under monitoring consequently historical wq data may not always be available at sites where information is required for water quantity a lot of research has been published on the estimation of flood quantiles at ungauged or insufficiently gauged streams watersheds e g burn 1988 1990 1997 shu and burn 2004 cunderlik and burn 2002 2003 2006a b shu and ouarda 2007 chebana and ouarda 2007 2008 2009 chebana et al 2012 wazneh et al 2013 o brien and burn 2014 wang et al 2014 sun et al 2015 ahn et al 2017 as well as for the estimation of detailed water quantity records at ungauged streams watersheds

of this research on estimating flood quantiles at ungauged streams watersheds was based on empirical statistical approaches that use available hydrological meteorological and physiographic data in these studies the idea was to use information available at gauged streams watersheds to build a relationship between watershed meteorological physiographic attributes e g catchment area slope stream length on the one hand and hydrological characteristics e g flood quantiles on the other hand once the statistical approach is calibrated and validated one can use the meteorological physiographic attributes of the target ungauged stream watershed to estimate its hydrological characteristics of interest unlike the estimation of flood quantiles at ungauged streams watersheds the estimation of wq characteristics at ungauged streams watersheds is described by tens of wq indicators e g chemical physical and biological indicators and not only the streamflow and it is affected by anthropogenic factors agricultural industrial and domestic wastes more than the catchment attributes e g area slope in general water quality monitoring objectives can be summarized as follows whitfield 1988 harmancioglu et al 1992 i to assess wq trends ii to assess the influence of natural and anthropogenic attributes on the general trends in wq processes iii to assess the effectiveness of different measures for water pollution control and iv to assess the level of compliance with wq standards in addition wq data generated from wqmns are also used to assess general wq status over a region compute wq indices and to calibrate and validate wq models as well khalil et al 2011a showed that it is also possible to use wq data generated from gauged streams watersheds and their watersheds attributes to estimate wq characteristics at ungauged streams watersheds there are many conceptual numerical wq models available for the assessment of wq status using mathematical equations that describe the advection dispersion processes of conservative pollutants as well as transformation processes for non conservative pollutants e g water quality analysis simulation program wasp hydrologic simulation program fortran hspf proposed by the united states environmental protection agency usepa and mike11 proposed by the danish hydraulic institute dhi however due to the extensive calculation time required conceptual models remain limited to small watersheds khalil et al 2015 keupers and willems 2017 for example for a belgian catchment of approximately 40 000 ha mike11 took around four days to simulate only one year of data using an up to date computer keupers and willems 2017 another study which modeled the neuse river estuary using ce qual w2 took 2000 model runs to assess the uncertainty associated with only 7 parameters out of the 115 model parameters and it would take 1054 model runs to test the full 115 parameters bowen and hieronymus 2000 2003 lobuglio et al 2007 in addition to incorporate more details in the conceptual models conceptual models are normally developed using different software programs linking these programs is technically very difficult and time consuming keupers and willems 2017 recently keupers and willems 2017 proposed a rapid conceptual wq model by dividing the stream under monitoring into conceptual reservoirs which were modeled as plug flow reactors pfr and continuously stirred tank reactors cstr to simulate the spatial and temporal evolution of wq in the stream this newly developed conceptual model can provide accurate and precise results much more rapidly than conventional conceptual models however for the estimation of wq characteristics at ungauged streams watersheds it would be very difficult impossible to calibrate and validate such models due to the absence of data however data driven empirical models have found appeal because of their rapid development minimum required information accuracy and simplicity akkoyunlu and akiner 2010 khalil et al 2015 very limited research has been conducted for the estimation of wq status at ungauged streams watersheds recently researchers have sought to integrate wq monitoring data and wq models to derive wq information at ungauged watersheds or to improve uncertainty at gauged sites for example lobuglio et al 2007 proposed using bayesian maximum entropy bme to integrate wq monitoring data and modeling results to reduce uncertainty at gauged sites more recently khalil et al 2011a proposed integrating wq monitoring data and watersheds attributes in artificial intelligence models to derive information about wq at completely ungauged watersheds khalil et al 2011a proposed artificial neural network ann ensemble ann eann and canonical correlation analysis cca based eann cca eann models for the estimation of wq mean values at ungauged streams watersheds the ann and eann models were developed to calibrate the relationship between watershed physiographic characteristics as predictors and wq mean values as dependent variables as for the cca eann model the cca was employed to create a canonical physiographic space using wq data and physiographic attributes from gauged streams watersheds and the eann was then developed to calibrate and validate the relationships between the physiographic attributes in the canonical space as predictors and wq mean values as dependent variables to the best of the authors knowledge this is the only study that attempts to propose empirical statistical models for the estimation of wq characteristics at ungauged streams watersheds in this study a novel statistical approach is proposed for the estimation of not only the wq mean values but also the low and high percentiles at target ungauged streams watersheds which has not been done before in addition the proposed approach involves applying a neighborhood approach before developing the causes effects functional relationship to improve the accuracy and precision of the estimated wq characteristics 2 study area and available data egypt is a semi arid country where rainfall occurs mainly along its north coast ranging from 150 mm year to 200 mm year khalil et al 2011a away from the north coast the rain intensity decreases dramatically to scattered showers in middle egypt and rarely occurs in upper egypt the nile river is the main source of fresh water and represents about 97 of egyptian water resources khalil et al 2011a in egypt the per capita share of freshwater resources is already under the water poverty level 1000 m3 per person per year and it is expected to drop dramatically to around 450 m3 person year by the year 2025 abdel gawad et al 2004 to stretch their limited water resources the ministry of water resources and irrigation mwri has applied a water reuse strategy mainly in the nile delta the reuse strategy applied in the nile delta is based on pumping agricultural drainage water into irrigation canals at 21 sites known as mixing points or reuse sites to augment the freshwater supply dri 1998 the nile delta total area is about 1 9 million hectares while the cultivated area is 1 6 million hectares khalil et al 2011a the nile delta is dominated by agricultural activities with some scattered industrial activities and residential areas the nile delta agricultural drainage system consists of 22 main drainage catchments wq monitoring programs for the nile delta drainage system started in 1977 and have been operated by the national water research center nwrc of the mwri at that time the nile delta drainage system wqmn was designed mainly to assess the water reuse strategy by monitoring the drainage water quantity and limited wq variables that are principally related to water salinity after 20 years in 1997 the nwrc expanded the nile delta drainage system wqmn to cover 94 sampling sites where 33 wq indicators are measured on a monthly basis the design of the expanded wq monitoring program was based on a set of wq objectives i to assess compliance with wq standards ii to assess mass transport and iii to assess temporal and spatial trends nawqam 2001 out of the 94 sampling sites 21 sites were selected at the points where agricultural drainage water is mixed with irrigation fresh water to design evaluate the rates of mixing ten sites were selected in the main drains to assess water and salt balance thirteen sites were selected at the main drains outfalls to the mediterranean and northern lakes fifty sites were selected at drainage branches that serve small drainage catchments units and convey their drainage water to the main drains fig 1 the nile delta is divided into 94 drainage catchments units the drainage catchment unit is an area served by a branch drain that is drained by only one point on the main drain called the outfall of the branch drain as explained in khalil et al 2011a and applied in this study for any of the gauged drainage catchments units physiographic attributes represent the causes while the quality of the drainage water measured at the outfall of its branch drain describes the effects of the physiographic attributes on the wq status for each of the 94 nile delta drainage units a set of physiographic attributes that represents mainly agricultural activities as well as industrial and domestic influences was identified as follows cultivated area ha was considered by khalil et al 2011a instead of the total area because it is more representative than the total area with respect to the drainage wq average soil salinity ppm represents the salinity of the media where the drainage water passes to the field subsurface drains and then to the branch drains average soil hydraulic conductivity m d represents the ease with which the drainage water can pass through soil to the subsurface pipes and also represents the soil permeability and structure average total annual rainfall mm year represents meteorological factors that may have direct and indirect influences on the quality of drainage water in the streams drainage system total length km represents the longest distance that the drop of water travels to the branch drain outfall average total industrial effluents m3 day represents industrial effluents wastewater plant total capacity m3 day represents domestic effluents number of livestock represents animal wastes and total annual applied fertilizers tons year represents fertilizers agricultural influences it should be emphasized that the population data within each drainage catchment would be a very useful attribute but it was difficult to obtain population records at the level of drainage units in the nile delta population records are available only at the level of administrative divisions e g governorates similarly the quality of the irrigation water used at each drainage unit catchment would be useful to include in the list of attributes causes however information about the quality of the irrigation water is available at only 32 out of the 50 gauged drainage units in addition information about the quality of the wwtp and industrial effluents would be more useful than using the wwtp total capacity or the average total industrial effluents however there is no information available about the quality of the wwtp and industrial effluents table 1 provides the descriptive statistics of the identified attributes the proposed statistical approach explained in the following section is based on using stationary wq variables which did not show any trends in terms of annual characteristics the wq database of the nile delta drainage system was examined for stationarity using the kendall test kendall 1975 results showed that most of the wq variables measured in the nile delta wqmn are nonstationary the nonstationary characteristics of the wq variables may stem from for example frequently changing cropping patterns that shift based on farmer preferences these fluctuating practices often result in changes in fertilizer usage that may contribute to different patterns of nitrate residuals in the drains another possible source of the dynamic nature of the wq variables is the expansion of residential sewer systems in the region this could promote some negative trends in the fecal and total coliform levels in the drains as well as in other wq variables e g biochemical oxygen demand chemical oxygen demand and nitrates few wq variables showed stationary patterns including electric conductivity ec iron fe lead pb zinc zn sodium na magnesium mg ph and chloride cl these variables can be divided into major ions or salinity related variables ec mg na and cl and heavy metals related variables fe zn and pb in this study three wq indicators were selected to examine the proposed approach fe as representative of heavy metals and ec and na as representative of salinity and major ions for the selected wq variables results showed that at all of the 50 gauged drainage units the null hypothesis that there is no trend in the annual characteristics can be accepted at 0 05 significance level 3 methodology the proposed statistical approach is based on developing a functional relationship between the drainage unit attributes as predictors and selected wq characteristics as dependent variables by using information available at gauged drainage units once this functional relationship is calibrated and validated one may use the attributes of the target ungauged unit to estimate its wq characteristics one can use statistical techniques e g multiple regression or artificial intelligence techniques e g artificial neural network to estimate the wq characteristics e g ec 75th percentiles as dependent variables using drainage unit attributes e g cultivated area fertilizers applied and rainfall as predictors however due to the high levels of heterogeneity among the gauged drainage units using such techniques may not provide accurate and precise results unless a high level of homogeneity exists thus the neighborhood approach is proposed as a preliminary step before the development of the causes effects functional relationship the main goal of the neighborhood approach is to select only the drainage units that are similar to the target ungauged unit to avoid high levels of heterogeneity for instance instead of using all the available 50 gauged drainage units with a high level of heterogeneity the neighborhood approach ensures the selection of a subset of these 50 gauged units that are relatively homogeneous and similar to the target ungauged unit thus the proposed statistical approach consists of two main components i the neighborhood approach to select homogeneous gauged drainage units for each target ungauged unit and ii the development of the causes effects relationship for this specific target ungauged unit using information available at the selected homogeneous gauged units the two components of the statistical approach are carried out in four steps as follows the first step is to prepare data sets of i the required wq characteristics at gauged drainage units 25th percentile 50th percentile and 75th percentile and ii the drainage unit attributes as explained in the study area section in the second step the neighborhood approach is used for each target ungauged drainage unit to identify a set of similar gauged units the third step consists of estimating the regression model parameters for each of the required wq characteristics at each of the target ungauged drainage units using information available at neighbor gauged units that were selected in the previous step the fourth step is to apply the calibrated regression models using the attributes of the target ungauged drainage unit to estimate its wq characteristics it should be emphasized that a regression model will be developed for each wq characteristic at each ungauged drainage unit 3 1 estimation of wq characteristics at gauged drainage units the estimation of the wq characteristics at gauged drainage units consists of three steps i identify the best statistical model for each wq variable at each of the gauged drainage units ii construct the cumulative distribution function cdf based on the identified model statistical distribution and iii estimate the selected percentiles based on the constructed cdf in the first step each of the selected wq variables ec na and fe at each of the 50 gauged drainage units was examined for 10 different statistical distributions i normal ii inverse gaussian iii log normal iv log logistic v logistic vi exponential vii gamma viii generalized pareto ix weibull and x t distribution in this step for each wq variable at each gauged drainage unit the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 and the small sample aic aicc developed by hurvich and tsai 1995 and bayesian information criterion bic schwarz 1978 were used to identify the best statistical distribution which are defined as follows 1 bic ln n s 2 ln l 2 aic 2 s 2 ln l 3 aicc a i c 2 s s 1 n s 1 where s is the number of estimated parameters l is the maximum value of the likelihood function for the model and nis the sample size based on the best statistical model identified by bic aic and aicc a cdf was constructed and selected percentiles 25th 50th and 75th percentiles were then identified based on the constructed cdf it should be emphasized that the nature of wq data may include missing values outliers extreme values or that the data series may not be long enough to accurately represent the statistical distribution in this case non parametric approaches are preferable to identify wq characteristics at gauged sites e g shu and ouarda 2012 however in our case for the three selected wq variables the data set was complete and no outliers were observed thus the parametric approach described above was employed 3 2 the neighborhood approach in regional flood frequency analysis it has been shown that identifying gauged watersheds that are hydrologically similar to the target ungauged watershed provides more accurate and precise results than using all the available gauged watersheds for regional estimation grehys 1996a b different approaches have been proposed for the identification of similar gauged watersheds e g geographical regions homogeneous regions neighborhood approach grehys 1996a b compared four different approaches for the delineation of hydrologically homogeneous regions or neighborhoods with seven different regional estimation techniques their results showed that the cca based neighborhood approach provided good results with any of the seven estimation techniques in addition they concluded that the neighborhood approach is better than approaches based on fixed regions e g geographical regions for each target ungauged drainage unit the neighborhood approach aims to identify similar gauged drainage units similar characteristics from which one can transfer information to the target ungauged unit cavadias 1989 1990 1995 and ribeiro correa et al 1995 proposed the cca for the identification of hydrologically homogeneous regions given that different anthropogenic and natural factors may affect the quality of water which is attributed to various water quality indicators the cca is an ideal technique to evaluate this causes effects relationship the cca can explain the linear relationship between two sets of variables shu and ouarda 2007 in this study the cca is employed to evaluate the linear relationship between different wq characteristics on the one hand and different drainage unit attributes on the other in the current research the neighborhood cca based approach was adapted for the identification of gauged drainage units that are similar to the target ungauged drainage unit as explained in the following subsections 3 2 1 development of the canonical space assume that x x 1 x 2 x n is the matrix of physiographic attributes and y y 1 y 2 y m is the matrix of wq characteristics 25th 50th and75th percentile where n is the size of physiographic attributes considered and m is the size of wq indicators while n m assume any linear combination u of x 1 x 2 x n and v of y 1 y 2 y m where u and v are the canonical variables muirhead 1982 4 u a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 a n x n a x 5 v b 1 y 1 b 2 y 2 b m y m b y where a and b represent the canonical coefficients and a and b representthe transposes of vectors a and b respectively in this study several scenarios were examined including all the attributes as well as all the nine wq characteristics 25th 50th and 75th percentiles for each of fe na and ec or including only a selected subset of the wq attributes and three percentiles only either the same percentile for each of the three wq variables or the three percentiles for each wq variable preliminary analysis showed that the canonical space was significantly affected by the selection of the set of x and the set of y it was observed that it was better to select the attributes that significantly affect the selected wq variables for instance for the ec or na percentiles the cultivated area soil salinity soil hydraulic conductivity drain length and rainfall were the most significant attributes to be included in the x matrix it was decided that the best way to proceed was to have a y matrix including only the percentiles of one wq variable while the x matrix includes only attributes that affect this wq variable including all of the available drainage unit attributes would add some noise because of the absence of a relationship between the attributes in x and wq characteristics in y it should be emphasized that the causes effects relationship may change from one region to the other the canonical correlation matrix r shows the correlation between u and v and r d is the matrix of diagonal r the diagonal shows the correlation coefficients between each pair of the canonical variables u 1 and v 1 u 2 and v 2 u m and v m ribeiro correa et al 1995 6 r d r 1 0 0 0 0 r 2 0 0 0 0 r i 0 0 0 0 r m the canonical space created using v 1 and v 2 was then employed to identify neighbors for each target ungauged drainage unit to project the attributes of the target ungauged unit into the canonical space the canonical coefficients and r d were used as follows ribeiro correa et al 1995 7 u ug a x ug 8 v ug u ug r d where x ug is the vector of physiographic attributes at the target ungauged unit and u ug and v ug are the canonical variables at the target ungauged unit the r d and v ug were then used to identify the gauged neighbors as explained in the following sub section 3 2 2 neighborhood identification three steps were followed to identify the neighbors of each target ungauged unit first the ungauged unit was identified in the canonical space by defining its canonical variable v ug as explained in the previous sub section the mean position of the target ungauged unit in the canonical space was estimated by v ug second the vector of distances d between the target ungauged unit and each of the gauged units was determined using the mahalanobis distance mahalanobis 1936 as explained by ribeiro correa et al 1995 9 d v g v ug i r d 2 t 1 v g v ug t where i represents the identity matrix and v g represents the canonical variable for the set of gauged drainage units third the neighbor gauged units were identified based on the vector d a critical distance was used to compare the distances between the target ungauged drainage unit and each of the gauged drainage units if the distance to a gauged unit was less than or equal to the critical distance then this gauged unit was considered one of the neighbors to the target unit i e has similar physiographic characteristics the critical distance is selected from x 2 tabulated values based on the degrees of freedom which is equal to the number of dependent variables i e the size of y and a significance level which are adjusted during the calibration process for each target ungauged unit the confidence level 1 was defined as the set of drainage units for which the position v g in the canonical space meets the following constraint ribeiro correa et al 1995 ouarda et al 2001 10 v g v ug i r d 2 t 1 v g v ug t x p 2 where x p 2 is such that p x 2 x p 2 1 this equation represents the contour of an ellipsoid centered at v ug for each target ungauged unit after identifying its neighbor gauged units wq and physiographic characteristics from its neighbor gauged drainage units were used to calibrate the regression model for the target ungauged unit as explained in the following sub section the value of strongly influences the size of the ellipsoid and consequently the number of gauged drainage units considered as neighbors to the target ungauged unit as well as the degree of homogeneity among the selected neighbors the value of ranges between zero including all the gauged units and one no neighbors thus the value should be less than one and bigger than or equal zero considering a small value of large confidence level 1 guaranties including a larger number of neighbors than considering a large value of that guaranties selecting only very close neighbors fig 2 shows the influence of the value of on the size of the ellipsoid using a large value of small number of neighbors guaranties high levels of homogeneity since only the closest gauged units are included however with a small value of a relatively larger number of neighbors will be included which may be associated with lower levels of homogeneity although a higher level of homogeneity is guaranteed with a small number of neighbors it may be difficult to use this relatively small number of neighbors to calibrate and validate the regression model in the following step on the other hand a larger number of neighbors guaranties calibrating and validating the regression model but may introduce outliers higher level of heterogeneity explained by including gauged drainage units that are not similar to the target ungauged unit to identify the optimal number of gauged neighbors to consider for each target ungauged drainage unit different values for were considered various confidence levels 1 100 and the selection of the best confidence level was based on the accuracy and precision of the estimated wq percentiles the main task in this step was to find the optimal set of gauged units that provided the most accurate and precise estimation of the wq characteristics thus regression performance measures as described in the following subsections were used to identify the desired optimal set 3 3 regression analysis nonlinear multiple regression analysis was performed using data from the neighbor gauged drainage units the multiple regression technique was selected because it is simple and rapid to apply in addition it allows for the use of different statistical distributions in each of the gauged drainage units and is less sensitive than other techniques to the expected heterogeneity that may occur within the selected neighbors ouarda et al 2000 in general the power form function is commonly applied in regional flood frequency analysis ouarda et al 2000 shu and ouarda 2007 however the power form introduces additional bias due to the log transformation as explained by stedinger and tasker 1985 1986 in this study preliminary trials indicated that the nonlinear form provided better results than the power form with respect to the accuracy and precision of the estimated wq characteristics and provided much better results than the linear form as such the nonlinear form was applied in this study regression models were developed to estimate wq characteristics y using physiographic attributes x as predictors the calibrated and validated regression models were then used to estimate wq characteristics at the target ungauged drainage unit using its attributes xug as follows helsel and hirsch 2002 11 y β 0 β 1 x u g 1 β 2 x u g 2 β n x u g n ε where y is the dependent variable wq characteristics β 0 represents the regression intercept β 1 to β n represent the predictors coefficients x ug1 to x ugn represent the drainage unit attributes and ε is a random error different forms of the drainage unit attributes were considered in the nonlinear regression including all possible interactions and squared and cubic forms to identify the optimal set of predictors among all these possible linear and nonlinear predictors the stepwise forward selection approach was applied the nonlinear stepwise regression was recommended in this study given the large number of attributes that can contribute in a linear or non linear way to the estimation of the wq percentiles the stepwise forward selection approach consists of testing each predictor to be added to the regression model to check if is statistically significant one continues to examine each predictor until there are no additional improvements the ordinary least squares method was applied to estimate the regression parameters β 0 and β 1 to β n stedinger and tasker 1985 1986 fig 3 shows the flow chart for the proposed approach it should be emphasized that a separate regression model is presented for each wq characteristic at each ungauged drainage unit one of the main differences between the approach proposed by khalil et al 2011a b and that proposed in the current study is the use of the cca where khalil et al 2011a b used the cca for data pre processing in the current study the cca is used as a filter to identify gauged units that are similar to the target ungauged unit in both approaches nonlinear models were applied this is mainly due to the nonlinear nature of the wq causes effects relationships in khalil et al 2011a b artificial neural network ann models were calibrated and validated using all of the available gauged units while in the current study nonlinear stepwise regression models were applied the ann models may be preferable for use with a large data set while regression may be better suited to limited data sets nonlinear stepwise regression may be preferable because it can be applied to easily and simply select the optimal set of predictors among different possible linear and nonlinear forms of the drainage unit attributes in addition weights associated with each selected predictor provide a direct explanation of the contribution or the influence of this predictor on the target characteristic finally the approach proposed by khalil et al 2011a b was mainly used for the estimation of the wq central tendency however in this study the proposed approach was applied for the estimation of the wq central tendency represented by the 50th percentile and the dispersion represented by the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles 3 4 evaluation procedures the jack knife sampling procedure was employed to evaluate the proposed statistical approach in the jack knife procedure each of the 50 gauged drainage units was considered as the target ungauged unit while the remaining 49 gauged drainage units were used for the development of the canonical space various neighborhood sizes were then identified for the target drainage unit each related to a specific value as explained in the neighborhood identification section the proposed approach was evaluated using three metrics the relative bias rbias as a measure of accuracy the relative root mean square error rrmse as a measure of precision and the nash sutcliffe coefficient nsc as a measure of the model s overall performance nash and sutcliffe 1970 which are defined as follows 12 rbias 1 n i 1 n y i y i y i 13 rrmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i y i 2 1 2 14 nsc 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where n is the sample size 50 drainage units y is the wq characteristic mean value over n and y i and y i for i 1 n are the observed and estimated wq characteristic values respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 estimation of wq characteristics at gauged sites each of the selected wq variables ec na and fe at each of the 50 gauged drainage units was examined for ten different statistical distributions as explained in the methodology section the bic aic and aicc were used to identify the best statistical model as shown in table 2 table 2 showed the values of the bic aic and aicc for the ec measured at one of the gauged drainage units in western delta wq sampling site located at qusur drain outfall to the edko main drain we10 results indicated that the ec values measured at we10 followed the normal distribution with the smallest bic aic and aicc values for the ec values measured at the we10 the statistical moments were identified as follows 3 8637 the location mean value and 0 7342 the scale standard deviation knowing the data distribution e g normal distribution and the related statistical moments e g the location and scale different non exceedance percentiles were identified based on the cumulative distribution function as shown in fig 4 the selected characteristics of the ec were then identified as follows 25th percentile was 3 3686 50th percentile was 3 8637 and 75th percentilewas 4 3589 similarly the three selected percentiles were identified for each of the selected wq variables at each of the 50 gauged drainage units 4 2 neighborhood approach as explained in the methodology section unlike the estimation of flood quantiles at ungauged watersheds the estimation of wq percentiles at ungauged watersheds is described by tens of wq indicators in addition the watershed attributes included in most of the flood quantile studies are limited to the natural e g precipitation and watershed attributes e g total area general slope stream length but for the estimation of wq percentiles several anthropogenic attributes should be included the selection of the watershed attributes for the estimation of wq percentiles can be based on a wq causes effects relationship for the selection of the set of attributes to include for the estimation of each of the selected wq variables preliminary analysis was conducted as explained in the methodology section preliminary analysis based on trial and error indicated that the following attributes should be included for the estimation of the ec and na percentiles cultivated area soil salinity soil hydraulic conductivity rain fall and drain length these attributes were the best to use for both the development of the canonical space as well as for the estimation step using the nonlinear regression models for fe the following attributes were included for the development of the canonical space as well as for the regression models cultivated area hydraulic conductivity rainfall and fertilizers it was expected that attributes such as the average industrial effluents or the wwtps capacity would be good for the estimation of the fe characteristics however because not all the drainage units are exposed to industrial activities and some of these units have no sewage services and wwtps these two attributes included some zeros zero industrial effluents for non industrial units and zero for the capacity of wwtps at units without wwtps statistically speaking these zeroes affect the level of association with the fe percentiles watershed attributes that can be more useful representative for the estimation of fe percentiles may include i fe concentrations in the wwtp effluents ii fe concentrations in the industrial effluents and iii fe concentrations in the irrigation water the fe concentrations in the wwtp and industrial effluents as well as in the irrigation water are more representative and useful as attributes than the quantity of industrial effluents or the capacity of wwtps before applying the cca the selected attributes and wq characteristics were normalized and standardized to reduce the influences of the scale and dimension of different attributes and wq variables used the optimal set of neighbors was identified by adjusting the value where different values for e g 0 05 0 1 0 15 etc were examined small values close to zero corresponded to large neighborhood ellipsoids while large values close to 1 corresponded to a small neighborhood ellipsoid fig 2 a value of zero corresponded to a neighborhood that includes the entire available gauged drainage units for example in the jack knife procedure for the estimation of ec percentiles at the assumed ungauged drainage unit we10 fig 2 showed the influence of different values of α on the number of neighbors the selection of the best set of neighbors was based on the rbias and rse values of the regression model output for example for the same site fig 5 showed the influence of different values of α on the number of neighbors as the α value ranged from 0 25 to 0 05 the number of neighbors ranged from 19 to 40 α 0 25 number of neighbors 19 while α 0 05 number of neighbors 40 as shown in fig 5 the number of neighbors had a great effect on the accuracy and precision of the estimated ec percentiles for instance when the number of neighbors was just 19 the accuracy presented by the rbias values were 52 62 45 33 and 36 15 for the ec 25th 50th and 75th percentiles respectively rrmse values were 27 69 20 55 and 13 07 respectively however the best accuracy and precision were identified at an α value equal to 0 05 with 40 neighbors where the rbias values were 16 79 12 79 and 11 15 for the ec 25th 50th and 75th percentiles respectively rse were 2 82 1 64 and 1 24 respectively fig 5 also demonstrates how the neighborhood approach using the canonical space improved accuracy and precision when compared to the approach using all the available gauged drainage units as shown in fig 5 the accuracy presented by rbias and precision presented by rse were much better at the α value equal to 0 05 40 neighbors than at the α value equal to 0 49 neighbors where the rbias values were 21 59 23 34 and 67 53 for the ec 25th 50th and 75th percentiles respectively rse were 4 66 5 45 and 45 60 respectively these results were observed at all 50 drainage units which confirms that using the neighborhood approach improved the accuracy and precision of the regression model output 4 3 regression analysis after identifying the set of neighbors for each target ungauged drainage unit nonlinear stepwise regression was applied to estimate the wq characteristics for example for the estimation of ec 25th 50th and 75th percentiles at the assumed ungauged drainage unit we10 the following regression models were applied ec 25th percentile 7 8578e 17 soil salinity 3 ec 50th percentile 9 3210e 17 soil salinity 3 ec 75th percentile 1 1150e 16 soil salinity 3 other examples for the applied regression models are presented in table 3 table 3 shows the regression equations and their performance indices for the estimation of the ec 25th 50th and 75th percentiles at three of the assumed ungauged drainage units in the western middle and eastern delta wn03 in western delta wq sampling site located at the ms01 in the drain no 3 outfall on nubareia canal middle delta wq sampling site located at the sabal drain outfall on the rosetta branch eh12 in the eastern delta wq sampling site located at the saft drain outfall on bahr hadus main drain fig 6 shows the observed and estimated ec 25th 50th and 75th percentiles respectively while table 4 shows the associated rbias rrmse and nsc values based on the jack knife sampling procedure fig 6 and table 4 show that on average the accuracy of the ec percentiles ranged between 0 719 and 1 584 as presented by the rbias values and the precision as indicated by the rrmse values ranged between 1 191 and 1 634 while the nsc values ranged between 0 958 and 0 973 however accuracy and precision varied among the 50 drainage units for example for the estimation of the ec 25th percentile the relative errors measured for each of the 50 drainage units ranged between 24 67 and 26 78 while the relative squared error ranged between 0 001 and 7 169 these variations were largely due to the presence of extreme cases drainage units extreme cases include drainage units with relatively large or small areas as compared with areas of most of the drainage units and consequently these extreme units have different levels of attributes e g fertilizer application drainage system total length for example units with relatively larger total areas will have larger cultivated areas larger amounts of fertilizers applied larger drainage systems etc table 4 shows similar results for ec and na but indicates significantly less precision for fe this was due to the less relevant catchment attributes included in the analysis for fe increased precision could perhaps be achieved by including attributes like concentrations of different wq indicators in the wwtp and industrial effluents in irrigation water and fe concentrations in soil to obtain better results for fe concentrations a careful study of its sources and updating the catchment attributes database is likely important there are several important differences between the approach proposed in this study and that proposed by khalil et al 2011 which is the only approach proposed for the estimation of wq characteristics at completely ungauged drainage units in summary i although both approaches involve cca and nonlinear data driven models in khalil et al 2011 the cca was used for data preprocessing before applying the ann using all the available gauged units while in the current study the cca was used to identify homogeneous gauged units following which the information provided at these units was used for the calibration of the nonlinear regression model only and not all the available gauged units ii the approach proposed in this study provided an estimation of the wq central tendency and dispersion at completely ungauged units while the approach proposed by khalil et al 2011a focused only on the estimation of the wq central tendency iii the approach proposed in this study showed more accurate and precise results than that proposed by khalil et al 2011a modifying the statistical approach proposed in this study to account for nonstationary wq variables represents an important direction for future research a nonstationary wq variable consists of two main components a stationary component and a nonstationary component s one method used to account for nonstationary variables begins with the isolation of each of the nonstationary variables into stationary and nonstationary components the statistical approach proposed in this study can be applied on the stationary components of the wq variables and the nonstationary components can then be reconstructed to estimate the wq percentiles another important direction for future work is to modify the proposed statistical approach to allow for the estimation of detailed wq records at completely ungauged watersheds results showed that the statistical approach proposed in this study can provide accurate and precise estimations of the 25th 50th and 75th wq percentiles at completely ungauged watersheds drainage units similarly the statistical approach proposed in this study can be used for the estimation of other percentiles e g 10th 20th 40th 60th 80th and 90th percentiles and consequently these sets of estimated percentiles can be used to construct concentration duration curves cdc at completely ungauged watersheds thus for a target ungauged watershed spatial interpolation can be applied to transfer information from the time series at neighbor gauged units guided by the computed cdcs at neighbor units and the constructed cdc at the target watershed to construct detailed wq time series at ungauged watersheds 5 conclusion in this study a novel statistical approach was proposed for the estimation of water quality percentiles at ungauged drainage units the proposed approach consisted of two components a neighborhood approach and nonlinear regression models the neighborhood approach was employed as a filter to identify similar gauged units using the canonical physiographic space the nonlinear regression models were employed to establish the functional relationship between the drainage units natural and anthropogenic attributes on one side and its water quality percentiles 25th 50th and 75th percentiles on the other the jack knife validation method was applied to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach using three metrics the rbias rrmse and nsc the influence of the neighborhood approach was evaluated by comparing the rbias and rse values corresponding to the outputs when the neighborhood approach was not applied and when it was applied as a filter to select the close neighbors to include in the regression calibration results showed that applying the neighborhood approach provided better results than including all the available gauged units in the regression calibration results also suggested that the selection of the drainage unit attributes affects the accuracy and precision of the estimated percentiles results demonstrated that the proposed approach was able to estimate the ec and na percentiles with very high levels of accuracy and precision while estimation of fe percentiles were relatively less accurate and precise due to the unavailability of relevant drainage unit attributes including attributes such as the concentrations of the fe in the wwtp and industrial effluents would be more representative than the wwtp total capacity or the average annual industrial effluents respectively it is thought that the concentrations of fe in the irrigation water and or in the soil could be other important attributes updating the drainage unit attribute database in the nile delta to include information on the concentrations of different wq indicators in the soil irrigation water wwtp and industrial effluents is recommended the approach proposed in this paper was developed to estimate three water quality percentiles under stationary conditions at completely ungauged drainage units for future studies it is recommended to evaluate the feasibility of modifying the proposed approach to account for detailed water quality records time series at completely ungauged drainage units or shortly gauged units and to account for non stationary wq data acknowledgements water quality data and drainage unit attributes were provided by the national water research center cairo egypt this research

6750,water quality and quantity data are essential for water resources management but historical records are not always available at sites where information is required especially for water quality wq data because of the high costs of implementing and operating water quality monitoring networks this leads to the impossibility impracticality of monitoring all streams watersheds in a region under monitoring a novel statistical approach is proposed for the estimation of wq characteristics 25th 50th and 75th percentiles at ungauged streams watersheds the proposed approach is based on developing a wq causes effects functional relationship which has not been done before the wq causes are represented by the watershed physiographic natural and anthropogenic attributes and the effects are represented by the wq characteristics for a target ungauged stream watershed i a canonical correlation analysis based neighborhood approach was applied to identify homogeneous gauged watersheds and ii nonlinear regression models were then calibrated using data available at the selected gauged watersheds to develop the causes effects functional relationship between the physiographic attributes as predictors and wq characteristics as dependent variables once the regression models were validated the physiographic characteristics of the target ungauged stream watershed were used to estimate its wq characteristics the jack knife validation method was applied to evaluate the proposed statistical approach using 50 gauged streams from the nile delta of egypt results showed accurate and precise estimation of the electric conductivity and sodium percentiles for iron relatively less precision was obtained due to the absence of attributes that can describe the iron concentrations keywords water quality neighborhood approach ungauged sites nile delta 1 introduction full understanding of different anthropogenic and natural processes that may affect water quality and quantity is very important for sustainable water resources management khalil and ouarda 2009 one of the main objectives of water quality monitoring programs is to help explain various water quality wq processes in addition wq monitoring programs provide water managers with essential data information for wq management however as it requires sufficient instrumentation equipment adequate funding and specialized personnel wq monitoring is a costly undertaking particularly in developing countries thus in most cases water quality monitoring networks wqmns are characterized by low density and inadequate distribution khalil et al 2011a even in cases of well designed wqmns with adequate spatial distribution it is often very expensive and impractical to cover all the streams watersheds in a particular region under monitoring consequently historical wq data may not always be available at sites where information is required for water quantity a lot of research has been published on the estimation of flood quantiles at ungauged or insufficiently gauged streams watersheds e g burn 1988 1990 1997 shu and burn 2004 cunderlik and burn 2002 2003 2006a b shu and ouarda 2007 chebana and ouarda 2007 2008 2009 chebana et al 2012 wazneh et al 2013 o brien and burn 2014 wang et al 2014 sun et al 2015 ahn et al 2017 as well as for the estimation of detailed water quantity records at ungauged streams watersheds

of this research on estimating flood quantiles at ungauged streams watersheds was based on empirical statistical approaches that use available hydrological meteorological and physiographic data in these studies the idea was to use information available at gauged streams watersheds to build a relationship between watershed meteorological physiographic attributes e g catchment area slope stream length on the one hand and hydrological characteristics e g flood quantiles on the other hand once the statistical approach is calibrated and validated one can use the meteorological physiographic attributes of the target ungauged stream watershed to estimate its hydrological characteristics of interest unlike the estimation of flood quantiles at ungauged streams watersheds the estimation of wq characteristics at ungauged streams watersheds is described by tens of wq indicators e g chemical physical and biological indicators and not only the streamflow and it is affected by anthropogenic factors agricultural industrial and domestic wastes more than the catchment attributes e g area slope in general water quality monitoring objectives can be summarized as follows whitfield 1988 harmancioglu et al 1992 i to assess wq trends ii to assess the influence of natural and anthropogenic attributes on the general trends in wq processes iii to assess the effectiveness of different measures for water pollution control and iv to assess the level of compliance with wq standards in addition wq data generated from wqmns are also used to assess general wq status over a region compute wq indices and to calibrate and validate wq models as well khalil et al 2011a showed that it is also possible to use wq data generated from gauged streams watersheds and their watersheds attributes to estimate wq characteristics at ungauged streams watersheds there are many conceptual numerical wq models available for the assessment of wq status using mathematical equations that describe the advection dispersion processes of conservative pollutants as well as transformation processes for non conservative pollutants e g water quality analysis simulation program wasp hydrologic simulation program fortran hspf proposed by the united states environmental protection agency usepa and mike11 proposed by the danish hydraulic institute dhi however due to the extensive calculation time required conceptual models remain limited to small watersheds khalil et al 2015 keupers and willems 2017 for example for a belgian catchment of approximately 40 000 ha mike11 took around four days to simulate only one year of data using an up to date computer keupers and willems 2017 another study which modeled the neuse river estuary using ce qual w2 took 2000 model runs to assess the uncertainty associated with only 7 parameters out of the 115 model parameters and it would take 1054 model runs to test the full 115 parameters bowen and hieronymus 2000 2003 lobuglio et al 2007 in addition to incorporate more details in the conceptual models conceptual models are normally developed using different software programs linking these programs is technically very difficult and time consuming keupers and willems 2017 recently keupers and willems 2017 proposed a rapid conceptual wq model by dividing the stream under monitoring into conceptual reservoirs which were modeled as plug flow reactors pfr and continuously stirred tank reactors cstr to simulate the spatial and temporal evolution of wq in the stream this newly developed conceptual model can provide accurate and precise results much more rapidly than conventional conceptual models however for the estimation of wq characteristics at ungauged streams watersheds it would be very difficult impossible to calibrate and validate such models due to the absence of data however data driven empirical models have found appeal because of their rapid development minimum required information accuracy and simplicity akkoyunlu and akiner 2010 khalil et al 2015 very limited research has been conducted for the estimation of wq status at ungauged streams watersheds recently researchers have sought to integrate wq monitoring data and wq models to derive wq information at ungauged watersheds or to improve uncertainty at gauged sites for example lobuglio et al 2007 proposed using bayesian maximum entropy bme to integrate wq monitoring data and modeling results to reduce uncertainty at gauged sites more recently khalil et al 2011a proposed integrating wq monitoring data and watersheds attributes in artificial intelligence models to derive information about wq at completely ungauged watersheds khalil et al 2011a proposed artificial neural network ann ensemble ann eann and canonical correlation analysis cca based eann cca eann models for the estimation of wq mean values at ungauged streams watersheds the ann and eann models were developed to calibrate the relationship between watershed physiographic characteristics as predictors and wq mean values as dependent variables as for the cca eann model the cca was employed to create a canonical physiographic space using wq data and physiographic attributes from gauged streams watersheds and the eann was then developed to calibrate and validate the relationships between the physiographic attributes in the canonical space as predictors and wq mean values as dependent variables to the best of the authors knowledge this is the only study that attempts to propose empirical statistical models for the estimation of wq characteristics at ungauged streams watersheds in this study a novel statistical approach is proposed for the estimation of not only the wq mean values but also the low and high percentiles at target ungauged streams watersheds which has not been done before in addition the proposed approach involves applying a neighborhood approach before developing the causes effects functional relationship to improve the accuracy and precision of the estimated wq characteristics 2 study area and available data egypt is a semi arid country where rainfall occurs mainly along its north coast ranging from 150 mm year to 200 mm year khalil et al 2011a away from the north coast the rain intensity decreases dramatically to scattered showers in middle egypt and rarely occurs in upper egypt the nile river is the main source of fresh water and represents about 97 of egyptian water resources khalil et al 2011a in egypt the per capita share of freshwater resources is already under the water poverty level 1000 m3 per person per year and it is expected to drop dramatically to around 450 m3 person year by the year 2025 abdel gawad et al 2004 to stretch their limited water resources the ministry of water resources and irrigation mwri has applied a water reuse strategy mainly in the nile delta the reuse strategy applied in the nile delta is based on pumping agricultural drainage water into irrigation canals at 21 sites known as mixing points or reuse sites to augment the freshwater supply dri 1998 the nile delta total area is about 1 9 million hectares while the cultivated area is 1 6 million hectares khalil et al 2011a the nile delta is dominated by agricultural activities with some scattered industrial activities and residential areas the nile delta agricultural drainage system consists of 22 main drainage catchments wq monitoring programs for the nile delta drainage system started in 1977 and have been operated by the national water research center nwrc of the mwri at that time the nile delta drainage system wqmn was designed mainly to assess the water reuse strategy by monitoring the drainage water quantity and limited wq variables that are principally related to water salinity after 20 years in 1997 the nwrc expanded the nile delta drainage system wqmn to cover 94 sampling sites where 33 wq indicators are measured on a monthly basis the design of the expanded wq monitoring program was based on a set of wq objectives i to assess compliance with wq standards ii to assess mass transport and iii to assess temporal and spatial trends nawqam 2001 out of the 94 sampling sites 21 sites were selected at the points where agricultural drainage water is mixed with irrigation fresh water to design evaluate the rates of mixing ten sites were selected in the main drains to assess water and salt balance thirteen sites were selected at the main drains outfalls to the mediterranean and northern lakes fifty sites were selected at drainage branches that serve small drainage catchments units and convey their drainage water to the main drains fig 1 the nile delta is divided into 94 drainage catchments units the drainage catchment unit is an area served by a branch drain that is drained by only one point on the main drain called the outfall of the branch drain as explained in khalil et al 2011a and applied in this study for any of the gauged drainage catchments units physiographic attributes represent the causes while the quality of the drainage water measured at the outfall of its branch drain describes the effects of the physiographic attributes on the wq status for each of the 94 nile delta drainage units a set of physiographic attributes that represents mainly agricultural activities as well as industrial and domestic influences was identified as follows cultivated area ha was considered by khalil et al 2011a instead of the total area because it is more representative than the total area with respect to the drainage wq average soil salinity ppm represents the salinity of the media where the drainage water passes to the field subsurface drains and then to the branch drains average soil hydraulic conductivity m d represents the ease with which the drainage water can pass through soil to the subsurface pipes and also represents the soil permeability and structure average total annual rainfall mm year represents meteorological factors that may have direct and indirect influences on the quality of drainage water in the streams drainage system total length km represents the longest distance that the drop of water travels to the branch drain outfall average total industrial effluents m3 day represents industrial effluents wastewater plant total capacity m3 day represents domestic effluents number of livestock represents animal wastes and total annual applied fertilizers tons year represents fertilizers agricultural influences it should be emphasized that the population data within each drainage catchment would be a very useful attribute but it was difficult to obtain population records at the level of drainage units in the nile delta population records are available only at the level of administrative divisions e g governorates similarly the quality of the irrigation water used at each drainage unit catchment would be useful to include in the list of attributes causes however information about the quality of the irrigation water is available at only 32 out of the 50 gauged drainage units in addition information about the quality of the wwtp and industrial effluents would be more useful than using the wwtp total capacity or the average total industrial effluents however there is no information available about the quality of the wwtp and industrial effluents table 1 provides the descriptive statistics of the identified attributes the proposed statistical approach explained in the following section is based on using stationary wq variables which did not show any trends in terms of annual characteristics the wq database of the nile delta drainage system was examined for stationarity using the kendall test kendall 1975 results showed that most of the wq variables measured in the nile delta wqmn are nonstationary the nonstationary characteristics of the wq variables may stem from for example frequently changing cropping patterns that shift based on farmer preferences these fluctuating practices often result in changes in fertilizer usage that may contribute to different patterns of nitrate residuals in the drains another possible source of the dynamic nature of the wq variables is the expansion of residential sewer systems in the region this could promote some negative trends in the fecal and total coliform levels in the drains as well as in other wq variables e g biochemical oxygen demand chemical oxygen demand and nitrates few wq variables showed stationary patterns including electric conductivity ec iron fe lead pb zinc zn sodium na magnesium mg ph and chloride cl these variables can be divided into major ions or salinity related variables ec mg na and cl and heavy metals related variables fe zn and pb in this study three wq indicators were selected to examine the proposed approach fe as representative of heavy metals and ec and na as representative of salinity and major ions for the selected wq variables results showed that at all of the 50 gauged drainage units the null hypothesis that there is no trend in the annual characteristics can be accepted at 0 05 significance level 3 methodology the proposed statistical approach is based on developing a functional relationship between the drainage unit attributes as predictors and selected wq characteristics as dependent variables by using information available at gauged drainage units once this functional relationship is calibrated and validated one may use the attributes of the target ungauged unit to estimate its wq characteristics one can use statistical techniques e g multiple regression or artificial intelligence techniques e g artificial neural network to estimate the wq characteristics e g ec 75th percentiles as dependent variables using drainage unit attributes e g cultivated area fertilizers applied and rainfall as predictors however due to the high levels of heterogeneity among the gauged drainage units using such techniques may not provide accurate and precise results unless a high level of homogeneity exists thus the neighborhood approach is proposed as a preliminary step before the development of the causes effects functional relationship the main goal of the neighborhood approach is to select only the drainage units that are similar to the target ungauged unit to avoid high levels of heterogeneity for instance instead of using all the available 50 gauged drainage units with a high level of heterogeneity the neighborhood approach ensures the selection of a subset of these 50 gauged units that are relatively homogeneous and similar to the target ungauged unit thus the proposed statistical approach consists of two main components i the neighborhood approach to select homogeneous gauged drainage units for each target ungauged unit and ii the development of the causes effects relationship for this specific target ungauged unit using information available at the selected homogeneous gauged units the two components of the statistical approach are carried out in four steps as follows the first step is to prepare data sets of i the required wq characteristics at gauged drainage units 25th percentile 50th percentile and 75th percentile and ii the drainage unit attributes as explained in the study area section in the second step the neighborhood approach is used for each target ungauged drainage unit to identify a set of similar gauged units the third step consists of estimating the regression model parameters for each of the required wq characteristics at each of the target ungauged drainage units using information available at neighbor gauged units that were selected in the previous step the fourth step is to apply the calibrated regression models using the attributes of the target ungauged drainage unit to estimate its wq characteristics it should be emphasized that a regression model will be developed for each wq characteristic at each ungauged drainage unit 3 1 estimation of wq characteristics at gauged drainage units the estimation of the wq characteristics at gauged drainage units consists of three steps i identify the best statistical model for each wq variable at each of the gauged drainage units ii construct the cumulative distribution function cdf based on the identified model statistical distribution and iii estimate the selected percentiles based on the constructed cdf in the first step each of the selected wq variables ec na and fe at each of the 50 gauged drainage units was examined for 10 different statistical distributions i normal ii inverse gaussian iii log normal iv log logistic v logistic vi exponential vii gamma viii generalized pareto ix weibull and x t distribution in this step for each wq variable at each gauged drainage unit the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 and the small sample aic aicc developed by hurvich and tsai 1995 and bayesian information criterion bic schwarz 1978 were used to identify the best statistical distribution which are defined as follows 1 bic ln n s 2 ln l 2 aic 2 s 2 ln l 3 aicc a i c 2 s s 1 n s 1 where s is the number of estimated parameters l is the maximum value of the likelihood function for the model and nis the sample size based on the best statistical model identified by bic aic and aicc a cdf was constructed and selected percentiles 25th 50th and 75th percentiles were then identified based on the constructed cdf it should be emphasized that the nature of wq data may include missing values outliers extreme values or that the data series may not be long enough to accurately represent the statistical distribution in this case non parametric approaches are preferable to identify wq characteristics at gauged sites e g shu and ouarda 2012 however in our case for the three selected wq variables the data set was complete and no outliers were observed thus the parametric approach described above was employed 3 2 the neighborhood approach in regional flood frequency analysis it has been shown that identifying gauged watersheds that are hydrologically similar to the target ungauged watershed provides more accurate and precise results than using all the available gauged watersheds for regional estimation grehys 1996a b different approaches have been proposed for the identification of similar gauged watersheds e g geographical regions homogeneous regions neighborhood approach grehys 1996a b compared four different approaches for the delineation of hydrologically homogeneous regions or neighborhoods with seven different regional estimation techniques their results showed that the cca based neighborhood approach provided good results with any of the seven estimation techniques in addition they concluded that the neighborhood approach is better than approaches based on fixed regions e g geographical regions for each target ungauged drainage unit the neighborhood approach aims to identify similar gauged drainage units similar characteristics from which one can transfer information to the target ungauged unit cavadias 1989 1990 1995 and ribeiro correa et al 1995 proposed the cca for the identification of hydrologically homogeneous regions given that different anthropogenic and natural factors may affect the quality of water which is attributed to various water quality indicators the cca is an ideal technique to evaluate this causes effects relationship the cca can explain the linear relationship between two sets of variables shu and ouarda 2007 in this study the cca is employed to evaluate the linear relationship between different wq characteristics on the one hand and different drainage unit attributes on the other in the current research the neighborhood cca based approach was adapted for the identification of gauged drainage units that are similar to the target ungauged drainage unit as explained in the following subsections 3 2 1 development of the canonical space assume that x x 1 x 2 x n is the matrix of physiographic attributes and y y 1 y 2 y m is the matrix of wq characteristics 25th 50th and75th percentile where n is the size of physiographic attributes considered and m is the size of wq indicators while n m assume any linear combination u of x 1 x 2 x n and v of y 1 y 2 y m where u and v are the canonical variables muirhead 1982 4 u a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 a n x n a x 5 v b 1 y 1 b 2 y 2 b m y m b y where a and b represent the canonical coefficients and a and b representthe transposes of vectors a and b respectively in this study several scenarios were examined including all the attributes as well as all the nine wq characteristics 25th 50th and 75th percentiles for each of fe na and ec or including only a selected subset of the wq attributes and three percentiles only either the same percentile for each of the three wq variables or the three percentiles for each wq variable preliminary analysis showed that the canonical space was significantly affected by the selection of the set of x and the set of y it was observed that it was better to select the attributes that significantly affect the selected wq variables for instance for the ec or na percentiles the cultivated area soil salinity soil hydraulic conductivity drain length and rainfall were the most significant attributes to be included in the x matrix it was decided that the best way to proceed was to have a y matrix including only the percentiles of one wq variable while the x matrix includes only attributes that affect this wq variable including all of the available drainage unit attributes would add some noise because of the absence of a relationship between the attributes in x and wq characteristics in y it should be emphasized that the causes effects relationship may change from one region to the other the canonical correlation matrix r shows the correlation between u and v and r d is the matrix of diagonal r the diagonal shows the correlation coefficients between each pair of the canonical variables u 1 and v 1 u 2 and v 2 u m and v m ribeiro correa et al 1995 6 r d r 1 0 0 0 0 r 2 0 0 0 0 r i 0 0 0 0 r m the canonical space created using v 1 and v 2 was then employed to identify neighbors for each target ungauged drainage unit to project the attributes of the target ungauged unit into the canonical space the canonical coefficients and r d were used as follows ribeiro correa et al 1995 7 u ug a x ug 8 v ug u ug r d where x ug is the vector of physiographic attributes at the target ungauged unit and u ug and v ug are the canonical variables at the target ungauged unit the r d and v ug were then used to identify the gauged neighbors as explained in the following sub section 3 2 2 neighborhood identification three steps were followed to identify the neighbors of each target ungauged unit first the ungauged unit was identified in the canonical space by defining its canonical variable v ug as explained in the previous sub section the mean position of the target ungauged unit in the canonical space was estimated by v ug second the vector of distances d between the target ungauged unit and each of the gauged units was determined using the mahalanobis distance mahalanobis 1936 as explained by ribeiro correa et al 1995 9 d v g v ug i r d 2 t 1 v g v ug t where i represents the identity matrix and v g represents the canonical variable for the set of gauged drainage units third the neighbor gauged units were identified based on the vector d a critical distance was used to compare the distances between the target ungauged drainage unit and each of the gauged drainage units if the distance to a gauged unit was less than or equal to the critical distance then this gauged unit was considered one of the neighbors to the target unit i e has similar physiographic characteristics the critical distance is selected from x 2 tabulated values based on the degrees of freedom which is equal to the number of dependent variables i e the size of y and a significance level which are adjusted during the calibration process for each target ungauged unit the confidence level 1 was defined as the set of drainage units for which the position v g in the canonical space meets the following constraint ribeiro correa et al 1995 ouarda et al 2001 10 v g v ug i r d 2 t 1 v g v ug t x p 2 where x p 2 is such that p x 2 x p 2 1 this equation represents the contour of an ellipsoid centered at v ug for each target ungauged unit after identifying its neighbor gauged units wq and physiographic characteristics from its neighbor gauged drainage units were used to calibrate the regression model for the target ungauged unit as explained in the following sub section the value of strongly influences the size of the ellipsoid and consequently the number of gauged drainage units considered as neighbors to the target ungauged unit as well as the degree of homogeneity among the selected neighbors the value of ranges between zero including all the gauged units and one no neighbors thus the value should be less than one and bigger than or equal zero considering a small value of large confidence level 1 guaranties including a larger number of neighbors than considering a large value of that guaranties selecting only very close neighbors fig 2 shows the influence of the value of on the size of the ellipsoid using a large value of small number of neighbors guaranties high levels of homogeneity since only the closest gauged units are included however with a small value of a relatively larger number of neighbors will be included which may be associated with lower levels of homogeneity although a higher level of homogeneity is guaranteed with a small number of neighbors it may be difficult to use this relatively small number of neighbors to calibrate and validate the regression model in the following step on the other hand a larger number of neighbors guaranties calibrating and validating the regression model but may introduce outliers higher level of heterogeneity explained by including gauged drainage units that are not similar to the target ungauged unit to identify the optimal number of gauged neighbors to consider for each target ungauged drainage unit different values for were considered various confidence levels 1 100 and the selection of the best confidence level was based on the accuracy and precision of the estimated wq percentiles the main task in this step was to find the optimal set of gauged units that provided the most accurate and precise estimation of the wq characteristics thus regression performance measures as described in the following subsections were used to identify the desired optimal set 3 3 regression analysis nonlinear multiple regression analysis was performed using data from the neighbor gauged drainage units the multiple regression technique was selected because it is simple and rapid to apply in addition it allows for the use of different statistical distributions in each of the gauged drainage units and is less sensitive than other techniques to the expected heterogeneity that may occur within the selected neighbors ouarda et al 2000 in general the power form function is commonly applied in regional flood frequency analysis ouarda et al 2000 shu and ouarda 2007 however the power form introduces additional bias due to the log transformation as explained by stedinger and tasker 1985 1986 in this study preliminary trials indicated that the nonlinear form provided better results than the power form with respect to the accuracy and precision of the estimated wq characteristics and provided much better results than the linear form as such the nonlinear form was applied in this study regression models were developed to estimate wq characteristics y using physiographic attributes x as predictors the calibrated and validated regression models were then used to estimate wq characteristics at the target ungauged drainage unit using its attributes xug as follows helsel and hirsch 2002 11 y β 0 β 1 x u g 1 β 2 x u g 2 β n x u g n ε where y is the dependent variable wq characteristics β 0 represents the regression intercept β 1 to β n represent the predictors coefficients x ug1 to x ugn represent the drainage unit attributes and ε is a random error different forms of the drainage unit attributes were considered in the nonlinear regression including all possible interactions and squared and cubic forms to identify the optimal set of predictors among all these possible linear and nonlinear predictors the stepwise forward selection approach was applied the nonlinear stepwise regression was recommended in this study given the large number of attributes that can contribute in a linear or non linear way to the estimation of the wq percentiles the stepwise forward selection approach consists of testing each predictor to be added to the regression model to check if is statistically significant one continues to examine each predictor until there are no additional improvements the ordinary least squares method was applied to estimate the regression parameters β 0 and β 1 to β n stedinger and tasker 1985 1986 fig 3 shows the flow chart for the proposed approach it should be emphasized that a separate regression model is presented for each wq characteristic at each ungauged drainage unit one of the main differences between the approach proposed by khalil et al 2011a b and that proposed in the current study is the use of the cca where khalil et al 2011a b used the cca for data pre processing in the current study the cca is used as a filter to identify gauged units that are similar to the target ungauged unit in both approaches nonlinear models were applied this is mainly due to the nonlinear nature of the wq causes effects relationships in khalil et al 2011a b artificial neural network ann models were calibrated and validated using all of the available gauged units while in the current study nonlinear stepwise regression models were applied the ann models may be preferable for use with a large data set while regression may be better suited to limited data sets nonlinear stepwise regression may be preferable because it can be applied to easily and simply select the optimal set of predictors among different possible linear and nonlinear forms of the drainage unit attributes in addition weights associated with each selected predictor provide a direct explanation of the contribution or the influence of this predictor on the target characteristic finally the approach proposed by khalil et al 2011a b was mainly used for the estimation of the wq central tendency however in this study the proposed approach was applied for the estimation of the wq central tendency represented by the 50th percentile and the dispersion represented by the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles 3 4 evaluation procedures the jack knife sampling procedure was employed to evaluate the proposed statistical approach in the jack knife procedure each of the 50 gauged drainage units was considered as the target ungauged unit while the remaining 49 gauged drainage units were used for the development of the canonical space various neighborhood sizes were then identified for the target drainage unit each related to a specific value as explained in the neighborhood identification section the proposed approach was evaluated using three metrics the relative bias rbias as a measure of accuracy the relative root mean square error rrmse as a measure of precision and the nash sutcliffe coefficient nsc as a measure of the model s overall performance nash and sutcliffe 1970 which are defined as follows 12 rbias 1 n i 1 n y i y i y i 13 rrmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i y i 2 1 2 14 nsc 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where n is the sample size 50 drainage units y is the wq characteristic mean value over n and y i and y i for i 1 n are the observed and estimated wq characteristic values respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 estimation of wq characteristics at gauged sites each of the selected wq variables ec na and fe at each of the 50 gauged drainage units was examined for ten different statistical distributions as explained in the methodology section the bic aic and aicc were used to identify the best statistical model as shown in table 2 table 2 showed the values of the bic aic and aicc for the ec measured at one of the gauged drainage units in western delta wq sampling site located at qusur drain outfall to the edko main drain we10 results indicated that the ec values measured at we10 followed the normal distribution with the smallest bic aic and aicc values for the ec values measured at the we10 the statistical moments were identified as follows 3 8637 the location mean value and 0 7342 the scale standard deviation knowing the data distribution e g normal distribution and the related statistical moments e g the location and scale different non exceedance percentiles were identified based on the cumulative distribution function as shown in fig 4 the selected characteristics of the ec were then identified as follows 25th percentile was 3 3686 50th percentile was 3 8637 and 75th percentilewas 4 3589 similarly the three selected percentiles were identified for each of the selected wq variables at each of the 50 gauged drainage units 4 2 neighborhood approach as explained in the methodology section unlike the estimation of flood quantiles at ungauged watersheds the estimation of wq percentiles at ungauged watersheds is described by tens of wq indicators in addition the watershed attributes included in most of the flood quantile studies are limited to the natural e g precipitation and watershed attributes e g total area general slope stream length but for the estimation of wq percentiles several anthropogenic attributes should be included the selection of the watershed attributes for the estimation of wq percentiles can be based on a wq causes effects relationship for the selection of the set of attributes to include for the estimation of each of the selected wq variables preliminary analysis was conducted as explained in the methodology section preliminary analysis based on trial and error indicated that the following attributes should be included for the estimation of the ec and na percentiles cultivated area soil salinity soil hydraulic conductivity rain fall and drain length these attributes were the best to use for both the development of the canonical space as well as for the estimation step using the nonlinear regression models for fe the following attributes were included for the development of the canonical space as well as for the regression models cultivated area hydraulic conductivity rainfall and fertilizers it was expected that attributes such as the average industrial effluents or the wwtps capacity would be good for the estimation of the fe characteristics however because not all the drainage units are exposed to industrial activities and some of these units have no sewage services and wwtps these two attributes included some zeros zero industrial effluents for non industrial units and zero for the capacity of wwtps at units without wwtps statistically speaking these zeroes affect the level of association with the fe percentiles watershed attributes that can be more useful representative for the estimation of fe percentiles may include i fe concentrations in the wwtp effluents ii fe concentrations in the industrial effluents and iii fe concentrations in the irrigation water the fe concentrations in the wwtp and industrial effluents as well as in the irrigation water are more representative and useful as attributes than the quantity of industrial effluents or the capacity of wwtps before applying the cca the selected attributes and wq characteristics were normalized and standardized to reduce the influences of the scale and dimension of different attributes and wq variables used the optimal set of neighbors was identified by adjusting the value where different values for e g 0 05 0 1 0 15 etc were examined small values close to zero corresponded to large neighborhood ellipsoids while large values close to 1 corresponded to a small neighborhood ellipsoid fig 2 a value of zero corresponded to a neighborhood that includes the entire available gauged drainage units for example in the jack knife procedure for the estimation of ec percentiles at the assumed ungauged drainage unit we10 fig 2 showed the influence of different values of α on the number of neighbors the selection of the best set of neighbors was based on the rbias and rse values of the regression model output for example for the same site fig 5 showed the influence of different values of α on the number of neighbors as the α value ranged from 0 25 to 0 05 the number of neighbors ranged from 19 to 40 α 0 25 number of neighbors 19 while α 0 05 number of neighbors 40 as shown in fig 5 the number of neighbors had a great effect on the accuracy and precision of the estimated ec percentiles for instance when the number of neighbors was just 19 the accuracy presented by the rbias values were 52 62 45 33 and 36 15 for the ec 25th 50th and 75th percentiles respectively rrmse values were 27 69 20 55 and 13 07 respectively however the best accuracy and precision were identified at an α value equal to 0 05 with 40 neighbors where the rbias values were 16 79 12 79 and 11 15 for the ec 25th 50th and 75th percentiles respectively rse were 2 82 1 64 and 1 24 respectively fig 5 also demonstrates how the neighborhood approach using the canonical space improved accuracy and precision when compared to the approach using all the available gauged drainage units as shown in fig 5 the accuracy presented by rbias and precision presented by rse were much better at the α value equal to 0 05 40 neighbors than at the α value equal to 0 49 neighbors where the rbias values were 21 59 23 34 and 67 53 for the ec 25th 50th and 75th percentiles respectively rse were 4 66 5 45 and 45 60 respectively these results were observed at all 50 drainage units which confirms that using the neighborhood approach improved the accuracy and precision of the regression model output 4 3 regression analysis after identifying the set of neighbors for each target ungauged drainage unit nonlinear stepwise regression was applied to estimate the wq characteristics for example for the estimation of ec 25th 50th and 75th percentiles at the assumed ungauged drainage unit we10 the following regression models were applied ec 25th percentile 7 8578e 17 soil salinity 3 ec 50th percentile 9 3210e 17 soil salinity 3 ec 75th percentile 1 1150e 16 soil salinity 3 other examples for the applied regression models are presented in table 3 table 3 shows the regression equations and their performance indices for the estimation of the ec 25th 50th and 75th percentiles at three of the assumed ungauged drainage units in the western middle and eastern delta wn03 in western delta wq sampling site located at the ms01 in the drain no 3 outfall on nubareia canal middle delta wq sampling site located at the sabal drain outfall on the rosetta branch eh12 in the eastern delta wq sampling site located at the saft drain outfall on bahr hadus main drain fig 6 shows the observed and estimated ec 25th 50th and 75th percentiles respectively while table 4 shows the associated rbias rrmse and nsc values based on the jack knife sampling procedure fig 6 and table 4 show that on average the accuracy of the ec percentiles ranged between 0 719 and 1 584 as presented by the rbias values and the precision as indicated by the rrmse values ranged between 1 191 and 1 634 while the nsc values ranged between 0 958 and 0 973 however accuracy and precision varied among the 50 drainage units for example for the estimation of the ec 25th percentile the relative errors measured for each of the 50 drainage units ranged between 24 67 and 26 78 while the relative squared error ranged between 0 001 and 7 169 these variations were largely due to the presence of extreme cases drainage units extreme cases include drainage units with relatively large or small areas as compared with areas of most of the drainage units and consequently these extreme units have different levels of attributes e g fertilizer application drainage system total length for example units with relatively larger total areas will have larger cultivated areas larger amounts of fertilizers applied larger drainage systems etc table 4 shows similar results for ec and na but indicates significantly less precision for fe this was due to the less relevant catchment attributes included in the analysis for fe increased precision could perhaps be achieved by including attributes like concentrations of different wq indicators in the wwtp and industrial effluents in irrigation water and fe concentrations in soil to obtain better results for fe concentrations a careful study of its sources and updating the catchment attributes database is likely important there are several important differences between the approach proposed in this study and that proposed by khalil et al 2011 which is the only approach proposed for the estimation of wq characteristics at completely ungauged drainage units in summary i although both approaches involve cca and nonlinear data driven models in khalil et al 2011 the cca was used for data preprocessing before applying the ann using all the available gauged units while in the current study the cca was used to identify homogeneous gauged units following which the information provided at these units was used for the calibration of the nonlinear regression model only and not all the available gauged units ii the approach proposed in this study provided an estimation of the wq central tendency and dispersion at completely ungauged units while the approach proposed by khalil et al 2011a focused only on the estimation of the wq central tendency iii the approach proposed in this study showed more accurate and precise results than that proposed by khalil et al 2011a modifying the statistical approach proposed in this study to account for nonstationary wq variables represents an important direction for future research a nonstationary wq variable consists of two main components a stationary component and a nonstationary component s one method used to account for nonstationary variables begins with the isolation of each of the nonstationary variables into stationary and nonstationary components the statistical approach proposed in this study can be applied on the stationary components of the wq variables and the nonstationary components can then be reconstructed to estimate the wq percentiles another important direction for future work is to modify the proposed statistical approach to allow for the estimation of detailed wq records at completely ungauged watersheds results showed that the statistical approach proposed in this study can provide accurate and precise estimations of the 25th 50th and 75th wq percentiles at completely ungauged watersheds drainage units similarly the statistical approach proposed in this study can be used for the estimation of other percentiles e g 10th 20th 40th 60th 80th and 90th percentiles and consequently these sets of estimated percentiles can be used to construct concentration duration curves cdc at completely ungauged watersheds thus for a target ungauged watershed spatial interpolation can be applied to transfer information from the time series at neighbor gauged units guided by the computed cdcs at neighbor units and the constructed cdc at the target watershed to construct detailed wq time series at ungauged watersheds 5 conclusion in this study a novel statistical approach was proposed for the estimation of water quality percentiles at ungauged drainage units the proposed approach consisted of two components a neighborhood approach and nonlinear regression models the neighborhood approach was employed as a filter to identify similar gauged units using the canonical physiographic space the nonlinear regression models were employed to establish the functional relationship between the drainage units natural and anthropogenic attributes on one side and its water quality percentiles 25th 50th and 75th percentiles on the other the jack knife validation method was applied to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach using three metrics the rbias rrmse and nsc the influence of the neighborhood approach was evaluated by comparing the rbias and rse values corresponding to the outputs when the neighborhood approach was not applied and when it was applied as a filter to select the close neighbors to include in the regression calibration results showed that applying the neighborhood approach provided better results than including all the available gauged units in the regression calibration results also suggested that the selection of the drainage unit attributes affects the accuracy and precision of the estimated percentiles results demonstrated that the proposed approach was able to estimate the ec and na percentiles with very high levels of accuracy and precision while estimation of fe percentiles were relatively less accurate and precise due to the unavailability of relevant drainage unit attributes including attributes such as the concentrations of the fe in the wwtp and industrial effluents would be more representative than the wwtp total capacity or the average annual industrial effluents respectively it is thought that the concentrations of fe in the irrigation water and or in the soil could be other important attributes updating the drainage unit attribute database in the nile delta to include information on the concentrations of different wq indicators in the soil irrigation water wwtp and industrial effluents is recommended the approach proposed in this paper was developed to estimate three water quality percentiles under stationary conditions at completely ungauged drainage units for future studies it is recommended to evaluate the feasibility of modifying the proposed approach to account for detailed water quality records time series at completely ungauged drainage units or shortly gauged units and to account for non stationary wq data acknowledgements water quality data and drainage unit attributes were provided by the national water research center cairo egypt this research

6751,over the past decades a new aquifer test technology sequential pumping tests or hydraulic tomography ht has been developed and successfully applied to many field sites to delineate the spatial distributions of hydraulic properties e g transmissivity t and storage coefficient s yet the reproducibility of its estimated t and s fields and the predictive capabilities of the estimates for different flow scenarios at different time periods remain unexplored that is to say if the estimated fields based on sequential pumping tests conducted during different years are the same since the geologic formation and processes may have undergone changes in order to answer this important question this study first compares the drawdown time behaviors from the sequential pumping tests spts conducted in 2010 with those conducted in 2012 at a field site and then finds they are similar but different in detail it then uses these data to estimate the t and s fields and checks the reproducibility of the estimates the estimated heterogeneity patterns are found to be generally reproducible in spite of uncertainties in addition the estimates from each year are capable of predicting the observed drawdowns induced by independent pumping tests during the corresponding year i e self validation moreover the estimated fields are cross validated that is this study uses the estimates obtained from the 2010 pumping tests to predict the observed drawdowns of the independent pumping tests conducted in 2012 likewise it uses the estimates from 2012 pumping tests to forecast the drawdowns of the independent pumping tests of 2010 the results of both self validation and cross validation indicate that the estimated t and s fields based on the test in one year can be used to predict bulk flow behavior in the other year differences in detailed behaviors may be attributed to changes in the processes omitted in the depth averaged flow model keywords reproducibility sequential pumping test hydraulic tomography ht 1 introduction aquifers are inherently heterogeneous at a multiplicity of scales such heterogeneity controls hydrologic processes comprehensive characterization of aquifer hydraulic properties thus is critical for groundwater resources management and groundwater contamination prevention and remediation yet traditional aquifer test analyses for estimating aquifer properties like the theis solution theis 1935 and the cooper jacob approximation cooper and jacob 1946 adopt the aquifer homogeneity assumption based on numerical experiments meier et al 1998 and sánchez vila et al 1999 advocated that the homogeneous hydraulic properties estimated by the cooper jacob approach represent the averaged properties over the cone of depression in the aquifer they claimed that the estimates are independent of the location of the observation well to the contrary wu et al 2005 demonstrated that the averaged properties are heavily weighted towards the heterogeneity in areas close to the pumping and to the observation wells and the dominant or large scale heterogeneity in other parts of the cone of depression they further pointed out that the governing flow equation upon which cooper jacob solution is based is an ensemble mean equation the equation describes the averaged behavior of an aquifer with many possible heterogeneous patterns yeh et al 2015a b to properly apply the ensemble mean solution to a field problem where only one heterogeneity pattern exists they suggested that theis s or cooper jacob s solutions ought to be fitted to drawdown time data from multiple observation wells over the cone of the depression in order to obtain representative averaged properties collectively field results from straface et al 2007 and wen et al 2010 corroborated the conclusion by wu et al 2005 which stated that applying the theis s or the cooper jacob s solutions to one observed drawdown time curve in a cross hole pumping test in a heterogeneous aquifer is tantamount to comparing apples and oranges thereafter huang et al 2011 used well hydrographs from 11 observation wells during each of eleven pumping tests at a field site and estimated the transmissivity t values of an equivalent homogeneous model and a highly parameterized heterogeneous model yeh et al 2015a b for each test they found that these estimated equivalent homogeneous t and distributed t values vary according to the location of the pumping well as such huang et al 2011 concluded that using a limited number of pumping tests and observation wells the estimated hydraulic properties for either an equivalent homogeneous or highly heterogeneous conceptual model likely are scenario dependent and not intrinsic characteristics of an aquifer they then demonstrated that a joint interpretation of multiple sequential pumping tests hydraulic tomography ht survey and analysis can minimize the scenario dependency of the effective homogeneous parameters or distributed parameter fields in fact a tomographic survey is a human instinct that is human always views an object from different angles and perspectives to obtain non redundant information and to synthesize these pieces of information to gain a complete description of the object exploiting this human nature medical scientists developed computed axial tomography cat scan technology and geophysicists created geophysical tomography survey techniques yeh et al 2008 similarly many hydrologists had proposed the concept of ht but yeh and liu 2000 are the first who developed a fully 3 d steady state hydraulic tomography ssht technology and demonstrated its robustness for mapping aquifer heterogeneity zhu and yeh 2005 then expanded the 3 d ssht to the transient hydraulic tomography tht and xiang et al 2009 modified the sequential successive linear estimator ssle to simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle which simultaneously includes all the pumping test data sets for tht analysis over the past decades ht survey with an appropriate inverse model such as sle qlga quasi linear geostatistical model kitanidis 1995 can identify the patterns of the heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity k and specific storage ss field in aquifers in a cost effective manner these works include vesselinov et al 2001a b liu et al 2007 illman et al 2009 berg and illman 2011a b zhao et al 2015 in particular in field scale e g tens to hundreds of meters problems ht has become a popular method for characterizing the spatial heterogeneity straface et al 2007 li et al 2007 huang et al 2011 berg and illman 2013 cardiff et al 2013 hochstetler et al 2016 sanchez león et al 2016 zhao and illman 2017 2018 more recently zha et al 2014 2015 2016 2017 utilized pumping induced drawdowns and fluxes to map the locations of kilometer scale faults and fractures as well as their hydraulic properties at a granite site likewise simsle has been successfully applied to delineate small scale fractures sharmeen et al 2012 moreover these studies showed that the hydraulic property fields estimated by ht could lead to a better prediction of flow hao et al 2008 illman et al 2008 2009 and solute transport illman et al 2010 2012 ni et al 2009 zha et al 2016 processes than the conventional characterization approaches mao et al 2011 challenged the traditional approaches for analyzing the results of pumping tests in unconfined aquifers and mao et al 2013 extended the ht analysis to variably saturated unconfined aquifers meanwhile sun et al 2013 investigated the effects of boundary uncertainty on the ht interpretation and suggested a temporal sampling strategy of the observed head for the ht analysis recently ht was expanded by zha et al 2014 to include flux measurements in the characterization of fractured geologic formations tso et al 2016 investigated the usefulness of flux measurements and prior information about the geology in ht analysis using the successive linear estimator sle zha et al 2017 developed a new ht algorithm that addresses multi scale heterogeneity and discrete geologic features in geologic formations unequivocally these ht studies have brought optimism to the development of a cost effective high resolution aquifer characterization technology in spite of cautionary notes about ht s ability by bohling and butler 2010 nonetheless the reproducibility of the estimated parameter fields by ht s for a field site over different years has not been investigated before that is to say over a period of time the regional flow recharge geologic heterogeneity and other unexplored factors may have changed these changes may lead to different estimates due to the omission of these factors in the model consequently it is logical to ask if the parameter fields estimated for a given field site using sequential pumping test data at different years would lead to the same estimates and if the estimated parameters during a previous campaign can be used to predict the flow field at the site at different times validation validation is a controversial and philosophical term in groundwater hydrology for instance a well cited paper by konikow and bredehoeft 1992 about three decades ago advocated that groundwater models cannot be validated but tested they stated case histories of model applications to the dakota aquifer south dakota to bedded salts in new mexico and to the upper coachella valley california illustrate that calibration produces a nonunique solution and that validation per se is a futile objective although models are definitely valuable tools for analyzing ground water systems their predictive accuracy is limited the terms validation and verification are misleading and their use in ground water science should be abandoned in favor of more meaningful model assessment descriptors we believe this view was built upon knowledge theories and models developed more than three decades ago for example using pumping test conducted at wall south dakota they articulated that the theis solution is adequate for predicting the short term response of the well at wall 40 hour pumping test to predict its long term response the leakage from the confining layers i e hantush modified leaky aquifer solution must be considered while they may have recognized effects of large scale heterogeneity leakage from the confining layers they failed to recognize that both theis and hantush hantush and jacob 1955 solutions are solutions to the ensemble mean equations they derive the ensemble mean behavior of the aquifer which is not the same as the observed drawdown time data at one well besides these equations yield scenario dependent aquifer properties as discussed previously likewise they used the groundwater modeling study of the upper coachella valley california to illustrate that a calibrated model yielded large uncertainty in predictions as such they suggested model assessment instead of model validation and verification once more the calibration of the upper coachella valley model did not exploit the tomography concept developed recently i e take advantage of non redundant information certainly we agree with the overall theme of their paper i e model assessment should focus on a complete understanding of the particular hydrologic system or problem of interest we however believe the paper merely presented an argument over semantics as articulated in the early part of this section our understanding of effects of heterogeneity and limitations of traditional models and advances in inverse modeling using ht have evolved tremendously over the past three decades a revisit to these validation verification or model assessment issues becomes logical for this reason this paper analyzes data from two sequential pumping test experiments conducted in two different years at a field aquifer specifically it first examines the reproducibility of the drawdown data from sequential pumping tests conducted in 2010 and 2012 i e spt 2010 and spt 2012 respectively at the same field site the reproducibilities of the estimated t and storage coefficient s of an equivalent homogeneous model ehm and a highly parameterized heterogeneous model hphm are then investigated in addition to direct comparisons of these t and s estimates from spt 2010 and spt 2012 this study evaluates the ability of these estimates for predicting the flow field due to independent pumping tests conducted in the corresponding year i e self validation the independent pumping test means that the drawdown data in turn the flow field from the tests have not been calibrated during the inverse modeling effort for estimating the parameters the study also cross validates these estimates that is the estimated t and s fields from spt 2010 are used to predict the drawdown field induced by the independent pumping tests in spt 2012 and vice versa finally the results of these validations are discussed 2 field experiments 2 1 site description and sequential pumping test spt the spt experiments were conducted at a field site on the north side of the campus of national yunlin university of science and technology nyust in taiwan eleven fully penetrating wells screened from 1 5 m below land surface to a depth of 20 m were installed over an area of 144 m2 they were distributed as shown in fig 1 and named as bh01 bh02 through bh11 each well was constructed with a schedule 40 high density polyethylene hpde pipe of 10 16 cm diameter and the length of the screen section was 18 50 m from 1 50 m below the ground surface and to the depth of 20 00 m and surrounded by a gravel pack the interval was perforated with 0 05 cm slots the wells were completed according to the specification of groundwater quality monitoring well no 0910091877 by environmental protection administration epa roc taiwan the stratigraphic cross sections a a and b b blue lines in fig 1 are depicted in fig 2 generally speaking the soil profile shows that the aquifer 16 4 m is mainly comprised of interbedded gravel sand silt and clay layers it is overlain by 3 4 m thick silty clay while the bottom is an impermeable clay layer the aquifer is generally considered as a shallow confined aquifer although it may not be fully confined over great lateral distances because of the complex interbedded silty clay layers in addition the experiment site is located in a forest area and the depth of roots is unknown the hydraulic heads in 2010 and 2012 fluctuated in the top clay layer fig 2 the spt 2010 took place from august 2010 to february 2011 the pumping rates ranged from 9 42 m3d 1 to 12 96 m3d 1 the spt in 2012 spt 2012 began in october 2012 and ended in january 2013 the pumping rates varied from 8 03 m3d 1 to 15 17 m3d 1 table 1 all the pumping tests during two spt experiments were conducted at days without any precipitation during each spt a pressure transducer with a data logger precision of 1 mm was installed in each of the eleven wells to collect the drawdown data measurement the submersible pumping system grundfos pumps corporation was utilized for each pumping test each pumping test lasted 72 h to ensure that a steady flow condition was achieved for each spt experiment eleven pumping tests were conducted during each pumping test one of the eleven wells was pumped and the drawdown time data were recorded at all wells after the drawdown had reached steady state the pumping was stopped once the groundwater level fully recovered a new pumping test began in another well as a result 11 pumping tests yielded 121 observed drawdown time curves including the pumping wells for each spt 3 groundwater model the analysis presented in this paper assumes that the groundwater flow in two dimensional depth averaged saturated confined heterogeneous or homogeneous aquifers can be described by the following equations 1 t x h q x p s x h t subject to the boundary and initial conditions 2 h γ 1 h 1 t x h n γ 2 q and h t 0 h 0 where h is total or hydraulic head l x is the spatial coordinate x x y l q x p is the pumping rate l3 t l3 at the location x p t x is the transmissivity l2 t and s

a version of the sle is used to estimate the parameter fields based on spt 2010 and spt 2012 data the algorithm of the sle has been discussed by many of yeh s colleagues yeh et al 1995 1996 zhang and yeh 1997 hughson and yeh 2000 yeh and liu 2000 zhu and yeh 2005 zha et al 2018 and thus only a brief discussion is given below sle adopts a highly parameterized heterogeneous conceptual model i e every finite element of the model has its own parameters to be estimated as such it discretizes the field site into n elements each element has a value for each hydraulic parameter i e natural logarithms of k and ss lnk and lnss respectively the sle then considers these parameters as spatial random fields characterized by unconditional means e lnk and e lnss where e denotes the statistical expectation and the unconditional perturbations lnk e lnk and lnss e lnss respectively these perturbations represent spatial variability of the parameters which is characterized by their covariance functions sle estimates the most likely parameter value i e conditional effective parameter value for each element given i e conditioned with the observed drawdown or head data from the ht survey as it is a bayesian geostatistical method it starts with some prior knowledge about mean values and covariance functions of the unknown parameter fields lnk and lnss these prior means are combined as vector y an ny 1 parameter vector in the numerical model ny is equal to n no of elements of the domain if lnk is concerned only and it is doubled 2 n if lnk and lnss are jointly estimated for transient problems suppose during a pumping test we have collected n d observed heads in time and space denoted by the data vector d the estimated parameter vector given the observation is y c subscript c denotes conditional and is iteratively determined using the following linear estimator 3 y c r 1 y c r ω t d d r where r is the iteration index the vector d r is the simulated heads at the observation locations and times obtained from the forward model eqs 1 and 2 using the parameters obtained at iteration r when r 0 y c e y the coefficient matrix ω nd ny denotes the weights which assign the contribution of difference between the observed and simulated head at each observation location and time at each iteration to a previously estimated parameter value at each element the superscript t denotes the transpose the coefficient matrix ω is determined by solving the following equations 4 ε dd r θ r diag ε dd r ω r ε dy r where ε dd is the unconditional covariance of observed heads and ε dy is the cross covariance between parameter and data where r 0 they become conditional or residual covariance and cross covariance when r 0 when observed heads are used to condition the estimates the parameter θ is a dynamic stability multiplier and diag ε dd is a stability matrix which is a diagonal matrix consisting of the diagonal elements of ε dd the solution of eq 4 requires knowledge of covariance ε dd and cross covariance ε dy which are derived from the first order numerical approximation yeh and liu 2000 5 ε dd r j d r ε yy r j d r t ε dy r j d r ε yy r where j d nd ny is the sensitivity matrix of head data with respect to the element wise parameter using the parameters estimated at current iteration the sensitivity is solved by an adjoint approach at iteration r 0 the ε yy ny ny is the unconditional covariance of parameters for r 1 the unconditional covariance becomes the residual or conditional residual covariance which is evaluated according to 6 ε yy r 1 ε yy r ω t ε dy the iteration between eqs 3 and 6 continues until some criteria xiang et al 2009 are met the final estimate is the conditional effective parameters and residual variances are the uncertainty associated with the estimate note that simsle can also adopt an ehm to estimate the effective parameters for the entire aquifer 5 analysis and results 5 1 evaluation criteria the mean absolute error l1 norm mean square error l2 norm linear regression analysis and standard correlation coefficient cor 0 r 1 were the performance statistics used in the evaluations of results of the following analyses 5 2 reproducibility of drawdown time curves in order to investigate the reproducibility of the drawdown time curves between spt 2010 and spt 2012 the drawdown time curves were normalized according to the following equations 7 s n s i j k t s i j k t q i k 8 t n t i j t i j r i j 2 where the s i j k t represents the normalized drawdown which is the drawdown s i j k t observed at time t at the observation well j during pumping at well i divided by the pumping rate qi in the kth year this is necessary since different pumping rates were used at different pumping wells and years the term t i j is the normalized time which is the observation time t i j divided by the square of the distance between the observation well and pumping well r i j 2 this normalization is based on theis solution for homogeneous confined aquifers yeh et al 2015a it aims to eliminate the distance effect such that effects of heterogeneity or other unknown or unaccounted factors e g recharge or leakage and others on the shapes of drawdowns can be illuminated the 110 normalized drawdown time curves from spt 2010 and spt 2012 and their means mean plus one standard deviation and mean minus one standard deviation are presented in fig 3 a and b overall the normalized observed drawdowns in spt 2010 are greater than those in spt 2012 since the drawdowns have been normalized with pumping rates differences in pumping rates are not the cause but other factors nevertheless as indicated in fig 3a and b the general shapes of drawdown time curves of the same observation wells in response to pumping at different wells effects of heterogeneity appear similar i e reproducible over the two experiments the first two columns of fig 4 a k show the contour map of the initial head distribution before each of the 11 pumping tests of spt 2010 and spt 2012 name of the pumping well and the year are labeled in figures these maps were constructed using the kriging tool built in tecplot i e unknown correlation scales and variograms and the observed heads at the 11 wells before pumping started these head values were obtained using measurements of the water levels in the wells before each pumping test started the third column illustrates the scatter plots of the normalized drawdowns observed in spt 2010 versus those in spt 2012 for the corresponding pumping test generally the spatial trends of the initial head distributions before each pumping test between the two years are similar indicating a regional flow pattern from southeast to northwest direction but they are different locally in particular notice the persistently higher initial heads near the southwest corners of fig 4b e and h k of spt 2010 than those of spt 2012 these are reflections of higher head values at bh03 bh09 bh08 bh11 bh05 and bh04 rather than effects of interpolations these differences also are manifested in the scatter plots of drawdowns as displayed in the third column of the figures that is most pairs of 2010 and 2012 drawdowns cluster along a straight line but some pairs at large drawdowns deviate from the line indicative of larger drawdowns at some wells during spt 2010 than spt 2012 experiments otherwise the drawdowns are generally reproducible 5 3 estimation of t and s using field data using the field pumping test data we first estimated the effective t and s based on the ehm they are the unconditional effective parameters first and we then estimated t and s fields of an hphm conditional effective parameters the word unconditional hereafter implies that the parameters do not attempt to reproduce the observed drawdown at each observation location but the overall drawdown trend of all the wells on the other hand the term conditional means that the parameters aim to reproduce the observed heads at each location and time as close as possible two approaches were employed for estimating the unconditional effective t and s parameters i e uniform effective t and s of an ehm the first approach adopted the traditional theis analysis based on the data from 11 pairs of cross hole tests and averaged these estimated t and s values we will call this as the unconditional direct average approach the other approach the unconditional ht approach employed simsle to estimate the effective t and s for the ehm associated with this aquifer using the drawdown time data sets 110 sets from the 10 pumping tests simultaneously while this approach also estimates the effective t and s of the ehm the estimates should be less scenario dependent because of the effects of scanning that is they consider different flow fields under various stresses afterward a conditional ht approach which employs the simsle with hphm was used to estimate the t and s values at each element of the numerical model for the field site for these estimations a study domain of 30 m 30 m in size was selected covering all the eleven wells of the field site and avoiding boundary effects on the simulations the domain was discretized into 900 elements of 1 m 1 m eleven wells were located within the red square 441 elements 21 m 21 m fig 1 boundary and initial conditions for the ht analysis of spt 2010 and spt 2012 data sets were assumed the arithmetic average of the initial water levels of all the tests in spt 2010 and all of those in spt 2012 they are 46 44 m and 46 33 m respectively all the observed drawdown time data were converted to water level time data and therefore the differences in initial and boundary conditions were avoided for the parameter estimation drawdown values at 7 different times were selected from each drawdown time data to expedite the analysis this selection was based on the temporal sampling strategy suggested by sun et al 2013 that is at the early rising limb of the drawdown log time curve the drawdown is most sensitive to change in s thus data at three closely spaced time intervals were selected the other four points were distributed over the rest of drawdown time curve 5 3 1 unconditional t and s parameters for ehm direct average approach the means of the effective lnt and lns values of the ehm for each spt are listed in table 3 notice that the t estimate from spt 2010 are smaller than that from spt 2012 and the s estimates from spt 2010 is larger thant that from spt 2012 unconditional ht approach this approach used the observed 90 drawdown data due to pumping at the 9 wells simultaneously the simulation domain grids initial and boundary conditions and input the mean and variance of lnt and lns were listed in table 2 notice the approach estimates only two parameters t and s which are uniform in space since it adopts the ehm as shown in table 3 the estimated value for lnt is 1 605 and that for lns is 4 491 based on data of spt 2010 and that is 1 841 for lnt and is 4 639 for lns based on spt 2012 data similar to the direct approach this approach also yields a smaller t estimate from spt 2010 than that from spt 2012 and greater s estimate from spt 2010 than that from spt 2012 table 3 overall this approach yields smaller t and larger s values than the direct average approach from the two spts 5 3 2 conditional t and s parameter fields for hphm next the 90 observed drawdown time data of spt 2010 were used to estimate the t and s values of each element in the domain of the hphm the simulation domain grids initial and boundary conditions and input mean and variance were identical to those used in the unconditional ht approach and the correlation scales were 10 m in both directions huang et al 2011 the same procedure was applied to the data from spt 2012 notice that data recorded from 10 observation wells from the two pumping tests at bh10 and bh11 were excluded from this estimation they were treated as independent pumping tests for validation of the estimates section 5 4 the estimated t fields of spt 2010 and spt 2012 are depicted in fig 5 a and b respectively they show a similar pattern of lnt distributions a high t zone red color appears around bh01 bh02 and bh10 and low t zones around the boundaries similarly the estimated s fields for spt 2010 and spt 2012 fig 5c and d respectively are low around the lower left and right boundaries and high s values along the upper north boundaries with two high value zones at the low corners in spt 2010 estimated field fig 5c as reported by sun et al 2013 misrepresenting no flux boundaries as constant head boundaries during ht analysis could lead to low t zones around the boundaries and vice versa accordingly we postulate that the low t and high s zones near the upper boundaries may be indicative of the existence of low permeable boundaries notice that the spt 2010 s estimates suggest two high s regions near the lower boundary where spt 2012 estimates infer low s values these two anomalies appear to agree the greater drawdowns observed in spt 2010 than those in spt 2012 since more water was stored at these locations and less water was available for the pumping the differences in the initial head distribution between spt 2010 and spt 2012 fig 4 seem to collaborate the differences in the estimates the residual variance maps of the estimated t fields for spt 2010 and spt 2012 are illustrated in fig 6 a and b respectively while those of the estimated s fields are in fig 6c and d the patterns of the residual variance maps for t estimates of the two spts are similar the same is also true for the s estimates the similarities are attributed to the fact that the residual variances solely depend on the locations of the wells and cross correlations between head and t or s a comparison of the residual variance maps of t and s the area of low variances of t estimates is broader than that of s estimates this is consistent with the results of cross correlation analysis by wu et al 2005 and sun et al 2013 the observed head at a well is highly correlated with the t anomalies at upstream regions of the pumping well and the observation well meanwhile the head is correlated highly with the s anomalies in a narrow area between the pumping and the observation well therefore the estimates of s over the domain involve greater uncertainty than the t estimates notice the slight differences between the residual variance maps of s between fig 6c and d likely due to numerical accuracy issues i e truncation errors and convergence criteria reproducibility of the t estimates is shown in fig 7 a where the estimated ts from spt 2010 are plotted against those from spt 2012 whereas that of the s estimates is in fig 7b in which the estimated ss from spt 2010 are plotted against those from spt 2012 overall these estimates are reproducible in terms of the general trends however t estimates are generally more reproducible than s estimates owing to the narrow area of the cross correlation between head measurements and the s anomalies for this reason densely distributed observation wells are needed to estimate s distribution correctly sun et al 2013 5 4 self and cross validations the estimated t and s fields from the field experiments cannot be directly compared with the unknown true fields in addition the ultimate goal of an aquifer characterization is to predict flow or solute transport processes in the aquifer accurately under any stresses therefore validation of the estimates by predicting drawdown fields flow fields which are not used during the inverse modeling efforts is a desirable approach as mentioned previously the pumping wells bh10 and bh11 were not used as either a pumping or an observation well in the inverse analysis these pumping tests thus created new flow fields and do not have the reciprocity issue in spt experiments i e they do not carry repeated information about the heterogeneity further the cross correlation analysis suggests that heterogeneity around bh10 and bh11 likely remains unknown even after the calibration that is to say if the estimates from the 9 pumping tests do not capture the heterogeneity at the site they will not predict satisfactorily the drawdown fields induced by the two new tests and vice versa for these reasons we use the estimated fields from the spt 2010 and spt 2012 experiments to forecast the temporal evolution of drawdowns at 10 wells of the pumping events at bh10 and bh11 during 2010 and 2012 i e self validation in addition cross validations were conducted in which the estimated t and s fields from spt 2010 were used to predict the observed drawdown fields induced by the two independent pumping tests in spt 2012 likewise estimates from spt 2012 are used to simulate the observed drawdown fields from spt 2010 this cross validation also serves as a means to check the reproducibility of the estimates with respect to their forecast abilities results of self validation of the estimates from the unconditional direct average approach based on spt 2010 and spt 2012 data are presented as scatter plots of the predicted vs the observed heads in fig 8 a and b respectively the cross validations of the two estimates are illustrated in fig 8c and d according to these figures both estimated fields yield significantly biased head fields of the two tests specifically the predicted drawdowns are significantly lower than the observed ones indicative of over estimate of t and under estimate of s values table 3 self validation results of the estimates based on unconditional ht approach with the data of spt 2010 and spt 2012 are displayed in fig 9 a and b meanwhile results of the cross validations of the two sets of estimates are shown in fig 9c and d as expected the t and s estimates from joint inversion ht produce less biased predictions in comparison with those in fig 8a and b that is the estimates using simsle are more realistic than those based on the direct average approach again the use of the 9 pumping test datasets allows the estimates to consider the 9 different flow fields simultaneously such that the estimates are representative i e ergodic for different flow fields the predicted head values are dispersed albeit unbiased that is they do not capture detailed behaviors of the aquifer because of unresolved heterogeneity and scale disparity between the head measurements and model see yeh et al 2015a b the self and cross validation results of conditional estimates for the hphm based on spt 2010 and spt 2012 are displayed in fig 10 a d respectively these results indicate that the estimates yield less biased predicted heads of the two independent pumping tests with smaller scatterings variances than the unconditional effective t and s of ehm similarly cross validation results suggest that the t and s estimates based on spt 2010 and spt 2012 data are satisfactory in addition to the scatter plots in fig 10 observed predicted well hydrographs and their upper and lower bounds of the spt 2010 and spt 2012 self validation are presented in figs 11 and 12 respectively and cross validation in figs 13 and 14 the upper and lower bounds are the predicted head based on the conditional ht estimates plus and minus one residual standard deviation i e the square root of the residual variance fig 6 of the estimates notice that the predicted heads within the bounds are located at the locations where the residual variance are small and vice versa we emphasize the fact that the magnitude of the residual variance depends on the value of the input guess variance for sle its real magnitude does not affect the estimates and the pattern but the magnitude of the residual variance as mentioned before the input variance for the sle was derived from the estimates based on theis approach these estimates are spatially smooth and have small spatial variability and in turn the variance in order words the actual variance or spatial variability is likely larger than this value and the gap between the upper and lower bound should be larger therefore all predicted well hydrographs would be enclosed within these bounds 6 discussion this study shows that the shapes of the drawdown hydrographs of the spt 2010 and spt 2012 were generally the same but the magnitudes of the drawdowns in spt 2010 were greater than those in spt 2012 since the drawdowns were normalized by the pumping rates the difference in magnitudes may be attributed to other factors such as regional flow recharge or alteration of the hydraulic properties due to earthquakes or other processes on the other hand the time axis of the drawdown curves was normalized by the square of the distance between the pumping well and each observation and the shapes of the drawdown time curves of the two tests are similar accordingly we may exclude the possibility of changes in hydraulic properties of the site over the two years yet contoured maps of the initial head fields before each of the experiments show that the regional flow trends as well as the boundary conditions are similar but different locally particularly at the southern boundary despite the difference we believe that the spatial trends of the initial head should not affect the estimates of unconditional t and s for this field site because drawdowns were used in the above analysis nevertheless both unconditional direct average and ht ehm approach yielded smaller t estimates from spt 2010 than those from spt 2012 and larger s estimates from spt 2010 than those from spt 2012 interestingly such results seem to explain the large drawdowns observed in spt 2010 if this is true the hydraulic properties then have been altered over the two year time span contradicting the previous conclusion based on the shape of the drawdown time curves we also recognized that the conditional ht hphm estimates for the two experiments closely resemble each other with some noticeable differences in s estimates near one of the boundaries of the aquifer in effect these results are consistent with the estimates based on unconditional approaches that is the large s values along the south side of the boundary contribute to the large estimated unconditional s value the question now arises if these changes in s estimate at the southern boundary are real or artifact as discussed above it is unlikely the aquifer properties could change significantly over the two years period and the differences in initial and boundary conditions unlikely could affect the estimates therefore we speculate that the discrepancies may be attributed to unexplored processes omitted in this depth average 2 d model such as recharge or root extractions perhaps these discrepancies may also support the claim that the t and s parameters in a depth average two dimensional flow model are phenomenological parameters that is the effects of the vertical variations of hydraulic conductivities see fig 2 and hydraulic gradients of the three dimensional heterogeneous aquifer are lumped into the effective t and s parameters as the regional flow or other processes change the vertical gradient varies and in turn the parameter values p168 yeh et al 2015a on the other hand since the wells are 20 m long one might speculate upon the wellbore effect at the pumping wells albeit the heads of the pumping wells were not used in the analysis and early time drawdowns which may be affected by the wellbore effect were avoided the wellbore effect at the pumping wells might slightly delay the arrival of drawdown at the observation wells and in turn affect the estimates of s however as indicated by the residual variance accurate s estimates are inherently difficult to obtain in spite of the absence of the borehole effect note that the t estimates are not affected by the borehole effects since they are not influenced by the early time data the self validation and cross validation of the estimated t and s fields using three different approaches yield different results the unconditional t and s values using the direct average approach consistently yield biased predicted drawdowns on the other hand the unconditional t and s values based on the unconditional ht approach yield less biased prediction with similar degrees of scatterings this corroborates with the result that unconditional t and s estimates based on the direct average approach are much larger than those based on the unconditional ht approach are simultaneous inclusion of all the test data into the analysis for the effective t and s of ehm corrects the inconsistencies between the estimates from using theis solution for each cross hole test further the unconditional ht approach even it is unconditional using a large number of data reduces the effects of noises on the estimates as expected the estimates from the conditional ht approach result in drawdown field predictions with the least bias and variance the reproducibility of the productivity of the estimated t and s is generally satisfactory although it is imperfect this imperfection is likely due to unknown processes which are neglected in the depth average model these issues are the subject of our next research while ht is a logical approach for collecting analyzing data yeh and lee 2007 a fully 3 d dimensional modeling and monitoring of flow in variably saturated media may be the only way to unravel the unknown processes and to reduce phenomenological effects on parameters in conclusion as articulated by yeh et al 2015a b reproducibility and predictability in groundwater hydrology would depend on the model resolution i e model scale and scales of our observation and interest at coarse resolution the traditional homogeneous approaches coarse model scale may work they may yield unbiased parameter estimates and flow predictions with large uncertainty at fine observation scales on the other hand ht with highly parameterized models fine model scale can lead to unbiased and less uncertain parameter estimates and flow predictions at the fine observation scale nonetheless reproducibility and prediction of groundwater flow always involve some uncertainty due to multi scale temporal and spatial variabilities and the limited resolutions of our models model scale as well as noise and model structure errors the results of this study corroborate the theme of konikow and bredehoeft 1992 model assessment or validation aims to improve our understanding of the particular hydrologic system or problem of interest nonetheless results of this study offer a more optimistic view than that those expressed by them that is if the aquifer is sufficiently characterized in terms of initial boundary hydraulic parameters and other processes the groundwater model is not just a tool for better understanding of the system but also a tool can be used to provide reasonable forecasts so long as scales of the model and observation are consistent yeh et al 2015a b of course our statement rests upon the results from a small experimental site and the two year periods of our

6751,over the past decades a new aquifer test technology sequential pumping tests or hydraulic tomography ht has been developed and successfully applied to many field sites to delineate the spatial distributions of hydraulic properties e g transmissivity t and storage coefficient s yet the reproducibility of its estimated t and s fields and the predictive capabilities of the estimates for different flow scenarios at different time periods remain unexplored that is to say if the estimated fields based on sequential pumping tests conducted during different years are the same since the geologic formation and processes may have undergone changes in order to answer this important question this study first compares the drawdown time behaviors from the sequential pumping tests spts conducted in 2010 with those conducted in 2012 at a field site and then finds they are similar but different in detail it then uses these data to estimate the t and s fields and checks the reproducibility of the estimates the estimated heterogeneity patterns are found to be generally reproducible in spite of uncertainties in addition the estimates from each year are capable of predicting the observed drawdowns induced by independent pumping tests during the corresponding year i e self validation moreover the estimated fields are cross validated that is this study uses the estimates obtained from the 2010 pumping tests to predict the observed drawdowns of the independent pumping tests conducted in 2012 likewise it uses the estimates from 2012 pumping tests to forecast the drawdowns of the independent pumping tests of 2010 the results of both self validation and cross validation indicate that the estimated t and s fields based on the test in one year can be used to predict bulk flow behavior in the other year differences in detailed behaviors may be attributed to changes in the processes omitted in the depth averaged flow model keywords reproducibility sequential pumping test hydraulic tomography ht 1 introduction aquifers are inherently heterogeneous at a multiplicity of scales such heterogeneity controls hydrologic processes comprehensive characterization of aquifer hydraulic properties thus is critical for groundwater resources management and groundwater contamination prevention and remediation yet traditional aquifer test analyses for estimating aquifer properties like the theis solution theis 1935 and the cooper jacob approximation cooper and jacob 1946 adopt the aquifer homogeneity assumption based on numerical experiments meier et al 1998 and sánchez vila et al 1999 advocated that the homogeneous hydraulic properties estimated by the cooper jacob approach represent the averaged properties over the cone of depression in the aquifer they claimed that the estimates are independent of the location of the observation well to the contrary wu et al 2005 demonstrated that the averaged properties are heavily weighted towards the heterogeneity in areas close to the pumping and to the observation wells and the dominant or large scale heterogeneity in other parts of the cone of depression they further pointed out that the governing flow equation upon which cooper jacob solution is based is an ensemble mean equation the equation describes the averaged behavior of an aquifer with many possible heterogeneous patterns yeh et al 2015a b to properly apply the ensemble mean solution to a field problem where only one heterogeneity pattern exists they suggested that theis s or cooper jacob s solutions ought to be fitted to drawdown time data from multiple observation wells over the cone of the depression in order to obtain representative averaged properties collectively field results from straface et al 2007 and wen et al 2010 corroborated the conclusion by wu et al 2005 which stated that applying the theis s or the cooper jacob s solutions to one observed drawdown time curve in a cross hole pumping test in a heterogeneous aquifer is tantamount to comparing apples and oranges thereafter huang et al 2011 used well hydrographs from 11 observation wells during each of eleven pumping tests at a field site and estimated the transmissivity t values of an equivalent homogeneous model and a highly parameterized heterogeneous model yeh et al 2015a b for each test they found that these estimated equivalent homogeneous t and distributed t values vary according to the location of the pumping well as such huang et al 2011 concluded that using a limited number of pumping tests and observation wells the estimated hydraulic properties for either an equivalent homogeneous or highly heterogeneous conceptual model likely are scenario dependent and not intrinsic characteristics of an aquifer they then demonstrated that a joint interpretation of multiple sequential pumping tests hydraulic tomography ht survey and analysis can minimize the scenario dependency of the effective homogeneous parameters or distributed parameter fields in fact a tomographic survey is a human instinct that is human always views an object from different angles and perspectives to obtain non redundant information and to synthesize these pieces of information to gain a complete description of the object exploiting this human nature medical scientists developed computed axial tomography cat scan technology and geophysicists created geophysical tomography survey techniques yeh et al 2008 similarly many hydrologists had proposed the concept of ht but yeh and liu 2000 are the first who developed a fully 3 d steady state hydraulic tomography ssht technology and demonstrated its robustness for mapping aquifer heterogeneity zhu and yeh 2005 then expanded the 3 d ssht to the transient hydraulic tomography tht and xiang et al 2009 modified the sequential successive linear estimator ssle to simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle which simultaneously includes all the pumping test data sets for tht analysis over the past decades ht survey with an appropriate inverse model such as sle qlga quasi linear geostatistical model kitanidis 1995 can identify the patterns of the heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity k and specific storage ss field in aquifers in a cost effective manner these works include vesselinov et al 2001a b liu et al 2007 illman et al 2009 berg and illman 2011a b zhao et al 2015 in particular in field scale e g tens to hundreds of meters problems ht has become a popular method for characterizing the spatial heterogeneity straface et al 2007 li et al 2007 huang et al 2011 berg and illman 2013 cardiff et al 2013 hochstetler et al 2016 sanchez león et al 2016 zhao and illman 2017 2018 more recently zha et al 2014 2015 2016 2017 utilized pumping induced drawdowns and fluxes to map the locations of kilometer scale faults and fractures as well as their hydraulic properties at a granite site likewise simsle has been successfully applied to delineate small scale fractures sharmeen et al 2012 moreover these studies showed that the hydraulic property fields estimated by ht could lead to a better prediction of flow hao et al 2008 illman et al 2008 2009 and solute transport illman et al 2010 2012 ni et al 2009 zha et al 2016 processes than the conventional characterization approaches mao et al 2011 challenged the traditional approaches for analyzing the results of pumping tests in unconfined aquifers and mao et al 2013 extended the ht analysis to variably saturated unconfined aquifers meanwhile sun et al 2013 investigated the effects of boundary uncertainty on the ht interpretation and suggested a temporal sampling strategy of the observed head for the ht analysis recently ht was expanded by zha et al 2014 to include flux measurements in the characterization of fractured geologic formations tso et al 2016 investigated the usefulness of flux measurements and prior information about the geology in ht analysis using the successive linear estimator sle zha et al 2017 developed a new ht algorithm that addresses multi scale heterogeneity and discrete geologic features in geologic formations unequivocally these ht studies have brought optimism to the development of a cost effective high resolution aquifer characterization technology in spite of cautionary notes about ht s ability by bohling and butler 2010 nonetheless the reproducibility of the estimated parameter fields by ht s for a field site over different years has not been investigated before that is to say over a period of time the regional flow recharge geologic heterogeneity and other unexplored factors may have changed these changes may lead to different estimates due to the omission of these factors in the model consequently it is logical to ask if the parameter fields estimated for a given field site using sequential pumping test data at different years would lead to the same estimates and if the estimated parameters during a previous campaign can be used to predict the flow field at the site at different times validation validation is a controversial and philosophical term in groundwater hydrology for instance a well cited paper by konikow and bredehoeft 1992 about three decades ago advocated that groundwater models cannot be validated but tested they stated case histories of model applications to the dakota aquifer south dakota to bedded salts in new mexico and to the upper coachella valley california illustrate that calibration produces a nonunique solution and that validation per se is a futile objective although models are definitely valuable tools for analyzing ground water systems their predictive accuracy is limited the terms validation and verification are misleading and their use in ground water science should be abandoned in favor of more meaningful model assessment descriptors we believe this view was built upon knowledge theories and models developed more than three decades ago for example using pumping test conducted at wall south dakota they articulated that the theis solution is adequate for predicting the short term response of the well at wall 40 hour pumping test to predict its long term response the leakage from the confining layers i e hantush modified leaky aquifer solution must be considered while they may have recognized effects of large scale heterogeneity leakage from the confining layers they failed to recognize that both theis and hantush hantush and jacob 1955 solutions are solutions to the ensemble mean equations they derive the ensemble mean behavior of the aquifer which is not the same as the observed drawdown time data at one well besides these equations yield scenario dependent aquifer properties as discussed previously likewise they used the groundwater modeling study of the upper coachella valley california to illustrate that a calibrated model yielded large uncertainty in predictions as such they suggested model assessment instead of model validation and verification once more the calibration of the upper coachella valley model did not exploit the tomography concept developed recently i e take advantage of non redundant information certainly we agree with the overall theme of their paper i e model assessment should focus on a complete understanding of the particular hydrologic system or problem of interest we however believe the paper merely presented an argument over semantics as articulated in the early part of this section our understanding of effects of heterogeneity and limitations of traditional models and advances in inverse modeling using ht have evolved tremendously over the past three decades a revisit to these validation verification or model assessment issues becomes logical for this reason this paper analyzes data from two sequential pumping test experiments conducted in two different years at a field aquifer specifically it first examines the reproducibility of the drawdown data from sequential pumping tests conducted in 2010 and 2012 i e spt 2010 and spt 2012 respectively at the same field site the reproducibilities of the estimated t and storage coefficient s of an equivalent homogeneous model ehm and a highly parameterized heterogeneous model hphm are then investigated in addition to direct comparisons of these t and s estimates from spt 2010 and spt 2012 this study evaluates the ability of these estimates for predicting the flow field due to independent pumping tests conducted in the corresponding year i e self validation the independent pumping test means that the drawdown data in turn the flow field from the tests have not been calibrated during the inverse modeling effort for estimating the parameters the study also cross validates these estimates that is the estimated t and s fields from spt 2010 are used to predict the drawdown field induced by the independent pumping tests in spt 2012 and vice versa finally the results of these validations are discussed 2 field experiments 2 1 site description and sequential pumping test spt the spt experiments were conducted at a field site on the north side of the campus of national yunlin university of science and technology nyust in taiwan eleven fully penetrating wells screened from 1 5 m below land surface to a depth of 20 m were installed over an area of 144 m2 they were distributed as shown in fig 1 and named as bh01 bh02 through bh11 each well was constructed with a schedule 40 high density polyethylene hpde pipe of 10 16 cm diameter and the length of the screen section was 18 50 m from 1 50 m below the ground surface and to the depth of 20 00 m and surrounded by a gravel pack the interval was perforated with 0 05 cm slots the wells were completed according to the specification of groundwater quality monitoring well no 0910091877 by environmental protection administration epa roc taiwan the stratigraphic cross sections a a and b b blue lines in fig 1 are depicted in fig 2 generally speaking the soil profile shows that the aquifer 16 4 m is mainly comprised of interbedded gravel sand silt and clay layers it is overlain by 3 4 m thick silty clay while the bottom is an impermeable clay layer the aquifer is generally considered as a shallow confined aquifer although it may not be fully confined over great lateral distances because of the complex interbedded silty clay layers in addition the experiment site is located in a forest area and the depth of roots is unknown the hydraulic heads in 2010 and 2012 fluctuated in the top clay layer fig 2 the spt 2010 took place from august 2010 to february 2011 the pumping rates ranged from 9 42 m3d 1 to 12 96 m3d 1 the spt in 2012 spt 2012 began in october 2012 and ended in january 2013 the pumping rates varied from 8 03 m3d 1 to 15 17 m3d 1 table 1 all the pumping tests during two spt experiments were conducted at days without any precipitation during each spt a pressure transducer with a data logger precision of 1 mm was installed in each of the eleven wells to collect the drawdown data measurement the submersible pumping system grundfos pumps corporation was utilized for each pumping test each pumping test lasted 72 h to ensure that a steady flow condition was achieved for each spt experiment eleven pumping tests were conducted during each pumping test one of the eleven wells was pumped and the drawdown time data were recorded at all wells after the drawdown had reached steady state the pumping was stopped once the groundwater level fully recovered a new pumping test began in another well as a result 11 pumping tests yielded 121 observed drawdown time curves including the pumping wells for each spt 3 groundwater model the analysis presented in this paper assumes that the groundwater flow in two dimensional depth averaged saturated confined heterogeneous or homogeneous aquifers can be described by the following equations 1 t x h q x p s x h t subject to the boundary and initial conditions 2 h γ 1 h 1 t x h n γ 2 q and h t 0 h 0 where h is total or hydraulic head l x is the spatial coordinate x x y l q x p is the pumping rate l3 t l3 at the location x p t x is the transmissivity l2 t and s x is the storage coefficient if the aquifer is conceptualized as homogenous ehm the values of t x and s x are independent of x h 1 is the prescribed total head at dirichlet boundary г1 q is the specific flux at neumann boundary г2 n is a unit vector normal to the union of г1 and г2 h 0 represents the initial total head 4 simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle simsle xiang et al 2009 a version of the sle is used to estimate the parameter fields based on spt 2010 and spt 2012 data the algorithm of the sle has been discussed by many of yeh s colleagues yeh et al 1995 1996 zhang and yeh 1997 hughson and yeh 2000 yeh and liu 2000 zhu and yeh 2005 zha et al 2018 and thus only a brief discussion is given below sle adopts a highly parameterized heterogeneous conceptual model i e every finite element of the model has its own parameters to be estimated as such it discretizes the field site into n elements each element has a value for each hydraulic parameter i e natural logarithms of k and ss lnk and lnss respectively the sle then considers these parameters as spatial random fields characterized by unconditional means e lnk and e lnss where e denotes the statistical expectation and the unconditional perturbations lnk e lnk and lnss e lnss respectively these perturbations represent spatial variability of the parameters which is characterized by their covariance functions sle estimates the most likely parameter value i e conditional effective parameter value for each element given i e conditioned with the observed drawdown or head data from the ht survey as it is a bayesian geostatistical method it starts with some prior knowledge about mean values and covariance functions of the unknown parameter fields lnk and lnss these prior means are combined as vector y an ny 1 parameter vector in the numerical model ny is equal to n no of elements of the domain if lnk is concerned only and it is doubled 2 n if lnk and lnss are jointly estimated for transient problems suppose during a pumping test we have collected n d observed heads in time and space denoted by the data vector d the estimated parameter vector given the observation is y c subscript c denotes conditional and is iteratively determined using the following linear estimator 3 y c r 1 y c r ω t d d r where r is the iteration index the vector d r is the simulated heads at the observation locations and times obtained from the forward model eqs 1 and 2 using the parameters obtained at iteration r when r 0 y c e y the coefficient matrix ω nd ny denotes the weights which assign the contribution of difference between the observed and simulated head at each observation location and time at each iteration to a previously estimated parameter value at each element the superscript t denotes the transpose the coefficient matrix ω is determined by solving the following equations 4 ε dd r θ r diag ε dd r ω r ε dy r where ε dd is the unconditional covariance of observed heads and ε dy is the cross covariance between parameter and data where r 0 they become conditional or residual covariance and cross covariance when r 0 when observed heads are used to condition the estimates the parameter θ is a dynamic stability multiplier and diag ε dd is a stability matrix which is a diagonal matrix consisting of the diagonal elements of ε dd the solution of eq 4 requires knowledge of covariance ε dd and cross covariance ε dy which are derived from the first order numerical approximation yeh and liu 2000 5 ε dd r j d r ε yy r j d r t ε dy r j d r ε yy r where j d nd ny is the sensitivity matrix of head data with respect to the element wise parameter using the parameters estimated at current iteration the sensitivity is solved by an adjoint approach at iteration r 0 the ε yy ny ny is the unconditional covariance of parameters for r 1 the unconditional covariance becomes the residual or conditional residual covariance which is evaluated according to 6 ε yy r 1 ε yy r ω t ε dy the iteration between eqs 3 and 6 continues until some criteria xiang et al 2009 are met the final estimate is the conditional effective parameters and residual variances are the uncertainty associated with the estimate note that simsle can also adopt an ehm to estimate the effective parameters for the entire aquifer 5 analysis and results 5 1 evaluation criteria the mean absolute error l1 norm mean square error l2 norm linear regression analysis and standard correlation coefficient cor 0 r 1 were the performance statistics used in the evaluations of results of the following analyses 5 2 reproducibility of drawdown time curves in order to investigate the reproducibility of the drawdown time curves between spt 2010 and spt 2012 the drawdown time curves were normalized according to the following equations 7 s n s i j k t s i j k t q i k 8 t n t i j t i j r i j 2 where the s i j k t represents the normalized drawdown which is the drawdown s i j k t observed at time t at the observation well j during pumping at well i divided by the pumping rate qi in the kth year this is necessary since different pumping rates were used at different pumping wells and years the term t i j is the normalized time which is the observation time t i j divided by the square of the distance between the observation well and pumping well r i j 2 this normalization is based on theis solution for homogeneous confined aquifers yeh et al 2015a it aims to eliminate the distance effect such that effects of heterogeneity or other unknown or unaccounted factors e g recharge or leakage and others on the shapes of drawdowns can be illuminated the 110 normalized drawdown time curves from spt 2010 and spt 2012 and their means mean plus one standard deviation and mean minus one standard deviation are presented in fig 3 a and b overall the normalized observed drawdowns in spt 2010 are greater than those in spt 2012 since the drawdowns have been normalized with pumping rates differences in pumping rates are not the cause but other factors nevertheless as indicated in fig 3a and b the general shapes of drawdown time curves of the same observation wells in response to pumping at different wells effects of heterogeneity appear similar i e reproducible over the two experiments the first two columns of fig 4 a k show the contour map of the initial head distribution before each of the 11 pumping tests of spt 2010 and spt 2012 name of the pumping well and the year are labeled in figures these maps were constructed using the kriging tool built in tecplot i e unknown correlation scales and variograms and the observed heads at the 11 wells before pumping started these head values were obtained using measurements of the water levels in the wells before each pumping test started the third column illustrates the scatter plots of the normalized drawdowns observed in spt 2010 versus those in spt 2012 for the corresponding pumping test generally the spatial trends of the initial head distributions before each pumping test between the two years are similar indicating a regional flow pattern from southeast to northwest direction but they are different locally in particular notice the persistently higher initial heads near the southwest corners of fig 4b e and h k of spt 2010 than those of spt 2012 these are reflections of higher head values at bh03 bh09 bh08 bh11 bh05 and bh04 rather than effects of interpolations these differences also are manifested in the scatter plots of drawdowns as displayed in the third column of the figures that is most pairs of 2010 and 2012 drawdowns cluster along a straight line but some pairs at large drawdowns deviate from the line indicative of larger drawdowns at some wells during spt 2010 than spt 2012 experiments otherwise the drawdowns are generally reproducible 5 3 estimation of t and s using field data using the field pumping test data we first estimated the effective t and s based on the ehm they are the unconditional effective parameters first and we then estimated t and s fields of an hphm conditional effective parameters the word unconditional hereafter implies that the parameters do not attempt to reproduce the observed drawdown at each observation location but the overall drawdown trend of all the wells on the other hand the term conditional means that the parameters aim to reproduce the observed heads at each location and time as close as possible two approaches were employed for estimating the unconditional effective t and s parameters i e uniform effective t and s of an ehm the first approach adopted the traditional theis analysis based on the data from 11 pairs of cross hole tests and averaged these estimated t and s values we will call this as the unconditional direct average approach the other approach the unconditional ht approach employed simsle to estimate the effective t and s for the ehm associated with this aquifer using the drawdown time data sets 110 sets from the 10 pumping tests simultaneously while this approach also estimates the effective t and s of the ehm the estimates should be less scenario dependent because of the effects of scanning that is they consider different flow fields under various stresses afterward a conditional ht approach which employs the simsle with hphm was used to estimate the t and s values at each element of the numerical model for the field site for these estimations a study domain of 30 m 30 m in size was selected covering all the eleven wells of the field site and avoiding boundary effects on the simulations the domain was discretized into 900 elements of 1 m 1 m eleven wells were located within the red square 441 elements 21 m 21 m fig 1 boundary and initial conditions for the ht analysis of spt 2010 and spt 2012 data sets were assumed the arithmetic average of the initial water levels of all the tests in spt 2010 and all of those in spt 2012 they are 46 44 m and 46 33 m respectively all the observed drawdown time data were converted to water level time data and therefore the differences in initial and boundary conditions were avoided for the parameter estimation drawdown values at 7 different times were selected from each drawdown time data to expedite the analysis this selection was based on the temporal sampling strategy suggested by sun et al 2013 that is at the early rising limb of the drawdown log time curve the drawdown is most sensitive to change in s thus data at three closely spaced time intervals were selected the other four points were distributed over the rest of drawdown time curve 5 3 1 unconditional t and s parameters for ehm direct average approach the means of the effective lnt and lns values of the ehm for each spt are listed in table 3 notice that the t estimate from spt 2010 are smaller than that from spt 2012 and the s estimates from spt 2010 is larger thant that from spt 2012 unconditional ht approach this approach used the observed 90 drawdown data due to pumping at the 9 wells simultaneously the simulation domain grids initial and boundary conditions and input the mean and variance of lnt and lns were listed in table 2 notice the approach estimates only two parameters t and s which are uniform in space since it adopts the ehm as shown in table 3 the estimated value for lnt is 1 605 and that for lns is 4 491 based on data of spt 2010 and that is 1 841 for lnt and is 4 639 for lns based on spt 2012 data similar to the direct approach this approach also yields a smaller t estimate from spt 2010 than that from spt 2012 and greater s estimate from spt 2010 than that from spt 2012 table 3 overall this approach yields smaller t and larger s values than the direct average approach from the two spts 5 3 2 conditional t and s parameter fields for hphm next the 90 observed drawdown time data of spt 2010 were used to estimate the t and s values of each element in the domain of the hphm the simulation domain grids initial and boundary conditions and input mean and variance were identical to those used in the unconditional ht approach and the correlation scales were 10 m in both directions huang et al 2011 the same procedure was applied to the data from spt 2012 notice that data recorded from 10 observation wells from the two pumping tests at bh10 and bh11 were excluded from this estimation they were treated as independent pumping tests for validation of the estimates section 5 4 the estimated t fields of spt 2010 and spt 2012 are depicted in fig 5 a and b respectively they show a similar pattern of lnt distributions a high t zone red color appears around bh01 bh02 and bh10 and low t zones around the boundaries similarly the estimated s fields for spt 2010 and spt 2012 fig 5c and d respectively are low around the lower left and right boundaries and high s values along the upper north boundaries with two high value zones at the low corners in spt 2010 estimated field fig 5c as reported by sun et al 2013 misrepresenting no flux boundaries as constant head boundaries during ht analysis could lead to low t zones around the boundaries and vice versa accordingly we postulate that the low t and high s zones near the upper boundaries may be indicative of the existence of low permeable boundaries notice that the spt 2010 s estimates suggest two high s regions near the lower boundary where spt 2012 estimates infer low s values these two anomalies appear to agree the greater drawdowns observed in spt 2010 than those in spt 2012 since more water was stored at these locations and less water was available for the pumping the differences in the initial head distribution between spt 2010 and spt 2012 fig 4 seem to collaborate the differences in the estimates the residual variance maps of the estimated t fields for spt 2010 and spt 2012 are illustrated in fig 6 a and b respectively while those of the estimated s fields are in fig 6c and d the patterns of the residual variance maps for t estimates of the two spts are similar the same is also true for the s estimates the similarities are attributed to the fact that the residual variances solely depend on the locations of the wells and cross correlations between head and t or s a comparison of the residual variance maps of t and s the area of low variances of t estimates is broader than that of s estimates this is consistent with the results of cross correlation analysis by wu et al 2005 and sun et al 2013 the observed head at a well is highly correlated with the t anomalies at upstream regions of the pumping well and the observation well meanwhile the head is correlated highly with the s anomalies in a narrow area between the pumping and the observation well therefore the estimates of s over the domain involve greater uncertainty than the t estimates notice the slight differences between the residual variance maps of s between fig 6c and d likely due to numerical accuracy issues i e truncation errors and convergence criteria reproducibility of the t estimates is shown in fig 7 a where the estimated ts from spt 2010 are plotted against those from spt 2012 whereas that of the s estimates is in fig 7b in which the estimated ss from spt 2010 are plotted against those from spt 2012 overall these estimates are reproducible in terms of the general trends however t estimates are generally more reproducible than s estimates owing to the narrow area of the cross correlation between head measurements and the s anomalies for this reason densely distributed observation wells are needed to estimate s distribution correctly sun et al 2013 5 4 self and cross validations the estimated t and s fields from the field experiments cannot be directly compared with the unknown true fields in addition the ultimate goal of an aquifer characterization is to predict flow or solute transport processes in the aquifer accurately under any stresses therefore validation of the estimates by predicting drawdown fields flow fields which are not used during the inverse modeling efforts is a desirable approach as mentioned previously the pumping wells bh10 and bh11 were not used as either a pumping or an observation well in the inverse analysis these pumping tests thus created new flow fields and do not have the reciprocity issue in spt experiments i e they do not carry repeated information about the heterogeneity further the cross correlation analysis suggests that heterogeneity around bh10 and bh11 likely remains unknown even after the calibration that is to say if the estimates from the 9 pumping tests do not capture the heterogeneity at the site they will not predict satisfactorily the drawdown fields induced by the two new tests and vice versa for these reasons we use the estimated fields from the spt 2010 and spt 2012 experiments to forecast the temporal evolution of drawdowns at 10 wells of the pumping events at bh10 and bh11 during 2010 and 2012 i e self validation in addition cross validations were conducted in which the estimated t and s fields from spt 2010 were used to predict the observed drawdown fields induced by the two independent pumping tests in spt 2012 likewise estimates from spt 2012 are used to simulate the observed drawdown fields from spt 2010 this cross validation also serves as a means to check the reproducibility of the estimates with respect to their forecast abilities results of self validation of the estimates from the unconditional direct average approach based on spt 2010 and spt 2012 data are presented as scatter plots of the predicted vs the observed heads in fig 8 a and b respectively the cross validations of the two estimates are illustrated in fig 8c and d according to these figures both estimated fields yield significantly biased head fields of the two tests specifically the predicted drawdowns are significantly lower than the observed ones indicative of over estimate of t and under estimate of s values table 3 self validation results of the estimates based on unconditional ht approach with the data of spt 2010 and spt 2012 are displayed in fig 9 a and b meanwhile results of the cross validations of the two sets of estimates are shown in fig 9c and d as expected the t and s estimates from joint inversion ht produce less biased predictions in comparison with those in fig 8a and b that is the estimates using simsle are more realistic than those based on the direct average approach again the use of the 9 pumping test datasets allows the estimates to consider the 9 different flow fields simultaneously such that the estimates are representative i e ergodic for different flow fields the predicted head values are dispersed albeit unbiased that is they do not capture detailed behaviors of the aquifer because of unresolved heterogeneity and scale disparity between the head measurements and model see yeh et al 2015a b the self and cross validation results of conditional estimates for the hphm based on spt 2010 and spt 2012 are displayed in fig 10 a d respectively these results indicate that the estimates yield less biased predicted heads of the two independent pumping tests with smaller scatterings variances than the unconditional effective t and s of ehm similarly cross validation results suggest that the t and s estimates based on spt 2010 and spt 2012 data are satisfactory in addition to the scatter plots in fig 10 observed predicted well hydrographs and their upper and lower bounds of the spt 2010 and spt 2012 self validation are presented in figs 11 and 12 respectively and cross validation in figs 13 and 14 the upper and lower bounds are the predicted head based on the conditional ht estimates plus and minus one residual standard deviation i e the square root of the residual variance fig 6 of the estimates notice that the predicted heads within the bounds are located at the locations where the residual variance are small and vice versa we emphasize the fact that the magnitude of the residual variance depends on the value of the input guess variance for sle its real magnitude does not affect the estimates and the pattern but the magnitude of the residual variance as mentioned before the input variance for the sle was derived from the estimates based on theis approach these estimates are spatially smooth and have small spatial variability and in turn the variance in order words the actual variance or spatial variability is likely larger than this value and the gap between the upper and lower bound should be larger therefore all predicted well hydrographs would be enclosed within these bounds 6 discussion this study shows that the shapes of the drawdown hydrographs of the spt 2010 and spt 2012 were generally the same but the magnitudes of the drawdowns in spt 2010 were greater than those in spt 2012 since the drawdowns were normalized by the pumping rates the difference in magnitudes may be attributed to other factors such as regional flow recharge or alteration of the hydraulic properties due to earthquakes or other processes on the other hand the time axis of the drawdown curves was normalized by the square of the distance between the pumping well and each observation and the shapes of the drawdown time curves of the two tests are similar accordingly we may exclude the possibility of changes in hydraulic properties of the site over the two years yet contoured maps of the initial head fields before each of the experiments show that the regional flow trends as well as the boundary conditions are similar but different locally particularly at the southern boundary despite the difference we believe that the spatial trends of the initial head should not affect the estimates of unconditional t and s for this field site because drawdowns were used in the above analysis nevertheless both unconditional direct average and ht ehm approach yielded smaller t estimates from spt 2010 than those from spt 2012 and larger s estimates from spt 2010 than those from spt 2012 interestingly such results seem to explain the large drawdowns observed in spt 2010 if this is true the hydraulic properties then have been altered over the two year time span contradicting the previous conclusion based on the shape of the drawdown time curves we also recognized that the conditional ht hphm estimates for the two experiments closely resemble each other with some noticeable differences in s estimates near one of the boundaries of the aquifer in effect these results are consistent with the estimates based on unconditional approaches that is the large s values along the south side of the boundary contribute to the large estimated unconditional s value the question now arises if these changes in s estimate at the southern boundary are real or artifact as discussed above it is unlikely the aquifer properties could change significantly over the two years period and the differences in initial and boundary conditions unlikely could affect the estimates therefore we speculate that the discrepancies may be attributed to unexplored processes omitted in this depth average 2 d model such as recharge or root extractions perhaps these discrepancies may also support the claim that the t and s parameters in a depth average two dimensional flow model are phenomenological parameters that is the effects of the vertical variations of hydraulic conductivities see fig 2 and hydraulic gradients of the three dimensional heterogeneous aquifer are lumped into the effective t and s parameters as the regional flow or other processes change the vertical gradient varies and in turn the parameter values p168 yeh et al 2015a on the other hand since the wells are 20 m long one might speculate upon the wellbore effect at the pumping wells albeit the heads of the pumping wells were not used in the analysis and early time drawdowns which may be affected by the wellbore effect were avoided the wellbore effect at the pumping wells might slightly delay the arrival of drawdown at the observation wells and in turn affect the estimates of s however as indicated by the residual variance accurate s estimates are inherently difficult to obtain in spite of the absence of the borehole effect note that the t estimates are not affected by the borehole effects since they are not influenced by the early time data the self validation and cross validation of the estimated t and s fields using three different approaches yield different results the unconditional t and s values using the direct average approach consistently yield biased predicted drawdowns on the other hand the unconditional t and s values based on the unconditional ht approach yield less biased prediction with similar degrees of scatterings this corroborates with the result that unconditional t and s estimates based on the direct average approach are much larger than those based on the unconditional ht approach are simultaneous inclusion of all the test data into the analysis for the effective t and s of ehm corrects the inconsistencies between the estimates from using theis solution for each cross hole test further the unconditional ht approach even it is unconditional using a large number of data reduces the effects of noises on the estimates as expected the estimates from the conditional ht approach result in drawdown field predictions with the least bias and variance the reproducibility of the productivity of the estimated t and s is generally satisfactory although it is imperfect this imperfection is likely due to unknown processes which are neglected in the depth average model these issues are the subject of our next research while ht is a logical approach for collecting analyzing data yeh and lee 2007 a fully 3 d dimensional modeling and monitoring of flow in variably saturated media may be the only way to unravel the unknown processes and to reduce phenomenological effects on parameters in conclusion as articulated by yeh et al 2015a b reproducibility and predictability in groundwater hydrology would depend on the model resolution i e model scale and scales of our observation and interest at coarse resolution the traditional homogeneous approaches coarse model scale may work they may yield unbiased parameter estimates and flow predictions with large uncertainty at fine observation scales on the other hand ht with highly parameterized models fine model scale can lead to unbiased and less uncertain parameter estimates and flow predictions at the fine observation scale nonetheless reproducibility and prediction of groundwater flow always involve some uncertainty due to multi scale temporal and spatial variabilities and the limited resolutions of our models model scale as well as noise and model structure errors the results of this study corroborate the theme of konikow and bredehoeft 1992 model assessment or validation aims to improve our understanding of the particular hydrologic system or problem of interest nonetheless results of this study offer a more optimistic view than that those expressed by them that is if the aquifer is sufficiently characterized in terms of initial boundary hydraulic parameters and other processes the groundwater model is not just a tool for better understanding of the system but also a tool can be used to provide reasonable forecasts so long as scales of the model and observation are consistent yeh et al 2015a b of course our statement rests upon the results from a small experimental site and the two year periods of our

6752,the objective of this study was to advance a new method to dynamically analyze the water environmental capacity wec of non point source nps pollution a soil and water assessment tool swat model and differential evolution de algorithm were coupled to automatically provide a calculation of the wec in a daily step the results showed that the largest ideal wecs occurred in the wet season with values up to 4500 t and 80 t for total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp respectively the ideal wec had a positive correlation with the rainfall intensity while the opposite was true for actual wec the smallest value of actual wec for tn was 150 t in june and a negative value also occurred in june for tp this is because nps pollution discharge was more sensitive to rainfall and flow change than the ideal wec compared to phosphorus the wec of nitrogen was more affected by the hydrological and nps pollution discharge conditions in addition the wec of nitrogen and phosphorus in organic species was more affected by seasonal change than that of nitrogen and phosphorus in inorganic species spatially the channels in the middle and southeast of the study area had the smallest actual wec and even negative values were observed the results of remnant wec showed that the smallest value occurred in july and june with values of 800 t and 140 t for tn and tp respectively thus significant attention should be paid to controlling nps pollution during the wet season and organic nitrogen and phosphorus should be set as the priority pollutants to control furthermore controlling the nps pollution discharge and enhancing the wec should be carried out simultaneously compared to previously used methods the calculation method employed in this study had the ability to simulate the transformation and interaction between nitrogen and phosphorus in organic and inorganic species and better considered dynamic changes in the input conditions keywords water environmental capacity non point source pollution temporal spatial analysis swat model differential evolution algorithm 1 introduction the source of pollutants discharged into the water can be classified into point source and non point source nps over the past few decades point source pollution has been effectively controlled while controlling nps pollution still presents significant challenges abdulkareem et al 2018 xu et al 2018 compared to point source pollution nps pollution has complex characteristics and great uncertainty de oliveira et al 2017 nitrogen and phosphorus contamination were the major components of nps pollution and can result in the eutrophication of water bodies as the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water is drastically reduced this leads to the death of aquatic animal and can finally threaten human health xu et al 2016 faust et al 2018 thus effectively controlling nps pollution to improve water quality has received research focus of late total quantity control has been widely used to control water contamination guan et al 2016 yu and lu 2018 and a key aspect of total quantity control studies is to improve the simulation accuracy of determining the amount of pollutants that can be discharged into a water column qin et al 2015 to improve water quality large number of studies have been conducted on controlling the discharge of nps pollution best management practices bmps are the most commonly used measures and include both engineering and non engineering measures ahn and kim 2016 li et al 2017 song et al 2017 the effects of combining different bmps on nps pollution control and the optimization of the spatial allocation of bmps have been widely studied ciou et al 2012 wu et al 2018 before implementing the bmps the limit for pollutant discharges into a given water channel should be confirmed zhang 2003 this concept was explicitly stipulated in the total maximum daily load tmdl provision in the clean water act mcconnell 2017 the water environmental capacity wec indicates the total amount of pollutants that can be discharged into the water volume in tmdl liang et al 2015 calculating the wec before implementing the bmps can effectively and economically improve the water quality xu et al 2013 a great number of studies concerning the wec have been conducted around the world li and zou 2015 zhao et al 2015 peng et al 2016 a basic analytical method was the most commonly adopted method to calculate wec because its use is easy and convenient xie et al 2014 liu et al 2018 the complex degradation of the pollutants and the interaction between different pollutants were generalized into a comprehensive degradation coefficient zhao et al 2015 to improve the calculation accuracy of wec some complex calculation formulas were used in combination with other mathematical methods zhang et al 2012 uncertainty analysis was also performed to analyze the impacts of the temporal change of the inputs on the wec calculation liu et al 2012 chen et al 2014 a geographic information system gis was used to provide a spatial analysis of the wec calculation results han et al 2010 however the current calculation methods do have some disadvantages many factors including water flow degradation coefficient pollutants types and emission method can affect the wec of a channel reghunathan et al 2016 under real conditions the water flow will change with variation in the precipitation and the degradation of the pollutants will be affected by the water temperature and biomass chen et al 2018a however these variables have been set as constants in wec studies hou et al 2016 furthermore most of the current calculations of wec are carried out for point source pollution without much consideration of nps pollution pan et al 2013 peng et al 2016 compared to point source pollution nps pollution varies with changes in the hydrological conditions nsenga kumwimba et al 2018 to better consider the temporal change of hydrological conditions degradation coefficient and nps pollution discharge hydrological water quality models should be used to provide continuous simulation outputs in addition pollutants can transform from one species to another which may have different effects on the water body shultz et al 2018 however interaction and transformation between different pollutants were seldom considered in past wec models li and zou 2015 this hypothesis would cause an overestimation or underestimation of the wec the calculation equations become very complex if the interaction and transformation processes are considered making it impossible for traditional analytical methods to produce accurate results alvarez del castillo romo et al 2018 many studies have found that optimization algorithms have performed satisfactorily when solving complex and non linear problems facci and ubertini 2018 to improve current wec calculation methods an optimization algorithm should be used to solve the complex equations that reflect the interaction between different pollutants in this study considering the interaction of the pollutants and dynamic changes in the input conditions the wec in xiangxi river watershed was analyzed using the soil and water assessment tool swat and the differential evolution de the main goals of this study were to 1 advance a new method to calculate the wec for nps pollution 2 analyze the impacts of dynamic changes in the input data on the wec calculation and 3 discuss the interaction of nutrient pollutants in different species and its effect on the wec calculation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the xiangxi river located between 110 47 to 111 13 e and 30 96 to 31 67 n is an important part of the three gorges reservoir fig 1 it is approximately 94 km long flows through three counties and has a drainage area of approximately 3099 km2 a humid subtropical monsoon climate dominates the climate of the xiangxi river watershed zhang et al 2014 the annual average precipitation is 1213 mm and the average annual temperature is 17 8 c the months of january february march november and december represent the dry season april may september and october represent the normal season and june july and august represent the wet season forest area with a proportion up to 80 dominates the total land use area in the watershed however due to excessive fertilizer application and unreasonable livestock breeding nps contamination is still a serious threat in the watershed wang et al 2018 2 2 the concept of water environmental capacity in this study three kinds of wec were calculated and analyzed ideal wec actual wec and remnant wec these three types showcased different aspects of wec the ideal wec was calculated under the ideal situation which meant the pollutants discharged into the calculated channel from the upstream channels and the corresponding subbasin were not taken into consideration i e the background concentration of the pollutants in the calculated channel was set to zero calculating the ideal wec could show the impacts of hydrological conditions on the dilution and self cleaning capacity of channels the ideal wec was calculated through the combined use of the swat and the de algorithm the actual wec was calculated considering the pollutants coming from the upstream channels under the actual conditions the water coming from the upstream channels would carry some pollution already accounting for some of the wec the actual wec represents the amount of pollution that could potentially be discharged into the channel from the corresponding subbasin by comparing the actual wec to the ideal wec the influence of upstream channels on the wec of the downstream channels can be revealed the actual wec is defined as eq 1 1 we c actual w e c ideal l o a d upstream where we c actual is the actual wec kg d we c ideal is the ideal wec kg d and loa d upstream is the amount of pollution coming from the upstream channels kg d the remnant wec was calculated considering both the pollutants coming from the upstream channels and the corresponding subbasin it represented the amount of pollution that was allowed to be discharged from the corresponding subbasin into the channel under the current discharge situation calculating the remnant wec could provide a reference for pollution management in a specific subbasin under the current pollution conditions the remnant wec was calculated using eq 2 2 we c re m n a n t w e c actual l o a d sub where we c re m n a n t is the remnant wec kg d we c actual is the actual wec kg d and loa d sub is the pollutants coming from the corresponding subbasin kg d to prevent water pollution the remnant wec should be calculated for a typical year for the wec of point source pollution a 90 guarantee rate method has been widely used to select a typical year with a relatively low flow condition zhang et al 2010 in this way a relatively serious pollution condition was considered as the wec of the point source pollution was primarily affected by the flow however this method was not suitable for the wec of nps pollution compared to point source pollution the discharge of nps pollution is significantly influenced by the flow thus for the wec of nps pollution both flow and nps pollution discharge amount should be considered when determining a typical year the actual wec was used as an evaluation criterion to select the typical year which takes both the impact of flow and nps pollution discharge on the wec calculation into consideration a series of years from 2009 to 2016 were sorted by actual wec in descending order and the year exhibited a 90 rate was selected as the typical year 2 3 swat model and differential evolution algorithm the swat is a semi distributed process based and time continuous model that has been widely used to simulate the impact of management on hydrological processes and water quality teshager et al 2017 it was developed by the united states department of agriculture agricultural research service arnold et al 1998 the simulation process can be further divided into a land surface process and a main channel process the equations in qual2e were used to describe the processes of nutrient transformation and degradation in the channel as displayed in the swat model the equations for nitrogen were eqs 3 6 3 δ o r g n str α 1 ρ a a lg a e β n 3 o r g n str σ 4 o r g n str t t 4 δ n h 4 s

the de algorithm a method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution related to a given goal it is an imitation of biological evolution in the real world yao et al 2018 de algorithms have been widely used in many study fields such as multi objective optimization and constrained optimization das and suganthan 2011 das et al 2016 compared to other optimization algorithms such as the genetic algorithm particle swarm algorithm and ant colony algorithm de has proved to be more robust and efficient in continuous encoding optimization zhang et al 2017 hou et al 2018 yang et al 2018 the main calculation processes of the de algorithm include the initialization of the parameter vectors mutation with differential operators and crossover and selection storn and price 1997 in contrast to other evolution algorithms de uses a donor vector to perform the mutation operation eq 9 9 v i t x r 1 i t f x r 2 i t x r 3 i t where v i t is the donor vector x r 1 i t x r 2 i t and x r 3 i t are the randomly picked vectors from the current population f is the mutation index defined by the user in this study the daily outputs of the swat model including the daily stream flow water temperature algal concentration and other factors related to the calculation of wec were used directly as the input of the de algorithm to calculate the wec the input concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen in organic and inorganic species were set as the variables for optimization with the de algorithm the final concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen were set as the objective functions which were calculated using the equations mentioned previously eqs 3 8 the goal of the de algorithm was to allow the final concentration of phosphorus or nitrogen to be as high as possible within the standard concentration limitation 2 4 calibration and validation swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup was used to calibrate the parameters in the swat model the program was developed to analyze the sensitivity and uncertainty of the parameters in the swat model and search for the best combination of the parameters abbaspour 2007 the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 algorithm in swat cup was used as the calibration algorithm as it has been proven to be effective for use in large watersheds rostamian et al 2008 the coefficient of determination r 2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were used as indicators to evaluate the accuracy of the model 2 5 input data and model set up the dem data were downloaded from the second version of the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global digital elevation model dataset with a resolution of 30 m http www gscloud cn the land use data in 2010 were interpreted from the landsat 5 tm dataset the soil data were obtained from the institute of geography chinese academy of sciences the physical and chemical characteristics of the soil in the study area were determined from a field survey and a chinese soil database the meteorological data of nine weather stations in the watershed were obtained from the yichang weather bureau the monitoring data of the daily flow total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn from 2009 to 2016 were collected from the yichang hydrographic office in hubei province china the tn and tp loadings were calculated by multiplying their monitored concentration of tn and tp with the corresponding flow the model was first calibrated using the observed data for the flow tp and tn from 2009 to 2014 and was subsequently validated using data from 2015 to 2016 then the model was run in a daily step to simulate the nps pollution discharge from each subbasin and simultaneously calculate the wecs for each channel the ideal wec was calculated first using the couple of swat model and de algorithm fig 2 then the actual wec and remnant wec were calculated based on the ideal wec using the equations mentioned before the water quality standard of tn and tp for the channels in the study area was set according to the water function zones divided by the government of hubei province two levels of water quality standard were included in this study area level ii standard 0 1 mg l for tp and 0 5 mg l for tn and level iii standard 0 2 mg l for tp and 1 mg l for tn fig 1 because there is no water quality standard of tn for rivers in china the water quality standard of tn for lakes and reservoirs was used as the standard for rivers in this study 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation in this study 21 parameters were selected to calibrate flow and 12 parameters were selected to calibrate tn and tp the calibrated values of all the 33 parameters were listed in table 1 the r 2 of flow tp and tn were all greater than 0 6 and the nse values were all greater than 0 5 during the calibration and validation periods fig 3 the calibration and validation results could be accepted with the r 2 values and the nse values of flow tn and tp larger than 0 5 chen et al 2018b the errors mainly occurred in the simulation of peak flow in which the water yield processes may be complex additionally the values of tn and tp were underestimated to a small extent compared to the observed values this may be caused by the overlooking of some point source discharge in the study area abdelwahab et al 2018 3 2 temporal variation of the water environmental capacity the annual change in the ideal wec indicated that the ideal wec has an obvious relationship with the annual precipitation fig 4 a and b for both nitrogen and phosphorus the higher the precipitation the larger the ideal wec for nitrogen the ideal wec of organic nitrogen was one time less than that of the inorganic nitrogen for phosphorus the ideal wec of organic phosphorus and inorganic phosphorus exhibited almost the same value in each year with the value fluctuating from 250 t to 500 t compared to the ideal wec the annual actual wec was much smaller particularly for organic nitrogen and phosphorus fig 4c and d the smallest actual wec of organic phosphorus occurred in 2015 with a value less than 50 t for organic nitrogen negative values of actual wec even occurred in 2010 2012 2013 2014 and 2016 with the lowest value observed in 2013 at about 2500 t the results of monthly variations in the ideal and actual wec showed that the ideal highest wec of tn occurred in the wet season with values up to 4500 t while the lowest values occurred in the dry season with values less than 1000 t fig 4e the ideal wec of the inorganic nitrogen occupied more than half that of the tn for phosphorus the largest ideal wec occurred in the wet season with values up to 80 t and the lowest value occurred in the dry season with a value less than 30 t fig 4f however the actual wec was quite different from the ideal wec for nitrogen the lowest actual wec was found in the wet season with a value of approximately 150 t in june fig 4g while the actual wec of inorganic nitrogen still had positive value in june the actual wec of organic nitrogen showed a very large negative value of approximately 350 t for phosphorus the actual wec of tp showed positive values for all months except june fig 4h although the actual wec of tp showed positive values in may and july there were not enough wecs for organic phosphorus the daily ideal wec results of tn and tp from 2009 to 2016 were arranged in ascending order with the corresponding subbasin loads fig 5 a the result showed that the ideal wec and subbasin load both had a positive correlation with the precipitation but the rate of change of the subbasin load was faster than that of the ideal wec to quantify the impact of precipitation on the ideal wec and subbasin load fitting curves of precipitation with the ideal wec and precipitation with subbasin load were drawn fig 5b and c the results showed that the relationship between precipitation and the ideal wec or subbasin load was congruous with the quadratic function relation the r 2 values were all larger than 0 5 except the fitting between the precipitation and ideal wec of tp the r 2 of the fitting between the precipitation and subbasin load was larger than that between precipitation and the ideal wec furthermore the quadratic term coefficient of the fitting between precipitation and the subbasin load was larger than that between precipitation and the ideal wec 3 3 spatial distribution of the actual water environmental capacity the spatial distribution of the actual wec showed that more than one fifth of the channels had negative values for actual wec of total nitrogen fig 6 a the lowest value occurred in channel 16 with a value less than 120 t all the channels had enough actual wec for inorganic nitrogen except channel 12 and 16 and the subbasin loads were smaller than the actual wec in most of the channels fig 6b about half of the channels had negative values for the actual wec of organic nitrogen and the subbasin loads all exceeded the actual wec in the corresponding channels fig 6c for phosphorus all the channels had positive values for actual wec of tp except channel 22 fig 6d the values were much larger than the corresponding subbasin loads at the downstream channels but much smaller at the upstream and midstream channels all the channels had positive values for the actual wec of inorganic phosphorus fig 6e while several channels mainly located in the southeast of the watershed had negative values for that of organic phosphorus fig 6f the actual wec of nitrogen was more affected by seasonal change than that of phosphorus particularly for the channels in the middle and southeast of the watershed fig 7 a and d in most of the channels the variations of the actual wec across different seasons showed that for both nitrogen and phosphorus in inorganic species the actual wec had a descending order wet normal dry fig 7b and e some negative values even occurred in the dry season for inorganic nitrogen the channels near the outlet of the watershed had larger wec values than the others in contrast for phosphorus and nitrogen in organic species most of the channels had negative values for actual wec in the wet season while all the channels had positive wec values in the dry season fig 7c and f 3 4 evaluation of the remnant water environmental capacity in this study 2012 which exhibited a relatively small actual wec that indicates relatively serious contamination was selected as the typical year table 2 the results showed that july had the smallest remnant wec for tn with a value of up to 800 t fig 8 a in which the wec for inorganic and organic nitrogen was 100 t and 900 t respectively july had the largest subbasin load with value of 100 t 400 t and 500 t for inorganic nitrogen organic nitrogen and total nitrogen respectively for phosphorus negative values of remnant wec occurred in the wet season fig 8b june had the smallest values of about 40 t 100 t and 140 t for inorganic organic and tp respectively the subbasin loads were 50 t 100 t and 150 t for inorganic organic and tp respectively spatially the variation of nitrogen and phosphorus was different fig 9 a for nitrogen most of the channels had negative values for the remnant wec of organic nitrogen and channel 16 had the smallest value of up to 125 t while most of the channels had positive values for the remnant wec of inorganic nitrogen no remnant wec existed for inorganic phosphorus in most of the channels however in the channels near the outlet of the watershed an abundance of remnant wec existed the seasonal change had significant effects on the variation of remnant wec the negative wec values of tn and tp occurred in the wet season fig 9b some negative values occurred in the dry season for inorganic nitrogen and most of the channels had negative values for inorganic phosphorus fig 9c for organic nitrogen and phosphorus almost all the channels had negative wec values across all seasons particularly in the wet season fig 9d 4 discussion the temporal change of the ideal wec was significantly affected by precipitation change because the dilution capacity was based on the water volume in the channel the more water in the channel the more pollutants that can be discharged into the channel zhang et al 2012 however in some months the ideal wec was large with a relatively low amount of precipitation this could be explained by the fact that the temperature was high in these months leading to a large degradation coefficient that improved the self cleaning capacity of the water volume borah et al 2006 the transformation between different species of nitrogen included organic nitrogen to inorganic nitrogen algal nitrogen to organic nitrogen and inorganic nitrogen to algal nitrogen yi et al 2017 the larger ideal wec of inorganic nitrogen than that of the organic nitrogen indicated that the transformation from organic nitrogen to inorganic nitrogen was weak in the channels of the study area and that the transformation from algal nitrogen to organic nitrogen may be active due to the eutrophication in the study area wang et al 2018 the results of the actual wec showed that the nps pollution in the area was already serious the negative values mainly occurred in the years with large rainfall because water and soil erosion are enhanced under these conditions and lead to the discharge of a large amount of pollution into the channels kinnell 2017 furthermore although negative values mainly occurred in the wet season the highest values of ideal wec were also observed in the wet season this is explained by the fact that although the large flow volume in the channel improved the ideal wec the discharge of nps pollutants also increased shen et al 2014 the smaller quadratic term coefficient of the fitting curve observed between precipitation and the ideal wec compared to that of precipitation and the subbasin load indicated that the increasing trend of subbasin load was faster than that of the ideal wec with an increase of precipitation i e the subbasin load was more affected by hydrological conditions than the ideal wec thus contrary to the actual wec of point source pollution the actual wec of nps pollution becomes even smaller under large flow conditions under this phenomenon selecting a typical year based only on the small flow was not feasible for the wec calculation of nps pollution the actual wec should be used as the criterion for selecting the typical year as it takes the impact of flow and nps pollution discharge on wec into consideration seasonal change had a more obvious effects on the actual wec of nitrogen than that of phosphorus because the nitrogen pollution was the main nps contamination in the study area due to the excessive use of nitrogen fertilizer song et al 2016 liu et al 2017 the actual wec of organic nitrogen and phosphorus was affected more by seasonal change than that of the inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus indicating that the loss of organic nitrogen and phosphorus was more affected by precipitation than that of the inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus in this area this is reasonable because in contrast to inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus the nitrogen and phosphorus in organic species are mainly adsorbed to the sediment king et al 2015 thus when the rainfall was low it was relatively hard for the sediment to be transported with the water into the channel under this condition the loss of nitrogen and phosphorus occurred primarily in the inorganic species the actual wec of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus was larger than the subbasin load in most of the channels indicating that the loss of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus in the watershed was acceptable for organic nitrogen and phosphorus the subbasin load should be reduced especially in the middle and southeast of the watershed where farming activities are intensive liu et al 2016 the negative values of the actual wec indicated that excess pollutants were discharged into the channel from upstream channels thus controlling nps contamination in the upstream channels should be pursued before the management of the downstream channels the results of the remnant wec indicated that more attention should be paid to the control of nps pollution discharge in the wet season especially for organic nitrogen and phosphorus however the subbasin load of organic phosphorus was relatively small fig 8b this phenomenon indicated that to control the phosphorus contamination in the watershed only reducing the discharge of organic phosphorus is not enough more efforts should be made to enhance the wec in the channels such as increasing the water retention time enhancing the bioactivity of the microorganisms in the channels and changing the physical characteristics of the channels etc liu et al 2013 davis et al 2015 mahl et al 2015 furthermore an abundance of remnant wec existed in the channels near the outlet of the watershed due to the large flow volume and complex redox condition in those areas braskerud et al 2005 5 conclusions this study was the first attempt to use the swat model and de algorithm to dynamically analyze the wec of nps pollution on the watershed scale this method fully utilized the outputs of the swat model and took temporal variation in the calculation parameters into consideration what s more wec of nitrogen and phosphorus in organic and inorganic species was calculated separately instead of only considering tn and tp revealing the transformation and interaction between nitrogen and phosphorus in organic and inorganic species the ideal wec results showed that the hydrological conditions especially the flow had significant effect on the acceptable pollutants capacity of the channels the actual wec was much smaller than the ideal wec which indicated that the pollutant discharge of the upstream channels had greatly influenced the wec of the downstream channels thus it is important to balance the relationship between upstream and downstream the remnant wec results showed that the reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus discharge into water from nps is extremely urgent the results showed that control of nps pollution discharge in wet the season is of great importance although the ideal wec was large in the wet season nps contamination was also serious the rate of increase in nps pollution discharge was larger than that of the ideal wec additionally the spatial distribution of the wec was not uniform there was no remnant wec left in the middle and southeast of the watershed while abundant wec existed in the channels near the outlet of the watershed separate management of the organic and inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus should be used instead of a combined management of tn and tp because the wec of tn and tp showed positive values negative values may occur for inorganic or organic nitrogen and phosphorus compared to inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus more attention should be paid to the management of organic nitrogen and phosphorus the wec of organic nitrogen and phosphorus was generally smaller than that of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus and was more affected by seasonal change controlling the discharge of nps pollution and increasing the wec of the channels should be carried out simultaneously however some channels did not receive much pollutant discharge and thus continuing to attempt to further reduce nps pollution discharge may be difficult and inefficient focusing efforts on increasing the wec to allow more pollutants to be discharged into the channels may be more efficient acknowledgments this study was funded by the national natural science foundation of china

presented in or the review of the manuscript entitled temporal spatial analysis of water environmental capacity based on the couple of swat model and differential evolution algorithm 
6752,the objective of this study was to advance a new method to dynamically analyze the water environmental capacity wec of non point source nps pollution a soil and water assessment tool swat model and differential evolution de algorithm were coupled to automatically provide a calculation of the wec in a daily step the results showed that the largest ideal wecs occurred in the wet season with values up to 4500 t and 80 t for total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp respectively the ideal wec had a positive correlation with the rainfall intensity while the opposite was true for actual wec the smallest value of actual wec for tn was 150 t in june and a negative value also occurred in june for tp this is because nps pollution discharge was more sensitive to rainfall and flow change than the ideal wec compared to phosphorus the wec of nitrogen was more affected by the hydrological and nps pollution discharge conditions in addition the wec of nitrogen and phosphorus in organic species was more affected by seasonal change than that of nitrogen and phosphorus in inorganic species spatially the channels in the middle and southeast of the study area had the smallest actual wec and even negative values were observed the results of remnant wec showed that the smallest value occurred in july and june with values of 800 t and 140 t for tn and tp respectively thus significant attention should be paid to controlling nps pollution during the wet season and organic nitrogen and phosphorus should be set as the priority pollutants to control furthermore controlling the nps pollution discharge and enhancing the wec should be carried out simultaneously compared to previously used methods the calculation method employed in this study had the ability to simulate the transformation and interaction between nitrogen and phosphorus in organic and inorganic species and better considered dynamic changes in the input conditions keywords water environmental capacity non point source pollution temporal spatial analysis swat model differential evolution algorithm 1 introduction the source of pollutants discharged into the water can be classified into point source and non point source nps over the past few decades point source pollution has been effectively controlled while controlling nps pollution still presents significant challenges abdulkareem et al 2018 xu et al 2018 compared to point source pollution nps pollution has complex characteristics and great uncertainty de oliveira et al 2017 nitrogen and phosphorus contamination were the major components of nps pollution and can result in the eutrophication of water bodies as the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water is drastically reduced this leads to the death of aquatic animal and can finally threaten human health xu et al 2016 faust et al 2018 thus effectively controlling nps pollution to improve water quality has received research focus of late total quantity control has been widely used to control water contamination guan et al 2016 yu and lu 2018 and a key aspect of total quantity control studies is to improve the simulation accuracy of determining the amount of pollutants that can be discharged into a water column qin et al 2015 to improve water quality large number of studies have been conducted on controlling the discharge of nps pollution best management practices bmps are the most commonly used measures and include both engineering and non engineering measures ahn and kim 2016 li et al 2017 song et al 2017 the effects of combining different bmps on nps pollution control and the optimization of the spatial allocation of bmps have been widely studied ciou et al 2012 wu et al 2018 before implementing the bmps the limit for pollutant discharges into a given water channel should be confirmed zhang 2003 this concept was explicitly stipulated in the total maximum daily load tmdl provision in the clean water act mcconnell 2017 the water environmental capacity wec indicates the total amount of pollutants that can be discharged into the water volume in tmdl liang et al 2015 calculating the wec before implementing the bmps can effectively and economically improve the water quality xu et al 2013 a great number of studies concerning the wec have been conducted around the world li and zou 2015 zhao et al 2015 peng et al 2016 a basic analytical method was the most commonly adopted method to calculate wec because its use is easy and convenient xie et al 2014 liu et al 2018 the complex degradation of the pollutants and the interaction between different pollutants were generalized into a comprehensive degradation coefficient zhao et al 2015 to improve the calculation accuracy of wec some complex calculation formulas were used in combination with other mathematical methods zhang et al 2012 uncertainty analysis was also performed to analyze the impacts of the temporal change of the inputs on the wec calculation liu et al 2012 chen et al 2014 a geographic information system gis was used to provide a spatial analysis of the wec calculation results han et al 2010 however the current calculation methods do have some disadvantages many factors including water flow degradation coefficient pollutants types and emission method can affect the wec of a channel reghunathan et al 2016 under real conditions the water flow will change with variation in the precipitation and the degradation of the pollutants will be affected by the water temperature and biomass chen et al 2018a however these variables have been set as constants in wec studies hou et al 2016 furthermore most of the current calculations of wec are carried out for point source pollution without much consideration of nps pollution pan et al 2013 peng et al 2016 compared to point source pollution nps pollution varies with changes in the hydrological conditions nsenga kumwimba et al 2018 to better consider the temporal change of hydrological conditions degradation coefficient and nps pollution discharge hydrological water quality models should be used to provide continuous simulation outputs in addition pollutants can transform from one species to another which may have different effects on the water body shultz et al 2018 however interaction and transformation between different pollutants were seldom considered in past wec models li and zou 2015 this hypothesis would cause an overestimation or underestimation of the wec the calculation equations become very complex if the interaction and transformation processes are considered making it impossible for traditional analytical methods to produce accurate results alvarez del castillo romo et al 2018 many studies have found that optimization algorithms have performed satisfactorily when solving complex and non linear problems facci and ubertini 2018 to improve current wec calculation methods an optimization algorithm should be used to solve the complex equations that reflect the interaction between different pollutants in this study considering the interaction of the pollutants and dynamic changes in the input conditions the wec in xiangxi river watershed was analyzed using the soil and water assessment tool swat and the differential evolution de the main goals of this study were to 1 advance a new method to calculate the wec for nps pollution 2 analyze the impacts of dynamic changes in the input data on the wec calculation and 3 discuss the interaction of nutrient pollutants in different species and its effect on the wec calculation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the xiangxi river located between 110 47 to 111 13 e and 30 96 to 31 67 n is an important part of the three gorges reservoir fig 1 it is approximately 94 km long flows through three counties and has a drainage area of approximately 3099 km2 a humid subtropical monsoon climate dominates the climate of the xiangxi river watershed zhang et al 2014 the annual average precipitation is 1213 mm and the average annual temperature is 17 8 c the months of january february march november and december represent the dry season april may september and october represent the normal season and june july and august represent the wet season forest area with a proportion up to 80 dominates the total land use area in the watershed however due to excessive fertilizer application and unreasonable livestock breeding nps contamination is still a serious threat in the watershed wang et al 2018 2 2 the concept of water environmental capacity in this study three kinds of wec were calculated and analyzed ideal wec actual wec and remnant wec these three types showcased different aspects of wec the ideal wec was calculated under the ideal situation which meant the pollutants discharged into the calculated channel from the upstream channels and the corresponding subbasin were not taken into consideration i e the background concentration of the pollutants in the calculated channel was set to zero calculating the ideal wec could show the impacts of hydrological conditions on the dilution and self cleaning capacity of channels the ideal wec was calculated through the combined use of the swat and the de algorithm the actual wec was calculated considering the pollutants coming from the upstream channels under the actual conditions the water coming from the upstream channels would carry some pollution already accounting for some of the wec the actual wec represents the amount of pollution that could potentially be discharged into the channel from the corresponding subbasin by comparing the actual wec to the ideal wec the influence of upstream channels on the wec of the downstream channels can be revealed the actual wec is defined as eq 1 1 we c actual w e c ideal l o a d upstream where we c actual is the actual wec kg d we c ideal is the ideal wec kg d and loa d upstream is the amount of pollution coming from the upstream channels kg d the remnant wec was calculated considering both the pollutants coming from the upstream channels and the corresponding subbasin it represented the amount of pollution that was allowed to be discharged from the corresponding subbasin into the channel under the current discharge situation calculating the remnant wec could provide a reference for pollution management in a specific subbasin under the current pollution conditions the remnant wec was calculated using eq 2 2 we c re m n a n t w e c actual l o a d sub where we c re m n a n t is the remnant wec kg d we c actual is the actual wec kg d and loa d sub is the pollutants coming from the corresponding subbasin kg d to prevent water pollution the remnant wec should be calculated for a typical year for the wec of point source pollution a 90 guarantee rate method has been widely used to select a typical year with a relatively low flow condition zhang et al 2010 in this way a relatively serious pollution condition was considered as the wec of the point source pollution was primarily affected by the flow however this method was not suitable for the wec of nps pollution compared to point source pollution the discharge of nps pollution is significantly influenced by the flow thus for the wec of nps pollution both flow and nps pollution discharge amount should be considered when determining a typical year the actual wec was used as an evaluation criterion to select the typical year which takes both the impact of flow and nps pollution discharge on the wec calculation into consideration a series of years from 2009 to 2016 were sorted by actual wec in descending order and the year exhibited a 90 rate was selected as the typical year 2 3 swat model and differential evolution algorithm the swat is a semi distributed process based and time continuous model that has been widely used to simulate the impact of management on hydrological processes and water quality teshager et al 2017 it was developed by the united states department of agriculture agricultural research service arnold et al 1998 the simulation process can be further divided into a land surface process and a main channel process the equations in qual2e were used to describe the processes of nutrient transformation and degradation in the channel as displayed in the swat model the equations for nitrogen were eqs 3 6 3 δ o r g n str α 1 ρ a a lg a e β n 3 o r g n str σ 4 o r g n str t t 4 δ n h 4 s

the de algorithm a method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution related to a given goal it is an imitation of biological evolution in the real world yao et al 2018 de algorithms have been widely used in many study fields such as multi objective optimization and constrained optimization das and suganthan 2011 das et al 2016 compared to other optimization algorithms such as the genetic algorithm particle swarm algorithm and ant colony algorithm de has proved to be more robust and efficient in continuous encoding optimization zhang et al 2017 hou et al 2018 yang et al 2018 the main calculation processes of the de algorithm include the initialization of the parameter vectors mutation with differential operators and crossover and selection storn and price 1997 in contrast to other evolution algorithms de uses a donor vector to perform the mutation operation eq 9 9 v i t x r 1 i t f x r 2 i t x r 3 i t where v i t is the donor vector x r 1 i t x r 2 i t and x r 3 i t are the randomly picked vectors from the current population f is the mutation index defined by the user in this study the daily outputs of the swat model including the daily stream flow water temperature algal concentration and other factors related to the calculation of wec were used directly as the input of the de algorithm to calculate the wec the input concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen in organic and inorganic species were set as the variables for optimization with the de algorithm the final concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen were set as the objective functions which were calculated using the equations mentioned previously eqs 3 8 the goal of the de algorithm was to allow the final concentration of phosphorus or nitrogen to be as high as possible within the standard concentration limitation 2 4 calibration and validation swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup was used to calibrate the parameters in the swat model the program was developed to analyze the sensitivity and uncertainty of the parameters in the swat model and search for the best combination of the parameters abbaspour 2007 the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 algorithm in swat cup was used as the calibration algorithm as it has been proven to be effective for use in large watersheds rostamian et al 2008 the coefficient of determination r 2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were used as indicators to evaluate the accuracy of the model 2 5 input data and model set up the dem data were downloaded from the second version of the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global digital elevation model dataset with a resolution of 30 m http www gscloud cn the land use data in 2010 were interpreted from the landsat 5 tm dataset the soil data were obtained from the institute of geography chinese academy of sciences the physical and chemical characteristics of the soil in the study area were determined from a field survey and a chinese soil database the meteorological data of nine weather stations in the watershed were obtained from the yichang weather bureau the monitoring data of the daily flow total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn from 2009 to 2016 were collected from the yichang hydrographic office in hubei province china the tn and tp loadings were calculated by multiplying their monitored concentration of tn and tp with the corresponding flow the model was first calibrated using the observed data for the flow tp and tn from 2009 to 2014 and was subsequently validated using data from 2015 to 2016 then the model was run in a daily step to simulate the nps pollution discharge from each subbasin and simultaneously calculate the wecs for each channel the ideal wec was calculated first using the couple of swat model and de algorithm fig 2 then the actual wec and remnant wec were calculated based on the ideal wec using the equations mentioned before the water quality standard of tn and tp for the channels in the study area was set according to the water function zones divided by the government of hubei province two levels of water quality standard were included in this study area level ii standard 0 1 mg l for tp and 0 5 mg l for tn and level iii standard 0 2 mg l for tp and 1 mg l for tn fig 1 because there is no water quality standard of tn for rivers in china the water quality standard of tn for lakes and reservoirs was used as the standard for rivers in this study 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation in this study 21 parameters were selected to calibrate flow and 12 parameters were selected to calibrate tn and tp the calibrated values of all the 33 parameters were listed in table 1 the r 2 of flow tp and tn were all greater than 0 6 and the nse values were all greater than 0 5 during the calibration and validation periods fig 3 the calibration and validation results could be accepted with the r 2 values and the nse values of flow tn and tp larger than 0 5 chen et al 2018b the errors mainly occurred in the simulation of peak flow in which the water yield processes may be complex additionally the values of tn and tp were underestimated to a small extent compared to the observed values this may be caused by the overlooking of some point source discharge in the study area abdelwahab et al 2018 3 2 temporal variation of the water environmental capacity the annual change in the ideal wec indicated that the ideal wec has an obvious relationship with the annual precipitation fig 4 a and b for both nitrogen and phosphorus the higher the precipitation the larger the ideal wec for nitrogen the ideal wec of organic nitrogen was one time less than that of the inorganic nitrogen for phosphorus the ideal wec of organic phosphorus and inorganic phosphorus exhibited almost the same value in each year with the value fluctuating from 250 t to 500 t compared to the ideal wec the annual actual wec was much smaller particularly for organic nitrogen and phosphorus fig 4c and d the smallest actual wec of organic phosphorus occurred in 2015 with a value less than 50 t for organic nitrogen negative values of actual wec even occurred in 2010 2012 2013 2014 and 2016 with the lowest value observed in 2013 at about 2500 t the results of monthly variations in the ideal and actual wec showed that the ideal highest wec of tn occurred in the wet season with values up to 4500 t while the lowest values occurred in the dry season with values less than 1000 t fig 4e the ideal wec of the inorganic nitrogen occupied more than half that of the tn for phosphorus the largest ideal wec occurred in the wet season with values up to 80 t and the lowest value occurred in the dry season with a value less than 30 t fig 4f however the actual wec was quite different from the ideal wec for nitrogen the lowest actual wec was found in the wet season with a value of approximately 150 t in june fig 4g while the actual wec of inorganic nitrogen still had positive value in june the actual wec of organic nitrogen showed a very large negative value of approximately 350 t for phosphorus the actual wec of tp showed positive values for all months except june fig 4h although the actual wec of tp showed positive values in may and july there were not enough wecs for organic phosphorus the daily ideal wec results of tn and tp from 2009 to 2016 were arranged in ascending order with the corresponding subbasin loads fig 5 a the result showed that the ideal wec and subbasin load both had a positive correlation with the precipitation but the rate of change of the subbasin load was faster than that of the ideal wec to quantify the impact of precipitation on the ideal wec and subbasin load fitting curves of precipitation with the ideal wec and precipitation with subbasin load were drawn fig 5b and c the results showed that the relationship between precipitation and the ideal wec or subbasin load was congruous with the quadratic function relation the r 2 values were all larger than 0 5 except the fitting between the precipitation and ideal wec of tp the r 2 of the fitting between the precipitation and subbasin load was larger than that between precipitation and the ideal wec furthermore the quadratic term coefficient of the fitting between precipitation and the subbasin load was larger than that between precipitation and the ideal wec 3 3 spatial distribution of the actual water environmental capacity the spatial distribution of the actual wec showed that more than one fifth of the channels had negative values for actual wec of total nitrogen fig 6 a the lowest value occurred in channel 16 with a value less than 120 t all the channels had enough actual wec for inorganic nitrogen except channel 12 and 16 and the subbasin loads were smaller than the actual wec in most of the channels fig 6b about half of the channels had negative values for the actual wec of organic nitrogen and the subbasin loads all exceeded the actual wec in the corresponding channels fig 6c for phosphorus all the channels had positive values for actual wec of tp except channel 22 fig 6d the values were much larger than the corresponding subbasin loads at the downstream channels but much smaller at the upstream and midstream channels all the channels had positive values for the actual wec of inorganic phosphorus fig 6e while several channels mainly located in the southeast of the watershed had negative values for that of organic phosphorus fig 6f the actual wec of nitrogen was more affected by seasonal change than that of phosphorus particularly for the channels in the middle and southeast of the watershed fig 7 a and d in most of the channels the variations of the actual wec across different seasons showed that for both nitrogen and phosphorus in inorganic species the actual wec had a descending order wet normal dry fig 7b and e some negative values even occurred in the dry season for inorganic nitrogen the channels near the outlet of the watershed had larger wec values than the others in contrast for phosphorus and nitrogen in organic species most of the channels had negative values for actual wec in the wet season while all the channels had positive wec values in the dry season fig 7c and f 3 4 evaluation of the remnant water environmental capacity in this study 2012 which exhibited a relatively small actual wec that indicates relatively serious contamination was selected as the typical year table 2 the results showed that july had the smallest remnant wec for tn with a value of up to 800 t fig 8 a in which the wec for inorganic and organic nitrogen was 100 t and 900 t respectively july had the largest subbasin load with value of 100 t 400 t and 500 t for inorganic nitrogen organic nitrogen and total nitrogen respectively for phosphorus negative values of remnant wec occurred in the wet season fig 8b june had the smallest values of about 40 t 100 t and 140 t for inorganic organic and tp respectively the subbasin loads were 50 t 100 t and 150 t for inorganic organic and tp respectively spatially the variation of nitrogen and phosphorus was different fig 9 a for nitrogen most of the channels had negative values for the remnant wec of organic nitrogen and channel 16 had the smallest value of up to 125 t while most of the channels had positive values for the remnant wec of inorganic nitrogen no remnant wec existed for inorganic phosphorus in most of the channels however in the channels near the outlet of the watershed an abundance of remnant wec existed the seasonal change had significant effects on the variation of remnant wec the negative wec values of tn and tp occurred in the wet season fig 9b some negative values occurred in the dry season for inorganic nitrogen and most of the channels had negative values for inorganic phosphorus fig 9c for organic nitrogen and phosphorus almost all the channels had negative wec values across all seasons particularly in the wet season fig 9d 4 discussion the temporal change of the ideal wec was significantly affected by precipitation change because the dilution capacity was based on the water volume in the channel the more water in the channel the more pollutants that can be discharged into the channel zhang et al 2012 however in some months the ideal wec was large with a relatively low amount of precipitation this could be explained by the fact that the temperature was high in these months leading to a large degradation coefficient that improved the self cleaning capacity of the water volume borah et al 2006 the transformation between different species of nitrogen included organic nitrogen to inorganic nitrogen algal nitrogen to organic nitrogen and inorganic nitrogen to algal nitrogen yi et al 2017 the larger ideal wec of inorganic nitrogen than that of the organic nitrogen indicated that the transformation from organic nitrogen to inorganic nitrogen was weak in the channels of the study area and that the transformation from algal nitrogen to organic nitrogen may be active due to the eutrophication in the study area wang et al 2018 the results of the actual wec showed that the nps pollution in the area was already serious the negative values mainly occurred in the years with large rainfall because water and soil erosion are enhanced under these conditions and lead to the discharge of a large amount of pollution into the channels kinnell 2017 furthermore although negative values mainly occurred in the wet season the highest values of ideal wec were also observed in the wet season this is explained by the fact that although the large flow volume in the channel improved the ideal wec the discharge of nps pollutants also increased shen et al 2014 the smaller quadratic term coefficient of the fitting curve observed between precipitation and the ideal wec compared to that of precipitation and the subbasin load indicated that the increasing trend of subbasin load was faster than that of the ideal wec with an increase of precipitation i e the subbasin load was more affected by hydrological conditions than the ideal wec thus contrary to the actual wec of point source pollution the actual wec of nps pollution becomes even smaller under large flow conditions under this phenomenon selecting a typical year based only on the small flow was not feasible for the wec calculation of nps pollution the actual wec should be used as the criterion for selecting the typical year as it takes the impact of flow and nps pollution discharge on wec into consideration seasonal change had a more obvious effects on the actual wec of nitrogen than that of phosphorus because the nitrogen pollution was the main nps contamination in the study area due to the excessive use of nitrogen fertilizer song et al 2016 liu et al 2017 the actual wec of organic nitrogen and phosphorus was affected more by seasonal change than that of the inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus indicating that the loss of organic nitrogen and phosphorus was more affected by precipitation than that of the inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus in this area this is reasonable because in contrast to inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus the nitrogen and phosphorus in organic species are mainly adsorbed to the sediment king et al 2015 thus when the rainfall was low it was relatively hard for the sediment to be transported with the water into the channel under this condition the loss of nitrogen and phosphorus occurred primarily in the inorganic species the actual wec of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus was larger than the subbasin load in most of the channels indicating that the loss of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus in the watershed was acceptable for organic nitrogen and phosphorus the subbasin load should be reduced especially in the middle and southeast of the watershed where farming activities are intensive liu et al 2016 the negative values of the actual wec indicated that excess pollutants were discharged into the channel from upstream channels thus controlling nps contamination in the upstream channels should be pursued before the management of the downstream channels the results of the remnant wec indicated that more attention should be paid to the control of nps pollution discharge in the wet season especially for organic nitrogen and phosphorus however the subbasin load of organic phosphorus was relatively small fig 8b this phenomenon indicated that to control the phosphorus contamination in the watershed only reducing the discharge of organic phosphorus is not enough more efforts should be made to enhance the wec in the channels such as increasing the water retention time enhancing the bioactivity of the microorganisms in the channels and changing the physical characteristics of the channels etc liu et al 2013 davis et al 2015 mahl et al 2015 furthermore an abundance of remnant wec existed in the channels near the outlet of the watershed due to the large flow volume and complex redox condition in those areas braskerud et al 2005 5 conclusions this study was the first attempt to use the swat model and de algorithm to dynamically analyze the wec of nps pollution on the watershed scale this method fully utilized the outputs of the swat model and took temporal variation in the calculation parameters into consideration what s more wec of nitrogen and phosphorus in organic and inorganic species was calculated separately instead of only considering tn and tp revealing the transformation and interaction between nitrogen and phosphorus in organic and inorganic species the ideal wec results showed that the hydrological conditions especially the flow had significant effect on the acceptable pollutants capacity of the channels the actual wec was much smaller than the ideal wec which indicated that the pollutant discharge of the upstream channels had greatly influenced the wec of the downstream channels thus it is important to balance the relationship between upstream and downstream the remnant wec results showed that the reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus discharge into water from nps is extremely urgent the results showed that control of nps pollution discharge in wet the season is of great importance although the ideal wec was large in the wet season nps contamination was also serious the rate of increase in nps pollution discharge was larger than that of the ideal wec additionally the spatial distribution of the wec was not uniform there was no remnant wec left in the middle and southeast of the watershed while abundant wec existed in the channels near the outlet of the watershed separate management of the organic and inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus should be used instead of a combined management of tn and tp because the wec of tn and tp showed positive values negative values may occur for inorganic or organic nitrogen and phosphorus compared to inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus more attention should be paid to the management of organic nitrogen and phosphorus the wec of organic nitrogen and phosphorus was generally smaller than that of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus and was more affected by seasonal change controlling the discharge of nps pollution and increasing the wec of the channels should be carried out simultaneously however some channels did not receive much pollutant discharge and thus continuing to attempt to further reduce nps pollution discharge may be difficult and inefficient focusing efforts on increasing the wec to allow more pollutants to be discharged into the channels may be more efficient acknowledgments this study was funded by the national natural science foundation of china

6753,the goal of this study is to analyze fluid geochemistry boron isotope and gas data to reassess the formation and evolution processes of the changbaishan volcanic geothermal system jilin china due to the presence of hot fumaroles with temperatures of higher than 100 c and sinters we believe that phase separation is occurring underground which is also indicated by the characteristics of the b and gas data based on their hydrochemical data and b cl ratios the thermal water samples in this area can be divided into three groups 1 group 1 is steam heated condensate water group 1 1 jj jlq group 1 2 sbdg xrq 2 group 2 is karst water cr3 and lsd and 3 group 3 is residual water cr1 and cr2 the preliminary discrimination of samples using b and gas data implies that group 1 1 around the crater is controlled by a second phase separation process which is induced by the input of hot magmatic material group 1 2 in the basin area is controlled by the transformation of clay minerals and the xrq water sample shows contamination by sewage group 2 represents karst water that has leached metamorphic rock and been directly heated by the input of hot magmatic volatiles and group 3 is the result of one seawater phase separation process the mixing and fluid rock interaction models based on the mass balance of boron concentration and isotope imply that the phase separation and input of magmatic volatiles are more important than fluid rock interactions in the formation of the changbaishan geothermal system and the first phase separation process in the deep carbonate reservoir occurred in a late stage with approximately 75 87 5 of water becoming vapor additionally the rayleigh distillation of b isotope implies that new magma is being generated below this area with the low b concentrations and high boron isotopic values of its gases implying that the mixed component may be derived from the subducted pacific plate e g marine sediment the addition of excess heat due to the continued subduction of the pacific plate has further encouraged the phase separation process and the subduction process has also accelerated the transition of the hydrothermal system into a non hydrothermal system keywords volcanic geothermal system thermal water boron isotopes phase separation magmatic volatiles fluid rock interaction 1 introduction the formation of natural geothermal activity in a volcanic area is generally affected by 1 phase separation 2 magmatic volatile input 3 fluid rock interaction and 4 later mixing processes arnórsson et al 2007 ingebritsen and sorey 1988 scot et al 2014 seyfried et al 1984 stefánsson et al 2017 white et al 1971 however these processes control the distribution and physical state of thermal water and lead to thermal waters with high concentrations of certain elements which may be beneficial or harmful to human health ellis and mahon 1964 freeze and cherry 1979 wang et al 2016 white 1957 zhao et al 2018a therefore research on the formation and evolution of geothermal systems is significant not only for understanding the origin boundary conditions and chemical processes operating along the flow within the aquifer but also for the exploration of thermal water and or the future utilization of geothermal resources arnórsson et al 2007 purnomo et al 2016 stefánsson et al 2017 white et al 1971 zhao et al 2018b the potential utility of boron is mainly based on the preference of each b isotope for a different coordination state i e tetrahedral coordination for 10b and trigonal coordination for 11b which is ph dependent and its phase separation characteristics at different t p x conditions bischoff and rosenbauer 1984 foustoukos and seyfried 2007 muttik et al 2011 palmer and swihart 1996 zeebe 2005 the boron isotopic signatures of continental waters span an extremely wide range from 27 to 75 pennisi et al 2006 xiao et al 2013 in hydrothermal fluids the δ11b values mainly vary from 10 5 to 54 9 aggarwal et al 2000 vengosh et al 1991 1994b the approximate ranges of δ11b values in different geochemical reservoirs are 9 7 to 6 8 for granites and fresh oceanic basalts 2 to 14 for altered oceanic basalts ishikawa and nakamura 1993 vengosh et al 1994a xiao et al 2013 1 5 to 6 5 for volcanic gases kanzaki et al 1979 12 to 58 for marine boron 32 to 26 for non marine boron 17 to 2 for igneous rocks and 34 to 22 for metamorphic rocks vengosh et al 1994a xiao et al 2013 yuan et al 2014 these geochemical characteristics make boron an excellent tracer for modeling geochemical cycles and determining different sources in fluid meditated and fluid dominated processes in geothermal systems boron isotopes are widely used to decipher the secondary clay mineral compositions and flow paths during fluid rock interactions with igneous rocks and sediments boschetti et al 2015 hervig et al 2002 keren and mezuman 1981 muttik et al 2011 wunder et al 2005 boron isotopes have also been successfully employed to describe the input of magmatic volatiles and mixing processes using the distinctive boron signatures of different water end members aggarwal et al 2000 arnórsson et al 2007 zhang et al 2015b due to its more volatile characteristics with the almost linear covariation of b cl with 1 cl observed in laboratory liquid vapor phase separation experiments the b cl ratio can be used to discern the phase separation processes in geothermal systems arnórsson and andrésdóttir 1995 bischoff and rosenbauer 1987 wu et al 2016 you et al 1994 moreover the high b cl ratios observed in discharging waters were attributed to the input of a b enriched component and used as a proxy for co2 cl to trace the addition of magmatic components giggenbach 1995 wu et al 2016 boron and its isotopic fractionation are associated with vapor liquid separation in thermal waters whereby 11b partitions selectively into the vapor phase leeman et al 1992 liebscher et al 2005 spivack et al 1990 empirical and experimental data indicate that in a closed system vapor liquid separation of b is weak whereas in an open system it will be partitioned into the vapor at temperatures of greater than 400 c purnomo et al 2016 liebscher et al 2005 truesdell et al 1989 thus the δ11bvapor liquid values are small ranging from 3 to 1 at 140 to 300 c leeman et al 1992 and at temperatures of greater than 300 c the δ11bvapor liquid values are negligible kanzaki et al 1979 nomura et al 1982 purnomo et al 2016 spivack et al 1990 leeman et al 1992 yuan et al 2014 zeebe 2005 the vapor liquid fractionation of boron depends on the system behavior open or closed which is conditioned by a t p x factor and boron isotope fractionation is not sensitive in high temperature systems thus phase separation processes can mainly be discriminated based on the b cl ratio and this process can be quantitatively described using the well established phase relations in the nacl h2o system bischoff and rosenbauer 1984 liebscher et al 2005 but little attention has been paid to the use of boron isotopes in this process leeman et al 2005 spivack et al 1990 zeebe 2005 the boron isotopes of near surface water mainly approach those of the rocks that they weather muttik et al 2011 rose koga et al 2006 while in deep water boron isotope values are temperature dependent and reach equilibrium with the host rock palmer et al 1987 leeman et al 2005 zhang et al 2015b if a continuous vapor liquid separation process exists isotope equilibrium will be broken and its value will decrease over time in an open system as 11b continues to partition into the vapor phase leeman et al 2005 palmer et al 1987 spivack et al 1990 therefore on this occasion the phase separation process can be quantitatively assessed using the δ11b value especially when the temperature is below 400 c in addition boron isotopes are not expected to fractionate significantly at magmatic temperatures 700 1250 c thus they can also record valuable information about deep fluid related processes muttik et al 2011 you et al 1994 1996 the changbaishan or mt baekdu volcanic geothermal system cgs is located in a convergent plate boundary back arc geothermal system that features many hydrothermal phenomena such as fumaroles and hot springs which are related to magmatic activity lin et al 1999 shangguan et al 1997 the fumaroles are distributed both in the crater and its periphery but high temperature fumaroles 115 c boiling point is 90 c at 2700 m in the changbaishan area 0 7 bar abs and spring pools 82 c are distributed around the crater and temperatures ranging from 21 c to 53 5 c are mainly found outside the crater the thermal water activity is always accompanied by intense gas release which mainly comes from the mantle based on its carbon and helium isotope data shangguan et al 1996 shangguan et al 1997 wei et al 2013 zhang et al 2015a the geothermal system is mainly recharged by precipitation with a high residence time higher than 62 years according to its t values lin et al 1999 yan 2016 and the deepest reservoir temperatures range from 237 c to 327 c shangguan et al 1996 however the δ18o and δd values of the thermal water are lower than those of the local precipitation changbaishan is the highest mountain in east china and its maximum elevation is 2744 m using the water balance approach chen and wang 2012 and jiang and chen 2015 discovered another water recharge source to this area which is the tibetan plateau the tibetan plateau is located in west china and changbaishan is located in east china there are many n e suture lines and the stress shows n w characteristics zhang et al 2016 thus we believe that there may be another factor controlling the hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics of the thermal water in the changbaishan area e g vapor liquid separation high temperature fumaroles are the dominant feature in the occurrence of vapor liquid separation ingebritsen and sorey 1988 white et al 1971 the discovery of high chlorine water in newly drilled wells at low elevations has led the cgs to be defined as a vapor dominant geothermal system which is categorized based on the major chemical composition and origin of surface geothermal fluids arnórsson et al 2007 fournier 1989 giggenbach 1988 kaasalainen and stefánsson 2012 valentio and stanzione 2003 nordstrom et al 2009 this new discovery provides us with an opportunity to further study the formation process of the cgs the present study was designed to use b concentration and isotopic composition data combined with gas and other chemical and isotopic data to reassess the formation and evolution processes of the cgs the vapor liquid separation and magmatic volatile input processes in this system are clearly implied by the b concentration and isotope and gas characteristics the results accentuate the need to reassess the existing models of the cgs which has broad implications for similar systems worldwide 2 geological setting the cgs is located on the northern margin of the north china platform and is the result of cenozoic volcanism in response to the subduction of the pacific plate beneath the eurasian plate and the continental rift system of the northeastern asian mainland liu et al 2010 zhao et al 2009 fig 1 its northern boundary is the jiapigou lithospheric fault its western boundary is the dunmi lithospheric fault and its southeastern boundary is korea the interior geologic structure is controlled by the ne sw trending yalujiang lithospheric fault which formed due to the collision of the longgang area with the helong area fig 1b changbaishan is a polygenetic volcanic edifice in the back arc region and its volcanism began at 5 ma researchers have identified five major eruption cycles in this area and the peak eruption of the latest eruption cycle occurred approximately 1000 years ago which is referred to as the millennium eruption liu et al 1997 liu et al 2015 shi et al 2005 xu et al 1993 eruptions were still occurring until 1903 xu et al 1993 the magma chamber has become shallower moving from depths of 38 65 km in 1996 guo et al 1996 to depths of 7 17 km in 2014 qiu et al 2014 similar to the crater area along the yalujiang lithospheric fault there are many obvious gravity anomalies in this area fig 1c these gravity anomalies may imply that there is another area of the rising sub mantle plume that the heat source is a major magmatic intrusion under the crater area and that the complex of minor intrusions at the periphery also contributes to the heat source the primary rocks around the crater area are gray comendite fallout and pyroclastic flow deposits 95 vol which are covered by dark trachyte pumice pyroclastic flow deposits 5 vol shi et al 2005 outside the crater area there are some exposures of precambrian granite and metamorphic rock mainly marble ordovician limestone and jurassic and cretaceous clastic rocks all of which are covered by extensive neogene basalts with thicknesses varying from 5 to 1500 m fig 1b d the geothermal reservoirs have been certified to comprise igneous fractures mesozoic sandstone rock and paleozoic carbonate rock based on deep drilling data yan et al 2016 although the magma pocket has become shallower over time no increase in spring water temperature has been detected this characteristic may imply that the vapor liquid phase separation taking place in the reservoir buffered the input of excess heat to the shallower magma pocket henley and hughes 2000 nuccio et al 1999 changbaishan is the highest mountain that also has rivers and lakes in northeast china the terrain is high in the southeast and low in the northwest and it comprises a northeast mountain chain and intermountain basin yan 2016 the tianchi which has a total storage capacity of 20 04 109 m3 zhu et al 1981 is the source of many large rivers such as the songhuajiang tumenjiang and yalujiang rivers the changbaishan area features a continental monsoonal climate with four distinct seasons however winter lasts a long time and the average snow cover duration is greater than 170 days with an annual mean temperature ranging from 2 c to 6 c according to the geological environment monitoring station of jilin province 2004 the annual mean precipitation is 1332 6 mm and the average annual evaporation is 1180 mm furthermore a brief geothermal circulation model of a liquid dominated system has been established based on 2h 18o and t data yan 2016 3 materials and analytical methods the following samples were collected from the cgs in july 2017 seven samples from hot springs three samples from cold springs and three samples from wells in addition to two crater water samples and two gas samples see sampling locations in fig 1 the jj and jlq water samples were collected from around the crater jj was collected on the south slope while jlq was collected on the north slope other samples were collected from the southern and western peripheries of the crater the two crater water samples were collected from the same crater tianchi crater but hb was sampled in a location where there was more gas generation compared to that observed at the tc sample location the temperature and ph data were measured in the field and the alkalinity hco3 and co3 2 data were determined by gran titration in the laboratory on the sampling day water samples were filtered using 0 45 μm membrane filters and stored in clean polyvinyl fluoride bottles that were sealed with wax samples used for major and trace element analyses were acidified with concentrated hno3 0 5 ml 1 ml and 100 ml samples and analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes optima 2100 dv which has a lower limit of 0 01 mg l2 1 and ion chromatography ic which has a lower limit of 0 01 mg l 1 respectively at the jilin university test center china the precision of the major ion contents determined using the ic and icp oes analyses is less than 5 the water samples used for the analysis of δ11b were collected in polyethylene bottles the stable isotope compositions of dissolved boron were determined using an mc icp ms neptune plus thermoscientific the repeatability of the mc icp ms procedure exhibited a standard deviation 2σ of greater than 0 5 the boron isotope compositions are reported in with respect to the nist srm 951 standard this analysis was performed at the aoshi isotopic laboratory in guangdong china the water samples collected for the analysis of tdic values were collected in polyethylene bottles using naoh and ba oh 2 to obtain baco3 halas and wolacewicz 1982 the tdic values were determined using a multiflow isoprime 100 with a precision of less than 0 2 carbon isotope compositions are reported in with respect to the pdb standard this analysis was performed at the jilin university stable isotope research center a pre evacuation sampling method was used to collect gases from wells a funnel was submerged into a water channel and placed on top of bubbling sites to collect gases the air trapped in pipes was pumped completely out using a hand pump to prevent air contamination and at least 5 min was spent on the air pumping procedure when the funnel was filled with gases the pre evacuated aluminum foil bag piston was opened then the accumulated volcanic gases in the funnel were pumped into the sampling bag the detailed pre evacuation sampling procedure can be found in fu et al 2005 the chemical and isotopic compositions of the gas samples were determined at the key laboratory of petroleum resources research institute of daqing exploration development research heilongjiang china all samples were analyzed for their chemical compositions using a mat 271 mass spectrometer carbon isotope compositions were analyzed using a gc c irms system consisting of a trace gc ultra gas chromatograph gc coupled to a finnigan mat 253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms via a finnigan gc combustion iii interface the routine precisions determined for the elemental abundances and isotopic compositions are 5 and 0 2 respectively 4 results 4 1 chemical and isotopic compositions of water the thermal water is dominantly neutral 6 2 7 7 table 1 sodium bicarbonate water which is accompanied by some secondary water facies fig 2 it is immature to partially equilibrate in k na mg diagrams and exhibits origins from three different reservoirs fig 3 the ion concentrations of two wells cr1 and cr2 which are an order of magnitude higher than those in the other water samples table 1 as well as the thermal water samples show three different variation tendencies in the schoeller diagram table 1 fig 2 1 group 1 is steam heated condensate water jj jlq sbdg xrq 2 group 2 is karst water cr3 and lsd and 3 group 3 is residual water cr1 and cr2 the existence of hot fumaroles hotter than 100 c li 2015 and different water facies is similar to those observed in volcanic geothermal systems in which phase separation occurs worldwide e g the taupo volcanic geothermal system in new zealand the tacora volcano geothermal system in chile and the lassen volcanic geothermal system in california the δ11b values in the cgs exhibited a wide range from 12 19 to 35 86 however in the same area these values exhibited a narrow variation and the values of cr1 and cr2 are close to that of sea water 40 0 table 1 the δ13cdic values of the hydrothermal waters in changbaishan form two different groups those with values ranging from 1 01 to 1 44 around the crater area and those with values ranging from 19 66 to 15 48 around the periphery area table 1 4 2 chemical and isotopic compositions of gas the gases from the cgs have high co2 84 3 98 6 and low n2 0 26 3 85 contents whereas the sample from the sbdg is dominated by n2 87 52 table 2 and none of the gases contain soluble components e g hcl hf co h2s or so2 single gas geothermometry shows a narrow variation in temperature but these temperatures are apparently higher than those calculated from solution geothermometry fig 3 and assembly gas geothermometry fig 3 table 3 this characteristic has been verified to be the result of phase separation arnórsson et al 2007 the reservoir temperatures fall within two ranges the crater temperatures range from 202 7 c to 238 3 c and the periphery temperatures range from 282 1 c to 290 0 c similar to the results calculated by shangguan et al 1996 even though the δ13cdic values of the cgs show wide variations table 1 except for that of the sbdg 12 30 the δ13cco2 values mainly fall within a narrow range 7 4 to 5 33 which are consistent with upper mantle values 6 5 2 5 pineau and javoy 1983 and those reported for arc related volcanic gases 9 8 to 1 3 marty et al 1989 varekamp et al 1992 zhang et al 2015a 5 discussion 5 1 preliminary discrimination of the controlling processes of the cgs 5 1 1 inferences from b cl decoupling generally chlorine is a conservative element below 160 c truesdell et al 1989 however the hcl concentration of a vapor in equilibrium with a solution increases as the solution temperature and chlorinity increase and the hcl concentration decreases as the solution ph increases at high temperatures ellis and mahon 1977 truesdell et al 1989 white and truesdell 1970 thus chlorine and boron data in geothermal systems have commonly been used to define the compositions of fluid within the aquifer as well as the origin physicochemical processes and mixing of fluids between reservoirs within a system aggarwal et al 2000 arnórsson and andrésdóttir 1995 similar to the division of hydrochemical characteristics three types of springs can also be clearly distinguished as shown in fig 4 1 those with cl b ratios slightly lower than those of average volcanic rock water group 1 2 those with water with low cl b ratios group 2 and 3 those with water with extremely high cl b ratios group 3 whose values are higher than that of seawater the formation of low cl b water is likely due to the input of a low cl b component such as early magmatic volatiles or phase separation arnórsson and andrésdóttir 1995 bernard et al 2011 valentio and stanzione 2003 unlike crater water sample hb group 2 samples show the obvious input of an hcl component fig 4 which may be due to the direct input of volcanic gas truesdell et al 1989 white and truesdell 1970 this difference can also be seen in fig 5 b the input of magmatic volatiles may lead to a lower na cl ratio due to the input of cl as hcl0 in contrast na and cl show similar behaviors during vapor liquid separation whereas b is more volatile aggarwal et al 2000 thus the lack of correlation between na cl and temperature in group 1 further indicates that these waters underwent a phase separation process while the group 2 samples reflect the result of the input of magmatic volatiles additionally the cl b ratios of group 1 1 are slightly lower than those of group 1 2 which exhibits an origin from different reservoirs fig 3 this may be related to a second phase separation process in group 1 1 which occurred due to the input of hot magmatic volatiles as the δ13cco2 and tdic values of these samples fall within the ranges of upper mantle values 6 5 2 5 pineau and javoy 1983 and volcanic gas values 9 8 to 1 3 marty et al 1989 varekamp et al 1992 zhang et al 2015a the fact that the cl b ratio of group 1 is slightly lower than the average volcanic rock value also implies that fluid rock interaction is not the main mechanism controlling the hydrochemical composition of this thermal water the extremely high cl b ratios of group 3 ranging from 12 714 to 13160 which are three orders of magnitude higher than those of the highest liquid dominated geothermal system cl b 50 bernard et al 2011 and even higher than that of seawater cl b 4318 oi et al 1996 may be related to the phase separation process of seawater as the highest volcanic gas condensates usually have cl b ratios ranging from 120 30 to 650 100 and evaporation processes cause little change in their relative amounts arnórsson and andrésdóttir 1995 bernard et al 2011 these two factors can be excluded 5 1 2 inference from boron isotopic data the δ11b values span a wide range from 12 19 to 35 86 in the cgs however three different groups of thermal water can also be seen with δ11b values ranging from 8 47 to 8 59 in group 1 13 31 to 6 11 in group 2 and 35 26 to 35 86 in group 3 table 1 due to the input of gas hb has a higher δ11b value and b concentration than tc table 2 fumarole gases from active volcanoes always have high b concentrations 94 542 ppm and high δ11b values 2 32 8 25 kanzaki et al 1979 leeman et al 2005 the δ11b values of gases are controlled by the parent source such as melting rocks fluid in which phase separation has occurred and the length of time over which these processes occur thus these δ11b values will span an even wider range than those obtained by kanzaki et al 1979 and leeman et al 2005 e g 12 5 tibetan hydrothermal system zhang et al 2015b if 7 08 is considered to be the minimum δ11b value of gas in the tc crater and the average vapor liquid separation temperature is 220 5 c according to the experiments performed by leeman et al 1992 and palmer et al 1992 a conservative vapor liquid fractionation factor can be suggested 1 2 then the δ11b value of the fluid can be calculated 8 28 this value falls within those observed in group 1 1 8 47 to 7 81 which implies that these springs have undergone a second vapor liquid separation due to the input of hot magmatic volatiles this conclusion can also be observed in the cl vs b diagram fig 4 where the cl b ratio of group 1 1 is lower than that of group 1 2 as the fractionation of b into the steam phase occurs more easily than that of cl in a neutral environment bernard et al 2011 the group 1 2 8 59 and 2 86 xrq and sbdg respectively water samples were collected from the basin area and their δ11b values indicate the control of clay minerals fig 6 the clay desorption effect involves no chloride release chao and you 2006 and during burial from the surface to the diagenesis metamorphism boundary the contribution of boron from clay minerals switches from a desorption interlayer source to a crystal source the range of boundary values is extreme as they range from 10 to 10 and are controlled by the evolution of smectite to illite boschetti et al 2015 the higher δ11b values of xrq compared with those of sbdg may be due to contamination fig 6 and or late stage diagenesis which controls the transformation from smectite to illite fig 6 the springs of group 2 are located in a bedrock area along the yalujiang lithospheric fault and have similar ion variation tendencies fig 2 their ion concentrations are extremely low compared with those of other spring samples and are characteristic of the direct input of magmatic volatiles fig 4 thus we believe that the formation of these springs may be due to the lateral migration of karst water heated by magmatic volatiles the input of magmatic volatiles is extremely obvious in well cr3 which records higher boron concentrations table 2 however the δ11b value 6 11 of cr3 is very similar to that of karst water 6 22 which implies that the δ11b values of magmatic volatiles may be approximately the same as the xrd value the extremely low δ11b value of lsd 13 31 may be a result of metamorphic rock leaching the lsd spring is exposed in metamorphic rock as the δ11b values of a rock decrease during progressive metamorphism romer and meixner 2014 xiao et al 2003 the main mechanisms that produce the heaviest δ11b values in thermal water are as follows 1 mixing with heavy δ11b water e g seawater or deep saline brine resulting from evaporation 2 late stage evaporation at the surface e g halite precipitation stage purnomo et al 2016 and 3 fluid rock interaction e g the fractionation of heavy δ11b rock at low temperatures during evaporation as 10b is adsorbed into minerals boschetti et al 2015 the water becomes enriched in 11b and a maximum enrichment of 30 has been reported by vengosh et al 1992 however this process requires continuous evaporation in the surface environment this has not been found in the changbaishan area and can thus be excluded which is consistent with the observed cl b characteristics large boron deposits are developed on the northern margin of the north china plate which are mainly distributed in volcanic rock and marble and exhibit wide variations in their δ11b isotope values ranging from 2 3 to 17 4 li 2009 xiao et al 2003 furthermore the formation mechanism of boron deposits is mainly attributed to deep brine which is the result of the vapor liquid separation of a seafloor hydrothermal system li 2009 xiao et al 2003 shangguan et al 1997 used the carbon isotope fractionation between co2 and ch4 and estimated the temperature of the deep reservoir to be approximately 327 c the fluid rock 11b fractionation at 350 c is 6 53 at 200 mpa and 8 41 at 50 mpa palmer et al 1992 which implies that the fluid rock equilibrium mechanism cannot explain the high δ11b values and low b concentrations observed at cr1 and cr2 additionally halite strata are undeveloped in the changbaishan area thus the heaviest δ11b value of high cl water may be related to a seawater intrusion or the presence of paleo seawater that has undergone phase separation 5 1 3 inferences from gases the gases from spring pools and wells in the cgs are representative of typical mantle origins fig 7 a li 2015 but these gases show the characteristics of re equilibration with a shallow reservoir rather than being derived directly from magma degassing because none of the gases contain soluble gas indicative of magma degassing e g hcl hf and h2s leeman et al 2005 purnomo et al 2016 scot et al 2014 the formation of the cgs is related to the subduction of the pacific plate thus zhang et al 2015a based on the c he isotopic coupling characteristics of gases assessed the proportions of the contributions of gas from three end members 25 from the upper mantle 11 from subducted sediments and 65 from slab carbonate and proposed that the co2 rich volcanic gases released by changbaishan volcano may have originated from the stagnant subducted pacific slab in the mantle transition zone fig 7b the δ13cco2 values may be altered by gas water interactions during ascent in the exsolution process in contrast to the tdic values of water the δ13cco2 values of gas will decrease with increasing fractionation e g δ13cdic co2 0 996 at 200 c capasso et al 1997 mook et al 1974 which implies that the δ13cco2 value of input gas may be even heavier the δ13cco2 values of cr1 and cr2 are similar to the those of gas in the crater area table 2 which fall within the ranges of upper mantle values 6 5 2 5 pineau and javoy 1983 and arc related volcanic gas values 9 8 to 1 3 marty et al 1989 varekamp et al 1992 zhang et al 2015a thus we speculate that they may have similar origin sources which is consistent with the co2 he ratio results table 2 in addition gas water interaction will only slightly alter the δ13cco2 value if there is a large co2 discharge capasso et al 1997 zhang et al 2015a this characteristic can also be seen in the δ11b values in which the springs of group 1 are the result of condensation of deep high δ11b vapor however the initial character has been covered by the large amount of magmatic volatile input additionally the tdic value of the sbdg is lower than those of wells which have been shown to contaminate mantle origin co2 by organic matter during exsolution li 2015 zhang et al 2015a this may be due to its low co2 content compared to those of the cr1 and cr2 areas as the tdic value will increase with continued co2 exsolution capasso et al 1997 the temperatures calculated by gas geothermometry range from 202 7 c to 290 0 c table 3 because h2 is strongly affected by changes in temperature redox conditions and pressure its concentration will decrease during its ascent to the surface janik and mclaren 2010 giggenbach 1987 thus the actual temperature of the vapor liquid separation will be higher generally geothermal vapor discharges from systems of 280 c generally do not contain co giggenbach 1992 but are found in gases from high temperature vapor dominated systems d amore 1992 this implies that the phase separation temperature in the cgs is not very high or that multiple phase separation events occurred which altered the up rising gas composition to result in the boron and isotopic characteristics described above additionally the influence of the input of vast deep gases on the b concentration and isotopic values can also be seen in the b vs hco3 and δ11b vs hco3 diagrams fig 8 this implies that the influence of gas input is stronger than that of fluid rock interaction in the cgs as the latter will create a native correlation between those members thus the input of co2 can cause a decrease in the ph values of the geothermal waters and the ph variation induced conversion of b oh 4 to b oh 3 will result in the preferential desorption of 10b rich b oh 4 from the solid phase thus reducing the δ11b values of the geothermal waters boschetti et al 2015 muttik et al 2011 5 2 constraints on the compositions of geochemical end members previous analyses of thermal water and gas data from the cgs revealed that the chemical compositions of water contribute to the following factors 1 near surface water precipitation 2 seawater 3 magmatic volatiles 4 igneous rocks and 5 sediment the final geochemistry of the exposed springs in the cgs is mainly controlled by four processes multiple phase separation boiling mixing fluid rock interactions and magmatic volatile input thus different end members must be constrained before their main controlling processes can be determined a summary of the estimated end members is provided in table 3 the δd and δ18o characteristics indicate that the cold spring water showed similar characteristics as local underground water which is recharged by precipitation rain and snow with δd values ranging from 106 6 to 98 4 and the geochemical composition is controlled by fluid rock interactions with volcanic rock lin et al 1999 yan et al 2015 2016 thus the boron concentrations and isotope compositions of the cold springs may represent near surface water with average values of 0 02 0 003 ppm and 6 2 0 16 respectively which is a main component in mixtures with up rising thermal water the boron isotope compositions of precipitation decrease from the sea to continental areas which can be described by the line δd 2 6 δ11b 133 rose koga et al 2006 and has been shown to be appropriate for china lü et al 2014 then the δ11b values of precipitation can be obtained ranging from 10 2 to 13 3 with an average value of 11 7 2 19 the boron concentration of precipitation indicates that it is a microcomponent with b concentrations mainly ranging from 0 1 to 3 0 ppb jiang 2000 rose koga et al 2006 that in china mainly falls around 1 4 ppb lü et al 2014 which is in accordance with this range because of the difficulty of directly sampling deep brine we hypothesize that the initial seawater was no different than the modern pacific ocean seawater which currently has δ11b values ranging from 38 7 to 40 4 barth 1993 in this study the value of seawater is close to the latter value b 4 4 ppm δ11b 40 oi et al 1996 all of the water samples exhibit the influence of magmatic volatiles figs 8 and 9 and this influence is especially obvious in hb lsd and cr3 figs 4 and 7 the vast input of magmatic volatiles will alter the boron concentration and isotope composition of the water however there is little change in the isotopic composition of cr3 even though there is a large increase in the boron concentration the highest boron value released from the rock is only 1 83 mg l wu et al 1984 compared with the recharge water xrd which implies that the boron in cr3 mainly originates from magma and there is very little contribution from the surrounding rock this value is also consistent with the result calculated considering a second phase separation process thus we regard 6 11 as the magmatic volatile value and its b concentrations range from 2 9 ppm to 10 0 ppm with an average value of 6 5 ppm jiang 2001 conducted systematic studies of the b isotopes in the igneous rocks in the changbaishan area and reported leucogranite δ11b values of 12 7 to 11 9 a mean value of 12 3 0 57 was used in this study to represent the initial δ11b value of the magma because of the negligible fractionation between tourmaline and melt occurring at magmatic temperatures kakihana et al 1977 palmer et al 1992 the b contents of the igneous rock range from 0 5 ppm to 758 8 ppm with an average value of 58 9 143 59 ppm 63 samples unpublished data the granite b concentration is approximately 45 74 ppm 14 samples unpublished data limited boron isotope data in sediment have been reported from the changbaishan area and we used the average modern sediment b 132 ppm δ11b 6 2 composition from wu et al 2016 5 3 modeling the controlling processes of the cgs 5 3 1 phase separation and mixing processes boron concentration and isotope and gas data indicate that multiple phase separations have occurred in the cgs and that the springs mainly represent the result of mixing between vapor residual water and near surface water that has been further altered by the input of magmatic volatiles if the end member compositions boron concentration and isotopic data of leaved liquid and separated vapor at different phase separation stages can be estimated then using a mixing model the phase separation stage of the cgs can be assessed the two solutions a b of the mixing model can be expressed by the following equations 1 b mix b a f b b 1 f 2 δ 11 b mix δ 11 b a b a b mix f δ 11 b b b b b mix 1 f where b and δ11b are the b concentrations and isotopic values of the components a b respectively subscripts a and b refer to solutions a and b respectively the subscript mix refers to the mixing water and f is the fraction of component a the δ11bvapor liquid values range from 3 to 1 at 140 to 300 c leeman et al 1992 and the distribution coefficients of δb cb liquid cb vapor range from 10 to 100 at 100 to 300 c leeman et al 1992 at temperatures of higher than 400 c the δ11bvapor liquid value will be negligible and the δb value will be lower than 2 3 liebscher et al 2005 based on the temperature calculated by the gas geothermometers we obtained a conservative value for the first with δ11bvapor liquid and δb values of 1 0 and 12 respectively and second separation with δ11bvapor liquid and δb values of 1 2 and 33 respectively stages in the cgs the hot thermal water up rising mixture mainly contained near surface water which was recharged by precipitation thus the average b concentration and isotope composition values in cold springs were used as the end member composition table 3 we hypothesize that the vapor expelled from the vapor dominant reservoir is a pulse process e g leeman et al 2005 then based on the mass balance of boron we modeled the separation and mixture processes occurring at different vapor liquid separation stages e g 50 75 87 5 table 4 fig 9 the characteristics of b concentration and isotope in the second phase of separation were mainly controlled by magmatic volatiles which increased the values of b concentration to approximately two orders of magnitude higher than those of the spring itself or even higher thus it is difficult to use the first phase process to assess this separation stage in shallow reservoirs as discussed above the hot spring in the crater area represents the residual water of second phase of separation so the average b concentration and isotope values were used to calculate the vapor composition and model the mixing process table 4 in a mixture of vapor leaved fluid and near surface water mixing trends are apparent on a plot of elemental boron vs δ11b values fig 9 the first phase separation process occurred in a later stage and approximately 75 87 5 of the water in the deep reservoir was evaporated this is consistent with the observed cl b values which increased in the vapor phase with fractionation bernard et al 2011 using the b concentration and isotope data the content of cl in the residual water can also be obtained with an average value of 10346 5 mg l thus the average vapor cl b ratio produced between the initial occurrences of phase separation until now can be calculated approximately 2277 a large cl b ratio implies that vapor liquid separation occurred close to the late stage or that deep seawater has an extremely low ph the distribution coefficient of b kd b between the vapor and liquid phases is roughly temperature dependent while the coefficient of hcl0 kd hcl is a complex function of temperature ph and cl bernard et al 2011 simonson and palmer 1993 tagirov et al 1997 however as the b concentration of the high cl water is extremely low the latter can be excluded group 1 1 is mainly located in the extended line of the mixture of residual water from the second phase separation with near surface water which further verifies the effect of the input of magmatic volatiles as they have similar δ11b values in addition the relatively high b concentrations indicate that these springs are not the products of deep water mixing with near surface water but are the result of multiple phase separation events accompanied by the input of magmatic volatiles which contradicts the suggestions of lin et al 1999 and yan 2016 the data points for group 1 2 do not fall on the mixing line which may be due to other factors that have altered their b concentrations and isotope characteristics such as fluid rock interaction and contamination in particular cr3 is the result of karst water heated by magmatic volatiles other than condensation water this sample is located on the extended line due to its δ11b value as the springs in the crater area are mainly controlled by magmatic volatiles 5 3 2 effects of fluid rock interaction in many low temperature geothermal fields around the world such as those in japan shigeno and abe 1983 and new zealand bernal et al 2014 their hydrochemical characteristics are usually related to fluid rock interactions this process will result in boron concentrations and fluid isotopes that approach the characteristics of their host rock within a narrow range yamaoka et al 2015 zhang et al 2015b in figs 4 and 5 the effects of magmatic volatiles can easily be distinguished in the cgs but it is difficult to define the difference between phase separation and steam heated condensate water fluid rock interactions to discriminate between these two factors we used a fluid rock interaction model assuming chemical equilibrium in a closed system and based on isotope mass balance wu et al 2016 yamaoka et al 2015 zhang et al 2015b a simple isotopic model can be established to estimate the effects of fluid rock interactions wu et al 2016 yamaoka et al 2015 this mass balance equation model can be expressed as follows 3 c f c r i rc j i d b r 4 11 10bf ci r 11 10br i rci f 11 10bf i ci r rci f db r αdb r where c is the b concentration the subscripts r and f refer to rock and fluid respectively the superscript i refers to the initial stage of the fluid rock interaction r is the fluid rock mass ratio db defined by db cr cf is the rock fluid bulk distribution coefficient of boron and the isotopic fractionation factor of boron α is defined by α δ 11 10br δ 11 10bf the distribution coefficient db is given by the experimental data of water interacting with igneous rock and sediment at 250 c 0 07 and 0 05 respectively reyes and trompetter 2012 the fractionation factor α between rock and fluid was assumed to be 0 985 at 250 c wunder et al 2005 the simulated results obtained with different fluid rock ratios r are shown in fig 10 in fig 10 the interactions of fluid precipitation and vapor first and second phase separation vapor with igneous and sediment are presented during these fluid rock interactions the boron concentrations and isotope compositions of fluid will approximate those of the rock yamaoka et al 2015 zhang et al 2015a b and the isotopic equilibration of rock would require fluid rock ratio r of 1 000 000 in a closed system and 100 000 in an open system muttik et al 2011 however as shown in fig 10 the δ11b values of all spring samples except sbdg do not fall on the fluid vapor rock interaction line this characteristic indicates that the phase separation process is more important than fluid rock interaction which is consistent with the results presented earlier in the discussion the sbdg shows the control of rock sediment which agrees with fig 6 although it is difficult to distinguish the fluid rock interaction and contamination processes of the xrq water sample in fig 6 here we can conclude that the effect of contamination may be more important in xrq additionally we found that if we use the mass balance equation proposed by giggenbach 1993 the cold spring and crater water values fall around the precipitation vapor rock interaction line whereas the lsd will fall slightly below the line believed to be controlled by metamorphic rock and the others will still plot outside the interaction line thus we believe that the effects of rock mainly control the chemical compositions of periphery springs while the water and wells in the crater area are controlled by phase separation processes and the input of magmatic volatiles 5 3 3 input of magmatic volatiles and magma genesis the δ11b values of magmatic volatiles are mainly controlled by rock re melting magmatic volatile evolution and differentiation processes zhang et al 2015b during the initial stage due to the high re melting temperature the δ11b value of volatiles is similar to the re melted rock leeman et al 2005 palmer et al 1992 however with the continued degassing of the residual melt the δ11b values of both the volatiles and residual melt decrease conversely if there is a clear increase in the δ11b values of the magmatic volatiles this may reflect the input of new magma in the deep magma pocket which may hint at a dormant volcano progressing into an active stage in addition if we know the δ11b values of the magmatic volatiles and the initial magma we can estimate the δ11b value of the residual melt using the rayleigh distillation equation then by comparing the different δ11b values of the initial and residual melts we can roughly assess the evolution state of the magma the rayleigh distillation equation taylor and sheppard 1986 can be expressed as follows 5 δ 11 b f δ 11 b i 10 3 b f b i α 1 10 3 6 δ 11 b m α δ 11 b f 10 3 10 3 where δ11bi and δ11bf are the initial and final magmatic δ11b values respectively δ11bm is the δ11b value of the magmatic volatiles and bi and bf are the initial and final b concentrations of the melt respectively previous studies have reported melting temperatures at the base of the changbaishan crystalline series due to the different evolutions of the magma pockets these melting temperatures vary widely from 500 c to 1340 c guo et al 2014 according to guo et al 2014 and wei et al 2013 there are two magma pockets a shallow pocket approximately 7 to 11 km below the surface with a low melting temperature that is replenished by a second deeper magma pocket approximately 55 to 65 km below the moho which originates from melting in the pacific crust and has been contaminated by archean crust qiu et al 2014 wei et al 2013 in addition the melting temperature can be decreased by the high b and f concentrations in the subducted rocks zhang et al 2015b a conservative value of 500 c has been suggested then the fractionation factor α can easily be obtained α 1 004 palmer et al 1992 according to the rayleigh distillation equation the residual melt has a b concentration of 79 92 ppm and a δ11b value of 10 07 comparing these two values with those of archean igneous rocks with b values ranging from 185 to 4000 ppm and δ11b values ranging from 12 4 to 13 5 jiang 2001 hu et al 2014 reveals that the newly generated magma underwent mixing with a component with low boron concentrations and high isotopic values e g marine sediment barth 1993 combined with the gas data analysis fig 7 these data indicate that these low boron concentrations and high isotopic values may come from the subducted pacific slab 5 4 geothermal water evolution 5 4 1 conceptual model since the cretaceous the collision of the pacific and eurasian plates has resulted in the formation of the cgs this process extends to the interior of the eurasian plate forming many magma intrusions ne trending graben basins and larger lithospheric faults which serve as favorable heat sources for water under the influence of gravity precipitation can easily infiltrate vertically along faults and permeable rocks during deep circulation the heat derived from the surrounding rocks is added to the fluid and mixed with hot vapor separated from the deep seawater in mesozoic and cenozoic strata thus forming the springs in the basin area with vapor continuing to separate from seawater in paleozoic strata the chlorine concentration increases in the residual water and the lateral migration of high cl fluid occurs under action of gravity then if a fracture or well exists the high cl water will be discharged i e in cr1 and cr2 the input of hot magmatic volatiles degassed from the shallow magma pocket leads to the second phase separation of the shallow reservoir around the crater area the vapor moves up along faults due to buoyancy it then mixes with precipitation in the crater to form the tc crater water and the lateral migration of residual water forms the springs in the crater area fig 11 5 4 2 the effects of the subduction of the pacific plate the evolution and behavior of vapor liquid hydrothermal systems were researched in depth by white et al 1971 and further developed by ingebritsen and sorey 1988 and the proposed models are generally accepted by researchers in this field the vapor liquid separation that occurs in a hydrothermal system is mainly related to later instantaneous dilation or the input of excess heat which initially occurs in a hot liquid dominant system that is close to the saturated vapor liquid boundary arnórsson et al 2007 then the vapor separated from the liquid rises due to buoyancy and the leaved high chlorine water laterally migrates to an exit which depends on the depth of the boiled fluid groundwater table the increased amount of vapor continues to thicken due to phase separation and its temperature is constrained throughout this process by the fluid pressure henley and hughes 2000 with the persistent input of heat and water recharge this process will continue until the system is full of vapor ingebritsen and sorey 1988 the cgs has existed for more than 50 years and it is difficult to analyze the initial occurrence of phase separation however due to the continued subduction of the pacific plate the magma pocket has become shallower over time ascending from 38 65 km in 1996 guo et al 1996 to 7 17 km in 2014 qiu et al 2014 according to the terrain deformation data changbaishan mountain is still being uplifted by 4 mm a zhang et al 2016 thus the heat input will increase over time this excess heat may lead to the further evolution of the vapor liquid system the above discussion indicates that the phase separation of the deep reservoir has entered its final stage but that in the shallow reservoir is still progressing the input of excess heat may cause the vapor thickness in the shallow reservoir to further increase which will cause the discharge of water in the springs in the crater area to decrease until it becomes a new fumarole this may also imply that another volcanic eruption is approaching the mean wellhead flow rate of the high cl water is less than 5 t h and well cr2 has been closed due to its low flow rate this indicates that there may be no water recharge to the deep reservoir if this conclusion is correct then these springs formed due to the convection of hot vapor separated from the first phase separation process which likely represents conductive heat this is because the deep reservoir is fully filled with vapor in the form of a thermostatic conduction layer and its temperature is controlled by magma intrusions or the depth of the moho with the continuous expulsion of vapor from the deep reservoir in extreme situations a magma origin hydrothermal system may be turned into a non hydrothermal system i e hot dry rock in other words the magma upwelling process may enrich and lead to the shallowing of the hot dry geothermal resources below the cgs 6 conclusion the combined use of boron concentration and isotope and gas data allows us to place better constraints on the formation process of the cgs this fluid has undergone multiple occurrences of phase separation based on its δ11b values and b cl ratios the first phase separation process occurred in the deep carbonate reservoir and approximately 75 87 5 of water became vapor the second phase separation process occurred around the igneous fracture reservoir in the crater area due to the input of hot magmatic volatiles the chemistry of the springs in the crater area is mainly controlled by the input of magmatic volatiles and the effects of fluid rock interaction were not obvious the springs from the basin area are controlled by the transformation of clay minerals and the xrq water sample shows contamination by sewage the springs from bedrock areas are mainly karst water heated by hot magmatic volatiles due to the continued subduction of the pacific plate new magma has formed with a δ11b value of approximately 10 07 which according to its gas characteristics reflects the addition of subducted components the addition of excess heat further encourages the phase separation process due to the lack of water recharging to the deep reservoir the gradually shallowing magma pocket may lead to the hydrothermal system becoming non hydrothermal

6753,the goal of this study is to analyze fluid geochemistry boron isotope and gas data to reassess the formation and evolution processes of the changbaishan volcanic geothermal system jilin china due to the presence of hot fumaroles with temperatures of higher than 100 c and sinters we believe that phase separation is occurring underground which is also indicated by the characteristics of the b and gas data based on their hydrochemical data and b cl ratios the thermal water samples in this area can be divided into three groups 1 group 1 is steam heated condensate water group 1 1 jj jlq group 1 2 sbdg xrq 2 group 2 is karst water cr3 and lsd and 3 group 3 is residual water cr1 and cr2 the preliminary discrimination of samples using b and gas data implies that group 1 1 around the crater is controlled by a second phase separation process which is induced by the input of hot magmatic material group 1 2 in the basin area is controlled by the transformation of clay minerals and the xrq water sample shows contamination by sewage group 2 represents karst water that has leached metamorphic rock and been directly heated by the input of hot magmatic volatiles and group 3 is the result of one seawater phase separation process the mixing and fluid rock interaction models based on the mass balance of boron concentration and isotope imply that the phase separation and input of magmatic volatiles are more important than fluid rock interactions in the formation of the changbaishan geothermal system and the first phase separation process in the deep carbonate reservoir occurred in a late stage with approximately 75 87 5 of water becoming vapor additionally the rayleigh distillation of b isotope implies that new magma is being generated below this area with the low b concentrations and high boron isotopic values of its gases implying that the mixed component may be derived from the subducted pacific plate e g marine sediment the addition of excess heat due to the continued subduction of the pacific plate has further encouraged the phase separation process and the subduction process has also accelerated the transition of the hydrothermal system into a non hydrothermal system keywords volcanic geothermal system thermal water boron isotopes phase separation magmatic volatiles fluid rock interaction 1 introduction the formation of natural geothermal activity in a volcanic area is generally affected by 1 phase separation 2 magmatic volatile input 3 fluid rock interaction and 4 later mixing processes arnórsson et al 2007 ingebritsen and sorey 1988 scot et al 2014 seyfried et al 1984 stefánsson et al 2017 white et al 1971 however these processes control the distribution and physical state of thermal water and lead to thermal waters with high concentrations of certain elements which may be beneficial or harmful to human health ellis and mahon 1964 freeze and cherry 1979 wang et al 2016 white 1957 zhao et al 2018a therefore research on the formation and evolution of geothermal systems is significant not only for understanding the origin boundary conditions and chemical processes operating along the flow within the aquifer but also for the exploration of thermal water and or the future utilization of geothermal resources arnórsson et al 2007 purnomo et al 2016 stefánsson et al 2017 white et al 1971 zhao et al 2018b the potential utility of boron is mainly based on the preference of each b isotope for a different coordination state i e tetrahedral coordination for 10b and trigonal coordination for 11b which is ph dependent and its phase separation characteristics at different t p x conditions bischoff and rosenbauer 1984 foustoukos and seyfried 2007 muttik et al 2011 palmer and swihart 1996 zeebe 2005 the boron isotopic signatures of continental waters span an extremely wide range from 27 to 75 pennisi et al 2006 xiao et al 2013 in hydrothermal fluids the δ11b values mainly vary from 10 5 to 54 9 aggarwal et al 2000 vengosh et al 1991 1994b the approximate ranges of δ11b values in different geochemical reservoirs are 9 7 to 6 8 for granites and fresh oceanic basalts 2 to 14 for altered oceanic basalts ishikawa and nakamura 1993 vengosh et al 1994a xiao et al 2013 1 5 to 6 5 for volcanic gases kanzaki et al 1979 12 to 58 for marine boron 32 to 26 for non marine boron 17 to 2 for igneous rocks and 34 to 22 for metamorphic rocks vengosh et al 1994a xiao et al 2013 yuan et al 2014 these geochemical characteristics make boron an excellent tracer for modeling geochemical cycles and determining different sources in fluid meditated and fluid dominated processes in geothermal systems boron isotopes are widely used to decipher the secondary clay mineral compositions and flow paths during fluid rock interactions with igneous rocks and sediments boschetti et al 2015 hervig et al 2002 keren and mezuman 1981 muttik et al 2011 wunder et al 2005 boron isotopes have also been successfully employed to describe the input of magmatic volatiles and mixing processes using the distinctive boron signatures of different water end members aggarwal et al 2000 arnórsson et al 2007 zhang et al 2015b due to its more volatile characteristics with the almost linear covariation of b cl with 1 cl observed in laboratory liquid vapor phase separation experiments the b cl ratio can be used to discern the phase separation processes in geothermal systems arnórsson and andrésdóttir 1995 bischoff and rosenbauer 1987 wu et al 2016 you et al 1994 moreover the high b cl ratios observed in discharging waters were attributed to the input of a b enriched component and used as a proxy for co2 cl to trace the addition of magmatic components giggenbach 1995 wu et al 2016 boron and its isotopic fractionation are associated with vapor liquid separation in thermal waters whereby 11b partitions selectively into the vapor phase leeman et al 1992 liebscher et al 2005 spivack et al 1990 empirical and experimental data indicate that in a closed system vapor liquid separation of b is weak whereas in an open system it will be partitioned into the vapor at temperatures of greater than 400 c purnomo et al 2016 liebscher et al 2005 truesdell et al 1989 thus the δ11bvapor liquid values are small ranging from 3 to 1 at 140 to 300 c leeman et al 1992 and at temperatures of greater than 300 c the δ11bvapor liquid values are negligible kanzaki et al 1979 nomura et al 1982 purnomo et al 2016 spivack et al 1990 leeman et al 1992 yuan et al 2014 zeebe 2005 the vapor liquid fractionation of boron depends on the system behavior open or closed which is conditioned by a t p x factor and boron isotope fractionation is not sensitive in high temperature systems thus phase separation processes can mainly be discriminated based on the b cl ratio and this process can be quantitatively described using the well established phase relations in the nacl h2o system bischoff and rosenbauer 1984 liebscher et al 2005 but little attention has been paid to the use of boron isotopes in this process leeman et al 2005 spivack et al 1990 zeebe 2005 the boron isotopes of near surface water mainly approach those of the rocks that they weather muttik et al 2011 rose koga et al 2006 while in deep water boron isotope values are temperature dependent and reach equilibrium with the host rock palmer et al 1987 leeman et al 2005 zhang et al 2015b if a continuous vapor liquid separation process exists isotope equilibrium will be broken and its value will decrease over time in an open system as 11b continues to partition into the vapor phase leeman et al 2005 palmer et al 1987 spivack et al 1990 therefore on this occasion the phase separation process can be quantitatively assessed using the δ11b value especially when the temperature is below 400 c in addition boron isotopes are not expected to fractionate significantly at magmatic temperatures 700 1250 c thus they can also record valuable information about deep fluid related processes muttik et al 2011 you et al 1994 1996 the changbaishan or mt baekdu volcanic geothermal system cgs is located in a convergent plate boundary back arc geothermal system that features many hydrothermal phenomena such as fumaroles and hot springs which are related to magmatic activity lin et al 1999 shangguan et al 1997 the fumaroles are distributed both in the crater and its periphery but high temperature fumaroles 115 c boiling point is 90 c at 2700 m in the changbaishan area 0 7 bar abs and spring pools 82 c are distributed around the crater and temperatures ranging from 21 c to 53 5 c are mainly found outside the crater the thermal water activity is always accompanied by intense gas release which mainly comes from the mantle based on its carbon and helium isotope data shangguan et al 1996 shangguan et al 1997 wei et al 2013 zhang et al 2015a the geothermal system is mainly recharged by precipitation with a high residence time higher than 62 years according to its t values lin et al 1999 yan 2016 and the deepest reservoir temperatures range from 237 c to 327 c shangguan et al 1996 however the δ18o and δd values of the thermal water are lower than those of the local precipitation changbaishan is the highest mountain in east china and its maximum elevation is 2744 m using the water balance approach chen and wang 2012 and jiang and chen 2015 discovered another water recharge source to this area which is the tibetan plateau the tibetan plateau is located in west china and changbaishan is located in east china there are many n e suture lines and the stress shows n w characteristics zhang et al 2016 thus we believe that there may be another factor controlling the hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics of the thermal water in the changbaishan area e g vapor liquid separation high temperature fumaroles are the dominant feature in the occurrence of vapor liquid separation ingebritsen and sorey 1988 white et al 1971 the discovery of high chlorine water in newly drilled wells at low elevations has led the cgs to be defined as a vapor dominant geothermal system which is categorized based on the major chemical composition and origin of surface geothermal fluids arnórsson et al 2007 fournier 1989 giggenbach 1988 kaasalainen and stefánsson 2012 valentio and stanzione 2003 nordstrom et al 2009 this new discovery provides us with an opportunity to further study the formation process of the cgs the present study was designed to use b concentration and isotopic composition data combined with gas and other chemical and isotopic data to reassess the formation and evolution processes of the cgs the vapor liquid separation and magmatic volatile input processes in this system are clearly implied by the b concentration and isotope and gas characteristics the results accentuate the need to reassess the existing models of the cgs which has broad implications for similar systems worldwide 2 geological setting the cgs is located on the northern margin of the north china platform and is the result of cenozoic volcanism in response to the subduction of the pacific plate beneath the eurasian plate and the continental rift system of the northeastern asian mainland liu et al 2010 zhao et al 2009 fig 1 its northern boundary is the jiapigou lithospheric fault its western boundary is the dunmi lithospheric fault and its southeastern boundary is korea the interior geologic structure is controlled by the ne sw trending yalujiang lithospheric fault which formed due to the collision of the longgang area with the helong area fig 1b changbaishan is a polygenetic volcanic edifice in the back arc region and its volcanism began at 5 ma researchers have identified five major eruption cycles in this area and the peak eruption of the latest eruption cycle occurred approximately 1000 years ago which is referred to as the millennium eruption liu et al 1997 liu et al 2015 shi et al 2005 xu et al 1993 eruptions were still occurring until 1903 xu et al 1993 the magma chamber has become shallower moving from depths of 38 65 km in 1996 guo et al 1996 to depths of 7 17 km in 2014 qiu et al 2014 similar to the crater area along the yalujiang lithospheric fault there are many obvious gravity anomalies in this area fig 1c these gravity anomalies may imply that there is another area of the rising sub mantle plume that the heat source is a major magmatic intrusion under the crater area and that the complex of minor intrusions at the periphery also contributes to the heat source the primary rocks around the crater area are gray comendite fallout and pyroclastic flow deposits 95 vol which are covered by dark trachyte pumice pyroclastic flow deposits 5 vol shi et al 2005 outside the crater area there are some exposures of precambrian granite and metamorphic rock mainly marble ordovician limestone and jurassic and cretaceous clastic rocks all of which are covered by extensive neogene basalts with thicknesses varying from 5 to 1500 m fig 1b d the geothermal reservoirs have been certified to comprise igneous fractures mesozoic sandstone rock and paleozoic carbonate rock based on deep drilling data yan et al 2016 although the magma pocket has become shallower over time no increase in spring water temperature has been detected this characteristic may imply that the vapor liquid phase separation taking place in the reservoir buffered the input of excess heat to the shallower magma pocket henley and hughes 2000 nuccio et al 1999 changbaishan is the highest mountain that also has rivers and lakes in northeast china the terrain is high in the southeast and low in the northwest and it comprises a northeast mountain chain and intermountain basin yan 2016

a continental monsoonal climate with four distinct seasons however winter lasts a long time and the average snow cover duration is greater than 170 days with an annual mean temperature ranging from 2 c to 6 c according to the geological environment monitoring station of jilin province 2004 the annual mean precipitation is 1332 6 mm and the average annual evaporation is 1180 mm furthermore a brief geothermal circulation model of a liquid dominated system has been established based on 2h 18o and t data yan 2016 3 materials and analytical methods the following samples were collected from the cgs

respect to the pdb standard this analysis was performed at the jilin university stable isotope research center a pre evacuation sampling method was used to collect gases from wells a funnel was submerged into a water channel and placed on top of bubbling sites to collect gases the air trapped in pipes was pumped completely out using a hand pump to prevent air contamination and at least 5 min was spent on the air pumping procedure when the funnel was filled with gases the pre evacuated aluminum foil bag piston was opened then the accumulated volcanic gases in the funnel were pumped into

0 table 1 the δ13cdic values of the hydrothermal waters in changbaishan form two different groups those with values ranging from 1 01 to 1 44 around the crater area and those with values ranging from 19 66 to 15 48 around the periphery area table 1 4 2 chemical and isotopic compositions of gas the gases from the cgs have high co2 84 3 98 6 and low n2 0 26 3 85 contents whereas the sample from the sbdg is dominated by n2 87 52 table 2 and none of the gases contain soluble components e g hcl hf co h2s or so2 single gas geothermometry shows a narrow variation in temperature but these temperatures are apparently higher than those calculated from solution geothermometry fig 3 and assembly gas geothermometry fig 3 table 3 this characteristic has been verified to be the result of phase separation arnórsson et al 2007 the reservoir temperatures fall within two ranges the crater temperatures range from 202 7 c to 238 3 c and the periphery temperatures range from 282 1 c to 290 0 c similar to the results calculated by shangguan et al 1996 even though the δ13cdic values of the cgs show wide variations table 1 except for that of the sbdg 12 30 the δ13cco2 values mainly fall within a narrow range 7 4 to 5 33 which are consistent with upper mantle values 6 5 2 5 pineau and javoy 1983 and those reported for arc related volcanic gases 9 8 to 1 3 marty et al 1989 varekamp et al 1992 zhang et al 2015a 5 discussion 5 1 preliminary discrimination of the controlling processes of the cgs 5 1 1 inferences from b cl decoupling generally chlorine is a conservative element below 160 c truesdell et al 1989 however the hcl concentration of a vapor in equilibrium with a solution increases as the solution temperature and chlorinity increase and the hcl concentration decreases as the solution ph increases at high temperatures ellis and mahon 1977 truesdell et al 1989 white and truesdell 1970 thus chlorine and boron data in geothermal systems have commonly been used to define the compositions of fluid within the aquifer as well as the origin physicochemical processes and mixing of fluids between reservoirs within a system aggarwal et al 2000 arnórsson and andrésdóttir 1995 similar to the division of hydrochemical characteristics three types of springs can also be clearly distinguished as shown in fig 4 1 those with cl b ratios slightly lower than those of average volcanic rock water group 1 2 those with water with low cl b ratios group 2 and 3 those with water with extremely high cl b ratios group 3 whose values are higher than that of seawater the formation of low cl b water is likely due to the input of a low cl b component such as early magmatic volatiles or phase separation arnórsson and andrésdóttir 1995 bernard et al 2011 valentio and stanzione 2003 unlike crater water sample hb group 2 samples show the obvious input of an hcl component fig 4 which may be due to the direct input of volcanic gas truesdell et al 1989 white and truesdell 1970 this difference can also be seen in fig 5 b the input of magmatic volatiles may lead to a lower na cl ratio due to the input of cl as hcl0 in contrast na and cl show similar behaviors during vapor liquid separation whereas b is more volatile aggarwal et al 2000 thus the lack of correlation between na cl and temperature in group 1 further indicates that these waters underwent a phase separation process while the group 2 samples reflect the result of the input of magmatic volatiles additionally the cl b ratios of group 1 1 are slightly lower than those of group 1 2 which exhibits an origin from different reservoirs fig 3 this may be related to a second phase separation process in group 1 1 which occurred due to the input of hot magmatic volatiles as the δ13cco2 and tdic values of these samples fall within the ranges of upper mantle values 6 5 2 5 pineau and javoy 1983 and volcanic gas values 9 8 to 1 3 marty et al 1989 varekamp et al 1992 zhang et al 2015a the fact that the cl b ratio of group 1 is slightly lower than the average volcanic rock value also implies that fluid rock interaction is not the main mechanism controlling the hydrochemical composition of this thermal water the extremely high cl b ratios of group 3 ranging from 12 714 to 13160 which are three orders of magnitude higher than those of the highest liquid dominated geothermal system cl b 50 bernard et al 2011 and even higher than that of seawater cl b 4318 oi et al 1996 may be related to the phase separation process of seawater as the highest volcanic gas condensates usually have cl b ratios ranging from 120 30 to 650 100 and evaporation processes cause little change in their relative amounts arnórsson and andrésdóttir 1995 bernard et al 2011 these two factors can be excluded 5 1 2 inference from boron isotopic data the δ11b values span a wide range from 12 19 to 35 86 in the cgs however three different groups of thermal water can also be seen with δ11b values ranging from 8 47 to 8 59 in group 1 13 31 to 6 11 in group 2 and 35 26 to 35 86 in group 3 table 1 due to the input of gas hb has a higher δ11b value and b concentration than tc table 2 fumarole gases from active volcanoes always have high b concentrations 94 542 ppm and high δ11b values 2 32 8 25 kanzaki et al 1979 leeman et al 2005 the δ11b values of gases are controlled by the parent source such as melting rocks fluid in which phase separation has occurred and the length of time over which these processes occur thus these δ11b values will span an even wider range than those obtained by kanzaki et al 1979 and leeman et al 2005 e g 12 5 tibetan hydrothermal system zhang et al 2015b if 7 08 is considered to be the minimum δ11b value of gas in the tc crater and the average vapor liquid separation temperature is 220 5 c according to the experiments performed by leeman et al 1992 and palmer et al 1992 a conservative vapor liquid fractionation factor can be suggested 1 2 then the δ11b value of the fluid can be calculated 8 28 this value falls within those observed in group 1 1 8 47 to 7 81 which implies that these springs have undergone a second vapor liquid separation due to the input of hot magmatic volatiles this conclusion can also be observed in the cl vs b diagram fig 4 where the cl b ratio of group 1 1 is lower than that of group 1 2 as the fractionation of b into the steam phase occurs more easily than that of cl in a neutral environment bernard et al 2011 the group 1 2 8 59 and 2 86 xrq and sbdg respectively water samples were collected from the basin area and their δ11b values indicate the control of clay minerals fig 6 the clay desorption effect involves no chloride release chao and you 2006 and during burial from the surface to the diagenesis metamorphism boundary the contribution of boron from clay minerals switches from a desorption interlayer source to a crystal source the range of boundary values is extreme as they range from 10 to 10 and are controlled by the evolution of smectite to illite boschetti et al 2015 the higher δ11b values of xrq compared with those of sbdg may be due to contamination fig 6 and or late stage diagenesis which controls the transformation from smectite to illite fig 6 the springs of group 2 are located in a bedrock area along the yalujiang lithospheric fault and have similar ion variation tendencies fig 2 their ion concentrations are extremely low compared with those of other spring samples and are characteristic of the direct input of magmatic volatiles fig 4 thus we believe that the formation of these springs may be due to the lateral migration of karst water heated by magmatic volatiles the input of magmatic volatiles is extremely obvious in well cr3 which records higher boron concentrations table 2 however the δ11b value 6 11 of cr3 is very similar to that of karst water 6 22 which implies that the δ11b values of magmatic volatiles may be approximately the same as the xrd value the extremely low δ11b value of lsd 13 31 may be a result of metamorphic rock leaching the lsd spring is exposed in metamorphic rock as the δ11b values of a rock decrease during progressive metamorphism romer and meixner 2014 xiao et al 2003 the main mechanisms that produce the heaviest δ11b values in thermal water are as follows 1 mixing with heavy δ11b water e g seawater or deep saline brine resulting from evaporation 2 late stage evaporation at the surface e g halite precipitation stage purnomo et al 2016 and 3 fluid rock interaction e g the fractionation of heavy δ11b rock at low temperatures during evaporation as 10b is adsorbed into minerals boschetti et al 2015 the water becomes enriched in 11b and a maximum enrichment of 30 has been reported by vengosh et al 1992 however this process requires continuous evaporation in the surface environment this has not been found in the changbaishan area and can thus be excluded which is consistent with the observed cl b characteristics large boron deposits are developed on the northern margin of the north china plate which are mainly distributed in volcanic rock and marble and exhibit wide variations in their δ11b isotope values ranging from 2 3 to 17 4 li 2009 xiao et al 2003 furthermore the formation mechanism of boron deposits is mainly attributed to deep brine which is the result of the vapor liquid separation of a seafloor hydrothermal system li 2009 xiao et al 2003 shangguan et al 1997 used the carbon isotope fractionation between co2 and ch4 and estimated the temperature of the deep reservoir to be approximately 327 c the fluid rock 11b fractionation at 350 c is 6 53 at 200 mpa and 8 41 at 50 mpa palmer et al 1992 which implies that the fluid rock equilibrium mechanism cannot explain the high δ11b values and low b concentrations observed at cr1 and cr2 additionally halite strata are undeveloped in the changbaishan area thus the heaviest δ11b value of high cl water may be related to a seawater intrusion or the presence of paleo seawater that has undergone phase separation 5 1 3 inferences from gases the gases from spring pools and wells in the cgs are representative of typical mantle origins fig 7 a li 2015 but these gases show the characteristics of re equilibration with a shallow reservoir rather than being derived directly from magma degassing because none of the gases contain soluble gas indicative of magma degassing e g hcl hf and h2s leeman et al 2005 purnomo et al 2016 scot et al 2014 the formation of the cgs is related to the subduction of the pacific plate thus zhang et al 2015a based on the c he isotopic coupling characteristics of gases assessed the proportions of the contributions of gas from three end members 25 from the upper mantle 11 from subducted sediments and 65 from slab carbonate and proposed that the co2 rich volcanic gases released by changbaishan volcano may have originated from the stagnant subducted pacific slab in the mantle transition zone fig 7b the δ13cco2 values may be altered by gas water interactions during ascent in the exsolution process in contrast to the tdic values of water the δ13cco2 values of gas will decrease with increasing fractionation e g δ13cdic co2 0 996 at 200 c capasso et al 1997 mook et al 1974 which implies that the δ13cco2 value of input gas may be even heavier the δ13cco2 values of cr1 and cr2 are similar to the those of gas in the crater area table 2 which fall within the ranges of upper mantle values 6 5 2 5 pineau and javoy 1983 and arc related volcanic gas values 9 8 to 1 3 marty et al 1989 varekamp et al 1992 zhang et al 2015a thus we speculate that they may have similar origin sources which is consistent with the co2 he ratio results table 2 in addition gas water interaction will only slightly alter the δ13cco2 value if there is a large co2 discharge capasso et al 1997 zhang et al 2015a this characteristic can also be seen in the δ11b values in which the springs of group 1 are the result of condensation of deep high δ11b vapor however the initial character has been covered by the large amount of magmatic volatile input additionally the tdic value of the sbdg is lower than those of wells which have been shown to contaminate mantle origin co2 by organic matter during exsolution li 2015 zhang et al 2015a this may be due to its low co2 content compared to those of the cr1 and cr2 areas as the tdic value will increase with continued co2 exsolution capasso et al 1997 the temperatures calculated by gas geothermometry range from 202 7 c to 290 0 c table 3 because h2 is strongly affected by changes in temperature redox conditions and pressure its concentration will decrease during its ascent to the surface janik and mclaren 2010 giggenbach 1987 thus the actual temperature of the vapor liquid separation will be higher generally geothermal vapor discharges from systems of 280 c generally do not contain co giggenbach 1992 but are found in gases from high temperature vapor dominated systems d amore 1992 this implies that the phase separation temperature in the cgs is not very high or that multiple phase separation events occurred which altered the up rising gas composition to result in the boron and isotopic characteristics described above additionally the influence of the input of vast deep gases on the b concentration and isotopic values can also be seen in the b vs hco3 and δ11b vs hco3 diagrams fig 8 this implies that the influence of gas input is stronger than that of fluid rock interaction in the cgs as the latter will create a native correlation between those members thus the input of co2 can cause a decrease in the ph values of the geothermal waters and the ph variation induced conversion of b oh 4 to b oh 3 will result in the preferential desorption of 10b rich b oh 4 from the solid phase thus reducing the δ11b values of the geothermal waters boschetti et al 2015 muttik et al 2011 5 2 constraints on the compositions of geochemical end members previous analyses of thermal water and gas data from the cgs revealed that the chemical compositions of water contribute to the following factors 1 near surface water precipitation 2 seawater 3 magmatic volatiles 4 igneous rocks and 5 sediment the final geochemistry of the exposed springs in the cgs is mainly controlled by four processes multiple phase separation boiling mixing fluid rock interactions and magmatic volatile input thus different end members must be constrained before their main controlling processes can be determined a summary of the estimated end members is provided in table 3 the δd and δ18o characteristics indicate that the cold spring water showed similar characteristics as local underground water which is recharged by precipitation rain and snow with δd values ranging from 106 6 to 98 4 and the geochemical composition is controlled by fluid rock interactions with volcanic rock lin et al 1999 yan et al 2015 2016 thus the boron concentrations and isotope compositions of the cold springs may represent near surface water with average values of 0 02 0 003 ppm and 6 2 0 16 respectively which is a main component in mixtures with up rising thermal water the boron isotope compositions of precipitation decrease from the sea to continental areas which can be described by the line δd 2 6 δ11b 133 rose koga et al 2006 and has been shown to be appropriate for china lü et al 2014 then the δ11b values of precipitation can be obtained ranging from 10 2 to 13 3 with an average value of 11 7 2 19 the boron concentration of precipitation indicates that it is a microcomponent with b concentrations mainly ranging from 0 1 to 3 0 ppb jiang 2000 rose koga et al 2006 that in china mainly falls around 1 4 ppb lü et al 2014 which is in accordance with this range because of the difficulty of directly sampling deep brine we hypothesize that the initial seawater was no different than the modern pacific ocean seawater which currently has δ11b values ranging from 38 7 to 40 4 barth 1993 in this study the value of seawater is close to the latter value b 4 4 ppm δ11b 40 oi et al 1996 all of the water samples exhibit the influence of magmatic volatiles figs 8 and 9 and this influence is especially obvious in hb lsd and cr3 figs 4 and 7 the vast input of magmatic volatiles will alter the boron concentration and isotope composition of the water however there is little change in the isotopic composition of cr3 even though there is a large increase in the boron concentration the highest boron value released from the rock is only 1 83 mg l wu et al 1984 compared with the recharge water xrd which implies that the boron in cr3 mainly originates from magma and there is very little contribution from the surrounding rock this value is also consistent with the result calculated considering a second phase separation process thus we regard 6 11 as the magmatic volatile value and its b concentrations range from 2 9 ppm to 10 0 ppm with an average value of 6 5 ppm jiang 2001 conducted systematic studies of the b isotopes in the igneous rocks in the changbaishan area and reported leucogranite δ11b values of 12 7 to 11 9 a mean value of 12 3 0 57 was used in this study to represent the initial δ11b value of the magma because of the negligible fractionation between tourmaline and melt occurring at magmatic temperatures kakihana et al 1977 palmer et al 1992 the b contents of the igneous rock range from 0 5 ppm to 758 8 ppm with an average value of 58 9 143 59 ppm 63 samples unpublished data the granite b concentration is approximately 45 74 ppm 14 samples unpublished data limited boron isotope data in sediment have been reported from the changbaishan area and we used the average modern sediment b 132 ppm δ11b 6 2 composition from wu et al 2016 5 3 modeling the controlling processes of the cgs 5 3 1 phase separation and mixing processes boron concentration and isotope and gas data indicate that multiple phase separations have occurred in the cgs and that the springs mainly represent the result of mixing between vapor residual water and near surface water that has been further altered by the input of magmatic volatiles if the end member compositions boron concentration and isotopic data of leaved liquid and separated vapor at different phase separation stages can be estimated then using a mixing model the phase separation stage of the cgs can be assessed the two solutions a b of the mixing model can be expressed by the following equations 1 b mix b a f b b 1 f 2 δ 11 b mix δ 11 b a b a b mix f δ 11 b b b b b mix 1 f where b and δ11b are the b concentrations and isotopic values of the components a b respectively subscripts a and b refer to solutions a and b respectively the subscript mix refers to the mixing water and f is the fraction of component a the δ11bvapor liquid values range from 3 to 1 at 140 to 300 c leeman et al 1992 and the distribution coefficients of δb cb liquid cb vapor range from 10 to 100 at 100 to 300 c leeman et al 1992 at temperatures of higher than 400 c the δ11bvapor liquid value will be negligible and the δb value will be lower than 2 3 liebscher et al 2005 based on the temperature calculated by the gas geothermometers we obtained a conservative value for the first with δ11bvapor liquid and δb values of 1 0 and 12 respectively and second separation with δ11bvapor liquid and δb values of 1 2 and 33 respectively stages in the cgs the hot thermal water up rising mixture mainly contained near surface water which was recharged by precipitation thus the average b concentration and isotope composition values in cold springs were used as the end member composition table 3 we hypothesize that the vapor expelled from the vapor dominant reservoir is a pulse process e g leeman et al 2005 then based on the mass balance of boron we modeled the separation and mixture processes occurring at different vapor liquid separation stages e g 50 75 87 5 table 4 fig 9 the characteristics of b concentration and isotope in the second phase of separation were mainly controlled by magmatic volatiles which increased the values of b concentration to approximately two orders of magnitude higher than those of the spring itself or even higher thus it is difficult to use the first phase process to assess this separation stage in shallow reservoirs as discussed above the hot spring in the crater area represents the residual water of second phase of separation so the average b concentration and isotope values were used to calculate the vapor composition and model the mixing process table 4 in a mixture of vapor leaved fluid and near surface water mixing trends are apparent on a plot of elemental boron vs δ11b values fig 9 the first phase separation process occurred in a later stage and approximately 75 87 5 of the water in the deep reservoir was evaporated this is consistent with the observed cl b values which increased in the vapor phase with fractionation bernard et al 2011 using the b concentration and isotope data the content of cl in the residual water can also be obtained with an average value of 10346 5 mg l thus the average vapor cl b ratio produced between the initial occurrences of phase separation until now can be calculated approximately 2277 a large cl b ratio implies that vapor liquid separation occurred close to the late stage or that deep seawater has an extremely low ph the distribution coefficient of b kd b between the vapor and liquid phases is roughly temperature dependent while the coefficient of hcl0 kd hcl is a complex function of temperature ph and cl bernard et al 2011 simonson and palmer 1993 tagirov et al 1997 however as the b concentration of the high cl water is extremely low the latter can be excluded group 1 1 is mainly located in the extended line of the mixture of residual water from the second phase separation with near surface water which further verifies the effect of the input of magmatic volatiles as they have similar δ11b values in addition the relatively high b concentrations indicate that these springs are not the products of deep water mixing with near surface water but are the result of multiple phase separation events accompanied by the input of magmatic volatiles which contradicts the suggestions of lin et al 1999 and yan 2016 the data points for group 1 2 do not fall on the mixing line which may be due to other factors that have altered their b concentrations and isotope characteristics such as fluid rock interaction and contamination in particular cr3 is the result of karst water heated by magmatic volatiles other than condensation water this sample is located on the extended line due to its δ11b value as the springs in the crater area are mainly controlled by magmatic volatiles 5 3 2 effects of fluid rock interaction in many low temperature geothermal fields around the world such as those in japan shigeno and abe 1983 and new zealand bernal et al 2014 their hydrochemical characteristics are usually related to fluid rock interactions this process will result in boron concentrations and fluid isotopes that approach the characteristics of their host rock within a narrow range yamaoka et al 2015 zhang et al 2015b in figs 4 and 5 the effects of magmatic volatiles can easily be distinguished in the cgs but it is difficult to define the difference between phase separation and steam heated condensate water fluid rock interactions to discriminate between these two factors we used a fluid rock interaction model assuming chemical equilibrium in a closed system and based on isotope mass balance wu et al 2016 yamaoka et al 2015 zhang et al 2015b a simple isotopic model can be established to estimate the effects of fluid rock interactions wu et al 2016 yamaoka et al 2015 this mass balance equation model can be expressed as follows 3 c f c r i rc j i d b r 4 11 10bf ci r 11 10br i rci f 11 10bf i ci r rci f db r αdb r where c is the b concentration the subscripts r and f refer to rock and fluid respectively the superscript i refers to the initial stage of the fluid rock interaction r is the fluid rock mass ratio db defined by db cr cf is the rock fluid bulk distribution coefficient of boron and the isotopic fractionation factor of boron α is defined by α δ 11 10br δ 11 10bf the distribution coefficient db is given by the experimental data of water interacting with igneous rock and sediment at 250 c 0 07 and 0 05 respectively reyes and trompetter 2012 the fractionation factor α between rock and fluid was assumed to be 0 985 at 250 c wunder et al 2005 the simulated results obtained with different fluid rock ratios r are shown in fig 10 in fig 10 the interactions of fluid precipitation and vapor first and second phase separation vapor with igneous and sediment are presented during these fluid rock interactions the boron concentrations and isotope compositions of fluid will approximate those of the rock yamaoka et al 2015 zhang et al 2015a b and the isotopic equilibration of rock would require fluid rock ratio r of 1 000 000 in a closed system and 100 000 in an open system muttik et al 2011 however as shown in fig 10 the δ11b values of all spring samples except sbdg do not fall on the fluid vapor rock interaction line this characteristic indicates that the phase separation process is more important than fluid rock interaction which is consistent with the results presented earlier in the discussion the sbdg shows the control of rock sediment which agrees with fig 6 although it is difficult to distinguish the fluid rock interaction and contamination processes of the xrq water sample in fig 6 here we can conclude that the effect of contamination may be more important in xrq additionally we found that if we use the mass balance equation proposed by giggenbach 1993 the cold spring and crater water values fall around the precipitation vapor rock interaction line whereas the lsd will fall slightly below the line believed to be controlled by metamorphic rock and the others will still plot outside the interaction line thus we believe that the effects of rock mainly control the chemical compositions of periphery springs while the water and wells in the crater area are controlled by phase separation processes and the input of magmatic volatiles 5 3 3 input of magmatic volatiles and magma genesis the δ11b values of magmatic volatiles are mainly controlled by rock re melting magmatic volatile evolution and differentiation processes zhang et al 2015b during the initial stage due to the high re melting temperature the δ11b value of volatiles is similar to the re melted rock leeman et al 2005 palmer et al 1992 however with the continued degassing of the residual melt the δ11b values of both the volatiles and residual melt decrease conversely if there is a clear increase in the δ11b values of the magmatic volatiles this may reflect the input of new magma in the deep magma pocket which may hint at a dormant volcano progressing into an active stage in addition if we know the δ11b values of the magmatic volatiles and the initial magma we can estimate the δ11b value of the residual melt using the rayleigh distillation equation then by comparing the different δ11b values of the initial and residual melts we can roughly assess the evolution state of the magma the rayleigh distillation equation taylor and sheppard 1986 can be expressed as follows 5 δ 11 b f δ 11 b i 10 3 b f b i α 1 10 3 6 δ 11 b m α δ 11 b f 10 3 10 3 where δ11bi and δ11bf are the initial and final magmatic δ11b values respectively δ11bm is the δ11b value of the magmatic volatiles and bi and bf are the initial and final b concentrations of the melt respectively previous studies have reported melting temperatures at the base of the changbaishan crystalline series due to the different evolutions of the magma pockets these melting temperatures vary widely from 500 c to 1340 c guo et al 2014 according to guo et al 2014 and wei et al 2013 there are two magma pockets a shallow pocket approximately 7 to 11 km below the surface with a low melting temperature that is replenished by a second deeper magma pocket approximately 55 to 65 km below the moho which originates from melting in the pacific crust and has been contaminated by archean crust qiu et al 2014 wei et al 2013 in addition the melting temperature can be decreased by the high b and f concentrations in the subducted rocks zhang et al 2015b a conservative value of 500 c has been suggested then the fractionation factor α can easily be obtained α 1 004 palmer et al 1992 according to the rayleigh distillation equation the residual melt has a b concentration of 79 92 ppm and a δ11b value of 10 07 comparing these two values with those of archean igneous rocks with b values ranging from 185 to 4000 ppm and δ11b values ranging from 12 4 to 13 5 jiang 2001 hu et al 2014 reveals that the newly generated magma underwent mixing with a component with low boron concentrations and high isotopic values e g marine sediment barth 1993 combined with the gas data analysis fig 7 these data indicate that these low boron concentrations and high isotopic values may come from the subducted pacific slab 5 4 geothermal water evolution 5 4 1 conceptual model since the cretaceous the collision of the pacific and eurasian plates has resulted in the formation of the cgs this process extends to the interior of the eurasian plate forming many magma intrusions ne trending graben basins and larger lithospheric faults which serve as favorable heat sources for water under the influence of gravity precipitation can easily infiltrate vertically along faults and permeable rocks during deep circulation the heat derived from the surrounding rocks is added to the fluid and mixed with hot vapor separated from the deep seawater in mesozoic and cenozoic strata thus forming the springs in the basin area with vapor continuing to separate from seawater in paleozoic strata the chlorine concentration increases in the residual water and the lateral migration of high cl fluid occurs under action of gravity then if a fracture or well exists the high cl water will be discharged i e in cr1 and cr2 the input of hot magmatic volatiles degassed from the shallow magma pocket leads to the second phase separation of the shallow reservoir around the crater area the vapor moves up along faults due to buoyancy it then mixes with precipitation in the crater to form the tc crater water and the lateral migration of residual water forms the springs in the crater area fig 11 5 4 2 the effects of the subduction of the pacific plate the evolution and behavior of vapor liquid hydrothermal systems were researched in depth by white et al 1971 and further developed by ingebritsen and sorey 1988 and the proposed models are generally accepted by researchers in this field the vapor liquid separation that occurs in a hydrothermal system is mainly related to later instantaneous dilation or the input of excess heat which initially occurs in a hot liquid dominant system that is close to the saturated vapor liquid boundary arnórsson et al 2007 then the vapor separated from the liquid rises due to buoyancy and the leaved high chlorine water laterally migrates to an exit which depends on the depth of the boiled fluid groundwater table the increased amount of vapor continues to thicken due to phase separation and its temperature is constrained throughout this process by the fluid pressure henley and hughes 2000 with the persistent input of heat and water recharge this process will continue until the system is full of vapor ingebritsen and sorey 1988 the cgs has existed for more than 50 years and it is difficult to analyze the initial occurrence of phase separation however due to the continued subduction of the pacific plate the magma pocket has become shallower over time ascending from 38 65 km in 1996 guo et al 1996 to 7 17 km in 2014 qiu et al 2014 according to the terrain deformation data changbaishan mountain is still being uplifted by 4 mm a zhang et al 2016 thus the heat input will increase over time this excess heat may lead to the further evolution of the vapor liquid system the above discussion indicates that the phase separation of the deep reservoir has entered its final stage but that in the shallow reservoir is still progressing the input of excess heat may cause the vapor thickness in the shallow reservoir to further increase which will cause the discharge of water in the springs in the crater area to decrease until it becomes a new fumarole this may also imply that another volcanic eruption is approaching the mean wellhead flow rate of the high cl water is less than 5 t h and well cr2 has been closed due to its low flow rate this indicates that there may be no water recharge to the deep reservoir if this conclusion is correct then these springs formed due to the convection of hot vapor separated from the first phase separation process which likely represents conductive heat this is because the deep reservoir is fully filled with vapor in the form of a thermostatic conduction layer and its temperature is controlled by magma intrusions or the depth of the moho with the continuous expulsion of vapor from the deep reservoir in extreme situations a magma origin hydrothermal system may be turned into a non hydrothermal system i e hot dry rock in other words the magma upwelling process may enrich and lead to the shallowing of the hot dry geothermal resources below the cgs 6 conclusion the combined use of boron concentration and isotope and gas data allows us to place better constraints on the formation process of the cgs this fluid has undergone multiple occurrences of phase separation based on its δ11b values and b cl ratios the first phase separation process occurred in the deep carbonate reservoir and approximately 75 87 5 of water became vapor the second phase separation process occurred around the igneous fracture reservoir in the crater area due to the input of hot magmatic volatiles the chemistry of the springs in the crater area is mainly controlled by the input of magmatic volatiles and the effects of fluid rock interaction were not obvious the springs from the basin area are controlled by the transformation of clay minerals and the xrq water sample shows contamination by sewage the springs from bedrock areas are mainly karst water heated by hot magmatic volatiles due to the continued subduction of the pacific plate new magma has formed with a δ11b value of approximately 10 07 which according to its gas characteristics reflects the addition of subducted components the addition of excess heat further encourages the phase separation process due to the lack of water recharging to the deep reservoir the gradually shallowing magma pocket may lead to the hydrothermal system becoming non hydrothermal

6754,lake urmia a shallow endemic hypersaline lake in northwest iran has undergone a dramatic decline in its water level wl by about 8 m since 1995 the primary cause of the wl decline in lake urmia has been debated in the scientific literature regarding whether it has been predominantly driven by atmospheric climate change or by human activities in the watershed landscape using available climate hydrological and vegetation data for the period 1981 2015 this study analyzes and aims to explain the lake desiccation based on other observed hydro climatic and vegetation changes in the lake urmia watershed and classical exploratory statistical methods the analysis accounts for the relationships between atmospheric climate change precipitation p temperature t and hydrological soil moisture sm and wl and vegetation cover vc including agricultural crops and other vegetation changes in the landscape results show that p t and sm changes cannot explain the sharp decline in lake wl since 2000 instead the agricultural increase of vc in the watershed correlates well with the lake wl change indicating this human driven vc and associated irrigation expansion as the dominant human driver of the lake urmia desiccation specifically the greater transpiration from the expanded and increasingly irrigated agricultural crops implies increased total evapotranspiration and associated consumptive use of water inherently related to the irrigation and water diversion and storage developments in the watershed thereby the runoff from the watershed into the lake has decreased and the remaining smaller inflow to the lake has been insufficient for keeping up the previous lake wl causing the observed wl drop to current conditions keywords lake urmia climate change land use change anthropogenic change

pokhrel et al 2017 and subsurface felfelani et al 2017 hashemi et al 2015 mohan et al 2018 such as rivers streams lakes and groundwater may also be due to human driven land and water use developments

deterioration the fate of lake urmia has become an active but controversial research topic in recent years various aspects of the lake including the dominant causes of its desiccation have been studied from different standpoints leading to a contested debate between two main camps while some researchers consider the lake urmia retreat to be predominantly the outcome of the changing climate and a climate driven increase of droughts delju et al 2013 fathian et al 2015 others argue that similarly to other parts of the world destouni et al 2013 jaramillo and destouni 2015 2014 the lake may be suffering from aral sea syndrome aghakouchak et al 2015b implying that its current situation is not primarily due to purely atmospheric climate change although seasonal changes in the lake water level are strongly influenced by large scale atmospheric circulation patterns jalili et al 2012 different studies have attributed the decline in lake water content to extensive human activities in the watershed itself such as various dam building projects especially since the 1990s alborzi et al 2018 ashraf et al 2017 hassanzadeh et al 2012 khatami 2013 p 82 khoshtinat et al 2015 khosravi et al

cases due to aral sea syndrome occurrence seen in various parts of the world thus this study develops a change attribution approach section 3 4 change attribution approach to evaluating the significance of different climatic and anthropogenic landscape change drivers over the lake urmia watershed for the change impacts observed in the watershed vegetation including agricultural crops and other vegetation and in lake urmia itself section 4 results and discussions the vegetation development is thus investigated as a possible important impact indicator of the hydro climatic interplay between the atmospheric climate change and the hydrological and various agriculture related human developments occurring over the watershed landscape the study involves a statistical analysis of climate hydrological and vegetation characteristics for the period 1981 2015 for this period we compile the available data and compare the variations and long term patterns of the atmospheric climate variables of land surface air temperature t and precipitation p the hydrological variables of soil moisture sm and lake water level wl and a vegetation coverage vc variable for the landscape of the lake urmia watershed for these main hydro climatic vegetation variables t p sm wl and vc an integrated correlation and trend analysis is conducted using monthly and seasonal data for 2000 2015 the developed approach in this study can be applied for better investigation of similar cases around the world 2 study area and data 2 1 study area lake urmia is a transboundary water system the lake itself is located between east azerbaijan and west azerbaijan provinces in northwest iran fig 1 with inflowing rivers originating in these two provinces and the kurdistan province to the south the lake watershed area is 51 867 km2 and contains 14 main inflowing rivers khatami 2013 lake urmia is a shallow terminal lake with depth varying from 5 to 16 m length in the s n direction of approximately 140 km and central point coordinates of 37 42 n 45 19 e the lake is located in a semi arid climate with mean annual p of about 357 mm fazel et al 2017 khalyani et al 2014 vaheddoost and aksoy 2017 and the mean annual t of about 11 c delju et al 2013 daily minimum t in the region ranges between 0 c and 23 c in winter and the daily maximum t can reach 39 c during summers based on measurements made at hydrometric stations located at the outlet of major reservoirs in the watershed the average water discharge into the lake decreased from 2112 to 750 mcm million cubic meters i e around 65 reduction between 1960 and 2010 khoshtinat et al 2015 the wl of the lake has also dropped significantly in recent decades from 1278 m above sea level m a s l in 1995 to 1270 m a s l water depth reduction of 8 m in 2014 khatami and berndtsson 2012 tourian et al 2015 zoljoodi and didevarasl 2014 2 2 climate data climatic conditions in the lake urmia watershed are assessed in terms of the main climate variables p and t which generally have significant implications for the hydrologic cycle and vegetation dynamics 2 2 1 precipitation three datasets are used here to analyze monthly p fig 2 these are the climate prediction center cpc merged analysis of precipitation cmap the global precipitation climatology project version 2 3 gpcp and the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr cmap is a product of the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa and provides average monthly data from 1979 to present with a spatial resolution of 2 5 2 5 noaa 2016a cmap data are derived from microwave and infrared observations from polar orbiting and geostationary satellites as well as gauge data analysis gpcp adler et al 2003 provides data with the same spatial and temporal resolution as cmap but uses geostationary infrared satellite imagery retrievals and different algorithms to estimate p persiann cdr daily mean p data is available from 1983 at a 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution this dataset primarily relies on satellite infrared observations and is corrected based on passive microwave information and ground based observations ashouri et al 2015 overall the three p data sets are consistent with respect to their mean daily p information persiann cdr and gpcp indicate that the average p in the lake urmia watershed is 1 4 mm day whereas cmap shows that the average p is 1 3 mm day to select the best p estimate for our study domain the triple collocation tc error characterization method stoffelen 1998 is applied to the three p estimates tc provides an estimate of the random error in three collocated estimates measurements of the same variable without assuming any of the three to be error free tc uses the covariance matrix of the three measurements and by assuming that the three measurements have independent random errors and uncorrelated random errors with the truth it calculates the variance of the random error in each measurement in addition tc also provides the correlation coefficient cc between each measurement and the truth detailed derivation of this technique is explained in mccoll et al 2014 tc has been applied to a wide range of environmental variables including sm p sea surface salinity and land water storage alemohammad et al 2015 draper et al 2013 parinussa et al 2011 ratheesh et al 2013 roebeling et al 2012 the three estimates of p are aggregated to a spatial resolution of 2 5 2 5 and then tc is applied to the aggregated monthly estimates of p between 1983 and 2016 during which all three datasets are available tian et al 2013 assumed the error structure of monthly p data to be additive based on which the classical extended triple collocation with additive error model mccoll et al 2014 is used here the analysis shows that gpcp has the smallest random error among the three and the highest correlation with the truth based on tc estimates the standard deviation of random error in gpcp persiann cdr and cmap is estimated to be 0 04 0 17 and 0 50 mm day respectively and their respective ccs are 0 99 0 97 and 0 63 moreover gpcp showed the highest correlation with the mean p estimates derived from the three measurements therefore gpcp is selected as the best data source for the analysis 2 2 2 temperature t data are extracted from another product of noaa noaa 2016b representing a combination of the global historical climatology network ghcn and the climate anomaly monitoring system cams datasets t ghcn cams this high resolution dataset provides global monthly t data from 1948 with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 it provides t estimates for land areas and is adjusted by comparison with observational data fan and van den dool 2008 based on monthly data the average t in the lake watershed is 9 99 c for the period 1948 2016 while the average t is 10 17 c for the period 2000 2016 the monthly average t time series is presented in fig 3 2 3 soil moisture data surface sm estimates are based on the european space agency esa climate change initiative cci program s soil moisture esa cci sm product this product blends sm observations from a suite of active and passive instruments and provides a data record of sm estimates for the period 1978 2015 liu et al 2012 2011 wagner et al 2012 here the daily data from the latest version version 3 2 of this product are used observations are aggregated to monthly values for analysis the spatial resolution of the data is 0 25 0 25 see fig 4 2 4 vegetation cover data during recent decades remote sensing imagery has provided a wide range of tools for monitoring the health and condition of vc especially for large scale studies in this regard several indices have been defined based on raw remotely sensed reflectance data for study of earth surface characteristics among which the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is a useful and well studied variable for vegetation study schultz et al 2016 tillack et al 2014 viña et al 2011 ndvi was first used by rouse et al 1974 and is calculated based on the response of vegetation to electromagnetic waves in red red and near infrared nir bands 1 ndvi n i r r e d n i r r e d ndvi is a dimensionless parameter and its value ranges between 1 and 1 generally values greater than 0 4 represent temperate and tropical rainforests while ndvi values between 0 2 and 0 4 indicate grassland negative low values near 1 normally refer to water and small values close to zero between 0 1 and 0 1 represent urban areas or areas covered by rock soil etc weier and herring 2000 as suggested by many studies e g delbart et al 2005 khazaei and wu 2018 nemani and running 1997 an ndvi value of 0 4 can be used as a threshold for distinguishing vegetation from other types of land cover this can be used to classify land into vegetated and non vegetated land cover types and thereby as basis for estimating vc in this study ndvi data are obtained from two us nasa datasets mod13q1 product of moderate resolution imaging spectrometer modis and normalized difference vegetation index 3rd generation using the global inventory monitoring and modeling system gimms modis13q1 is estimated from observations onboard the terra satellite didan 2015 nasa 2014a since february 2000 mod13q1 provides vegetation index values namely ndvi and enhanced vegetation index evi as well as blue blue red nir and mid infrared mir bands on an 8 day basis at a spatial resolution of 250 m evi is another commonly used vegetation index that estimates vegetation based on red nir and blue bands with improved sensitivity in highly vegetated areas huete et al 2002 ndvi and evi products provided by modis are computed from atmospherically corrected surface reflectance imagery data in which water clouds heavy aerosols and cloud shadows have been masked out despite its high resolution and abundant temporal availability modis ndvi data is not available prior to the year 2000 ndvi3g the latest version of gimms product nasa 2014b provides global estimates of ndvi in a daily format with a spatial resolution of 1 12 1 12 8 km between july 1981 and 2015 pinzon and tucker 2014 tucker et al 2005 ndvi3g is used for hydro climatic analyses including trend and correlation analysis during the 1981 2015 period see fig 5 as modis ndvi provides vc estimates with a higher resolution of 250 m modis ndvi is additionally used to evaluate the ndvi3g results on expansion reduction of vc in the lake urmia watershed after february 2000 the evaluation showed that vc estimates of modis ndvi and ndvi3g in the lake urmia watershed are strongly correlated cc 0 92 p value 0 00 during the 2000 2015 period any potential trend in net radiation could affect the ndvi estimates kustas et al 1993 hence the possible impact of net radiation on the vc estimates is examined over the lake urmia watershed nasa gewex srb product provides net radiation data globally between 1983 and 2007 nasa 2012 and ceres provides net radiation estimates worldwide since 2000 nasa 2017 srb and ceres data were merged to generate net radiation record for the period of 1985 2015 orth and seneviratne 2015 and no trend was detected in net radiation time series in this period 2 5 water level data two datasets are used for lake wl direct gauge observations and the global reservoirs lakes g realm dataset daily observations have been recorded at the golmankhane station 37 36 n 45 16 e since 1966 khatami 2013 p 17 and these data were obtained from the urmia lake restoration program ulrp g realm also provides wl estimates on a 10 day basis since 1992 g realm data are computed from topex poseidon t p5 jason 1 and jason 2 ostm altimetry usda 2017 fig 6 shows the wl variations of lake urmia for the period 1966 2016 although observed and remotely sensed wl fluctuations differ as shown in fig 6 their trends agree with each other in this study gauge observations are selected to analyze wl since they are on a daily basis and cover a longer period additionally using g realm to estimate wl could introduce errors uncertainties associated with the processing of the satellite data however there are also some measurement errors when observed data are used as wl estimates khazaei and hosseini 2015 3 methods 3 1 point of change detection a breakpoint towards a rapid decline around the mid 1990s is seen in the wl time series fig 6 the pettitt test pettitt 1979 is used to find the onset of the wl decline trend and split the wl time series into two shorter periods before and after the onset for the further hydro climatic analyses the pettit test is widely used for detecting points of abrupt changes or sharp variations in time series of physical variables fan et al 2012 rougé et al 2013 villarini et al 2009 yao et al 2015 for a given time series of continuous data x i i 1 2 3 n the test statistic ut n is calculated as 2 u t n u t 1 n v t n t 2 3 n where n is the sample size and 3 v t n i 1 n s g n x t x i a n d s g n x t x i 1 x t x i 0 x t x i 1 x t x i the location of the breakpoint kn in the time series is defined as 4 k n m a x u t n t 1 2 n the statistical significance of kn can be approximated by 5 p 2 e x p 6 k n 2 n 3 n 2 for low p values the null hypothesis h0 no change point exists can be rejected and there is a significant breakpoint that divides the time series into pre and post change parts 3 2 trend analysis 3 2 1 mann kendall test the mann kendall test kendall et al 1990 mann 1945 is a nonparametric method for evaluating the presence of a trend or non stationarity of the mean in a time series and has been widely used to analyze trends in hydrological variables ahn and merwade 2014 burn and hag elnur 2002 the test statistics smk can be defined as 6 s mk i 1 n j i 1 n s g n x j x i where for a time series x i i 1 2 3 n the time index i e g the year month etc of observation of each datum is monotonically increasing by definition which simplifies the calculations wilks 2011 p 166 each and every data point is sequentially treated as a reference point and is compared to all of the following data points douglas et al 2000 the function sgn xj xi is defined in eq 3 for n 8 smk follows an approximately normal distribution and its variance is calculated as 7 σ s mk 2 n n 1 2 n 5 18 the mann kendall test statistic zmk is calculated by 8 z mk s mk 1 σ s mk s mk 0 0 s mk 0 s mk 1 σ s mk s mk 0 the null hypothesis h0 no trend detected is rejected at 5 significance level p value 0 05 when zmk 1 96 then a positive value of zmk indicates a positive trend and a negative zmk value indicates a negative trend 3 2 2 seasonal kendall trend the mann kendall test does not account for seasonality and therefore the kendall seasonal trend method is also used hirsch and slack 1984 the test statistics are calculated using equations 9 to 11 9 s i 1 n k 1 j i 1 n k s g n x kj x ki a n d s sk k 1 n s where j i nk is the count of measurements in season k 10 σ s sk 2 k 1 n n k n k 1 2 n k 5 18 11 z sk s sk 1 σ s sk s sk 0 0 s sk 0 s sk 1 σ s sk s sk 0 as for the mann kendall test a positive value of zsk means that the trend is increasing a negative value signifies a decreasing trend and zero means no trend the trend is also significant at p value 0 05 when zsk 1 96 in the presence of seasonality in the data the value of zsk tends to be higher than zmk 3 3 correlation analysis the association inter dependency between different hydro climatic and vegetation variables is examined using pearson spearman and kendall ccs bevan 2013 kendall and maurice 1970 spearman and kendall ccs are robust not dependent upon the underlying distribution of the data and resistant not sensitive to extreme values alternatives to pearson cc wilks 2011 p 55 the values of all the above ccs range between 1 and 1 a negative correlation implies an inverse relationship between variables ratner 2009 3 4 change attribution approach an approach is developed for explaining i e attributing main drivers causes of the observed water changes within the classical paradigm of statistical analysis i e frequentist inference using an inverse approach changes in the records using trend analysis are first identified based on which hypotheses are formed to explain the changes the hypotheses are then evaluated based on observed associations between hydro climatic variables using correlation analysis to explain the changes through this approach the explanatory power of the commonplace exploratory statistical methods is used for change attribution using the available data for the studied hydro climatic and vegetation variables thus constituting a change attribution analysis while the spatial variability of each hydro climatic variable is aggregated into a single representative time series for the whole watershed the temporal variability is accounted for by performing the analysis across different time scales namely long term defined as the entire record and short term defined within each pre and post change period overall defined over the entire short or long term record and seasonal defined as wet and dry months in this study for representing intra annual periods with particular characteristics 4 results and discussions generating vc data is one of the outcomes of this study needed for the change attribution analysis first the vegetation dynamics results are presented section 4 1 followed by the discussion of the change attribution analysis results trends and correlations sections 4 2 and 4 3 the section concludes with a discussion of the role of land water use changes i e expansion of irrigation and agricultural growth in the lake s desiccation the statistically significant results are discussed although all results including the non significant ones are presented it should be noted that the statistical significance i e p value of a given statistic does not necessarily imply its importance or size effect that is in interpreting the results the p value is not a measure of how well or how much of the variation in a given variable is associated with the variation in another one wasserstein and lazar 2016 4 1 vegetation dynamics fig 7 shows the monthly average of each hydro climatic variable based on the common base period for all variables vc varies considerably in the watershed from spring april june to winter january march the best time of the year for plant growth in the region is late spring and early summer may july when t is moderate and p is maximum see fig 7 in winter rainfall amount is sufficient for plant photosynthesis but is mostly in the form of snow and t is too low that plant photosynthesis is limited june september are the hottest months of the year with the least rainfall vc decreases significantly from may onwards fig 8 further shows the spatial and temporal variations in vc expressed as ndvi within the lake urmia watershed in april july during 2000 2016 examination of the spatio temporal dynamics of vc fig 8 and green bars in fig 7 suggests that vegetation peaks in may based on available observations average t is estimated to be 13 c during this month while p is 1 7 mm day both at proper levels for plant growth thus may is selected as the wet month spell representative july beige bars in fig 7 is also selected as the dry month representative based on its low average p 0 5 mm day maximal average t 23 c i e the hottest month of the year and an expected low average vc it should be noted that august is also seemingly another candidate for the dry period representative but the magnitude and variability of vc is very low during august limiting the analysis of vc change spring particularly may is an important period for analyzing vc since vc variations mostly expansion has occurred at a faster rate during this time vegetation dynamics expressed as ndvi are known to be strongly correlated with soil water index and moisture profile zribi et al 2010 and with p gessner et al 2013 both ndvi and evi are used here to examine vc given their similar results only those based on ndvi are presented 4 2 trends analysis trends magnitude and statistical significance in the hydro climatic variables are analyzed across two different sets of time scales namely 1 short and long term periods and 2 seasonal and overall periods first long term trends in monthly records of the hydro climatic variables are calculated during 1981 2015 fig 9 and table 1 long term trends may be indicative of climate driven variations and can provide an overview of the hydro climatic characteristics of the watershed second short term trends for the two sub periods of pre change 1981 1999 and post change 2000 2015 are calculated these sub periods are defined based on the change point in the wl records detected as the year 2000 using the pettitt test it should be noted that the change point detection method as a non parametric analysis is dependent upon the sample size that is selecting the year 2000 as the cut off for pre and post change periods solely based on a statistical analysis is not sufficient this selection is further justified based on physical characteristics of the watershed and it is consistent with multiple studies that identified the mid to late 1990s as the period of major changes in the lake s watershed for instance chaudhari et al 2018 demonstrated that the impacts of human activities e g dam constructions and the expansion of urban and agricultural lands on the streamflow q inflowing to the lake were amplified beginning 1999 with the lowest annual average p within the period of 1979 2016 coinciding with a severe drought started in 1998 leading to a significant decrease in q into the lake alborzi et al 2018 have also demonstrated a significant decrease in q into the lake during the early 2000s due to the drought period of 1998 2002 and increased withdrawal of surface water resources to meet the potable and agricultural water demands during this period due to the fact that the existing autocorrelation in monthly records could bias trend results seasonal kendall trends are also calculated to evaluate the overall trends 4 2 1 is there a potential link between the changes in wl t and p no overall long term and short term both pre and post change trends are found for climatic variables p and t while the strong seasonal and overall trends of wl for the pre change period are increasing it exhibits a strong decreasing trend both seasonally and overall during the post change period due to the strength of the post change wl trends the long term trends seasonal and overall are also decreasing with a greater order of magnitude i e zmk and zsk for wl than the other hydro climatic variables no trend is detected in p records across the time scales although increasing seasonal trends are apparent in the long term and pre change short term t records no trend is detected in the post change period with severe declining trends in wl these observations on p and t trends contradict the proposition that lake urmia has been subjected to lower p and higher t during the past two decades that said the possible association between wl fluctuations and variability in p and t is further investigated in the next section 4 3 correlation analysis 4 2 2 is there a link between the changes in wl and vc although there is a positive seasonal trend in vc during both pre and post change periods the post change trend is stronger a greater order of magnitude in terms of the trend test statistic zsk due to the expansion of irrigation and agricultural activities discussed in section 4 4 given the high correlation found in other studies between vegetation increase and increase in total evapotranspiration et as well as the transpiration component in et orth and destouni 2018 the positive and steeper trend in the post change vc compared to its pre change trend implies increased transpiration and associated total et in this period over which the overall p t and sm levels remain essentially stable the observed increase in vc is also consistent with reports on expansion of agricultural lands and increased water withdrawal in the region ashraf et al 2017 chaudhari et al 2018 as a consequence of fundamental water balance in the watershed in analogy with similar previous findings e g for the aral sea desiccation destouni et al 2010 increased et due to intensive or inefficient irrigation under stable p and sm conditions means that runoff in the watershed and the associated discharge q into the lake must have decreased in this period leading to the observed wl decline by 8 m 50 of the maximum depth of the lake between 1995 and 2016 4 2 3 trends in wet and dry spells the hydro climatic changes in the wet and dry months may and july were also examined for potential dominant seasonal variations see fig 10 as shown in fig 10 the overall trends in may wet month and july dry month records are similar to the short and long term trends in the mean monthly time series while p t and sm either exhibit statistically non significant or almost near horizontal trends wl has seasonal decreasing trends although the vc records for the dry month are not statistically significant there is a dramatic increase during the wet month which is also the growing season this supports the potential link between wl decline and vc expansion and the implication that et has increased due to the increased vc in this month calling for further investigation of possible anthropogenic factors in the watershed driving the vc and associated et increases it also raises the question whether the required water for expansion of vc was supplied by over exploitation of groundwater resources overall the wet and dry trend results also indicate that observed climatic changes in terms of p and t are not the likely dominant drivers of the wl change trend in both wet and dry months may and july respectively the positive trend in wl in the years before 1995 is possibly due to high p events chaudhari et al 2018 however jalili et al 2015 showed that the positive trend of lake wl during 1966 and 1995 is not significant at a 95 confidence level further even with an observed spike in p in may 1986 2002 2004 2010 and 2013 wl decreased in these years it is noteworthy that wl in the lake is an integrated quantity that is wl fluctuations in a particular period e g during may and july are the integrated result of interactions between different hydro climatic components of the lake system in the previous months therefore a comprehensive comparison of the hydro climate variables requires lagged correlation analysis between these variables and lake wl as presented in section 4 3 in addition hydro climate variables are subject to seasonal cycles therefore the change attribution analysis has also been carried out for the standardized anomalies i e excluding the seasonal variations in order to reduce the influence of seasonal cycles long term average and standard deviation of data for each month of the year are used as baseline and for standardization respectively in anomaly computations results of the change attribution analysis of anomalies see figure s1 in supplementary materials are consistent with those of the original data which resolves the concern about the effects of seasonal variations in the hydro climate and vegetation variables 4 3 correlation analysis to further investigate the association between wl decline and changes in other hydro climatic variables correlation analysis is performed on the monthly averaged data across the time series during 1981 2015 long term correlations are presented in table 2 the results of all three correlation methods are consistent in terms of the degree of correlation and their associated statistical significance between hydro climatic variables given the nonlinear and complex nature of interactions between different hydro climatic processes in addition to simultaneous correlation lag time 0 we also examine lagged correlations 1 to 5 months lag between the variables for instance time lags particularly at the watershed scale between p and vc and or wl response can be expected herrmann et al 2005 wang et al 2003 therefore here we only present the results for lags with the highest ccs in table 2 vc lags five months behind p and sm and wl lags three months behind p and four months behind t sm and vc while no time lag is evident in correlations of other variables the highest short term pre and post change correlations comparing simultaneous and lagged ccs are presented in fig 11 for the short term correlations only the spearman ccs are presented and discussed as spearman correlation can capture any monotonic relationship both linear and non linear between variables unlike pearson correlation that can only detect linear ones wilks 2011 it should be further noted that non monotonic associations between the hydro climatic variables were not analyzed here which can be an interesting extension of this study 4 3 1 could any monotonic relationship between wl decline and p and or t variations be inferred theoretically and under normal conditions the lake wl goes up down with higher lower p with both a direct input to the lake p over the lake with a smaller contribution and an indirect one p transformed into q and eventually inflowing to the lake with a higher contribution increase in t is directly correlated with higher et rates which in turn result in wl reduction therefore some degree of monotonic relationship for wl p and wl t is expected there is a strong p t relationship consistent in both pre and post change periods during the pre change period there are weak and lagged monotonic relationships for wl p cc 0 25 with a 3 month lag and wl t cc 0 29 with a 4 month lag which are consistent with the expected physics of the lake wl fluctuations however during the post change period there is no monotonic relationship for wl p that is the relationship between p as input to the lake with wl as the lake s response has been disturbed the strength of wl t relationship during the post change period is weakened by almost 40 new cc 0 17 with the similar lag time of 4 months that reflects the possible impact of anthropogenic drivers of the lake wl during this period the wl t relationship in both wet and dry months is similar but stronger cc 0 52 and consistent with pre and post change see fig 12 without an increasing trend recorded for t it cannot be concluded that increased evaporation the lake s only output flux from the lake has driven the wl decline sima et al 2013 a slight change is seen in p t and sm vc relationships from pre to post change periods vc growth seems to be slightly more dependent on p t and sm in the pre change period one possible explanation for such a change could be the excessive withdrawal of groundwater resources as a replacement for surface waters recharged by p used for irrigation during the post change period that is consistent with the observed groundwater level decline joodaki et al 2014 vaheddoost and aksoy 2018 voss et al 2013 in the watershed 4 3 2 could any monotonic relationship between wl decline and vc variations be inferred an interesting observation is the inversion of a direct and simultaneous association of the pre change wl vc cc 0 31 to an inverse and lagged association cc 0 23 during the post change period although the strength of the relationship is moderate the inversion of this relationship is an important observation that is during the pre change period changes in the vc did not negatively impact the wl nonetheless the dramatic expansion of vc during the post change period as shown in figs 8 13 and 14 is associated with the wl decline the seasonal associations for the dry and wet months during the post change period further consolidates this observation wl vc exhibits a strong seasonal relationship cc 0 74 for both dry and wet months during the post change period the negative cc for wl vc signifying the negative effect of vc expansion on the lake wl supports the conclusion that the et increase associated with increased vc plays an important role in decreasing q and discharge into the lake in addition stone 2015 argued that farmers shift to more water demanding crops increased agricultural water demand and contributed to the shift in wl vc relationship by reducing q the 4 month lag for the wl vc relationship during the post change period may correspond to a number of factors including the propagation time to the lake water deficit created at the surface by water use for vegetation growth and or upstream reservoir operation policies water storage for agricultural irrigation and the differences in the seasonal cycles between these variables during 2000 2015 when wl in lake urmia has declined more than in any other time since the 1960s the wl vc relationship is negative vegetated areas were extended due to anthropogenic land use change and agricultural land developments in the watershed in this period while the lake lost a significant amount of water this inconsistency can be explained only by accounting for the amount of water used for agricultural activities in the watershed that increased vc at the expense of reducing lake inflows this relationship is again consistent with increases in the transpiration component and thereby the total et 4 4 agricultural growth and associated land water use changes as shown earlier the vc and agriculture in the lake urmia watershed have increased in recent decades mehrian et al 2016 in this section a detailed assessment of historical changes in the vc based on modis ndvi is presented figs 13 and 14 illustrate the changes in vc during the past 17 years in may histograms of ndvi frequency in the lake urmia watershed in may during 2001 to 2016 are shown in fig 13 with green bars for values above 0 4 classified as vegetation values ranging from 0 2 to 0 4 indicate a combination of soil rock urban areas and developed lands and the range of 0 2 to 0 1 is associated with land covered with water mostly the lake fig 14 middle illustrates relative annual changes in average ndvi values based on modis data as a measure of vc in the wet month may during 2001 2016 i e the plot shows the ratio of the year to year changes as percentage in the vegetated area of the watershed in may over this period the results show that vc in may was nearly doubled during the period 2000 2016 moreover fig 14 bottom illustrates that this major expansion in vc during 2010 2016 occurred in the march july season peaking in april may of each year with almost no relative change in other months since the march july season involves more intensive agricultural activities in the lake urmia watershed sharp inter annual variations and changes of vc in this season are likely associated with such activities vc increase can also be due to co2 enrichment that is the rise of atmospheric co2 concentration may lead to increased vegetation growth peel 2009 however available land cover classifications for the lake urmia watershed show that non irrigated vegetated areas have increased only slightly between 1987 and 2016 while irrigated vegetated areas cropland have increased substantially during this period chaudhari et al 2018 therefore it can be inferred that the co2 fertilization impact on vc increase is marginal compared to the impact of agricultural and irrigation expansions regardless of whether or not vc expansion is co2 driven increase in vegetation is associated with increased et since vegetation transpires and therefore needs more water for its transpiration this additional water use for transpiration affects to some degree depending on the magnitude of vegetation increase and its water use for transpiration the availability of remaining water in the watershed and the runoff to the lake and thereby the wl in the lake overall the results indicate a substantial increase in vc with associated transpiration and total et increase under stable t conditions and resulting decrease in q under stable p and sm conditions in the lake urmia watershed the subsequent reduced water discharge into the lake under aggressive land and water use changes required for the expansion of irrigated agriculture that has occurred in this watershed since the late 1990 s mehrian et al 2016 sigaroodi and ebrahimi 2010 can be therefore identified as the likely cause of the observed severe decline in the lake wl 5 conclusions understanding and distinguishing the atmospheric climate and human landscape drivers of major wl changes of drying lakes is a high research priority particularly for water resources management and planning clites et al 2014 these change drivers are also essential for management of other natural resources given the strong inter connection and inter dependency of water resources energy generation and food production especially in transboundary basins such as lake urmia destouni et al 2013 engström et al 2017 jaramillo and destouni 2015 keskinen et al 2016 madani and khatami 2015 stevens and madani 2016 tarroja et al 2014 in developing a change attribution approach for such wl changes we have investigated available records of hydro climatic and vegetation variables p t sm wl and vc for lake urmia and its watershed during the 1981 2015 period the statistical analysis has identified the year 2000 as the point of major change in wl leading to further analysis of the hydro climatic and vegetation characteristics within the two short term periods of pre change 1981 1999 and post change 2000 2015 given the stable conditions of p and t i e no statistically significant trends during both periods we conclude that these atmospheric climatic changes cannot explain the dramatic decline of wl in lake urmia since 2000 instead the inversion of the wl vc association from a positive monotonic relationship in the pre change period to a negative monotonic relationship in the post change period supports the hypothesis that regional human interventions in terms of agricultural and associated irrigation expansions are a primary cause of the lake desiccation this hypothesis is further supported by the overall and seasonal analysis of vegetation dynamics and land use changes over the lake urmia watershed increased agricultural crop transpiration and thus total et associated with the human driven increase in vc inherently including irrigation and water diversion and storage leading to decreased runoff and thus q from the watershed into the lake explains the dramatic wl decline in recent decades the impact of vc expansion on water availability in the watershed and lake urmia itself may be further investigated based on additional data for changes in the total water balance of the watershed during the pre and post change periods taking into account all main water fluxes and storage changes the study results are consistent with studies of other parts of the world in indicating landscape changes in human land use and water use as main drivers of water resource changes destouni et al 2013 jaramillo and destouni 2015 2014 those studies have also shown that additionally atmospheric climate change sustained changes in p and t may intensify or dampen water changes such as lake desiccation relative to those driven by land water use changes however for the desiccation of lake urmia available observations do not provide conclusive evidence for t and p changes can be considered as the primary causes of the lake drying so far 6 declarations of interest

6754,lake urmia a shallow endemic hypersaline lake in northwest iran has undergone a dramatic decline in its water level wl by about 8 m since 1995 the primary cause of the wl decline in lake urmia has been debated in the scientific literature regarding whether it has been predominantly driven by atmospheric climate change or by human activities in the watershed landscape using available climate hydrological and vegetation data for the period 1981 2015 this study analyzes and aims to explain the lake desiccation based on other observed hydro climatic and vegetation changes in the lake urmia watershed and classical exploratory statistical methods the analysis accounts for the relationships between atmospheric climate change precipitation p temperature t and hydrological soil moisture sm and wl and vegetation cover vc including agricultural crops and other vegetation changes in the landscape results show that p t and sm changes cannot explain the sharp decline in lake wl since 2000 instead the agricultural increase of vc in the watershed correlates well with the lake wl change indicating this human driven vc and associated irrigation expansion as the dominant human driver of the lake urmia desiccation specifically the greater transpiration from the expanded and increasingly irrigated agricultural crops implies increased total evapotranspiration and associated consumptive use of water inherently related to the irrigation and water diversion and storage developments in the watershed thereby the runoff from the watershed into the lake has decreased and the remaining smaller inflow to the lake has been insufficient for keeping up the previous lake wl causing the observed wl drop to current conditions keywords lake urmia climate change land use change anthropogenic change

studied from different standpoints leading to a contested debate between two main camps while some researchers consider the lake urmia retreat to be predominantly the outcome of the changing climate and a climate driven increase of droughts delju et al 2013 fathian et al 2015 others argue that similarly to other parts of the world destouni et al 2013 jaramillo and destouni 2015 2014 the lake may be suffering from aral sea syndrome aghakouchak et al 2015b implying that its current situation is not primarily due to purely atmospheric climate change although seasonal changes in the lake water level are strongly influenced by large scale atmospheric circulation patterns jalili et al 2012 different studies have attributed the decline in lake water content to extensive human activities in the

between the atmospheric climate change and the hydrological and various agriculture related human developments occurring over the watershed landscape the study involves a statistical analysis of

variables of land surface air temperature t and precipitation p the hydrological variables of soil moisture sm and lake water level wl and a vegetation coverage vc variable for the landscape of the lake urmia watershed for these main hydro climatic vegetation variables t p sm wl and vc an integrated correlation and trend analysis is conducted using monthly and seasonal data for 2000 2015 the developed approach in this study can be applied for better investigation of similar cases around the world 2 study area and data 2 1 study area lake urmia is a transboundary water system the lake itself is located between east azerbaijan and west azerbaijan provinces in northwest iran fig 1 with inflowing rivers originating in these two provinces and the kurdistan province to the south the lake watershed area is 51 867 km2 and contains 14 main inflowing rivers khatami 2013 lake urmia is a shallow terminal lake with depth varying from 5 to 16 m length in the s n direction of approximately 140 km and central point coordinates of 37 42 n 45 19 e the lake is located in a semi arid climate with mean annual p of about 357 mm fazel et al 2017 khalyani et al 2014 vaheddoost and aksoy 2017 and the mean annual t of about 11 c delju et al 2013 daily minimum t in the region ranges between 0 c and 23 c in winter and the daily maximum t can reach 39 c during summers based on measurements made at hydrometric stations located at the outlet of major reservoirs in the watershed the average water discharge into the lake decreased from 2112 to 750 mcm million cubic meters i e around 65 reduction between 1960 and 2010 khoshtinat et al 2015 the wl of the lake has also dropped significantly in recent decades from 1278 m above sea level m a s l in 1995 to 1270 m a s l water depth reduction of 8 m in 2014 khatami and berndtsson 2012 tourian et al 2015 zoljoodi and didevarasl 2014 2 2 climate data climatic conditions in the lake urmia watershed are assessed in terms of the main climate variables p and t which generally have significant implications for the hydrologic cycle and vegetation dynamics 2 2 1 precipitation three datasets are used here to analyze monthly p fig 2 these are the climate prediction center cpc merged analysis of precipitation cmap the global precipitation climatology project version 2 3 gpcp and the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr cmap is a product of the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa and provides average monthly data from 1979 to present with a spatial resolution of 2 5 2 5 noaa 2016a cmap data are derived from microwave and infrared observations from polar orbiting and geostationary satellites as well as gauge data analysis gpcp adler et al 2003 provides data with the same spatial and temporal resolution as cmap but uses geostationary infrared satellite imagery retrievals and different algorithms to estimate p persiann cdr daily mean p data is available from 1983 at a 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution this dataset primarily relies on satellite infrared observations and is corrected based on passive microwave information and ground based observations ashouri et al 2015 overall the three p data sets are consistent with respect to their mean daily p information persiann cdr and gpcp indicate that the average p in the lake urmia watershed is 1 4 mm day whereas cmap shows that the average p is 1 3 mm day to select the best p estimate for our study domain the triple collocation tc error characterization method stoffelen 1998 is applied to the three p estimates tc provides an estimate of the random error in three collocated estimates measurements of the same variable without assuming any of the three to be error free tc uses the covariance matrix of the three measurements and by assuming that the three measurements have independent random errors and uncorrelated random errors with the truth it calculates the variance of the random error in each measurement in addition tc also provides the correlation coefficient cc between each measurement and the truth detailed derivation of this technique is explained in mccoll et al 2014 tc has been applied to a wide range of environmental variables including sm p sea surface salinity and land water storage alemohammad et al 2015 draper et al 2013 parinussa et al 2011 ratheesh et al 2013 roebeling et al 2012 the three estimates of p are aggregated to a spatial resolution of 2 5 2 5 and then tc is applied to the aggregated monthly estimates of p between 1983 and 2016 during which all three datasets are available tian et al 2013 assumed the error structure of monthly p data to be additive based on which the classical extended triple collocation with additive error model mccoll et al 2014 is used here the analysis shows that gpcp has the smallest random error among the three and the highest correlation with the truth based on tc estimates the standard deviation of random error in gpcp persiann cdr and cmap is estimated to be 0 04 0 17 and 0 50 mm day respectively and their respective ccs are 0 99 0 97 and 0 63 moreover gpcp showed the highest correlation with the mean p estimates derived from the three measurements therefore gpcp is selected as the best data source for the analysis 2 2 2 temperature t data are extracted from another product of noaa noaa 2016b representing a combination of the global historical climatology network ghcn and the climate anomaly monitoring system cams datasets t ghcn cams this high resolution dataset provides global monthly t data from 1948 with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 it provides t estimates for land areas and is adjusted by comparison with observational data fan and van den dool 2008 based on monthly data the average t in the lake watershed is 9 99 c for the period 1948 2016 while the average t is 10 17 c for the period 2000 2016 the monthly average t time series is presented in fig 3 2 3 soil moisture data surface sm estimates are based on the european space agency esa climate change initiative cci program s soil moisture esa cci sm product this product blends sm observations from a suite of active and passive instruments and provides a data record of sm estimates for the period 1978 2015 liu et al 2012 2011 wagner et al 2012 here the daily data from the latest version version 3 2 of this product are used observations are aggregated to monthly values for analysis the spatial resolution of the data is 0 25 0 25 see fig 4 2 4 vegetation cover data during recent decades remote sensing imagery has provided a wide range of tools for monitoring the health and condition of vc especially for large scale studies in this regard several indices have been defined based on raw remotely sensed reflectance data for study of earth surface characteristics among which the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is a useful and well studied variable for vegetation study schultz et al 2016 tillack et al 2014 viña et al 2011 ndvi was first used by rouse et al 1974 and is calculated based on the response of vegetation to electromagnetic waves in red red and near infrared nir bands 1 ndvi n i r r e d n i r r e d ndvi is a dimensionless parameter and its value ranges between 1 and 1 generally values greater than 0 4 represent temperate and tropical rainforests while ndvi values between 0 2 and 0 4 indicate grassland negative low values near 1 normally refer to water and small values close to zero between 0 1 and 0 1 represent urban areas or areas covered by rock soil etc weier and herring 2000 as suggested by many studies e g delbart et al 2005 khazaei and wu 2018 nemani and running 1997 an ndvi value of 0 4 can be used as a threshold for distinguishing vegetation from other types of land cover this can be used to classify land into vegetated and non vegetated land cover types and thereby as basis for estimating vc in this study ndvi data are obtained from two us nasa datasets mod13q1 product of moderate resolution imaging spectrometer modis and normalized difference vegetation index 3rd generation using the global inventory monitoring and modeling system gimms modis13q1 is estimated from observations onboard the terra satellite didan 2015 nasa 2014a since february 2000 mod13q1 provides vegetation index values namely ndvi and enhanced vegetation index evi as well as blue blue red nir and mid infrared mir bands on an 8 day basis at a spatial resolution of 250 m evi is another commonly used vegetation index that estimates vegetation based on red nir and blue bands with improved sensitivity in highly vegetated areas huete et al 2002 ndvi and evi products provided by modis are computed from atmospherically corrected surface reflectance imagery data in which water clouds heavy aerosols and cloud shadows have been masked out despite its high resolution and abundant temporal availability modis ndvi data is not available prior to the year 2000 ndvi3g the latest version of gimms product nasa 2014b provides global estimates of ndvi in a daily format with a spatial resolution of 1 12 1 12 8 km between july 1981 and 2015 pinzon and tucker 2014 tucker et al 2005 ndvi3g is used for hydro climatic analyses including trend and correlation analysis during the 1981 2015 period see fig 5 as modis ndvi provides vc estimates with a higher resolution of 250 m modis ndvi is additionally used to evaluate the ndvi3g results on expansion reduction of vc in the lake urmia watershed after february 2000 the evaluation showed that vc estimates of modis ndvi and ndvi3g in the lake urmia watershed are strongly correlated cc 0 92 p value 0 00 during the 2000 2015 period any potential trend in net radiation could affect the ndvi estimates kustas et al 1993 hence the possible impact of net radiation on the vc estimates is examined over the lake urmia watershed nasa gewex srb product provides net radiation data globally between 1983 and 2007 nasa 2012 and ceres provides net radiation estimates worldwide since 2000 nasa 2017 srb and ceres data were merged to generate net radiation record for the period of 1985 2015 orth and seneviratne 2015 and no trend was detected in net radiation time series in this period 2 5 water level data two datasets are used for lake wl direct gauge observations and the global reservoirs lakes g realm dataset daily observations have been recorded at the golmankhane station 37 36 n 45 16 e since 1966 khatami 2013 p 17 and these data were obtained from the urmia lake restoration program ulrp g realm also provides wl estimates on a 10 day basis since 1992 g realm data are computed from topex poseidon t p5 jason 1 and jason 2 ostm altimetry usda 2017 fig 6 shows the wl variations of lake urmia for the period 1966 2016 although observed and remotely sensed wl fluctuations differ as shown in fig 6 their trends agree with each other in this study gauge observations are selected to analyze wl since they are on a daily basis and cover a longer period additionally using g realm to estimate wl could introduce errors uncertainties associated with the processing of the satellite data however there are also some measurement errors when observed data are used as wl estimates khazaei and hosseini 2015 3 methods 3 1 point of change detection a breakpoint towards a rapid decline around the mid 1990s is seen in the wl time series fig 6 the pettitt test pettitt 1979 is used to find the onset of the wl decline trend and split the wl time series into two shorter periods before and after the onset for the further hydro climatic analyses the pettit test is widely used for detecting points of abrupt changes or sharp variations in time series of physical variables fan et al 2012 rougé et al 2013 villarini et al 2009 yao et al 2015 for a given time series of continuous data x i i 1 2 3 n the test statistic ut n is calculated as 2 u t n u t 1 n v t n t 2 3 n where n is the sample size and 3 v t n i 1 n s g n x t x i a n d s g n x t x i 1 x t x i 0 x t x i 1 x t x i the location of the breakpoint kn in the time series is defined as 4 k n m a x u t n t 1 2 n the statistical significance of kn can be approximated by 5 p 2 e x p 6 k n 2 n 3 n 2 for low p values the null hypothesis h0 no change point exists can be rejected and there is a significant breakpoint that divides the time series into pre and post change parts 3 2 trend analysis 3 2 1 mann kendall test the mann kendall test kendall et al 1990 mann 1945 is a nonparametric method for evaluating the presence of a trend or non stationarity of the mean in a time series and has been widely used to analyze trends in hydrological variables ahn and merwade 2014 burn and hag elnur 2002 the test statistics smk can be defined as 6 s mk i 1 n j i 1 n s g n x j x i where for a time series x i i 1 2 3 n the time index i e g the year month etc of observation of each datum is monotonically increasing by definition which simplifies the calculations wilks 2011 p 166 each and every data point is sequentially treated as a reference point and is compared to all of the following data points douglas et al 2000 the function sgn xj xi is defined in eq 3 for n 8 smk follows an approximately normal distribution and its variance is calculated as 7 σ s mk 2 n n 1 2 n 5 18 the mann kendall test statistic zmk is calculated by 8 z mk s mk 1 σ s mk s mk 0 0 s mk 0 s mk 1 σ s mk s mk 0 the null hypothesis h0 no trend detected is rejected at 5 significance level p value 0 05 when zmk 1 96 then a positive value of zmk indicates a positive trend and a negative zmk value indicates a negative trend 3 2 2 seasonal kendall trend the mann kendall test does not account for seasonality and therefore the kendall seasonal trend method is also used hirsch and slack 1984 the test statistics are calculated using equations 9 to 11 9 s i 1 n k 1 j i 1 n k s g n x kj x ki a n d s sk k 1 n s where j i nk

that the trend is increasing a negative value signifies a decreasing trend and zero means no trend the trend is also significant at p value 0 05 when zsk 1 96 in the presence of seasonality in the data the value of zsk tends to be higher than zmk 3 3 correlation analysis the association inter dependency between different hydro climatic and vegetation variables is examined using pearson spearman and kendall ccs bevan 2013 kendall and maurice 1970 spearman and kendall ccs are robust not dependent upon the underlying distribution of the data and resistant not sensitive to extreme values alternatives to pearson cc wilks 2011 p 55 the values of all the above ccs range between 1 and 1 a negative correlation implies an inverse relationship between variables ratner 2009 3 4 change attribution approach an approach is developed for explaining i e attributing main drivers causes of the observed water changes within the classical paradigm of statistical analysis i e frequentist inference using an inverse approach changes in the records using trend analysis are first identified based on which hypotheses are formed to explain the changes the hypotheses are then evaluated based on observed associations between hydro climatic variables using correlation analysis to explain the changes through this approach the explanatory power of the commonplace exploratory statistical methods is used for change attribution using the available data for the studied hydro climatic and vegetation variables thus constituting a change attribution analysis while the spatial variability of each hydro climatic variable is aggregated into a single representative time series for the whole watershed the temporal variability is accounted for by performing the analysis across different time scales namely long term defined as the entire record and short term defined within each pre and post change period overall defined over the entire short or long term record and seasonal defined as wet and dry months in this study for representing intra annual periods with particular characteristics 4 results and discussions generating vc data is one of the outcomes of this study needed for the change attribution analysis first the vegetation dynamics results are presented section 4 1 followed by the discussion of the change attribution analysis results trends and correlations sections 4 2 and 4 3 the section concludes with a discussion of the role of land water use changes i e expansion of irrigation and agricultural growth in the lake s desiccation the statistically significant results are discussed although all results including the non significant ones are presented it should be noted that the statistical significance i e p value of a given statistic does not necessarily imply its importance or size effect that is in interpreting the results the p value is not a measure of how well or how much of the variation in a given variable is associated with the variation in another one wasserstein and lazar 2016 4 1 vegetation dynamics fig 7 shows the monthly average of each hydro climatic variable based on the common base period for all variables vc varies considerably in the watershed from spring april june to winter january march the best time of the year for plant growth in the region is late spring and early summer may july when t is moderate and p is maximum see fig 7 in winter rainfall amount is sufficient for plant photosynthesis but is mostly in the form of snow and t is too low that plant photosynthesis is limited june september are the hottest months of the year with the least rainfall vc decreases significantly from may onwards fig 8 further shows the spatial and temporal variations in vc expressed as ndvi within the lake urmia watershed in april july during 2000 2016 examination of the spatio temporal dynamics of vc fig 8 and green bars in fig 7 suggests that vegetation peaks in may based on available observations average t is estimated to be 13 c during this month while p is 1 7 mm day both at proper levels for plant growth thus may is selected as the wet month spell representative july beige bars in fig 7 is also selected as the dry month representative based on its low average p 0 5 mm day maximal average t 23 c i e the hottest month of the year and an expected low average vc it should be noted that august is also seemingly another candidate for the dry period representative but the magnitude and variability of vc is very low during august limiting the analysis of vc change spring particularly may is an important period for analyzing vc since vc variations mostly expansion has occurred at a faster rate during this time vegetation dynamics expressed as ndvi are known to be strongly correlated with soil water index and moisture profile zribi et al 2010 and with p gessner et al 2013 both ndvi and evi are used here to examine vc given their similar results only those based on ndvi are presented 4 2 trends analysis trends magnitude and statistical significance in the hydro climatic variables are analyzed across two different sets of time scales namely 1 short and long term periods and 2 seasonal and overall periods first long term trends in monthly records of the hydro climatic variables are calculated during 1981 2015 fig 9 and table 1 long term trends may be indicative of climate driven variations and can provide an overview of the hydro climatic characteristics of the watershed second short term trends for the two sub periods of pre change 1981 1999 and post change 2000 2015 are calculated these sub periods are defined based on the change point in the wl records detected as the year 2000 using the pettitt test it should be noted that the change point detection method as a non parametric analysis is dependent upon the sample size that is selecting the year 2000 as the cut off for pre and post change periods solely based on a statistical analysis is not sufficient this selection is further justified based on physical characteristics of the watershed and it is consistent with multiple studies that identified the mid to late 1990s as the period of major changes in the lake s watershed for instance chaudhari et al 2018 demonstrated that the impacts of human activities e g dam constructions and the expansion of urban and agricultural lands on the streamflow q inflowing to the lake were amplified beginning 1999 with the lowest annual average p within the period of 1979 2016 coinciding with a severe drought started in 1998 leading to a significant decrease in q into the lake alborzi et al 2018 have also demonstrated a significant decrease in q into the lake during the early 2000s due to the drought period of 1998 2002 and increased withdrawal of surface water resources to meet the potable and agricultural water demands during this period due to the fact that the existing autocorrelation in monthly records could bias trend results seasonal kendall trends are also calculated to evaluate the overall trends 4 2 1 is there a potential link between the changes in wl t and p no overall long term and short term both pre and post change trends are found for climatic variables p and t while the strong seasonal and overall trends of wl for the pre change period are increasing it exhibits a strong decreasing trend both seasonally and overall during the post change period due to the strength of the post change wl trends the long term trends seasonal and overall are also decreasing with a greater order of magnitude i e zmk and zsk for wl than the other hydro climatic variables no trend is detected in p records across the time scales although increasing seasonal trends are apparent in the long term and pre change short term t records no trend is detected in the post change period with severe declining trends in wl these observations on p and t trends contradict the proposition that lake urmia has been subjected to lower p and higher t during the past two decades that said the possible association between wl fluctuations and variability in p and t is further investigated in the next section 4 3 correlation analysis 4 2 2 is there a link between the changes in wl and vc although there is a positive seasonal trend in vc during both pre and post change periods the post change trend is stronger a greater order of magnitude in terms of the trend test statistic zsk due to the expansion of irrigation and agricultural activities discussed in section 4 4 given the high correlation found in other studies between vegetation increase and increase in total evapotranspiration et as well as the transpiration component in et orth and destouni 2018 the positive and steeper trend in the post change vc compared to its pre change trend implies increased transpiration and associated total et in this period over which the overall p t and sm levels remain essentially stable the observed increase in vc is also consistent with reports on expansion of agricultural lands and increased water withdrawal in the region ashraf et al 2017 chaudhari et al 2018 as a consequence of fundamental water balance in the watershed in analogy with similar previous findings e g for the aral sea desiccation destouni et al 2010 increased et due to intensive or inefficient irrigation under stable p and sm conditions means that runoff in the watershed and the associated discharge q into the lake must have decreased in this period leading to the observed wl decline by 8 m 50 of the maximum depth of the lake between 1995 and 2016 4 2 3 trends in wet and dry spells the hydro climatic changes in the wet and dry months may and july were also examined for potential dominant seasonal variations see fig 10 as shown in fig 10 the overall trends in may wet month and july dry month records are similar to the short and long term trends in the mean monthly time series while p t and sm either exhibit statistically non significant or almost near horizontal trends wl has seasonal decreasing trends although the vc records for the dry month are not statistically significant there is a dramatic increase during the wet month which is also the growing season this supports the potential link between wl decline and vc expansion and the implication that et has increased due to the increased vc in this month calling for further investigation of possible anthropogenic factors in the watershed driving the vc and associated et increases it also raises the question whether the required water for expansion of vc was supplied by over exploitation of groundwater resources overall the wet and dry trend results also indicate that observed climatic changes in terms of p and t are not the likely dominant drivers of the wl change trend in both wet and dry months may and july respectively the positive trend in wl in the years before 1995 is possibly due to high p events chaudhari et al 2018 however jalili et al 2015 showed that the positive trend of lake wl during 1966 and 1995 is not significant at a 95 confidence level further even with an observed spike in p in may 1986 2002 2004 2010 and 2013 wl decreased in these years it is noteworthy that wl in the lake is an integrated quantity that is wl fluctuations in a particular period e g during may and july are the integrated result of interactions between different hydro climatic components of the lake system in the previous months therefore a comprehensive comparison of the hydro climate variables requires lagged correlation analysis between these variables and lake wl as presented in section 4 3 in addition hydro climate variables are subject to seasonal cycles therefore the change attribution analysis has also been carried out for the standardized anomalies i e excluding the seasonal variations in order to reduce the influence of seasonal cycles long term average and standard deviation of data for each month of the year are used as baseline and for standardization respectively in anomaly computations results of the change attribution analysis of anomalies see figure s1 in supplementary materials are consistent with those of the original data which resolves the concern about the effects of seasonal variations in the hydro climate and vegetation variables 4 3 correlation analysis to further investigate the association between wl decline and changes in other hydro climatic variables correlation analysis is performed on the monthly averaged data across the time series during 1981 2015 long term correlations are presented in table 2 the results of all three correlation methods are consistent in terms of the degree of correlation and their associated statistical significance between hydro climatic variables given the nonlinear and complex nature of interactions between different hydro climatic processes in addition to simultaneous correlation lag time 0 we also examine lagged correlations 1 to 5 months lag between the variables for instance time lags particularly at the watershed scale between p and vc and or wl response can be expected herrmann et al 2005 wang et al 2003 therefore here we only present the results for lags with the highest ccs in table 2 vc lags five months behind p and sm and wl lags three months behind p and four months behind t sm and vc while no time lag is evident in correlations of other variables the highest short term pre and post change correlations comparing simultaneous and lagged ccs are presented in fig 11 for the short term correlations only the spearman ccs are presented and discussed as spearman correlation can capture any monotonic relationship both linear and non linear between variables unlike pearson correlation that can only detect linear ones wilks 2011 it should be further noted that non monotonic associations between the hydro climatic variables were not analyzed here which can be an interesting extension of this study 4 3 1 could any monotonic relationship between wl decline and p and or t variations be inferred theoretically and under normal conditions the lake wl goes up down with higher lower p with both a direct input to the lake p over the lake with a smaller contribution and an indirect one p transformed into q and eventually inflowing to the lake with a higher contribution increase in t is directly correlated with higher et rates which in turn result in wl reduction therefore some degree of monotonic relationship for wl p and wl t is expected there is a strong p t relationship consistent in both pre and post change periods during the pre change period there are weak and lagged monotonic relationships for wl p cc 0 25 with a 3 month lag and wl t cc 0 29 with a 4 month lag which are consistent with the expected physics of the lake wl fluctuations however during the post change period there is no monotonic relationship for wl p that is the relationship between p as input to the lake with wl as the lake s response has been disturbed the strength of wl t relationship during the post change period is weakened by almost 40 new cc 0 17 with the similar lag time of 4 months that reflects the possible impact of anthropogenic drivers of the lake wl during this period the wl t relationship in both wet and dry months is similar but stronger cc 0 52 and consistent with pre and post change see fig 12 without an increasing trend recorded for t it cannot be concluded that increased evaporation the lake s only output flux from the lake has driven the wl decline sima et al 2013 a slight change is seen in p t and sm vc relationships from pre to post change periods vc growth seems to be slightly more dependent on p t and sm in the pre change period one possible explanation for such a change could be the excessive withdrawal of groundwater resources as a replacement for surface waters recharged by p used for irrigation during the post change period that is consistent with the observed groundwater level decline joodaki et al 2014 vaheddoost and aksoy 2018 voss et al 2013 in the watershed 4 3 2 could any monotonic relationship between wl decline and vc variations be inferred an interesting observation is the inversion of a direct and simultaneous association of the pre change wl vc cc 0 31 to an inverse and lagged association cc 0 23 during the post change period although the strength of the relationship is moderate the inversion of this relationship is an important observation that is during the pre change period changes in the vc did not negatively impact the wl nonetheless the dramatic expansion of vc during the post change period as shown in figs 8 13 and 14 is associated with the wl decline the seasonal associations for the dry and wet months during the post change period further consolidates this observation wl vc exhibits a strong seasonal relationship cc 0 74 for both dry and wet months during the post change period the negative cc for wl vc signifying the negative effect of vc expansion on the lake wl supports the conclusion that the et increase associated with increased vc plays an important role in decreasing q and discharge into the lake in addition stone 2015 argued that farmers shift to more water demanding crops increased agricultural water demand and contributed to the shift in wl vc relationship by reducing q the 4 month lag for the wl vc relationship during the post change period may correspond to a number of factors including the propagation time to the lake water deficit created at the surface by water use for vegetation growth and or upstream reservoir operation policies water storage for agricultural irrigation and the differences in the seasonal cycles between these variables during 2000 2015 when wl in lake urmia has declined more than in any other time since the 1960s the wl vc relationship is negative vegetated areas were extended due to anthropogenic land use change and agricultural land developments in the watershed in this period while the lake lost a significant amount of water this inconsistency can be explained only by accounting for the amount of water used for agricultural activities in the watershed that increased vc at the expense of reducing lake inflows this relationship is again consistent with increases in the transpiration component and thereby the total et 4 4 agricultural growth and associated land water use changes as shown earlier the vc and agriculture in the lake urmia watershed have increased in recent decades mehrian et al 2016 in this section a detailed assessment of historical changes in the vc based on modis ndvi is presented figs 13 and 14 illustrate the changes in vc during the past 17 years in may histograms of ndvi frequency in the lake urmia watershed in may during 2001 to 2016 are shown in fig 13 with green bars for values above 0 4 classified as vegetation values ranging from 0 2 to 0 4 indicate a combination of soil rock urban areas and developed lands and the range of 0 2 to 0 1 is associated with land covered with water mostly the lake fig 14 middle illustrates relative annual changes in average ndvi values based on modis data as a measure of vc in the wet month may during 2001 2016 i e the plot shows the ratio of the year to year changes as percentage in the vegetated area of the watershed in may over this period the results show that vc in may was nearly doubled during the period 2000 2016 moreover fig 14 bottom illustrates that this major expansion in vc during 2010 2016 occurred in the march july season peaking in april may of each year with almost no relative change in other months since the march july season involves more intensive agricultural activities in the lake urmia watershed sharp inter annual variations and changes of vc in this season are likely associated with such activities vc increase can also be due to co2 enrichment that is the rise of atmospheric co2 concentration may lead to increased vegetation growth peel 2009 however available land cover classifications for the lake urmia watershed show that non irrigated vegetated areas have increased only slightly between 1987 and 2016 while irrigated vegetated areas cropland have increased substantially during this period chaudhari et al 2018 therefore it can be inferred that the co2 fertilization impact on vc increase is marginal compared to the impact of agricultural and irrigation expansions regardless of whether or not vc expansion is co2 driven increase in vegetation is associated with increased et since vegetation transpires and therefore needs more water for its transpiration this additional water use for transpiration affects to some degree depending on the magnitude of vegetation increase and its water use for transpiration the availability of remaining water in the watershed and the runoff to the lake and thereby the wl in the lake overall the results indicate a substantial increase in vc with associated transpiration and total et increase under stable t conditions and resulting decrease in q under stable p and sm conditions in the lake urmia watershed the subsequent reduced water discharge into the lake under aggressive land and water use changes required for the expansion of irrigated agriculture that has occurred in this watershed since the late 1990 s mehrian et al 2016 sigaroodi and ebrahimi 2010 can be therefore identified as the likely cause of the observed severe decline in the lake wl 5 conclusions understanding and distinguishing the atmospheric climate and human landscape drivers of major wl changes of drying lakes is a high research priority particularly for water resources management and planning clites et al 2014 these change drivers are also essential for management of other natural resources given the strong inter connection and inter dependency of water resources energy generation and food production especially in transboundary basins such as lake urmia destouni et al 2013 engström et al 2017 jaramillo and destouni 2015 keskinen et al 2016 madani and khatami 2015 stevens and madani 2016 tarroja et al 2014 in developing a change attribution approach for such wl changes we have investigated available records of hydro climatic and vegetation variables p t sm wl and vc for lake urmia and its watershed during the 1981 2015 period the statistical analysis has identified the year 2000 as the point of major change in wl leading to further analysis of the hydro climatic and vegetation characteristics within the two short term periods of pre change 1981 1999 and post change 2000 2015 given the stable conditions of p and t i e no statistically significant trends during both periods we conclude that these atmospheric climatic changes cannot explain the dramatic decline of wl in lake urmia since 2000 instead the inversion of the wl vc association from a positive monotonic relationship in the pre change period to a negative monotonic relationship in the post change period supports the hypothesis that regional human interventions in terms of agricultural and associated irrigation expansions are a primary cause of the lake desiccation this hypothesis is further supported by the overall and seasonal analysis of vegetation dynamics and land use changes over the lake urmia watershed increased agricultural crop transpiration and thus total et associated with the human driven increase in vc inherently including irrigation and water diversion and storage leading to decreased runoff and thus q from the watershed into the lake explains the dramatic wl decline in recent decades the impact of vc expansion on water availability in the watershed and lake urmia itself may be further investigated based on additional data for changes in the total water balance of the watershed during the pre and post change periods taking into account all main water fluxes and storage changes the study results are consistent with studies of other parts of the world in indicating landscape changes in human land use and water use as main drivers of water resource changes destouni et al 2013 jaramillo and destouni 2015 2014 those studies have also shown that additionally atmospheric climate change sustained changes in p and t may intensify or dampen water changes such as lake desiccation relative to those driven by land water use changes however for the desiccation of lake urmia available observations do not provide conclusive evidence for t and p changes can be considered as the primary causes of the lake drying so far 6 declarations of interest
