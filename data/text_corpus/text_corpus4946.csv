24730,the study of production living ecological space ples is essential for the sustainable use of land resources and regional socioeconomic development and several studies have adopted ples based evaluation indices however few studies have investigated the effects of governmental regulation and human activity on the optimal allocation of land for different uses crucially the non optimal use of land by urban decision makers leads to multiple problems including wasting potential land resources and trade offs between economic development and environmental protection therefore in this study we developed a multi spatial agent based optimisation model msabom coupled with a multi agent system mas within a machine learning framework the msabom determines spatially optimised land use solutions based on the small scale land use preferences of stakeholders and addresses conflicts in the sub optimal allocation of resources based on the behaviours of model agents and the decision making environment the yanbian korean autonomous prefecture in china was used as a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach the results show that 1 the msabom can significantly improve the optimisation of ples improving the land utilisation rate by 1 22 times 2 based on an understanding of existing practices the optimal allocation plan obtained by the agent based model is more suitable than that obtained by a non agent based model 3 multi functional land use patterns can be optimally allocated in space and time which is extremely useful for coordinating stakeholder participation and addressing conflicts of interest in land use behaviours and 4 an urban spatial development coefficient was successfully used to determine the dominant function and functional positioning of ples which helps ensure flexible development strategies for spatial planning keywords land use optimisation production living ecological space spatial decision making support multi agent system geographic information system 1 introduction the optimisation of land use is crucial for sustainable regional development and environmental protection gao et al 2010 kim et al 2009 scarborough et al 2012 sommer et al 2015 however globally rapid industrialisation and urbanisation have caused a series of social and environmental issues including the wasteful use of resources and ecological degradation with the continuous expansion of urban and rural construction land conflicts between urban agricultural and ecological spaces have become increasingly prominent especially in developing countries such as china thorne et al 2013 wang et al 2018 ye et al 2017 urbanisation in developed western countries shows that when the level of urbanisation reaches 50 problems including uncoordinated urban and rural development uneven regional development and conflicts between economic development and ecological protection therefore spatial planning has emerged as an essential tool for promoting sustainable development cai et al 2014 at the end of 2018 59 6 of china s land was urbanised and the country entered a period of steady urbanisation wang et al 2018 therefore a shift in spatial planning is needed towards a model based on the harmonious coexistence of humans and nature thus limited space resources must be rationally allocated while still promoting regional sustainable development and this has become a major scientific challenge duh and daniel 2007 liu and liu 2014 liu et al 2012b wang and zhu 2015 ples is the products of the synergistic coupling of natural systems and socioeconomic systems huang et al 2017 in 2010 china s national land functional zone plan categorised dominant functional zones according to the type and nature of their development and established a basic framework for land development at the third plenary session of the 18th central committee of the communist party of china xi jinping further proposed that a spatial planning system should be established to limit unrestricted development and promote the careful management of ples in 2017 china s national land planning outline was released and specific arrangements were made for the development of different regions functional areas and development goals huang et al 2017a 2017b liu et al 2017 ye et al 2017 effectively delineating ples especially for the conversion of ecological agricultural and urban space use at the city level is an effective means of optimising land use and achieving a sustainable society at the regional scale huang et al 2017 jiang et al 2013 qi and he 2015 ye et al 2017 currently ples research focusses on defining concepts identifying functional spaces constructing evaluation indices developing optimisation methods and considering the wider implications of the concept and the ples framework huang et al 2017 for example the spatial temporal pattern of ples in china between 1990 and 2010 was studied by liu et al 2017 and a urban rural land ecological production living carrying capacity index and accounting model have since been developed fang et al 2017 selected indicators were identified to build an evaluation index and analyse the coupling and coordination of rural ples functions in chongqing wang and tang 2018 in 2015 an evaluation index and evaluation model were developed for the optimisation of ples and the overall quality of the ples in 289 prefectures and cities was analysed accounting for their different characteristics and spatial distributions liu and shun 2020 nevertheless ples based land use optimisation research is still developing especially at the city level in particular there is a lack of in depth research on the potential benefits of coupling urbanisation and eco environmental theory as the foundation for land use optimisation within the ples framework recently research has been conducted to better understand land use optimisation including top down and bottom up land use optimisation models bennett et al 2004 liu et al 2012a xiao 2008 top down models focus on global optimisation goals consider the overall situation of the area of interest and mathematically assign different land use types to different land parcel units to generate a series of optimal solutions leung and wang 2001 these models usually combine certain optimisation methods with multi objective optimisation techniques to establish an optimal allocation model of land use aerts et al 2003 for example a structural land use optimisation model was established by xin and xiaodong 2017 to promote the effectiveness of land use planning in china furthermore machine learning frameworks have been used to establish spatial optimisation rules for landscape patterns to optimise the spatial arrangement of agricultural landscapes wang 2009 a spatial optimisation model of land use for the yellow river delta nature reserve was constructed by gong et al 2017 from which three target driven schemes were designed to balance ecological protection and economic development however these models do not consider the impacts of human activity on the ecological environment some human activities can lead to a decrease in ecosystem services which directly threatens the ecological foundation of sustainable human development brown et al 2005 thus the msabom is effective for formulating appropriate policies and implementing effective control measures to maximise ples and help balance socioeconomic development whilst minimising environmental damage bottom up models mainly simulate the decision making process and small scale changes in land use li and yeh 2005 for example genetic algorithm ga and cellular automata ca models have been combined with geographical information systems giss grimm et al 2006 to establish urban spatial pattern optimisation models he et al 2006 stewart et al 2004 wang et al 2004 zhang et al 2016 developed a multi objective land use optimisation allocation model based on a multi agent system mas and a loosely coupled model based on gas and game theory was constructed by liu et al 2015 that utilises multi stakeholder games and knowledge of land use planning to address local scale land use competition however the evaluation of the dynamic effects and adjustments of allocation schemes for continuous timeframes is particularly difficult these various models have made significant contributions to the study of spatial land use optimisation however they have certain limitations therefore it is of great importance to establish a spatial optimisation model that accounts for human activity within ples and which is flexible enough to address the land use allocation needs of complex areas generally both top down and bottom up models have intrinsic limitations impeding the optimum land use allocation santé riveira et al 2008 therefore it is necessary to combine both models to overcome their respective defects and obtain reasonable optimization results here we use a bayesian network bn top down model and a mas as the bottom top model in gis science bn modelling is a supervised machine learning method and is an effective way to integrate fuzzy prior knowledge frayer et al 2014 lüscher et al 2009 marcot et al 2006 pollino et al 2007 bns can integrate dynamic land changes i e prior knowledge and the factors that affect the status quo i e observed data combining structured learning with parameter learning plays an important role in assessing the probability that complex factors and events will occur as an excellent bn inference algorithm the junction tree algorithm jta transforms a directed graph into a tree reduces computational requirements and improves the accuracy of models braun and möller 2016 jin et al 2018 ou et al 2019 paskin 2003 as a route to sustainable development this approach can quickly and effectively improve the dynamic self adjustment potential of land use models and identify pathways for optimal space and land use transitions madsen and jensen 1999 namasivayam et al 2006 furthermore mas is an effective method for simulating multi level land use allocation and it is often used to solve complex spatial pattern optimisation allocation problems chen et al 2010 yeh 2006 currently ecological economic models mainly focus on the balance between homogeneous economic agents and heterogeneous interacting economic agents and their associated trade offs akopov et al 2016 filatova et al 2009 grimm et al 2006 for example agent based urban land markets are one factor driving changes in urban land use filatova et al 2009 the heterogeneity introduced in agent based models abms the representation of the land market process and the ability to measure the outputs of a large number of models can significantly enhance the understanding of urban land use change huang et al 2014 grimm et al 2006 proposed an overview design concepts and detailed odd information including the purpose state variables scale and seven other elements as a standard protocol for individual and agent based models this study is based on homogeneous economic entities i e human agents and heterogeneous agents i e government regulators with their own economic goals land use policy is used to restrict and regulate members of society during the development use governance protection and management of land resources within a country or region belsare and gompper 2015 bert et al 2015 frederik et al 2016 many stakeholders often make land use decisions in dynamic geographical environments in fact there may be a complex relationship between agent behaviour and decision making environments therefore in this study we sought to couple a mas approach with adaptive learning capabilities to address ples optimisation problems in which agent behaviours are learned and the emerging conflicts of interest between human activity and the land use policy can be better coordinated this study aims to construct a new model that simulates ples for land use optimisation at the city level based on city scale ples division theory methodological research and a quality evaluation framework the points of interest poi from the amap services are used to identify ples a jta based bn and mas are coupled to learn governmental decisions and human behavioural preferences and thereby simulate ples for land use optimisation dynamic land use changes and ecological suitability data are applied to explore the impacts of urbanisation and ecological environments on ples optimisation moreover we explore the trade offs between production space and living space and the combination of ecological space quantities and spatial land use layouts we also discuss the opportunities for urban spatial pattern development plans our findings help further establish the framework and motivations for developing a production living ecological functional space and provide a basis for optimising urban development 2 materials 2 1 study area the united nations development programme launched the development of the tumen river regional initiative in 1995 this is an important initiative by the northeast asian government which is in intergovernmental cooperation with the transportation energy tourism investment and environmental industries since the tumen river regional cooperation plan proposed the yanbian korean autonomous prefecture as the gateway and frontier of the tumen river regional cooperation area has become the most well connected zone between china and central asian countries cotton 1996 the region is also one of the most important ecologically functional areas in china jin and yujin 2001 yanbian is an offshore frontier that covers an area of 433 000 km2 and faces the sea of japan located in the eastern jilin province of china fig 1 and on the border with russia and korea yanbian has certain geographical advantages that have allowed the development of an export oriented economy yanbian is a key national ecological barrier area and an important hub for land sea transport to europe north america and asia chen et al 2009 colin 2003 yanbian has seven ports that face north korea and one facing russia and therefore provides an important gateway for the national one belt and one road strategy debin and yahua 2015 additionally the region is an important area for wildlife and has several zones containing the highest levels of temperate zone biodiversity in the northern hemisphere the national park for amur tigers and leopards supports the largest population of siberian manchurian tigers and amur leopards in china in the prefecture and is the most important habitat and breeding area for these species feng et al 2017 more than 70 of the park lies within the study area therefore to develop and open up the tumen river area developmental conflicts between the border economy and ecological protection must be resolved which necessarily requires an effort to determine the limits of urban growth 2 2 data sources we extracted poi data a total of 21 102 points from the amap service in 2019 a range of data was obtained for each poi including administrative details and ples categories table 1 we focussed on the following three dimensions to evaluate the quality of urban ples and form a theoretical framework i production spaces as a function of intensive input and efficient output ii living spaces that are comfortable convenient safe and healthy and iii ecological green spaces production spaces e g production transportation and commerce of material products for human beings were directly obtained as a working object and also included social production to incorporate the benefits of various products and service functions including productive services and transportation spaces qi and he 2015 living spaces e g residential areas retail areas and science education and cultural areas which include domestic service industry spaces refer to the land that carries various materials and spiritual functions that are provided by the land during the developmental process wang 2011 ecological spaces also provide ecosystem services to human beings including public garden spaces and scenic spots leng et al 2004 digital elevation models dem were obtained from the geospatial data cloud service http www gscloud cn data relating to water conservation eco environmental sensitivity ecosystem services and soil erosion were obtained from different local government departments land use cover maps 30 m spatial resolution for 2009 and 2017 were provided by tsinghua university http data ess tsinghua edu cn these datasets were rasterised into 1500 1500 m cells the target year for space optimisation in the study region was selected as 2035 3 modelling methods the msabom coordinates the quantity and spatial patterns of ecological and human activities for the decision making process by understanding the driving forces of regional spatial changes to maximise ples additionally the model can evaluate the dynamic effects of allocation schemes and integrate multi agents and bns to optimise spatial patterns in terms of quantity and structure and promote sustainable goals for ecological and urban development 3 1 model variables two dimensional grids of m n spatial units were created to allocate k types of spatial pattern definitions 3 2 objective functions the msabom aims to address the spatial distribution goals and constraints by reallocating decision variable values the decision maker controls the developmental coefficients to determine a region s predominant expected space development trend based on eq 1 for example in this study we selected six different spatial development models to determine whether the expected development in the study area could be considered a production space led development or an ecological space led development see section 3 3 we evaluated the intensive degree of ples using eqs 2 to 4 the weighted sum method was then used to combine these three functions into a composite function the objective function for optimising ples is as follows 1 m a x f w 1 s p w 2 s l w 3 s e 2 s p i 1 m j 1 n k 1 3 q p i j k p p i j k 3 s l i 1 m j 1 n k 1 4 q l i j k p l i j k 4 s e i 1 m j 1 n k 1 2 q e i j k p e i j k where w1 w2 and w3 are the developmental coefficients of the production space living space and ecological space respectively and are determined by the city spatial planner the range of w1 w2 and w3 was 0 1 which satisfies w1 w2 w3 1 qpij k qlij k and qeij k are the kernel density values for the spatial type j in the grid i j and ppij k plij k and peij k represent the probabilities of conversion to the spatial type j in the grid i j 3 3 constraint conditions 3 3 1 spatial patterns to prevent the excessive growth of urban land e g transportation and industrial land occupation of natural ecological space and reductions in ecological quality rules were formulated to ensure the orderly growth of urban land and prevent the development of unrestricted urban sprawl as part of this the edge evaluation state evs was introduced to determine whether an existing space unit is included in the optimisation by identifying whether an adjacent unit contains an ecological policy restriction see section 3 4 1 for details as follows 5 evs 1 i f s t i j c 0 i f s t i j c where 6 s t i j i j s i j 7 c n 2 here stij is the total number of units containing ecological policy restrictions around the unit i j and n is the number of spatial units neighbouring unit i j when evs 1 the space unit will fill the construction land outward along the original boundary when evs 0 there is a high probability that the space will occupy the protected ecological space and the simulation is stopped 3 3 2 forest cover approximately 80 8 of the study area consists of forest therefore according to the chinese forest protection policy that prohibits logging the forest cover constraint given below was used in the model to ensure that areas with forest cover made up the largest proportion of land use types 8 s e f s e k where sef is the area of forested land at the end of the planning period and sek is the area of land use type k at the end of the planning period 3 3 3 land use quantity and structure the total area of all land use types in the study area was limited to a planned target using land use quantity and structure constraints for example the area of regional ecological land had to be greater than the area of protected ecological land therefore the area of newly developed urban land had to remain below the upper limit of urban expansion expressed as follows 9 m i n o s o m a x o where so is the total area of all land use types in the study area and min o and max o are the upper and lower limits respectively of a specific land use type 3 3 4 region regional constraints included a total area constraint which referred to the total learning area of the grid and could not be changed and an administrative boundary integrity constraint that excluded land use types located outside the study area from the calculations 3 3 5 population the population constraint specified that the size of the regional population must not exceed the expected population size of the study area expressed as below 10 d 1 s u d 2 s f p where d1 is the average population density of urban land d2 is the average population density of agricultural land su is the area of urban land sf is the area of agricultural land and p is the expected population size of the study area 3 3 6 market economy market economy constraints were used to account for local government requirements for land use planning specifically at the end of the planning period the areas of urban industrial mining and transportation land must have increased and the area of unused land must have decreased gradually as follows 11 s s k s s l where k represents the land use type i e urban industrial mining or transportation land ssk is area of a specific land use type at the end of the planning period and ssl is the area of a specific land use type at the beginning of the planning period the following condition also had to be met 12 s e k s e l where sek is the unused land area at the end of the planning period and sel is the unused land area at the beginning of the period 3 4 multi agent decision making rules governments and human beings were the two main stakeholders and both have significant impacts on the spatial allocation of urban resources governmental departments formulate macro land use policies and ecological protection strategies including the protected ecological land to control the unlimited development of urban spaces bai et al 2016 bai et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 as a competitor for urban space human beings use land resources as production and living spaces which in turn affects ecological patterns here two types of agents were designed to simulate stakeholder participation and decision making behaviours in urban space allocation namely policy agents agentp and human agents agenth 3 4 1 agentp decision making rules each governmental planning department has an impact on land use through resource management and space development regulations in china the ministry of natural resources being responsible for the management of various types of land resources is the decision maker for land use planning other departments including the ministry of ecology and environment and the ministry of agriculture are responsible for formulating regulations or sub regulations for different space resources regulations made by these departments can encourage restrict or prohibit human construction activities the decision making process and subsequent behaviours of policy agents are affected both by ecological suitability and land dynamic changes li et al 2018 wang and jiang 2014 ecological suitability factors reflect wide ranging ecological land use conditions including natural conditions land quality and location factors that are important for ecological protection the natural conditions included in the model included gradient topography dem relief amplitude water conservation and the distance to a nature reserve and waterbody land quality factors included eco environmental sensitivity the importance of ecosystem services and the degree of soil erosion and location factors included the distance to a railway township or road and reflect the impacts that construction and transportation have on ecologically important land therefore a defined policy agent can be expressed as follows 13 a g e n t p a g p p 1 p i k 0 5 2 p i k 0 5 where agpp represents the governmental control actions of the ith cell in space k where 1 indicates the government prohibits any construction actions and 2 indicates that the government encourages construction and pik indicates the probability between 0 and 1 of forbidden construction in the ith cell of space k pik values were assigned based on the resource management and control policies of different departments a bn was used to learn the experience of experts and government policymakers to determine the probability of space control the policy agents accounted for the ecological redline strategy implemented by the ministry of ecology and environment and the urban space control plans implemented by the ministry of natural resources fig 2 also see eq 15 in section 3 5 3 4 2 agenth decision making rules a broad range of human agents including experienced experts and land users have an important influence on production living and ecological spaces primarily motivated by a desire to survive develop and improve living standards experts provide rich theoretical knowledge to determine the space quota coefficient for land user behaviour land users reflect the small scale processes of participatory land use which was accounted for in the mode by searching for various types of land use in the city including parkland and residential productive and domestic service industries the production spaces were jointly determined by agents with insurance finance transportation facilities and corporate attributes ecological spaces were determined by agents using the attributes of public gardens and scenic spots and living spaces were determined by agents using the attributes of residential and retail services and science education and culture services using this approach for urban spatial patterns as controlled by agpp the space quota for each human activity was determined using eq 14 and the influence of each sub factor was determined using an analytic hierarchy process ahp as follows 14 a g e n t h a g h s s 1 s c s w s where cs is the density of each of the factors ws is the weighting of each factor s and aghs is the intensity of human activity in cell space s 3 5 jta based bn with agent based optimisation bayesian network models are different from other optimisation algorithms as they can express the conditional dependence between factor variables as a function of topology in combination with the conditional probability of the factor giving a joint probability for all factor nodes dong et al 2012 tsamardinos et al 2006 additionally bns can combine qualitative and quantitative analyses by combining prior knowledge with sample data and integrating policy controls and expert experience our jta based bn model learned the behavioural rules of the agents and derived the optimal spatial solution for urban human activity as fig 3 shows the jta framework for reasoning in the bn model with the multi agent optimisation system consists of the three following steps step 1 discretisation consists of discrete event variables discrete criteria and a range of values according to the nature break method in arcgis software step 2 training and learning experience uses the agent based method to train and learn the rules of the control and human activity spaces in an area and obtains the joint probability distribution of multi target agents as expressed by eq 15 15 p x j x n j 1 n p x j p a r e n t s x j where p xj parents xj represents the conditional probability table of node xj finally step 3 message spread involves the jta based transform of the bn into an undirected tree and allows the message to complete the transmission process on the undirected tree which infers the probability distribution of random variables in the bn creating a junction tree jt requires moralisation and triangulation paskin 2003 the main purpose of the jta is to transform the bn into a second structure ss and obtain the exact results of the bn reasoning by inferring ss 16 s s j t p p where jt c s is a jt in which c is a clique in the bn s is an edge in the jt and pp is the probability potential with the clique and edge after transformation parameters for all the nodes in the jt must be specified i e the jt must be initialised namasivayam et al 2006 messages can then be transmitted within the jt by transmitting messages via all nodes the jt is globally consistent and the probability distribution of a random variable v can be calculated as follows 17 p v c v ϕ c 18 p v e p v e v p v e where p v is the probability distribution of variable v under clique c and p v e is the probability distribution of v following the inclusion of new evidence e in the jt steps 2 and 3 can be repeated until the required accuracy of the simulation results is reaches the policy agents agenth and human agents agentp identified in eq 13 and eq 14 train and teach the model and function as prior knowledge data the probability of each variable is incorporated into eqs 2 4 to obtain the spatial pattern of ples and the optimal allocation plan of ples is obtained using eq 1 4 results 4 1 model validation we evaluated the accuracy of the model by calculating the area under the curve auc and the receiver operating characteristic sommer et al 2015 this was done by dividing the data into training and test datasets for this we divided the resulting grid network into an average of three groups and 2 000 grids were randomly selected from each as the validation dataset and the remaining grids were used as the training dataset to calculate the auc and roc we set the threshold of 0 6 positive classes with probabilities 0 6 and negative classes with probabilities 0 6 were then obtained a set of corresponding coordinates were calculated as false positive fpr and true positive rates so that the corresponding coordinate points could be obtained in the plane by repeating three rounds of cross validation the auc values were calculated as shown in fig 4 the average accuracy of the model was 88 3 4 2 multi agent instantiation information for each department in the study area was collected to determine the governmental control behaviour of the policy agents this includes the ecological red line demarcation area issued by local governments and the urban space management control plans formulated by the natural resources department urban space management zones reflect three levels i restricted development ii conditional development and iii priority development fig 5b according to the ecological red line plan area 22 524 km2 we simulated the ecological red line spatial control region based on the policy agent decision model fig 5a and implemented this using agentp fig 5c the behaviour rules of the human agents were established through poi data for land user behaviour the spatial distribution of human activity was obtained from the poi kernel density data points the human agent model consisted of 13 factors including policy agent control results that were in line with governmental decisions two factors public gardens and scenic spots determined the ecological space pattern three factors insurance finances transportation facilities and corporate enterprises determined the production space pattern and four factors residential services retail services science education and culture and living services determined the living space pattern thus the spatial distribution of policy agents and human agents in 2035 was obtained using the msabom fig 5 and fig 6 4 3 simulation results six space optimisation allocation schemes which were used by urban planners to provide a reference for the optimal allocation of urban spatial patterns were determined as shown in table 2 and fig 7 s1 was designed as a contrasting treatment scheme and the solution does not include human activities or government control decisions but includes the allocation of influential ples factors considering the synergy between the policy agents and human agents models s2 s6 were designed as experimental processing methods the comparison of s1 and s2 s6 allowed us to assess the impact of policy agents on the optimal allocation of production space living space and ecological space in s2 s6 the combination of behavioural rules with machine learning allowed us to assess the impacts of urban development in instances with different priorities ples development priorities in the experiment the programme predicts six optimal allocation space patterns by training a multi agent model and learning from prior information the results are shown in fig 7 where f was determined according to the objective function defined in eq 1 the simulation results show that the final order of the preferred schemes was 2 4 6 3 5 and 1 fig 8 s1 is an unrealistic situation as it assumes that governmental regulations will not have any impacts on space allocation the results from s3 and s5 are consistent which means that developing living spaces is not the best urban planning strategy for yanbian the results for s4 show that priority is given to the development of ecological spaces the coordinated development of production and living spaces is an alternative scenario that maximises production living and ecological spaces for human activities both s2 and s6 prove that on the premise of giving priority to the development of production spaces the development of ecological spaces is more important than the development of living spaces which is similar to the adopted development plan for the research area this means that governmental decision making and human activities have resulted in similar outcomes to the ples optimisation method based on the policy and the human agents s2 is therefore a suitable solution for optimal space allocation in the study area for the next 20 years 4 4 optimisation performance evaluation by superimposing the land use spatial layout map before and after optimisation we found that optimised ples improved the land utilisation rate by 1 22 times the land use rates of cultivated land and construction land were greatly improved fig 9 the area of all land use types was redistributed through the optimisation model table 3 the area of arable land woodland grassland and construction land in the key development areas increased the area of bare land decreased and the area of water remained unchanged overall the model produced effective optimisation results from improving land use rates and allocating ples as fig 10 shows the spatial layout before and after optimisation was in line with actual trends for example the key developmental area is located in the innermost zone of the city within the suburbs where both population and industry are concentrated the prohibited construction area is in the outermost zone of the city which has the largest forest capacity however the allocation of land use after optimisation was more in line with the optimisation goal for example the optimised allocation area in the key development area was higher before optimisation which indicates that economic development and ecological protection were inconsistent the suitability of living space needs to be improved in the innermost population zone of the city in general for stakeholders non optimal land use wastes ples resources reduces the intensity of land use in the region and results in the inability to coordinate the development of the regional economy ecology and society the optimised land use allocation model is more in line with the actual decision making preferences of land users in other words the small scale land use preferences of stakeholders are well integrated into the optimisation process the optimised ples can guide the development of land by allocating resources in different regions and using land types under the legal supervision of land use related policies our approach represents a space optimisation model including the allocation of space for intensive and efficient production favourable social space and green and safe ecological space 4 5 spatial layout of optimal solutions analysing the distribution of urban spatial patterns in the optimal allocation plan can inform developmental strategies for different counties and cities governmental decisions and human activities were integrated into the optimisation process so that the optimisation results will likely be more widely accepted as the best option solution s2 was reclassified into the following four categories key optimal general and prohibited development areas as shown in fig 11 the overall distribution space pattern for yanbian shows the characteristic of multi core development in the central urban area and each of the optimal areas is explained in detail in the following sections 4 5 1 key development areas these areas are mainly concentrated in urban areas that cover 520 km2 including yanji dunhua longjing tumen and hunchun yanji longjing and tumen are contiguously clustered and the development zones are encouraged key and optimal development areas from yanji towards longjing and tumen consisting of 14 1 of the total area in the yanji longjing tumen region this is in line with the yanji longjing tumen integration strategy dunhua is one of the node cities for the changchun jilin tumen development and opening pilot zone due to its superior transportation and rich commercial and trading resources dunhua has become the second largest development area in yanbian as the gateway to the tumen river region the hunchun border economic cooperation zone will gradually become more competitive for industry including multi border cooperative industrial parks international logistics and multinational tourism these areas will have a solid economic foundation strong carrying capacity for resources and the environment and significant developmental potential that focusses on production living and ecological development 4 5 2 optimal development areas the optimal development areas cover 1 280 km2 and are located mainly in the suburbs of the yanji longjing area dunhua and wangqing as the size of each city expands the number of construction sites and overall investment increases and production and living space gradually become more developed it is noteworthy that the changbai mountain scenic spot in southwest yanbian also has a strong driving effect on external cities it is therefore necessary to consider the coordinated development of ecological protection and production spaces while developing the tourism industry 4 5 3 general development areas general development areas are mainly located in the outermost zone of each city and cover 5 136 km2 in these partitions the capacity of agricultural land is high to protect agricultural land it is necessary to improve agricultural development in the suburbs in terms of efficiency ecology and safety moreover it is necessary to focus on the development of green organic agricultural products strengthen land remediation and promote the centralised and continuous use of farmland which improves land resource utilisation efficiency and labour productivity by using modern technology the development of living spaces and production spaces should also be coordinated and matched with the development of ecological spaces and agricultural production 4 5 4 prohibited development areas prohibited development areas cover 38 636 km2 or 87 4 of the total land area and consist of all types of natural and cultural resource protection zones these were established at various levels and other critical ecological function zones requiring special protection were prohibited from industrial and urban development these mainly include the hunchun siberian tiger national nature reserve the changbai mountain national nature reserve the tianfozhishan national nature reserve and the zhenfengling national nature protected area as well as other nature reserves water reserves and government prohibited development areas 5 discussion spatial optimisation is a complex spatial and socioeconomic decision making process arika 2017 our proposed msabom solves two challenging issues related to the conflicts of interest between governmental land use regulations and human activity preferences furthermore linking human activity preferences to land space remains a challenge li et al 2016 using functions to simulate these complex behaviours in a way that accounts for the rational planning of ples based on sectoral regulations and regional natural social and economic conditions is difficult however this can be achieved by using machine learning methods to train and learn realistic decision making as a set of quantitative rules in a bn model this mechanism guides the process of optimal space allocation through behaviour preference rules and promotes human activities for participation in urban space planning additionally the spatial pattern of human activities based on poi can be used in mass to more accurately identify regional productive living and spatially dominated functional patterns that provide ecological products and services ye et al 2011 thus machine learning provides an effective method for empirical learning when based on multiple samples used for training and simulation our experiments show that accounting for human activities is crucial for the spatial planning of multi functional areas which in turn affects patterns of ples and ultimately sustainable development the mas approach combines governmental decision making behaviours with human activities which have proved to be a particularly challenging issue shi et al 2006 establishing a governmental decision making policy agent and a human agent that embodies human preferences can help capture the rational land use behaviour of land users in line with corresponding regulations in china regulations and environmental protection policies are formulated by the government s ministry of natural resources and ministry of environment and ecological protection which were used as regulatory conditions in the multi agent model additionally the jta based algorithm utilises bn reasoning for governmental department decision learning and expresses land use restrictions for each land unit as probability values this approach can determine whether each land block is forbidden by the jta or whether development is encouraged as one of the input variables for the bn the e cological suitability factor allows the model to ensure that land use activities abide by the relevant policies and retains maximum ecological service value li et al 2018 for human agents the experience of nine experts was used as a weighting factor in eq 14 and a spatial pattern that balances each type of human activity function was used to derive prior probability factors for the model in this way the ples in the research area was simulated by adjusting the relative spatial importance values schemes 1 to 6 represent different space optimisation allocation schemes that explore the impacts of space prioritisation and development allocation the proposed model provides a comprehensive and reasonable framework for multi functional spatial planning the bn model can be used in combination with other methods such as particle swarm optimisation pso and ga models the optimal allocation of space in different regions can be adjusted by policy agents and human agents the scheme parameter settings can also be adjusted according to regional plans and development strategies in addition the model can be adapted to various spatial optimisation decision making behaviours for target groups and can thereby be used to improve spatial multi functional area identification and planning 6 conclusions we proposed a novel regional scale spatial optimisation framework that can maximise ples at the city level in terms of quantity space and time the optimisation results show that our msabom can improve ples land utilisation rates 22 notably we established a machine learning method based on mas to simulate stakeholder participation and inform the resolution of conflicts of interest in land use behaviour the jta based reasoning algorithm in the bn model was embedded in the mas decision making process as the core area of the tumen river region the yanbian korean autonomous prefecture in china was used as a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach our space optimisation model sought to safeguard the intensive use of production space favourable living space and green and safe ecological space a total of 21 102 samples were captured as ples evaluation indicators this method is more efficient and accurate than traditional methods such as field surveys to bring the simulated optimal allocation results more in line with actual trends the small scale land use preferences of stakeholders were integrated into the optimisation process specifically the bn based jta was integrated into the model to express the dynamic and non linear characteristics of agent behaviour rules so that the preferences of land users and land regulators could be learned a comparative analysis showed that the optimal space allocation solution derived from the model is in line with the trends of on going spatial development additionally the spatial development coefficient and human agency factors were weighted to reflect the dominant drivers of regional development our results show that under the optimal solution land space classified as key optimal general and prohibited development areas accounted for 520 1 280 5 136 and 38 636 km2 respectively for yanbian at the present time the optimal modelled solution ranks development priorities in the order of production ecological and living spaces the optimisation of land use allocation is a complex process that inherently involves multi agent decision making processes to achieve this our proposed approach effectively accounts for the multi dimensional characteristics of optimal allocation in terms of quantity space and time because of the conflicting spatial interests of the subjects involved the application of mas to support more efficient and realistic methods of spatial planning will become increasingly necessary wu et al 2013 in future research we aim to further explore the optimal allocation of land space by focussing on the relationships between trace elements in the spatial units of land use at fine to coarse temporal and spatial scales a multi objective pareto optimisation strategy was applied to msabom to systematically explore the multi dimensional impacts of agent spatial heterogeneity on spatial and socioeconomic patterns of land use across time and space funding this work was supported by the

24730,the study of production living ecological space ples is essential for the sustainable use of land resources and regional socioeconomic development and several studies have adopted ples based evaluation indices however few studies have investigated the effects of governmental regulation and human activity on the optimal allocation of land for different uses crucially the non optimal use of land by urban decision makers leads to multiple problems including wasting potential land resources and trade offs between economic development and environmental protection therefore in this study we developed a multi spatial agent based optimisation model msabom coupled with a multi agent system mas within a machine learning framework the msabom determines spatially optimised land use solutions based on the small scale land use preferences of stakeholders and addresses conflicts in the sub optimal allocation of resources based on the behaviours of model agents and the decision making environment the yanbian korean autonomous prefecture in china was used as a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach the results show that 1 the msabom can significantly improve the optimisation of ples improving the land utilisation rate by 1 22 times 2 based on an understanding of existing practices the optimal allocation plan obtained by the agent based model is more suitable than that obtained by a non agent based model 3 multi functional land use patterns can be optimally allocated in space and time which is extremely useful for coordinating stakeholder participation and addressing conflicts of interest in land use behaviours and 4 an urban spatial development coefficient was successfully used to determine the dominant function and functional positioning of ples which helps ensure flexible development strategies for spatial planning keywords land use optimisation production living ecological space spatial decision making support multi agent system geographic information system 1 introduction the optimisation of land use is crucial for sustainable regional development and environmental protection gao et al 2010 kim et al 2009 scarborough et al 2012 sommer et al 2015 however globally rapid industrialisation and urbanisation have caused a series of social and environmental issues including the wasteful use of resources and ecological degradation with the continuous expansion of urban and rural construction land conflicts between urban agricultural and ecological spaces have become increasingly prominent especially in developing countries such as china thorne et al 2013 wang et al 2018 ye et al 2017 urbanisation in developed western countries shows that when the level of urbanisation reaches 50 problems including uncoordinated urban and rural development uneven regional development and conflicts between economic development and ecological protection therefore spatial planning has emerged as an essential tool for promoting sustainable development cai et al 2014 at the end of 2018 59 6 of china s land was urbanised and the country entered a period of steady urbanisation wang et al 2018 therefore a shift in spatial planning is needed towards a model based on the harmonious coexistence of humans and nature thus limited space resources must be rationally allocated while still promoting regional sustainable development and this has become a major scientific challenge duh and daniel 2007 liu and liu 2014 liu et al 2012b wang and zhu 2015 ples is the products of the synergistic coupling of natural systems and socioeconomic systems huang et al 2017 in 2010 china s national land functional zone plan categorised dominant functional zones according to the type and nature of their development and established a basic framework for land development at the third plenary session of the 18th central committee of the communist party of china xi jinping further proposed that a spatial planning system should be established to limit unrestricted development and promote the careful management of ples in 2017 china s national land planning outline was released and specific arrangements were made for the development of different regions functional areas and development goals huang et al 2017a 2017b liu et al 2017 ye et al 2017 effectively delineating ples especially for the conversion of ecological agricultural and urban space use at the city level is an effective means of optimising land use and achieving a sustainable society at the regional scale huang et al 2017 jiang et al 2013 qi and he 2015 ye et al 2017 currently ples research focusses on defining concepts identifying functional spaces constructing evaluation indices developing optimisation methods and considering the wider implications of the concept and the ples framework huang et al 2017 for example the spatial temporal pattern of ples in china between 1990 and 2010 was studied by liu et al 2017 and a urban rural land ecological production living carrying capacity index and accounting model have since been developed fang et al 2017 selected indicators were identified to build an evaluation index and analyse the coupling and coordination of rural ples functions in chongqing wang and tang 2018 in 2015 an evaluation index and evaluation model were developed for the optimisation of ples and the overall quality of the ples in 289 prefectures and cities was analysed accounting for their different characteristics and spatial distributions liu and shun 2020 nevertheless ples based land use optimisation research is still developing especially at the city level in particular there is a lack of in depth research on the potential benefits of coupling urbanisation and eco environmental theory as the foundation for land use optimisation within the ples framework recently research has been conducted to better understand land use optimisation including top down and bottom up land use optimisation models bennett et al 2004 liu et al 2012a xiao 2008 top down models focus on global optimisation goals consider the overall situation of the area of interest and mathematically assign different land use types to different land parcel units to generate a series of optimal solutions leung and wang 2001 these models usually combine certain optimisation methods with multi objective optimisation techniques to establish an optimal allocation model of land use aerts et al 2003 for example a structural land use optimisation model was established by xin and xiaodong 2017 to promote the effectiveness of land use planning in china furthermore machine learning frameworks have been used to establish spatial optimisation rules for landscape patterns to optimise the spatial arrangement of agricultural landscapes wang 2009 a spatial optimisation model of land use for the yellow river delta nature reserve was constructed by gong et al 2017 from which three target driven schemes were designed to balance ecological protection and economic development however these models do not consider the impacts of human activity on the ecological environment some human activities can lead to a decrease in ecosystem services which directly threatens the ecological foundation of sustainable human development brown et al 2005 thus the msabom is effective for formulating appropriate policies and implementing effective control measures to maximise ples and help balance socioeconomic development whilst minimising environmental damage bottom up models mainly simulate the decision making process and small scale changes in land use li and yeh 2005 for example genetic algorithm ga and cellular automata ca models have been combined with geographical information systems giss grimm et al 2006 to establish urban spatial pattern optimisation models he et al 2006 stewart et al 2004 wang et al 2004 zhang et al 2016 developed a multi objective land use optimisation allocation model based on a multi agent system mas and a loosely coupled model based on gas and game theory was constructed by liu et al 2015 that utilises multi stakeholder games and knowledge of land use planning to address local scale land use competition however the evaluation of the dynamic effects and adjustments of allocation schemes for continuous timeframes is particularly difficult these various models have made significant contributions to the study of spatial land use optimisation however they have certain limitations therefore it is of great importance to establish a spatial optimisation model that accounts for human activity within ples and which is flexible enough to address the land use allocation needs of complex areas generally both top down and bottom up models have intrinsic limitations impeding the optimum land use allocation santé riveira et al 2008 therefore it is necessary to combine both models to overcome their respective defects and obtain reasonable optimization results here we use a bayesian network bn top down model and a mas as the bottom top model in gis science bn modelling is a supervised machine learning method and is an effective way to integrate fuzzy prior knowledge frayer et al 2014 lüscher et al 2009 marcot et al 2006 pollino et al 2007 bns can integrate dynamic land changes i e prior knowledge and the factors that affect the status quo i e observed data combining structured learning with parameter learning plays an important role in assessing the probability that complex factors and events will occur as an excellent bn inference algorithm the junction tree algorithm jta transforms a directed graph into a tree reduces computational requirements and improves the accuracy of models braun and möller 2016 jin et al 2018 ou et al 2019 paskin 2003 as a route to sustainable development this approach can quickly and effectively improve the dynamic self adjustment potential of land use models and identify pathways for optimal space and land use transitions madsen and jensen 1999 namasivayam et al 2006 furthermore mas is an effective method for simulating multi level land use allocation and it is often used to solve complex spatial pattern optimisation allocation problems chen et al 2010 yeh 2006 currently ecological economic models mainly focus on the balance between homogeneous economic agents and heterogeneous interacting economic agents and their associated trade offs akopov et al 2016 filatova et al 2009 grimm et al 2006 for example agent based urban land markets are one factor driving changes in urban land use filatova et al 2009 the heterogeneity introduced in agent based models abms the representation of the land market process and the ability to measure the outputs of a large number of models can significantly enhance the understanding of urban land use change huang et al 2014 grimm et al 2006 proposed an overview design concepts and detailed odd information including the purpose state variables scale and seven other elements as a standard protocol for individual and agent based models this study is based on homogeneous economic entities i e human agents and heterogeneous agents i e government regulators with their own economic goals land use policy is used to restrict and regulate members of society during the development use governance protection and management of land resources within a country or region belsare and gompper 2015 bert et al 2015 frederik et al 2016 many stakeholders often make land use decisions in dynamic geographical environments in fact there may be a complex relationship between agent behaviour and decision making environments therefore in this study we sought to couple a mas approach with adaptive learning capabilities to address ples optimisation problems in which agent behaviours are learned and the emerging conflicts of interest between human activity and the land use policy can be better coordinated this study aims to construct a new model that simulates ples for land use optimisation at the city level based on city scale ples division theory methodological research and a quality evaluation framework the points of interest poi from the amap services are used to identify ples a jta based bn and mas are coupled to learn governmental decisions and human behavioural preferences and thereby simulate ples for land use optimisation dynamic land use changes and ecological suitability data are applied to explore the impacts of urbanisation and ecological environments on ples optimisation moreover we explore the trade offs between production space and living space and the combination of ecological space quantities and spatial land use layouts we also discuss the opportunities for urban spatial pattern development plans our findings help further establish the framework and motivations for developing a production living ecological functional space and provide a basis for optimising urban development 2 materials 2 1 study area the united nations development programme launched the development of the tumen river regional initiative in 1995 this is an important initiative by the northeast asian government which is in intergovernmental cooperation with the transportation energy tourism investment and environmental industries since the tumen river regional cooperation plan proposed the yanbian korean autonomous prefecture as the gateway and frontier of the tumen river regional cooperation area has become the most well connected zone between china and central asian countries cotton 1996 the region is also one of the most important ecologically functional areas in china jin and yujin 2001 yanbian is an offshore frontier that covers an area of 433 000 km2 and faces the sea of japan located in the eastern jilin province of china fig 1 and on the border with russia and korea yanbian has certain geographical advantages that have allowed the development of an export oriented economy yanbian is a key national ecological barrier area and an important hub for land sea transport to europe north america and asia chen et al 2009 colin 2003 yanbian has seven ports that face north korea and one facing russia and therefore provides an important gateway for the national one belt and one road strategy debin and yahua 2015 additionally the region is an important area for wildlife and has several zones containing the highest levels of temperate zone biodiversity in the northern hemisphere the national park for amur tigers and leopards supports the largest population of siberian manchurian tigers and amur leopards in china in the prefecture and is the most important habitat and breeding area for these species feng et al 2017 more than 70 of the park lies within the study area therefore to develop and open up the tumen river area developmental conflicts between the border economy and ecological protection must be resolved which necessarily requires an effort to determine the limits of urban growth 2 2 data sources we extracted poi data a total of 21 102 points from the amap service in 2019 a range of data was obtained for each poi including administrative details and ples categories table 1 we focussed on the following three dimensions to evaluate the quality of urban ples and form a theoretical framework i production spaces as a function of intensive input and efficient output ii living spaces that are comfortable convenient safe and healthy and iii ecological green spaces production spaces e g production transportation and commerce of material products for human beings were directly obtained as a working object and also included social production to incorporate the benefits of various products and service functions including productive services and transportation spaces qi and he 2015 living spaces e g residential areas retail areas and science education and cultural areas which include domestic service industry spaces refer to the land that carries various materials and spiritual functions that are provided by the land during the developmental process wang 2011 ecological spaces also provide ecosystem services to human beings including public garden spaces and scenic spots leng et al 2004 digital elevation models dem were obtained from the geospatial data cloud service http www gscloud cn data relating to water conservation eco environmental sensitivity ecosystem services and soil erosion were obtained from different local government departments land use cover maps 30 m spatial resolution for 2009 and 2017 were provided by tsinghua university http data ess tsinghua edu cn these datasets were rasterised into 1500 1500 m cells the target year for space optimisation in the study region was selected as 2035 3 modelling methods the msabom coordinates the quantity and spatial patterns of ecological and human activities for the decision making process by understanding the driving forces of regional spatial changes to maximise ples additionally the model can evaluate the dynamic effects of allocation schemes and integrate multi agents and bns to optimise spatial patterns in terms of quantity and structure and promote sustainable goals for ecological and urban development 3 1 model variables two dimensional grids of m n spatial units were created to allocate k types of spatial pattern definitions 3 2 objective functions the msabom aims to address the spatial distribution goals and constraints by reallocating decision variable values the decision maker controls the developmental coefficients to determine a region s predominant expected space development trend based on eq 1 for example in this study we selected six different spatial development models to determine whether the expected development in the study area could be considered a production space led development or an ecological space led development see section 3 3 we evaluated the intensive degree of ples using eqs 2 to 4 the weighted sum method was then used to combine these three functions into a composite function the objective function for optimising ples is as follows 1 m a x f w 1 s p w 2 s l w 3 s e 2 s p i 1 m j 1 n k 1 3 q p i j k p p i j k 3 s l i 1 m j 1 n k 1 4 q l i j k p l i j k 4 s e i 1 m j 1 n k 1 2 q e i j k p e i j k where w1 w2 and w3 are the developmental coefficients of the production space living space and ecological space respectively and are determined by the city spatial planner the range of w1 w2 and w3 was 0 1 which satisfies w1 w2 w3 1 qpij k qlij k and qeij k are the kernel density values for the spatial type j in the grid i j and ppij k plij k and peij k represent the probabilities of conversion to the spatial type j in the grid i j 3 3 constraint conditions 3 3 1 spatial patterns to prevent the excessive growth of urban land e g transportation and industrial land occupation of natural ecological space and reductions in ecological quality rules were formulated to ensure the orderly growth of urban land and prevent the development of unrestricted urban sprawl as part of this the edge evaluation state evs was introduced to determine whether an existing space unit is included in the optimisation by identifying whether an adjacent unit contains an ecological policy restriction see section 3 4 1 for details as follows 5 evs 1 i f s t i j c 0 i f s t i j c where 6 s t i j i j s i j 7 c n 2 here stij is the total number of units containing ecological policy restrictions around the unit i j and n is the number of spatial units neighbouring unit i j when evs 1 the space unit will fill the construction land outward along the original boundary when evs 0 there is a high probability that the space will occupy the protected ecological space and the simulation is stopped 3 3 2 forest cover approximately 80 8 of the study area consists of forest therefore according to the chinese forest protection policy that prohibits logging the forest cover constraint given below was used in the model to ensure that areas with forest cover made up the largest proportion of land use types 8 s e f s e k where sef is the area of forested land at the end of the planning period and sek is the area of land use type k at the end of the planning period 3 3 3 land use quantity and structure the total area of all land use types in the study area was limited to a planned target using land use quantity and structure constraints for example the area of regional ecological land had to be greater than the area of protected ecological land therefore the area of newly developed urban land had to remain below the upper limit of urban expansion expressed as follows 9 m i n o s o m a x o where so is the total area of all land use types in the study area and min o and max o are the upper and lower limits respectively of a specific land use type 3 3 4 region regional constraints included a total area constraint which referred to the total learning area of the grid and could not be changed and an administrative boundary integrity constraint that excluded land use types located outside the study area from the calculations 3 3 5 population the population constraint specified that the size of the regional population must not exceed the expected population size of the study area expressed as below 10 d 1 s u d 2 s f p where d1 is the average population density of urban land d2 is the average population density of agricultural land su is the area of urban land sf is the area of agricultural land and p is the expected population size of the study area 3 3 6 market economy market economy constraints were used to account for local government requirements for land use planning specifically at the end of the planning period the areas of urban industrial mining and transportation land must have increased and the area of unused land must have decreased gradually as follows 11 s s k s s l where k represents the land use type i e urban industrial mining or transportation land ssk is area of a specific land use type at the end of the planning period and ssl is the area of a specific land use type at the beginning of the planning period the following condition also had to be met 12 s e k s e l where sek is the unused land area at the end of the planning period and sel is the unused land area at the beginning of the period 3 4 multi agent decision making rules governments and human beings were the two main stakeholders and both have significant impacts on the spatial allocation of urban resources governmental departments formulate macro land use policies and ecological protection strategies including the protected ecological land to control the unlimited development of urban spaces bai et al 2016 bai et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 as a competitor for urban space human beings use land resources as production and living spaces which in turn affects ecological patterns here two types of agents were designed to simulate stakeholder participation and decision making behaviours in urban space allocation namely policy agents agentp and human agents agenth 3 4 1 agentp decision making rules each governmental planning department has an impact on land use through resource management and space development regulations in china the ministry of natural resources being responsible for the management of various types of land resources is the decision maker for land use planning other departments including the ministry of ecology and environment and the ministry of agriculture are responsible for formulating regulations or sub regulations for different space resources regulations made by these departments can encourage restrict or prohibit human construction activities the decision making process and subsequent behaviours of policy agents are affected both by ecological suitability and land dynamic changes li et al 2018 wang and jiang 2014 ecological suitability factors reflect wide ranging ecological land use conditions including natural conditions land quality and location factors that are important for ecological protection the natural conditions included in the model included gradient topography dem relief amplitude water conservation and the distance to a nature reserve and waterbody land quality factors included eco environmental sensitivity the importance of ecosystem services and the degree of soil erosion and location factors included the distance to a railway township or road and reflect the impacts that construction and transportation have on ecologically important land therefore a defined policy agent can be expressed as follows 13 a g e n t p a g p p 1 p i k 0 5 2 p i k 0 5 where agpp represents the governmental control actions of the ith cell in space k where 1 indicates the government prohibits any construction actions and 2 indicates that the government encourages construction and pik indicates the probability between 0 and 1 of forbidden construction in the ith cell of space k pik values were assigned based on the resource management and control policies of different departments a bn was used to learn the experience of experts and government policymakers to determine the probability of space control the policy agents accounted for the ecological redline strategy implemented by the ministry of ecology and environment and the urban space control plans implemented by the ministry of natural resources fig 2 also see eq 15 in section 3 5 3 4 2 agenth decision making rules a broad range of human agents including experienced experts and land users have an important influence on production living and ecological spaces primarily motivated by a desire to survive develop and improve living standards experts provide rich theoretical knowledge to determine the space quota coefficient for land user behaviour land users reflect the small scale processes of participatory land use which was accounted for in the mode by searching for various types of land use in the city including parkland and residential productive and domestic service industries the production spaces were jointly determined by agents with insurance finance transportation facilities and corporate attributes ecological spaces were determined by agents using the attributes of public gardens and scenic spots and living spaces were determined by agents using the attributes of residential and retail services and science education and culture services using this approach for urban spatial patterns as controlled by agpp the space quota for each human activity was determined using eq 14 and the influence of each sub factor was determined using an analytic hierarchy process ahp as follows 14 a g e n t h a g h s s 1 s c s w s where cs is the density of each of the factors ws is the weighting of each factor s and aghs is the intensity of human activity in cell space s 3 5 jta based bn with agent based optimisation bayesian network models are different from other optimisation algorithms as they can express the conditional dependence between factor variables as a function of topology in combination with the conditional probability of the factor giving a joint probability for all factor nodes dong et al 2012 tsamardinos et al 2006 additionally bns can combine qualitative and quantitative analyses by combining prior knowledge with sample data and integrating policy controls and expert experience our jta based bn model learned the behavioural rules of the agents and derived the optimal spatial solution for urban human activity as fig 3 shows the jta framework for reasoning in the bn model with the multi agent optimisation system consists of the three following steps step 1 discretisation consists of discrete event variables discrete criteria and a range of values according to the nature break method in arcgis software step 2 training and learning experience uses the agent based method to train and learn the rules of the control and human activity spaces in an area and obtains the joint probability distribution of multi target agents as expressed by eq 15 15 p x j x n j 1 n p x j p a r e n t s x j where p xj parents xj represents the conditional probability table of node xj finally step 3 message spread involves the jta based transform of the bn into an undirected tree and allows the message to complete the transmission process on the undirected tree which infers the probability distribution of random variables in the bn creating a junction tree jt requires moralisation and triangulation paskin 2003 the main purpose of the jta is to transform the bn into a second structure ss and obtain the exact results of the bn reasoning by inferring ss 16 s s j t p p where jt c s is a jt in which c is a clique in the bn s is an edge in the jt and pp is the probability potential with the clique and edge after transformation parameters for all the nodes in the jt must be specified i e the jt must be initialised namasivayam et al 2006 messages can then be transmitted within the jt by transmitting messages via all nodes the jt is globally consistent and the probability distribution of a random variable v can be calculated as follows 17 p v c v ϕ c 18 p v e p v e v p v e where p v is the probability distribution of variable v under clique c and p v e is the probability distribution of v following the inclusion of new evidence e in the jt steps 2 and 3 can be repeated until the required accuracy of the simulation results is reaches the policy agents agenth and human agents agentp identified in eq 13 and eq 14 train and teach the model and function as prior knowledge data the probability of each variable is incorporated into eqs 2 4 to obtain the spatial pattern of ples and the optimal allocation plan of ples is obtained using eq 1 4 results 4 1 model validation we evaluated the accuracy of the model by calculating the area under the curve auc and the receiver operating characteristic sommer et al 2015 this was done by dividing the data into training and test datasets for this we divided the resulting grid network into an average of three groups and 2 000 grids were randomly selected from each as the validation dataset and the remaining grids were used as the training dataset to calculate the auc and roc we set the threshold of 0 6 positive classes with probabilities 0 6 and negative classes with probabilities 0 6 were then obtained a set of corresponding coordinates were calculated as false positive fpr and true positive rates so that the corresponding coordinate points could be obtained in the plane by repeating three rounds of cross validation the auc values were calculated as shown in fig 4 the average accuracy of the model was 88 3 4 2 multi agent instantiation information for each department in the study area was collected to determine the governmental control behaviour of the policy agents this includes the ecological red line demarcation area issued by local governments and the urban space management control plans formulated by the natural resources department urban space management zones reflect three levels i restricted development ii conditional development and iii priority development fig 5b according to the ecological red line plan area 22 524 km2 we simulated the ecological red line spatial control region based on the policy agent decision model fig 5a and implemented this using agentp fig 5c the behaviour rules of the human agents were established through poi data for land user behaviour the spatial distribution of human activity was obtained from the poi kernel density data points the human agent model consisted of 13 factors including policy agent control results that were in line with governmental decisions two factors public gardens and scenic spots determined the ecological space pattern three factors insurance finances transportation facilities and corporate enterprises determined the production space pattern and four factors residential services retail services science education and culture and living services determined the living space pattern thus the spatial distribution of policy agents and human agents in 2035 was obtained using the msabom fig 5 and fig 6 4 3 simulation results six space optimisation allocation schemes which were used by urban planners to provide a reference for the optimal allocation of urban spatial patterns were determined as shown in table 2 and fig 7 s1 was designed as a contrasting treatment scheme and the solution does not include human activities or government control decisions but includes the allocation of influential ples factors considering the synergy between the policy agents and human agents models s2 s6 were designed as experimental processing methods the comparison of s1 and s2 s6 allowed us to assess the impact of policy agents on the optimal allocation of production space living space and ecological space in s2 s6 the combination of behavioural rules with machine learning allowed us to assess the impacts of urban development in instances with different priorities ples development priorities in the experiment the programme predicts six optimal allocation space patterns by training a multi agent model and learning from prior information the results are shown in fig 7 where f was determined according to the objective function defined in eq 1 the simulation results show that the final order of the preferred schemes was 2 4 6 3 5 and 1 fig 8 s1 is an unrealistic situation as it assumes that governmental regulations will not have any impacts on space allocation the results from s3 and s5 are consistent which means that developing living spaces is not the best urban planning strategy for yanbian the results for s4 show that priority is given to the development of ecological spaces the coordinated development of production and living spaces is an alternative scenario that maximises production living and ecological spaces for human activities both s2 and s6 prove that on the premise of giving priority to the development of production spaces the development of ecological spaces is more important than the development of living spaces which is similar to the adopted development plan for the research area this means that governmental decision making and human activities have resulted in similar outcomes to the ples optimisation method based on the policy and the human agents s2 is therefore a suitable solution for optimal space allocation in the study area for the next 20 years 4 4 optimisation performance evaluation by superimposing the land use spatial layout map before and after optimisation we found that optimised ples improved the land utilisation rate by 1 22 times the land use rates of cultivated land and construction land were greatly improved fig 9 the area of all land use types was redistributed through the optimisation model table 3 the area of arable land woodland grassland and construction land in the key development areas increased the area of bare land decreased and the area of water remained unchanged overall the model produced effective optimisation results from improving land use rates and allocating ples as fig 10 shows the spatial layout before and after optimisation was in line with actual trends for example the key developmental area is located in the innermost zone of the city within the suburbs where both population and industry are concentrated the prohibited construction area is in the outermost zone of the city which has the largest forest capacity however the allocation of land use after optimisation was more in line with the optimisation goal for example the optimised allocation area in the key development area was higher before optimisation which indicates that economic development and ecological protection were inconsistent the suitability of living space needs to be improved in the innermost population zone of the city in general for stakeholders non optimal land use wastes ples resources reduces the intensity of land use in the region and results in the inability to coordinate the development of the regional economy ecology and society the optimised land use allocation model is more in line with the actual decision making preferences of land users in other words the small scale land use preferences of stakeholders are well integrated into the optimisation process the optimised ples can guide the development of land by allocating resources in different regions and using land types under the legal supervision of land use related policies our approach represents a space optimisation model including the allocation of space for intensive and efficient production favourable social space and green and safe ecological space 4 5 spatial layout of optimal solutions analysing the distribution of urban spatial patterns in the optimal allocation plan can inform developmental strategies for different counties and cities governmental decisions and human activities were integrated into the optimisation process so that the optimisation results will likely be more widely accepted as the best option solution s2 was reclassified into the following four categories key optimal general and prohibited development areas as shown in fig 11 the overall distribution space pattern for yanbian shows the characteristic of multi core development in the central urban area and each of the optimal areas is explained in detail in the following sections 4 5 1 key development areas these areas are mainly concentrated in urban areas that cover 520 km2 including yanji dunhua longjing tumen and hunchun yanji longjing and tumen are contiguously clustered and the development zones are encouraged key and optimal development areas from yanji towards longjing and tumen consisting of 14 1 of the total area in the yanji longjing tumen region this is in line with the yanji longjing tumen integration strategy dunhua is one of the node cities for the changchun jilin tumen development and opening pilot zone due to its superior transportation and rich commercial and trading resources dunhua has become the second largest development area in yanbian as the gateway to the tumen river region the hunchun border economic cooperation zone will gradually become more competitive for industry including multi border cooperative industrial parks international logistics and multinational tourism these areas will have a solid economic foundation strong carrying capacity for resources and the environment and significant developmental potential that focusses on production living and ecological development 4 5 2 optimal development areas the optimal development areas cover 1 280 km2 and are located mainly in the suburbs of the yanji longjing area dunhua and wangqing as the size of each city expands the number of construction sites and overall investment increases and production and living space gradually become more developed it is noteworthy that the changbai mountain scenic spot in southwest yanbian also has a strong driving effect on external cities it is therefore necessary to consider the coordinated development of ecological protection and production spaces while developing the tourism industry 4 5 3 general development areas general development areas are mainly located in the outermost zone of each city and cover 5 136 km2 in these partitions the capacity of agricultural land is high to protect agricultural land it is necessary to improve agricultural development in the suburbs in terms of efficiency ecology and safety moreover it is necessary to focus on the development of green organic agricultural products strengthen land remediation and promote the centralised and continuous use of farmland which improves land resource utilisation efficiency and labour productivity by using modern technology the development of living spaces and production spaces should also be coordinated and matched with the development of ecological spaces and agricultural production 4 5 4 prohibited development areas prohibited development areas cover 38 636 km2 or 87 4 of the total land area and consist of all types of natural and cultural resource protection zones these were established at various levels and other critical ecological function zones requiring special protection were prohibited from industrial and urban development these mainly include the hunchun siberian tiger national nature reserve the changbai mountain national nature reserve the tianfozhishan national nature reserve and the zhenfengling national nature protected area as well as other nature reserves water reserves and government prohibited development areas 5 discussion spatial optimisation is a complex spatial and socioeconomic decision making process arika 2017 our proposed msabom solves two challenging issues related to the conflicts of interest between governmental land use regulations and human activity preferences furthermore linking human activity preferences to land space remains a challenge li et al 2016 using functions to simulate these complex behaviours in a way that accounts for the rational planning of ples based on sectoral regulations and regional natural social and economic conditions is difficult however this can be achieved by using machine learning methods to train and learn realistic decision making as a set of quantitative rules in a bn model this mechanism guides the process of optimal space allocation through behaviour preference rules and promotes human activities for participation in urban space planning additionally the spatial pattern of human activities based on poi can be used in mass to more accurately identify regional productive living and spatially dominated functional patterns that provide ecological products and services ye et al 2011 thus machine learning provides an effective method for empirical learning when based on multiple samples used for training and simulation our experiments show that accounting for human activities is crucial for the spatial planning of multi functional areas which in turn affects patterns of ples and ultimately sustainable development the mas approach combines governmental decision making behaviours with human activities which have proved to be a particularly challenging issue shi et al 2006 establishing a governmental decision making policy agent and a human agent that embodies human preferences can help capture the rational land use behaviour of land users in line with corresponding regulations in china regulations and environmental protection policies are formulated by the government s ministry of natural resources and ministry of environment and ecological protection which were used as regulatory conditions in the multi agent model additionally the jta based algorithm utilises bn reasoning for governmental department decision learning and expresses land use restrictions for each land unit as probability values this approach can determine whether each land block is forbidden by the jta or whether development is encouraged as one of the input variables for the bn the e cological suitability factor allows the model to ensure that land use activities abide by the relevant policies and retains maximum ecological service value li et al 2018 for human agents the experience of nine experts was used as a weighting factor in eq 14 and a spatial pattern that balances each type of human activity function was used to derive prior probability factors for the model in this way the ples in the research area was simulated by adjusting the relative spatial importance values schemes 1 to 6 represent different space optimisation allocation schemes that explore the impacts of space prioritisation and development allocation the proposed model provides a comprehensive and reasonable framework for multi functional spatial planning the bn model can be used in combination with other methods such as particle swarm optimisation pso and ga models the optimal allocation of space in different regions can be adjusted by policy agents and human agents the scheme parameter settings can also be adjusted according to regional plans and development strategies in addition the model can be adapted to various spatial optimisation decision making behaviours for target groups and can thereby be used to improve spatial multi functional area identification and planning 6 conclusions we proposed a novel regional scale spatial optimisation framework that can maximise ples at the city level in terms of quantity space and time the optimisation results show that our msabom can improve ples land utilisation rates 22 notably we established a machine learning method based on mas to simulate stakeholder participation and inform the resolution of conflicts of interest in land use behaviour the jta based reasoning algorithm in the bn model was embedded in the mas decision making process as the core area of the tumen river region the yanbian korean autonomous prefecture in china was used as a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach our space optimisation model sought to safeguard the intensive use of production space favourable living space and green and safe ecological space a total of 21 102 samples were captured as ples evaluation indicators this method is more efficient and accurate than traditional methods such as field surveys to bring the simulated optimal allocation results more in line with actual trends the small scale land use preferences of stakeholders were integrated into the optimisation process specifically the bn based jta was integrated into the model to express the dynamic and non linear characteristics of agent behaviour rules so that the preferences of land users and land regulators could be learned a comparative analysis showed that the optimal space allocation solution derived from the model is in line with the trends of on going spatial development additionally the spatial development coefficient and human agency factors were weighted to reflect the dominant drivers of regional development our results show that under the optimal solution land space classified as key optimal general and prohibited development areas accounted for 520 1 280 5 136 and 38 636 km2 respectively for yanbian at the present time the optimal modelled solution ranks development priorities in the order of production ecological and living spaces the optimisation of land use allocation is a complex process that inherently involves multi agent decision making processes to achieve this our proposed approach effectively accounts for the multi dimensional characteristics of optimal allocation in terms of quantity space and time because of the conflicting spatial interests of the subjects involved the application of mas to support more efficient and realistic methods of spatial planning will become increasingly necessary wu et al 2013 in future research we aim to further explore the optimal allocation of land space by focussing on the relationships between trace elements in the spatial units of land use at fine to coarse temporal and spatial scales a multi objective pareto optimisation strategy was applied to msabom to systematically explore the multi dimensional impacts of agent spatial heterogeneity on spatial and socioeconomic patterns of land use across time and space funding this work was supported by the

24731,integrated multi trophic aquaculture imta systems have been designed to optimize nutrient and energy use to decrease waste and to diversify fish farm production recently the development of detritivorous aquaculture has been encouraged as detrivores can consume organic particulate matter reducing benthic eutrophication and the environmental footprint of aquaculture to this end the polychaete hediste diversicolor is a promising species due to its broad feeding behaviour and its resistance in a wide range of environments in this study an existing dynamic energy budget deb model of h diversicolor was used to predict the ragworm s metabolic processes in various environmental conditions and to estimate its bioremediation capacity in an aquaculture context first the scaled functional response f was calibrated in a 98 day growth experiment with two types of food fish faeces and fish feed then we further validated the model using data on the ammonia excretion and oxygen consumption of individuals fed with fish faeces at four different temperatures using the previously calibrated f overall we found that the deb model was able to correctly predict the experimental data 0 51 mre 0 80 lastly different environmental scenarios of seawater temperatures and assimilation rates were compared the bioremediation potential of h diversicolor was estimated based on cumulated assimilation rates which could represent 75 289 kg of fish waste year 1 for a 100 m2 ragworm farm 3700 ind m 2 these findings suggest that the deb model is a promising tool for further imta development and management keywords deb deposit feeders fish waste metabolism ragworm semelparous bioenergetics 1 introduction fed aquaculture can impact ecosystems through the release of organic matter and dissolved nutrients hargrave 2005 one way to minimize aquaculture waste is to develop integrated multi trophic aquaculture imta in which organisms of different trophic levels are co cultured on the same farm chopin et al 2012 this type of aquaculture can include fed species e g finfish or shrimp as well as extractive species such as algae that can feed on dissolved inorganic waste generated by the fed species abreu et al 2011 erler et al 2000 or filter feeders and detritivores that can feed on generated organic waste jiang et al 2013 neori et al 2004 in open water particulate organic matter fluxes faeces and uneaten feed are mainly vertical filgueira et al 2017 and may accumulate on the bottom sediment both within the farm site and close to it inducing benthic eutrophication hargrave 2005 the quantity and biochemical composition of the nutrients and organic matter released depends on the cultured species the farm size the feed composition and the rearing conditions brigolin et al 2010 using detritivore species in imta may improve the mineralization of organic matter through bioturbation processes hedman et al 2011 and feeding cammen 1980 thus preventing benthic eutrophication the bioremediation potential of several detritivorous species has been evaluated including fish katz et al 2002 porter et al 1996 sea cucumbers cubillo et al 2016 macdonald et al 2013 nelson et al 2012 paltzat et al 2008 chary et al 2020 sea urchins cook and kelly 2007 orr et al 2014 and polychaetes fang et al 2017 marques et al 2017 among polychaetes hediste nereis diversicolor o f müller 1776 has been widely studied gillet et al 2008 mermillod blondin et al 2004 similar to other nereididae this species plays an important ecological role by constructing burrows in sediment to create galleries their bioturbation and ventilation activities promote nutrient fluxes between water and sediment favouring the oxygenation of the sediment michaud et al 2006 and enhancing organic matter mineralization and nutrient recycling heilskov and holmer 2001 additionally h diversicolor can cope with a large range of environmental conditions in terms of variation in organic matter loading temperature and salinity kristensen 1983 ozoh and jones 1990 moreover its feeding behaviour is diversified it is considered a detritivore carnivore herbivore suspension feeder and even an optional filter feeder nielsen et al 1995 riisgård 1994 more recently the biomitigation activity of this species has been explored cubillo et al 2016 marques et al 2017 papaspyrou et al 2010 and studies have demonstrated that individuals can grow significantly when fed on fish waste bischoff et al 2009 wang et al 2019 cubillo et al 2016 and marques et al 2017 have also shown that h diversicolor could assimilate particulate organic matter from fish farms confirming its potential for imta however these studies were carried out under specific temperature and salinity conditions making predicting the bioremediation capacity in other environmental conditions difficult in this context mechanistic models can be useful tools as they can simulate physiological and ecological processes under a large range of environmental conditions starting from empirical results in a limited number of environmental conditions this modelling framework allows these results to be extrapolated in order to predict the metabolic responses of individuals in other environmental conditions reid et al 2020 bioenergetic models are based on the fluxes and conservation of energy in physiological processes in which energy available for somatic growth is estimated as a result of feeding and excretion brett and groves 1979 the model chosen in this study was the dynamic energy budget deb model kooijman 2010 which is based on the use of energy by an organism for physiological processes such as food assimilation growth maintenance and reproduction this model has been demonstrated to correctly model the lifecycle of a wide range of species from bacteria to large mammals the framework provided by the deb theory allows the quantification of processes of interest for aquaculture such as growth and feeding efficiency and of increasing interest for imta such as the bioremediation capacity of extractive species reid et al 2020 chary et al 2020 the associated deb parameters for more than 2000 modelled species to date are available on the online platform add my pet amp www bio vu nl thb deb deblab add my pet of these species 7 are polychaetes with the recent additions of arenicola marina de cubber et al 2019 and hediste diversicolor lefebvre 2019 these deb model parameters for h diversicolor can now be used to predict metabolic processes under different environmental conditions the aim of this study was to analyze the mitigation potential of deposit feeding h diversicolor in co cultivation with finfish the objectives were 1 to validate the deb model using new datasets obtained through laboratory experiments on growth rates and ammonia excretion as well as data on oxygen consumption published independently of the calibration procedure 2 to evaluate the effects of seawater temperatures 5 c to 25 c and assimilation rates from ad libitum to half an ad libitum ration on some life history traits of h diversicolor and 3 to quantify the bioremediation potential of h diversicolor in different aquaculture contexts 2 material and methods 2 1 the deb theory and the lifecycle of h diversicolor a general presentation of the deb theory and its mathematical formulation is presented in supplementary material see s1 to perform the deb simulations for h diversicolor we used the available parameters in the amp database lefebvre 2019 table 1 using an abj model essentially the deb theory is based on the assumption that assimilated energy first enters a reserve compartment e a fixed fraction κ of the energy flux coming from the reserve is then utilized first for somatic maintenance costs and the remaining part for growth of the structural volume v the other fraction 1 κ is spent on maturation eh in juveniles or on reproduction er in adults after having paid the maturity maintenance costs figure 1 acquisition processes i e ingestion and assimilation are linked to the organism s surface area while somatic maintenance is proportional to its volume in contrast to the standard version of the deb model std the abj model considers a metabolic acceleration between birth and metamorphosis see s1 consequently we scaled maximum surface specific assimilation p a m and energy conductance v to the organism s structural length between birth and metamorphosis following kooijman et al 2011 finally as it is a semelparous species h diversicolor dies after its first reproduction olive and garwood 1981 therefore the maximum structural length lm was the structural length of the animal that attains first reproduction in deb theory authors refer to this reproductive strategy as suicide reproduction kooijman 2010 the deb model describes changes in the energy content of four state variables e v eh and er for adults which cannot be measured directly the volumetric structural length l v1 3 can be approximated by the shape corrected physical observable length δm lw in this study the length cm of the first three segments l3 the combined length of the prostomium peristomium and the first setiger was used as the physical length as this is more reliable than the total length in polychaetes wet weight ww was calculated as the sum of the wet mass of the structure and the wet mass of the reserve see s1 the wet mass of the reproductive buffer was not included in the ww calculation because it was considered negligible most of the time gsi 3 see below 2 2 h diversicolor growth performance in controlled environments 2 2 1 sampling h diversicolor individuals were collected in the wild in arnel lagoon on the french mediterranean coast the experiments were conducted in the ifremer marine aquaculture experimental station palavas les flots france for the oxygen and excretion experiments individuals were acclimatized for 10 days see details below for the growth experiment in vitro reproduction was carried out in october 2016 in order to begin with individuals of the same age during the early larvae stage from 0 to 22 days the polychaete offspring were fed with microalgae chlorella sp which were cultured at the experimental station and can be ingested this was confirmed by microscopic observation of the gut content before the beginning of the growth experiment juveniles from 22 to 113 days were fed with fish faeces and raised at temperatures ranging between 15 c and 18 c this food was chosen because fish farm waste is mainly composed of fish faeces and a varying proportion of uneaten fish feed galasso et al 2017 2 2 2 growth rates the growth experiment was conducted on individuals when they reached 113 days of age the experiment lasted 98 days february april 2017 two types of feed were tested faeces from farmed european seabass dicentrarchus labrax fish faeces and commercial fish feed fish feed the collection and preparation of these are detailed in galasso et al 2017 the fish faeces were composed of 72 organic matter om including 3 total organic nitrogen ton and 7 total lipids tl and 28 ash the commercial fish feed was composed of 87 om including 7 ton and 12 tl and 12 ash polychaetes were fed ad libitum based on the observation of leftover food in the tank from 48 mg feed ind 1 d 1 to 85 mg ind 1 d 1 from the beginning to the end of the experiment the 113 1 day old individuals days post fertilization at the start of the growth experiment measured on average 1 16 0 24 mm l3 each treatment was performed in small tanks 4 l in triplicate 6 tanks 18 polychaetes per tank total of 108 worms the water temperature was maintained at 17 1 c and at a salinity of 18 1 psu temperature and salinity conditions favourable to hediste growth olivier et al 1996 batista et al 2003 the worms were reared without sediment but plastic tubes ø 4 mm several lengths were added to provide refuge to reduce stress adapted from nesto et al 2018 the tanks were continuously aerated to maintain oxygen concentration close to saturation for the given temperature galasso et al 2018 individual wet weight was measured on days 177 and 211 and individual l3 length on days 113 144 177 and 211 the worms were weighed individually after a fasting period of 24 h to empty their digestive tract they were then carefully taken from the water using a dip net cleaned with seawater and dried on paper towels before being weighed on an analytical balance with a precision of 0 001 g specific growth rate was calculated as s g r log w w f log w w i t f 100 where wwi and wwf is the wet weight g at the beginning and the end of the experiment respectively and t is the experiment duration d hopkins 1992 a two way anova was performed to test the effect of food type fixed factor n 2 fish feed and fish faeces and tank random factor n 3 on ww and l3 at each biometry data in total 54 individuals were measured per food type 2 2 3 oxygen consumption the oxygen consumption rates of the ragworms were recorded as a proxy of the minimal metabolic rate the standard metabolic rate at four temperatures 11 c 17 c 22 c and 27 c the oxygen consumption could be considered a proxy of the minimal metabolic rate as it was measured on individuals that had fasted for 24 h in the dark a detailed description of the experiments and results are presented in galasso et al 2018 the individuals ranged from 0 02 to 0 57 g ww and 1 40 to 3 64 mm l3 the polychaetes were acclimatized for 10 days and fed ad libitum with seabass dicentrarchus labrax faeces then acclimatized for 7 days at the experimental temperature conditions the incubation times were chosen to prevent oxygen saturation from dropping below 80 consequently incubation times varied from 4 h for the aquariums at 22 c and 27 c to 5 h for those at 11 c and 17 c the results were expressed in µmol h 2 2 4 ammonia excretion an ammonia excretion experiment was performed simultaneously with oxygen consumption measurements water samples 50 ml were taken at the beginning of the experiment t 0 filtered seawater was used to fill the individual chambers and at the end of incubation tf and immediately frozen at 20 c for further ammonium analyses n nh4 the ammonium concentrations were measured using seal aa3 analytical autoanalyser standard methods aminot and kérouel 2007 with fluorometric detection from jasco fp 2020plus france ammonia excretion rates were determined following the equation used by galasso et al 2018 for oxygen n nh4 was transformed to n nh3 using the conversion factor 1 22 based on molar mass 2 3 comparison between predicted and observed data simulations were then carried out to compare the output of the model to data from laboratory experiments on growth performance oxygen consumption j o and ammonia excretion j n in deb theory j o and j n are weighted sums of three basic fluxes assimilation p a dissipation p d and growth p g see s1 for details and equations first optimizations of scaled functional response f were performed to evaluate the assimilation rate of the polychaetes this was performed using the cma es function from the cmaes package in r trautmann et al 2011 run to minimize the mean relative error mre between predicted and observed data first an f value was obtained for the period prior to the growth experiment until 113 days of age and then an f value was fitted for each feeding condition fish faeces or fish feed in the growth experiment the last l3 length was not used in the fitting process because of high size specific mortality related to reproduction as individuals become green at maturity dales 1950 we used this criteria to remove these individuals from the group and from the dataset water temperatures during the different experiments were included in the model second since the oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion experiment was performed using individuals fed on faeces the f fitted using the growth experiment on individuals fed faeces was used for simulating these variables in addition as the polychaetes used in the respiration and excretion experiment were collected in the wild the age and life histories of these individuals were unknown the scaling with the length and weight was therefore obtained using the deb model run for individuals with identical life histories but different ages therefore all the observed differences in lengths within this experiment were linked to differences in age finally since the experiment was performed on polychaetes that had been starved for 24 h we assumed that the oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion associated to energy assimilation was null p a 0 2 4 imta scenarios temperature and assimilation rates 2 4 1 effects of temperature and assimilation rate variations we evaluated the effects of two key factors that may affect growth temperature and assimilation rates as temperature is the main factor in metabolism changes especially in ectotherms wieser 1973 the effect of a large range of temperatures from 5 c to 25 c in 5 c increments with fixed optimal feeding conditions scaled functional response f 1 was tested this range was selected based on temperature variations observed in h diversicolor habitats scaps 2002 and temperatures that are recorded in european aquaculture production from norway to mediterranean sea ex brigolin et al 2014 wang et al 2020 assimilation rates were also tested with f ranging from 0 5 to 1 half ration of ad libitum to full ad libitum in 0 1 increments at a constant 20 c temperature the gonadosomatic index gsi is the ratio between gonad mass and total body mass using deb theory gsi is estimated as the ratio between the reproduction buffer wet mass and the wet weight of the animal see s1 the gsi could therefore be estimated for each age in the growth experiment in parallel survival was recorded during the growth experiment it was assumed to be mostly related to the spawning event and the associated death of the animals we posited that spawning was triggered above a certain gsi threshold the survival curve was fitted over time using a sigmoid function with the nls function in r 3 6 2 and rstudio 1 2 5033 this enabled us to create a link between the estimated gsi and survival the curve was fitted with a polynomial curve of degree 5 using the poly function in r in order to obtain links between survival and any gsi only the results from the growth experiment using faeces were used for these estimations since faeces are intended to be the most important food source in a well designed imta system a gsi of 3 was chosen for the bioremediation simulations since survival was high until this threshold 90 2 4 2 bioremediation capacity to estimate the bioremediation capacity of polychaete to consume fish solid wastes total assimilated energy was estimated over a ragworm production cycle from birth to harvest in several scenarios at 20 c with f 0 5 or f 1 and at 5 c and 25 c with f 1 in aquaculture a good compromise between reaching commercial weight and survival rates has to be found for each scenario simulations were either stopped when the gsi reached 3 or when individual reached 0 5 g ww minimum polychaete market size nesto et al 2012 total assimilated energy j was then transformed into grams of dry weight g dw of faeces considering that the energy content of one g dw of fish faeces was 10 4 kj we based our estimation on the average composition of seabass faeces proteins 14 lipids 4 6 carbohydrates 12 8 fibre 40 6 and ash 28 galasso et al 2017 and the associated respective energy contents of 23 6 kj g 1 36 2 kj g 1 17 2 kj g 1 8 kj g 1 and 0 kj g 1 brigolin et al 2014 chary et al 2020 based on information provided in another study scaps 2002 we considered a population density of 3700 ind m 2 and estimated the bioremediation capacity of a ragworm farm per m2 for a year round production considering the life expectancy of the ragworms and the control of h diversicolor reproduction wang et al 2020 3 results and discussion the results from our simulations obtained for h diversicolor using deb theory provided a good fit with new empirical data on growth oxygen consumption and excretion in aquaculture conditions this new empirical data set was not used for the optimization of the parameters available online lefebvre 2019 and therefore we applied it in order to independently validate the parameter set 3 1 growth rates and food quality the effect of the two food types fish faeces and fish feed on the growth rates of hediste diversicolor are presented in table 2 after 98 days of the experiment polychaetes fed with fish faeces had a slightly ns higher final weight 0 41 0 17 g and length l3 0 30 0 05 cm than those fed with fish feed ww 0 36 0 15 g and l3 0 28 0 06 cm significant difference between treatment was only observed on day 177 two way anova test see table 2 individual growth rates from day 113 to 177 were 0 03 mm l3 d 1 and 5 mg ww d 1 3 8 sgr for faeces and 0 02 mm l3 d 1 and 4 2 mg ww d 1 3 5 sgr for feed we used the deb model as an explanatory tool to estimate scaled functional response f levels in our growth experiment f were estimated at 0 6 and 0 5 for fish faeces and fish feed respectively resulting in slightly higher growth rates for h diversicolor feed with fish faeces the deb simulation fit well with observed length data in the growth experiment figure 2 with an mre of 0 11 in results obtained in other studies a high variation in growth rates has been observed in relation to food quality for example in similar conditions of temperature and salinity 25 psu 18 c and for comparable initial weights 50 mg ww lower growth rates 2 1 mg ww d 1 1 8 sgr were measured for h diversicolor fed with macroalgae olivier et al 1996 meziane and retiere 2002 obtained even lower growth rates 0 5 to 2 8 mg ww d 1 0 3 to 1 9 sgr for ragworms fed with halophyte detritus in similar environmental conditions 15 psu 21 c however fidalgo e costa et al 2000 measured growth rates of 14 mg ww d 1 5 5 sgr feeding h diversicolor with a post larval shrimp diet 15 psu and 20 c high growth rates 6 to 12 d 1 sgr were also recorded in nesto et al 2012 who tested three different sources of food including larviva biomar and a seaweed sargassum muticum a low protein food in h diversicolor cultures in fact this last study was used in the parameter estimation procedure for h diversicolor lefebvre 2019 add my pet considering a maximal functional response for the best food source f 1 wang et al 2019 observed that h diversicolor reared on fish feed 0 025 d 1 sgr grew significantly faster than worms grown on the other diets including smolt waste 0 012 d 1 sgr the difference between their growth rates and the rates measured in our study may originate from varying food quality and other different experimental conditions i e presence absence of sediment indeed in our experiment food was provided ad libitum suggesting that f 1 the fitted f values of 0 5 and 0 6 obtained in our study probably result from a lower digestibility of fish waste compared to other food sources see lefebvre et al 2000 further experiments could be performed to investigate these hypotheses nevertheless our results showed that despite differences in food quality growth rates were in the range of other studies more importantly although fish waste does not lead to the best sgr compared to other studies our results indicate that it is a suitable food type for the development growth and reproduction of h diversicolor in the context of imta 3 2 suicide reproduction and gsi it is important to anticipate reproduction especially when it is associated to death as is the case for semelparous species in ragworm aquaculture harvesting would have to be performed just before reproduction when worms have reached minimum market size 0 5 g ww nesto et al 2012 in our study observations of the first mortalities attributed to suicide reproduction were made on day 144 mean survival of 94 on day 211 mortality reached 43 for individuals fed fish faeces and 52 for individuals fed fish feed using deb simulation we were able to attribute a gsi to these individuals figure 3 we used a gsi of 3 as a threshold for harvesting the individuals during the bioremediation simulations indeed under a gsi of 3 a survival rate above 90 was estimated figure 3 this threshold was estimated from our growth experiment only further studies in which gsi is measured on live animals are therefore needed to confirm this threshold environmental factors may greatly influence reproduction including temperature and photoperiod variations scaps 2002 nesto et al 2018 in a natural environment olive and garwood 1981 observed the first appearance of developed oocytes in h diversicolor coelom after 18 months in our study polychaetes started to reproduce after 5 months which may indicate that aquaculture conditions with a stable temperature and stable feed input were more favourable to ragworms than natural conditions maturation around 4 months under control environment has been observed previously nesto et al 2012 the deb framework allows simulations to be performed in an environment in which food and temperature vary over time and therefore estimations of in situ age at death i e reproduction could be performed in the wild as long as temperatures and food conditions are available 3 3 oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion rates the results showed that oxygen consumption metabolic rate and ammonia excretion rates increased with body size ww and l3 and temperature figures 4 and 5 the deb outputs for oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion at different temperatures correctly fit observed data despite the wide variability in oxygen consumption ranging from 0 09 to 2 35 μmol h 1 figure 4 galasso et al 2018 and ammonia excretion ranging from 4 10 6 to 0 58 µmol h 1 figure 5 the fit between the oxygen consumption data and the predictions was better than for the ammonia excretion data with respective mres of 0 51 and 0 80 it appeared that the ammonia results were underestimated by the model the ammonia results were more scattered than the oxygen consumption rate results the incubation times was short to keep a good oxygen saturation and concentrations were close to the detection limit a longer incubation period and no previous starvation may have provided less variable data in marine species an increase in ammonia excretion with increased temperature is well known including for invertebrates chen and lai 1993 in contrast to fish very little is known regarding the ammonia excretion mechanism and the participating excretory organs in marine invertebrates especially in polychaetes thiel et al 2017 thus our study provides valuable data on this topic which will need further quantitative data in order to properly characterize nutrient fluxes in imtas 3 4 bioremediation potential we found that growth rates increased with increasing temperatures figure 6 and scaled functional response f figure 7 for the bioremediation estimation simulations were stopped when gsi reached 3 or 0 5 g ww considered as the minimum market size the results from selected scenarios are shown in table 3 at 20 c an increased assimilation rate higher f reduced the time to reach the gsi threshold 99 days with f 0 5 vs 79 days with f 1 at this stage ragworms weighed only 0 2 g at f 0 5 compared to 0 6 g when f 1 at the maximum assimilation rate f 1 increased temperature 5 c vs 25 c decreased the time to reach a gsi of 3 163 days at 5 c vs 64 days at 25 c but had no effect on the final wet weight 0 6 g similar observations were made when simulations were stopped at a wet weight of 0 5 g it should be noted that at 20 c with f 0 5 the minimum market size of 0 5 g was reached in 128 days but with a gsi of 3 9 in a bioremediation perspective the potential of h diversicolor was estimated based on cumulated assimilation rates ṗa assuming an energy content of 10 4 kj g 1 dw of seabass faeces and based on the high density of h diversicolor 3700 ind m 2 reported in nature scaps 2002 we estimated a bioremediation capacity ranging from 0 23 to 0 87 g faeces dw ind 1 year 1 eq of 755 to 2887 g faeces dw m 2 year 1 table 3 this could represent 75 289 kg for a 100 m2 ragworm farm equivalent to a 2 9 reduction in the waste produced by a 20t seabass farm 160 kg of dw faeces per ton of seabass production based on assimilation coefficients in brigolin et al 2014 this study therefore confirms the potential of h diversicolor in imta systems in particular associated with fish farms as has been shown in previous studies batista et al 2003 bischoff et al 2009 cubillo et al 2016 and marques et al 2017 comparisons of bioremediation capacity to other studies are however difficult as most of previous studies are site specific or based on specific scenario the quantity of faeces produced by a marine fish farms depends on numerous factors species conversion ratio temperature farm management etc and can vary from 160 kg of dw faeces per ton of seabass production brigolin et al 2014 to 224 kg of dw faeces per ton of salmon production see review by van rijn 2013 wang et al 2019 estimated that 1 kg of fish released 250 g of faeces and 30 g of uneaten feed and could produce 800 g of h diversicolor considering the feed conversion ratio g dry faeces used g polychaete biomass produced of 3 55 given by the authors we could estimate a bioremediation capacity of 23 g of fish faeces eq 9 2 of faeces reduction ragworm density was not provided in this study chary et al 2020 compared studies using mathematical models to examine uptake of solid organic matter or nutrients in imta systems by other detritivores conclusions were quite contrasted chary et al 2020 cubillo et al 2016 and ren et al 2012 predicted that bottom culture of sea cucumbers could remove more than 70 of the benthic particulate organic carbon c from atlantic salmon salmo salar farm units these two studies did not consider rearing constraints limit of density for the extractive species including such considerations in models can help predict more realistic production design and bioremediation potentials from extractive species when considering current density rearing practices watanabe et al 2015 calculated that 4 3 of total particulate nitrogen from milkfish chanos chanos culture could be removed by seacumber detritivore species in the present study the bioremediation potential was expressed per individual and per m 2 and for a large range of temperature to allow future comparisons the deb model allows simulations to be performed that may be useful to predict life history traits in different environmental conditions as well as to anticipate harvest before reproduction 4 conclusion our results suggest that fish waste could constitute the exclusive source of food for the polychaete hediste diversicolor we were able to obtain these results using a deb model that accurately predicted the species metabolic processes further studies could build on these results by including certain environmental factors such as water salinity photoperiod as well as other water temperature variations that may trigger reproduction these findings suggest that deb modelling is a promising tool for imta development the method could help fish producers manage the use of h diversicolor to complement their primary production and could also assist environmental policy by utilizing the bioremediation potential of h diversicolor when associated to fish production credit authorship contribution

24731,integrated multi trophic aquaculture imta systems have been designed to optimize nutrient and energy use to decrease waste and to diversify fish farm production recently the development of detritivorous aquaculture has been encouraged as detrivores can consume organic particulate matter reducing benthic eutrophication and the environmental footprint of aquaculture to this end the polychaete hediste diversicolor is a promising species due to its broad feeding behaviour and its resistance in a wide range of environments in this study an existing dynamic energy budget deb model of h diversicolor was used to predict the ragworm s metabolic processes in various environmental conditions and to estimate its bioremediation capacity in an aquaculture context first the scaled functional response f was calibrated in a 98 day growth experiment with two types of food fish faeces and fish feed then we further validated the model using data on the ammonia excretion and oxygen consumption of individuals fed with fish faeces at four different temperatures using the previously calibrated f overall we found that the deb model was able to correctly predict the experimental data 0 51 mre 0 80 lastly different environmental scenarios of seawater temperatures and assimilation rates were compared the bioremediation potential of h diversicolor was estimated based on cumulated assimilation rates which could represent 75 289 kg of fish waste year 1 for a 100 m2 ragworm farm 3700 ind m 2 these findings suggest that the deb model is a promising tool for further imta development and management keywords deb deposit feeders fish waste metabolism ragworm semelparous bioenergetics 1 introduction fed aquaculture can impact ecosystems through the release of organic matter and dissolved nutrients hargrave 2005 one way to minimize aquaculture waste is to develop integrated multi trophic aquaculture imta in which organisms of different trophic levels are co cultured on the same farm chopin et al 2012 this type of aquaculture can include fed species e g finfish or shrimp as well as extractive species such as algae that can feed on dissolved inorganic waste generated by the fed species abreu et al 2011 erler et al 2000 or filter feeders and detritivores that can feed on generated organic waste jiang et al 2013 neori et al 2004 in open water particulate organic matter fluxes faeces and uneaten feed are mainly vertical filgueira et al 2017 and may accumulate on the bottom sediment both within the farm site and close to it inducing benthic eutrophication hargrave 2005 the quantity and biochemical composition of the nutrients and organic matter released depends on the cultured species the farm size the feed composition and the rearing conditions brigolin et al 2010 using detritivore species in imta may improve the mineralization of organic matter through bioturbation processes hedman et al 2011 and feeding cammen 1980 thus preventing benthic eutrophication the bioremediation potential of several detritivorous species has been evaluated including fish katz et al 2002 porter et al 1996 sea cucumbers cubillo et al 2016 macdonald et al 2013 nelson et al 2012 paltzat et al 2008 chary et al 2020 sea urchins cook and kelly 2007 orr et al 2014 and polychaetes fang et al 2017 marques et al 2017 among polychaetes hediste nereis diversicolor o f müller 1776 has been widely studied gillet et al 2008 mermillod blondin et al 2004 similar to other nereididae this species plays an important ecological role by constructing burrows in sediment to create galleries their bioturbation and ventilation activities promote nutrient fluxes between water and sediment favouring the oxygenation of the sediment michaud et al 2006 and enhancing organic matter mineralization and nutrient recycling heilskov and holmer 2001 additionally h diversicolor can cope with a large range of environmental conditions in terms of variation in organic matter loading temperature and salinity kristensen 1983 ozoh and jones 1990 moreover its feeding behaviour is diversified it is considered a detritivore carnivore herbivore suspension feeder and even an optional filter feeder nielsen et al 1995 riisgård 1994 more recently the biomitigation activity of this species has been explored cubillo et al 2016 marques et al 2017 papaspyrou et al 2010 and studies have demonstrated that individuals can grow significantly when fed on fish waste bischoff et al 2009 wang et al 2019 cubillo et al 2016 and marques et al 2017 have also shown that h diversicolor could assimilate particulate organic matter from fish farms confirming its potential for imta however these studies were carried out under specific temperature and salinity conditions making predicting the bioremediation capacity in other environmental conditions difficult in this context mechanistic models can be useful tools as they can simulate physiological and ecological processes under a large range of environmental conditions starting from empirical results in a limited number of environmental conditions this modelling framework allows these results to be extrapolated in order to predict the metabolic responses of individuals in other environmental conditions reid et al 2020 bioenergetic models are based on the fluxes and conservation of energy in physiological processes in which energy available for somatic growth is estimated as a result of feeding and excretion brett and groves 1979 the model chosen in this study was the dynamic energy budget deb model kooijman 2010 which is based on the use of energy by an organism for physiological processes such as food assimilation growth maintenance and reproduction this model has been demonstrated to correctly model the lifecycle of a wide range of species from bacteria to large mammals the framework provided by the deb theory allows the quantification of processes of interest for aquaculture such as growth and feeding efficiency and of increasing interest for imta such as the bioremediation capacity of extractive species reid et al 2020 chary et al 2020 the associated deb parameters for more than 2000 modelled species to date are available on the online platform add my pet amp www bio vu nl thb deb deblab add my pet of these species 7 are polychaetes with the recent additions of arenicola marina de cubber et al 2019 and hediste diversicolor lefebvre 2019 these deb model parameters for h diversicolor can now be used to predict metabolic processes under different environmental conditions the aim of this study was to analyze the mitigation potential of deposit feeding h diversicolor in co cultivation with finfish the objectives were 1 to validate the deb model using new datasets obtained through laboratory experiments on growth rates and ammonia excretion as well as data on oxygen consumption published independently of the calibration procedure 2 to evaluate the effects of seawater temperatures 5 c to 25 c and assimilation rates from ad libitum to half an ad libitum ration on some life history traits of h diversicolor and 3 to quantify the bioremediation potential of h diversicolor in different aquaculture contexts 2 material and methods 2 1 the deb theory and the lifecycle of h diversicolor a general presentation of the deb theory and its mathematical formulation is presented in supplementary material see s1 to perform the deb simulations for h diversicolor we used the available parameters in the amp database lefebvre 2019 table 1 using an abj model essentially the deb theory is based on the assumption that assimilated energy first enters a reserve compartment e a fixed fraction κ of the energy flux coming from the reserve is then utilized first for somatic maintenance costs and the remaining part for growth of the structural volume v the other fraction 1 κ is spent on maturation eh in juveniles or on reproduction er in adults after having paid the maturity maintenance costs figure 1 acquisition processes i e ingestion and assimilation are linked to the organism s surface area while somatic maintenance is proportional to its volume in contrast to the standard version of the deb model std the abj model considers a metabolic acceleration between birth and metamorphosis see s1 consequently we scaled maximum surface specific assimilation p a m and energy conductance v to the organism s structural length between birth and metamorphosis following kooijman et al 2011 finally as it is a semelparous species h diversicolor dies after its first reproduction olive and garwood 1981 therefore the maximum structural length lm was the structural length of the animal that attains first reproduction in deb theory authors refer to this reproductive strategy as suicide reproduction kooijman 2010 the deb model describes changes in the energy content of four state variables e v eh and er for adults which cannot be measured directly the volumetric structural length l v1 3 can be approximated by the shape corrected physical observable length δm lw in this study the length cm of the first three segments l3 the combined length of the prostomium peristomium and the first setiger was used as the physical length as this is more reliable than the total length in polychaetes wet weight ww was calculated as the sum of the wet mass of the structure and the wet mass of the reserve see s1 the wet mass of the reproductive buffer was not included in the ww calculation because it was considered negligible most of the time gsi 3 see below 2 2 h diversicolor growth performance in controlled environments 2 2 1 sampling h diversicolor individuals were collected in the wild in arnel lagoon on the french mediterranean coast the experiments were conducted in the ifremer marine aquaculture experimental station palavas les flots france for the oxygen and excretion experiments individuals were acclimatized for 10 days see details below for the growth experiment in vitro reproduction was carried out in october 2016 in order to begin with individuals of the same age during the early larvae stage from 0 to 22 days the polychaete offspring were fed with microalgae chlorella sp which were cultured at the experimental station and can be ingested this was confirmed by microscopic observation of the gut content before the beginning of the growth experiment juveniles from 22 to 113 days were fed with fish faeces and raised at temperatures ranging between 15 c and 18 c this food was chosen because fish farm waste is mainly composed of fish faeces and a varying proportion of uneaten fish feed galasso et al 2017 2 2 2 growth rates the growth experiment was conducted on individuals when they reached 113 days of age the experiment lasted 98 days february april 2017 two types of feed were tested faeces from farmed european seabass dicentrarchus labrax fish faeces and commercial fish feed fish feed the collection and preparation of these are detailed in galasso et al 2017 the fish faeces were composed of 72 organic matter om including 3 total organic nitrogen ton and 7 total lipids tl and 28 ash the commercial fish feed was composed of 87 om including 7 ton and 12 tl and 12 ash polychaetes were fed ad libitum based on the observation of leftover food in the tank from 48 mg feed ind 1 d 1 to 85 mg ind 1 d 1 from the beginning to the end of the experiment the 113 1 day old individuals days post fertilization at the start of the growth experiment measured on average 1 16 0 24 mm l3 each treatment was performed in small tanks 4 l in triplicate 6 tanks 18 polychaetes per tank total of 108 worms the water temperature was maintained at 17 1 c and at a salinity of 18 1 psu temperature and salinity conditions favourable to hediste growth olivier et al 1996 batista et al 2003 the worms were reared without sediment but plastic tubes ø 4 mm several lengths were added to provide refuge to reduce stress adapted from nesto et al 2018 the tanks were continuously aerated to maintain oxygen concentration close to saturation for the given temperature galasso et al 2018 individual wet weight was measured on days 177 and 211 and individual l3 length on days 113 144 177 and 211 the worms were weighed individually after a fasting period of 24 h to empty their digestive tract they were then carefully taken from the water using a dip net cleaned with seawater and dried on paper towels before being weighed on an analytical balance with a precision of 0 001 g specific growth rate was calculated as s g r log w w f log w w i t f 100 where wwi and wwf is the wet weight g at the beginning and the end of the experiment respectively and t is the experiment duration d hopkins 1992 a two way anova was performed to test the effect of food type fixed factor n 2 fish feed and fish faeces and tank random factor n 3 on ww and l3 at each biometry data in total 54 individuals were measured per food type 2 2 3 oxygen consumption the oxygen consumption rates of the ragworms were recorded as a proxy of the minimal metabolic rate the standard metabolic rate at four temperatures 11 c 17 c 22 c and 27 c the oxygen consumption could be considered a proxy of the minimal metabolic rate as it was measured on individuals that had fasted for 24 h in the dark a detailed description of the experiments and results are presented in galasso et al 2018 the individuals ranged from 0 02 to 0 57 g ww and 1 40 to 3 64 mm l3 the polychaetes were acclimatized for 10 days and fed ad libitum with seabass dicentrarchus labrax faeces then acclimatized for 7 days at the experimental temperature conditions the incubation times were chosen to prevent oxygen saturation from dropping below 80 consequently incubation times varied from 4 h for the aquariums at 22 c and 27 c to 5 h for those at 11 c and 17 c the results were expressed in µmol h 2 2 4 ammonia excretion an ammonia excretion experiment was performed simultaneously with oxygen consumption measurements water samples 50 ml were taken at the beginning of the experiment t 0 filtered seawater was used to fill the individual chambers and at the end of incubation tf and immediately frozen at 20 c for further ammonium analyses n nh4 the ammonium concentrations were measured using seal aa3 analytical autoanalyser standard methods aminot and kérouel 2007 with fluorometric detection from jasco fp 2020plus france ammonia excretion rates were determined following the equation used by galasso et al 2018 for oxygen n nh4 was transformed to n nh3 using the conversion factor 1 22 based on molar mass 2 3 comparison between predicted and observed data simulations were then carried out to compare the output of the model to data from laboratory experiments on growth performance oxygen consumption j o and ammonia excretion j n in deb theory j o and j n are weighted sums of three basic fluxes assimilation p a dissipation p d and growth p g see s1 for details and equations first optimizations of scaled functional response f were performed to evaluate the assimilation rate of the polychaetes this was performed using the cma es function from the cmaes package in r trautmann et al 2011 run to minimize the mean relative error mre between predicted and observed data first an f value was obtained for the period prior to the growth experiment until 113 days of age and then an f value was fitted for each feeding condition fish faeces or fish feed in the growth experiment the last l3 length was not used in the fitting process because of high size specific mortality related to reproduction as individuals become green at maturity dales 1950 we used this criteria to remove these individuals from the group and from the dataset water temperatures during the different experiments were included in the model second since the oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion experiment was performed using individuals fed on faeces the f fitted using the growth experiment on individuals fed faeces was used for simulating these variables in addition as the polychaetes used in the respiration and excretion experiment were collected in the wild the age and life histories of these individuals were unknown the scaling with the length and weight was therefore obtained using the deb model run for individuals with identical life histories but different ages therefore all the observed differences in lengths within this experiment were linked to differences in age finally since the experiment was performed on polychaetes that had been starved for 24 h we assumed that the oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion associated to energy assimilation was null p a 0 2 4 imta scenarios temperature and assimilation rates 2 4 1 effects of temperature and assimilation rate variations we evaluated the effects of two key factors that may affect growth temperature and assimilation rates as temperature is the main factor in metabolism changes especially in ectotherms wieser 1973 the effect of a large range of temperatures from 5 c to 25 c in 5 c increments with fixed optimal feeding conditions scaled functional response f 1 was tested this range was selected based on temperature variations observed in h diversicolor habitats scaps 2002 and temperatures that are recorded in european aquaculture production from norway to mediterranean sea ex brigolin et al 2014 wang et al 2020 assimilation rates were also tested with f ranging from 0 5 to 1 half ration of ad libitum to full ad libitum in 0 1 increments at a constant 20 c temperature the gonadosomatic index gsi is the ratio between gonad mass and total body mass using deb theory gsi is estimated as the ratio between the reproduction buffer wet mass and the wet weight of the animal see s1 the gsi could therefore be estimated for each age in the growth experiment in parallel survival was recorded during the growth experiment it was assumed to be mostly related to the spawning event and the associated death of the animals we posited that spawning was triggered above a certain gsi threshold the survival curve was fitted over time using a sigmoid function with the nls function in r 3 6 2 and rstudio 1 2 5033 this enabled us to create a link between the estimated gsi and survival the curve was fitted with a polynomial curve of degree 5 using the poly function in r in order to obtain links between survival and any gsi only the results from the growth experiment using faeces were used for these estimations since faeces are intended to be the most important food source in a well designed imta system a gsi of 3 was chosen for the bioremediation simulations since survival was high until this threshold 90 2 4 2 bioremediation capacity to estimate the bioremediation capacity of polychaete to consume fish solid wastes total assimilated energy was estimated over a ragworm production cycle from birth to harvest in several scenarios at 20 c with f 0 5 or f 1 and at 5 c and 25 c with f 1 in aquaculture a good compromise between reaching commercial weight and survival rates has to be found for each scenario simulations were either stopped when the gsi reached 3 or when individual reached 0 5 g ww minimum polychaete market size nesto et al 2012 total assimilated energy j was then transformed into grams of dry weight g dw of faeces considering that the energy content of one g dw of fish faeces was 10 4 kj we based our estimation on the average composition of seabass faeces proteins 14 lipids 4 6 carbohydrates 12 8 fibre 40 6 and ash 28 galasso et al 2017 and the associated respective energy contents of 23 6 kj g 1 36 2 kj g 1 17 2 kj g 1 8 kj g 1 and 0 kj g 1 brigolin et al 2014 chary et al 2020 based on information provided in another study scaps 2002 we considered a population density of 3700 ind m 2 and estimated the bioremediation capacity of a ragworm farm per m2 for a year round production considering the life expectancy of the ragworms and the control of h diversicolor reproduction wang et al 2020 3 results and discussion the results from our simulations obtained for h diversicolor using deb theory provided a good fit with new empirical data on growth oxygen consumption and excretion in aquaculture conditions this new empirical data set was not used for the optimization of the parameters available online lefebvre 2019 and therefore we applied it in order to independently validate the parameter set 3 1 growth rates and food quality the effect of the two food types fish faeces and fish feed on the growth rates of hediste diversicolor are presented in table 2 after 98 days of the experiment polychaetes fed with fish faeces had a slightly ns higher final weight 0 41 0 17 g and length l3 0 30 0 05 cm than those fed with fish feed ww 0 36 0 15 g and l3 0 28 0 06 cm significant difference between treatment was only observed on day 177 two way anova test see table 2 individual growth rates from day 113 to 177 were 0 03 mm l3 d 1 and 5 mg ww d 1 3 8 sgr for faeces and 0 02 mm l3 d 1 and 4 2 mg ww d 1 3 5 sgr for feed we used the deb model as an explanatory tool to estimate scaled functional response f levels in our growth experiment f were estimated at 0 6 and 0 5 for fish faeces and fish feed respectively resulting in slightly higher growth rates for h diversicolor feed with fish faeces the deb simulation fit well with observed length data in the growth experiment figure 2 with an mre of 0 11 in results obtained in other studies a high variation in growth rates has been observed in relation to food quality for example in similar conditions of temperature and salinity 25 psu 18 c and for comparable initial weights 50 mg ww lower growth rates 2 1 mg ww d 1 1 8 sgr were measured for h diversicolor fed with macroalgae olivier et al 1996 meziane and retiere 2002 obtained even lower growth rates 0 5 to 2 8 mg ww d 1 0 3 to 1 9 sgr for ragworms fed with halophyte detritus in similar environmental conditions 15 psu 21 c however fidalgo e costa et al 2000 measured growth rates of 14 mg ww d 1 5 5 sgr feeding h diversicolor with a post larval shrimp diet 15 psu and 20 c high growth rates 6 to 12 d 1 sgr were also recorded in nesto et al 2012 who tested three different sources of food including larviva biomar and a seaweed sargassum muticum a low protein food in h diversicolor cultures in fact this last study was used in the parameter estimation procedure for h diversicolor lefebvre 2019 add my pet considering a maximal functional response for the best food source f 1 wang et al 2019 observed that h diversicolor reared on fish feed 0 025 d 1 sgr grew significantly faster than worms grown on the other diets including smolt waste 0 012 d 1 sgr the difference between their growth rates and the rates measured in our study may originate from varying food quality and other different experimental conditions i e presence absence of sediment indeed in our experiment food was provided ad libitum suggesting that f 1 the fitted f values of 0 5 and 0 6 obtained in our study probably result from a lower digestibility of fish waste compared to other food sources see lefebvre et al 2000 further experiments could be performed to investigate these hypotheses nevertheless our results showed that despite differences in food quality growth rates were in the range of other studies more importantly although fish waste does not lead to the best sgr compared to other studies our results indicate that it is a suitable food type for the development growth and reproduction of h diversicolor in the context of imta 3 2 suicide reproduction and gsi it is important to anticipate reproduction especially when it is associated to death as is the case for semelparous species in ragworm aquaculture harvesting would have to be performed just before reproduction when worms have reached minimum market size 0 5 g ww nesto et al 2012 in our study observations of the first mortalities attributed to suicide reproduction were made on day 144 mean survival of 94 on day 211 mortality reached 43 for individuals fed fish faeces and 52 for individuals fed fish feed using deb simulation we were able to attribute a gsi to these individuals figure 3 we used a gsi of 3 as a threshold for harvesting the individuals during the bioremediation simulations indeed under a gsi of 3 a survival rate above 90 was estimated figure 3 this threshold was estimated from our growth experiment only further studies in which gsi is measured on live animals are therefore needed to confirm this threshold environmental factors may greatly influence reproduction including temperature and photoperiod variations scaps 2002 nesto et al 2018 in a natural environment olive and garwood 1981 observed the first appearance of developed oocytes in h diversicolor coelom after 18 months in our study polychaetes started to reproduce after 5 months which may indicate that aquaculture conditions with a stable temperature and stable feed input were more favourable to ragworms than natural conditions maturation around 4 months under control environment has been observed previously nesto et al 2012 the deb framework allows simulations to be performed in an environment in which food and temperature vary over time and therefore estimations of in situ age at death i e reproduction could be performed in the wild as long as temperatures and food conditions are available 3 3 oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion rates the results showed that oxygen consumption metabolic rate and ammonia excretion rates increased with body size ww and l3 and temperature figures 4 and 5 the deb outputs for oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion at different temperatures correctly fit observed data despite the wide variability in oxygen consumption ranging from 0 09 to 2 35 μmol h 1 figure 4 galasso et al 2018 and ammonia excretion ranging from 4 10 6 to 0 58 µmol h 1 figure 5 the fit between the oxygen consumption data and the predictions was better than for the ammonia excretion data with respective mres of 0 51 and 0 80 it appeared that the ammonia results were underestimated by the model the ammonia results were more scattered than the oxygen consumption rate results the incubation times was short to keep a good oxygen saturation and concentrations were close to the detection limit a longer incubation period and no previous starvation may have provided less variable data in marine species an increase in ammonia excretion with increased temperature is well known including for invertebrates chen and lai 1993 in contrast to fish very little is known regarding the ammonia excretion mechanism and the participating excretory organs in marine invertebrates especially in polychaetes thiel et al 2017 thus our study provides valuable data on this topic which will need further quantitative data in order to properly characterize nutrient fluxes in imtas 3 4 bioremediation potential we found that growth rates increased with increasing temperatures figure 6 and scaled functional response f figure 7 for the bioremediation estimation simulations were stopped when gsi reached 3 or 0 5 g ww considered as the minimum market size the results from selected scenarios are shown in table 3 at 20 c an increased assimilation rate higher f reduced the time to reach the gsi threshold 99 days with f 0 5 vs 79 days with f 1 at this stage ragworms weighed only 0 2 g at f 0 5 compared to 0 6 g when f 1 at the maximum assimilation rate f 1 increased temperature 5 c vs 25 c decreased the time to reach a gsi of 3 163 days at 5 c vs 64 days at 25 c but had no effect on the final wet weight 0 6 g similar observations were made when simulations were stopped at a wet weight of 0 5 g it should be noted that at 20 c with f 0 5 the minimum market size of 0 5 g was reached in 128 days but with a gsi of 3 9 in a bioremediation perspective the potential of h diversicolor was estimated based on cumulated assimilation rates ṗa assuming an energy content of 10 4 kj g 1 dw of seabass faeces and based on the high density of h diversicolor 3700 ind m 2 reported in nature scaps 2002 we estimated a bioremediation capacity ranging from 0 23 to 0 87 g faeces dw ind 1 year 1 eq of 755 to 2887 g faeces dw m 2 year 1 table 3 this could represent 75 289 kg for a 100 m2 ragworm farm equivalent to a 2 9 reduction in the waste produced by a 20t seabass farm 160 kg of dw faeces per ton of seabass production based on assimilation coefficients in brigolin et al 2014 this study therefore confirms the potential of h diversicolor in imta systems in particular associated with fish farms as has been shown in previous studies batista et al 2003 bischoff et al 2009 cubillo et al 2016 and marques et al 2017 comparisons of bioremediation capacity to other studies are however difficult as most of previous studies are site specific or based on specific scenario the quantity of faeces produced by a marine fish farms depends on numerous factors species conversion ratio temperature farm management etc and can vary from 160 kg of dw faeces per ton of seabass production brigolin et al 2014 to 224 kg of dw faeces per ton of salmon production see review by van rijn 2013 wang et al 2019 estimated that 1 kg of fish released 250 g of faeces and 30 g of uneaten feed and could produce 800 g of h diversicolor considering the feed conversion ratio g dry faeces used g polychaete biomass produced of 3 55 given by the authors we could estimate a bioremediation capacity of 23 g of fish faeces eq 9 2 of faeces reduction ragworm density was not provided in this study chary et al 2020 compared studies using mathematical models to examine uptake of solid organic matter or nutrients in imta systems by other detritivores conclusions were quite contrasted chary et al 2020 cubillo et al 2016 and ren et al 2012 predicted that bottom culture of sea cucumbers could remove more than 70 of the benthic particulate organic carbon c from atlantic salmon salmo salar farm units these two studies did not consider rearing constraints limit of density for the extractive species including such considerations in models can help predict more realistic production design and bioremediation potentials from extractive species when considering current density rearing practices watanabe et al 2015 calculated that 4 3 of total particulate nitrogen from milkfish chanos chanos culture could be removed by seacumber detritivore species in the present study the bioremediation potential was expressed per individual and per m 2 and for a large range of temperature to allow future comparisons the deb model allows simulations to be performed that may be useful to predict life history traits in different environmental conditions as well as to anticipate harvest before reproduction 4 conclusion our results suggest that fish waste could constitute the exclusive source of food for the polychaete hediste diversicolor we were able to obtain these results using a deb model that accurately predicted the species metabolic processes further studies could build on these results by including certain environmental factors such as water salinity photoperiod as well as other water temperature variations that may trigger reproduction these findings suggest that deb modelling is a promising tool for imta development the method could help fish producers manage the use of h diversicolor to complement their primary production and could also assist environmental policy by utilizing the bioremediation potential of h diversicolor when associated to fish production credit authorship contribution

24732,agricultural land expansion and intensification driven by human consumption of agricultural goods are among the major threats to environmental degradation and biodiversity conservation land degradation can ultimately hamper agricultural production through a decrease in ecosystem services thus designing viable land use policies is a key sustainability challenge we develop a model describing the coupled dynamics of human demography and landscape composition while imposing a trade off between agricultural expansion and intensification we model land use strategies spanning from low intensity agriculture and high land conversion rates per person to high intensity agriculture and low land conversion rates per person and explore their consequences on the long term dynamics of the coupled human land system we seek to characterise the strategies viability in the long run and understand the mechanisms that potentially lead to large scale land degradation and population collapse due to resource scarcity we show that the viability of land use strategies strongly depends on the land s intrinsic recovery rate we also find that socio ecological collapses occur when agricultural intensification is not accompanied by a sufficient decrease in land conversion based on these findings we stress the dangers of uninformed land use planning and the importance of precautionary behaviour for land use management and land use policy design keywords socio ecological modelling land use planning agricultural intensification agricultural expansion socio ecological collapse policies for sustainability 1 introduction food production is the most basic and tangible example of humans dependence on nature from paleolithic hunter gatherers who relied on direct harvest from nature to contemporary complex societies that rely on agriculture and livestock human survival ultimately depends on what the land provides an ever growing population and demand for food are putting unprecedented pressure on the environment tscharntke et al 2012 increased food consumption necessitates agriculture expansion however the last ipbes report bongaarts 2019 highlights the role of agricultural land expansion as the main threat to biodiversity loss mediated by the fragmentation and degradation of habitats corvalán et al 2005 jacobson et al 2019 nowosad and stepinski 2019 degradation of the natural environment brings societal and economic consequences for human populations as it can result in decreasing agricultural yields mitchell et al 2014 and public health issues power 2010 conservation of biodiversity and natural spaces are often considered secondary objectives when compared to food security but biodiversity and ecosystem services play an integral role in maintaining food supply agricultural productivity is strongly dependent on ecosystem services such as pollination nutrient cycling and pest control that surrounding natural spaces provide mitchell et al 2013 therefore conservation goals should not be seen as opposed to agricultural production or human well being as natural land is essential to provisioning services braat and de groot 2012 cazalis et al 2018 allying natural and agricultural lands is the key to achieve sustainability and avoid a potential socio ecological collapse the introduction of agriculture permitted the apparition of the first permanent human settlements however neolithic settlements quickly became heavily reliant on the agricultural system and as a result when environmental disasters struck the food supply and the population suffered downey et al 2016 in some cases as much as 60 of the population was lost due to failed crops over time technological developments made it possible for human societies to adopt more intense forms of agriculture which increased resource production and food security agricultural production enabled the population to grow and allowed the development of complex societies via social differentiation and territorial expansion kuijt and goring morris 2002 this drive to increase agricultural production however led to deforestation defries et al 2010 excessive freshwater use lilienfeld and asmild 2007 soil biodiversity loss tsiafouli et al 2015 altered nutrient quinton et al 2010 and water cycles davidson et al 2012 decreased pollinator abundance and increased vulnerability to environmental change all of which can have deleterious effects on agricultural production agriculture is thus dependent on the natural environment but it also heavily transforms this environment the aim of future societies is to have agriculture improve social welfare but how to achieve this while limiting environmental degradation is a major unknown agriculture has been responsible for both the rise and fall of societies historical examples of societal collapse are geographically diverse and have occurred over various time scales cumming and peterson 2017 several social political and economical mechanisms have been proposed to explain such collapses tainter 1988 however for a number of them the roots of societal decline can be traced back to ecological problems caused by resource over exploitation and poor agricultural land management the mayan and the anasazi collapses are two classic examples in both cases collapse is thought to have resulted from feedbacks between population growth and agricultural expansion and intensification which led to greater environmental degradation and made the food production system unviable cumming and peterson 2017 diamond 2005 roman et al 2018 food scarcity sows the seeds of economic trouble social unease and political instability which trap societies in positive feedback loop leading to collapse the current environmental crisis has reignited scientific interest in societal collapse there is a general agreement that overpopulation and overconsumption are the main threats to environmental conservation and sustainability barrett et al 2020 thus recent studies have addressed sustainability questions by explicitly considering human demography and consumption behaviour in particular modelling approaches have shown great potential to shed light on sustainability challenges as they allow the exploration of different scenarios that would be impossible to reproduce experimentally in a recent study motesharrei et al 2014 used a dynamical model to show how social inequalities in terms of resource consumption and contribution to labour can undermine sustainability and cause societal collapses this finding can be linked to other issues such as population growth kentor 2001 and over consumption ceballos et al 2017 which contribute to environmental degradation and social instability more recently henderson and loreau 2018 and henderson and loreau 2019 proposed a general theoretical framework to explain human demography across history in relation to resource accessibility which can be used to explain the population explosion in the last century and potential future scenarios broadening the spectrum of possible connections between nature and human populations cazalis et al 2018 built a model to explore socio ecological dynamics through the dependence of humans on several ecosystem services through an economic ecological model lafuite et al 2017 2018 lafuite and loreau 2017 investigated how time lags in the response of biodiversity to anthropic perturbations can feedback on the human population via shortages in food production and undermine the sustainability of the socio ecological system these studies provide the basis for our work showing a link between humans and the environment through food consumption which we represent by feedbacks between human population growth and agricultural land use research on sustainable agricultural land use has led to the land sharing sparing debate grau et al 2013 power 2010 whether it is better to protect larger areas of natural land and cultivate high intensity fields on the remaining land or protect smaller areas of natural land while practicing wild life friendly low intensity agriculture is a question that has not yet been fully answered different authors often arrive at different conclusions some defending the sparing intensification paradigm balmford et al 2019 phalan et al 2011a 2011b and others the sharing or agroecological one perfecto and vandermeer 2010 power 2010 the sparing sharing debate has been criticized for omitting the coupling between land use and human demography phalan 2018 furthermore the discussion generally examines discrete opposing strategies yet there is an entire spectrum between these two extremes the impact of agricultural intensification on sustainability is an important issue at present as in the developing countries foreign demand is fueling the conversion of large areas of natural land into intensively cultivated monocultures fearnside 2001 pengue 2005 reboratti 2010 soares filho et al 2006 the result is a uniform landscape that is highly vulnerable to environmental fluctuations destruction of natural habitats fragmentation contamination of underground water sources and nutrient runoff these practices are detrimental to the environment but agriculture is necessary to feed the population it is obvious that a balance needs to be achieved between food production and natural land conservation as the actions taken today could jeopardize the population s viability in the long run here we build a model to explore the effects of different agricultural land use strategies on long term human environment dynamics through a simple and tractable model accounting for the interaction between human demography and land dynamics we study the viability of agricultural socio ecological systems under different land use strategies along an intensification expansion spectrum we introduce a trade off between intensification and the land conversion effort and investigate for which land use strategies the population collapses due to land degradation our central premise is that increasing agricultural production can promote further population growth thus agricultural intensification via increasing agricultural yields can have a positive feedback on human demography initiating the need for larger production and therefore causing further natural land conversion to agriculture which eventually leads to a more degraded landscape we test the conditions under which increasing agricultural intensification fails to spare enough natural land and promotes unsustainable population growth pushing the environment through a tipping point and ultimately leading the social ecological system to collapse 2 model description 2 1 bidirectional coupling between human demography and land dynamics our model considers the conversion of natural land to agricultural land in relation to the demand from the human population as population dynamics are driven by the resources humans can access and consume they ultimately depend on the landscape s composition resource production depends on the landscape composition but also on agricultural intensity we conceive agricultural land use along two dimensions the conversion effort which controls the spatial extension of agricultural land and agricultural intensity in the model humans adopt a land use strategy ranging from low intensity and high land conversion rates to high intensity and low land conversion rates this negative relation between agricultural intensity and the land conversion effort is grounded in the land sparing sharing debate highly expansive and intense agricultural land uses have been identified as unsustainable hence the debate is whether the focus to achieve sustainability should be put on increasing intensification to reduce the converted areas or extensification to have a wildlife friendly agricultural landscape we aim to reproduce these two strategic poles by imposing a trade off between agricultural intensity and land conversion effort hence reducing the two strategical dimensions to a single parameter in this study we do not consider the evolution of the strategy over time and assume it remains constant agricultural land is exhausted and degraded at different rates depending on the surrounding landscape and ultimately becomes unproductive cramer et al 2008 henderson and loreau 2019 natural land contributes to the recovery of surrounding land acting for example as a species pool necessary for recolonization by native species baeten et al 2010 cramer et al 2008 hence fragmentation of natural areas and degradation of natural patches surrounding degraded land can obstruct its spontaneous recovery on the other hand natural land can also become degraded indeed a degraded state of land can propagate into a natural one as is the case with a desertification front that propagates on semi arid landscapes zelnik and meron 2018 zelnik et al 2017 the balance between the recovery and degradation processes depends not only on the extension of both natural and degraded land but also on the borders between the two types of lands and on the level of degradation cramer et al 2008 2 2 human demography a number of studies have discussed the idea of a human carrying capacity and pointed to food supply as one of the main constraints to human population growth cohen 1995 fanta et al 2018 hopfenberg 2003 in this study we follow the same reasoning and assume human population size p follows logistic growth with a carrying capacity that evolves over time subject to changes in food supply the use of the logistic equation to describe the dynamics of human populations has been previously criticized board on environmental change and society et al 2014 mote et al 2020 and other studies have opted to explicitly model fertility and mortality processes by various functions related to consumption levels henderson and loreau 2019 lafuite and loreau 2017 motesharrei et al 2014 furthermore cohen 1995 has stressed the difficulties of estimating a human carrying capacity given that several bio physical and social mechanisms that might constrain human population growth are dynamically evolving and possibly unidentified however historical population trends have been well recovered by logistic models using food dependent carrying capacities fanta et al 2018 goldberg et al 2016 additionally the unprecedented population increase of the 1960s to 2000s was also modelled using a logistic model where hopfenberg 2003 quantified the human carrying capacity using food production showing good agreement with empirical data more recently suweis et al 2013 used the link between water availability and food production to calculate a human carrying capacity based on access to water resources using population data from 1970 to 2011 we assume the human carrying capacity to be the ratio between total resource production and per capita consumption k p y c where y is total resource production depending on the landscape s composition and c is per capita resource consumption as such the carrying capacity endogenously changes over time as food production changes driven by the feedbacks between humans and the landscape for a given consumption intensity the maximum number of humans that can be sustained is then given by the ratio of production over per capita consumption 1 d p d τ r 0 p 1 p k p r 0 p 1 c p y where r 0 is the population s growth rate at very low densities we assume that r 0 and c remain constant over time this is a simplification as it is known that technological developments and cultural evolution have driven changes in human fertility and consumption as well as in agricultural productivity which inevitably impact the human carrying capacity however in this study we do not consider the role of cultural and technological evolution instead we focus on the land dynamics based on a previous model of socio ecological interactions that included variations in food production efficiency cazalis et al 2018 the inclusion of technology in the carrying capacity would likely shift the onset of collapse vary the size of the collapse range and alter the viability range of parameters but would not change the overall or long term trends 2 3 agricultural production the number of resources produced y depends on the area of agricultural land a but also on that of natural n and degraded d land as well as on agricultural intensity β noncultivated land whether natural or degraded provides ecosystem services that are crucial for agricultural production such as pollination nutrient cycling pest control and water quality regulation mitchell et al 2014 however greater land degradation leads to fewer and lower quality ecosystem services therefore we do not consider natural and degraded land to contribute equally to agricultural production instead we introduce an effective land function ϵ l n d β which represents the effective area of non cultivated land that provides ecosystem services to agricultural land 2 ϵ l n 1 β d the contribution of degraded land to effective land decreases with its level of deterioration which in turn depends on the level of agricultural intensification β we assume that more intensive agriculture results in higher degrees of land degradation and as such intensive agriculture transitions to highly degraded land for simplicity the contribution of degraded land to effective land decreases linearly with agricultural intensity we model agricultural resource production y as the sum of the contributions from the total cultivated area area contribution and from the border of agricultural land with non cultivated land both natural and degraded represented by the effective land ϵ l border contribution therefore the area contribution scales with agricultural land area and the border contribution with the square root of agricultural land area furthermore we assume the relative weights of area and border contributions in production depend on agricultural intensity β as agricultural intensification grows production y becomes less dependent on the ecosystem services provided by the surrounding non agricultural land and more dependent on human inputs hence increasing intensification diminishes the border contribution and increases the area contribution on production therefore we assume the area contribution increases linearly with agricultural intensity β while the border contribution decreases linearly with β the amplitude of the area and border contributions is modulated by the functions ya β and yb β these two functions can be interpreted as the characteristic productivity of the area and border contributions respectively for a given agricultural intensity β ya β is the production per unit area of agricultural land and yb β is the production per unit area of effective land per unit length of the agricultural land s border 3 y y a β β a area contribution y b β 1 β ϵ l a border contribution y a β β a q ϵ l 1 β a agricultural intensity β ranges from 0 to 1 0 being extreme low intensity agriculture and 1 extreme high intensity as intensification increases agricultural yields we model the characteristic productivity of the area ya and border yb contributions as increasing functions of agricultural intensification for simplicity we assume a linear dependency i e y a β y a β and y b β y b β the parameters ya and yb are then the productivities per unit of intensification we introduce the parameter q y b y a which represents the relative importance of the border and area contribution to resource production fig 2 shows the magnitude of agricultural resource production as a function of landscape composition when β is close to 0 maximum production is obtained in a landscape where about a third of the land is agricultural the food production is exclusively dependent on the services provided by the non anthropogenic landscape as we assume the services that non cultivated land provides to agricultural land depend both on the area and quality of non cultivated land and on the length of the border between them at this extreme of the spectrum production scales with the square root of agricultural area at the extreme the fraction of natural land is not important because the degradation caused by the agricultural activity is extremely low such that natural and degraded land contribute equally to effective land as β grows the fraction of natural land starts to have an impact as degraded and natural land are not interchangeable anymore when β approaches 1 production becomes exclusively dependent on agricultural land area this is a scenario of extremely high agricultural intensity where agricultural yields become independent of the services provided by the non agricultural landscape and rely exclusively on human inputs such as fertilizers or pesticides in the high intensity case production is proportional to the area of agricultural land fig 2 also shows that yields increase with intensification as maximum attainable production yellow areas in the figure grows with β 2 4 land dynamics agricultural land equation land conversion is driven by the human population s demand for agricultural goods which results on the conversion of natural land to agriculture we assume that demand is equal to the total desired food consumption cp since we aim to investigate the impact of different land use strategies along the intensification extensification spectrum on human land dynamics we impose a trade off between agricultural intensity and land conversion rate we model land conversion rate as a decreasing affine function of agricultural intensity β nutrient runoff and soil erosion cause agricultural land degradation which increases with intensity therefore we model the degradation rate of agricultural land as a linear function of β capturing the fact that high intensity agriculture degrades the land faster than does low intensity agriculture the dynamical equation for the agricultural land area is given by 4 d a d τ k 0 k k 0 1 β c p n conversion e β a degradation parameters k 0 and k are the minimum and maximum conversion rates per unit of demanded resources cp respectively as the demand for resources is proportional to population density k 0 and k are also per capita rates of conversion therefore in the following we will call them per capita conversion rates in the extreme high intensity scenario β 1 the conversion rate per person is at its minimum k 0 in the extreme low intensity scenario β 0 the conversion rate per person is at its maximum k 2 5 land dynamics natural land equation apart from being converted to agriculture natural land area can either increase through the spontaneous recovery of degraded land or decrease by the propagation of the degraded state of land the natural land at the edges of degraded land fosters its spontaneous recovery through both biotic and abiotic processes it acts as a species pool promoting native species recolonization or as a source of good quality water or chemical compounds to restore soil chemistry baeten et al 2010 cramer et al 2008 the size of the natural patches is also important as larger patches foster more species and are more resilient to abiotic fluctuations mitchell et al 2013 2015 hence the recovery process depends both on the area of natural patches and on the size of their border with degraded land we propose a spontaneous recovery term that scales both with natural land area n and with degraded land s border d mitchell et al 2015 the propagation of degraded land s occurs throguh a symmetric mechanism where the potential for degradation grows with degraded land area and with the natural land s border therefore the equation for the change in natural land is 5 d n d τ r n d recovery d β d n degradation k 0 k k 0 1 β c p n conversion the parameters r and dβ are the recovery and degradation rates respectively the degradation rate scales linearly with the agricultural intensification such that more intensive agricultural land is more heavily degraded furthermore heavily degraded land contributes to a greater extent to the degradation of natural land 2 6 nondimensionalization we rescale the dynamical

pristine landscape sustainable vs unsustainable land use strategies we first look at the dynamics that follow the introduction of a small population in a pristine landscape the time series are depicted in fig 3 no matter the land use strategy the early transient dynamics are identical the human population converts the natural land into agricultural fields thus increasing resource production which positively feeds back on the human population the increased population in turn accelerates land conversion this positive feedback loop causes a population explosion accompanied by a transformation of the landscape agricultural land expansion fuels an increase in degraded land both land conversion and increasing amounts of degraded land contribute to the decline of natural land the decrease in natural land area ultimately causes a deceleration of agricultural expansion until no more land is converted the human population peaks with the agricultural area degraded land cannot be converted back to agricultural land this introduces a time delayed feedback as the stock of natural land is not instantaneously regenerated the time delayed feedback causes the population to overshoot its carrying capacity after the overshoot the socio ecological system can reach two different equilibria depending on the land use strategy β we call viable equilibrium the one where the human population exists in the long term and collapse equilibrium the one where the population goes extinct in the viable equilibrium the human population exists within a complex landscape composed of a natural agricultural and degraded land mosaic in contrast the landscape in the collapse equilibrium is fully degraded without agriculture there is no resource production and the human population cannot be maintained the land use strategy spectrum can be divided into three regions according to the system s asymptotic behaviour as a function of the strategy β the first region corresponds to values of β between 0 and the transition to the collapse equilibrium at the critical point β β c 1 we call this region the sharing side of the spectrum as land use strategies in that range mimic land sharing kinds of strategy e g low intensity agriculture over large areas the collapse range referred to as δβ later in the text refers to the region of the spectrum where strategies lead to the collapse equilibrium when land use strategies are inside the collapse range the degraded land propagates into the whole landscape leading to a population collapse the region between the collapse range and the viable equilibrium is designated the sparing side of the spectrum as the strategies in this region mimic land sparing kind of strategies e g high intensity agriculture over small areas 3 2 on the path to socio ecological collapse the existence of the collapse range is due to changes in the stability of the viable equilibrium as a function of the agricultural land use strategy β on the sharing side of the spectrum the viable equilibrium is a stable focus node hence in the phase space trajectories follow spirals before reaching the fixed point fig 4 a which translate into damped oscillations over time column a of fig 5 as land use strategies come closer to the collapse range β increases the amplitude of the oscillations grow which delays the system s convergence to the viable equilibrium when the land use strategy enters the collapse range the viable equilibrium becomes a saddle focus and loses stability fig 4 b the stability loss is caused by a subcritical hopf bifurcation which leaves the collapse equilibrium as the sole stable attractor for the socio ecological system on the sparing side of the spectrum the transition to collapse has a different origin as for the sharing side of the spectrum the system converges to a viable equilibrium via damped oscillations fig 4 a which grow in amplitude as the collapse range is approached however in this case the system undergoes a supercritical hopf transition when the critical point is reached hence the stability loss of the viable equilibrium is accompanied by the birth of a stable limit cycle which allows the socio ecological system to potentially escape the collapse equilibrium fig 4 c and oscillate around the viable equilibrium however the amplitude of the oscillations grows as the land use strategy moves in the sharing direction β decreases eventually the oscillations become large enough to push the system through a tipping point provoking a socio ecological collapse bottom of column c in fig 5 analytically we can determine a threshold landscape composition after which socio ecological collapse is unavoidable analysis of the natural land s dynamical equation gives the following condition 9 n d d β r 2 where d 1 a n is the fraction of degraded land the threshold depends on the land recovery potential r as well as on the degradation potential d β the threshold represents the point at which the landscape is so deteriorated that the remaining fraction of natural land is not sufficient to recover the degraded land nor to maintain its natural state hence degraded land starts propagating into the natural land resulting in the complete degradation of the landscape and population extinction close to the second transition to collapse oscillations approach the previous threshold column d of fig 5 a small change in the land use strategy increases the oscillations amplitude and pushes the system through the tipping point driving it to collapse column c of fig 5 3 3 role of land recovery potential on the size of the collapse range the size of the collapse range δ β β c 2 β c 1 is highly dependent on the degraded land s recovery potential r as figs 6 and 7 show as the land recovery potential increases the size of the collapse range decreases until it disappears it is interesting to note that on the sharing side of the spectrum when β β c 1 an increase in β leads to higher agricultural yields and larger populations however the decrease in the land conversion effort is not high enough to prevent the fraction of natural land to decrease indeed agricultural intensification increases the natural land s degradation rate βd increasing the potential of degraded land to propagate into the rest of the landscape when agricultural intensification is not accompanied by a sufficiently large reduction in the conversion effort the system enters the path to collapse at the critical point the levels of degradation are sufficiently high to cause a socio ecological collapse on the sparing side of the spectrum when β β c 2 the decrease in the land conversion effort that accompanies the increase of intensification succeeds in sparing natural land and allows larger populations to exist in a landscape with a higher fraction of natural area at the extreme of the sparing strategy spectrum populations decrease when β rises this is due to the decrease in the land conversion effort only a small fraction of land is converted to agriculture and as such a much lower population can be sustained with the same consumption level we investigated in more detail the relationship between the size of the critical region δβ and the landscape intrinsic parameters r and d fig 7 the controur plots of fig 7 show the variation of the critical values β c 1 and β c 2 as a function of r and d for a given natural land degradation rate d increasing the recovery rate of degraded land r rises β c 1 and diminishes β c 2 when the difference between the two critical values reaches 0 the collapse range ceases to exist black region in contour plots of fig 7 the non linearity of the edge between the coloured δβ 0 and black regions δ β 0 of the contour plots shows that the collapse frontier is more sensitive to r than d such that when an increase in degradation requires a smaller increase in r to off set the increase in degradation 3 4 the dangers of naive agricultural land use planning as it is formulated our model does not allow us to know how much the land conversion effort should diminish for a given increase in agricultural intensification in order to avoid socio ecological collapse this is because we fixed a linear trade off between the conversion effort and the intensity in reality the relationship between them can be highly nonlinear in order to address the question we release the linear trade off assumption and let the land conversion effort to be independent of agricultural intensity we then explore land use strategies along the two dimensions of intensification and extensification in practice this means we now have two parameters k land conversion effort and β agricultural intensity to describe a land use strategy instead of a single one hence the equations for land become 10 d a d t k p n e β a d n d t r n 1 a n d β 1 a n n k p n in fig 8 we plot the regions of the land use strategy space defined by the land conversion effort k and the agricultural intensity β where either the collapse equilibrium or the viable equilibrium are attained the border between the two regions is concave rather than linear which explains the existence of the collapse range δβ we previously described a linear decrease in the conversion effort in relation to agricultural intensity solid black line in the graph makes it unavoidable to cross the border between the viable and collapse equilibria this result shows the non triviality of designing sustainable land use strategies 4 discussion we investigated the impact of different land use strategies on the long term sustainability of an agriculturally based human society we considered agricultural land use planning along two strategical dimensions expansion and intensification inspired by the land sparing sharing debate we introduced in our model a land use strategy parameter β that controls the trade off between agricultural intensity and land conversion effort thus reducing the two dimensions of the strategy to a single parameter we then studied the behaviour of the coupled socio ecological system across a continuum of strategies ranging from low agricultural intensity and high conversion effort β 0 to high agricultural intensity and low conversion effort β 1 we find that agricultural intensification leads to irreversible land degradation and population collapse when not accompanied by a strong reduction of the land conversion effort furthermore the relationship between agricultural intensification and conversion effort is not straightforward uninformed land use planning can drive the socio ecological system to a critical transition that undermines sustainability and leads to irreversible collapse our model predicts that the most suitable strategy to ally a large population and nature conservation is to practice extremely intense agriculture and minimise the conversion of natural land to agriculture alternatively low agricultural intensification and high conversion efforts i e extensive agriculture lead to preserved landscapes but with significantly lower population sizes therefore for our current population the model seems to support the advocates of the sparing hypothesis however the existence of a collapse region in the middle of the strategy spectrum suggests that it is not simply a question of sparing gradual increases in intensification eventually cause the adoption of land use strategies within the collapse region of our model therefore if technological development in the agriculture sector stagnates there is a greater risk of getting trapped in the collapse region furthermore technology is not a panacea for all socio ecological issues as technology can lead to greater environmental degradation through what is known as the jevons paradox alcott et al 2012 with reference to this paradox increasing agricultural production efficiency has the potential to increase demand which ultimately degrades more land and drives the system towards collapse socio ecological collapse can be avoided in the model by changing land use strategies quickly whether the levels of intensification required to overcome the collapse region are attainable or how to accurately measure intensity to know where we are on the spectrum are unclear it is evident that simultaneous increases in both agricultural expansion and intensification cannot be viable in the long term however current practices favour both intensification and expansion the last century s green revolution is a recent and striking example of how agricultural intensification can increase yields and food security however this was also the period of fastest population growth in history which further increased demand and motivated agricultural intensification and expansion the societal and economic benefits of agricultural intensification that ensure food security are undeniable however agricultural intensification and expansion have caused several environmental problems such as soil erosion nutrient runoff water pollution or habitat destruction and fragmentation it has also caused profound societal transformations in particular the disappearance of small agricultural producers that fuel urbanisation and change consumption patterns agricultural intensification is considered a plausible explanation of past societal collapses such as in the roman or mayan examples diamond 2005 population collapse emerges from our model as a consequence of large scale land degradation which impairs agricultural production in two ways first the deterioration of the landscape critically depletes the stock of natural land which is the primary source for conversion to agriculture second natural land depletion reduces the provision of ecosystem services to existing agricultural areas since land degradation can critically decrease agricultural production it seems ironic that agricultural land use is nowadays considered to be among the major causes of land degradation this dangerous feedback loop poses a serious threat to sustainability as agricultural expansion and or intensification to cope with reduced production can further reduce production in the long term by accentuating land degradation thus we stress the major importance that agricultural land use planning has on the sustainability of socio ecological systems furthermore our results also highlight the importance of socio ecologically informed agricultural land use policies to achieve sustainability by removing the trade off between land conversion and agricultural intensity in our model we showed that sustainable land use strategies can be obtained for the entire spectrum of intensification we consider however the frontier between unsustainable and sustainable land use is far from trivial the existence of unsustainable land use strategies comes from a bad evaluation of the needed reduction of land conversion for a given increase on intensification as our model is a simplification of real population dynamics and land use planning we do not claim that the frontier between sustainable and collapse paths is as we describe however we show that it is very likely for this frontier to be far from trivial hence making it easy for uninformed land use planning to fail much the same way that science based policies are considered crucial for climate change mitigation or human population sustainability motesharrei et al 2016 our work stresses the need to incorporate informed agricultural land use planning into the policy agenda to achieve sustainability globally at an aggregated scale it could be argued that we have not yet reached a critical point or planetary boundary steffen et al 2015 however at a local scale this might not be true agricultural land use is not spatially homogeneous and agricultural production is often strongly localised the pampas in south america and the great plains in the united states are two examples moreover these major agricultural regions are mostly expansive and intensive monocultures hence at a regional scale there is neither sparing nor sharing rather extensive exploitation which makes the landscape highly susceptible to irreversible ecological degradation in south american grasslands and forests these practices have already caused major environmental degradation fearnside 2001 guerschman and paruelo 2005 pengue 2005 in addition to societal problems pengue 2005 agricultural expansion has already destroyed most of brazil s atlantic forest centre for applied biodiversity science 2003 ribeiro et al 2011 and now it is advancing over the amazon forest one of the world s biodiversity hotspots davidson et al 2012 lovejoy and nobre 2018 nepstad et al 2008 soares filho et al 2006 the variations in land management practices highlight the interest of considering a continuous range of both agricultural expansion and intensification rather than discrete levels of intensity roman et al 2018 in modelling studies the possibility of local collapses poses a threat to global sustainability as it is unclear how these local collapses can propagate over the world via environmental degradation but also via changes in trade or migration networks our model is a simplified representation of agricultural practices human demography and social structure which allows us to explore a range of scenarios and understand the behaviours within the model but it also omits details of our complex society for example it does not account for social and economic inequalities which have been recognized as important drivers of socio ecological dynamics motesharrei et al 2016 social and economic inequalities push the system away from a sustainable human nature equilibrium cumming and von cramon taubadel 2018 thus would likely have a amplifying effect on the results additionally the logistic model we use to describe human population dynamics is heuristic and does not reflect the actual mechanisms responsible for variations in human fertility and mortality mote et al 2020 lastly we have assumed that humans cannot adapt to environmental degradation by changing land use strategies or fertility and consumption behaviours over time this is a major limitation as adaptive strategies could potentially prevent the predicted population collapse however these simplifications do not reduce the pertinence of our results as the current trends have the potential to cause a collapse if habits go unchanged moreover if humans succeed through changes in cultural patterns to avoid a drastic population reduction it is very likely that the changes will be dramatic and involve for example a complete socio economical restructuring cumming and peterson 2017 hence our results highlight that our current socio ecological system might be heading towards dramatic changes even though it is hard to predict the form they will take 5 conclusions by exploring a continuum of land use strategies our work differentiates from previous models of coupled human land dynamics and shows the importance of quantifying agricultural expansion and intensification levels to assess sustainable land use strategies we modelled agricultural land use planning along two dimensions expansion given by the population s conversion effort and intensification expansion and intensification can act in synergy to increase landscape degradation but there are also trade offs between them agricultural expansion increases the stock of potential degraded land while agricultural intensification can both speed and deepen agricultural land s degradation our results show how increasing agricultural intensification leads to socio ecological collapse when there is an insufficient reduction of the land conversion effort agricultural intensification increases agricultural production hence human population size if consumption levels are kept equal population growth feeds back on the landscape s composition by further accelerating land conversion eventually land degradation reduces resource production and causes the population to overshoot its carrying capacity and ultimately decline it could be argued that technological development has the potential to stave off collapse however the impact of new technologies on the environment is ambiguous technology has the potential to increase production efficiency but could also further decouple food production from nature by replacing ecosystem services with synthetic inputs the cure all technology argument neglects feedbacks between technology and human behaviour as well as its underlying dependence on the environment future work will put a greater focus on the links between changes in technology and behaviour and its impact on socio ecological dynamics our model illustrates a potential mechanism that may explain the decline of past societies but also a possible future collapse as the global human population is projected to keep growing in the coming decades adapted agriculture management will become more important and reduce the potential risks of future socio ecological collapse our model points to agriculture intensification as a possible solution however it is imperative that this is not in combination with expansion however we also stress that determining the limits to agricultural expansion that are necessary to achieve sustainability is not a trivial task hence precautionary land use planning should be accompanied by changes in social norms such as a reduction of consumption to increase the likelihood of a sustainable future by modelling the bi directional feedbacks between human demography and land use we have shown how misguided or uninformed agricultural land use planning can lead a socio ecological system to collapse this stresses the importance of informed land use planning to achieve sustainability through evidence based policy design humans have the tools to modify precarious land use

24732,agricultural land expansion and intensification driven by human consumption of agricultural goods are among the major threats to environmental degradation and biodiversity conservation land degradation can ultimately hamper agricultural production through a decrease in ecosystem services thus designing viable land use policies is a key sustainability challenge we develop a model describing the coupled dynamics of human demography and landscape composition while imposing a trade off between agricultural expansion and intensification we model land use strategies spanning from low intensity agriculture and high land conversion rates per person to high intensity agriculture and low land conversion rates per person and explore their consequences on the long term dynamics of the coupled human land system we seek to characterise the strategies viability in the long run and understand the mechanisms that potentially lead to large scale land degradation and population collapse due to resource scarcity we show that the viability of land use strategies strongly depends on the land s intrinsic recovery rate we also find that socio ecological collapses occur when agricultural intensification is not accompanied by a sufficient decrease in land conversion based on these findings we stress the dangers of uninformed land use planning and the importance of precautionary behaviour for land use management and land use policy design keywords socio ecological modelling land use planning agricultural intensification agricultural expansion socio ecological collapse policies for sustainability 1 introduction food production is the most basic and tangible example of humans dependence on nature from paleolithic hunter gatherers who relied on direct harvest from nature to contemporary complex societies that rely on agriculture and livestock human survival ultimately depends on what the land provides an ever growing population and demand for food are putting unprecedented pressure on the environment tscharntke et al 2012 increased food consumption necessitates agriculture expansion however the last ipbes report bongaarts 2019 highlights the role of agricultural land expansion as the main threat to biodiversity loss mediated by the fragmentation and degradation of habitats corvalán et al 2005 jacobson et al 2019 nowosad and stepinski 2019 degradation of the natural environment brings societal and economic consequences for human populations as it can result in decreasing agricultural yields mitchell et al 2014 and public health issues power 2010 conservation of biodiversity and natural spaces are often considered secondary objectives when compared to food security but biodiversity and ecosystem services play an integral role in maintaining food supply agricultural productivity is strongly dependent on ecosystem services such as pollination nutrient cycling and pest control that surrounding natural spaces provide mitchell et al 2013 therefore conservation goals should not be seen as opposed to agricultural production or human well being as natural land is essential to provisioning services braat and de groot 2012 cazalis et al 2018 allying natural and agricultural lands is the key to achieve sustainability and avoid a potential socio ecological collapse the introduction of agriculture permitted the apparition of the first permanent human settlements however neolithic settlements quickly became heavily reliant on the agricultural system and as a result when environmental disasters struck the food supply and the population suffered downey et al 2016 in some cases as much as 60 of the population was lost due to failed crops over time technological developments made it possible for human societies to adopt more intense forms of agriculture which increased resource production and food security agricultural production enabled the population to grow and allowed the development of complex societies via social differentiation and territorial expansion kuijt and goring morris 2002 this drive to increase agricultural production however led to deforestation defries et al 2010 excessive freshwater use lilienfeld and asmild 2007 soil biodiversity loss tsiafouli et al 2015 altered nutrient quinton et al 2010 and water cycles davidson et al 2012 decreased pollinator abundance and increased vulnerability to environmental change all of which can have deleterious effects on agricultural production agriculture is thus dependent on the natural environment but it also heavily transforms this environment the aim of future societies is to have agriculture improve social welfare but how to achieve this while limiting environmental degradation is a major unknown agriculture has been responsible for both the rise and fall of societies historical examples of societal collapse are geographically diverse and have occurred over various time scales cumming and peterson 2017 several social political and economical mechanisms have been proposed to explain such collapses tainter 1988 however for a number of them the roots of societal decline can be traced back to ecological problems caused by resource over exploitation and poor agricultural land management the mayan and the anasazi collapses are two classic examples in both cases collapse is thought to have resulted from feedbacks between population growth and agricultural expansion and intensification which led to greater environmental degradation and made the food production system unviable cumming and peterson 2017 diamond 2005 roman et al 2018 food scarcity sows the seeds of economic trouble social unease and political instability which trap societies in positive feedback loop leading to collapse the current environmental crisis has reignited scientific interest in societal collapse there is a general agreement that overpopulation and overconsumption are the main threats to environmental conservation and sustainability barrett et al 2020 thus recent studies have addressed sustainability questions by explicitly considering human demography and consumption behaviour in particular modelling approaches have shown great potential to shed light on sustainability challenges as they allow the exploration of different scenarios that would be impossible to reproduce experimentally in a recent study motesharrei et al 2014 used a dynamical model to show how social inequalities in terms of resource consumption and contribution to labour can undermine sustainability and cause societal collapses this finding can be linked to other issues such as population growth kentor 2001 and over consumption ceballos et al 2017 which contribute to environmental degradation and social instability more recently henderson and loreau 2018 and henderson and loreau 2019 proposed a general theoretical framework to explain human demography across history in relation to resource accessibility which can be used to explain the population explosion in the last century and potential future scenarios broadening the spectrum of possible connections between nature and human populations cazalis et al 2018 built a model to explore socio ecological dynamics through the dependence of humans on several ecosystem services through an economic ecological model lafuite et al 2017 2018 lafuite and loreau 2017 investigated how time lags in the response of biodiversity to anthropic perturbations can feedback on the human population via shortages in food production and undermine the sustainability of the socio ecological system these studies provide the basis for our work showing a link between humans and the environment through food consumption which we represent by feedbacks between human population growth and agricultural land use research on sustainable agricultural land use has led to the land sharing sparing debate grau et al 2013 power 2010 whether it is better to protect larger areas of natural land and cultivate high intensity fields on the remaining land or protect smaller areas of natural land while practicing wild life friendly low intensity agriculture is a question that has not yet been fully answered different authors often arrive at different conclusions some defending the sparing intensification paradigm balmford et al 2019 phalan et al 2011a 2011b and others the sharing or agroecological one perfecto and vandermeer 2010 power 2010 the sparing sharing debate has been criticized for omitting the coupling between land use and human demography phalan 2018 furthermore the discussion generally examines discrete opposing strategies yet there is an entire spectrum between these two extremes the impact of agricultural intensification on sustainability is an important issue at present as in the developing countries foreign demand is fueling the conversion of large areas of natural land into intensively cultivated monocultures fearnside 2001 pengue 2005 reboratti 2010 soares filho et al 2006 the result is a uniform landscape that is highly vulnerable to environmental fluctuations destruction of natural habitats fragmentation contamination of underground water sources and nutrient runoff these practices are detrimental to the environment but agriculture is necessary to feed the population it is obvious that a balance needs to be achieved between food production and natural land conservation as the actions taken today could jeopardize the population s viability in the long run here we build a model to explore the effects of different agricultural land use strategies on long term human environment dynamics through a simple and tractable model accounting for the interaction between human demography and land dynamics we study the viability of agricultural socio ecological systems under different land use strategies along an intensification expansion spectrum we introduce a trade off between intensification and the land conversion effort and investigate for which land use strategies the population collapses due to land degradation our central premise is that increasing agricultural production can promote further population growth thus agricultural intensification via increasing agricultural yields can have a positive feedback on human demography initiating the need for larger production and therefore causing further natural land conversion to agriculture which eventually leads to a more degraded landscape we test the conditions under which increasing agricultural intensification fails to spare enough natural land and promotes unsustainable population growth pushing the environment through a tipping point and ultimately leading the social ecological system to collapse 2 model description 2 1 bidirectional coupling between human demography and land dynamics our model considers the conversion of natural land to agricultural land in relation to the demand from the human population as population dynamics are driven by the resources humans can access and consume they ultimately depend on the landscape s composition resource production depends on the landscape composition but also on agricultural intensity we conceive agricultural land use along two dimensions the conversion effort which controls the spatial extension of agricultural land and agricultural intensity in the model humans adopt a land use strategy ranging from low intensity and high land conversion rates to high intensity and low land conversion rates this negative relation between agricultural intensity and the land conversion effort is grounded in the land sparing sharing debate highly expansive and intense agricultural land uses have been identified as unsustainable hence the debate is whether the focus to achieve sustainability should be put on increasing intensification to reduce the converted areas or extensification to have a wildlife friendly agricultural landscape we aim to reproduce these two strategic poles by imposing a trade off between agricultural intensity and land conversion effort hence reducing the two strategical dimensions to a single parameter in this study we do not consider the evolution of the strategy over time and assume it remains constant agricultural land is exhausted and degraded at different rates depending on the surrounding landscape and ultimately becomes unproductive cramer et al 2008 henderson and loreau 2019 natural land contributes to the recovery of surrounding land acting for example as a species pool necessary for recolonization by native species baeten et al 2010 cramer et al 2008 hence fragmentation of natural areas and degradation of natural patches surrounding degraded land can obstruct its spontaneous recovery on the other hand natural land can also become degraded indeed a degraded state of land can propagate into a natural one as is the case with a desertification front that propagates on semi arid landscapes zelnik and meron 2018 zelnik et al 2017 the balance between the recovery and degradation processes depends not only on the extension of both natural and degraded land but also on the borders between the two types of lands and on the level of degradation cramer et al 2008 2 2 human demography a number of studies have discussed the idea of a human carrying capacity and pointed to food supply as one of the main constraints to human population growth cohen 1995 fanta et al 2018 hopfenberg 2003 in this study we follow the same reasoning and assume human population size p follows logistic growth with a carrying capacity that evolves over time subject to changes in food supply the use of the logistic equation to describe the dynamics of human populations has been previously criticized board on environmental change and society et al 2014 mote et al 2020 and other studies have opted to explicitly model fertility and mortality processes by various functions related to consumption levels henderson and loreau 2019 lafuite and loreau 2017 motesharrei et al 2014 furthermore cohen 1995 has stressed the difficulties of estimating a human carrying capacity given that several bio physical and social mechanisms that might constrain human population growth are dynamically evolving and possibly unidentified however historical population trends have been well recovered by logistic models using food dependent carrying capacities fanta et al 2018 goldberg et al 2016 additionally the unprecedented population increase of the 1960s to 2000s was also modelled using a logistic model where hopfenberg 2003 quantified the human carrying capacity using food production showing good agreement with empirical data more recently suweis et al 2013 used the link between water availability and food production to calculate a human carrying capacity based on access to water resources using population data from 1970 to 2011 we assume the human carrying capacity to be the ratio between total resource production and per capita consumption k p y c where y is total resource production depending on the landscape s composition and c is per capita resource consumption as such the carrying capacity endogenously changes over time as food production changes driven by the feedbacks between humans and the landscape for a given consumption intensity the maximum number of humans that can be sustained is then given by the ratio of production over per capita consumption 1 d p d τ r 0 p 1 p k p r 0 p 1 c p y where r 0 is the population s growth rate at very low densities we assume that r 0 and c remain constant over time this is a simplification as it is known that technological developments and cultural evolution have driven changes in human fertility and consumption as well as in agricultural productivity which inevitably impact the human carrying capacity however in this study we do not consider the role of cultural and technological evolution instead we focus on the land dynamics based on a previous model of socio ecological interactions that included variations in food production efficiency cazalis et al 2018 the inclusion of technology in the carrying capacity would likely shift the onset of collapse vary the size of the collapse range and alter the viability range of parameters but would not change the overall or long term trends 2 3 agricultural production the number of resources produced y depends on the area of agricultural land a but also on that of natural n and degraded d land as well as on agricultural intensity β noncultivated land whether natural or degraded provides ecosystem services that are crucial for agricultural production such as pollination nutrient cycling pest control and water quality regulation mitchell et al 2014 however greater land degradation leads to fewer and lower quality ecosystem services therefore we do not consider natural and degraded land to contribute equally to agricultural production instead we introduce an effective land function ϵ l n d β which represents the effective area of non cultivated land that provides ecosystem services to agricultural land 2 ϵ l n 1 β d the contribution of degraded land to effective land decreases with its level of deterioration which in turn depends on the level of agricultural intensification β we assume that more intensive agriculture results in higher degrees of land degradation and as such intensive agriculture transitions to highly degraded land for simplicity the contribution of degraded land to effective land decreases linearly with agricultural intensity we model agricultural resource production y as the sum of the contributions from the total cultivated area area contribution and from the border of agricultural land with non cultivated land both natural and degraded represented by the effective land ϵ l border contribution therefore the area contribution scales with agricultural land area and the border contribution with the square root of agricultural land area furthermore we assume the relative weights of area and border contributions in production depend on agricultural intensity β as agricultural intensification grows production y becomes less dependent on the ecosystem services provided by the surrounding non agricultural land and more dependent on human inputs hence increasing intensification diminishes the border contribution and increases the area contribution on production therefore we assume the area contribution increases linearly with agricultural intensity β while the border contribution decreases linearly with β the amplitude of the area and border contributions is modulated by the functions ya β and yb β these two functions can be interpreted as the characteristic productivity of the area and border contributions respectively for a given agricultural intensity β ya β is the production per unit area of agricultural land and yb β is the production per unit area of effective land per unit length of the agricultural land s border 3 y y a β β a area contribution y b β 1 β ϵ l a border contribution y a β β a q ϵ l 1 β a agricultural intensity β ranges from 0 to 1 0 being extreme low intensity agriculture and 1 extreme high intensity as intensification increases agricultural yields we model the characteristic productivity of the area ya and border yb contributions as increasing functions of agricultural intensification for simplicity we assume a linear dependency i e y a β y a β and y b β y b β the parameters ya and yb are then the productivities per unit of intensification we introduce the parameter q y b y a which represents the relative importance of the border and area contribution to resource production fig 2 shows the magnitude of agricultural resource production as a function of landscape composition when β is close to 0 maximum production is obtained in a landscape where about a third of the land is agricultural the food production is exclusively dependent on the services provided by the non anthropogenic landscape as we assume the services that non cultivated land provides to agricultural land depend both on the area and quality of non cultivated land and on the length of the border between them at this extreme of the spectrum production scales with the square root of agricultural area at the extreme the fraction of natural land is not important because the degradation caused by the agricultural activity is extremely low such that natural and degraded land contribute equally to effective land as β grows the fraction of natural land starts to have an impact as degraded and natural land are not interchangeable anymore when β approaches 1 production becomes exclusively dependent on agricultural land area this is a scenario of extremely high agricultural intensity where agricultural yields become independent of the services provided by the non agricultural landscape and rely exclusively on human inputs such as fertilizers or pesticides in the high intensity case production is proportional to the area of agricultural land fig 2 also shows that yields increase with intensification as maximum attainable production yellow areas in the figure grows with β 2 4 land dynamics agricultural land equation land conversion is driven by the human population s demand for agricultural goods which results on the conversion of natural land to agriculture we assume that demand is equal to the total desired food consumption cp since we aim to investigate the impact of different land use strategies along the intensification extensification spectrum on human land dynamics we impose a trade off between agricultural intensity and land conversion rate we model land conversion rate as a decreasing affine function of agricultural intensity β nutrient runoff and soil erosion cause agricultural land degradation which increases with intensity therefore we model the degradation rate of agricultural land as a linear function of β capturing the fact that high intensity agriculture degrades the land faster than does low intensity agriculture the dynamical equation for the agricultural land area is given by 4 d a d τ k 0 k k 0 1 β c p n conversion e β a degradation parameters k 0 and k are the minimum and maximum conversion rates per unit of demanded resources cp respectively as the demand for resources is proportional to population density k 0 and k are also per capita rates of conversion therefore in the following we will call them per capita conversion rates in the extreme high intensity scenario β 1 the conversion rate per person is at its minimum k 0 in the extreme low intensity scenario β 0 the conversion rate per person is at its maximum k 2 5 land dynamics natural land equation apart from being converted to agriculture natural land area can either increase through the spontaneous recovery of degraded land or decrease by the propagation of the degraded state of land the natural land at the edges of degraded land fosters its spontaneous recovery through both biotic and abiotic processes it acts as a species pool promoting native species recolonization or as a source of good quality water or chemical compounds to restore soil chemistry baeten et al 2010 cramer et al 2008 the size of the natural patches is also important as larger patches foster more species and are more resilient to abiotic fluctuations mitchell et al 2013 2015 hence the recovery process depends both on the area of natural patches and on the size of their border with degraded land we propose a spontaneous recovery term that scales both with natural land area n and with degraded land s border d mitchell et al 2015 the propagation of degraded land s occurs throguh a symmetric mechanism where the potential for degradation grows with degraded land area and with the natural land s border therefore the equation for the change in natural land is 5 d n d τ r n d recovery d β d n degradation k 0 k k 0 1 β c p n conversion the parameters r and dβ are the recovery and degradation rates respectively the degradation rate scales linearly with the agricultural intensification such that more intensive agricultural land is more heavily degraded furthermore heavily degraded land contributes to a greater extent to the degradation of natural land 2 6 nondimensionalization we rescale the dynamical

pristine landscape sustainable vs unsustainable land use strategies we first look at the dynamics that follow the introduction of a small population in a pristine landscape the time series are depicted in fig 3 no matter the land use strategy the early transient dynamics are identical the human population converts the natural land into agricultural fields thus increasing resource production which positively feeds back on the human population the increased population in turn accelerates land conversion this positive feedback loop causes a population explosion accompanied by a transformation of the landscape agricultural land expansion fuels an increase in degraded land both land conversion and increasing amounts of degraded land contribute to the decline of natural land the decrease in natural land area ultimately causes a deceleration of agricultural expansion until no more land is converted the human population peaks with the agricultural area degraded land cannot be converted back to agricultural land this introduces a time delayed feedback as the stock of natural land is not instantaneously regenerated the time delayed feedback causes the population to overshoot its carrying capacity after the overshoot the socio ecological system can reach two different equilibria depending on the land use strategy β we call viable equilibrium the one where the human population exists in the long term and collapse equilibrium the one where the population goes extinct in the viable equilibrium the human population exists within a complex landscape composed of a natural agricultural and degraded land mosaic in contrast the landscape in the collapse equilibrium is fully degraded without agriculture there is no resource production and the human population cannot be maintained the land use strategy spectrum can be divided into three regions according to the system s asymptotic behaviour as a function of the strategy β the first region corresponds to values of β between 0 and the transition to the collapse equilibrium at the critical point β β c 1 we call this region the sharing side of the spectrum as land use strategies in that range mimic land sharing kinds of strategy e g low intensity agriculture over large areas the collapse range referred to as δβ later in the text refers to the region of the spectrum where strategies lead to the collapse equilibrium when land use strategies are inside the collapse range the degraded land propagates into the whole landscape leading to a population collapse the region between the collapse range and the viable equilibrium is designated the sparing side of the spectrum as the strategies in this region mimic land sparing kind of strategies e g high intensity agriculture over small areas 3 2 on the path to socio ecological collapse the existence of the collapse range is due to changes in the stability of the viable equilibrium as a function of the agricultural land use strategy β on the sharing side of the spectrum the viable equilibrium is a stable focus node hence in the phase space trajectories follow spirals before reaching the fixed point fig 4 a which translate into damped oscillations over time column a of fig 5 as land use strategies come closer to the collapse range β increases the amplitude of the oscillations grow which delays the system s convergence to the viable equilibrium when the land use strategy enters the collapse range the viable equilibrium becomes a saddle focus and loses stability fig 4 b the stability loss is caused by a subcritical hopf bifurcation which leaves the collapse equilibrium as the sole stable attractor for the socio ecological system on the sparing side of the spectrum the transition to collapse has a different origin as for the sharing side of the spectrum the system converges to a viable equilibrium via damped oscillations fig 4 a which grow in amplitude as the collapse range is approached however in this case the system undergoes a supercritical hopf transition when the critical point is reached hence the stability loss of the viable equilibrium is accompanied by the birth of a stable limit cycle which allows the socio ecological system to potentially escape the collapse equilibrium fig 4 c and oscillate around the viable equilibrium however the amplitude of the oscillations grows as the land use strategy moves in the sharing direction β decreases eventually the oscillations become large enough to push the system through a tipping point provoking a socio ecological collapse bottom of column c in fig 5 analytically we can determine a threshold landscape composition after which socio ecological collapse is unavoidable analysis of the natural land s dynamical equation gives the following condition 9 n d d β r 2 where d 1 a n is the fraction of degraded land the threshold depends on the land recovery potential r as well as on the degradation potential d β the threshold represents the point at which the landscape is so deteriorated that the remaining fraction of natural land is not sufficient to recover the degraded land nor to maintain its natural state hence degraded land starts propagating into the natural land resulting in the complete degradation of the landscape and population extinction close to the second transition to collapse oscillations approach the previous threshold column d of fig 5 a small change in the land use strategy increases the oscillations amplitude and pushes the system through the tipping point driving it to collapse column c of fig 5 3 3 role of land recovery potential on the size of the collapse range the size of the collapse range δ β β c 2 β c 1 is highly dependent on the degraded land s recovery potential r as figs 6 and 7 show as the land recovery potential increases the size of the collapse range decreases until it disappears it is interesting to note that on the sharing side of the spectrum when β β c 1 an increase in β leads to higher agricultural yields and larger populations however the decrease in the land conversion effort is not high enough to prevent the fraction of natural land to decrease indeed agricultural intensification increases the natural land s degradation rate βd increasing the potential of degraded land to propagate into the rest of the landscape when agricultural intensification is not accompanied by a sufficiently large reduction in the conversion effort the system enters the path to collapse at the critical point the levels of degradation are sufficiently high to cause a socio ecological collapse on the sparing side of the spectrum when β β c 2 the decrease in the land conversion effort that accompanies the increase of intensification succeeds in sparing natural land and allows larger populations to exist in a landscape with a higher fraction of natural area at the extreme of the sparing strategy spectrum populations decrease when β rises this is due to the decrease in the land conversion effort only a small fraction of land is converted to agriculture and as such a much lower population can be sustained with the same consumption level we investigated in more detail the relationship between the size of the critical region δβ and the landscape intrinsic parameters r and d fig 7 the controur plots of fig 7 show the variation of the critical values β c 1 and β c 2 as a function of r and d for a given natural land degradation rate d increasing the recovery rate of degraded land r rises β c 1 and diminishes β c 2 when the difference between the two critical values reaches 0 the collapse range ceases to exist black region in contour plots of fig 7 the non linearity of the edge between the coloured δβ 0 and black regions δ β 0 of the contour plots shows that the collapse frontier is more sensitive to r than d such that when an increase in degradation requires a smaller increase in r to off set the increase in degradation 3 4 the dangers of naive agricultural land use planning as it is formulated our model does not allow us to know how much the land conversion effort should diminish for a given increase in agricultural intensification in order to avoid socio ecological collapse this is because we fixed a linear trade off between the conversion effort and the intensity in reality the relationship between them can be highly nonlinear in order to address the question we release the linear trade off assumption and let the land conversion effort to be independent of agricultural intensity we then explore land use strategies along the two dimensions of intensification and extensification in practice this means we now have two parameters k land conversion effort and β agricultural intensity to describe a land use strategy instead of a single one hence the equations for land become 10 d a d t k p n e β a d n d t r n 1 a n d β 1 a n n k p n in fig 8 we plot the regions of the land use strategy space defined by the land conversion effort k and the agricultural intensity β where either the collapse equilibrium or the viable equilibrium are attained the border between the two regions is concave rather than linear which explains the existence of the collapse range δβ we previously described a linear decrease in the conversion effort in relation to agricultural intensity solid black line in the graph makes it unavoidable to cross the border between the viable and collapse equilibria this result shows the non triviality of designing sustainable land use strategies 4 discussion we investigated the impact of different land use strategies on the long term sustainability of an agriculturally based human society we considered agricultural land use planning along two strategical dimensions expansion and intensification inspired by the land sparing sharing debate we introduced in our model a land use strategy parameter β that controls the trade off between agricultural intensity and land conversion effort thus reducing the two dimensions of the strategy to a single parameter we then studied the behaviour of the coupled socio ecological system across a continuum of strategies ranging from low agricultural intensity and high conversion effort β 0 to high agricultural intensity and low conversion effort β 1 we find that agricultural intensification leads to irreversible land degradation and population collapse when not accompanied by a strong reduction of the land conversion effort furthermore the relationship between agricultural intensification and conversion effort is not straightforward uninformed land use planning can drive the socio ecological system to a critical transition that undermines sustainability and leads to irreversible collapse our model predicts that the most suitable strategy to ally a large population and nature conservation is to practice extremely intense agriculture and minimise the conversion of natural land to agriculture alternatively low agricultural intensification and high conversion efforts i e extensive agriculture lead to preserved landscapes but with significantly lower population sizes therefore for our current population the model seems to support the advocates of the sparing hypothesis however the existence of a collapse region in the middle of the strategy spectrum suggests that it is not simply a question of sparing gradual increases in intensification eventually cause the adoption of land use strategies within the collapse region of our model therefore if technological development in the agriculture sector stagnates there is a greater risk of getting trapped in the collapse region furthermore technology is not a panacea for all socio ecological issues as technology can lead to greater environmental degradation through what is known as the jevons paradox alcott et al 2012 with reference to this paradox increasing agricultural production efficiency has the potential to increase demand which ultimately degrades more land and drives the system towards collapse socio ecological collapse can be avoided in the model by changing land use strategies quickly whether the levels of intensification required to overcome the collapse region are attainable or how to accurately measure intensity to know where we are on the spectrum are unclear it is evident that simultaneous increases in both agricultural expansion and intensification cannot be viable in the long term however current practices favour both intensification and expansion the last century s green revolution is a recent and striking example of how agricultural intensification can increase yields and food security however this was also the period of fastest population growth in history which further increased demand and motivated agricultural intensification and expansion the societal and economic benefits of agricultural intensification that ensure food security are undeniable however agricultural intensification and expansion have caused several environmental problems such as soil erosion nutrient runoff water pollution or habitat destruction and fragmentation it has also caused profound societal transformations in particular the disappearance of small agricultural producers that fuel urbanisation and change consumption patterns agricultural intensification is considered a plausible explanation of past societal collapses such as in the roman or mayan examples diamond 2005 population collapse emerges from our model as a consequence of large scale land degradation which impairs agricultural production in two ways first the deterioration of the landscape critically depletes the stock of natural land which is the primary source for conversion to agriculture second natural land depletion reduces the provision of ecosystem services to existing agricultural areas since land degradation can critically decrease agricultural production it seems ironic that agricultural land use is nowadays considered to be among the major causes of land degradation this dangerous feedback loop poses a serious threat to sustainability as agricultural expansion and or intensification to cope with reduced production can further reduce production in the long term by accentuating land degradation thus we stress the major importance that agricultural land use planning has on the sustainability of socio ecological systems furthermore our results also highlight the importance of socio ecologically informed agricultural land use policies to achieve sustainability by removing the trade off between land conversion and agricultural intensity in our model we showed that sustainable land use strategies can be obtained for the entire spectrum of intensification we consider however the frontier between unsustainable and sustainable land use is far from trivial the existence of unsustainable land use strategies comes from a bad evaluation of the needed reduction of land conversion for a given increase on intensification as our model is a simplification of real population dynamics and land use planning we do not claim that the frontier between sustainable and collapse paths is as we describe however we show that it is very likely for this frontier to be far from trivial hence making it easy for uninformed land use planning to fail much the same way that science based policies are considered crucial for climate change mitigation or human population sustainability motesharrei et al 2016 our work stresses the need to incorporate informed agricultural land use planning into the policy agenda to achieve sustainability globally at an aggregated scale it could be argued that we have not yet reached a critical point or planetary boundary steffen et al 2015 however at a local scale this might not be true agricultural land use is not spatially homogeneous and agricultural production is often strongly localised the pampas in south america and the great plains in the united states are two examples moreover these major agricultural regions are mostly expansive and intensive monocultures hence at a regional scale there is neither sparing nor sharing rather extensive exploitation which makes the landscape highly susceptible to irreversible ecological degradation in south american grasslands and forests these practices have already caused major environmental degradation fearnside 2001 guerschman and paruelo 2005 pengue 2005 in addition to societal problems pengue 2005 agricultural expansion has already destroyed most of brazil s atlantic forest centre for applied biodiversity science 2003 ribeiro et al 2011 and now it is advancing over the amazon forest one of the world s biodiversity hotspots davidson et al 2012 lovejoy and nobre 2018 nepstad et al 2008 soares filho et al 2006 the variations in land management practices highlight the interest of considering a continuous range of both agricultural expansion and intensification rather than discrete levels of intensity roman et al 2018 in modelling studies the possibility of local collapses poses a threat to global sustainability as it is unclear how these local collapses can propagate over the world via environmental degradation but also via changes in trade or migration networks our model is a simplified representation of agricultural practices human demography and social structure which allows us to explore a range of scenarios and understand the behaviours within the model but it also omits details of our complex society for example it does not account for social and economic inequalities which have been recognized as important drivers of socio ecological dynamics motesharrei et al 2016 social and economic inequalities push the system away from a sustainable human nature equilibrium cumming and von cramon taubadel 2018 thus would likely have a amplifying effect on the results additionally the logistic model we use to describe human population dynamics is heuristic and does not reflect the actual mechanisms responsible for variations in human fertility and mortality mote et al 2020 lastly we have assumed that humans cannot adapt to environmental degradation by changing land use strategies or fertility and consumption behaviours over time this is a major limitation as adaptive strategies could potentially prevent the predicted population collapse however these simplifications do not reduce the pertinence of our results as the current trends have the potential to cause a collapse if habits go unchanged moreover if humans succeed through changes in cultural patterns to avoid a drastic population reduction it is very likely that the changes will be dramatic and involve for example a complete socio economical restructuring cumming and peterson 2017 hence our results highlight that our current socio ecological system might be heading towards dramatic changes even though it is hard to predict the form they will take 5 conclusions by exploring a continuum of land use strategies our work differentiates from previous models of coupled human land dynamics and shows the importance of quantifying agricultural expansion and intensification levels to assess sustainable land use strategies we modelled agricultural land use planning along two dimensions expansion given by the population s conversion effort and intensification expansion and intensification can act in synergy to increase landscape degradation but there are also trade offs between them agricultural expansion increases the stock of potential degraded land while agricultural intensification can both speed and deepen agricultural land s degradation our results show how increasing agricultural intensification leads to socio ecological collapse when there is an insufficient reduction of the land conversion effort agricultural intensification increases agricultural production hence human population size if consumption levels are kept equal population growth feeds back on the landscape s composition by further accelerating land conversion eventually land degradation reduces resource production and causes the population to overshoot its carrying capacity and ultimately decline it could be argued that technological development has the potential to stave off collapse however the impact of new technologies on the environment is ambiguous technology has the potential to increase production efficiency but could also further decouple food production from nature by replacing ecosystem services with synthetic inputs the cure all technology argument neglects feedbacks between technology and human behaviour as well as its underlying dependence on the environment future work will put a greater focus on the links between changes in technology and behaviour and its impact on socio ecological dynamics our model illustrates a potential mechanism that may explain the decline of past societies but also a possible future collapse as the global human population is projected to keep growing in the coming decades adapted agriculture management will become more important and reduce the potential risks of future socio ecological collapse our model points to agriculture intensification as a possible solution however it is imperative that this is not in combination with expansion however we also stress that determining the limits to agricultural expansion that are necessary to achieve sustainability is not a trivial task hence precautionary land use planning should be accompanied by changes in social norms such as a reduction of consumption to increase the likelihood of a sustainable future by modelling the bi directional feedbacks between human demography and land use we have shown how misguided or uninformed agricultural land use planning can lead a socio ecological system to collapse this stresses the importance of informed land use planning to achieve sustainability through evidence based policy design humans have the tools to modify precarious land use patterns and reduce the impact of agriculture on the environment setting our socio ecological system on a more sustainable path code accesibility all the open source software to reproduce our analysis

24733,correct modelling of relationships between predators and prey is crucial to ecological and population dynamics models however and despite a long standing competition between ratio and prey dependent models and a few alternative intermediate forms in the literature most equations currently used to represent such relationships do not meet theoretical criteria for biological consistency this research proposes a set of universally applicable criteria for all predation equations and shows that the most commonly used predation equations in the literature fail to meet these same criteria we follow with a proposal for a new predation equation that does meet these criteria which combines both prey and ratio dependent concepts while giving reasonable predictions in the cases of both high predator or high prey densities we show its empirical performance by applying the new equation along with existing alternatives to various experimental predation datasets from the literature results show that the new equation is not only more mathematically consistent than existing equations but also performs more consistently empirically across different datasets from various ecological situations this research is the first to propose a systematic set of criteria to evaluate predation equations and then to offer an equation that meets these criteria and also performs well both theoretically and empirically across datasets from a wide range of predation systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords prey dependence ratio dependence kovai equation density dependence functional response 1 introduction correctly representing the relationship between predators and prey is a key challenge to all attempts at modelling trophic interactions and population dynamics kratina et al 2009 a wide range of predation equations is currently available in the ecological literature to calculate predation rates prey consumed per predator per unit time based on an independent variable prey density predator density or both and one or more empirical parameters abrams and ginzburg 2000 these equations can be very generally classified according to the independent variable and the mathematical form functional response of the equation that links this variable to predation rates considering the independent variable predation equations are often divided into prey dependent where the prey population n is the only independent variable and ratio dependent equations where the ratio between prey and predator p populations n p is used as an independent variable a wide variety of intermediate forms have also been proposed of these we here mention some of the most commonly used the hassell varley forms hassell and varley 1969 and the beddington deangelis equation α n n c p b beddington 1975 deangelis et al 1975 the former represent a compromise between prey and ratio dependence where the n p prey predator ratio is replaced by n pm where m is a parameter in the range 0 1 that allows the function to transition smoothly between either prey or ratio dependence the beddington deangelis equation on the other hand incorporates both n and p but not in pure ratio form functional responses on the other hand are generally categorised as type i linearly increasing y α x type ii logarithmic type growth y α x x b type iii sigmoidal type growth y α x 2 x 2 b and type iv increasing to a peak followed by a decreasing response functional responses holling 1959 where xis the independent variable n in the case of prey dependence and n p in the case of ratio dependence type i rarely occurs with the notable exception of filter feeders jeschke et al 2004 type ii indicates predator saturation and type iii combines predator saturation at high prey densities with sigmoidal growth in predation at lower prey densities which could be caused by the saturation of limited prey refuges in the habitat or be indicative of preferential prey switching or learning by the predator type iv would occur in the case of dangerous prey líznarová and pekár 2013 where higher prey densities actually diminish the predator s capacity to feed some equations hassell varley prey dependent and ratio dependent forms can be combined with all response types while others such as beddington deangelis do not lend themselves to such modifications but intrinsically generate functional forms similar to one or more of the holling forms for a comprehensive in depth review of functional response equations the reader is referred to jeschke et al 2002 none of these equations however is completely satisfactory from a theoretical standpoint ratio dependence is unrealistic at low absolute prey densities when the physical scarcity of prey is likely to decrease predation rates as predators spend most of their time searching even if the predator population is itself very low and the prey predator ratio correspondingly high abrams and ginzburg 2000 ratio dependent equations also produce what have been described as unusual results namely infinite prey availability per predator as predator density declines towards 0 gleeson 1994 on the other hand prey dependence is unrealistic at low prey predator ratios when predators must necessarily divide available prey amongst themselves abrams and ginzburg 2000 and studies have found experimental data partially between ratio and prey dependence schenk et al 2005 there is therefore a need for an equation that encompasses both ratio and prey dependence processes while alternatives include equations of intermediate form partially between ratio and prey dependence their formulations as will be discussed later do not necessarily guarantee mathematically sound resolution of the different issues faced by each extreme for instance the transition between prey and ratio dependence in the hassell varley forms is dependent on a parameter not on prey or predator populations while the theoretical considerations mentioned in the preceding paragraph suggest that population levels are important in determining when either relationship is more appropriate switching between equations based on the nature of predator interference in the system has also been proposed skalski and gilliam 2001 there is therefore a need for clear criteria and expected behaviours for all useful predation equations which may promote a more standardised development of predation equations that are widely useful across various population densities and ratios such a list of criteria has been previously proposed by berryman et al 1995 but most relate to complete predator prey models and not to the predation function itself of the criteria that do apply are that predators must have finite appetites and that the potential for intraspecific competition should be included criteria which disqualify prey dependent equations however these criteria apply only to per predator feeding rates and do not include important conditions regarding total predation rates under extreme high or low prey or predator populations despite the long standing debate many of these issues have still not been satisfactorily resolved abrams 2015 and these equations are widely used in theoretical and practical research despite their previously identified shortcomings even prey dependence and type i functional responses which have been shown to be in most ecological systems generally inferior to other though imperfect alternatives abrams and ginzburg 2000 jeschke et al 2004 have been recently used as part of larger ecological and population dynamics models chesson and kuang 2008 sanchez et al 2018 sanders et al 2018 imbert et al 2020 these shortcomings occur because most of these equations are built upon assumptions mainly non extreme prey and predator population densities that are unlikely to hold true under natural conditions when applied to discrete time steps as they most often are in prediction modelling and in many field studies these are structural equation model errors which cannot be circumvented through parametrisation and calibration as such the predictions of these equations under extreme conditions such as those often seen in agriculture or other human managed systems may be invalid for instance equations whose assumptions do not hold under conditions of very high predator density gleeson 1994 abrams and ginzburg 2000 are unlikely to give correct predictions with regards to augmentative biocontrol efforts where large numbers of predators or parasitoids are released into the field this is a major impediment to the successful application of predator prey equations to ecological and especially agroecological modelling as kratina et al 2009 have observed choosing appropriate functional responses is crucial for adequate predictions of food web dynamics when ratio dependence is incorporated into predator prey models their stability is usually enhanced highlighting the importance of correct functional response equations to ecological model behaviour and reliability this paper addresses this gap in the literature by 1 proposing a standard set of criteria that all useful predation equations should observe when applied to discrete time steps 2 showing that the majority of equations available in the literature fail to meet one or several of these conditions and 3 proposing a new equation kovai equation for modelling predation rates that does meet these criteria the paper concludes with 4 a comparative evaluation of the performance of all reviewed equations by applying them to a range of predation datasets from the literature to demonstrate the practical improvements offered by the improved predation equation formulation this is the first research article to comprehensively address limitations in existing predation equations and to offer a mathematically sound improvement to these equations that performs well both theoretically and empirically 2 standard criteria for predation functions predation equations may be defined as the predation rate per predator per unit time f n p or as the total predation rate per unit time g n p p f n p where n and p are the prey and predator densities respectively the following sections present a proposed set of standard criteria for predation equations when applied to discrete time step simulations followed by a proposed equation that satisfies them in the following sections α denotes the maximum feeding rate for the predator or the amount of prey per unit time that an individual predator can consume if no time is wasted searching for prey as comparison commonly used equations from the literature were evaluated according to the same criteria including prey dependent ratio dependent and the intermediate hassell varley equation hassell and varley 1969 each combined with type i ii and iii holling functional response forms holling 1959 abrams and ginzburg 2000 three other equations which do not lend themselves to combination with distinct holling functional response forms the beddington deangelis equation beddington 1975 deangelis et al 1975 the crowley martin equation crowley and martin 1989 and the royama rogers equation royama 1971 rogers 1972 kfir 1983 were also tested see table 2 for a full definition of each equation 2 1 behaviour at high prey density as prey density increases predation per predator should at most asymptotically approach the maximum feeding rate for the predator in mathematical terms 0 lim n f n p α and by extension 0 lim n g n p α p 2 2 behaviour at low prey density as prey density approaches 0 both total as well as per predator predation should tend towards 0 that is lim n 0 f n p lim n 0 g n p 0 2 3 behaviour at high predator density as predator density increases overall predation should increase asymptotically towards the total prey population available or potentially to a lesser value the latter could be caused by the presence of some habitat niches that offer complete predation protection to a limited number of prey or else due to interference between predator individuals at the same time prey availability per predator should decrease as predators begin competing for prey in mathematical terms lim p g n p n though lim p f n p 0 2 4 behaviour at low predator density on the other hand as predator density decreases the total predation should also approach 0 lim p 0 g n p 0 while predation per predator may vary in no case should it be higher than the maximum feeding rate per predator that is 0 lim p 0 f n p α 2 5 other considerations finally many equations consider the functional response of predation rates to be dependent of a measure of prey abundance often prey density or else the prey predator ratio based on the assumption that predation rates are not a constant function of prey abundance and will instead likely change nonlinearly along with prey abundance for instance due to predator saturation or else to the existence of niches where a subpopulation of prey may be partially shielded from predation two of the three types type ii and type iii of functional response proposed by holling holling 1959 and widely used since were designed to model such effects however although one may reasonably expect that additional prey added to a system may be more vulnerable to predation than already present prey due for instance to the saturation of protected niches the addition of new prey should in no circumstance increase the instantaneous predation risk for prey that was already present in other words adding 1 unit of prey cannot increase total predation by more than 1 unit of prey or mathematically 0 d g d n 1 2 6 the kovai equation as can be later seen in table 2 most equations currently used for modelling predation fail in at least one of the above mentioned criteria we here describe a new equation which we propose to call by the name of the city where research leading to its development was conducted f n p α 1 e n u α p u 1 b n 1 e n b the first part of the kovai equation takes the ratio between predator and prey into account partitioning available prey amongst the predators present in this sense the kovai equation is similar to a ratio dependent equation but instead of using the raw prey density to calculate the prey predator ratio a measure of effective prey availability u is used that takes the scarcity of the prey and prey refuges into account and ranges between 0 and 1 this performs a similar purpose as the holling type iii functional response but retains the notable advantage that d d n u n 1 e n b which is in the range 0 1 for non negative b thereby ensuring that the effective prey availability will never increase faster than the prey density itself does bmay be interpreted as the maximum capacity of prey refuges lim n n n u lim n n n b 1 e n b b or alternatively as the prey density at which e 1 36 8 of the prey is accessible to the predator at low values of b the equation presents a functional response form similar to the holling type ii form allowing this parameter to control the functional response form of the equation in addition the fact that u is dependent on n and not on the ratio n p enables the kovai equation to account for prey scarcity in a similar manner to prey dependent equations 3 methods empirical study 12 experimental studies with predation functional response data were taken from the literature for a total of 29 distinct datasets table 1 where data was only available in the form of figures instead of tables these were first digitised using the web version of webplotdigitizer rohatgi 2019 all analyses were run in python 3 7 python software foundation psf 2019 using the libraries numpy van der walt et al 2011 pandas mckinney 2010 and pymc3 salvatier et al 2016 p 3 for mathematical analyses graphs were plotted using seaborn michael waskom et al 2018 and matplotlib hunter 2007 all data and code used to run the analyses and plot the figures present in this article are included in the supplementary material each of the equations in table 2 were calibrated using bayesian inference hamiltonian monte carlo no u turn sampler algorithm hoffman and gelman 2014 with each of the datasets using weakly informative priors in the case of experiments where prey densities were held constant theoretically infinite predation opportunities the functional response was modelled with a poisson distribution as follows y p o i s s o n μ n where y is the total number of predation events observed across all replicates n is the number of replicates and µ is calculated according to each equation s specification when as was most often the case prey were not replaced to maintain constant density throughout the experiment the data was modelled with a binomial distribution y bino mial n n n p min μ n 0 999 with the same parameter definitions as above and n being the initial number of prey note that p had to be bounded to avoid overflows with several equation types following calibration each equation s performance within a dataset was ranked according to the widely applicable information criterion waic watanabe 2013 vehtari et al 2017 which takes the number of parameters into account and penalises equations with more parameters in order to avoid overfitting and was recommended over the akaike information criterion aic for use in bayesian analysis gelman et al 2014 lower scores indicate better model fit 4 results and discussion 4 1 theoretical study as indicated in table 2 none of the equations currently available in the literature fulfills the criteria proposed in section 3 which casts doubt on their ability to generate accurate predictions for systems where predator or prey concentrations deviate significantly from static equilibrium conditions the new proposed equation however did yield satisfactory results with regards to all conditions only expectations with regards to equation behaviour under conditions where prey populations approach 0 were uniformly respected meaning that all equations evaluated did accurately predict that per predator and total predation rates fall to 0 when prey populations disappear however each of the other conditions was violated by one or more equation as could be expected prey dependent equations performed poorly in conditions of high predator densities while ratio dependent and hassell varley equations fared better in these conditions however type i predation responses caused problematic behaviour under conditions of high prey densities in all equation types particularly problematic however were cases where total predation rates under very high predator densities either exceeded the total prey population outright e g lim p g or else could exceed it under certain parametrisations of the equations e g lim p g α n b in fact only the new proposed kovai equation showed consistent behaviour with regards to total predation rates under high predator densities additionally none of the equations from the literature correctly predicted the rate of total predation increase upon the addition of an additional prey in many circumstances increasing the prey density by 1 could lead to a much larger increase in total predation rates suggesting that the addition of one prey individual to a system could greatly increasethe predation of the other prey individuals already in the system such behaviour seems unrealistic in the real world and could in modelling studies lead to the prediction of higher predation rates than would be expected only the kovai equation showed consistent behaviour in this regard 4 2 empirical study as can be seen in table 1 the datasets included in the empirical study span a wide range of predator prey relationships as well as equation types and functional responses though type ii and iii responses were more common fig 1 shows how the kovai equation depending on its parametrisation can generate different holling response type forms for different datasets in addition to its accurate representation of both type ii and type iii functional responses with respect to prey density though as expected not type iv the kovai equation can also represent the impact of predator competition for prey on predation rates fig 2 shows the results of different models applied to predation data from kratina et al 2009 including three equations recommended by those authors as well as the kovai equation at low values of p where the prey predator ratio is high enough to avoid predator competition the ratio dependent model was unable to model the impact of absolute prey scarcity on predation rates and therefore confounded the effects of various prey densities fig 2 a on the other hand intermediate form equations hassell varley type iii beddington deangelis and kovai see fig 2 b c and d respectively were successful in distinguishing the effects of prey and predator densities prey dependent models were overall unsuccessful at modelling the data as these models cannot distinguish between different values of p at all and are not shown in the figure fig 3 shows the applicability of various equation types across all datasets used in this study given the kovai equation s ability to adjust to both type ii and type iii functional responses we expected it to show more consistent applicability across datasets with varying functional response forms than pure type ii or type iii equations regardless of prey or ratio dependence datasets were classified by their level of dis similarity to a type ii functional response using the average rank of type ii equations waic fit as compared to the fit of equations with different functional responses when fitted to the data fig 3 compares the average rank lower indicates better fit relative to other equations of different equation groups with the average rank of type ii response equations for each of the different datasets as expected the ranking of type iii equations improved as datasets moved away from a type ii response and the bd equation whose shape resembles a holling type ii form predictably improves in rank the closer the dataset is to a type ii functional response form the kovai equation however ranked consistently across datasets regardless of whether the data showed type ii functional response or not this is most likely due to its parametrisation which allows it to model both type ii and type iii functional responses it is important to note however that as the kovai equation supposes that prey availability will increase along with prey densities it is not suitable for representing type iv functional responses where increasing densities of dangerous prey reduce predators ability to hunt effectively in conclusion the kovai equation provides several main improvements over existing predation equations in the literature for application to discrete time step simulation 1 its main contribution is its improved theoretical consistency in particular in its predictions of total predation at high prey or predator densities and the rate of change of total predation as more prey are added to the system 2 the kovai equation also combines the best of prey and ratio dependent concepts in a mathematically consistent manner by adjusting for predator competition correctly partitioning available prey between predators when prey become limiting while still distinguishing between low and high absolute prey density in the case of otherwise identical prey predator ratios 3 the equation also allows for a mathematically consistent smooth transition between type ii and type iii functional responses based on its parametrisation 5 conclusion while predator prey relationships are central to all ecological modelling of population dynamics a mathematically consistent equation to represent these relationships has proved elusive this research showed that the vast majority of the most common equations currently in use in both theoretical and empirical field ecological research fail to meet several basic criteria for mathematical consistency we propose a list of such criteria to facilitate the evaluation of predation equations developed in the future and propose a new equation that does meet these criteria the empirical evaluation of the new proposed equation also suggests that it is more robust to varying functional response forms found in different ecological contexts author contributions jm conducted the research and wrote the paper jbn contributed to the

24733,correct modelling of relationships between predators and prey is crucial to ecological and population dynamics models however and despite a long standing competition between ratio and prey dependent models and a few alternative intermediate forms in the literature most equations currently used to represent such relationships do not meet theoretical criteria for biological consistency this research proposes a set of universally applicable criteria for all predation equations and shows that the most commonly used predation equations in the literature fail to meet these same criteria we follow with a proposal for a new predation equation that does meet these criteria which combines both prey and ratio dependent concepts while giving reasonable predictions in the cases of both high predator or high prey densities we show its empirical performance by applying the new equation along with existing alternatives to various experimental predation datasets from the literature results show that the new equation is not only more mathematically consistent than existing equations but also performs more consistently empirically across different datasets from various ecological situations this research is the first to propose a systematic set of criteria to evaluate predation equations and then to offer an equation that meets these criteria and also performs well both theoretically and empirically across datasets from a wide range of predation systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords prey dependence ratio dependence kovai equation density dependence functional response 1 introduction correctly representing the relationship between predators and prey is a key challenge to all attempts at modelling trophic interactions and population dynamics kratina et al 2009 a wide range of predation equations is currently available in the ecological literature to calculate predation rates prey consumed per predator per unit time based on an independent variable prey density predator density or both and one or more empirical parameters abrams and ginzburg 2000 these equations can be very generally classified according to the independent variable and the mathematical form functional response of the equation that links this variable to predation rates considering the independent variable predation equations are often divided into prey dependent where the prey population n is the only independent variable and ratio dependent equations where the ratio between prey and predator p populations n p is used as an independent variable a wide variety of intermediate forms have also been proposed of these we here mention some of the most commonly used the hassell varley forms hassell and varley 1969 and the beddington deangelis equation α n n c p b beddington 1975 deangelis et al 1975 the former represent a compromise between prey and ratio dependence where the n p prey predator ratio is replaced by n pm where m is a parameter in the range 0 1 that allows the function to transition smoothly between either prey or ratio dependence the beddington deangelis equation on the other hand incorporates both n and p but not in pure ratio form functional responses on the other hand are generally categorised as type i linearly increasing y α x type ii logarithmic type growth y α x x b type iii sigmoidal type growth y α x 2 x 2 b and type iv increasing to a peak followed by a decreasing response functional responses holling 1959 where xis the independent variable n in the case of prey dependence and n p in the case of ratio dependence type i rarely occurs with the notable exception of filter feeders jeschke et al 2004 type ii indicates predator saturation and type iii combines predator saturation at high prey densities with sigmoidal growth in predation at lower prey densities which could be caused by the saturation of limited prey refuges in the habitat or be indicative of preferential prey switching or learning by the predator type iv would occur in the case of dangerous prey líznarová and pekár 2013 where higher prey densities actually diminish the predator s capacity to feed some equations hassell varley prey dependent and ratio dependent forms can be combined with all response types while others such as beddington deangelis do not lend themselves to such modifications but intrinsically generate functional forms similar to one or more of the holling forms for a comprehensive in depth review of functional response equations the reader is referred to jeschke et al 2002 none of these equations however is completely satisfactory from a theoretical standpoint ratio dependence is unrealistic at low absolute prey densities when the physical scarcity of prey is likely to decrease predation rates as predators spend most of their time searching even if the predator population is itself very low and the prey predator ratio correspondingly high abrams and ginzburg 2000 ratio dependent equations also produce what have been described as unusual results namely infinite prey availability per predator as predator density declines towards 0 gleeson 1994 on the other hand prey dependence is unrealistic at low prey predator ratios when predators must necessarily divide available prey amongst themselves abrams and ginzburg 2000 and studies have found experimental data partially between ratio and prey dependence schenk et al 2005 there is therefore a need for an equation that encompasses both ratio and prey dependence processes while alternatives include equations of intermediate form partially between ratio and prey dependence their formulations as will be discussed later do not necessarily guarantee mathematically sound resolution of the different issues faced by each extreme for instance the transition between prey and ratio dependence in the hassell varley forms is dependent on a parameter not on prey or predator populations while the theoretical considerations mentioned in the preceding paragraph suggest that population levels are important in determining when either relationship is more appropriate switching between equations based on the nature of predator interference in the system has also been proposed skalski and gilliam 2001 there is therefore a need for clear criteria and expected behaviours for all useful predation equations which may promote a more standardised development of predation equations that are widely useful across various population densities and ratios such a list of criteria has been previously proposed by berryman et al 1995 but most relate to complete predator prey models and not to the predation function itself of the criteria that do apply are that predators must have finite appetites and that the potential for intraspecific competition should be included criteria which disqualify prey dependent equations however these criteria apply only to per predator feeding rates and do not include important conditions regarding total predation rates under extreme high or low prey or predator populations despite the long standing debate many of these issues have still not been satisfactorily resolved abrams 2015 and these equations are widely used in theoretical and practical research despite their previously identified shortcomings even prey dependence and type i functional responses which have been shown to be in most ecological systems generally inferior to other though imperfect alternatives abrams and ginzburg 2000 jeschke et al 2004 have been recently used as part of larger ecological and population dynamics models chesson and kuang 2008 sanchez et al 2018 sanders et al 2018 imbert et al 2020 these shortcomings occur because most of these equations are built upon assumptions mainly non extreme prey and predator population densities that are unlikely to hold true under natural conditions when applied to discrete time steps as they most often are in prediction modelling and in many field studies these are structural equation model errors which cannot be circumvented through parametrisation and calibration as such the predictions of these equations under extreme conditions such as those often seen in agriculture or other human managed systems may be invalid for instance equations whose assumptions do not hold under conditions of very high predator density gleeson 1994 abrams and ginzburg 2000 are unlikely to give correct predictions with regards to augmentative biocontrol efforts where large numbers of predators or parasitoids are released into the field this is a major impediment to the successful application of predator prey equations to ecological and especially agroecological modelling as kratina et al 2009 have observed choosing appropriate functional responses is crucial for adequate predictions of food web dynamics when ratio dependence is incorporated into predator prey models their stability is usually enhanced highlighting the importance of correct functional response equations to ecological model behaviour and reliability this paper addresses this gap in the literature by 1 proposing a standard set of criteria that all useful predation equations should observe when applied to discrete time steps 2 showing that the majority of equations available in the literature fail to meet one or several of these conditions and 3 proposing a new equation kovai equation for modelling predation rates that does meet these criteria the paper concludes with 4 a comparative evaluation of the performance of all reviewed equations by applying them to a range of predation datasets from the literature to demonstrate the practical improvements offered by the improved predation equation formulation this is the first research article to comprehensively address limitations in existing predation equations and to offer a mathematically sound improvement to these equations that performs well both theoretically and empirically 2 standard criteria for predation functions predation equations may be defined as the predation rate per predator per unit time f n p or as the total predation rate per unit time g n p p f n p where n and p are the prey and predator densities respectively the following sections present a proposed set of standard criteria for predation equations when applied to discrete time step simulations followed by a proposed equation that satisfies them in the following sections α denotes the maximum feeding rate for the predator or the amount of prey per unit time that an individual predator can consume if no time is wasted searching for prey as comparison commonly used equations from the literature were evaluated according to the same criteria including prey dependent ratio dependent and the intermediate hassell varley equation hassell and varley 1969 each combined with type i ii and iii holling functional response forms holling 1959 abrams and ginzburg 2000 three other equations which do not lend themselves to combination with distinct holling functional response forms the beddington deangelis equation beddington 1975 deangelis et al 1975 the crowley martin equation crowley and martin 1989 and the royama rogers equation royama 1971 rogers 1972 kfir 1983 were also tested see table 2 for a full definition of each equation 2 1 behaviour at high prey density as prey density increases predation per predator should at most asymptotically approach the maximum feeding rate for the predator in mathematical terms 0 lim n f n p α and by extension 0 lim n g n p α p 2 2 behaviour at low prey density as prey density approaches 0 both total as well as per predator predation should tend towards 0 that is lim n 0 f n p lim n 0 g n p 0 2 3 behaviour at high predator density as predator density increases overall predation should increase asymptotically towards the total prey population available or potentially to a lesser value the latter could be caused by the presence of some habitat niches that offer complete predation protection to a limited number of prey or else due to interference between predator individuals at the same time prey availability per predator should decrease as predators begin competing for prey in mathematical terms lim p g n p n though lim p f n p 0 2 4 behaviour at low predator density on the other hand as predator density decreases the total predation should also approach 0 lim p 0 g n p 0 while predation per predator may vary in no case should it be higher than the maximum feeding rate per predator that is 0 lim p 0 f n p α 2 5 other considerations finally many equations consider the functional response of predation rates to be dependent of a measure of prey abundance often prey density or else the prey predator ratio based on the assumption that predation rates are not a constant function of prey abundance and will instead likely change nonlinearly along with prey abundance for instance due to predator saturation or else to the existence of niches where a subpopulation of prey may be partially shielded from predation two of the three types type ii and type iii of functional response proposed by holling holling 1959 and widely used since were designed to model such effects however although one may reasonably expect that additional prey added to a system may be more vulnerable to predation than already present prey due for instance to the saturation of protected niches the addition of new prey should in no circumstance increase the instantaneous predation risk for prey that was already present in other words adding 1 unit of prey cannot increase total predation by more than 1 unit of prey or mathematically 0 d g d n 1 2 6 the kovai equation as can be later seen in table 2 most equations currently used for modelling predation fail in at least one of the above mentioned criteria we here describe a new equation which we propose to call by the name of the city where research leading to its development was conducted f n p α 1 e n u α p u 1 b n 1 e n b the first part of the kovai equation takes the ratio between predator and prey into account partitioning available prey amongst the predators present in this sense the kovai equation is similar to a ratio dependent equation but instead of using the raw prey density to calculate the prey predator ratio a measure of effective prey availability u is used that takes the scarcity of the prey and prey refuges into account and ranges between 0 and 1 this performs a similar purpose as the holling type iii functional response but retains the notable advantage that d d n u n 1 e n b which is in the range 0 1 for non negative b thereby ensuring that the effective prey availability will never increase faster than the prey density itself does bmay be interpreted as the maximum capacity of prey refuges lim n n n u lim n n n b 1 e n b b or alternatively as the prey density at which e 1 36 8 of the prey is accessible to the predator at low values of b the equation presents a functional response form similar to the holling type ii form allowing this parameter to control the functional response form of the equation in addition the fact that u is dependent on n and not on the ratio n p enables the kovai equation to account for prey scarcity in a similar manner to prey dependent equations 3 methods empirical study 12 experimental studies with predation functional response data were taken from the literature for a total of 29 distinct datasets table 1 where data was only available in the form of figures instead of tables these were first digitised using the web version of webplotdigitizer rohatgi 2019 all analyses were run in python 3 7 python software foundation psf 2019 using the libraries numpy van der walt et al 2011 pandas mckinney 2010 and pymc3 salvatier et al 2016 p 3 for mathematical analyses graphs were plotted using seaborn michael waskom et al 2018 and matplotlib hunter 2007 all data and code used to run the analyses and plot the figures present in this article are included in the supplementary material each of the equations in table 2 were calibrated using bayesian inference hamiltonian monte carlo no u turn sampler algorithm hoffman and gelman 2014 with each of the datasets using weakly informative priors in the case of experiments where prey densities were held constant theoretically infinite predation opportunities the functional response was modelled with a poisson distribution as follows y p o i s s o n μ n where y is the total number of predation events observed across all replicates n is the number of replicates and µ is calculated according to each equation s specification when as was most often the case prey were not replaced to maintain constant density throughout the experiment the data was modelled with a binomial distribution y bino mial n n n p min μ n 0 999 with the same parameter definitions as above and n being the initial number of prey note that p had to be bounded to avoid overflows with several equation types following calibration each equation s performance within a dataset was ranked according to the widely applicable information criterion waic watanabe 2013 vehtari et al 2017 which takes the number of parameters into account and penalises equations with more parameters in order to avoid overfitting and was recommended over the akaike information criterion aic for use in bayesian analysis gelman et al 2014 lower scores indicate better model fit 4 results and discussion 4 1 theoretical study as indicated in table 2 none of the equations currently available in the literature fulfills the criteria proposed in section 3 which casts doubt on their ability to generate accurate predictions for systems where predator or prey concentrations deviate significantly from static equilibrium conditions the new proposed equation however did yield satisfactory results with regards to all conditions only expectations with regards to equation behaviour under conditions where prey populations approach 0 were uniformly respected meaning that all equations evaluated did accurately predict that per predator and total predation rates fall to 0 when prey populations disappear however each of the other conditions was violated by one or more equation as could be expected prey dependent equations performed poorly in conditions of high predator densities while ratio dependent and hassell varley equations fared better in these conditions however type i predation responses caused problematic behaviour under conditions of high prey densities in all equation types particularly problematic however were cases where total predation rates under very high predator densities either exceeded the total prey population outright e g lim p g or else could exceed it under certain parametrisations of the equations e g lim p g α n b in fact only the new proposed kovai equation showed consistent behaviour with regards to total predation rates under high predator densities additionally none of the equations from the literature correctly predicted the rate of total predation increase upon the addition of an additional prey in many circumstances increasing the prey density by 1 could lead to a much larger increase in total predation rates suggesting that the addition of one prey individual to a system could greatly increasethe predation of the other prey individuals already in the system such behaviour seems unrealistic in the real world and could in modelling studies lead to the prediction of higher predation rates than would be expected only the kovai equation showed consistent behaviour in this regard 4 2 empirical study as can be seen in table 1 the datasets included in the empirical study span a wide range of predator prey relationships as well as equation types and functional responses though type ii and iii responses were more common fig 1 shows how the kovai equation depending on its parametrisation can generate different holling response type forms for different datasets in addition to its accurate representation of both type ii and type iii functional responses with respect to prey density though as expected not type iv the kovai equation can also represent the impact of predator competition for prey on predation rates fig 2 shows the results of different models applied to predation data from kratina et al 2009 including three equations recommended by those authors as well as the kovai equation at low values of p where the prey predator ratio is high enough to avoid predator competition the ratio dependent model was unable to model the impact of absolute prey scarcity on predation rates and therefore confounded the effects of various prey densities fig 2 a on the other hand intermediate form equations hassell varley type iii beddington deangelis and kovai see fig 2 b c and d respectively were successful in distinguishing the effects of prey and predator densities prey dependent models were overall unsuccessful at modelling the data as these models cannot distinguish between different values of p at all and are not shown in the figure fig 3 shows the applicability of various equation types across all datasets used in this study given the kovai equation s ability to adjust to both type ii and type iii functional responses we expected it to show more consistent applicability across datasets with varying functional response forms than pure type ii or type iii equations regardless of prey or ratio dependence datasets were classified by their level of dis similarity to a type ii functional response using the average rank of type ii equations waic fit as compared to the fit of equations with different functional responses when fitted to the data fig 3 compares the average rank lower indicates better fit relative to other equations of different equation groups with the average rank of type ii response equations for each of the different datasets as expected the ranking of type iii equations improved as datasets moved away from a type ii response and the bd equation whose shape resembles a holling type ii form predictably improves in rank the closer the dataset is to a type ii functional response form the kovai equation however ranked consistently across datasets regardless of whether the data showed type ii functional response or not this is most likely due to its parametrisation which allows it to model both type ii and type iii functional responses it is important to note however that as the kovai equation supposes that prey availability will increase along with prey densities it is not suitable for representing type iv functional responses where increasing densities of dangerous prey reduce predators ability to hunt effectively in conclusion the kovai equation provides several main improvements over existing predation equations in the literature for application to discrete time step simulation 1 its main contribution is its improved theoretical consistency in particular in its predictions of total predation at high prey or predator densities and the rate of change of total predation as more prey are added to the system 2 the kovai equation also combines the best of prey and ratio dependent concepts in a mathematically consistent manner by adjusting for predator competition correctly partitioning available prey between predators when prey become limiting while still distinguishing between low and high absolute prey density in the case of otherwise identical prey predator ratios 3 the equation also allows for a mathematically consistent smooth transition between type ii and type iii functional responses based on its parametrisation 5 conclusion while predator prey relationships are central to all ecological modelling of population dynamics a mathematically consistent equation to represent these relationships has proved elusive this research showed that the vast majority of the most common equations currently in use in both theoretical and empirical field ecological research fail to meet several basic criteria for mathematical consistency we propose a list of such criteria to facilitate the evaluation of predation equations developed in the future and propose a new equation that does meet these criteria the empirical evaluation of the new proposed equation also suggests that it is more robust to varying functional response forms found in different ecological contexts author contributions jm conducted the research and wrote the paper jbn contributed to the

24734,existing studies disjointly addressed the environmental convergence and environmental kuznets curve hypotheses though these research lines are theoretically interconnected this paper proposes a unified empirical methodology to simultaneously investigate both hypotheses relying on a semiparametric dynamic panel data model that accounts for regressor endogeneity the approach when applied to co2 emissions in 106 countries suggests that there is no global level evidence supporting the environmental kuznets hypothesis while a convergence process is taking place our results imply that current international agreements have not been sufficiently binding to globally curb co2 emissions especially in high income countries as aimed by sustainable development goals keywords environmental kuznets curve environmental convergence co2 emissions regressor endogeneity semiparametric panel data model 1 introduction this paper proposes a unified framework bridging two lines of empirical literature in environmental and ecological economics the environmental convergence ec and the environmental kuznets curve ekc hypotheses the ekc argument states that environmental degradation increases with income until a turning point after which it decreases depicting an inverted u shaped curve as in figure 1 ec occurs if countries with low emissions of pollutants per capita increase their level of emissions while the opposite applies to high emissions countries leading to a catch up in pollutants emissions per capita indeed the ekc hypothesis holds if the richest and most polluting countries reduce their emissions as long as this is true the process of economic growth undertaken by poorer and developing countries will get their level of emissions per capita closer to that of developed economies this is also what a convergence process implies nguyen van 2005 strazicich and list 2003 1 1 however convergence can take place even if high polluting economies do not reduce their emissions for instance low emissions countries could increase their pollutant impact and fill the gap with the most polluting economies in such a case countries would be converging to a high level of emissions thus the two lines of research are theoretically related and are worth a unified empirical treatment though the interconnection between these two topics existing empirical studies so far discuss the ekc and ec hypotheses in separate frameworks this has been the case among others in the studies by galeotti et al 2006 nasr et al 2015 and apergis 2016 for the ekc analysis and in mohammadi and ram 2012 and criado and grether 2011 for ec from a policy perspective evidence of ec together with an ekc relationship would have two consequences firstly it may ensure sustainability of the economic growth process secondly it would make global agreements targeting the reduction of pollutants or greenhouse gas ghg emissions politically feasible as developing countries would be encouraged to accept a cap on their emissions without fearing serious consequences for economic growth romero ávila 2008 our paper s contribution to the existing literature is twofold firstly it introduces a novel and robust unified empirical framework a semiparametric dynamic panel data model relating the ekc argument to ec secondly it relies on the latter unified framework to simultaneously investigate i whether the current growth process is sustainable and ii whether the existing global agreements are sufficiently efficient in reducing ghg emissions this paper therefore brings together economic and policy discussions from two empirical strands into a unified framework which accounts for misspecification biases related to functional form and or regressor endogeneity it must be highlighted that the scope of the application to co2 emissions data in this paper is neither to investigate their determinants nor to determine the ceteris paribus impact of income on co2 emissions 2 2 that is to say we do not provide a list of additional regressors in order to explain emissions as remarked by azomahou et al 2006 it would be difficult to include all the relevant factors and any choice would be rather arbitrary see kang et al 2016 and wang et al 2016 etc for an exercise in that direction by additionally accounting for spatial effects while he and wang 2012 baek 2015 and apergis and ozturk 2015 among others depart from the standard ekc regression by including the role of other factors such as economic structure energy use population institutional quality etc in shaping ghg emissions our concern is rather the provision of a robust long run relationship between ghg emissions and income together with the assessment of the existence of an ec process with our data by doing so we will be able to discuss whether a sustainable growth process is in place whether groups of economies are converging in terms of co2 emissions and which levels of emissions the economies are actually converging to the paper proceeds as follows section 2 overviews the related literature section 3 presents the data and investigates distribution dynamics of co2 emissions per capita following the approach originally proposed by quah 1996 section 4 describes the econometric specification in section 5 we present the results for the semiparametric specification as well as for several parametric estimators in section 6 we distinguish between oecd and non oecd economies and we perform some robustness checks within the traditional parametric estimators and compare them with the semiparametric specifications section 7 concludes the analysis 2 linking the ekc and the ec hypotheses theoretically the ekc relationship between environmental degradation and income per capita figure 1 is triggered by three mechanisms panayotou 1993 stern 2004 firstly the composition of output determines the environmental impact of economic activities hence economies mostly specialized in agricultural production or tertiary activities pollute less than economies relying mostly on manufacturing production it follows that the ekc is strictly linked to the transition from a manufacturing to a service based economy since the tertiarization of the economy favours changes in the input mix which becomes less environmentally damaging marsiglio et al 2016 secondly technological advance may promote the adoption of the above mentioned changes in the input mix as well as the diffusion of less polluting techniques of production favouring energy efficiency stern 2004 turner and hanley 2011 finally changes in individual preferences together with regulation and enforcement contribute to increasing supply and demand for environmentally friendly goods and services 3 3 this perspective however has some critics arrow et al 1995 and stern et al 1996 noted that the process is mainly driven by the reallocation of polluting economic activities from developed to developing countries while dasgupta et al 2002 noted that the argument does not apply to every pollutant ec theoretically implies that environmental degradation in per capita occurs faster in pre industrial economies than in post industrial economies leading to a catch up phenomenon among countries regarding co2 emissions several mechanisms engender ec primarily while international agreements kyoto protocol establish emission goals for high income economies no commitments exist for developing countries furthermore as noted by requate 2005 and vine and hamrin 2008 economic instruments such price based carbon taxes and rights based measures drive reduction of emissions in industrialized countries in addition to tertiarization of the economy and technological advance these mechanisms while slowing down environmental degradation in high income countries favour growing co2 emissions in low income countries payne 2020 relating the ekc and ec hypotheses the only existing theoretical study we have identified is the work by brock and taylor 2010 these authors proposed a green solow model where the ekc appears as a by product of the convergence process to a sustainable growth path their model predicts a conditional convergence of pollutant emissions similarly to the concept of conditional income convergence brock and taylor 2010 made the observation that the mechanisms leading to income growth and convergence are also at the origin of the ekc and the ec this is particularly relevant when international agreement and economic instruments are sufficiently strong enough to flatten and then significantly curb down co2 emissions in high income countries thus even in case where substantial decreases in emissions a notable downward trend do not occur in high income countries as depicted by figure 1 ec a catch up remains possible as long as industrialized countries decelerate environmental degradation while pre industrial countries do not therefore based on this discussion we can make the conjecture that the existence of an ekc can imply conditional environmental convergence similarly to the case of income convergence however the reverse would not be true i e the existence of conditional ec is not sufficient to ensure the emergence of an ekc relationship as illustrated by figure 2 our study proposes a novel empirical approach which will be detailed below to test this conjecture which has never been tested so far 3 related ekc and ec literature 3 1 the ekc literature investigating the ekc hypothesis traces back to the nineties following the leading studies by bank 1992 shafik and bandyopadhyay 1992 grossman and krueger 1993 1995 and panayotou 1993 among others empirical analyses of the ekc hypothesis abound in the literature 4 4 this review does not cover studies on granger causality between energy and growth as our paper is about a different topic various environmental degradation indicators have been examined emissions or concentrations of pollutants co co2 so2 no x among others deforestation rate water quality etc the standard approach adopts a parametric specification in which the environmental indicator in per capita is regressed on income per capita as a linear quadratic and also cubic function results vary according to the environmental indicator and the data sample under analysis for instance suri and chapman 1998 used parametric panel models finding that the relationship between energy consumption and income displays an increasing pattern with turning point outside the data sample richmond and kaufmann 2006a b by using parametric specifications for panel data found little evidence of an ekc for energy consumption which increases with income at a decreasing rate the study of özokcu and özdemir 2017 based on panel data estimation did not give any empirical support to the ekc neither for oecd countries nor for a sample of 52 emerging countries observed over the period 1980 2010 in addition based on a spatial and panel gmm analysis wang et al 2016 wang and he 2019 found no support for an ekc for co2 emissions in chinese provinces and regions for the period 1995 2013 the panel data study performed by del pablo romero and dejesús 2016 did not either support the ekc hypothesis for 22 countries in latin america and the caribbean for the period 1990 2011 on the contrary apergis and ozturk 2015 applying a parametric gmm model to a panel data of 14 asian countries found evidence of an ekc for co2 emissions similarly to sarkodie and strezov 2019 on the sample of 17 african countries observed between 1971 and 2013 it is to observe that existing parametric models are based on relatively restricted assumptions dijkgraaf and vollebergh 2005 cast doubt on the ekc results based on parametric panel data models by pointing out the weakness of the parameters homogeneity assumption underlying these models similar results are obtained by hettige et al 2000 heil and selden 2001 and bertinelli and strobl 2005 for different indicators while evidence of an inverted u shaped relationship was obtained by shafik 1994 and schmalensee et al 1998 etc more recently semi and non parametric techniques have been implemented to investigate the validity of the ekc hypothesis the advantage of such an approach is that semi and non parametric estimations do not require the specification of an ad hoc functional form however even in such a case empirical results are still not univocal and vary with the sample and the indicator used for instance nguyen van 2010 found no evidence of an ekc for energy consumption using semiparametric techniques applied on a panel of countries while a similar result was obtained by nasr et al 2015 for south africa a carbon intensive and non oil producing developing country differently sephton and mann 2013 and apergis 2016 provided empirical support for the ekc hypothesis in the case of spain and for 12 countries respectively 5 5 see stern 2004 azomahou et al 2006 kijima et al 2010 and bo 2011 for a more detailed review on non parametric ekc studies as the purpose of our paper is not to systematically review the ekc literature we only report some existing papers to motivate our approach other papers can be found in previous issues of journals in the field like ecological indicators energy economics and renewable and sustainable energy reviews which can give more insights on parametric and non parametric investigations on the ekc hypothesis using panel or time series data on various environmental indicators recently shahbaz et al 2017 revisited the co2 emissions income nexus for g7 countries by combining non parametric and time series techniques using historical data covering the period 1820 2015 the authors showed evidence of ekc for almost every country in the g7 except japan moreover mixed results appear in the studies by ansari et al 2020 kacprzyk and kuchta 2020 sarkodie and strezov 2019 and altıntaş and kassouri 2020 while the meta analysis by sarkodie and strezov 2019 leads to blurred conclusions regarding the existence of an ekc it is noted that differences in time span econometric specifications estimation methods and in indicators justify the results disparity thus kacprzyk and kuchta 2020 and altıntaş and kassouri 2020 respectively using data samples on 161 countries observed between 1992 2012 and 14 countries observed between 1991 2014 find results indicating that ekc also depends on environmental and development indicators in conclusion it is to observe that independently on environmental indicators econometric specification and data sample existing studies overlooked the interconnection between ekc and ec 3 2 the ec literature environmental convergence has been a prolific subject of empirical studies following methodologies used in the economic growth literature hence the topic has been investigated in terms of β convergence using cross sectional analysis as in strazicich and list 2003 mohammadi and ram 2012 and brock and taylor 2010 among others panel data models see e g nguyen van 2005 miketa and mulder 2005 mulder and de groot 2007 panopoulou and pantelidis 2009 criado et al 2011 camarero et al 2013 distribution dynamics techniques for instance in nguyen van 2005 aldy 2006 criado and grether 2011 criado et al 2011 bassetti et al 2013 or time series approach e g strazicich and list 2003 6 6 see pettersson et al 2014 for a survey on environmental convergence studies however less attention has been devoted to the link between the ekc hypothesis and ec in particular accounting for the implications described above even though in some cases the standard ekc equation has been transformed in a dynamic setting by adding lagged emissions among the regressors there is no explicit argument relative to convergence this has been done mainly to justify a persistent behaviour in emissions this is the case for example of agras and chapman 1999 bernard et al 2015 lee et al 2009 in which no reference to the ec was made 7 7 for example lee et al 2009 estimate the convergence equation in levels rather than in logs which would be required to keep consistency with a standard convergence model see islam 2003 theoretically some specific models for ec in an ekc framework were given by bulte et al 2007 and brock and taylor 2010 which build on the solow model assuming that pollution occurs as a by product of economic activity and it can be reduced through abatement efforts in a slightly different vein criado et al 2011 adopted a a ramsey cass koopmans model without referring to the ekc hypothesis to provide theoretical support and empirical evidence for ec such a theoretical background and the lack of an empirical strategy clearly addressing together convergence and the ekc motivate the present study im recent literature researchers have been considering in addition to co2 emissions environmental indicators such emissions and energy intensities as well as eco efficiency index in addressing ec among others this has been the case in the study by apergis and payne 2017 camarero et al 2013 zhao et al 2015 and yu et al 2019 relying on eco efficiency indicators obtained by data envelopment camarero et al 2013 assess ec to find results suggesting the existence of 4 convergence clubs across oecd countries comparable results appear in the study by barassi et al 2018 for 28 oecd countries stochastic convergence and by zhao et al 2015 and apergis and payne 2017 respectively in 30 chinese provinces and 50 us states finally considering co2 and energy intensity in value added fernández amador et al 2019 and apergis et al 2020 also investigate the ec hypothesis the primer using a conditional β approach on the sample of 66 countries and 12 regions provide evidence supporting slower global convergence in addition to country specific conditional convergence the latter on a sample of 6 central america countries mainly conclude for the existence of 2 convergence clubs overall contrary to ekc studies where depending on samples model specifications and estimation procedures discordant results are observed it is to note that studies on ec seem less divergent whether the framework is β σ or stochastic convergence nevertheless as mentioned above existing studies so far lack of a framework linking ekc to ec in what follows we propose a unique framework to concurrently assess the occurrence of both the ekc hypothesis and ec using co2 emissions as an illustrative application since it is a major greenhouse gas and closely linked to energy consumption and economic activity the estimation relies on the panel data model proposed by li and stengos 1996 baltagi and li 2002 and li and racine 2007 this approach has two interesting aspects firstly it allows for a dynamic structure capturing some habits or persistence behaviour in co2 emissions since emissions cuts might take time indeed the literature has shown that adoption of energy saving technologies is costly and that diffusion of these technologies is a lengthy process jaffe and stavins 1994 mulder et al 2003 moreover and most important for our purposes such a dynamic setting can be used to test for convergence following the panel solution provided by islam 1995 in the spirit of a theoretical framework in line with bulte et al 2007 and brock and taylor 2010 secondly our model includes a non parametric function of income which allows us to avoid possible misspecified functional forms that might affect parametric ekc studies azomahou et al 2006 bertinelli and strobl 2005 4 data and distribution dynamics 4 1 data we use co2 emissions per capita in kiloton of oil equivalent drawn from the world development indicators this corresponds to carbon dioxide emissions stemming from the burning of fossil fuels and the manufacture of cement co2 emissions are then strictly linked to production and economic activity in general gdp per capita output side real gdp is instead drawn from the penn world table 9 0 and expressed in ppp of 2011 the sample includes 106 countries which greatly differ in gdp per capita over the period 1970 2015 we also focus the analysis on two subsamples consisting of 21 oecd and 85 non oecd economies to assess potential heterogeneities between developed and developing countries table 1 reports the descriptive statistics the high value of the standard deviation for both gdp and co2 emissions per capita is indicative of the heterogeneity of the sample the very high maximum value for gdp per capita corresponds to saudi arabia in 1973 similar high values are also observed for bahrain especially in the seventies the highest value of co2 emissions per capita corresponds to bahamas in which consumption of liquid fuels more than doubled in the seventies for then reverting to the previous trend in the eighties overall higher levels of co2 per capita are observed in the oil countries included in the sample bahrain and saudi arabia and also in luxembourg and the united states complementary to table 1 figure 3 reports the kernel density estimates values are standardized with respect to the mean i e relative values the distribution of co2 and gdp per capita is reported for the waves 1975 1995 and 2015 and the pattern is similar in both cases the proportion of countries at the bottom of the distribution is decreasing over time while the mass increases in the interval 1 3 favouring a bimodal distribution in the case of gdp per capita this implies that the average levels of gdp and co2 are increasing over time underlying that co2 is a by product of economic activity 4 2 distribution dynamics convergence analysis in growth econometrics is usually done by either estimating a convergence equation using cross sectional data panel data or time series however the estimation results provide information regarding the average behaviour in the sample and no relevant insights are given with respect to relative performances of the entire sample distribution hence the analysis of distribution dynamics is a complementary tool providing a complete picture of co2 emissions quah 1996 1997 in particular we study the evolution of the distribution of co2 emissions assuming that the process determining its dynamics is time invariant and first order johnson 2000 2005 so that the distribution prevailing at time t τ is given by 1 ϕ t τ y 0 f τ y x ϕ t x d x where x and y are relative co2 emissions per capita i e standardized with mean value at time t and t τ respectively function ϕt x corresponds to the distribution of emissions at time t finally fτ y x is the conditional density that informs about transition dynamics within the distribution during the period considered mapping the position of each country at time t and t τ 8 8 the conditional density represents the continuous analogue of the transition matrix see johnson 2000 2005 and nguyen van 2005 for estimation details figure 4 plots fτ y x for which τ 5 hence considering data for 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 9 9 results obtained with τ 10 are very similar observations that did not change their relative position from t to t τ lie on the 45 degrees line observations below the 45 degrees line improved their relative position along the period i e relative emissions increase in t τ conditionally to information in t while observations above fell behind i e relative emissions decrease in t τ the density contours and the dotted line which is the median curve plotted in figure 4 show that observations of the distribution are stable over time notably for observations between the range 0 5 1 5 the observed peak for values close to 0 is below the 45 degrees line indicating an improvement of their relative positions in the distribution overall the picture shows a convergence pattern for low emitting countries towards higher emission values whereas the relative positions of high emitting countries remain stable over time higher levels of co2 emissions are usually observed in high income countries because of the output structure largely relying on fossil energy use simultaneously these countries are the most engaged in policies to reduce the environmental impact of economic activity and to exploit alternative energy sources taking into account this heterogeneity related to high income countries we perform the above analysis for the subsample of 21 oecd countries figure 5 plots the resulting conditional density the contours indicate that contrary to the full sample distribution dynamics are characterized by higher mobility two main peaks can be detected one of them between 0 5 and 1 below the 45 degrees line suggesting an increase in emissions for low emitting countries another peak in the upper tail around 2 of the distribution is mostly located above the 45 degrees line suggesting a reduction of emissions for high emitting countries hence this suggests a bi polarization process among oecd countries but with a convergence for the whole oecd countries such evidence is consistent with findings for industrial countries reported by nguyen van 2005 and strazicich and list 2003 5 the econometric model to complete the previous distribution analysis we propose a framework to study the nexus between income and an environmental indicator the latter corresponds to co2 emissions for our illustrative application following the definition of income convergence in the panel data framework proposed by islam 1995 we can model convergence for environmental indicator y or co2 emissions per capita as follows 2 y i t α y i t 1 ζ i t where yit is the log of co2 emissions per capita of country i i 1 n at period t t 1 t the equation allows capturing the local dynamics toward the steady state more generally it accounts for adjustment dynamics of emissions over time if α is less than 1 pollutants in time t 1 are a smaller proportion of the level in t it should be noted that in equation 2 α exp λ τ where λ and τ respectively indicate the rate of convergence and the time span the former measures how fast emissions are converging to their steady state or more generally how fast the gap between countries is being closed 10 10 islam 2003 remarked the tension between the neoclassical and the general interpretation of the convergence parameters α and λ this tension arises whenever additional regressors other than the lagged dependent variable are considered in such a case if the neoclassical derivation of equation 2 is considered convergence towards each economy s steady state and the reduction of cross countries gaps do not longer coincide the smaller α the larger the rate of convergence λ when an estimation of α is available we can use the delta method to recover λ islam 2003 the time span between t and t 1 may be fixed to a period of several years following islam 1995 we opt for 5 years time intervals in order to avoid short term disturbances or business cycle fluctuations which are likely present in shorter periods hence as in the previous analysis about distribution dynamics the data used in the regressions below correspond to 1970 1975 2015 regarding the co2 emissions gdp nexus ekc literature existing studies usually assume the following parametric specification for an environmental indicator y and income z in logs y i t z i t β η i t often relying on a quadratic form in income z i t β β 0 β 1 z i t β 2 z i t 2 our methodological novelty involves gathering these two analytical perspectives into a single equation specification which allows for investigating both the ekc and the ec hypotheses 11 11 as stated the scope of this study is to investigate the long run relation between co2 emission and gdp it does not investigate the determinants of co2 emissions nor determine the ceteris paribus effect of gdp 3 y i t α y i t 1 z i t β ε i t we assume that the data are independent across the i index it is also assumed that the residuals in model 3 are given by ε i t μ i u i t where μi represents the country specific effect and uit the usual error term moreover our analysis is based on the case of large n and fixed t it should be noted that this model can be estimated by using divers approaches random effects gls estimator fixed effects within estimator instrumental variables iv however the presence of the lagged dependent variable y i t 1 implies a correlation between it and the regression residuals which makes the re gls and the fe within estimators inconsistent and then justifies the use of the iv estimator 12 12 the parametric model can be also estimated using the gmm estimators developed by arellano and bond 1991 arellano and bover 1995 and blundell and bond 1998 which work under the assumption that y i t 1 and zit are weakly exogenous or predetermined i e e u i t y i t 1 s e u i t z i s 0 s t gmm estimates not reported here however provide mixed results recent studies underline the possible misspecification regarding the parametric form of the ekc azomahou et al 2006 bertinelli and strobl 2005 taking this into account we replace the parametric function z i t β by a non parametric form g zit which does not require any ad doc functional form the resulting specification is the semiparametric dynamic panel data model 4 4 y i t α y i t 1 g z i t ε i t with ε i t μ i u i t the model includes the situation where μi are considered as random effects the case of fixed effects μi is interesting but much more complex to handle 13 13 this issue would deserve to be studied in a further work moreover the model covers the case e u i t z i s 0 s t which is much more general than the assumption e u i t z i s 0 s t usually adopted in existing parametric settings estimation of model in 4 can be performed following the methods developed by li and stengos 1996 baltagi and li 2002 and li and racine 2007 these authors proposed two instrumental variable solutions for estimating α which also allow for the assumption that the residuals ε it are serially correlated following this procedure we firstly eliminate g zit as in robinson 1988 by taking the expectation of 4 conditional on zit and then by subtracting it from 4 this yields 5 y i t e y i t z i t α y i t 1 e y i t 1 z i t ε i t e ε i t z i t α v i t ξ i t where v i t y i t 1 e y i t 1 z i t and ξ i t ε i t e ε i t z i t if we use e ε i t z i t 0 then ξ i t ε i t following li and stengos 1996 and baltagi and li 2002 assuming there exists q 1 instrumental variables wit which are correlated with y i t 1 and uncorrelated with ξit the instrumental variable estimators are given by 6 α i v o v w w v 1 v w w y ψ 7 α i v g v σ 1 w w σ 1 w 1 w σ 1 v 1 v σ 1 w w σ 1 w 1 w σ 1 y e y i t z i t where ψit e yit zit note that estimator 6 is computed using ols while estimator 7 relies on gls using wit as an instrument moreover the ivo estimator requires wit to be weakly exogenous while the ivg requires strong exogeneity of the instrument and conditional homoskedasticity of the residuals li and stengos 1996 used w i t z i t 1 as an iv for v i t y i t 1 e y i t 1 z i t because z i t 1 is uncorrelated with ξit and it is possibly correlated with vit however baltagi and li 2002 showed that in some cases e v i t z i t 1 0 so that w i t z i t 1 is uncorrelated with vit 14 14 see baltagi and li 2002 for more details to avoid this possibility they proposed to use w i t e y i t 1 z i t 1 instead of z i t 1 as an instrument for vit this is the approach we follow it should be noted that these conditional expectations in estimations are replaced by the non parametric kernel estimators i e w i t i t n t k z i t y i t 1 i t n t k z i t where k is the kernel function in addition we use bootstrap procedures to get consistent estimates of standard errors when an estimator of α is available g can be non parametrically estimated by applying the kernel regression to equation 3 g z i t e y i t α y i t 1 z i t 15 15 the analysis would account for series nonstationarity if the time dimension t was high in the empirical application as performed below as we focus on the long run relationship between variables by using observations corresponding to five years periods thus t 10 in order to eliminate business cycle effects our estimation is then less concerned by this issue there exist very numerous ekc studies based on time series for more details on them one can refer to e g bölük and mert 2015 benjebli et al 2016 benyoussef et al 2016 apergis et al 2017 liu et al 2017 and zoundi 2017 to name just a few a further piece of information concerns the appropriateness of the functional form indeed it may be interesting to test whether the parametric functional form is a good approximation therefore we apply the procedure developed by henderson et al 2008 to test the parametric dynamic panel data model in 3 against the semiparametric dynamic panel data model in 4 the test statistic is given by 8 i n 1 n t i n t t α y i t 1 z i t β α y i t 1 g z i t 2 where α and β denote the consistent estimators based on model 3 and α and g are consistent estimators based on 4 the h 0 hypothesis corresponds to the parametric model 3 while the alternative h 1 is the semiparametric specification 4 note that in converges to zero in probability under the null and it converges to a positive constant under the alternative however the asymptotic distribution of in is unknown therefore henderson et al 2008 employed a bootstrap procedure to generate an empirical distribution for in which approximates its finite sample null distribution hence our inference is done by calculating such an empirical distribution 16 16 the bootstrap procedure generates r new samples of y i t according to the parametric model then both models 3 and 4 are estimated r times and the respective coefficients are obtained for further details see henderson et al 2008 6 estimation results 6 1 specification tests at a first step we compare various parametric models hausman test tests results are reported in table e1 overall the random effect estimator is rejected in favour of a fe specification also the iv estimator which takes the endogeneity of y i t 1 into account outperforms the fe within estimator 17 17 see appendix c for more details on the test results and the re and fe estimations at a second step though the semiparametric models have the advantage of imposing no ad hoc parametric functional form their results could be compared to those of a parametric specification in what follows we perform further specification tests using the henderson et al 2008 comparing the semiparametric counterpart among then and also to the iv estimator in order to find the most reasonable approximation to the data applying the test of henderson et al 2008 we compare the iv parametric model to both the ivo and ivg semiparametric models the null hypothesis being that the iv estimator is preferred the test statistics for the whole sample case are respectively 6 233 and 6 140 for the ivo and ivg alternatives compared to the semiparametric models the test results reject the iv estimator replicating the test for the oecd and non oecd subsamples provides very comparable results hence both the ivo and the ivg appear to be good fits for our data table 2 summarizes these test results in conclusion though the parametric iv method seems suitable in estimating the quadratic model it is outperformed by the semiparametric dynamic panel data framework introduced by this paper thanks to its generality from a methodological perspective our approach helps be more confident about assumptions on regressor endogeneity and misspecified functional forms finally our discussions about convergence in co2 emissions and existence of an ekc relationship between gdp and co2 emissions per capita will rely on the outcomes of the ivo and ivg estimators 6 2 estimation results we start by reporting the two semiparametric estimators for model 4 using w i t e y i t 1 z i t 1 as instrument for vit table 3 displays the results of the ivo and ivg estimators 18 18 results of iv estimates are reported in table 3 for comparison purposes we thank an anonymous reviewer for this suggestion globally our results suggest convergence in co2 emissions per capita given the estimated parameter for α lower than 1 and statistically significant for both the ivo and the ivg models comparable results of an overall ec appear among others in the recent studies by runar et al 2017 and rios and gianmoena 2018 respectively for a sample 124 and 141 countries observed over relatively long periods in particular α is equal to 0 769 in the case of the ivo estimator and 0 903 in the case of the ivg estimator leading to a convergence rate λ of 5 3 and 2 0 respectively compared to the ivg the ivo seems to overestimate the convergence speed or equivalently the ivg underestimates the convergence rate compared to the ivo however the latter is overestimated the most by the parametric iv model among all the parametric and semiparametric models considered 19 19 other parametric estimators except the iv i e re fe gmm give results of comparable magnitude see also appendices b and c for more details note that the convergence obtained here must be interpreted in terms of steady state convergence within the conditional convergence framework of equation 4 i e convergence towards country specific steady states as emphasized by islam 2003 20 20 we also dissociate the ekc and ec analysis and observed results very comparable to those of tre iv estimator see tables c1 c2 and c3 we thank an anonymous reviewer for this suggestion concerning the co2 emissions and gdp per capita nexus figure 6 displays the function g zit resulting from the two semiparametric estimators an increasing relationship is observed along the whole range of income despite a short decreasing path at the lower tail a similar increasing pattern has been recently observed in the contribution by nasr et al 2015 del pablo romero and dejesús 2016 and sarkodie 2018 with environmental indicators such as co2 energy use and ecological footprint overall this indicates that co2 emissions per capita keep rising not only in low and middle income countries but also at higher levels of gdp per capita i e in the very upper tail of the distribution this contrasts with the ekc hypothesis predicting a reduction of emissions for high income levels the shape of g is much similar for both the ivo and the ivg estimators the former having a steeper slope we observe that the slope of both curves becomes steeper for levels of log income higher than 10 which is exactly the opposite feature of an ekc globally relying on no ad hoc specification of the emissions income relationship the semiparametric analysis for the 106 developing and developed countries does not support the ekc hypothesis regarding ec our results show evidence of convergence in co2 emissions per capita combined with the distribution analysis in section 3 we can conclude that this convergence is rather towards higher emissions levels the result confirms the conjecture according to which the existence of an ekc can imply the ec but the reverse is not true it remains to check the robustness of our findings such an exercise can be performed by using data subsamples on oecd and non oecd countries the next section is devoted to that 7 subsample analysis 7 1 subsample analysis oecd versus non oecd countries as outlined in the introduction the theoretical ekc argument implies that we should observe a negative relationship between pollutant emissions and income in high income economies therefore replicating the above estimates for a subsample of oecd countries should provide evidence of either an ekc relationship or at least a deceleration of co2 emissions for high income levels in addition we should simultaneously find evidence of a convergence process as long as we consider a group of high income countries with similar structure of production implementing relatively environmentally friendly technologies and in which interventions targeting environmental degradation are in the policy agenda some empirical results support this view for instance galeotti et al 2006 which reports evidence of an inverted u shaped relationship for oecd countries while an increasing curve is found for non oecd economies indeed countries belonging to the oecd group are more likely to present the mechanisms triggering the ekc as discussed above we firstly estimate the semiparametric and parametric models for the subsample of the oecd economies then we compare the results with those obtained for non oecd countries oecd countries the results for the 21 oecd countries are reported in table 4 semiparametric estimates for α in the first two columns indicate that oecd countries are converging in terms of co2 emissions per capita the rate of convergence is about 3 6 in the ivo analysis while it is 1 1 in the ivg case and both are statistically significant though the iv model is outperformed by the semiparametric models ivo and ivg table 4 reports the output of the iv estimation for comparison purposes figure 7 plots the estimation of the relationship between emissions per capita and gdp per capita g z in the ivo as well as in ivg case since the confidence bands for both estimators are quite large we conclude that no empirical support for the ekc argument can be claimed overall our results for oecd countries do not support the ekc argument moreover the estimations above and distribution dynamics analysis in figure 5 indicate that environmental convergence is in place in terms of both convergence toward the country s steady state and relative emissions for oecd countries non oecd countries the results of the semiparametric analysis in table 5 first two columns suggest ec among non oecd countries since α is lower than 1 for both ivo and ivg estimators corresponding to significant convergence rates of 6 2 and 2 6 similar conclusions can be drawn from the parametric iv estimator which however overestimates the convergence rate 12 4 thus independently of the estimations procedure ec is also noticeable among non oecd countries regarding ekc similarly to the full sample case we do not find empirical support for the ekc hypothesis both the semiparametric curves g z as displayed in figure 8 are increasing along the whole income range overall our results for non oecd countries are very similar to those obtained for the full sample supporting ec while disproving the ekc hypothesis finally while increasing patterns between income per capita and co2 emissions appear in non oecd countries a flat relationship is observed in oecd countries regarding ec both sub sample show evidence of ec with a significantly higher convergence rate in non oecd countries hence this oecd versus non oecd analysis confirms the results obtained using the full sample namely ec in the presence of an ekc 7 2 subsample analysis high income versus low income countries in a further step of testing the sensitivity of our outcomes to income level and economic structure we assess ec and ekc decoupling high income countries hic from low income countries lic 21 21 we rely on sample median value of income per capita to dissociate hic and lic the results of this additional step reported in table 6 and figure 9 are largely coherent with the ones previously observed for the full sample more concretely our ivo and ivg estimators show a significant estimate for α implying a statistically significant convergence rate in both hic and lic regarding ekc our results display overall increasing patterns as noted above the evidence of ec concurrently with the non existence of an ekc is not surprising since the downward part of the ekc relationship is observable only if hic sufficiently curb down their emissions levels globally the results of our analysis for the full sample and the subsamples can be summarized as follows firstly even though we consider a sample large enough to satisfy the structural conditions likely to trigger the ekc effects we find no evidence of an inverted u shaped relationship between co2 emissions and income when considering the most preferred estimators ivo and ivg the estimations reveal an increasing pattern for the whole income range and no reversion occurs in the upper tail this implies that the ekc argument fails because rich economies did not sufficiently reduce their emissions such a pattern is confirmed by considering sub samples such as hic lic and even in the oecd countries secondly the evidence of ec supported by the distribution analysis and by both parametric and semiparametric specifications can be linked to the failure of the ekc argument indeed the relationship between co2 emissions and income together with the conditional densities in section 2 clearly show that emissions are converging towards high levels of emissions although the convergence speed is quite low its estimated range is 3 6 6 2 based on the ivo estimator and 1 1 2 6 based on the ivg one rich countries in particular oecd countries are not remarkably reducing their emissions yet 22 22 recalling again islam 2003 argument on the interpretation of a conditional convergence equation we may state that countries are converging towards their own steady states which do not need to coincide each other results in section 2 are consistent with this interpretation concretely the observed emissions convergence process does not appear as a result of an environmentally friendly change in economic activity but rather as a catching up phenomenon resulting from economic performances in low income countries 8 discussions the semiparametric dynamic panel data model noting that the mechanisms leading to ec are the same that favour ekc this paper introduces a unified framework to simultaneously assess ec and ekc contrary to existing literature where tests of the ec hypothesis ignore ekc and vice versa our paper fills this gap by proposing to link these two arguments certainly a parametric iv methodology can help estimate regression models together testing ec and ekc nevertheless the iv method still based on parametric specifications upon the data would probably be outperformed by more flexible specifications moreover the iv method can be misleading when testing nonlinear relationships such as the ekc hypotheses this is exactly why our proposed semiparametric dynamic panel data model with ivo and ivg estimators seems to be the most satisfactory approach to address ekc and ec within this unified framework ec in the absence of an ekc applying the unified empirical framework to ec and ekc we obtain results supporting the ec hypothesis while questioning the existence of ekc whether considering the full sample or subsamples hic lic and of oecd and non oecd countries overall our results strengthen conclusions of existing empirical studies on ec which report an ongoing catching up process among countries in terms of co2 emissions per capita this would also suggest that international agreements environmental conservation effort and economic instruments have contributed to slow down emissions per capita in industrialized countries enabling a global conditional convergence process the indications of decelerating environmental degradation with per capita income also observable in hic and lic proceed together with the absence of an ekc for co2 emissions this evidence of ec in the absence of an ekc has two major implications firstly despite raising question on the sustainable nature of ongoing development process these results remain encouraging as a flatten ekc relationship is still noticeable in oecd countries secondly although they successfully contribute to decelerating pollutant emissions international agreements and economic mechanisms remain insufficiently strong and binding enough to substantially curb down co2 emissions per capita in high income countries hence larger efforts are still needed especially in hic to achieve a sustainable development process implication for environmental policy our main results suggesting an ongoing ec in the absence of ekc has some implications for environmental policy firstly they encourage hic to further work toward a transition from fossil energies to less polluting energies in order to achieve the sustainable development goals sdg a low carbon development the energy transition will cause substantial decreases in pollutant emissions and favour the emergence of an ekc this policy implication also applies to oecd countries although the relation co2 emissions income show a relatively flat behaviour a significant reduction in emissions is still very feasible in oecd countries as theoretically suggested by figure 1 secondly our results invite lic and middle income countries to promote investments in green and renewable energies supply as well as in energy efficient technologies contrary to the hic these actions may ensure in lic an economic transition to post industrial stages with low carbon levels and relatively low environmental impacts 9 concluding remarks this paper aims to merge empirical literature on environmental convergence and kuznets curve hypothesis arguing that the two perspectives are genuinely related it therefore proposes a unified empirical framework simultaneously testing ec and ekc relying on a semiparametric dynamic panel data model which also accounts for regressor endogeneity applying the so called unified empirical framework to a panel data sample of 106 countries observed between 1970 to 2015 delivers very insightful outcomes on the co2 emissions and income nexus globally our results mainly based on an instrumental variable estimator for semiparametric dynamic panel model do not support the existence of an inverted u shaped relationship between co2 emissions and gdp per capita on the opposite an increasing path is observed although the relation flattens for lower high income levels our results which are robust across both subsamples of oecd versus non oecd countries and lic versus hic provide clear evidence of convergence in co2 emissions this convergence can be reconciled with the absence of an ekc relationship as economies converge towards their steady states with high levels of co2 emissions consequently we can state that although their promising impacts on the reduction of emissions notably in rich countries international efforts and agreements aiming to reduce the global environmental impact of economic activities need to be intensified in order to invert the increasing relationship between economic growth and greenhouse co2 emissions such conclusions are relevant especially because they also hold for oecd countries indeed the overall relationship between co2 emissions and income remains increasing although it slightly flattens at high income levels despite existing international agreements the tertiarization of output structure technological advance economic incentives for environmentally friendly technologies of production from a policy point of view such evidence weakens the ability of rich economies and international institutions to effectively implement pro environmental policies in developing countries and raises serious concerns about the sustainability of the current development process the present study can be extended and replicated in various ways for instance by applying the analysis using different environmental indicators it may be of interest to further augment the main specification to investigate the role of determinants of co2 emissions and other environmental indicators in particular two kinds of factors could deserve special attention technological advance and policy measures this is left to future research credit authorship

respectively in both cases α the estimated coefficient for y i t 1 is less than 1 and significant implying convergence rates of 8 and 3 respectively regarding the relationship between emissions and

24734,existing studies disjointly addressed the environmental convergence and environmental kuznets curve hypotheses though these research lines are theoretically interconnected this paper proposes a unified empirical methodology to simultaneously investigate both hypotheses relying on a semiparametric dynamic panel data model that accounts for regressor endogeneity the approach when applied to co2 emissions in 106 countries suggests that there is no global level evidence supporting the environmental kuznets hypothesis while a convergence process is taking place our results imply that current international agreements have not been sufficiently binding to globally curb co2 emissions especially in high income countries as aimed by sustainable development goals keywords environmental kuznets curve environmental convergence co2 emissions regressor endogeneity semiparametric panel data model 1 introduction this paper proposes a unified framework bridging two lines of empirical literature in environmental and ecological economics the environmental convergence ec and the environmental kuznets curve ekc hypotheses the ekc argument states that environmental degradation increases with income until a turning point after which it decreases depicting an inverted u shaped curve as in figure 1 ec occurs if countries with low emissions of pollutants per capita increase their level of emissions while the opposite applies to high emissions countries leading to a catch up in pollutants emissions per capita indeed the ekc hypothesis holds if the richest and most polluting countries reduce their emissions as long as this is true the process of economic growth undertaken by poorer and developing countries will get their level of emissions per capita closer to that of developed economies this is also what a convergence process implies nguyen van 2005 strazicich and list 2003 1 1 however convergence can take place even if high polluting economies do not reduce their emissions for instance low emissions countries could increase their pollutant impact and fill the gap with the most polluting economies in such a case countries would be converging to a high level of emissions thus the two lines of research are theoretically related and are worth a unified empirical treatment though the interconnection between these two topics existing empirical studies so far discuss the ekc and ec hypotheses in separate frameworks this has been the case among others in the studies by galeotti et al 2006 nasr et al 2015 and apergis 2016 for the ekc analysis and in mohammadi and ram 2012 and criado and grether 2011 for ec from a policy perspective evidence of ec together with an ekc relationship would have two consequences firstly it may ensure sustainability of the economic growth process secondly it would make global agreements targeting the reduction of pollutants or greenhouse gas ghg emissions politically feasible as developing countries would be encouraged to accept a cap on their emissions without fearing serious consequences for economic growth romero ávila 2008 our paper s contribution to the existing literature is twofold firstly it introduces a novel and robust unified empirical framework a semiparametric dynamic panel data model relating the ekc argument to ec secondly it relies on the latter unified framework to simultaneously investigate i whether the current growth process is sustainable and ii whether the existing global agreements are sufficiently efficient in reducing ghg emissions this paper therefore brings together economic and policy discussions from two empirical strands into a unified framework which accounts for misspecification biases related to functional form and or regressor endogeneity it must be highlighted that the scope of the application to co2 emissions data in this paper is neither to investigate their determinants nor to determine the ceteris paribus impact of income on co2 emissions 2 2 that is to say we do not provide a list of additional regressors in order to explain emissions as remarked by azomahou et al 2006 it would be difficult to include all the relevant factors and any choice would be rather arbitrary see kang et al 2016 and wang et al 2016 etc for an exercise in that direction by additionally accounting for spatial effects while he and wang 2012 baek 2015 and apergis and ozturk 2015 among others depart from the standard ekc regression by including the role of other factors such as economic structure energy use population institutional quality etc in shaping ghg emissions our concern is rather the provision of a robust long run relationship between ghg emissions and income together with the assessment of the existence of an ec process with our data by doing so we will be able to discuss whether a sustainable growth process is in place whether groups of economies are converging in terms of co2 emissions and which levels of emissions the economies are actually converging to the paper proceeds as follows section 2 overviews the related literature section 3 presents the data and investigates distribution dynamics of co2 emissions per capita following the approach originally proposed by quah 1996 section 4 describes the econometric specification in section 5 we present the results for the semiparametric specification as well as for several parametric estimators in section 6 we distinguish between oecd and non oecd economies and we perform some robustness checks within the traditional parametric estimators and compare them with the semiparametric specifications section 7 concludes the analysis 2 linking the ekc and the ec hypotheses theoretically the ekc relationship between environmental degradation and income per capita figure 1 is triggered by three mechanisms panayotou 1993 stern 2004 firstly the composition of output determines the environmental impact of economic activities hence economies mostly specialized in agricultural production or tertiary activities pollute less than economies relying mostly on manufacturing production it follows that the ekc is strictly linked to the transition from a manufacturing to a service based economy since the tertiarization of the economy favours changes in the input mix which becomes less environmentally damaging marsiglio et al 2016 secondly technological advance may promote the adoption of the above mentioned changes in the input mix as well as the diffusion of less polluting techniques of production favouring energy efficiency stern 2004 turner and hanley 2011 finally changes in individual preferences together with regulation and enforcement contribute to increasing supply and demand for environmentally friendly goods and services 3 3 this perspective however has some critics arrow et al 1995 and stern et al 1996 noted that the process is mainly driven by the reallocation of polluting economic activities from developed to developing countries while dasgupta et al 2002 noted that the argument does not apply to every pollutant ec theoretically implies that environmental degradation in per capita occurs faster in pre industrial economies than in post industrial economies leading to a catch up phenomenon among countries regarding co2 emissions several mechanisms engender ec primarily while international agreements kyoto protocol establish emission goals for high income economies no commitments exist for developing countries furthermore as noted by requate 2005 and vine and hamrin 2008 economic instruments such price based carbon taxes and rights based measures drive reduction of emissions in industrialized countries in addition to tertiarization of the economy and technological advance these mechanisms while slowing down environmental degradation in high income countries favour growing co2 emissions in low income countries payne 2020 relating the ekc and ec hypotheses the only existing theoretical study we have identified is the work by brock and taylor 2010 these authors proposed a green solow model where the ekc appears as a by product of the convergence process to a sustainable growth path their model predicts a conditional convergence of pollutant emissions similarly to the concept of conditional income convergence brock and taylor 2010 made the observation that the mechanisms leading to income growth and convergence are also at the origin of the ekc and the ec this is particularly relevant when international agreement and economic instruments are sufficiently strong enough to flatten and then significantly curb down co2 emissions in high income countries thus even in case where substantial decreases in emissions a notable downward trend do not occur in high income countries as depicted by figure 1 ec a catch up remains possible as long as industrialized countries decelerate environmental degradation while pre industrial countries do not therefore based on this discussion we can make the conjecture that the existence of an ekc can imply conditional environmental convergence similarly to the case of income convergence however the reverse would not be true i e the existence of conditional ec is not sufficient to ensure the emergence of an ekc relationship as illustrated by figure 2 our study proposes a novel empirical approach which will be detailed below to test this conjecture which has never been tested so far 3 related ekc and ec literature 3 1 the ekc literature investigating the ekc hypothesis traces back to the nineties following the leading studies by bank 1992 shafik and bandyopadhyay 1992 grossman and krueger 1993 1995 and panayotou 1993 among others empirical analyses of the ekc hypothesis abound in the literature 4 4 this review does not cover studies on granger causality between energy and growth as our paper is about a different topic various environmental degradation indicators have been examined emissions or concentrations of pollutants co co2 so2 no x among others deforestation rate water quality etc the standard approach adopts a parametric specification in which the environmental indicator in per capita is regressed on income per capita as a linear quadratic and also cubic function results vary according to the environmental indicator and the data sample under analysis for instance suri and chapman 1998 used parametric panel models finding that the relationship between energy consumption and income displays an increasing pattern with turning point outside the data sample richmond and kaufmann 2006a b by using parametric specifications for panel data found little evidence of an ekc for energy consumption which increases with income at a decreasing rate the study of özokcu and özdemir 2017 based on panel data estimation did not give any empirical support to the ekc neither for oecd countries nor for a sample of 52 emerging countries observed over the period 1980 2010 in addition based on a spatial and panel gmm analysis wang et al 2016 wang and he 2019 found no support for an ekc for co2 emissions in chinese provinces and regions for the period 1995 2013 the panel data study performed by del pablo romero and dejesús 2016 did not either support the ekc hypothesis for 22 countries in latin america and the caribbean for the period 1990 2011 on the contrary apergis and ozturk 2015 applying a parametric gmm model to a panel data of 14 asian countries found evidence of an ekc for co2 emissions similarly to sarkodie and strezov 2019 on the sample of 17 african countries observed between 1971 and 2013 it is to observe that existing parametric models are based on relatively restricted assumptions dijkgraaf and vollebergh 2005 cast doubt on the ekc results based on parametric panel data models by pointing out the weakness of the parameters homogeneity assumption underlying these models similar results are obtained by hettige et al 2000 heil and selden 2001 and bertinelli and strobl 2005 for different indicators while evidence of an inverted u shaped relationship was obtained by shafik 1994 and schmalensee et al 1998 etc more recently semi and non parametric techniques have been implemented to investigate the validity of the ekc hypothesis the advantage of such an approach is that semi and non parametric estimations do not require the specification of an ad hoc functional form however even in such a case empirical results are still not univocal and vary with the sample and the indicator used for instance nguyen van 2010 found no evidence of an ekc for energy consumption using semiparametric techniques applied on a panel of countries while a similar result was obtained by nasr et al 2015 for south africa a carbon intensive and non oil producing developing country differently sephton and mann 2013 and apergis 2016 provided empirical support for the ekc hypothesis in the case of spain and for 12 countries respectively 5 5 see stern 2004 azomahou et al 2006 kijima et al 2010 and bo 2011 for a more detailed review on non parametric ekc studies as the purpose of our paper is not to systematically review the ekc literature we only report some existing papers to motivate our approach other papers can be found in previous issues of journals in the field like ecological indicators energy economics and renewable and sustainable energy reviews which can give more insights on parametric and non parametric investigations on the ekc hypothesis using panel or time series data on various environmental indicators recently shahbaz et al 2017 revisited the co2 emissions income nexus for g7 countries by combining non parametric and time series techniques using historical data covering the period 1820 2015 the authors showed evidence of ekc for almost every country in the g7 except japan moreover mixed results appear in the studies by ansari et al 2020 kacprzyk and kuchta 2020 sarkodie and strezov 2019 and altıntaş and kassouri 2020 while the meta analysis by sarkodie and strezov 2019 leads to blurred conclusions regarding the existence of an ekc it is noted that differences in time span econometric specifications estimation methods and in indicators justify the results disparity thus kacprzyk and kuchta 2020 and altıntaş and kassouri 2020 respectively using data samples on 161 countries observed between 1992 2012 and 14 countries observed between 1991 2014 find results indicating that ekc also depends on environmental and development indicators in conclusion it is to observe that independently on environmental indicators econometric specification and data sample existing studies overlooked the interconnection between ekc and ec 3 2 the ec literature environmental convergence has been a prolific subject of empirical studies following methodologies used in the economic growth literature hence the topic has been investigated in terms of β convergence using cross sectional analysis as in strazicich and list 2003 mohammadi and ram 2012 and brock and taylor 2010 among others panel data models see e g nguyen van 2005 miketa and mulder 2005 mulder and de groot 2007 panopoulou and pantelidis 2009 criado et al 2011 camarero et al 2013 distribution dynamics techniques for instance in nguyen van 2005 aldy 2006 criado and grether 2011 criado et al 2011 bassetti et al 2013 or time series approach e g strazicich and list 2003 6 6 see pettersson et al 2014 for a survey on environmental convergence studies however less attention has been devoted to the link between the ekc hypothesis and ec in particular accounting for the implications described above even though in some cases the standard ekc equation has been transformed in a dynamic setting by adding lagged emissions among the regressors there is no explicit argument relative to convergence this has been done mainly to justify a persistent behaviour in emissions this is the case for example of agras and chapman 1999 bernard et al 2015 lee et al 2009 in which no reference to the ec was made 7 7 for example lee et al 2009 estimate the convergence equation in levels rather than in logs which would be required to keep consistency with a standard convergence model see islam 2003 theoretically some specific models for ec in an ekc framework were given by bulte et al 2007 and brock and taylor 2010 which build on the solow model assuming that pollution occurs as a by product of economic activity and it can be reduced through abatement efforts in a slightly different vein criado et al 2011 adopted a a ramsey cass koopmans model without referring to the ekc hypothesis to provide theoretical support and empirical evidence for ec such a theoretical background and the lack of an empirical strategy clearly addressing together convergence and the ekc motivate the present study im recent literature researchers have been considering in addition to co2 emissions environmental indicators such emissions and energy intensities as well as eco efficiency index in addressing ec among others this has been the case in the study by apergis and payne 2017 camarero et al 2013 zhao et al 2015 and yu et al 2019 relying on eco efficiency indicators obtained by data envelopment camarero et al 2013 assess ec to find results suggesting the existence of 4 convergence clubs across oecd countries comparable results appear in the study by barassi et al 2018 for 28 oecd countries stochastic convergence and by zhao et al 2015 and apergis and payne 2017 respectively in 30 chinese provinces and 50 us states finally considering co2 and energy intensity in value added fernández amador et al 2019 and apergis et al 2020 also investigate the ec hypothesis the primer using a conditional β approach on the sample of 66 countries and 12 regions provide evidence supporting slower global convergence in addition to country specific conditional convergence the latter on a sample of 6 central america countries mainly conclude for the existence of 2 convergence clubs overall contrary to ekc studies where depending on samples model specifications and estimation procedures discordant results are observed it is to note that studies on ec seem less divergent whether the framework is β σ or stochastic convergence nevertheless as mentioned above existing studies so far lack of a framework linking ekc to ec in what follows we propose a unique framework to concurrently assess the occurrence of both the ekc hypothesis and ec using co2 emissions as an illustrative application since it is a major greenhouse gas and closely linked to energy consumption and economic activity the estimation relies on the panel data model proposed by li and stengos 1996 baltagi and li 2002 and li and racine 2007 this approach has two interesting aspects firstly it allows for a dynamic structure capturing some habits or persistence behaviour in co2 emissions since emissions cuts might take time indeed the literature has shown that adoption of energy saving technologies is costly and that diffusion of these technologies is a lengthy process jaffe and stavins 1994 mulder et al 2003 moreover and most important for our purposes such a dynamic setting can be used to test for convergence following the panel solution provided by islam 1995 in the spirit of a theoretical framework in line with bulte et al 2007 and brock and taylor 2010 secondly our model includes a non parametric function of income which allows us to avoid possible misspecified functional forms that might affect parametric ekc studies azomahou et al 2006 bertinelli and strobl 2005 4 data and distribution dynamics 4 1 data we use co2 emissions per capita in kiloton of oil equivalent drawn from the world development indicators this corresponds to carbon dioxide emissions stemming from the burning of fossil fuels and the manufacture of cement co2 emissions are then strictly linked to production and economic activity in general gdp per capita output side real gdp is instead drawn from the penn world table 9 0 and expressed in ppp of 2011 the sample includes 106 countries which greatly differ in gdp per capita over the period 1970 2015 we also focus the analysis on two subsamples consisting of 21 oecd and 85 non oecd economies to assess potential heterogeneities between developed and developing countries table 1 reports the descriptive statistics the high value of the standard deviation for both gdp and co2 emissions per capita is indicative of the heterogeneity of the sample the very high maximum value for gdp per capita corresponds to saudi arabia in 1973 similar high values are also observed for bahrain especially in the seventies the highest value of co2 emissions per capita corresponds to bahamas in which consumption of liquid fuels more than doubled in the seventies for then reverting to the previous trend in the eighties overall higher levels of co2 per capita are observed in the oil countries included in the sample bahrain and saudi arabia and also in luxembourg and the united states complementary to table 1 figure 3 reports the kernel density estimates values are standardized with respect to the mean i e relative values the distribution of co2 and gdp per capita is reported for the waves 1975 1995 and 2015 and the pattern is similar in both cases the proportion of countries at the bottom of the distribution is decreasing over time while the mass increases in the interval 1 3 favouring a bimodal distribution in the case of gdp per capita this implies that the average levels of gdp and co2 are increasing over time underlying that co2 is a by product of economic activity 4 2 distribution dynamics convergence analysis in growth econometrics is usually done by either estimating a convergence equation using cross sectional data panel data or time series however the estimation results provide information regarding the average behaviour in the sample and no relevant insights are given with respect to relative performances of the entire sample distribution hence the analysis of distribution dynamics is a complementary tool providing a complete picture of co2 emissions quah 1996 1997 in particular we study the evolution of the distribution of co2 emissions assuming that the process determining its dynamics is time invariant and first order johnson 2000 2005 so that the distribution prevailing at time t τ is given by 1 ϕ t τ y 0 f τ y x ϕ t x d x where x and y are relative co2 emissions per capita i e standardized with mean value at time t and t τ respectively function ϕt x corresponds to the distribution of emissions at time t finally fτ y x is the conditional density that informs about transition dynamics within the distribution during the period considered mapping the position of each country at time t and t τ 8 8 the conditional density represents the continuous analogue of the transition matrix see johnson 2000 2005 and nguyen van 2005 for estimation details figure 4 plots fτ y x for which τ 5 hence considering data for 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 9 9 results obtained with τ 10 are very similar observations that did not change their relative position from t to t τ lie on the 45 degrees line observations below the 45 degrees line improved their relative position along the period i e relative emissions increase in t τ conditionally to information in t while observations above fell behind i e relative emissions decrease in t τ the density contours and the dotted line which is the median curve plotted in figure 4 show that observations of the distribution are stable over time notably for observations between the range 0 5 1 5 the observed peak for values close to 0 is below the 45 degrees line indicating an improvement of their relative positions in the distribution overall the picture shows a convergence pattern for low emitting countries towards higher emission values whereas the relative positions of high emitting countries remain stable over time higher levels of co2 emissions are usually observed in high income countries because of the output structure largely relying on fossil energy use simultaneously these countries are the most engaged in policies to reduce the environmental impact of economic activity and to exploit alternative energy sources taking into account this heterogeneity related to high income countries we perform the above analysis for the subsample of 21 oecd countries figure 5 plots the resulting conditional density the contours indicate that contrary to the full sample distribution dynamics are characterized by higher mobility two main peaks can be detected one of them between 0 5 and 1 below the 45 degrees line suggesting an increase in emissions for low emitting countries another peak in the upper tail around 2 of the distribution is mostly located above the 45 degrees line suggesting a reduction of emissions for high emitting countries hence this suggests a bi polarization process among oecd countries but with a convergence for the whole oecd countries such evidence is consistent with findings for industrial countries reported by nguyen van 2005 and strazicich and list 2003 5 the econometric model to complete the previous distribution analysis we propose a framework to study the nexus between income and an environmental indicator the latter corresponds to co2 emissions for our illustrative application following the definition of income convergence in the panel data framework proposed by islam 1995 we can model convergence for environmental indicator y or co2 emissions per capita as follows 2 y i t α y i t 1 ζ i t where yit is the log of co2 emissions per capita of country i i 1 n at period t t 1 t the equation allows capturing the local dynamics toward the steady state more generally it accounts for adjustment dynamics of emissions over time if α is less than 1 pollutants in time t 1 are a smaller proportion of the level in t it should be noted that in equation 2 α exp λ τ where λ and τ respectively indicate the rate of convergence and the time span the former measures how fast emissions are converging to their steady state or more generally how fast the gap between countries is being closed 10 10 islam 2003 remarked the tension between the neoclassical and the general interpretation of the convergence parameters α and λ this tension arises whenever additional regressors other than the lagged dependent variable are considered in such a case if the neoclassical derivation of equation 2 is considered convergence towards each economy s steady state and the reduction of cross countries gaps do not longer coincide the smaller α the larger the rate of convergence λ when an estimation of α is available we can use the delta method to recover λ islam 2003 the time span between t and t 1 may be fixed to a period of several years following islam 1995 we opt for 5 years time intervals in order to avoid short term disturbances or business cycle fluctuations which are likely present in shorter periods hence as in the previous analysis about distribution dynamics the data used in the regressions below correspond to 1970 1975 2015 regarding the co2 emissions gdp nexus ekc literature existing studies usually assume the following parametric specification for an environmental indicator y and income z in logs y i t z i t β η i t often relying on a quadratic form in income z i t β β 0 β 1 z i t β 2 z i t 2 our methodological novelty involves gathering these two analytical perspectives into a single equation specification which allows for investigating both the ekc and the ec hypotheses 11 11 as stated the scope of this study is to investigate the long run relation between co2 emission and gdp it does not investigate the determinants of co2 emissions nor determine the ceteris paribus effect of gdp 3 y i t α y i t 1 z i t β ε i t we assume that the data are independent across the i index it is also assumed that the residuals in model 3 are given by ε i t μ i u i t where μi represents the country specific effect and uit the usual error term moreover our analysis is based on the case of large n and fixed t it should be noted that this model can be estimated by using divers approaches random effects gls estimator fixed effects within estimator instrumental variables iv however the presence of the lagged dependent variable y i t 1 implies a correlation between it and the regression residuals which makes the re gls and the fe within estimators inconsistent and then justifies the use of the iv estimator 12 12 the parametric model can be also estimated using the gmm estimators developed by arellano and bond 1991 arellano and bover 1995 and blundell and bond 1998 which work under the assumption that y i t 1 and zit are weakly exogenous or predetermined i e e u i t y i t 1 s e u i t z i s 0 s t gmm estimates not reported here however provide mixed results recent studies underline the possible misspecification regarding the parametric form of the ekc azomahou et al 2006 bertinelli and strobl 2005 taking this into account we replace the parametric function z i t β by a non parametric form g zit which does not require any ad doc functional form the resulting specification is the semiparametric dynamic panel data model 4 4 y i t α y i t 1 g z i t ε i t with ε i t μ i u i t the model includes the situation where μi are considered as random effects the case of fixed effects μi is interesting but much more complex to handle 13 13 this issue would deserve to be studied in a further work moreover the model covers the case e u i t z i s 0 s t which is much more general than the assumption e u i t z i s 0 s t usually adopted in existing parametric settings estimation of model in 4 can be performed following the methods developed by li and stengos 1996 baltagi and li 2002 and li and racine 2007 these authors proposed two instrumental variable solutions for estimating α which also allow for the assumption that the residuals ε it are serially correlated following this procedure we firstly eliminate g zit as in robinson 1988 by taking the expectation of 4 conditional on zit and then by subtracting it from 4 this yields 5 y i t e y i t z i t α y i t 1 e y i t 1 z i t ε i t e ε i t z i t α v i t ξ i t where v i t y i t 1 e y i t 1 z i t and ξ i t ε i t e ε i t z i t if we use e ε i t z i t 0 then ξ i t ε i t following li and stengos 1996 and baltagi and li 2002 assuming there exists q 1 instrumental variables wit which are correlated with y i t 1 and uncorrelated with ξit the instrumental variable estimators are given by 6 α i v o v w w v 1 v w w y ψ 7 α i v g v σ 1 w w σ 1 w 1 w σ 1 v 1 v σ 1 w w σ 1 w 1 w σ 1 y e y i t z i t where ψit e yit zit note that estimator 6 is computed using ols while estimator 7 relies on gls using wit as an instrument moreover the ivo estimator requires wit to be weakly exogenous while the ivg requires strong exogeneity of the instrument and conditional homoskedasticity of the residuals li and stengos 1996 used w i t z i t 1 as an iv for v i t y i t 1 e y i t 1 z i t because z i t 1 is uncorrelated with ξit and it is possibly correlated with vit however baltagi and li 2002 showed that in some cases e v i t z i t 1 0 so that w i t z i t 1 is uncorrelated with vit 14 14 see baltagi and li 2002 for more details to avoid this possibility they proposed to use w i t e y i t 1 z i t 1 instead of z i t 1 as an instrument for vit this is the approach we follow it should be noted that these conditional expectations in estimations are replaced by the non parametric kernel estimators i e w i t i t n t k z i t y i t 1 i t n t k z i t where k is the kernel function in addition we use bootstrap procedures to get consistent estimates of standard errors when an estimator of α is available g can be non parametrically estimated by applying the kernel regression to equation 3 g z i t e y i t α y i t 1 z i t 15 15 the analysis would account for series nonstationarity if the time dimension t was high in the empirical application as performed below as we focus on the long run relationship between variables by using observations corresponding to five years periods thus t 10 in order to eliminate business cycle effects our estimation is then less concerned by this issue there exist very numerous ekc studies based on time series for more details on them one can refer to e g bölük and mert 2015 benjebli et al 2016 benyoussef et al 2016 apergis et al 2017 liu et al 2017 and zoundi 2017 to name just a few a further piece of information concerns the appropriateness of the functional form indeed it may be interesting to test whether the parametric functional form is a good approximation therefore we apply the procedure developed by henderson et al 2008 to test the parametric dynamic panel data model in 3 against the semiparametric dynamic panel data model in 4 the test statistic is given by 8 i n 1 n t i n t t α y i t 1 z i t β α y i t 1 g z i t 2 where α and β denote the consistent estimators based on model 3 and α and g are consistent estimators based on 4 the h 0 hypothesis corresponds to the parametric model 3 while the alternative h 1 is the semiparametric specification 4 note that in converges to zero in probability under the null and it converges to a positive constant under the alternative however the asymptotic distribution of in is unknown therefore henderson et al 2008 employed a bootstrap procedure to generate an empirical distribution for in which approximates its finite sample null distribution hence our inference is done by calculating such an empirical distribution 16 16 the bootstrap procedure generates r new samples of y i t according to the parametric model then both models 3 and 4 are estimated r times and the respective coefficients are obtained for further details see henderson et al 2008 6 estimation results 6 1 specification tests at a first step we compare various parametric models hausman test tests results are reported in table e1 overall the random effect estimator is rejected in favour of a fe specification also the iv estimator which takes the endogeneity of y i t 1 into account outperforms the fe within estimator 17 17 see appendix c for more details on the test results and the re and fe estimations at a second step though the semiparametric models have the advantage of imposing no ad hoc parametric functional form their results could be compared to those of a parametric specification in what follows we perform further specification tests using the henderson et al 2008 comparing the semiparametric counterpart among then and also to the iv estimator in order to find the most reasonable approximation to the data applying the test of henderson et al 2008 we compare the iv parametric model to both the ivo and ivg semiparametric models the null hypothesis being that the iv estimator is preferred the test statistics for the whole sample case are respectively 6 233 and 6 140 for the ivo and ivg alternatives compared to the semiparametric models the test results reject the iv estimator replicating the test for the oecd and non oecd subsamples provides very comparable results hence both the ivo and the ivg appear to be good fits for our data table 2 summarizes these test results in conclusion though the parametric iv method seems suitable in estimating the quadratic model it is outperformed by the semiparametric dynamic panel data framework introduced by this paper thanks to its generality from a methodological perspective our approach helps be more confident about assumptions on regressor endogeneity and misspecified functional forms finally our discussions about convergence in co2 emissions and existence of an ekc relationship between gdp and co2 emissions per capita will rely on the outcomes of the ivo and ivg estimators 6 2 estimation results we start by reporting the two semiparametric estimators for model 4 using w i t e y i t 1 z i t 1 as instrument for vit table 3 displays the results of the ivo and ivg estimators 18 18 results of iv estimates are reported in table 3 for comparison purposes we thank an anonymous reviewer for this suggestion globally our results suggest convergence in co2 emissions per capita given the estimated parameter for α lower than 1 and statistically significant for both the ivo and the ivg models comparable results of an overall ec appear among others in the recent studies by runar et al 2017 and rios and gianmoena 2018 respectively for a sample 124 and 141 countries observed over relatively long periods in particular α is equal to 0 769 in the case of the ivo estimator and 0 903 in the case of the ivg estimator leading to a convergence rate λ of 5 3 and 2 0 respectively compared to the ivg the ivo seems to overestimate the convergence speed or equivalently the ivg underestimates the convergence rate compared to the ivo however the latter is overestimated the most by the parametric iv model among all the parametric and semiparametric models considered 19 19 other parametric estimators except the iv i e re fe gmm give results of comparable magnitude see also appendices b and c for more details note that the convergence obtained here must be interpreted in terms of steady state convergence within the conditional convergence framework of equation 4 i e convergence towards country specific steady states as emphasized by islam 2003 20 20 we also dissociate the ekc and ec analysis and observed results very comparable to those of tre iv estimator see tables c1 c2 and c3 we thank an anonymous reviewer for this suggestion concerning the co2 emissions and gdp per capita nexus figure 6 displays the function g zit resulting from the two semiparametric estimators an increasing relationship is observed along the whole range of income despite a short decreasing path at the lower tail a similar increasing pattern has been recently observed in the contribution by nasr et al 2015 del pablo romero and dejesús 2016 and sarkodie 2018 with environmental indicators such as co2 energy use and ecological footprint overall this indicates that co2 emissions per capita keep rising not only in low and middle income countries but also at higher levels of gdp per capita i e in the very upper tail of the distribution this contrasts with the ekc hypothesis predicting a reduction of emissions for high income levels the shape of g is much similar for both the ivo and the ivg estimators the former having a steeper slope we observe that the slope of both curves becomes steeper for levels of log income higher than 10 which is exactly the opposite feature of an ekc globally relying on no ad hoc specification of the emissions income relationship the semiparametric analysis for the 106 developing and developed countries does not support the ekc hypothesis regarding ec our results show evidence of convergence in co2 emissions per capita combined with the distribution analysis in section 3 we can conclude that this convergence is rather towards higher emissions levels the result confirms the conjecture according to which the existence of an ekc can imply the ec but the reverse is not true it remains to check the robustness of our findings such an exercise can be performed by using data subsamples on oecd and non oecd countries the next section is devoted to that 7 subsample analysis 7 1 subsample analysis oecd versus non oecd countries as outlined in the introduction the theoretical ekc argument implies that we should observe a negative relationship between pollutant emissions and income in high income economies therefore replicating the above estimates for a subsample of oecd countries should provide evidence of either an ekc relationship or at least a deceleration of co2 emissions for high income levels in addition we should simultaneously find evidence of a convergence process as long as we consider a group of high income countries with similar structure of production implementing relatively environmentally friendly technologies and in which interventions targeting environmental degradation are in the policy agenda some empirical results support this view for instance galeotti et al 2006 which reports evidence of an inverted u shaped relationship for oecd countries while an increasing curve is found for non oecd economies indeed countries belonging to the oecd group are more likely to present the mechanisms triggering the ekc as discussed above we firstly estimate the semiparametric and parametric models for the subsample of the oecd economies then we compare the results with those obtained for non oecd countries oecd countries the results for the 21 oecd countries are reported in table 4 semiparametric estimates for α in the first two columns indicate that oecd countries are converging in terms of co2 emissions per capita the rate of convergence is about 3 6 in the ivo analysis while it is 1 1 in the ivg case and both are statistically significant though the iv model is outperformed by the semiparametric models ivo and ivg table 4 reports the output of the iv estimation for comparison purposes figure 7 plots the estimation of the relationship between emissions per capita and gdp per capita g z in the ivo as well as in ivg case since the confidence bands for both estimators are quite large we conclude that no empirical support for the ekc argument can be claimed overall our results for oecd countries do not support the ekc argument moreover the estimations above and distribution dynamics analysis in figure 5 indicate that environmental convergence is in place in terms of both convergence toward the country s steady state and relative emissions for oecd countries non oecd countries the results of the semiparametric analysis in table 5 first two columns suggest ec among non oecd countries since α is lower than 1 for both ivo and ivg estimators corresponding to significant convergence rates of 6 2 and 2 6 similar conclusions can be drawn from the parametric iv estimator which however overestimates the convergence rate 12 4 thus independently of the estimations procedure ec is also noticeable among non oecd countries regarding ekc similarly to the full sample case we do not find empirical support for the ekc hypothesis both the semiparametric curves g z as displayed in figure 8 are increasing along the whole income range overall our results for non oecd countries are very similar to those obtained for the full sample supporting ec while disproving the ekc hypothesis finally while increasing patterns between income per capita and co2 emissions appear in non oecd countries a flat relationship is observed in oecd countries regarding ec both sub sample show evidence of ec with a significantly higher convergence rate in non oecd countries hence this oecd versus non oecd analysis confirms the results obtained using the full sample namely ec in the presence of an ekc 7 2 subsample analysis high income versus low income countries in a further step of testing the sensitivity of our outcomes to income level and economic structure we assess ec and ekc decoupling high income countries hic from low income countries lic 21 21 we rely on sample median value of income per capita to dissociate hic and lic the results of this additional step reported in table 6 and figure 9 are largely coherent with the ones previously observed for the full sample more concretely our ivo and ivg estimators show a significant estimate for α implying a statistically significant convergence rate in both hic and lic regarding ekc our results display overall increasing patterns as noted above the evidence of ec concurrently with the non existence of an ekc is not surprising since the downward part of the ekc relationship is observable only if hic sufficiently curb down their emissions levels globally the results of our analysis for the full sample and the subsamples can be summarized as follows firstly even though we consider a sample large enough to satisfy the structural conditions likely to trigger the ekc effects we find no evidence of an inverted u shaped relationship between co2 emissions and income when considering the most preferred estimators ivo and ivg the estimations reveal an increasing pattern for the whole income range and no reversion occurs in the upper tail this implies that the ekc argument fails because rich economies did not sufficiently reduce their emissions such a pattern is confirmed by considering sub samples such as hic lic and even in the oecd countries secondly the evidence of ec supported by the distribution analysis and by both parametric and semiparametric specifications can be linked to the failure of the ekc argument indeed the relationship between co2 emissions and income together with the conditional densities in section 2 clearly show that emissions are converging towards high levels of emissions although the convergence speed is quite low its estimated range is 3 6 6 2 based on the ivo estimator and 1 1 2 6 based on the ivg one rich countries in particular oecd countries are not remarkably reducing their emissions yet 22 22 recalling again islam 2003 argument on the interpretation of a conditional convergence equation we may state that countries are converging towards their own steady states which do not need to coincide each other results in section 2 are consistent with this interpretation concretely the observed emissions convergence process does not appear as a result of an environmentally friendly change in economic activity but rather as a catching up phenomenon resulting from economic performances in low income countries 8 discussions the semiparametric dynamic panel data model noting that the mechanisms leading to ec are the same that favour ekc this paper introduces a unified framework to simultaneously assess ec and ekc contrary to existing literature where tests of the ec hypothesis ignore ekc and vice versa our paper fills this gap by proposing to link these two arguments certainly a parametric iv methodology can help estimate regression models together testing ec and ekc nevertheless the iv method still based on parametric specifications upon the data would probably be outperformed by more flexible specifications moreover the iv method can be misleading when testing nonlinear relationships such as the ekc hypotheses this is exactly why our proposed semiparametric dynamic panel data model with ivo and ivg estimators seems to be the most satisfactory approach to address ekc and ec within this unified framework ec in the absence of an ekc applying the unified empirical framework to ec and ekc we obtain results supporting the ec hypothesis while questioning the existence of ekc whether considering the full sample or subsamples hic lic and of oecd and non oecd countries overall our results strengthen conclusions of existing empirical studies on ec which report an ongoing catching up process among countries in terms of co2 emissions per capita this would also suggest that international agreements environmental conservation effort and economic instruments have contributed to slow down emissions per capita in industrialized countries enabling a global conditional convergence process the indications of decelerating environmental degradation with per capita income also observable in hic and lic proceed together with the absence of an ekc for co2 emissions this evidence of ec in the absence of an ekc has two major implications firstly despite raising question on the sustainable nature of ongoing development process these results remain encouraging as a flatten ekc relationship is still noticeable in oecd countries secondly although they successfully contribute to decelerating pollutant emissions international agreements and economic mechanisms remain insufficiently strong and binding enough to substantially curb down co2 emissions per capita in high income countries hence larger efforts are still needed especially in hic to achieve a sustainable development process implication for environmental policy our main results suggesting an ongoing ec in the absence of ekc has some implications for environmental policy firstly they encourage hic to further work toward a transition from fossil energies to less polluting energies in order to achieve the sustainable development goals sdg a low carbon development the energy transition will cause substantial decreases in pollutant emissions and favour the emergence of an ekc this policy implication also applies to oecd countries although the relation co2 emissions income show a relatively flat behaviour a significant reduction in emissions is still very feasible in oecd countries as theoretically suggested by figure 1 secondly our results invite lic and middle income countries to promote investments in green and renewable energies supply as well as in energy efficient technologies contrary to the hic these actions may ensure in lic an economic transition to post industrial stages with low carbon levels and relatively low environmental impacts 9 concluding remarks this paper aims to merge empirical literature on environmental convergence and kuznets curve hypothesis arguing that the two perspectives are genuinely related it therefore proposes a unified empirical framework simultaneously testing ec and ekc relying on a semiparametric dynamic panel data model which also accounts for regressor endogeneity applying the so called unified empirical framework to a panel data sample of 106 countries observed between 1970 to 2015 delivers very insightful outcomes on the co2 emissions and income nexus globally our results mainly based on an instrumental variable estimator for semiparametric dynamic panel model do not support the existence of an inverted u shaped relationship between co2 emissions and gdp per capita on the opposite an increasing path is observed although the relation flattens for lower high income levels our results which are robust across both subsamples of oecd versus non oecd countries and lic versus hic provide clear evidence of convergence in co2 emissions this convergence can be reconciled with the absence of an ekc relationship as economies converge towards their steady states with high levels of co2 emissions consequently we can state that although their promising impacts on the reduction of emissions notably in rich countries international efforts and agreements aiming to reduce the global environmental impact of economic activities need to be intensified in order to invert the increasing relationship between economic growth and greenhouse co2 emissions such conclusions are relevant especially because they also hold for oecd countries indeed the overall relationship between co2 emissions and income remains increasing although it slightly flattens at high income levels despite existing international agreements the tertiarization of output structure technological advance economic incentives for environmentally friendly technologies of production from a policy point of view such evidence weakens the ability of rich economies and international institutions to effectively implement pro environmental policies in developing countries and raises serious concerns about the sustainability of the current development process the present study can be extended and replicated in various ways for instance by applying the analysis using different environmental indicators it may be of interest to further augment the main specification to investigate the role of determinants of co2 emissions and other environmental indicators in particular two kinds of factors could deserve special attention technological advance and policy measures this is left to future research credit authorship

respectively in both cases α the estimated coefficient for y i t 1 is less than 1 and significant implying convergence rates of 8 and 3 respectively regarding the relationship between emissions and
