24890,fish producers are facing high costs of food which rank between 30 60 out of total production costs optimal ration sizes are needed to improve management strategy by integrating technical economic efficiency and minimizing environmental impacts in contrast with the usual feeding practices in a farm and others consisting on normalized constant ratios on this work non constant optimal ration sizes throughout a culture cycle are determined to do this a bioeconomic model and the optimal control theory were employed the model was parameterized for the case of farmed tilapia culture in mexico and a potential type growth equation was selected optimal ration size trajectories were calculated for different destination markets monterrey mexico city cancun and on site and different harvest sizes 200 300 and 400 g the higher net profit was obtained in the monterrey market with 3 401 00usd tank for tilapia of 400 g whereas for sizes 300 and 200 g in cancun the higher net profits were 2 505 04usd tank and 1804 61usd tank respectively likewise produce small organisms to the markets of on site and cancun generate less tan and produce bigger fishes to the markets of mexico and monterrey increase tan generate we also present a discussion on the economic and ecological implications of optimal ration and decisions focused to the market management of tilapia keywords bioeconomic model optimization and simulation optimal control theory optimal ration size tilapia culture total ammonia nitrogen tan production 1 introduction aquaculture worldwide production reached 110 2 million metric tons on live weight of both animals and plants in 2016 representing 243 500 million dollars usd fao 2018 on year 2016 tilapia production reached 4 2 million metric tons fao 2018 tilapia culture contributes to improve livelihood on developing countries generates higher incomes food safety and fight against malnutrition due to its high protein content yue et al 2016 in recent years tilapia culture in mexico has increased constantly progressively and successfully thus representing nowadays more than 60 of the national production apún molina et al 2009 sosa villalobos et al 2016 this production is mainly commercialized by intermediaries or wholesalers hotels restaurants and industries of which 62 2 is gutted 24 3 alive and 13 5 as fillet arosamena villareal 2009 gonzález razo et al 2016 exportation of fresh and frozen fillet to usa has increased in the last years noaa fisheries noaa fisheries office of sciencie and technology 2018 even though tilapia exportation has been limited by the high national demand in mexico usa remains to be the country with the greatest potential for export norman lopez and asche 2008 olvera novoa et al 2005 in intensive aquaculture balanced feed represents 30 60 out of the total production costs mainly because protein content elevates the diet prize goddard 1996 hassan et al 2007 shipton and hasan 2013 daudpota et al 2014 for this reason the reduction in feeding cost per kg of fish harvested or produced could increase the success of aquaculture development li et al 2013 daudpota et al 2014 in practice feed schedules designed by feed producers are used to support a good performance of the production they indicate the feeding ratio according to the fish size body weight and water temperature however some producers base their support in observations of fish and consumed feed at the water surface not employing said feed schedules and offering instead fullness rations or above them to fish silverstein 2006 sun et al 2006 wang et al 2007 optimal management of ration size is essential for the management and analysis of a culture system since it directly influences the costs and efficiency of the production and economic benefit of the farm kumar and engle 2010 domínguez may et al 2011 passinato et al 2015 even the optimal ration size can aid to minimize the environmental impacts although this depends on the species system production methods location and quality of management little et al 2016 a farm that operates inefficiently will use more inputs than necessary to produce and will likewise increase the production of total ammonia nitrogen tan which also implies environmental damages poot lópez et al 2014 and negative effects on production high levels of tan which represent the sum of un ionized ammonia nh3 and ionized nh4 form causes gill hyperplasia low growth and fish survival benli et al 2008 besides that is a factor associated with parasitic and bacterial diseases paredes trujillo et al 2016 a better nutritional formulation pellet integrity and feed systems have been tested to mitigate waste and improve feed efﬁciencies frankic and hershner 2003 little et al 2016 in this context it is necessary to approach management strategies of feeding to reach a balance between the need for aquaculture development and the need for environmental conservation frankic and hershner 2003 policy of optimal management feed in farmed aquatic organisms has generated discussions in both theory and practice bioeconomic models have been used to better comprehend the impact of said policies that look after the benefit of the farm for a recent review see llorente and luna 2016 for example cacho et al 1991 determined cost effective feeding regimes in the fattening of channel catfish ictalurus punctatus accomplishing size of the ration percentage of protein in the diet and date of harvest similarly arnason 1992 determined the optimal feeding path for fish and optimal harvest time data which has been extended by several authors heaps 1993 analyzed the endogenous effect of different optimal feed rates in fish growth final sizes and optimal harvest time optimal feeding paths for the gilt head bream sparus aurata and shrimp penaeus indicus as well as the effect of size dependent prices as a linear and staggered function respectively to determine the optimum harvest time have been determined esmaeili 2005 mistiaen and strand 1999 león et al 2006 and hernández et al 2007 have evaluated the effect of water temperature on the change of the optimal ration size and the optimal harvest time of the gilt head bream sparus aurata culture up to date the dynamic optimal ration size according to different destination markets has not been studied in the scientific literature additionally dynamic optimal ration sizes for tilapia culture have not been analyzed either in species such as tilapia feeding is not yet completely well comprehended ng and romano 2013 that is why the search for strategies to improve the optimal management of feeding within a farm and to improve market strategies can represent great economic and sustainable advantages for the producers in yucatan intensive production is increasing since the 90 s there is a record of 126 farms mainly for nile tilapia culture which are classified as low technology and medium to high technology flores nava et al 2016 the low technology farms usually have 1 4 tanks with a maximum tank volume of 117 8 m3 and a fish density of 950 4500 by tank poot lópez et al 2010a b paredes trujillo et al 2016 the medium to high technology farms have around of 5 13 tanks with a maximum tank volume of 240 m3 and a fish density of 5 000 11 000 by tank poot lópez et al 2014 paredes trujillo et al 2016 however it grows with lack of regulation and supervision of environmental standards of farms through pouring their wastewater into the ground without any type of treatment this results in a growing source of pollution due to the karstic geology of the region that facilitates the rapid leaching of pollutants into the aquifers poot lópez et al 2014 the above together with the wastewater from pig and poultry farms and urban developments are the main anthropogenic factor of red tides on the coast enriquez et al 2010 flores nava et al 2016 therefore the aim of this study is to analyze the optimal feeding paths of tilapia considering the different market prices and sizes throughout a bioeconomic model that fitted with the tilapia culture features in yucatan mexico 2 material and methods 2 1 data for analysis data used for this study was obtained from the centro de investigación y estudios avanzados del instituto politécnico nacional cinvestav merida unit mexico data which were collected from an experimental fattening system for tilapia poot lópez et al 2014 four treatments were tested 100 80 50 by duplicates according to recommended ratios from feed schedules and a satiety ratio higher to 110 from the feed schedule treatments were normalized in the interval 0 1 as shown in table 1 experimental system consisted on eight fiberglass circular tanks under roof with a volume of 0 75 m3 useful capacity per tank through a semi closed recirculation system with solid trap and constant aeration system initial sowing density was of 44 0 m 3fish and biometrics were carried out each 14 days to adjust feeding ratios more details about experimental data can be found in poot lópez et al 2010a b domínguez may et al 2011 2 2 description of the bioeconomic model a bioeconomic model must include the biological relationships management decisions and economic results of production fig 1 shows the relevant variables in the tilapia model four submodels are included biological environmental management and economic respectively 2 2 1 the biological submodel several models have been used to represent the growth of cultured fish which have also been adapted from ecological models of population tian et al 1993 gamito 1998 hernandez llamas and ratkowsky 2004 these models have been modified to estimate the effects of diverse biological physiological and environmental variables additionally several mathematical formulations have been used to model instant rate of species growth in which the size of the feed ratio is the control variable arnason 1992 esmaeili 2005 hernández et al 2007 the modeling of tilapia growth has particularly received attention and the exponential logarithmic and asymptotic types are found among the most common models rosa et al 1997 dumas et al 2010 santos et al 2013 ansah and frimpong 2015 nevertheless growth models have mainly been of potential and logarithmic type on this study a model of potential type including ration size effect was employed which is represented by 1 d x d t g x r a r α e α 1 r x c x 0 x 0 where a and c are adjustment parameters x 0 is the individual s initial weight x t is the individual s size and r t is normalized ratio size both in t time the normalized ratio function r α e α 1 r including the anabolic growth rate eq 1 indicates that the feeding effect reaches an optimal level when r 1 value is reached for each α positive parameter α 0 statistical validation and simulation of the eq 1 is found in appendix a 2 2 2 the management submodel the biomass of the system during the culture is given by 2 b t x t n t where n t is the number of fishes at time t it is assumed that instant mortality rate throughout the culture cycle is constant and independent from the individual s size therefore the number of organisms in time n t is given by the following exponential model 3 n t 11000 e 0 00044 t feeding was calculated from the feed conversion ratio ξ fcr which indicates the feed quantity to increase a weight unit per individual 4 f x r ξ x r g x r where g is the growth rate the fcr is influenced by the weight of the organism and the individual daily ration which is represented by a logistic function 5 ξ x r 2 1 1 32 e 0 0175 x r 1 the total consumption of feed tf was obtained from the expression 6 t f t 0 t f x r n t d t 2 2 3 environmental submodel ammonium is the main final product of the metabolism of proteins in the cultures ionized nh4 and unionized nh3 respectively the sum of these two forms of ammonium is known as total ammonia nitrogen tan the equations proposed by timmons et al 2002 was used for estimates of the tan which is given by 7 t a n 0 0255 t f t for mayor details of the constant of production 0 0255 kg tan per kg feed see timmons et al 2002 and poot lópez et al 2014 this approximation may vary according to the percentage of protein in the diet poot lópez et al 2014 2 2 4 economic submodel 2 2 4 1 income it is common to find in the markets of aquaculture and fishery products a differentiation of price by sizes for which a continuously differentiable price function was assumed this function is given by 8 p x p max 1 e k x where p max is the maximum prize of fish per gram and k is a constant which quantifies the change of size price estimated parameters of the market price function can be found in table 2 the product s price is independent from size when k 0 for which p x p max the value of biomass through time is given by 9 v t p x x t n t where v t is the biomass value x t size and n t the number of organisms in time 2 2 4 2 cost models the model considers energy c e x r balanced feed c f x r and maintenance c m x r costs because of the simplicity of the optimization model the cost of labor was not included considering that the work of the majority of agro activities in the state of yucatan is primarily agricultural while aquaculture is a secondary activity and has the purpose of self consumption the variable costs f x r are 10 f x r c e x r c f x r c m x r the cost of electric energy consumed by the farm includes water motor pumps and aeration according to fish size gram day 24 h the different feeding schedules from the total ammonia nitrogen amount and the required water exchanges were calculated and calibrated for each ration size domínguez may et al 2011 poot lópez et al 2014 this function was defined by 11 c e x r x e r where e r represent the energy costs for water change and aeration per gram of tilapia per day 24 h the parameters of e r were adjustmented with real data and calibrated based on federal electricity commission fares cfe in spanish of mexico and data from león et al 2006 timmons et al 2002 and lekang 2007 e r is given by 12 e r 0 00056 r 2 0 00182 r 0 00044 feeding cost was calculated from eqs 4 and 5 given by 13 c f x r c f ξ x r g x r the maintenance cost c m x r m c x was assumed linearly dependent on size gasca leyva et al 2008 and the coefficient m c 0 00001 was calibrated according to the local market portraying the individual maintenance cost the total accumulated cost from the farm until t day is given by the expression 14 c t 0 t e i t f x r t n t d t c 0 where c 0 are fixed costs which include depreciation cost from infrastructure and the initial cost of juveniles t is the culture period and i the discount rate 2 3 optimal ration size although feeding of organisms in typical commercial aquaculture follows the recommendations of the food suppliers ration size is a decision made by the aquacultor and therefore it is under his her control assuming a single culture cycle the aquacultor s problem is to find the optimal daily ration path r t to optimize the present value of the benefits over time this can be formulated as 15 m a x π t t x t r t p x t x t e h t c 0 n 0 0 t e h t x t e r c f ξ x r g x r c m x d t 16 s t d x d t g x t r t x 0 x 0 17 0 r t 1 where t is the culture s time length x t is the harvest size p x t is the price at the harvest size and e h t is the discount factor h μ r is the sum of the discount and mortality rate n 0 is the individuals initial number and x t is the tilapia growth over time from sowing until it reaches commercial size at harvest time factors t and x t are optimally determined but they can be pre determined as well using the pontryagin s maximum principle to the problem eq 15 17 the dynamic equations of the ration size r t and instant growth x t are obtained leonard and van long 1992 grass et al 2008 from these equations the optimal solution of the problem is found numerically the technical details can be found in the appendix b 2 4 data parameters and assumptions for the bioeconomic analysis the parameters related to discount rates mortality market costs and market prices are described in table 2 which were considered for numerical quantifications for this study so that the effect of optimal ration size paths in a culture can be determined for numerical results 11 000 juveniles were taken into account as the initial number of individuals n 0 of 14 g prices per kg of fresh weight tilapia are shown in different potential markets of tilapia produced in yucatan including the sale at the farm current market the tourist area of cancun and other destinations of high demand of this species such as mexico city and monterrey unlike local trade the final value of the fish is differentiated in the national market according to the size which is an opportunity to obtain greater profitability to the production domínguez may et al 2011 since tilapia producers often face different demands of fish size optimal ration for market sizes of 200 300 and 400 g were determined marketing cost transportation and insurance cost of the product for the mexico monterrey and cancun market were 0 0871 0 1568 0 0412 usd kg 1 respectively domínguez may et al 2011 transportation and insurance costs are still valid in 2019 based on 20 tons according to the local national freight company grupo gal de s a de c v in spanish 3 results 3 1 optimal solution for sizes 200 300 and 400 g here we present the optimal solution for the ration size along the culture cycle assuming predetermined final sizes first fig 2 shows the ration size with respect to the fish weight along the culture cycle in each of the four market scenarios results indicate that optimal ration trajectories decrease as the fish size increases that is the decrease in the ration size observed in the growth of the fish is accelerated more when the fish are juveniles and then stabilizes when they reach the adult size second estimations on the quantity of consumed feed kg tank 1 according to commercial size can be seen in fig 3 optimal ration analysis demonstrates minimal differences of the consumed feed in the different scenarios fish of 400 g consumed more feed than inferior sizes as it was expected likewise the tilapia markets further away from the farm such as monterrey and mexico have a higher consumption feed table 3 shows the average levels of fcr under an optimal ration trajectory it also displays that as long as the size of the organism increases the fcr increases too on average the lesser fcr was seen in size 200 g at on site scenario while the higher fcr was observed in size 400 g at monterrey market scenario the potential market in monterrey scenario for size 400 g generated the higher net profits with 5381 21 usd tank 1 fig 4 and table 4 net profit results for fixed sizes 200 and 300 g under the market scenario of monterrey and cancun was the highest generating 3 447 48 usd and 2206 88 usd tank 1 respectively 3 2 optimal ration and harvest size now we present the solution assuming the harvest size is optimally selected by the producer table 5 the most profitable harvest time and size is 295 2 days and 439 0 g mexico 336 2 days and 482 8 g monterrey 254 6 days and 387 9 g cancun 199 5 days and 306 7 g on site price the market of monterrey with 6 938 78 usd per tank was the bioeconomic scenario which generated the maximum present value of the benefit in the tilapia culture the biomass and quantity of total consumed feed was 4 576 49 kg and 7 400 34 kg respectively table 5 on the other hand on site market with 2333 90 usd per tank was the bioeconomic scenario that generated the less present value out of the benefits just as previous bioeconomic analysis the optimal ration size decreases as the size of the organisms increase optimal ration ratings from the highest to the lowest were generated by the market price scenarios of on site cancun mexico and monterrey respectively table 5 3 3 tan the emissions of tan mg l 1 per day were estimated when tilapia were harvested at 200 300 and 400 g in one cycle table 6 in the trajectory of the optimal ration size based on the results of the dynamic optimization problem the amount of the lowest tan was produced by on site markets with 200 400 g varying from 1 60 to 1 61 mg l 1 per day while the amount of highest tan was estimated on monterrey with 2 16 2 79 mg l 1 per day the emissions of tan on the optimal ration size were 2 42 2 33 1 57 and 1 57 mg l 1 per day for an optimal fish size 482 8 439 0 306 7 and 387 9 g for the markets of mexico monterrey on site and cancun respectively 4 discussion 4 1 dynamic ration optimal feed is one of the responsible factors for a quick growth rate abbas et al 2015 in aquaculture the determination of the adequate rations for commercial fish such as tilapia are important to achieve maximum productivity ahmed 2007 on this study the optimal ration trajectory over satiety for tilapia is shown to decrease as fish grow similar results have been observed by hernández et al 2007 for the gilt head bream sparus aurata these authors found long term growing and decreasing trends of optimal ration levels based on water temperature additionally the food decrease found on this work could also be justified on the basis of the physiology of the organisms brett 1979 which reduce their feeding rate once they reach sexual maturity xie et al 1997 results obtained on this study are also in agreement with the tendencies of the feeding schedules provided by the feed producers as fish grow the ration rate decreases aside from the recommendations of the feeding schedules constant ration sizes are usually employed in fish culture by example riche et al 2004 allowing a feeding based on satiety where during a period of four hours juveniles of 12 g showed a significant higher growth when was an increase of 30 60 bw from an economic perspective a profitable feeding strategy for tilapia with an average weight of 61 9 g was shown by el saidy and gaber 2005 carried out under a feeding rate of 2 bw value slightly higher than 1 8 bw 0 42 as observed in table 1 a similar study was shown by domínguez may et al 2011 discovering that the ration size of 0 67 generated the higher economic returns in farms of tilapia in the yucatan state méxico this work contributes by finding an optimal dynamic ration size in accordance to the size of fish the determination of the adequate ratios for aquaculture commercial species such as tilapia is important so that a maximum productivity is reached ahmed 2007 lugert et al 2016 this paper finds that using constant ration sizes is a suboptimal feeding practice moreover ration sizes above the optimum range implies a greater consumption of food which can also have a negative impact on the growth of fish by reducing the levels of dissolved oxygen in the culture tank león et al 2001 the pm is commonly used in aquaculture to shape the instant growth rate of fish hopkins 1992 and its use has been adapted to bioeconomic analysis of the gilt head bream gasca leyva et al 2002 hernández et al 2003 león et al 2006 and shrimp sánchez zazueta et al 2013 these authors have used a growth model that includes effect of the size level ratio and effect of water temperature other works related to the optimal feeding problem are found in arnason 1992 cacho et al 1991 mistiaen and strand 1999 however said studies have used natural logarithmic type models depending on time 4 2 feed conversion ratio fcr the fcr indicates the harnessing of the amount of balanced feed that is supplied to the organisms of a tank under adequate conditions for its development our fcr range was of 1 3 1 46 1 48 1 32 1 20 1 48 and 1 31 1 46 for the markets of mexico monterrey on site and cancun respectively these fcr values are found within the reported range of tilapia by other authors for instance ruiz velazco et al 2006 found for juvenile tilapia an fcr of 1 21 although other authors have reported values of 1 27 and 1 68 with sowing densities of 125 and 200 juveniles m 3 ridha 2006 1 45 2 61 suresh and lin 1992 1 01 1 6 diana et al 2004 1 45 2 40 for red tilapia yi et al 1996 the relation of ration and fcr described for some species such as turbot red drum rainbow trout carp and tilapia have high values of fcr van ham et al 2003 bureau et al 2006 wang et al 2007 poot lópez et al 2014 al ahmad et al 1988 evaluated three ratio sizes for oreochromis spilurus tilapia fattening for sizes of 70 and 250 g they found the lower fcr within normalized ratios of 0 33 and 0 75 respectively xie et al 1997 analyzed different ratio sizes in a recirculating system for tilapia culture where they found that the lower fcr value was associated with ratio on range 0 40 0 50 regarding maximum ratio however this estimation was carried out for fish of an average weight of 50 g fcr values of 1 66 1 23 and 1 80 have been reported for semi intensive intensive and super intensive conditions respectively toledo pérez and garcía capote 2000 poot lópez et al 2010a b found fcrs of 1 82 1 69 and 1 28 for feeding levels of satiation 100 and 50 of body weight respectively higher net economic benefits for tilapia culture have demonstrated to be achieved by ratio sizes below satiety domínguez may et al 2011 poot lópez et al 2014 the results of this work demonstrate that operating in conditions of optimal feeding would help producers to maintain low levels of fcr and this on economic terms means it is cost saving 4 3 markets the market influences over the optimal combination of input employed in the production since variations on prices can directly influence over the optimal harvest time bjørndal et al 2004 however the problem extends when the effect of the optimal feed is considered over the optimal harvest time arnason 1992 esmaeili 2005 domínguez may et al 2011 through evaluating different market prices of tilapia this study revealed that if a market with fixed low prices is considered better optimal ration trajectories with low levels of fcr are generated with regard to those depending on size this result is in agreement to that of domínguez may et al 2011 who found that the market strategy of tilapia influences over the farm s optimal production management and also affect optimum feed regime hence changes on the selling price of fish and costs of feeding or juveniles will affect the feeding and juvenile rate and consequently the production and benefit hebicha et al 2013 poot lópez et al 2014 the supply of low ration sizes in the face of a fixed low price scenario can provide savings in feed costs in addition to reducing discharges from nitrogenous wastes to the environment domínguez may et al 2011 poot lópez et al 2014 on the other hand market differentiation of ration and well remunerated market prices can lead to new opportunities for farmers such as distribution of products and better profits tilapia culture is a vulnerable activity among national and worldwide industries due to high input costs and low market prices olvera novoa et al 2005 in the state of yucatan mexico commercialization of tilapia is done by local trade intermediaries who buy the product from farmers at a price and or specific size therefore obtaining higher profits than producers domínguez may et al 2011 gonzález razo et al 2016 this situation is similar to that described by hishamunda and subasinghe 2003 who observed that in some of the rural areas of china the profit margin in each link of the commercial chain is from 10 to 20 where the producer is the link that obtains less profit more recently gonzález razo et al 2016 recorded a similar situation with tilapia in a case study performed in the state of mexico mexico producers capacity to negotiate more competitive prices is limited because of the lack of knowledge organization infrastructure and adequate sanitation for the product s marketing and production brummet et al 2008 this paper provides the best feeding practices for producers in this situation and compares the profitability obtained if farmers would access directly to other markets specifically the net profit increased more than 400 when the producers located in yucatan sell the product in the market of monterrey table 6 results of the optimal ration trajectories such as fixed prices independent to size of the markets of cancun and on site registered optimal ratios under markets of mexico and monterrey under variable prices the obtained results regarding the marginal growth of tilapia are positive and increasing thus achieving larger sizes exponential growth a smaller requirement of the size of the feed ration is reflected when fish increase in size brett 1979 xie et al 1997 4 4 production of sizes 200 300 and 400 g optimization of the feeding strategy not only maximizes the fish growth the feed conversion factor but can minimize the heterogeneity of sizes pollution as well as production costs schnaittacher et al 2005 domínguez may et al 2011 optimal ration stands out as a problem that has been studied in several different species ahmed 2007 khan and abidi 2010 there are however relative few studies which consider the bioeconomic and dynamic analysis relying on the size of the organisms cacho et al 1990 león et al 2006 hernández et al 2007 to our knowledge there is no study for this in tilapia bioeconomic results of this study suggest that for the production of individuals of 400 g directed to markets where prices go according to sizes the monterrey scenario offers good results meanwhile sizes of 200 and 300 g generate better benefits for the cancun market with fixed prices these same sizes were analyzed by poot lópez et al 2014 for tilapia through a study that determined the optimal combination of balanced feed and chaya or tree spinach leaves for tilapia s nutrition from a bioeconomic perspective these authors discovered that higher benefits are seen in 300 g sizes while 400 g sizes generated higher pollution of total ammonia nitrogen tan if the price is fixed it is more convenient to produce fish of 200 g sizes with market sizes 200 and 300 g be got less profitability than with 400 g but it is more sustainable ie be produce less tan by example on the site and cancun are less profitable for the producer but more sustainable for the environment manipulation of size can be employed to reach maximum production under scenarios where water temperature cannot be controlled such as in this study ahmed 2007 different fixed ration size and their influence over the optimal harvest time and environment have been studied with the purpose of discovering market strategies domínguez may et al 2011 poot lópez et al 2014 these authors have recommended the use of size ratios below of those suggested by feeding schedules which are provided by feed factories mainly for tilapia fattening the results of this work are in agreement with the conclusions of these authors likewise for the success of any commercial farm is important to adapt the knowledge to the levels of optimal ratios khan and abidi 2010 rations trajectories and optimal harvest time are influenced by prices market sizes and even the type of growth model the bieconomic analysis for management decisions will depend on the generated data of the culture species culture system management and feeding conditions site of culture among other factors 4 5 tan the dynamic optimal ration size has been widely studied in aquaculture several studies have addressed it from an economic approach arnason 1992 cacho et al 1990 esmaeili 2005 león et al 2006 hernández et al 2007 however the generated tan has not been estimated in the optimal trajectory of feeding many factors may affect tan production such as temperature salinity alkalinity fish species dissolved oxygen etc brunty et al 1997 bureau et al 2006 in this study water quality parameters were recorded in acceptable ranges for tilapia culture and they were considered as optimal poot lópez et al 2014 have shown that the optimal ration can significantly reduce the tan supply in fish farms which is confirmed in this work by assuming a dynamic optimal ration size of feeding however tan emissions mg l 1 per day in the optimal trajectory of feeding for tilapia of 200 300 and 400 g see table 6 were slightly minor to those presented by poot lópez et al 2014 these authors showed their estimations of tan in the optimal ration size considering fixed and variable prices whose standardized values for 200 300 and 400 g for tilapia were 2 29 2 94 and 3 42 and 2 16 2 94 and 3 41 mg l 1 respectively this suggests that a non constant optimal ration size throughout a culture cycle is more friendly towards the environment likewise it is clear there is a dichotomy between obtaining greater benefit and reducing contamination for example the producer can choose to produce small organisms through reducing cost and contamination in order to generate less tan in on site or cancun markets on the contrary he can choose to produce bigger fish to obtain greater benefits through sending the product to the markets of mexico or monterrey ammonia is an environmental toxicant that is especially problematic for aquatic organisms benli et al 2008 the results can help the yucatan producers to address the environmental problem thereby decreasing the ecological hardship implied by the production of tilapia however for a better comprehension of decision results where there are criteria or targets conflicting is proposed the study of trade offs using multi criteria optimization martínez cordero and leung 2004 vergara solana et al 2019 although in this study was not addressed the multiple criteria decision has been applied in recent works of cultivation of sea bream luna et al 2019a b the hydrographic basin of the yucatan shows some particular features such as a karstic type of soil which favors rainwater infiltration to the aquifer and important web of groundwater discharge in the coastal zone through springs and non point sources herrera silveira et al 2004 urban development and other productive activities that generate discharges to groundwater or the sea can produce eutrophication processes this generates a transfer of organic matter towards the bottom of the sea developing anoxic situations and can generate the flowering of toxic algae and the alteration in the structure of communities in coastal ecosystems goldberg 1995 according to results in this study total ammonia nitrogen tan accumulated per day was generally higher than 1 mg l in comparison to recommended values for tilapia culture timmons and ebeling 2010 however celik 2012 found tan values ranging from 0 9 to 1 9 mg l 1 and recommended such system as still applicable to commercial tilapia production similarly other studies have found high tan values celik 2012 rakocy et al 2004 poot lópez et al 2014 rakocy et al 2004 obtained a tan average of 1 15 and 1 85 mg l in two trials where the tan concentration reached peaks of 8 55 mg l for a short period however there was no observed mortality during this period and the feeding ration did not decline rakocy et al 2004 also it should be noted that the tan in this study was estimated from the amount of food supplied in the system it has been calculated that balanced food contributes up to 88 93 of the endogenous nitrogen generated in the system for this reason tan values show to be high in culture ponds fernandes et al 2007 ingle de la mora et al 2003 montanhini neto and ostrensky 2015 accordingly the daily water exchange and the high levels of dissolved oxygen saturation may contribute to keeping tan values low ingle de la mora et al 2003 likewise under optimal ration size it could reduce the amount of nitrogen discharged into the environment montanhini neto and ostrensky 2015 by considering optimal management strategies on aquaculture farms such as food this can promote more sustainable activity in the ecological field which can reduce production costs this means improving the competitive capacity of the farm in the production of sustainable food of high quality and reducing the risks of environmental pollution and at the same time improving the economic benefits bosma and verdegem 2011 ornelas luna et al 2017 what could offer consumers products that had in the process of production an environmental balance care feucht and zander 2015 5 conclusion this work contributes to the management on optimal feed for tilapia culture in particular the paper finds that a dynamic optimal ration size along a culture cycle this ration decreases with fish size and depends on the final harvest size and market strategy the analysis indicates that fixed prices require lesser optimal ration sizes and generate less tan whereas in variable prices upper optimal ration sizes are required and generate up tan according to our results it is recommended to focus the market strategy to distant markets variable prices and bigger sizes 400 g if a producer decides to maximize his benefits on the contrary if the producer decides to reduce contamination it is recommended to produce small sized fish 200 g and trade the fish product on the on site market the analysis for optimal ration trajectories used the optimal control theory to generate bioeconomic results data which can be useful for producers to obtain better profits by making management and food supply more efficient and thus minimizing feeding costs even though the model is simple it can be used on the industry to generate optimal ration sizes and obtain a dynamic growth however the analysis shows other limitations for example lack controlled variables such as initial culture density or other extrinsic variables as water temperature which is a stress factor that directly affects fish nutrition likewise culture cycles and optimal rotation time as well as elements of uncertainty have not been considered in this analysis these factors can be analyzed in further research projects focused on improving the economy of aquaculture on the other hand this work is focused on production systems major controlled as tank cultures and considers single batch production however for multi batch culture it is recommended to apply the same principles by each batch likewise for a better comprehension of analysis of the trade off between economic performance and environmental multiple criteria decision making optimization methodologies can be applied for a better decisions discern finally this work shows producers that it is important to know the different destination markets to direct the system to the best productive performance both biological and economic in addition by considering the optimal ration size it could reduce food costs increase economic benefits as well as reduce environmental impact however future research s directed in this line can generate more knowledge considering this topic declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

24890,fish producers are facing high costs of food which rank between 30 60 out of total production costs optimal ration sizes are needed to improve management strategy by integrating technical economic efficiency and minimizing environmental impacts in contrast with the usual feeding practices in a farm and others consisting on normalized constant ratios on this work non constant optimal ration sizes throughout a culture cycle are determined to do this a bioeconomic model and the optimal control theory were employed the model was parameterized for the case of farmed tilapia culture in mexico and a potential type growth equation was selected optimal ration size trajectories were calculated for different destination markets monterrey mexico city cancun and on site and different harvest sizes 200 300 and 400 g the higher net profit was obtained in the monterrey market with 3 401 00usd tank for tilapia of 400 g whereas for sizes 300 and 200 g in cancun the higher net profits were 2 505 04usd tank and 1804 61usd tank respectively likewise produce small organisms to the markets of on site and cancun generate less tan and produce bigger fishes to the markets of mexico and monterrey increase tan generate we also present a discussion on the economic and ecological implications of optimal ration and decisions focused to the market management of tilapia keywords bioeconomic model optimization and simulation optimal control theory optimal ration size tilapia culture total ammonia nitrogen tan production 1 introduction aquaculture worldwide production reached

tilapia culture contributes to improve livelihood on developing countries generates higher incomes food safety and fight against malnutrition due to its high protein content yue et al 2016 in recent years tilapia culture in mexico has increased constantly progressively and successfully thus representing nowadays more than 60 of the national production apún molina et al 2009 sosa villalobos et al 2016 this production is mainly commercialized by intermediaries or wholesalers hotels restaurants and industries of which 62 2 is gutted 24 3 alive and 13 5 as fillet arosamena villareal 2009 gonzález razo et al 2016 exportation of fresh and frozen fillet to usa has increased in the last years noaa fisheries noaa fisheries office of sciencie and technology 2018 even though tilapia exportation has been limited by the high national demand in mexico usa remains to be the country with the greatest potential for export norman lopez and asche 2008 olvera novoa et al 2005 in intensive aquaculture balanced feed represents 30 60 out of the total production costs mainly because protein content elevates the diet prize goddard 1996 hassan et al 2007 shipton and hasan 2013 daudpota et al 2014 for this reason the reduction in feeding cost per kg of fish harvested or produced could increase the success of aquaculture development li et al 2013 daudpota et al 2014 in practice feed schedules designed by feed producers are used to support a good performance of the production they indicate the feeding ratio according to the fish size body weight and water temperature however some producers base their support in observations of fish and consumed feed at the water surface not employing said feed schedules and offering instead fullness rations or above them to fish silverstein 2006 sun et al 2006 wang et al 2007 optimal management of ration size is essential for the management and analysis of a culture system since it directly influences the costs and efficiency of the production and economic benefit of the farm kumar and engle 2010 domínguez may et al 2011 passinato et al 2015 even the optimal ration size can aid to minimize the environmental impacts although this depends on the species system production methods location and quality of management little et al 2016 a farm that operates inefficiently will use more inputs than necessary to produce and will likewise increase the production of total ammonia nitrogen tan which also implies environmental damages poot lópez et al 2014 and negative effects on production high levels of tan which represent the sum of un ionized ammonia nh3 and ionized nh4 form causes gill hyperplasia low growth and fish survival benli et al 2008 besides that is a factor associated with parasitic and bacterial diseases paredes trujillo et al 2016 a better nutritional formulation pellet integrity and feed systems have been tested to mitigate waste and improve feed efﬁciencies frankic and hershner 2003 little et al 2016 in this context it is necessary to approach management strategies of feeding to reach a balance between the need for aquaculture development and the need for environmental conservation frankic and hershner 2003 policy of optimal management feed in farmed aquatic organisms has generated discussions in both theory and practice bioeconomic models have been used to better comprehend the impact of said policies that look after the benefit of the farm for a recent review see llorente and luna 2016 for example cacho et al 1991 determined cost effective feeding regimes in the fattening of channel catfish ictalurus punctatus accomplishing size of the ration percentage of protein in the diet and date of harvest similarly arnason 1992 determined the optimal feeding path for fish and optimal harvest time data which has been extended by several authors heaps 1993 analyzed the endogenous effect of different optimal feed rates in fish growth final sizes and optimal harvest time optimal feeding paths for the gilt head bream sparus aurata and shrimp penaeus indicus as well as the effect of size dependent prices as a linear and staggered function respectively to determine the optimum harvest time have been determined esmaeili 2005 mistiaen and strand 1999 león et al 2006 and hernández et al 2007 have evaluated the effect of water temperature on the change of the optimal ration size and the optimal harvest time of the gilt head bream sparus aurata culture up to date the dynamic optimal ration size according to different destination markets has not been studied in the scientific literature additionally dynamic optimal ration sizes for tilapia culture have not been analyzed either in species such as tilapia feeding is not yet completely well comprehended ng and romano 2013 that is why the search for strategies to improve the optimal management of feeding within a farm and to improve market strategies can represent great economic and sustainable advantages for the producers in yucatan intensive production is increasing since the 90 s there is a record of 126 farms mainly for nile tilapia culture which are classified as low technology and medium to high technology flores nava et al 2016 the low technology farms usually have 1 4 tanks with a maximum tank volume of 117 8 m3 and a fish density of 950 4500 by tank poot lópez et al 2010a b paredes trujillo et al 2016 the medium to high technology farms have around of 5 13 tanks with a maximum tank volume of 240 m3 and a fish density of 5 000 11 000 by tank poot lópez et al 2014 paredes trujillo et al 2016 however it grows with lack of regulation and supervision of environmental standards of farms through pouring their wastewater into the ground without any type of treatment this results in a growing source of pollution due to the karstic geology of the region that facilitates the rapid leaching of pollutants into the aquifers poot lópez et al 2014 the above together with the wastewater from pig and poultry farms and urban developments are the main anthropogenic factor of red tides on the coast enriquez et al 2010 flores nava et al 2016 therefore the aim of this study is to analyze the optimal feeding paths of tilapia considering the different market prices and sizes throughout a bioeconomic model that fitted with the tilapia culture features in yucatan mexico 2 material and methods 2 1 data for analysis data used for this study was obtained from the centro de investigación y estudios avanzados del instituto politécnico nacional cinvestav merida unit mexico data which were collected from an experimental fattening system for tilapia poot lópez et al 2014 four treatments were tested 100 80 50 by duplicates according to recommended ratios from feed schedules and a satiety ratio higher to 110 from the feed schedule treatments were normalized in the interval 0 1 as shown in table 1 experimental system consisted on eight fiberglass circular tanks under roof with a volume of 0 75 m3 useful capacity per tank through a semi closed recirculation system with solid trap and constant aeration system initial sowing density was of 44 0 m 3fish and biometrics were carried out each 14 days to adjust feeding ratios more details about experimental data can be found in poot lópez et al 2010a b domínguez may et al 2011 2 2 description of the bioeconomic model a bioeconomic model must include the biological relationships management decisions and economic results of production fig 1 shows the relevant variables in the tilapia model four submodels are included biological environmental management and economic respectively 2 2 1 the biological submodel several models have been used to represent the growth of cultured fish which have also been adapted from ecological models of population tian et al 1993 gamito 1998 hernandez llamas and ratkowsky 2004 these models have been modified to estimate the effects of diverse biological physiological and environmental variables additionally several mathematical formulations have been used to model instant rate of species growth in which the size of the feed ratio is the control variable arnason 1992 esmaeili 2005 hernández et al 2007 the modeling of tilapia growth has particularly received attention and the exponential logarithmic and asymptotic types are found among the most common models rosa et al 1997 dumas et al 2010 santos et al 2013 ansah and frimpong 2015 nevertheless growth models have mainly been of potential and logarithmic type on this study a model of potential type including ration size effect was employed which is represented by 1 d x d t g x r a r α e α 1 r x c x 0 x 0 where a and c are adjustment parameters x 0 is the individual s initial weight x t is the individual s size and r t is normalized ratio size both in t time the normalized ratio function r α e α 1 r including the anabolic growth rate eq 1 indicates that the feeding effect reaches an optimal level when r 1 value is reached for each α positive parameter α 0 statistical validation and simulation of the eq 1 is found in appendix a 2 2 2 the management submodel the biomass of the system during the culture is given by 2 b t x t n t where n t is the number of fishes at time t it is assumed that instant mortality rate throughout the culture cycle is constant and independent from the individual s size therefore the number of organisms in time n t is given by the following exponential model 3 n t 11000 e 0 00044 t feeding was calculated from the feed conversion ratio ξ fcr which indicates the feed quantity to increase a weight unit per individual 4 f x r ξ x r g x r where g is the growth rate the fcr is influenced by the weight of the organism and the individual daily ration which is represented by a logistic function 5 ξ x r 2 1 1 32 e 0 0175 x r 1 the total consumption of feed tf was obtained from the expression 6 t f t 0 t f x r n t d t 2 2 3 environmental submodel ammonium is the main final product of the metabolism of proteins in the cultures ionized nh4 and unionized nh3 respectively the sum of these two forms of ammonium is known as total ammonia nitrogen tan the equations proposed by timmons et al 2002 was used for estimates of the tan which is given by 7 t a n 0 0255 t f t for mayor details of the constant of production 0 0255 kg tan per kg feed see timmons et al 2002 and poot lópez et al 2014 this approximation may vary according to the percentage of protein in the diet poot lópez et al 2014 2 2 4 economic submodel 2 2 4 1 income it is common to find in the markets of aquaculture and fishery products a differentiation of price by sizes for which a continuously differentiable price function was assumed this function is given by 8 p x p max 1 e k x where p max is the maximum prize of fish per gram and k is a constant which quantifies the change of size price estimated parameters of the market price function can be found in table 2 the product s price is independent from size when k 0 for which p x p max the value of biomass through time is given by 9 v t p x x t n t where v t is the biomass value x t size and n t the number of organisms in time 2 2 4 2 cost models the model considers energy c e x r balanced feed c f x r and maintenance c m x r costs because of the simplicity of the optimization model the cost of labor was not included considering that the work of the majority of agro activities in the state of yucatan is primarily agricultural while aquaculture is a secondary activity and has the purpose of self consumption the variable costs f x r are 10 f x r c e x r c f x r c m x r the cost of electric energy consumed by the farm includes water motor pumps and aeration according to fish size gram day 24 h the different feeding schedules from the total ammonia nitrogen amount and the required water exchanges were calculated and calibrated for each ration size domínguez may et al 2011 poot lópez et al 2014 this function was defined by 11 c e x r x e r where e r represent the energy costs for water change and aeration per gram of tilapia per day 24 h the parameters of e r were adjustmented with real data and calibrated based on federal electricity commission fares cfe in spanish of mexico and data from león et al 2006 timmons et al 2002 and lekang 2007 e r is given by 12 e r 0 00056 r 2 0 00182 r 0 00044 feeding cost was calculated from eqs 4 and 5 given by 13 c f x r c f ξ x r g x r the maintenance cost c m x r m c x was assumed linearly dependent on size gasca leyva et al 2008 and the coefficient m c 0 00001 was calibrated according to the local market portraying the individual maintenance cost the total accumulated cost from the farm until t day is given by the expression 14 c t 0 t e i t f x r t n t d t c 0 where c 0 are fixed costs which include depreciation cost from infrastructure and the initial cost of juveniles t is the culture period and i the discount rate 2 3 optimal ration size although feeding of organisms in typical commercial aquaculture follows the recommendations of the food suppliers ration size is a decision made by the aquacultor and therefore it is under his her control assuming a single culture cycle the aquacultor s problem is to find the optimal daily ration path r t to optimize the present value of the benefits over time this can be formulated as 15 m a x π t t x t r t p x t x t e h t c 0 n 0 0 t e h t x t e r c f ξ x r g x r c m x d t 16 s t d x d t g x t r t x 0 x 0 17 0 r t 1 where t is the culture s time length x t is the harvest size p x t is the price at the harvest size and e h t is the discount factor h μ r is the sum of the discount and mortality rate n 0 is the individuals initial number and x t is the tilapia growth over time from sowing until it reaches commercial size at harvest time factors t and x t are optimally determined but they can be pre determined as well using the pontryagin s maximum principle to the problem eq 15 17 the dynamic equations of the ration size r t and instant growth x t are obtained leonard and van long 1992 grass et al 2008 from these equations the optimal solution of the problem is found numerically the technical details can be found in the appendix b 2 4 data parameters and assumptions for the bioeconomic analysis the parameters related to discount rates mortality market costs and market prices are described in table 2 which were considered for numerical quantifications for this study so that the effect of optimal ration size paths in a culture can be determined for numerical results 11 000 juveniles were taken into account as the initial number of individuals n 0 of 14 g prices per kg of fresh weight tilapia are shown in different potential markets of tilapia produced in yucatan including the sale at the farm current market the tourist area of cancun and other destinations of high demand of this species such as mexico city and monterrey unlike local trade the final value of the fish is differentiated in the national market according to the size which is an opportunity to obtain greater profitability to the production domínguez may et al 2011 since tilapia producers often face different demands of fish size optimal ration for market sizes of 200 300 and 400 g were determined marketing cost transportation and insurance cost of the product for the mexico monterrey and cancun market were 0 0871 0 1568 0 0412 usd kg 1 respectively domínguez may et al 2011 transportation and insurance costs are still valid in 2019 based on 20 tons according to the local national freight company grupo gal de s a de c v in spanish 3 results 3 1 optimal solution for sizes 200 300 and 400 g here we present the optimal solution for the ration size along the culture cycle assuming predetermined final sizes first fig 2 shows the ration size with respect to the fish weight along the culture cycle in each of the four market scenarios results indicate that optimal ration trajectories decrease as the fish size increases that is the decrease in the ration size observed in the growth of the fish is accelerated more when the fish are juveniles and then stabilizes when they reach the adult size second estimations on the quantity of consumed feed kg tank 1 according to commercial size can be seen in fig 3 optimal ration analysis demonstrates minimal differences of the consumed feed in the different scenarios fish of 400 g consumed more feed than inferior sizes as it was expected likewise the tilapia markets further away from the farm such as monterrey and mexico have a higher consumption feed table 3 shows the average levels of fcr under an optimal ration trajectory it also displays that as long as the size of the organism increases the fcr increases too on average the lesser fcr was seen in size 200 g at on site scenario while the higher fcr was observed in size 400 g at monterrey market scenario the potential market in monterrey scenario for size 400 g generated the higher net profits with 5381 21 usd tank 1 fig 4 and table 4 net profit results for fixed sizes 200 and 300 g under the market scenario of monterrey and cancun was the highest generating 3 447 48 usd and 2206 88 usd tank 1 respectively 3 2 optimal ration and harvest size now we present the solution assuming the harvest size is optimally selected by the producer table 5 the most profitable harvest time and size is 295 2 days and 439 0 g mexico 336 2 days and 482 8 g monterrey 254 6 days and 387 9 g cancun 199 5 days and 306 7 g on site price the market of monterrey with 6 938 78 usd per tank was the bioeconomic scenario which generated the maximum present value of the benefit in the tilapia culture the biomass and quantity of total consumed feed was 4 576 49 kg and 7 400 34 kg respectively table 5 on the other hand on site market with 2333 90 usd per tank was the bioeconomic scenario that generated the less present value out of the benefits just as previous bioeconomic analysis the optimal ration size decreases as the size of the organisms increase optimal ration ratings from the highest to the lowest were generated by the market price scenarios of on site cancun mexico and monterrey respectively table 5 3 3 tan the emissions of tan mg l 1 per day were estimated when tilapia were harvested at 200 300 and 400 g in one cycle table 6 in the trajectory of the optimal ration size based on the results of the dynamic optimization problem the amount of the lowest tan was produced by on site markets with 200 400 g varying from 1 60 to 1 61 mg l 1 per day while the amount of highest tan was estimated on monterrey with 2 16 2 79 mg l 1 per day the emissions of tan on the optimal ration size were 2 42 2 33 1 57 and 1 57 mg l 1 per day for an optimal fish size 482 8 439 0 306 7 and 387 9 g for the markets of mexico monterrey on site and cancun respectively 4 discussion 4 1 dynamic ration optimal feed is one of the responsible factors for a quick growth rate abbas et al 2015 in aquaculture the determination of the adequate rations for commercial fish such as tilapia are important to achieve maximum productivity ahmed 2007 on this study the optimal ration trajectory over satiety for tilapia is shown to decrease as fish grow similar results have been observed by hernández et al 2007 for the gilt head bream sparus aurata these authors found long term growing and decreasing trends of optimal ration levels based on water temperature additionally the food decrease found on this work could also be justified on the basis of the physiology of the organisms brett 1979 which reduce their feeding rate once they reach sexual maturity xie et al 1997 results obtained on this study are also in agreement with the tendencies of the feeding schedules provided by the feed producers as fish grow the ration rate decreases aside from the recommendations of the feeding schedules constant ration sizes are usually employed in fish culture by example riche et al 2004 allowing a feeding based on satiety where during a period of four hours juveniles of 12 g showed a significant higher growth when was an increase of 30 60 bw from an economic perspective a profitable feeding strategy for tilapia with an average weight of 61 9 g was shown by el saidy and gaber 2005 carried out under a feeding rate of 2 bw value slightly higher than 1 8 bw 0 42 as observed in table 1 a similar study was shown by domínguez may et al 2011 discovering that the ration size of 0 67 generated the higher economic returns in farms of tilapia in the yucatan state méxico this work contributes by finding an optimal dynamic ration size in accordance to the size of fish the determination of the adequate ratios for aquaculture commercial species such as tilapia is important so that a maximum productivity is reached ahmed 2007 lugert et al 2016 this paper finds that using constant ration sizes is a suboptimal feeding practice moreover ration sizes above the optimum range implies a greater consumption of food which can also have a negative impact on the growth of fish by reducing the levels of dissolved oxygen in the culture tank león et al 2001 the pm is commonly used in aquaculture to shape the instant growth rate of fish hopkins 1992 and its use has been adapted to bioeconomic analysis of the gilt head bream gasca leyva et al 2002 hernández et al 2003 león et al 2006 and shrimp sánchez zazueta et al 2013 these authors have used a growth model that includes effect of the size level ratio and effect of water temperature other works related to the optimal feeding problem are found in arnason 1992 cacho et al 1991 mistiaen and strand 1999 however said studies have used natural logarithmic type models depending on time 4 2 feed conversion ratio fcr the fcr indicates the harnessing of the amount of balanced feed that is supplied to the organisms of a tank under adequate conditions for its development our fcr range was of 1 3 1 46 1 48 1 32 1 20 1 48 and 1 31 1 46 for the markets of mexico monterrey on site and cancun respectively these fcr values are found within the reported range of tilapia by other authors for instance ruiz velazco et al 2006 found for juvenile tilapia an fcr of 1 21 although other authors have reported values of 1 27 and 1 68 with sowing densities of 125 and 200 juveniles m 3 ridha 2006 1 45 2 61 suresh and lin 1992 1 01 1 6 diana et al 2004 1 45 2 40 for red tilapia yi et al 1996 the relation of ration and fcr described for some species such as turbot red drum rainbow trout carp and tilapia have high values of fcr van ham et al 2003 bureau et al 2006 wang et al 2007 poot lópez et al 2014 al ahmad et al 1988 evaluated three ratio sizes for oreochromis spilurus tilapia fattening for sizes of 70 and 250 g they found the lower fcr within normalized ratios of 0 33 and 0 75 respectively xie et al 1997 analyzed different ratio sizes in a recirculating system for tilapia culture where they found that the lower fcr value was associated with ratio on range 0 40 0 50 regarding maximum ratio however this estimation was carried out for fish of an average weight of 50 g fcr values of 1 66 1 23 and 1 80 have been reported for semi intensive intensive and super intensive conditions respectively toledo pérez and garcía capote 2000 poot lópez et al 2010a b found fcrs of 1 82 1 69 and 1 28 for feeding levels of satiation 100 and 50 of body weight respectively higher net economic benefits for tilapia culture have demonstrated to be achieved by ratio sizes below satiety domínguez may et al 2011 poot lópez et al 2014 the results of this work demonstrate that operating in conditions of optimal feeding would help producers to maintain low levels of fcr and this on economic terms means it is cost saving 4 3 markets the market influences over the optimal combination of input employed in the production since variations on prices can directly influence over the optimal harvest time bjørndal et al 2004 however the problem extends when the effect of the optimal feed is considered over the optimal harvest time arnason 1992 esmaeili 2005 domínguez may et al 2011 through evaluating different market prices of tilapia this study revealed that if a market with fixed low prices is considered better optimal ration trajectories with low levels of fcr are generated with regard to those depending on size this result is in agreement to that of domínguez may et al 2011 who found that the market strategy of tilapia influences over the farm s optimal production management and also affect optimum feed regime hence changes on the selling price of fish and costs of feeding or juveniles will affect the feeding and juvenile rate and consequently the production and benefit hebicha et al 2013 poot lópez et al 2014 the supply of low ration sizes in the face of a fixed low price scenario can provide savings in feed costs in addition to reducing discharges from nitrogenous wastes to the environment domínguez may et al 2011 poot lópez et al 2014 on the other hand market differentiation of ration and well remunerated market prices can lead to new opportunities for farmers such as distribution of products and better profits tilapia culture is a vulnerable activity among national and worldwide industries due to high input costs and low market prices olvera novoa et al 2005 in the state of yucatan mexico commercialization of tilapia is done by local trade intermediaries who buy the product from farmers at a price and or specific size therefore obtaining higher profits than producers domínguez may et al 2011 gonzález razo et al 2016 this situation is similar to that described by hishamunda and subasinghe 2003 who observed that in some of the rural areas of china the profit margin in each link of the commercial chain is from 10 to 20 where the producer is the link that obtains less profit more recently gonzález razo et al 2016 recorded a similar situation with tilapia in a case study performed in the state of mexico mexico producers capacity to negotiate more competitive prices is limited because of the lack of knowledge organization infrastructure and adequate sanitation for the product s marketing and production brummet et al 2008 this paper provides the best feeding practices for producers in this situation and compares the profitability obtained if farmers would access directly to other markets specifically the net profit increased more than 400 when the producers located in yucatan sell the product in the market of monterrey table 6 results of the optimal ration trajectories such as fixed prices independent to size of the markets of cancun and on site registered optimal ratios under markets of mexico and monterrey under variable prices the obtained results regarding the marginal growth of tilapia are positive and increasing thus achieving larger sizes exponential growth a smaller requirement of the size of the feed ration is reflected when fish increase in size brett 1979 xie et al 1997 4 4 production of sizes 200 300 and 400 g optimization of the feeding strategy not only maximizes the fish growth the feed conversion factor but can minimize the heterogeneity of sizes pollution as well as production costs schnaittacher et al 2005 domínguez may et al 2011 optimal ration stands out as a problem that has been studied in several different species ahmed 2007 khan and abidi 2010 there are however relative few studies which consider the bioeconomic and dynamic analysis relying on the size of the organisms cacho et al 1990 león et al 2006 hernández et al 2007 to our knowledge there is no study for this in tilapia bioeconomic results of this study suggest that for the production of individuals of 400 g directed to markets where prices go according to sizes the monterrey scenario offers good results meanwhile sizes of 200 and 300 g generate better benefits for the cancun market with fixed prices these same sizes were analyzed by poot lópez et al 2014 for tilapia through a study that determined the optimal combination of balanced feed and chaya or tree spinach leaves for tilapia s nutrition from a bioeconomic perspective these authors discovered that higher benefits are seen in 300 g sizes while 400 g sizes generated higher pollution of total ammonia nitrogen tan if the price is fixed it is more convenient to produce fish of 200 g sizes with market sizes 200 and 300 g be got less profitability than with 400 g but it is more sustainable ie be produce less tan by example on the site and cancun are less profitable for the producer but more sustainable for the environment manipulation of size can be employed to reach maximum production under scenarios where water temperature cannot be controlled such as in this study ahmed 2007 different fixed ration size and their influence over the optimal harvest time and environment have been studied with the purpose of discovering market strategies domínguez may et al 2011 poot lópez et al 2014 these authors have recommended the use of size ratios below of those suggested by feeding schedules which are provided by feed factories mainly for tilapia fattening the results of this work are in agreement with the conclusions of these authors likewise for the success of any commercial farm is important to adapt the knowledge to the levels of optimal ratios khan and abidi 2010 rations trajectories and optimal harvest time are influenced by prices market sizes and even the type of growth model the bieconomic analysis for management decisions will depend on the generated data of the culture species culture system management and feeding conditions site of culture among other factors 4 5 tan the dynamic optimal ration size has been widely studied in aquaculture several studies have addressed it from an economic approach arnason 1992 cacho et al 1990 esmaeili 2005 león et al 2006 hernández et al 2007 however the generated tan has not been estimated in the optimal trajectory of feeding many factors may affect tan production such as temperature salinity alkalinity fish species dissolved oxygen etc brunty et al 1997 bureau et al 2006 in this study water quality parameters were recorded in acceptable ranges for tilapia culture and they were considered as optimal poot lópez et al 2014 have shown that the optimal ration can significantly reduce the tan supply in fish farms which is confirmed in this work by assuming a dynamic optimal ration size of feeding however tan emissions mg l 1 per day in the optimal trajectory of feeding for tilapia of 200 300 and 400 g see table 6 were slightly minor to those presented by poot lópez et al 2014 these authors showed their estimations of tan in the optimal ration size considering fixed and variable prices whose standardized values for 200 300 and 400 g for tilapia were 2 29 2 94 and 3 42 and 2 16 2 94 and 3 41 mg l 1 respectively this suggests that a non constant optimal ration size throughout a culture cycle is more friendly towards the environment likewise it is clear there is a dichotomy between obtaining greater benefit and reducing contamination for example the producer can choose to produce small organisms through reducing cost and contamination in order to generate less tan in on site or cancun markets on the contrary he can choose to produce bigger fish to obtain greater benefits through sending the product to the markets of mexico or monterrey ammonia is an environmental toxicant that is especially problematic for aquatic organisms benli et al 2008 the results can help the yucatan producers to address the environmental problem thereby decreasing the ecological hardship implied by the production of tilapia however for a better comprehension of decision results where there are criteria or targets conflicting is proposed the study of trade offs using multi criteria optimization martínez cordero and leung 2004 vergara solana et al 2019 although in this study was not addressed the multiple criteria decision has been applied in recent works of cultivation of sea bream luna et al 2019a b the hydrographic basin of the yucatan shows some particular features such as a karstic type of soil which favors rainwater infiltration to the aquifer and important web of groundwater discharge in the coastal zone through springs and non point sources herrera silveira et al 2004 urban development and other productive activities that generate discharges to groundwater or the sea can produce eutrophication processes this generates a transfer of organic matter towards the bottom of the sea developing anoxic situations and can generate the flowering of toxic algae and the alteration in the structure of communities in coastal ecosystems goldberg 1995 according to results in this study total ammonia nitrogen tan accumulated per day was generally higher than 1 mg l in comparison to recommended values for tilapia culture timmons and ebeling 2010 however celik 2012 found tan values ranging from 0 9 to 1 9 mg l 1 and recommended such system as still applicable to commercial tilapia production similarly other studies have found high tan values celik 2012 rakocy et al 2004 poot lópez et al 2014 rakocy et al 2004 obtained a tan average of 1 15 and 1 85 mg l in two trials where the tan concentration reached peaks of 8 55 mg l for a short period however there was no observed mortality during this period and the feeding ration did not decline rakocy et al 2004 also it should be noted that the tan in this study was estimated from the amount of food supplied in the system it has been calculated that balanced food contributes up to 88 93 of the endogenous nitrogen generated in the system for this reason tan values show to be high in culture ponds fernandes et al 2007 ingle de la mora et al 2003 montanhini neto and ostrensky 2015 accordingly the daily water exchange and the high levels of dissolved oxygen saturation may contribute to keeping tan values low ingle de la mora et al 2003 likewise under optimal ration size it could reduce the amount of nitrogen discharged into the environment montanhini neto and ostrensky 2015 by considering optimal management strategies on aquaculture farms such as food this can promote more sustainable activity in the ecological field which can reduce production costs this means improving the competitive capacity of the farm in the production of sustainable food of high quality and reducing the risks of environmental pollution and at the same time improving the economic benefits bosma and verdegem 2011 ornelas luna et al 2017 what could offer consumers products that had in the process of production an environmental balance care feucht and zander 2015 5 conclusion this work contributes to the management on optimal feed for tilapia culture in particular the paper finds that a dynamic optimal ration size along a culture cycle this ration decreases with fish size and depends on the final harvest size and market strategy the analysis indicates that fixed prices require lesser optimal ration sizes and generate less tan whereas in variable prices upper optimal ration sizes are required and generate up tan according to our results it is recommended to focus the market strategy to distant markets variable prices and bigger sizes 400 g if a producer decides to maximize his benefits on the contrary if the producer decides to reduce contamination it is recommended to produce small sized fish 200 g and trade the fish product on the on site market the analysis for optimal ration trajectories used the optimal control theory to generate bioeconomic results data which can be useful for producers to obtain better profits by making management and food supply more efficient and thus minimizing feeding costs even though the model is simple it can be used on the industry to generate optimal ration sizes and obtain a dynamic growth however the analysis shows other limitations for example lack controlled variables such as initial culture density or other extrinsic variables as water temperature which is a stress factor that directly affects fish nutrition likewise culture cycles and optimal rotation time as well as elements of uncertainty have not been considered in this analysis these factors can be analyzed in further research projects focused on improving the economy of aquaculture on the other hand this work is focused on production systems major controlled as tank cultures and considers single batch production however for multi batch culture it is recommended to apply the same principles by each batch likewise for a better comprehension of analysis of the trade off between economic performance and environmental multiple criteria decision making optimization methodologies can be applied for a better decisions discern finally this work shows producers that it is important to know the different destination markets to direct the system to the best productive performance both biological and economic in addition by considering the optimal ration size it could reduce food costs increase economic benefits as well as reduce environmental impact however future research s directed in this line can generate more knowledge considering this topic declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a see table a1 appendix b instant ration rate the solution

24891,pinnipeds are commonly monitored using aerial photographic surveys at land or ice based sites where animals come ashore for resting pupping molting and to avoid predators although these counts form the basis for monitoring population change over time they do not provide information regarding where animals occur in the water which is often of management and conservation interest in this study we developed a hierarchical model that links counts of pinnipeds at terrestrial sites to sightings at sea and estimates abundance spatial distribution and the proportion of time spent on land attendance probability the structure of the model also allows for the inclusion of predictors that may explain variation in ecological and observation processes we applied the model to steller sea lions eumetopias jubatus in glacier bay alaska using counts of sea lions from aerial photographic surveys and opportunistic in water sightings from vessel surveys glacier bay provided an ideal test and application of the model because data are available on attendance probability based on long term monitoring we found that occurrence in the water was positively related to proximity to terrestrial sites as would be expected for a species that engages in central place foraging the proportion of sea lions in attendance at terrestrial sites and overall abundance estimates were consistent with reports from the literature and monitoring programs the model we describe has benefit and utility for park managers who wish to better understand the overlap between pinnipeds and visitors and the framework that we present has potential for application across a variety of study systems and taxa keywords hierarchical model opportunistic sightings species distribution model pinniped steller sea lion attendance probability 1 introduction characterizing the abundance and spatial distribution of animal populations is a fundamental challenge in ecology scott et al 2002 krebs 2009 the task typically involves fitting a model that relates counts or detections of animals to environmental variables to make inferences about the state of a population and the location of individuals belonging to the population hegel et al 2010 unfortunately there are common sources of sampling bias that can produce inaccurate inferences from this basic model including nondetection of animals that are actually present in the survey area gu and swihart 2004 kellner and swihart 2014 and temporary emigration of animals during periods of assumed geographic closure valente et al 2017 yamaura and royle 2017 accounting for non detection and temporary emigration is particularly important for species that are cryptic or highly mobile within the study area mackenzie et al 2002 chandler et al 2011 pinnipeds are a group of animals that typify these sampling related challenges these species are difficult to study because they are highly mobile and occupy the boundary between marine and terrestrial environments locating and enumerating animals while in the water is often considered infeasible thus population monitoring is generally carried out by counting animals at terrestrial or ice sites where animals come ashore for resting pupping molting and to avoid predators boyd et al 2010 although counts at locations on ice platforms and on land are sufficient for monitoring broad scale population change small et al 2003 mathews et al 2011 they communicate no information about the distribution of animals in the water for the cases in which in water sighting or remote tracking data are available they are often analyzed separately from spatially implicit count data gathered at fixed sites herr et al 2009 himes boor and small 2012 vincent et al 2017 the ability to assess factors that influence the in water distribution of pinnipeds is especially relevant to management and conservation because of the potential for interactions between pinnipeds and fishery operations read 2008 kovacs et al 2012 many of the challenges associated with surveying pinnipeds and synthesizing information from different data sources can be addressed by adopting a hierarchical modelling approach ver hoef and frost 2003 ver hoef et al 2014 williams et al 2017 hierarchical models represent ecological processes as latent state variables and the data obtained from surveys as a function of the true state and an incomplete and potentially misleading observation process royle and dorazio 2008 kery and schaub 2011 this approach allows parameters to be separately related to predictor variables e g sampling effort environmental attributes and facilitates the integration of multiple sources of data into a single model kery and royle 2015 integrated models use different sources of information to inform a shared set of parameters which can improve the precision of estimates fill important gaps in information and more realistically represent ecological processes schaub et al 2007 abadi et al 2010 cole and mccrea 2016 previous developments in integrated modelling have focused on estimating demographic rates from survey and mark recapture data buckland et al 2004 besbeas et al 2009 but there has also been recent progress in the development of models that incorporate different types of spatially explicit data chandler and clark 2014 nadeem et al 2016 the objective of this paper is to develop a hierarchical model for pinnipeds and similar species and to use this model to broadly characterize the abundance and distribution of steller sea lions eumetopias jubatus in glacier bay national park in southeastern alaska our approach integrates counts from aerial photographic surveys at terrestrial sites and in water sightings from vessel surveys and combines elements of n mixture models royle 2004 dail and madsen 2011 and models that use unstructured sampling approaches thompson et al 2012 russell et al 2012 broekhuis and gopalaswamy 2016 replicated counts of sea lions at terrestrial sites inform estimates of site level abundance and the probability that an individual is out of the water which we term probability of attendance in water sightings and abundance parameters are then used to estimate sighting intensity and the spatial distribution of animals we fit the model to counts from aerial photographic surveys at a terrestrial haul out site womble et al 2005 2009 mathews et al 2011 and in water sightings gathered opportunistically during vessels surveys for humpback whales megaptera novaeangliae gabriele and lewis 2012 keller et al 2016 we evaluated the performance of the model using a simple sensitivity analysis and by comparing model predictions of abundance and attendance to those reported by monitoring programs and from results derived using different methods e g tagged animals reported in the scientific literature this model is intended to form part of a larger decision tool for managing wildlife and visitor restrictions within glacier bay national park 2 methods our model is composed of two sub models that describe the abundance of pinnipeds at particular terrestrial sites and their distribution in the water based on sightings from vessels the first sub model which we term the count portion informs several key parameters 1 overall abundance of pinnipeds in the study area and 2 the probability that an animal is out of the water and thus available to be counted the second sub model which we refer to as the sighting portion uses sightings of pinnipeds in the water to describe their spatial distribution while accounting for imperfect detection and non uniform survey effort the model assumes that pinnipeds not available to be counted at terrestrial sites during aerial surveys are in the water the number of individuals in the water at a given time is derived from the count model and combined with data on in water sightings to make inferences about spatial distribution in the following sections we outline the data sets involved in the steller sea lion case study then define the structure of the model and its attributes finally we describe our procedures for fitting the model and evaluating its performance 2 1 steller sea lions in glacier bay national park steller sea lions are distributed along the north pacific rim from japan to california usa loughlin et al 1987 the species exhibits central place

of steller sea lions and the recently delisted eastern distinct population segment edps jemison et al 2013 o corry crowe et al 2014 rehberg et al 2018 we restricted our analysis of count data to terrestrial sites in the inside waters of glacier bay that were occupied consistently from may through september and where aerial photographic surveys were conducted regularly this resulted in the inclusion of south marble island a haulout site that is occupied by sea lions during may through september which coincides with the main tourist season in the glacier bay sites that were excluded were

surveys womble et al 2009 we assembled the aerial photographic counts data set by compiling 101 observations made by national park service personnel with 5 observations from the national marine fisheries service marine mammal laboratory steller sea lion count database 2009 2013 fritz et al 2015 the data set included counts of non pup steller sea lions from aerial photographic surveys from 2001 to 2017 with the exception of 2006 fig 2 aerial surveys coincided with opportunistic sightings of steller sea lions recorded during vessel surveys for humpback whales which occurred in the park annually from april through october during these surveys a small vessel 4 9 6 7 m actively searched for whales using prior knowledge of preferred habitat and visual and auditory signals from whales e g breaching and spouting the protocol for recording sightings of non target marine mammal species during surveys has remained relatively consistent through time gabriele and lewis 2000 2012 keller et al 2016 observers recorded the location and estimated group size of marine mammals that pass within 100 m of the survey vessel and make efforts to avoid double counting the study area for the spatial component of our analysis encompassed a 1332 km2 area including the entirety of glacier bay and extending slightly into icy strait to the south fig 3 we compiled sighting and track point data from 610 survey days that occurred between may and september 2006 2016 fig 3 the lack of temporal overlap between this data set and that of the aerial counts did not pose a problem because the in water sighting data set still included 10 years and our specific objective was to estimate the average in water distribution of sea lions we omitted sightings of sea lions with 20 individuals due to concerns about miscounting these sightings accounted for 0 4 of the total 2 2 model description 2 2 1 basic structure the abundance of sea lions during year i were assumed to be poisson distributed with mean and variance λ i n i p o i s λ i we modeled λ i as a log linear function of the annual site abundance parameters α i log λ i α i which were treated as fixed effects in the model i e log abundance for each year was estimated separately we linked counts of sea lions to abundance with a binomial distribution c i t b i n n i γ i t where γ i t is the probability of a sea lion being in attendance at the terrestrial site on day t of year i fig 4 by adopting this parameterization we assumed that variation in counts at sites was driven solely by changes in attendance probability and that the probability of detecting an individual sea lion given presence was equal to one we believed this assumption to be reasonable because counts were determined by scrutinizing aerial photographs rather than counting from plane or water snyder et al 2001 boyd et al 2010 we used abundance and attendance probabilities to derive the expected number of sea lions not in attendance at the terrestrial site and therefore present in the water on a given day w i t w i t λ i 1 γ i t we assumed that the population of animals in the water at a given time were distributed across j non overlaping sections each with probability of occurrence π j j 1 j π j 1 we partitioned the study area into 60 non overlapping sections by overlaying a 500 m grid on the study area and then merging cells with an area less than 12 5 km2 with their neighbors eleven of the sections were not visited by the whale survey vessel and included areas that are closed to vessels from may 1 to september 15 beardslee islands hugh miller inlet rendu inlet and adams inlet and areas in the east and upper west arms of glacier bay finally we assumed that in water sightings of sea lions in each section were linked to the expected in water abundance by a poisson distribution s i j t r p o i s w i t π j p i j t r where s i j t r is the number of sea lions sighted in year i in section j on day t and during time interval r p i j t r is the probability of detecting an individual sea lion we include the subscript r to signify that sections could be and often were visited multiple times in a day we represented sightings as a poisson process because they are rare events that occur with a frequency proportional to the expected number of sea lions present and that detection probability was tied to a measure of survey effort sea lions are highly mobile within the study area and constantly transitioning between land and water thus modelling sightings in terms of a rate of encounter was more suitable than for example apportioning the in water population at a given time across all sections using a multinomial distribution 2 2 2 incorporating predictor variables the basic model structure provided a framework for evaluating relevant predictors of ecological and observation processes additional information was included by defining parameters using linear combinations of predictors and applying appropriate link functions all linear predictors may also contain random error terms random effects at different levels however care should be taken to ensure that chosen combinations of error terms and parameters are identifiable cole and mccrea 2016 we defined mean annual abundance using fixed effects via a log link function however many alternative parameterizations for mean abundance are also possible for example it would be relatively simple to represent mean abundance using a trend line or random intercept terms as in a formal n mixture model we modeled attendance probability γ via a logit link function defined as l o g i t η 1 1 e η where η is a linear predictor e g β 0 β 1 x hereafter we denote this transformation using the left hand expression logit η to identify an appropriate model for interpretation we fit and evaluated six alternative linear predictors for attendance probability and used a model selection procedure to identify a top model candidate models included combinations linear and quadratic effects for the day of year d o y a linear effect for the number of hours before or after the nearest high tide t i d e h o u r as well as a null model all linear predictor also included a daily normal random error term meant to account for extra binomial variation τ t which may be the result of behavioral heterogeneity dorazio et al 2013 the global model with the full set of predictors was logit γ i t β 0 β 1 d o y t β 2 d o y t 2 β 3 t i d e h o u r i t τ t τ t n o r m 0 σ a t t e n d with β s denoting coefficients we hypothesized that more sea lions would be attendance at lower tide i e positive relationship with the number of hours to closest high tide as this would relate to there being more space on land on which to haul out it should be noted that the t i d e h o u r is measured at a finer scale than d o y and known for all aerial counts and all survey intervals indexed by r thus inclusion of this predictor would result in sub daily predictions of in water abundance attendance probability was the only parameter for which we compared alternative sets of predictors we related the distribution of sea lions across sections to several predictors using a multinomial logit link function agresti 2013 royle and converse 2014 where probability of occurrence for all but one of the sections j 1 is defined as π j e θ z j 1 j 1 j 1 e θ z j j 1 2 3 j 1 and π j serves as a reference category section specific probability of occurrence is defined by a linear combination with one or more coefficients θ and section specific variables z similar to above we denote this transformation using the left hand expression m l o g i t η j where η j is the section specific linear predictor given that steller sea lions are central place foragers we hypothesized that probability of occurrence in the study area was inversely related to the distance to sites where sea lions are known to haul out of the water we used distance to south marble island as a predictor of probability of occurrence in the water in addition to including a site that is occupied throughout the year we included distance to a seasonally occupied terrestrial site at point carolus near the mouth of glacier bay fig 2 the function used to describe section specific occurrence probability π j was as follows mlogit π j θ 1 d s o u t h m a r b l e i s l a n d j θ 2 d p o i n t c a r o l u s j where θ s are slope coefficients and d is a function that describes the distance in kilometers between the centroid of a survey cell and each of the two sites the section nearest to point carolus served as the reference category in the model we modeled the probability of the survey vessel detecting a sea lion using a logit linear regression with search time t i m e in each section as a predictor logit p i j t r δ 0 δ 1 t i m e i j t r ε i j t r ε i j t r n o r m 0 σ d e t e c t i o n where δ s are coefficients and ε t r is a random error term meant to account for additional observation error we computed the time spent in each section by summarizing time stamped vessel tracking data 2 3 model fitting we fit the model using a likelihood based approach which entailed using optimization to identify the set of parameters that jointly maximize the likelihood of the observed data a bayesian approach could also be used to estimate parameters as with all hierarchical models cressie et al 2009 we calculated the joint likelihood for all data and parameters in the integrated model by combining the likelihood contributions of the count and in water sighting portions of the model into a single objective function we accomplished this by defining the objective function to be minimized as the sum of the negative log likelihood contributions of the two portions of the model l 1 and l 2 l t o t a l l 1 l 2 where l t o t a l is the joint likelihood to be minimized using an optimization procedure we carried out the analysis in the r statistical platform using the template model builder tmb package a tool that interprets user defined c model templates and uses automatic differentiation to efficiently compute the derivatives of a joint likelihood function while also enabling random effects to be estimated via the laplace approximation kristensen et al 2015 r core team 2017 for clarity and because they are integrated out during model fitting we ignore the random effects in the notation to compute the likelihood contribution of the count portion of the model we marginalized over the joint binomial poisson likelihood this process entailed summing the likelihood values over a wide range of possible abundances for each year in the manner shown below l 1 l o g i 1 i n i max c i k t 1 t i b i n c i t n i γ t p o i s n i λ i where l 1 is negative log likelihood component for the count portion of the model i is the number of years k is the upper bound used for n t i is the number of replicate counts on the i th year we examined the influence of our choice of k by comparing joint likelihood values and abundance estimates over a range of values ultimately deciding that a value of 15 000 was suitably large dennis et al 2014 we computed the negative log likelihood component for the in water sighting portion of the model more simply as the product of likelihood of all sighting records assuming a poisson distribution l 2 l o g i 1 i j 1 j t 1 t r 1 r p o i s s i j t r w i t π j p i j t r minimization of the objective function was performed using the base non linear optimization function nlminb to facilitate convergence we normalized predictor variables for attendance probability and detection effort and estimated σ parameters on the log scale 2 3 1 attendance probability γ model selection as noted above we were interested in identifying a top model or models on which to base inferences about the sea lion population in glacier bay we ranked six different candidate models using akaike information criterion aic these models represented six alternative sets of predictors defining attendance probability all other sets of predictors were held constant we based our determination of a suitable top model on recommendations of burnham and anderson 2002 and we considered models within the 2 0 aic of the top model as competitive 2 3 2 model evaluation after identifying a top model for interpretation we evaluated its performance using a simple sensitivity analysis and by comparing model predictions of abundance and attendance probability to those reported in the literature we were interested in examining the effect that inclusion of sighting data would have on predictions of abundance and attendance so we compared predictions from the final model with those of a reduced version of the model in which we omitted in water sighting data this comparison enabled us to examine the influence of the in water sighting data on both the estimated relationships and the precision of estimates we compared model estimates of abundance to indices of abundance from monitoring surveys past studies estimated attendance probabilities by making detailed observations at haulouts or by affixing tags to sea lions some of which were equipped to record the time spent in the water merrick and loughlin 1997 milette 1999 rehberg andrews et al 2009 rehberg et al 2018 although many of these studies focused on the foraging behavior primarily from postpartum or lactating females at breeding sites we assumed that attendance estimates of this age sex class would provide an indication of the model s realism the estimated coefficients and associated uncertainty were also used in determining the degree to which the model reasonably reflected abundance distribution and sighting processes 3 results we successfully fit the pinniped abundance and distribution model to the glacier bay sea lion data to the six different candidate models model selection using aic suggested substantial support for the two models containing quadratic day of year effects including the global model and a model with only a quadratic day of year effect table 1 we chose to interpret the model ranked second which described only the quadratic day of year effect logit γ i t β 0 β 1 d o y t β 2 d o y t 2 τ t we based this decision on the recommendation of burnham and anderson 2002 that if two competing models differ by one parameter and the difference in likelihoods is minimal then the model with fewer parameters is preferred this decision was further justified by the observation that the 95 confidence interval for the t i d e h o u r coefficient in the global model overlapped zero and was in the direction opposite that which we had hypothesized our selected model produced parameter estimates that appeared to reasonably describe the population trend at terrestrial sites and in water distribution of steller sea lions the model indicated that sea lion abundance at south marble island increased over the study period from 2001 to 2017 table 2 fig 5 the overall abundance and attendance patterns were similar for the fully integrated model compared to the reduced version that relied solely on aerial counts abundance estimates were more precise for the reduced version model however the fully integrated model was able to estimate the annual abundance for 2006 based on in water sighting data alone attendance probability predictions were comparable for the models with and without in water sighting data although predictions from the fully integrated model were more precise fig 6 estimated attendance probability began at 30 in may peaked at the end of june at 73 and then declined to 31 by the end of august fig 6 there was considerable uncertainty in these estimates however with the 95 confidence interval for attendance probability spanning values from 37 to 67 for the entire season may august estimates for attendance coefficients were also more precise for the combined model table 2 time that a survey vessel spent in the section was found to be positively related to the probability of detection of an individual sea lion table 2 the coefficient for the effect of search time indicated that odds of sighting an individual sea lion increased by 51 32 73 95 lcl ucl for every 30 min that the survey vessel was present the estimated effect of predictor variables on occurrence and detection probability matched our hypotheses and were consistent with central place foraging behavior coefficients for the effect of distance to south marble island and secondary sites were both significantly less than zero suggesting that the geographic location of the site influenced the in water distribution of sea lions table 2 however the effect of proximity to point carolus was greater and more precisely estimated than at south marble island interpretation of distribution coefficients is somewhat difficult considering that the two predictor variables are based on the distance to two different sites and are thus non independent the clearest possible interpretation of the coefficients comes from computing an odds ratio for the slope terms separately and expressing changes in the odds of occurrence as a percentage 100 1 e θ based on this approach odds of a sea lion being present in a cell diminish by 3 5 and 5 6 with every kilometer traveled from south marble island and point carolus respectively the influence of these parameters on prediction is more easily interpretable however by examining a map of in water occurrence probability π across the study area fig 7 this map describes the probabilities that a given sea lion in the water would be found in each cell those not in the water are assumed to be present at south marble island table 3 the abundance and attendance probability estimates were comparable to those reported in the literature the pattern of increasing abundance at south marble island was consistent with the findings of mathews et al 2011 during the period when the two studies overlapped however there were decreases in estimated abundance in 2016 and 2017 that differed from the trend line reported by mathews et al 2011 attendance probabilities reported in previous studies fell within the range estimated by our model for example merrick and loughlin 1997 rehberg et al 2009 and milette 1999 reported that female steller sea lions spent on average 47 52 and 59 of their time on land respectively the main discrepancies between our model predictions and previous work were related to seasonal patterns in attendance several studies that analyzed counts of steller sea lions at south marble island in the early 2000s described a bimodal pattern with peaks in the spring and fall womble et al 2009 mathews et al 2011 in contrast our model estimated a mid season peak in attendance mid june to mid july 4 discussion the objective of this study was to develop a pinniped abundance and distribution model for situations in which both in water sighting information and counts at terrestrial sites are available we used a hierarchical modelling framework to accomplish this task which consisted of separating ecological and sampling related processes into separate tiers of a model and then specifying intuitive connections between data sets and a shared set of parameters royle and dorazio 2008 cressie et al 2009 the key assumption linking these data sets was that attendance at a terrestrial site and availability to be sighted in the water were mutually exclusive states we demonstrated the utility of this framework by applying it to steller sea lions in glacier bay alaska the clearest benefits of our approach were improved precision in attendance predictions the ability to estimate abundance for 2006 in lieu of any aerial count data and the ability to characterize in water density of sea lions in the bay over the course of the spring and summer model predictions of abundance and attendance probabilities showed general agreement with the range of estimates reported in the literature it bears mentioning however that the attendance probability estimates to which we compared our model outputs were obtained from studies that took place at different times of year different geographic areas and a limited sex and age range of sea lions merrick and loughlin 1997 milette 1999 rehberg et al 2009 the greatest inconsistency between our findings and previous research was with respect to seasonal attendance patterns at south marble island womble et al 2009 mathews et al 2011 our model identified a convex seasonal attendance relationship for the time span from 2001 to 2017 whereas these other studies described patterns with relatively low mid season attendance at the same location from 2001 to 2004 the inconsistency was somewhat surprising considering that all analyses shared at least some of the same aerial count data we did not regard the difference between our model and these other studies as indicative of poor performance considering that our model included counts from thirteen additional years it is possible that the attendance pattern identified for the early 2000s has since shifted and that our model instead detected a prevailing pattern with a mid season peak a shift to a mid season peak in attendance is reasonable considering that it would coincide with the onset of pupping a period when both males and females would be expected to spend more time ashore the abundance and distribution model that we describe in this paper combines elements from several modelling approaches specifically n mixture and spatial capture recapture models and may be applied to other taxa the count portion of the model broadly resembles an n mixture model in that counts at terrestrial sites are viewed as a binomial random variable and a function of the underlying abundance parameter the traditional n mixture model uses replicated counts to simultaneously estimate detection probability and abundance assuming that nondetection is the sole explanation for the variation in observed counts in contrast our model assumes perfect detection and attributes variation in counts to changes in the availability of individuals to be counted by an aerial survey i e temporary emigration availability and its compliment temporary emigration are sometimes viewed as nuisance parameters in hierarchical models because they can be used to account for transitions of individuals into unobservable states kendall and nichols 2002 kery and royle 2015 we thought it more appropriate to apply the term attendance probability for this model because transitions occur between two observable states water and land and the term attendance is commonly used in the pinniped literature to refer to occurrence at a terrestrial site milette and trites 2003 meise et al 2014 although this study focuses on developing a model for monitoring pinnipeds this or a similar framework could also be applied to other species seabird species are one such candidate for this type of model because they aggregate at terrestrial breeding colony sites where they may be easily counted but are also sightable from vessels during foraging trips at sea although our model uses only counts of unmarked unidentifiable individuals the sighting portion of the model bears some resemblance to spatial capture recapture models spatial capture recapture models relate observations of animals to their distance from an estimated activity center and derive abundance estimates by summing the number of such centers in the study area royle et al 2013 royle and converse 2014 the sighting portion of the pinniped model can be parameterized in a manner that is conceptually similar specifically when distance to the terrestrial site is used as a predictor of distribution in water in this case the location of activity centers is fixed at terrestrial sites rather than estimated and the number of such centers is also informed by the count sub model another way in which our model broadly relates to spatial capture recapture approaches is in its reliance on unstructured spatial sampling in which surveyors roam the study area recording animal sightings or scats thompson et al 2012 broekhuis and gopalaswamy 2016 some models that rely on unstructured surveys are also defined using spatial capture recapture terminology even referring to grid cells as conceptual traps russell et al 2012 our approach does not build individual encounter histories from sightings in cells as these models do but instead uses replicate visits and measures of effort within grid cells to provide information regarding detection and occurrence probability the realism and utility of the model that we describe is predicated on assumptions regarding latent ecological and data collection processes many of which it inherits from the approaches that we discussed above the most significant assumption of the model is that the population remains closed during each season and that variation in counts only reflects changes in attendance probability and not for example imperfect detection or movement of individuals among sites dénes et al 2015 violation of this assumption is likely to result in additional heterogeneity in the attendance parameter which could obscure relevant patterns in the attendance process and lead to positive bias in abundance estimates barker et al 2017 duarte et al 2018 another key assumption of the model is that the spatial extent of the study area encompasses the home range within which pinnipeds travel during each season and does not overlap with the home ranges of populations at other terrestrial sites if the second assumption is violated then estimates of individual detection probability will be affected as well as abundance estimates the sighting portion of the model assumes that counts of animals in cells are independent after adjusting for covariate effects the pinniped species is not miscounted or misidentified by surveyors and that pinnipeds are neither avoidant of nor attracted to the survey vessel an additional assumption of unstructured sampling approaches is that survey routes are independent of the density thompson et al 2012 the data used in the steller sea lion case study satisfied the model assumptions reasonably well considering our objective of broadly characterizing trends in abundance and spatial distribution there are several important aspects of sea lion ecology however that are not captured by the model and some assumptions could not be assessed we could not readily assess the geographic closure assumptions because of the paucity of detailed movement or demographic information on the south marble island population over the study period however some degree of within season movement among nearby sites was likely based on previous studies jemison et al 2013 2018 rehberg et al 2018 we also assumed that sightings of individuals were independent although steller sea lions are known to forage and are sighted in groups fiscus and baines 1966 gende et al 2001 sigler et al 2004 the greater estimated effect of proximity to point carolus relative to that of south marble island was another unexpected result from the model this was surprising considering that substantially fewer sea lions have been observed hauled out at point carolus relative to south marble island the most likely explanation is that distance to point carolus is correlated with a latent variable that also predicts the in water occurrence of sea lions most likely having to do with prey availability and productive foraging conditions in this region near the mouth of glacier bay sea lions have been observed in the vicinity point carolus in late summer and autumn which coincides with the migration of pacific salmon oncorhynchus spp through cross sound and icy strait from the gulf of alaska womble et al 2009 in addition a shallow glacial sill at the mouth of glacier bay promotes localized upwelling and increased productivity in the sitkaday narrows an area of intense tidal currents and mixing etherington et al 2007 in addition most of the water that is entrained into glacier bay comes in on the west side of the mouth producing a headland wake system that has been positively related to quality of foraging habitat for whales chenoweth et al 2011 and fish schools and groups of sea lions are commonly observed near point carolus during aerial surveys jamie womble personal observation a major advantage of hierarchical models is that there are a number of extensions to the model that can be made to improve estimates and confront potential assumption violations with respect to the sea lion case study there are additional sources of information that could be leveraged to improve the model for example uncertainties regarding inter seasonal movement among sites could be reduced by incorporating transition probability estimates obtained via telemetry rehberg et al 2018 or mark resight studies jemison et al 2013 the precision of the model could also be improved by incorporating additional types of data including counts of pups or observations gathered using more error prone methods e g counts from vessels provided that an additional detection parameter be included in the model the issue of non independent sightings could be addressed by directly modelling the process that determines group size martin et al 2011 schmidt and rattenbury 2018 this study illustrates the value of a hierarchical modelling approach for characterizing abundance and spatial distribution when multiple data sources are available this approach is particularly useful for pinniped monitoring programs because of the behavioral complexity of these animals and the expense and logistical challenges associated with conducting population surveys ver hoef and frost 2003 boyd et al 2010 the modelling framework presented in this paper provides a method for supplementing these surveys with spatially explicit in water sighting data and for creating model based predictions that provide a full accounting of where populations of pinnipeds occur on land and in the water without the integrated model for steller sea lion in glacier bay it would not have been possible abundance estimate for 2006 or to have identified a seasonal attendance pattern that will be instrumental for reconstructing in water density patterns across all study years another possible management application for this type of model would be for estimating the degree of overlap between pinnipeds and commercial fishing operations based on the location and occupancy status at terrestrial haul out sites furthermore species with similar ecology and types of monitoring

24891,pinnipeds are commonly monitored using aerial photographic surveys at land or ice based sites where animals come ashore for resting pupping molting and to avoid predators although these counts form the basis for monitoring population change over time they do not provide information regarding where animals occur in the water which is often of management and conservation interest in this study we developed a hierarchical model that links counts of pinnipeds at terrestrial sites to sightings at sea and estimates abundance spatial distribution and the proportion of time spent on land attendance probability the structure of the model also allows for the inclusion of predictors that may explain variation in ecological and observation processes we applied the model to steller sea lions eumetopias jubatus in glacier bay alaska using counts of sea lions from aerial photographic surveys and opportunistic in water sightings from vessel surveys glacier bay provided an ideal test and application of the model because data are available on attendance probability based on long term monitoring we found that occurrence in the water was positively related to proximity to terrestrial sites as would be expected for a species that engages in central place foraging the proportion of sea lions in attendance at terrestrial sites and overall abundance estimates were consistent with reports from the literature and monitoring programs the model we describe has benefit and utility for park managers who wish to better understand the overlap between pinnipeds and visitors and the framework that we present has potential for application across a variety of study systems and taxa keywords hierarchical model opportunistic sightings species distribution model pinniped steller sea lion attendance probability 1 introduction characterizing the abundance and spatial distribution of animal populations is a fundamental challenge in ecology scott et al 2002 krebs 2009 the task typically involves fitting a model that relates counts or detections of animals to environmental variables to make inferences about the state of a population and the location of individuals belonging to the population hegel et al 2010 unfortunately there are common sources of sampling bias that can produce inaccurate inferences from this basic model including nondetection of animals that are actually present in the survey area gu and swihart 2004 kellner and swihart 2014 and temporary emigration of animals during periods of assumed geographic closure valente et al 2017 yamaura and royle 2017 accounting for non detection and temporary emigration is particularly important for species that are cryptic or highly mobile within the study area mackenzie et al 2002 chandler et al 2011 pinnipeds are a group of animals that typify these sampling related challenges these species are difficult to study because they are highly mobile and occupy the boundary between marine and terrestrial environments locating and enumerating animals while in the water is often considered infeasible thus population monitoring is generally carried out by counting animals at terrestrial or ice sites where animals come ashore for resting pupping molting and to avoid predators boyd et al 2010 although counts at locations on ice platforms and on land are sufficient for monitoring broad scale population change small et al 2003 mathews et al 2011 they communicate no information about the distribution of animals in the water for the cases in which in water sighting or remote tracking data are available they are often analyzed separately from spatially implicit count data gathered at fixed sites herr et al 2009 himes boor and small 2012 vincent et al 2017 the ability to assess factors that influence the in water distribution of pinnipeds is especially relevant to management and conservation because of the potential for interactions between pinnipeds and fishery operations read 2008 kovacs et al 2012 many of the challenges associated with surveying pinnipeds and synthesizing information from different data sources can be addressed by adopting a hierarchical modelling approach ver hoef and frost 2003 ver hoef et al 2014 williams et al 2017 hierarchical models represent ecological processes as latent state variables and the data obtained from surveys as a function

variables e g sampling effort environmental attributes and facilitates the integration of multiple sources of data into a single model kery and royle 2015 integrated models use different sources of information to inform a shared set of parameters which can improve the precision of estimates fill important gaps in information and more realistically represent ecological processes schaub et al 2007 abadi et al 2010 cole and mccrea 2016 previous developments in integrated modelling have focused on estimating demographic rates from survey and mark recapture data buckland et al 2004 besbeas et al 2009 but there has also been recent progress in the development of models that incorporate different types of spatially explicit data chandler and clark 2014 nadeem et al 2016 the objective of this paper is to develop a hierarchical model for pinnipeds and similar species and to use this model to broadly characterize the abundance and distribution of steller sea lions eumetopias jubatus in glacier bay national park in southeastern alaska our approach integrates counts from aerial photographic surveys at terrestrial sites and in water sightings from vessel surveys and combines elements of n mixture models royle 2004 dail and madsen 2011 and models that use unstructured sampling approaches thompson et al 2012 russell et al 2012 broekhuis and gopalaswamy 2016 replicated counts of sea lions at terrestrial sites inform estimates of site level abundance and the probability that an individual is out of the water which we term probability of attendance in water sightings and abundance parameters are then used to estimate sighting intensity and the spatial distribution of animals we fit the model to counts from aerial photographic surveys at a terrestrial haul out site womble et al 2005 2009 mathews et al 2011 and in water sightings gathered opportunistically during vessels surveys for humpback whales megaptera novaeangliae gabriele and lewis 2012 keller et al 2016 we evaluated the performance of the model using a simple sensitivity analysis and by comparing model predictions of abundance and attendance to those reported by monitoring programs and from results derived using different methods e g tagged animals reported in the scientific literature this model is intended to form part of a larger decision tool for managing wildlife and visitor restrictions within glacier bay national park 2 methods our model is composed of two sub models that describe the abundance of pinnipeds at particular terrestrial sites and their distribution in the water based on sightings from vessels the first sub model which we term the count portion informs several key parameters 1 overall abundance of pinnipeds in the study area and 2 the probability that an animal is out of the water and thus available to be counted the second sub model which we refer to as the sighting portion uses sightings of pinnipeds in the water to describe their spatial distribution while accounting for imperfect detection and non uniform survey effort the model assumes that pinnipeds not available to be counted at terrestrial sites during aerial surveys are in the water the number of individuals in the water at a given time is derived from the count model and combined with data on in water sightings to make inferences about spatial distribution in the following sections we outline the data sets involved in the steller sea lion case study then define the structure of the model and its attributes finally we describe our procedures for fitting the model and evaluating its performance 2 1 steller sea lions in glacier bay national park steller sea lions are distributed along the north pacific rim from japan to california usa loughlin et al 1987 the species exhibits central place foraging behavior and typically aggregates at rocky sites and islands from which they radiate and feed primarily on marine fishes and invertebrates womble and sigler 2006 fritz et al 2015 sites may be occupied throughout the year or seasonally sease and york 2003 with seasonal movements driven by life history events e g pupping breeding and shifts in prey resources womble et al 2005 2009 in alaska steller sea lions give birth to pups from mid june to early july steller sea lions have garnered considerable conservation attention in the last several decades due to population declines trites and donnelly 2003 the species occurs in two distinct population segments the western distinct population segment west of 144 w which is listed as endangered and the eastern distinct population segment which was delisted in 2013 national marine fisheries service 2013 allen and angliss 2015 the glacier bay region represents a mixing zone between the endangered western distinct population segment wdps of steller sea lions and the recently delisted eastern distinct population segment edps jemison et al 2013 o corry crowe et al 2014 rehberg et al 2018 we restricted our analysis of count data to terrestrial sites in the inside waters of glacier bay that were occupied consistently from may through september and where aerial photographic surveys were conducted regularly this resulted in the inclusion of south marble island a haulout site that is occupied by sea lions during may through september which coincides with the main tourist season in the glacier bay sites that were excluded were graves rocks a rookery along the outer coast of glacier bay and several sites tarr inlet gloomy knob harbor point cape fairweather and point carolus that are typically occupied during other times or year or for briefer time periods fig 1 south marble island was initially colonized by sea lions around 1985 and was initially occupied only seasonally however since approximately 2001 steller sea lions have been present at south marble island throughout the year womble et al 2005 2009 mathews et al 2011 from 2001 2004 the number of steller sea lions at terrestrial sites in glacier bay were monitored during monthly aerial photographic surveys womble et al 2005 2009 beginning in 2005 sea lions were only monitored during june and august in conjunction with harbor seal aerial photographic surveys womble et al 2009 we assembled the aerial photographic counts data set by compiling 101 observations made by national park service personnel with 5 observations from the national marine fisheries service marine mammal laboratory steller sea lion count database 2009 2013 fritz et al 2015 the data set included counts of non pup steller sea lions from aerial photographic surveys from 2001 to 2017 with the exception of 2006 fig 2 aerial surveys coincided with opportunistic sightings of steller sea lions recorded during vessel surveys for humpback whales which occurred in the park annually from april through october during these surveys a small vessel 4 9 6 7 m actively searched for whales using prior knowledge of preferred habitat and visual and auditory signals from whales e g breaching and spouting the protocol for recording sightings of non target marine mammal species during surveys has remained relatively consistent through time gabriele and lewis 2000 2012 keller et al 2016 observers recorded the location and estimated group size of marine mammals that pass within 100 m of the survey vessel and make efforts to avoid double counting the study area for the spatial component of our analysis encompassed a 1332 km2 area including the entirety of glacier bay and extending slightly into icy strait to the south fig 3 we compiled sighting and track point data from 610 survey days that occurred between may and september 2006 2016 fig 3 the lack of temporal overlap between this data set and that of the aerial counts did not pose a problem because the in water sighting data set still included 10 years and our specific objective was to estimate the average in water distribution of sea lions we omitted sightings of sea lions with 20 individuals due to concerns about miscounting these sightings accounted for 0 4 of the total 2 2 model description 2 2 1 basic structure the abundance of sea lions during year i were assumed to be poisson distributed with mean and variance λ i n i p o i s λ i we modeled λ i as a log linear function of the annual site abundance parameters α i log λ i α i which were treated as fixed effects in the model i e log abundance for each year was estimated separately we linked counts of sea lions to abundance with a binomial distribution c i t b i n n i γ i t where γ i t is the probability of a sea lion being in attendance at the terrestrial site on day t of year i fig 4 by adopting this parameterization we assumed that variation in counts at sites was driven solely by changes in attendance probability and that the probability of detecting an individual sea lion given presence was equal to one we believed this assumption to be reasonable because counts were determined by scrutinizing aerial photographs rather than counting from plane or water snyder et al 2001 boyd et al 2010 we used abundance and attendance probabilities to derive the expected number of sea lions not in attendance at the terrestrial site and therefore present in the water on a given day w i t w i t λ i 1 γ i t we assumed that the population of animals in the water at a given time were distributed across j non overlaping sections each with probability of occurrence π j j 1 j π j 1 we partitioned the study area into 60 non overlapping sections by overlaying a 500 m grid on the study area and then merging cells with an area less than 12 5 km2 with their neighbors eleven of the sections were not visited by the whale survey vessel and included areas that are closed to vessels from may 1 to september 15 beardslee islands hugh miller inlet rendu inlet and adams inlet and areas in the east and upper west arms of glacier bay finally we assumed that in water sightings of sea lions in each section were linked to the expected in water abundance by a poisson distribution s i j t r p o i s w i t π j p i j t r where s i j t r is the number of sea lions sighted in year i in section j on day t and during time interval r p i j t r is the probability of detecting an individual sea lion we include the subscript r to signify that sections could be and often were visited multiple times in a day we represented sightings as a poisson process because they are rare events that occur with a frequency proportional to the expected number of sea lions present and that detection probability was tied to a measure of survey effort sea lions are highly mobile within the study area and constantly transitioning between land and water thus modelling sightings in terms of a rate of encounter was more suitable than for example apportioning the in water population at a given time across all sections using a multinomial distribution 2 2 2 incorporating predictor variables the basic model structure provided a framework for evaluating relevant predictors of ecological and observation processes additional information was included by defining parameters using linear combinations of predictors and applying appropriate link functions all linear predictors may also contain random error terms random effects at different levels however care should be taken to ensure that chosen combinations of error terms and parameters are identifiable cole and mccrea 2016 we defined mean annual abundance using fixed effects via a log link function however many alternative parameterizations for mean abundance are also possible for example it would be relatively simple to represent mean abundance using a trend line or random intercept terms as in a formal n mixture model we modeled attendance probability γ via a logit link function defined as l o g i t η 1 1 e η where η is a linear predictor e g β 0 β 1 x hereafter we denote this transformation using the left hand expression logit η to identify an appropriate model for interpretation we fit and evaluated six alternative linear predictors for attendance probability and used a model selection procedure to identify a top model candidate models included combinations linear and quadratic effects for the day of year d o y a linear effect for the number of hours before or after the nearest high tide t i d e h o u r as well as a null model all linear predictor also included a daily normal random error term meant to account for extra binomial variation τ t which may be the result of behavioral heterogeneity dorazio et al 2013 the global model with the full set of predictors was logit γ i t β 0 β 1 d o y t β 2 d o y t 2 β 3 t i d e h o u r i t τ t τ t n o r m 0 σ a t t e n d with β s denoting coefficients we hypothesized that more sea lions would be attendance at lower tide i e positive relationship with the number of hours to closest high tide as this would relate to there being more space on land on which to haul out it should be noted that the t i d e h o u r is measured at a finer scale than d o y and known for all aerial counts and all survey intervals indexed by r thus inclusion of this predictor would result in sub daily predictions of in water abundance attendance probability was the only parameter for which we compared alternative sets of predictors we related the distribution of sea lions across sections to several predictors using a multinomial logit link function agresti 2013 royle and converse 2014 where probability of occurrence for all but one of the sections j 1 is defined as π j e θ z j 1 j 1 j 1 e θ z j j 1 2 3 j 1 and π j serves as a reference category section specific probability of occurrence is defined by a linear combination with one or more coefficients θ and section specific variables z similar to above we denote this transformation using the left hand expression m l o g i t η j where η j is the section specific linear predictor given that steller sea lions are central place foragers we hypothesized that probability of occurrence in the study area was inversely related to the distance to sites where sea lions are known to haul out of the water we used distance to south marble island as a predictor of probability of occurrence in the water in addition to including a site that is occupied throughout the year we included distance to a seasonally occupied terrestrial site at point carolus near the mouth of glacier bay fig 2 the function used to describe section specific occurrence probability π j was as follows mlogit π j θ 1 d s o u t h m a r b l e i s l a n d j θ 2 d p o i n t c a r o l u s j where θ s are slope coefficients and d is a function that describes the distance in kilometers between the centroid of a survey cell and each of the two sites the section nearest to point carolus served as the reference category in the model we modeled the probability of the survey vessel detecting a sea lion using a logit linear regression with search time t i m e in each section as a predictor logit p i j t r δ 0 δ 1 t i m e i j t r ε i j t r ε i j t r n o r m 0 σ d e t e c t i o n where δ s are coefficients and ε t r is a random error term meant to account for additional observation error we computed the time spent in each section by summarizing time stamped vessel tracking data 2 3 model fitting we fit the model using a likelihood based approach which entailed using optimization to identify the set of parameters that jointly maximize the likelihood of the observed data a bayesian approach could also be used to estimate parameters as with all hierarchical models cressie et al 2009 we calculated the joint likelihood for all data and parameters in the integrated model by combining the likelihood contributions of the count and in water sighting portions of the model into a single objective function we accomplished this by defining the objective function to be minimized as the sum of the negative log likelihood contributions of the two portions of the model l 1 and l 2 l t o t a l l 1 l 2 where l t o t a l is the joint likelihood to be minimized using an optimization procedure we carried out the analysis in the r statistical platform using the template model builder tmb package a tool that interprets user defined c model templates and uses automatic differentiation to efficiently compute the derivatives of a joint likelihood function while also enabling random effects to be estimated via the laplace approximation kristensen et al 2015 r core team 2017 for clarity and because they are integrated out during model fitting we ignore the random effects in the notation to compute the likelihood contribution of the count portion of the model we marginalized over the joint binomial poisson likelihood this process entailed summing the likelihood values over a wide range of possible abundances for each year in the manner shown below l 1 l o g i 1 i n i max c i k t 1 t i b i n c i t n i γ t p o i s n i λ i where l 1 is negative log likelihood component for the count portion of the model i is the number of years k is the upper bound used for n t i is the number of replicate counts on the i th year we examined the influence of our choice of k by comparing joint likelihood values and abundance estimates over a range of values ultimately deciding that a value of 15 000 was suitably large dennis et al 2014 we computed the negative log likelihood component for the in water sighting portion of the model more simply as the product of likelihood of all sighting records assuming a poisson distribution l 2 l o g i 1 i j 1 j t 1 t r 1 r p o i s s i j t r w i t π j p i j t r minimization of the objective function was performed using the base non linear optimization function nlminb to facilitate convergence we normalized predictor variables for attendance probability and detection effort and estimated σ parameters on the log scale 2 3 1 attendance probability γ model selection as noted above we were interested in identifying a top model or models on which to base inferences about the sea lion population in glacier bay we ranked six different candidate models using akaike information criterion aic these models represented six alternative sets of predictors defining attendance probability all other sets of predictors were held constant we based our determination of a suitable top model on recommendations of burnham and anderson 2002 and we considered models within the 2 0 aic of the top model as competitive 2 3 2 model evaluation after identifying a top model for interpretation we evaluated its performance using a simple sensitivity analysis and by comparing model predictions of abundance and attendance probability to those reported in the literature we were interested in examining the effect that inclusion of sighting data would have on predictions of abundance and attendance so we compared predictions from the final model with those of a reduced version of the model in which we omitted in water sighting data this comparison enabled us to examine the influence of the in water sighting data on both the estimated relationships and the precision of estimates we compared model estimates of abundance to indices of abundance from monitoring surveys past studies estimated attendance probabilities by making detailed observations at haulouts or by affixing tags to sea lions some of which were equipped to record the time spent in the water merrick and loughlin 1997 milette 1999 rehberg andrews et al 2009 rehberg et al 2018 although many of these studies focused on the foraging behavior primarily from postpartum or lactating females at breeding sites we assumed that attendance estimates of this age sex class would provide an indication of the model s realism the estimated coefficients and associated uncertainty were also used in determining the degree to which the model reasonably reflected abundance distribution and sighting processes 3 results we successfully fit the pinniped abundance and distribution model to the glacier bay sea lion data to the six different candidate models model selection using aic suggested substantial support for the two models containing quadratic day of year effects including the global model and a model with only a quadratic day of year effect table 1 we chose to interpret the model ranked second which described only the quadratic day of year effect logit γ i t β 0 β 1 d o y t β 2 d o y t 2 τ t we based this decision on the recommendation of burnham and anderson 2002 that if two competing models differ by one parameter and the difference in likelihoods is minimal then the model with fewer parameters is preferred this decision was further justified by the observation that the 95 confidence interval for the t i d e h o u r coefficient in the global model overlapped zero and was in the direction opposite that which we had hypothesized our selected model produced parameter estimates that appeared to reasonably describe the population trend at terrestrial sites and in water distribution of steller sea lions the model indicated that sea lion abundance at south marble island increased over the study period from 2001 to 2017 table 2 fig 5 the overall abundance and attendance patterns were similar for the fully integrated model compared to the reduced version that relied solely on aerial counts abundance estimates were more precise for the reduced version model however the fully integrated model was able to estimate the annual abundance for 2006 based on in water sighting data alone attendance probability predictions were comparable for the models with and without in water sighting data although predictions from the fully integrated model were more precise fig 6 estimated attendance probability began at 30 in may peaked at the end of june at 73 and then declined to 31 by the end of august fig 6 there was considerable uncertainty in these estimates however with the 95 confidence interval for attendance probability spanning values from 37 to 67 for the entire season may august estimates for attendance coefficients were also more precise for the combined model table 2 time that a survey vessel spent in the section was found to be positively related to the probability of detection of an individual sea lion table 2 the coefficient for the effect of search time indicated that odds of sighting an individual sea lion increased by 51 32 73 95 lcl ucl for every 30 min that the survey vessel was present the estimated effect of predictor variables on occurrence and detection probability matched our hypotheses and were consistent with central place foraging behavior coefficients for the effect of distance to south marble island and secondary sites were both significantly less than zero suggesting that the geographic location of the site influenced the in water distribution of sea lions table 2 however the effect of proximity to point carolus was greater and more precisely estimated than at south marble island interpretation of distribution coefficients is somewhat difficult considering that the two predictor variables are based on the distance to two different sites and are thus non independent the clearest possible interpretation of the coefficients comes from computing an odds ratio for the slope terms separately and expressing changes in the odds of occurrence as a percentage 100 1 e θ based on this approach odds of a sea lion being present in a cell diminish by 3 5 and 5 6 with every kilometer traveled from south marble island and point carolus respectively the influence of these parameters on prediction is more easily interpretable however by examining a map of in water occurrence probability π across the study area fig 7 this map describes the probabilities that a given sea lion in the water would be found in each cell those not in the water are assumed to be present at south marble island table 3 the abundance and attendance probability estimates were comparable to those reported in the literature the pattern of increasing abundance at south marble island was consistent with the findings of mathews et al 2011 during the period when the two studies overlapped however there were decreases in estimated abundance in 2016 and 2017 that differed from the trend line reported by mathews et al 2011 attendance probabilities reported in previous studies fell within the range estimated by our model for example merrick and loughlin 1997 rehberg et al 2009 and milette 1999 reported that female steller sea lions spent on average 47 52 and 59 of their time on land respectively the main discrepancies between our model predictions and previous work were related to seasonal patterns in attendance several studies that analyzed counts of steller sea lions at south marble island in the early 2000s described a bimodal pattern with peaks in the spring and fall womble et al 2009 mathews et al 2011 in contrast our model estimated a mid season peak in attendance mid june to mid july 4 discussion the objective of this study was to develop a pinniped abundance and distribution model for situations in which both in water sighting information and counts at terrestrial sites are available we used a hierarchical modelling framework to accomplish this task which consisted of separating ecological and sampling related processes into separate tiers of a model and then specifying intuitive connections between data sets and a shared set of parameters royle and dorazio 2008 cressie et al 2009 the key assumption linking these data sets was that attendance at a terrestrial site and availability to be sighted in the water were mutually exclusive states we demonstrated the utility of this framework by applying it to steller sea lions in glacier bay alaska the clearest benefits of our approach were improved precision in attendance predictions the ability to estimate abundance for 2006 in lieu of any aerial count data and the ability to characterize in water density of sea lions in the bay over the course of the spring and summer model predictions of abundance and attendance probabilities showed general agreement with the range of estimates reported in the literature it bears mentioning however that the attendance probability estimates to which we compared our model outputs were obtained from studies that took place at different times of year different geographic areas and a limited sex and age range of sea lions merrick and loughlin 1997 milette 1999 rehberg et al 2009 the greatest inconsistency between our findings and previous research was with respect to seasonal attendance patterns at south marble island womble et al 2009 mathews et al 2011 our model identified a convex seasonal attendance relationship for the time span from 2001 to 2017 whereas these other studies described patterns with relatively low mid season attendance at the same location from 2001 to 2004 the inconsistency was somewhat surprising considering that all analyses shared at least some of the same aerial count data we did not regard the difference between our model and these other studies as indicative of poor performance considering that our model included counts from thirteen additional years it is possible that the attendance pattern identified for the early 2000s has since shifted and that our model instead detected a prevailing pattern with a mid season peak a shift to a mid season peak in attendance is reasonable considering that it would coincide with the onset of pupping a period when both males and females would be expected to spend more time ashore the abundance and distribution model that we describe in this paper combines elements from several modelling approaches specifically n mixture and spatial capture recapture models and may be applied to other taxa the count portion of the model broadly resembles an n mixture model in that counts at terrestrial sites are viewed as a binomial random variable and a function of the underlying abundance parameter the traditional n mixture model uses replicated counts to simultaneously estimate detection probability and abundance assuming that nondetection is the sole explanation for the variation in observed counts in contrast our model assumes perfect detection and attributes variation in counts to changes in the availability of individuals to be counted by an aerial survey i e temporary emigration availability and its compliment temporary emigration are sometimes viewed as nuisance parameters in hierarchical models because they can be used to account for transitions of individuals into unobservable states kendall and nichols 2002 kery and royle 2015 we thought it more appropriate to apply the term attendance probability for this model because transitions occur between two observable states water and land and the term attendance is commonly used in the pinniped literature to refer to occurrence at a terrestrial site milette and trites 2003 meise et al 2014 although this study focuses on developing a model for monitoring pinnipeds this or a similar framework could also be applied to other species seabird species are one such candidate for this type of model because they aggregate at terrestrial breeding colony sites where they may be easily counted but are also sightable from vessels during foraging trips at sea although our model uses only counts of unmarked unidentifiable individuals the sighting portion of the model bears some resemblance to spatial capture recapture models spatial capture recapture models relate observations of animals to their distance from an estimated activity center and derive abundance estimates by summing the number of such centers in the study area royle et al 2013 royle and converse 2014 the sighting portion of the pinniped model can be parameterized in a manner that is conceptually similar specifically when distance to the terrestrial site is used as a predictor of distribution in water in this case the location of activity centers is fixed at terrestrial sites rather than estimated and the number of such centers is also informed by the count sub model another way in which our model broadly relates to spatial capture recapture approaches is in its reliance on unstructured spatial sampling in which surveyors roam the study area recording animal sightings or scats thompson et al 2012 broekhuis and gopalaswamy 2016 some models that rely on unstructured surveys are also defined using spatial capture recapture terminology even referring to grid cells as conceptual traps russell et al 2012 our approach does not build individual encounter histories from sightings in cells as these models do but instead uses replicate visits and measures of effort within grid cells to provide information regarding detection and occurrence probability the realism and utility of the model that we describe is predicated on assumptions regarding latent ecological and data collection processes many of which it inherits from the approaches that we discussed above the most significant assumption of the model is that the population remains closed during each season and that variation in counts only reflects changes in attendance probability and not for example imperfect detection or movement of individuals among sites dénes et al 2015 violation of this assumption is likely to result in additional heterogeneity in the attendance parameter which could obscure relevant patterns in the attendance process and lead to positive bias in abundance estimates barker et al 2017 duarte et al 2018 another key assumption of the model is that the spatial extent of the study area encompasses the home range within which pinnipeds travel during each season and does not overlap with the home ranges of populations at other terrestrial sites if the second assumption is violated then estimates of individual detection probability will be affected as well as abundance estimates the sighting portion of the model assumes that counts of animals in cells are independent after adjusting for covariate effects the pinniped species is not miscounted or misidentified by surveyors and that pinnipeds are neither avoidant of nor attracted to the survey vessel an additional assumption of unstructured sampling approaches is that survey routes are independent of the density thompson et al 2012 the data used in the steller sea lion case study satisfied the model assumptions reasonably well considering our objective of broadly characterizing trends in abundance and spatial distribution there are several important aspects of sea lion ecology however that are not captured by the model and some assumptions could not be assessed we could not readily assess the geographic closure assumptions because of the paucity of detailed movement or demographic information on the south marble island population over the study period however some degree of within season movement among nearby sites was likely based on previous studies jemison et al 2013 2018 rehberg et al 2018 we also assumed that sightings of individuals were independent although steller sea lions are known to forage and are sighted in groups fiscus and baines 1966 gende et al 2001 sigler et al 2004 the greater estimated effect of proximity to point carolus relative to that of south marble island was another unexpected result from the model this was surprising considering that substantially fewer sea lions have been observed hauled out at point carolus relative to south marble island the most likely explanation is that distance to point carolus is correlated with a latent variable that also predicts the in water occurrence of sea lions most likely having to do with prey availability and productive foraging conditions in this region near the mouth of glacier bay sea lions have been observed in the vicinity point carolus in late summer and autumn which coincides with the migration of pacific salmon oncorhynchus spp through cross sound and icy strait from the gulf of alaska womble et al 2009 in addition a shallow glacial sill at the mouth of glacier bay promotes localized upwelling and increased productivity in the sitkaday narrows an area of intense tidal currents and mixing etherington et al 2007 in addition most of the water that is entrained into glacier bay comes in on the west side of the mouth producing a headland wake system that has been positively related to quality of foraging habitat for whales chenoweth et al 2011 and fish schools and groups of sea lions are commonly observed near point carolus during aerial surveys jamie womble personal observation a major advantage of hierarchical models is that there are a number of extensions to the model that can be made to improve estimates and confront potential assumption violations with respect to the sea lion case study there are additional sources of information that could be leveraged to improve the model for example uncertainties regarding inter seasonal movement among sites could be reduced by incorporating transition probability estimates obtained via telemetry rehberg et al 2018 or mark resight studies jemison et al 2013 the precision of the model could also be improved by incorporating additional types of data including counts of pups or observations gathered using more error prone methods e g counts from vessels provided that an additional detection parameter be included in the model the issue of non independent sightings could be addressed by directly modelling the process that determines group size martin et al 2011 schmidt and rattenbury 2018 this study illustrates the value of a hierarchical modelling approach for characterizing abundance and spatial distribution when multiple data sources are available this approach is particularly useful for pinniped monitoring programs because of the behavioral complexity of these animals and the expense and logistical challenges associated with conducting population surveys ver hoef and frost 2003 boyd et al 2010 the modelling framework presented in this paper provides a method for supplementing these surveys with spatially explicit in water sighting data and for creating model based predictions that provide a full accounting of where populations of pinnipeds occur on land and in the water without the integrated model for steller sea lion in glacier bay it would not have been possible abundance estimate for 2006 or to have identified a seasonal attendance pattern that will be instrumental for reconstructing in water density patterns across all study years another possible management application for this type of model would be for estimating the degree of overlap between pinnipeds and commercial fishing operations based on the location and occupancy status at terrestrial haul out sites furthermore species with similar ecology and types of monitoring data available e g sea birds may also benefit from the application of this framework credit authorship contribution statement steven l whitlock conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing

24892,it is commonly accepted that the processes determining how plant groundwater interactions influence vegetation patterns depend on subsurface properties including groundwater availability but not much is known about the underlying processes we present a hybrid process based simulation system to study the feedback between vegetation and subsurface hydrodynamics using mangroves as an example our approach relies on first principles rather than on empirical competition concepts we develop a modular tool which dynamically couples an agent based vegetation model to a continuum groundwater model the vegetation model describes individual trees and their interactions within their environment and communities we show the dependence of the salinity distribution on aquifer properties within stylized case studies moreover the model predicts varying tree allometries depending on variations of subsurface properties finally we analyze the nature of belowground competition for fresh water as a direct consequence of the plant soil feedback that is inherent to the modelling approach the results show that the interaction of vegetation and subsurface hydrodynamics is crucial for vegetation zonation patterning in form of a pronounced distribution of tree allometry we also discuss the benefits and disadvantages of our presented plant soil feedback modelling approach as well as its implications for future research keywords mangroves groundwater vegetation subsurface coupling mechanistic plant soil feedback belowground competition 1 introduction 1 1 motivation understanding the feedback mechanisms between vegetation structure and soil properties is a perennial favorite in ecology since it is key to understand plant systems functioning many studies have shown that the spatial heterogeneity of resources in the soil such as nutrients or water controls competitive or facilitative interactions between plants additionally it influences both community structure and zonation patterns which robertson et al 1993 expressed in gradual changes of species composition or allometry it is reasonable to assume that plant soil interactions are significant in various environmental settings however they are particularly pronounced under conditions where a shortage of belowground resources controls observable vegetation patterns as in semiarid habitats peat bogs or coastal zones see fowler 1986 thiery et al 1995 berger et al 2008a b rietkerk and van de koppel 2008 getzin et al 2016 and references within for example empirical studies on plant soil interactions zonation and spatial self organization in real plant systems are still limited despite the abundant theoretical literature on this topic there is at least one exception to this in mangrove forests examples of pattern formations have been documented over many decades and it has been shown that regular patterns in this ecosystem are a frequent phenomenon rather than a peculiarity see lugo 1980 santos et al 1997 dahdouh guebas et al 2004 piou et al 2006 cohen et al 2018 ellison 2000 and examples presented in the two reviews of ellison 2000 and kathiresan and bingham 2001 the reason behind this exception in mangrove forests is a combination of factors i mangroves occur in sub tropical intertidal zones often exposed to pronounced gradients in salinity due to the inundation regime ii mangrove trees are physiologically adapted to inundation and can occur in a wide range of the salinities 5 to 90 ball 1996 mediated by changes in their hydraulic architecture minimizing the risk of embolism under water stress conditions lovelock et al 2006 and the extension of roots into more favorable soil water resources greaver and sternberg 2006 to name a few the strongest zonation pattern however either in species distribution or in tree allometry and architecture observable in monospecific stands emerges on steeper gradients cf fig 1 i or on the extreme ends of salinity or flooding gradients ball 1998 suggesting that abiotic factors are likely to be the most important drivers underlying factors and mechanism of zonation suggested are geomorphology semeniuk 1983 thom 1967 inundation classes watson 1928 physiological responses to gradients propagule sorting rabinowitz 1978 seed predation smith 1987 and succession processes after disturbances such as hurricanes piou et al 2006 imai et al 2006 all of which often superimpose such that their particular impact is hard to be separated from each other since the site conditions geomorphology hydrological boundary conditions and inundation frequency and amplitude have a strong impact on the spatial distribution of porewater salinity distribution fig 1i smith 1992 suggested these salinity gradients are the principal link between subsurface hydrology and mangrove zonation patterns on the single plant and plant community scale it is known that the plants water use reduces with increasing salt stress yan and guizhu 2007 patel et al 2010 concurrently the transpiration of the plants affects porewater salinities fig 1ii consequently the plant soil feedback between porewater salinity and mangrove water uptake represents an important interface between abiotic site conditions and plant growth patterns the emergence of species specific or allometric zonation patterns can only be reliably modeled when the coupled ecosystem and these interactions are described with a mechanistically coupled hydrodynamic groundwater mangrove stand model using such a model vegetation zonation patterns and their disturbances should even be attributable to subsurface heterogeneity fig 1 within this work we introduce the manga model that follows a concept based on first principles we verify the applicability of the model on a number of stylized setups showing the feasibility and benefits to use the mechanistical approach which inherently supports belowground competition for water without the necessity of any additional phenomenological description of competition effects as all existing models do we also discuss the suitability of our approach to investigate the plant porewater salinity feedbacks in mangrove forests due to the chosen mechanistic modelling approach and the fact that salinity stress has similar physiological effects on plant growth as drought stress we are convinced that our model cannot only provide a versatile tool to support mangrove restoration and recovery projects in future but stimulate further studies focusing on plant groundwater feedbacks in other vegetation systems 1 2 theoretical background plant soil feedbacks in mangroves have been identified as important factors for ecosystem stability against environmental drivers like sea level rise kumara et al 2010 huxham et al 2010 recently various studies aimed to advance insights about the underlying mechanisms governing those feedbacks lovelock et al 2015 mckee et al 2007 more specifically a better understanding of the role of mangrove water uptake in the porewater salinity distribution and the resulting feedback on mangrove forest zonation has been gained hereby considerable effort has been focused on the dependence of forest species composition and tree allometry distribution on groundwater salinity various authors measure an influence of porewater salinity gradients on species distribution joshi et al 2003 piou et al 2006 teh et al 2015 considered the influence of species specific water uptake rates on resulting porewater salinity and the possibilities of regime shifts from one species dominating the forest composition to another species taking this role peters et al 2014 were able to show salinity dependence of tree allometry by introducing a mechanistic model for tree water uptake and tree growth behavior those results are supported by empirical findings naidoo 2006 mitra et al 2011 other studies focus on the implications of mangrove ecosystem characteristics on surface hydrology mazda et al 2005 moreover transport and dispersion of chemical and biological material and its consequences for biomass and energy in the food web have been studied using a coupled model mazda and wolanski 2009 however mazda and wolanski 2009 do not explicitly model individual tree growth which is necessary to study the implications of subsurface and surface hydrology on individual mangrove growth to our knowledge a full mechanistic coupling approach between agent based mangrove stand models and porewater salinity dynamics is still missing in literature at this time although some studies have already introduced a feedback of individual plant water uptake and growth to groundwater dynamics jiang et al 2012 sternberg et al 2007 teh et al 2015 here we apply agent based modelling approaches and incorporate first principles to describe the model dynamics use of first principles in agent based modelling increases model flexibility facilitates predictions under new ecological conditions and allows insights to be gained regarding the interplay of driving forces in an ecological system grimm and berger 2016 the aim of our new model is to increase the understanding of the mechanistic interplay and the emerging feedback dynamics of porewater salinity and mangrove vegetation zonation patterning one possible outcome of this approach is the emergence of tree tree interactions such as competition for resources from first principles rather than imposing those interactions implicitly in this study we subdivide the feedback in two components in the first component the hydrological salinity dynamics in the porewater is described and vegetation dynamics are grouped in the second component in hydrology subsurface water in permanently saturated pore space is called groundwater i e there are only solid and liquid phases but without the presence of air within this study we assume saturated conditions up to the soil surface consequently the term groundwater is used synonymously for subsurface water finite element methods are widely applied in groundwater flow process modelling after their first introduction into this research field in the 1980s narasimhan and

mechanical chemical processes in porous and fractured media to model the abiotic hydrological dynamics of porewater salinity in the past this tool has been successfully applied in studies dealing with water resource management kalbacher et al 2012 and for coupling with various additional simulation tools kalbacher et al 2010 he et al 2015 jing et al 2018 additionally ogs has been used to investigate saltwater dynamics in coastal aquifers walther et al 2012 2014 most mangrove models do not quantify single plant water uptake although their variety is extensive to our knowledge only a few attempts exist to connect groundwater and vegetation models the manham model sternberg et al 2007 jiang et al 2012 is one of those attempts and distinguishes between mangrove and freshwater hammock vegetation it takes into account the water balance at a vegetation patch by estimating precipitation evaporation and transpiration the individual tree dynamics within the manham model incorporate the approaches of the kiwi model berger and hildenbrandt 2000 teh et al 2015 combined the vegetation approach of the manham model and the sutra hydrodynamic groundwater flow model in their mantra model mantra allowed for a more realistic description of the subsurface processes and prediction of salinity distributions in a vegetation patch both models account for freshwater intrusion in the vadose zone and the resulting change in porewater salinity distribution additionally mixing of vadose zone porewater and seawater by means of tidal dynamics is studied these models also consider plant transpiration dependence on porewater salinity competition for resources between neighboring trees in mangrove forests are typically treated via the field of neighborhood concept fon as introduced in berger and hildenbrandt 2000 depending on its size the plant is characterized by a rotationally symmetric field describing the strength of resource demand overlapping fields restrict the resource availability of competing plants among the models available in literature only the single tree model bettina peters et al 2014 accounts for dependence of individual tree allometry on groundwater salinity moreover in order to mechanistically describe the water fluxes within plants peters et al 2014 introduce the concept of plant water potential for quantifying tree water uptake the osmotic potential of the porewater controls the water uptake and thus the water extraction from the subsurface bettina is an agent based mangrove model providing an intrinsic interface to a hydrodynamic groundwater model further the bettina model mechanistically describes the allometric plasticity depending on the porewater salinity distribution peters et al 2018 employed the model to show the impact of the allometric plasticity on the self thinning characteristics at varying porewater salinity distributions these features of bettina appear to be essential for i providing a plant

introduce our coupling strategy and the two submodels then the specific model coupling scheme is explained 2 1 model coupling and model documentation the implementation of the mechanistically coupled simulation tool manga including the feedback between two very distinct types of systems requires a flexible coupling framework to facilitate model development we use already existing models by implementing them as submodules to our software package modular approaches for simulation toolboxes are widely used in hydrogeological modelling e g fischer et al 2015 horgue et al 2014 foglia et al 2018 this approach allows developers to take advantage of performed work on model verification within each submodule modular code structures also provide frameworks and allow future applications through exchange or extension of individual modules sustainable model development has been proven crucial in the context of model reusability ram 2013 in the past ongoing effort on introducing standard protocols for model documentation was taken model reproducibility is one of the key motivations for acceptable model documentation for agent based population models the odd standard protocol is widely accepted and has been improved over more than a decade grimm et al 2006 2010 2017 grimm and railsback 2012 additionally transparent source code development facilitates model reproduction application and modification within the community as a consequence usage of version control software tools in scientific modelling is increasing a widely applied tool is the distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development and coordination in collaborative software development git blischak et al 2016 ram 2013 the aspects listed above and regarded during manga model development align with the recommendations given in belete et al 2017 the manga model is outlined in the following section a full documentation following the odd standard is provided in the supplementary material all source code is version controlled and available to the community as an open source git version controlled project 3 2 2 modelling approaches of the individual models 2 2 1 porewater salinity dynamics ogs to explain the relationship between vegetation patterns and three dimensional hydrodynamic processes we have to consider temporal scales of decades up to at least some 100 years and spatial dimensions of hectares porewater salinity distributions in turn can vary on timescales of hours to days to keep the computational costs manageable we consider saturated flow i e the sediment pores only contain water and no air the limitations of this assumption in mangroves is discussed later following diersch and kolditz 2002 the porewater salinity dynamics are described by a system of partial differential equations starting from mass and momentum conservation within the system phenomenological laws of fickian type dispersive mass flux the bear scheidegger dispersion relationship and newton s viscosity law are used additionally porewater density is regarded as a function of pressure and porewater salinity only moreover the porewater is taken as incompressible with constant dynamic viscosity the interfacial drag term of momentum exchange is approximated up to second order in bulk flow velocity within the momentum balance inertia is neglected and forces are accounted for up to linear order in bulk velocity the resulting total porewater mass flow in a three dimensional aquifer domain ω reads 1 ϕ ρ r p p t ϕ ρ r s s t κ μ ρ r p

access 27 12 2019 2 2 2 mangrove model bettina the general interplay of allometric tree measures physiological parameters and resource limitation within bettina is given in the supplementary material water dynamics within single trees in bettina are modeled as follows the water uptake q is calculated starting from darcy s law for laminar flow of water volume 5 q δ ψ r with potential difference δψ and flow resistance along the flow path r here δψ is the difference between the leaf water potential and the sum of height potential of the leaf and osmotic potential of the porewater hence environmental factors tree allometry and species specific parameters are considered bettina does not explicitly model salt absorption and exclusion mechanisms thus there is no species specific consideration this implies the assumption of negligible effect of those mechanisms on considered temporal and spatial scales so far bettina parametrization is based on avicennia germinans the resistance r in turn is a function which depends on tree geometry such as stem height stem radius root zone and crown geometry as well as on species specific parameters such as xylem conductivity and fine root permeability resources are distributed through a specified ratio hence the available resources for the tree are attributed to a limiting resource either water uptake q or the available light bettina does not account for the influence of nutrient availability the available resources are used for maintenance of the living biomass proportional to the trees volume and growth within tree growth resources available for growth are allocated in order to optimize resource uptake by facilitating uptake of the limiting kind of resource for more detailed explanations see peters et al 2014 and peters et al 2018 and the supplementary material in order to model tree populations we combine several trees which are described by the bettina model the interaction of trees within our approach can only manifest itself in competition for resources shadowing effects between different individuals are taken into account we do not explicitly introduce a competition scheme for water uptake since trees indirectly compete by local change of environmental conditions porewater salinity in the vicinity of their roots which is modeled in detail by the coupling to ogs 2 3 implementation of the model coupling mangrove stand and porewater salinity dynamics have distinct temporal scales groundwater dynamics on the spatial scales of several hectares take place on timescales from seconds to hours vegetation dynamics is typically modeled with time steps varying from months to years in our approach the latter defines the frequency of transfer of information between the two distinct models ogs often requires finer time stepping than bettina between bettina timesteps all information about the mangrove population i e the boundary conditions within the ogs setup stays constant while ogs is calculating the change in porewater salinity distribution bettina then uses the calculated information on porewater salinity distribution to update the mangrove population in its next time step the implemented coupling cycle for system dynamics after setup initialization reads 1 bettina evolves and updates every tree fig 2 i 2 information on plant distribution and individual specific allometric measures is saved in distinct boundary grids which are passed to ogs hereby eq 5 is applied to dynamically update the neumann type boundary conditions for bulk flow velocity eq 3 defined at the tree root meshes abiotic external drivers can also be included using boundary grids fig 2ii 3 ogs calculates the development of porewater salinity within the setup under consideration of all biotic and abiotic external drivers fig 2iii 4 states of porewater salinity distribution within the aquifer are saved at dynamical adapting frequencies which orient on the change rate of porewater salinity distribution fig 2iv 3 model application we study the mechanism connecting mangrove water uptake and porewater salinity distribution in stylized scenario setups subsequently we investigate the effect on resource acquisition of tree communities emerging from the implemented plant soil feedback a simple vegetation setup consists of one tree located at a point r on the surface of a three dimensional aquifer domain ω environmental factors like tidal activity and precipitation are not considered since we focus on the implications of plant water use additionally the aquifer domain ω is defined to be homogeneous with respect to the aquifers permeability κ introducing a hydraulic gradient i x leads to a constant groundwater flow using this setup the dependence of the groundwater salinity distribution and tree model dynamics on the parameters i aquifer permeability and ii hydraulic gradient can be investigated by parameter variation the smallest possible setup of interacting trees consists of two individuals hence we add a second tree to the scenario described above to examine the tree tree interactions both trees are located in one streamline by variation of the distance between the two trees the strength and nature of competition for belowground resources is analyzed fig 3 the aquifer domain ω extensions x 0 l x 0 l y l z 0 is represented using a 3 dimensional grid with resolution of a characteristic length scale of 1 m in the x y plane in the vicinity of trees the grid is refined up to the characteristic length scale of 0 3 r r with r r denoting the root radius in the vertical direction five layers are considered with a four times higher resolution at the surface than at the bottom of the aquifer within this stylized case study we update the tree population monthly i e information between the two submodels is exchanged every month the initial distributions for pressure p i and salinity s i are set as 6 s i x s x y z t 0 s 0 and 7 p i x p x y z t 0 ρ g z where g is the gravitational constant for both scenarios no flow boundary conditions for both variables pressure and salinity are imposed along the y and z axis a constant horizontal hydraulic gradient i x induces background bulk flow pressure boundary conditions g p for the left uppercase l and right uppercase r boundaries are given as 8 g d l p p i x 0 y z 9 g n r p κ μ ρ r 2 g i x with constant dynamic viscosity μ and homogeneous permeability tensor κ salinity boundary conditions g s read 10 g d l s s 0 11 g d r s s 0 the boundary conditions describing tree fresh water uptake at the root uppercase t read 12 g n t p ρ r δ ψ r this boundary condition represents the extraction of fresh water from the saline water body as described in peters et al 2018 in our setup the boundary conditions g d l s g d r s g d l p and g n r p fully define the environmental conditions for the groundwater dynamics g d l p defines the pressure on the left boundary of the setup domain representing a constant pressure head on the landward boundary of a saturated groundwater body g n r p denotes the bulk flow out of the domain over its right boundary this boundary condition is applied in order to impose groundwater flow velocities resulting from the gravitational force the salinity values on those two boundaries are set as constant using g d l s and g d r s representing the inflow of water with a certain salinity and the outflow to a similar water body e g the outflow of water into the open sea in general one can incorporate other environmental factors such as tidal activity and precipitation by defining additional boundary conditions representing those phenomena for the sake of simplicity and conceptual analysis our setup only incorporates the background flow as described above values for ogs parameterization i e the parameters defining groundwater flow used to generate the following example simulations are given in table 1 and are inspired using the results of schwendenmann and riecke 2006 and tait et al 2016 in this stylized model application we choose an aquifer depth of 1 5 m in order to represent a shallow mangrove aquifer as observed in schwendenmann and riecke 2006 values for molecular diffusion dynamic viscosity and reference density are aligned with standard values for distilled water at room temperature we simplify the groundwater dynamics by assuming salinity independent groundwater density values for the permeability and the hydraulic gradient vary within the range of measurement results presented in schwendenmann and riecke 2006 we designed the horizontal extent of our setup in a way that boundary effects on the trees are minimized the order of magnitude for transverse and longitudinal dispersion coefficients is given by numerical restrictions and are adapted from pool and carrera 2011 model parameters for the tree modeled by bettina are given in the supplementary material and taken from the original bettina single tree model parametrization peters et al 2014 for a germinans 3 1 single tree scenario at simulation start a tree sapling is planted at the domain surface with five meters distance to the inflow and the lateral boundaries and 15 m distance to the outflow boundary fig 3 in order to investigate the influence of aquifer permeability values and the hydraulic gradient n 30 numerical experiments have been performed varying those parameters after 50 years simulation time the salinity along the flow direction at 15 cm depth is observed a characteristic shape for the salinity distribution within the aquifer as shown in fig 4 i is observed for all parameters tested directly in the root zone the salinity increases along flow direction downstream to the tree an effect of increased salinity in the porewater occurs until the effect of the dirichlet boundary condition dominates the measurements at the outflow boundary increase of salinity within the root region is observed for all used parameter setups after 50 years simulation time as shown in fig 4ii iii the root zone is defined by the intersection of the aquifer domain ω and cylinder around the tree center with radius r s r r with r r denoting the trees root radius lower mean salinities within the root zone are observed with the increase of both aquifer permeability and hydraulic gradient fig 4ii hereby within the range of parameters tested a five times larger permeability leads to a decrease of salinity by roughly 25 additionally a threefold increased hydraulic gradient reduces the root zone salinity by approximately 10 an increase of initial salinity s 0 leads to an increase in root zone salinity fig 4iii trees in a setup with s 0 95 do not persist for 50 years in fig 4iv the result for tree height measurements are presented as shown increasing permeabilities or increasing hydraulic gradients lead to an increase in total tree height after 50 years simulation time the measure is sensitive to both parameters tested increase of hydraulic gradients leads to an increase in reached total tree height similarly the correlation between total tree height and permeability is positive comparison of the crown area with root area shows an allometric response of the tree growth to varying subsurface properties fig 4v vi with lower permeability as well as low hydraulic gradients the tree allocates more resources into root growth than into crown growth leading to a decreasing fraction between the respective areas higher initial salinities lead to more resource allocation in root growth resulting in a lower crown to root area fraction 3 2 two tree scenario as second application a second tree is added to the setup described above the tree located upstream is called first tree in the following the other tree is called second tree the second tree is located downstream to the first with varying distance d fig 5 i the groundwater flow domain is extended by d in the flow direction such that the distance between the absorbing dirichlet boundary and the second tree stays constant n 40 numerical experiments have been performed with distances varying from 0 25 to 10 m the values for aquifer permeability κ 2 5 1 10 11 m2 hydraulic gradient i x 1 2 10 3 and simulation time t 50 years are kept constant an example for resulting salinity distributions measured after 50 years simulation time in 15 cm depth on the transect plane is shown in fig 5i a characteristic shape has been observed for all tested values of d showing the resulting shape as the combination of the individual salinity distributions induced by each individual tree fig 5ii shows the mean salinity within the root zone defined above vs the reference value obtained from the corresponding results of the one tree setup for both trees the mean salinity is increased a range of approximately 4 m can be observed for the first tree until the effect of salinity increase by the presence on the second tree is negligible a small jump in the root zone salinities for both trees can be observed at the same distance mean salinity within the root zone of the second tree is increased for all tested values of d relative to the reference tree with the maximum of root zone salinization at approximately 4 m distance between the tree centers the reduction in total reached tree height is shown in fig 5ii a reduction of tree growth for the first tree can be observed within the range of 4 m the effect of tree growth reduction is decreasing with increasing distance between the trees from a reached height of 83 of the reference measure at distance d 0 25 m to a vanishing effect e g same total tree height as measured in the reference setup decrease of tree growth varying from 77 to 88 of the reference value for the second tree is observed within the results of all performed numerical experiments this effect is decreasing with increasing distance between the trees the measured crown to root ratio of both trees is divided by the reference ratio in fig 5iv for both trees a reduction of this allometric measure is observed a value below one indicates increased resource allocation to root growth relative to the reference tree for the first tree the same range of effect of tree distances up to 4 m can be observed the minimum value for the allometric measure of the first tree is 75 increased allocation of resources to root growth is observed for all tested values of d for the second tree here the minimum of the fraction of 68 is measured at d 1 m 4 discusssion to the best of our knowledge the manga model is the first simulation model which describes plant groundwater feedbacks according to first principles and is thus explicitly mechanistic the model is a hybrid linking an agent based vegetation model bettina with a continuous groundwater model ogs the model was firstly applied to mangroves because this ecosystem is characterized by pronounced zonation patterns in both species distributions and patterns in the allometry of one particular species which provides extraordinary possibilities to evaluate the suitability of the model to capture the underlying mechanisms correctly allometric patterns were addressed by the simulation experiments performed the single tree setup showed an influence of subsurface properties on groundwater salinity distributions and tree growth behavior results obtained using the two tree model system provide insights into the mechanisms governing belowground competition for resources in mangroves based on first principles following emerging effects of soil parameters on the modelled plant soil feedback have been shown within the single tree setup aquifers with low soil permeabilities result in higher mean salinities in the root zones with increasing soil permeabilities higher groundwater flow velocities occur and therefore the salt accumulated at tree roots is carried away more easily hence the established equilibrium salt concentration decreases with higher values of subsurface permeability the same mechanism explains reduced mean salinity values within the root zone for higher hydraulic gradients with increasing permeability and increasing hydraulic gradients equally parameterized trees become taller within the same amount of time the tree growth is reduced by increasing groundwater salinity which is a result of soil parameter dependent equilibrium groundwater salinities an effect of subsurface properties on the emerging allometry of our model trees has been shown the reduced ratio of crown area to root area with reduced groundwater flow velocities low hydraulic gradients and or low permeability values and therefore higher salinities within the root zones of the trees can be understood by analyzing the growth behavior of the bettina model in situations where the porewater salinity is high a tree within the bettina model allocates resources such that porewater is more accessible e g a larger root area facilitates water uptake this observation is also in line with the original description of the solitaire bettina model peters et al 2014 within the model framework qualitative agreement with the observed relations between the growth behavior of trees and initial salinities i e different mangrove systems like delta systems or tropical dry regions are reproduced due to the growth dynamics within the bettina model trees directly react to salinity by variation of their growth behavior hence trees allocate more resources in root growth within saline than in brackish conditions the model presented here shows effects of the positioning of a tree within its environment by analyzing the emerging interaction of two trees resulting porewater salinity distributions within a two tree setup emerge partly from the superposition of their individually induced effects on water uptake in the presented groundwater salinity distribution along a transect line at 15 cm depth fig 5i two maxima can be observed each of those maxima represents the peak of the groundwater salinity distribution induced by individual trees in this numerical experiment the water uptake of the second tree and therefore the increase in groundwater salinity is lower due to the higher background salinity within its root zone induced by the first tree the increase of salinity within the root zone for the two trees shown in fig 5ii shows dependence of the tree positioning relative to each other for the first tree the presence of the second tree can only be measured up to a distance corresponding to approximately two times the root radius in contrast the root zone of the second tree has increased salinity for all tested distances between the trees since less saline water from the inflow boundary reaches the first tree firstly the effect of increased salinity is always lower for this tree after a threshold distance between the trees is reached the increasing effect of the second tree on porewater salinity is not affecting the region of the first tree by means of diffusion and dispersion hence the second tree s presence has no influence on the porewater salinity distribution within the first tree s root zone fig 5iii and iv some shortcomings within the model design exist due to simplifications here we explicitly discuss some of the model s assumptions listed in the main body and the appendix of this work the assumption of saturated soil conditions is important to keep computation cost for the groundwater submodel low this simplification implies that water saturation in the soil does not limit plant growth which we can assume in mangrove ecosystems in principle it would be possible to extend the current model coupling such that both sub models calculate and evaluate water saturation in the soil extensions to the groundwater model further increase model runtimes our approach to use a deterministic model to depict belowground dynamics however already leads to increased model runtimes compared to traditional belowground competition approaches e g fon thus reducing model usability furthermore we currently do not consider geochemical reactions e g redox reactions and multi component transport reaction processes e g transformation of nutrients in the presence of nutrient scarcity or important geochemical reactions however modifications for both the tree and groundwater model are possible see e g he et al 2015 due to the modularity of our coupling approach it is even possible to exchange the tree or groundwater model for an approach that is capable to meet aforementioned potential requirements i e variable saturated soil or geochemical reactions the current setups also do not account for any dilution effect at the ground surface e g precipitation or tidal dynamics and the role of crab burrows for water infiltration the incorporation of precipitation and tidal dynamics is neglected here in order to be able to directly analyze the feedback model although those drivers also influence the manifestation of the analyzed plant soil feedback for preliminary investigations on how changes in tidal amplitude and incursion into the mangrove forest affect the plant soil feedback time dependent boundary conditions 5 5 https www opengeosys org docs benchmarks python bc hertz contact hertz contact last access 20 12 2019 can be included in the groundwater model furthermore our model could be extended by incorporating models available in the literature as provided by mazda and wolanski 2009 taking advantage of our modular approach mazda and ikeda 2006 proposed how crab burrows affect soil permeabilities using their results the influence of crab burrows can be explicitly modelled with inhomogeneous soil permeability distributions within our approach in future investigations using first principles less assumptions drawn from empiric measurements are used eventually resulting in more reliable model results we can use more mechanistic relations and rely less on empirical based but phenomenological assumptions still model parametrization remains challenging the emerging interaction between the trees and the porewater dynamics provides insights into the mechanisms driving the plant soil feedback based on first principles grimm and berger 2016 only plant water uptake and the associated salinity increase was imposed the emerging interaction of trees can be interpreted as outcome of competition for water which is usually modelled implicitly berger and hildenbrandt 2000 we were able to show that competition for resources fresh water in this case is a direct consequence of the mechanism described by the model for this reason we are convinced that the developed hybrid modelling approach is an important step forward towards the description of plant water feedbacks beyond the chosen mangrove system 5 conclusions this work presents the coupling of an agent based mechanistic tree model to a complex groundwater flow and transport model so far recent approaches to model the plant groundwater salinity feedback in mangrove ecosystems have used plant models which did not consider varying tree allometry jiang et al 2012 sternberg et al 2007 teh et al 2015 the semi mechanistic approach by peters et al 2014 was able to explain varying tree allometry but it did not account for dynamic environmental conditions as a result of tree water uptake or explain plant soil feedbacks by using an approach based on first principles we were able to address these shortcomings the introduced model delivers a novel approach to study the characteristics of different types of mangrove zonation patterns e g species and allometric zonation more specifically we were able to explain the allometric response of trees to different subsurface properties providing new insights into the mechanisms governing plant soil feedback most importantly the influence of subsurface properties on subsurface resource distribution is explained by the model without the explicit use of competition models within the introduced manga model no belowground competition concept such as fon berger and hildenbrandt 2000 has been imposed still competition for belowground resources emerges and the model predicts an asymmetric competition behavior as such the presented approach does not depend on additional empirical parameters that would be required to describe competition with the currently available models our approach thus provides a more robust approach to simulate mangrove communities in other models the dominance in asymmetric competition for water teh et al 2015 berger and hildenbrandt 2000 depends on tree and root size with a systematic analysis of our approach using stylized setups we could firstly show that allometric properties of the trees are governed by subsurface properties single tree model furthermore unlike other models available in the literature the groundwater salinity distribution in our model depends on the geometrical arrangement of the two individual trees and we could show how the resource distribution between competing trees also depends on the tree position two tree model our tool is therefore helpful to develop a better understanding of the processes defining belowground competition for resources and aid to design more robust belowground competition concepts the manga model provides indication of the importance of the plant soil feedbacks on the appearance of mangrove stand zonation future works may want to focus on the development of a novel competition concept as a surrogate approach to the current methods such as fon as a continuation to this study the model will be used to further investigate the nature of species and allometry zonation in mangrove ecosystems due to the modular design of manga other environmental drivers such as tidal activity or precipitation can be incorporated to the groundwater model easily in order to obtain realistic stand patterns even more after considering one species allometry zonation in dependency of environmental factors the interface to the bettina model also allows to extend model setups for more mangrove species we are confident that our approach goes so far that it lays the basis for a wholly new concept of plant soil interaction models that can be adjusted flexibly to individual requirements also in non mangrove environments with different driving components than salinity 6 conflict of interest none declared acknowledgements this study was financed by the german research foundation dfg as a part of the marzipan project project number

24892,it is commonly accepted that the processes determining how plant groundwater interactions influence vegetation patterns depend on subsurface properties including groundwater availability but not much is known about the underlying processes we present a hybrid process based simulation system to study the feedback between vegetation and subsurface hydrodynamics using mangroves as an example our approach relies on first principles rather than on empirical competition concepts we develop a modular tool which dynamically couples an agent based vegetation model to a continuum groundwater model the vegetation model describes individual trees and their interactions within their environment and communities we show the dependence of the salinity distribution on aquifer properties within stylized case studies moreover the model predicts varying tree allometries depending on variations of subsurface properties finally we analyze the nature of belowground competition for fresh water as a direct consequence of the plant soil feedback that is inherent to the modelling approach the results show that the interaction of vegetation and subsurface hydrodynamics is crucial for vegetation zonation patterning in form of a pronounced distribution of tree allometry we also discuss the benefits and disadvantages of our presented plant soil feedback modelling approach as well as its implications for future research keywords mangroves groundwater vegetation subsurface coupling mechanistic plant soil feedback belowground competition 1 introduction 1 1 motivation understanding the feedback mechanisms between vegetation structure and soil properties is a perennial favorite in ecology since it is key to understand plant systems functioning many studies have shown that the spatial heterogeneity of resources in the soil such as nutrients or water controls competitive or facilitative interactions between plants additionally it influences both community structure and zonation patterns which robertson et al 1993 expressed in gradual changes of species composition or allometry it is reasonable to assume that plant soil interactions are significant in various environmental settings however they are particularly pronounced under conditions where a shortage of belowground resources controls observable vegetation patterns as in semiarid habitats peat bogs or coastal zones see fowler 1986 thiery et al 1995 berger et al 2008a b rietkerk and van de koppel 2008 getzin et al 2016 and references within for example empirical studies on plant soil interactions zonation and spatial self organization in real plant systems are still limited despite the abundant theoretical literature on this topic there is at least one exception to this in mangrove forests examples of pattern formations have been documented over many decades and it has been shown that regular patterns in this ecosystem are a frequent phenomenon rather than a peculiarity see lugo 1980 santos et al 1997 dahdouh guebas et al 2004 piou et al 2006 cohen et al 2018 ellison 2000 and examples presented in the two reviews of ellison 2000 and kathiresan and bingham 2001 the reason behind this exception in mangrove forests is a combination of factors i mangroves occur in sub tropical intertidal zones often exposed to pronounced gradients in salinity due to the inundation regime ii mangrove trees are physiologically adapted to inundation and can occur in a wide range of the salinities 5 to 90 ball 1996 mediated by changes in their hydraulic architecture minimizing the risk of embolism under water stress conditions lovelock et al 2006 and the extension of roots into more favorable soil water resources greaver and sternberg 2006 to name a few the strongest zonation pattern however either in species distribution or in tree allometry and architecture observable in monospecific stands emerges on steeper gradients cf fig 1 i or on the extreme ends of salinity or flooding gradients ball 1998 suggesting that abiotic factors are likely to be the most important drivers underlying factors and mechanism of zonation suggested are geomorphology semeniuk 1983 thom 1967 inundation classes watson 1928 physiological responses to gradients propagule sorting rabinowitz 1978 seed predation smith 1987 and succession processes after disturbances such as hurricanes piou et al 2006 imai et al 2006 all of which often superimpose such that their particular impact is hard to be separated from each other since the site conditions geomorphology hydrological boundary conditions and inundation frequency and amplitude have a strong impact on the spatial distribution of porewater salinity distribution fig 1i smith 1992 suggested these salinity gradients are the principal link between subsurface hydrology and mangrove zonation patterns on the single plant and plant community scale it is known that the plants water use reduces with increasing salt stress yan and guizhu 2007 patel et al 2010 concurrently the transpiration of the plants affects porewater salinities fig 1ii consequently the plant soil feedback between porewater salinity and mangrove water uptake represents an important interface between abiotic site conditions and plant growth patterns the emergence of species specific or allometric zonation patterns can only be reliably modeled when the coupled ecosystem and these interactions are described with a mechanistically coupled hydrodynamic groundwater mangrove stand model using such a model vegetation zonation patterns and their disturbances should even be attributable to subsurface heterogeneity fig 1 within this work we introduce the manga model that follows a concept based on first principles we verify the applicability of the model on a number of stylized setups showing the feasibility and benefits to use the mechanistical approach which inherently supports belowground competition for water without the necessity of any additional phenomenological description of competition effects as all existing models do we also discuss the suitability of our approach to investigate the plant porewater salinity feedbacks in mangrove forests due to the chosen mechanistic modelling approach and the fact that salinity stress has similar physiological effects on plant growth as drought stress we are convinced that our model cannot only provide a versatile tool to support mangrove restoration and recovery projects in future but stimulate further studies focusing on plant groundwater feedbacks in other vegetation systems 1 2 theoretical background plant soil feedbacks in mangroves have been identified as important factors for ecosystem stability against environmental drivers like sea level rise kumara et al 2010 huxham et al 2010 recently various studies aimed to advance insights about the underlying mechanisms governing those feedbacks lovelock et al 2015 mckee et al 2007 more specifically a better understanding of the role of mangrove water uptake in the porewater salinity distribution and the resulting feedback on mangrove forest zonation has been gained hereby considerable effort has been focused on the dependence of forest species composition and tree allometry distribution on groundwater salinity various authors measure an influence of porewater salinity gradients on species distribution joshi et al 2003 piou et al 2006 teh et al 2015 considered the influence of species specific water uptake rates on resulting porewater salinity and the possibilities of regime shifts from one species dominating the forest composition to another species taking this role peters et al 2014 were able to show salinity dependence of tree allometry by introducing a mechanistic model for tree water uptake and tree growth behavior those results are supported by empirical findings naidoo 2006 mitra et al 2011 other studies focus on the implications of mangrove ecosystem characteristics on surface hydrology mazda et al 2005 moreover transport and dispersion of chemical and biological material and its consequences for biomass and energy in the food web have been studied using a coupled model mazda and wolanski 2009 however mazda and wolanski 2009 do not explicitly model individual tree growth which is necessary to study the implications of subsurface and surface hydrology on individual mangrove growth to our knowledge a full mechanistic coupling approach between agent based mangrove stand models and porewater salinity dynamics is still missing in literature at this time although some studies have already introduced a feedback of individual plant water uptake and growth to groundwater dynamics jiang et al 2012 sternberg et al 2007 teh et al 2015 here we apply agent based modelling approaches and incorporate first principles to describe the model dynamics use of first principles in agent based modelling increases model flexibility facilitates predictions under new ecological conditions and allows insights to be gained regarding the interplay of driving forces in an ecological system grimm and berger 2016 the aim of our new model is to increase the understanding of the mechanistic interplay and the emerging feedback dynamics of porewater salinity and mangrove vegetation zonation patterning one possible outcome of this approach is the emergence of tree tree interactions such as competition for resources from first principles rather than imposing those interactions implicitly in this study we subdivide the feedback in two components in the first component the hydrological salinity dynamics in the porewater is described and vegetation dynamics are grouped in the second component in hydrology subsurface water in permanently saturated pore space is called groundwater i e there are only solid and liquid phases but without the presence of air within this study we assume saturated conditions up to the soil surface consequently the term groundwater is used synonymously for subsurface water finite element methods are widely applied in groundwater flow process modelling after their first introduction into this research field in the 1980s narasimhan and witherspoon 1982 numerous sophisticated and well tested groundwater modelling software packages are available including modflow harbaugh 2005 or modflow based systems 1 1 https www

opengeosys ogs www opengeosys org kolditz et al 2012 and hydrogeosphere brunner and simmons 2012 we use ogs an intensively tested and broadly applied numerical simulation tool for coupled thermo hydro mechanical chemical processes in porous and fractured media to model the abiotic hydrological dynamics of porewater salinity in the past this tool has been successfully applied in studies dealing with water resource management kalbacher et al 2012 and for coupling with various additional simulation tools kalbacher et al 2010 he et al 2015 jing et al 2018 additionally ogs has been used to investigate saltwater dynamics in coastal aquifers walther et al 2012 2014 most mangrove models do not quantify single plant water uptake although their variety is extensive to our knowledge only a few attempts exist to connect groundwater and vegetation models the manham model sternberg et al 2007 jiang et al 2012 is one of those attempts and distinguishes between mangrove and freshwater hammock vegetation it takes into account the water balance at a vegetation patch by estimating precipitation evaporation and transpiration the individual tree dynamics within the manham model incorporate the approaches of the kiwi model berger and hildenbrandt 2000 teh et al 2015 combined the vegetation approach of the manham model and the sutra hydrodynamic groundwater flow model in their mantra model mantra allowed for a more realistic description of the subsurface processes and prediction of salinity distributions in a vegetation patch both models account for freshwater intrusion in the vadose zone and the resulting change in porewater salinity distribution additionally mixing of vadose zone porewater and seawater by means of tidal dynamics is studied these models also consider plant transpiration dependence on porewater salinity competition for resources between neighboring trees in mangrove forests are typically treated via the field of neighborhood concept fon as introduced in berger and hildenbrandt 2000 depending on its size the plant is characterized by a rotationally symmetric field describing the strength of resource demand overlapping fields restrict the resource availability of competing plants among the models available in literature only the single tree model bettina peters et al 2014 accounts for dependence of individual tree allometry on groundwater salinity moreover in order to mechanistically describe the water fluxes within plants peters et al 2014 introduce the concept of plant water potential for quantifying tree water uptake the osmotic potential of the porewater controls the water uptake and thus the water extraction from the subsurface bettina is an agent based mangrove model providing an intrinsic interface to a hydrodynamic groundwater model further the bettina model mechanistically describes the allometric plasticity depending on the porewater salinity distribution peters et al 2018 employed the model to show the impact of the allometric plasticity on the self thinning characteristics at varying porewater salinity distributions these features of bettina appear to be essential for i providing a plant feedback on the subsurface water balance and ii describing the tree allometry and modeling intra specific zonation patterns 2 the manga model the process based manga model 3 3 https github com

processes from hydro geological modelling opengeosys www opengeosys org and ii the mangrove stand dynamics using an agent based tree model bettina peters et al 2014 in the following section we first introduce our coupling strategy and the two submodels then the specific model coupling scheme is explained 2 1 model coupling and model documentation the implementation of the mechanistically coupled simulation tool manga including the feedback between two very distinct types of systems requires a flexible coupling framework to facilitate model development we use already existing models by implementing them as submodules to our software package modular approaches for simulation toolboxes are widely used in hydrogeological modelling e g fischer et al 2015 horgue et al 2014 foglia et al 2018 this approach allows developers to take advantage of performed work on model verification within each submodule modular code structures also provide frameworks and allow future applications through exchange or extension of individual modules sustainable model development has been proven crucial in the context of model reusability ram 2013 in the past ongoing effort on introducing standard protocols for model documentation was taken model reproducibility is one of the key motivations for acceptable model documentation for agent based population models the odd standard protocol is widely accepted and has been improved over more than a decade grimm et al 2006 2010 2017 grimm and railsback 2012 additionally transparent source code development facilitates model reproduction application and modification within the community as a consequence usage of version control software tools in scientific modelling is increasing a widely applied tool is the distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development and coordination in collaborative software development git blischak et al 2016 ram 2013 the aspects listed above and regarded during manga model development align with the recommendations given in belete et al 2017 the manga model is outlined in the following section a full documentation following the odd standard is provided in the supplementary material all source code is version controlled and available to the community as an open source git version controlled project 3 2 2 modelling approaches of the individual models 2 2 1 porewater salinity dynamics ogs to explain the relationship between vegetation patterns and three dimensional hydrodynamic processes we have to consider temporal scales of decades up to at least some 100 years and spatial dimensions of hectares porewater salinity distributions in turn can vary on timescales of hours to days to keep the computational costs manageable we consider saturated flow i e the sediment pores only contain water and no air the limitations of this assumption in mangroves is discussed later following diersch and kolditz 2002 the porewater salinity dynamics are described by a system of partial differential equations starting from mass and momentum conservation within the system phenomenological laws of fickian type dispersive mass flux the bear scheidegger dispersion relationship and newton s viscosity law are used additionally porewater density is regarded as a function of pressure and porewater salinity only moreover the porewater is taken as incompressible with constant dynamic viscosity the interfacial drag term of momentum exchange is approximated up to second order in bulk flow velocity within the momentum balance inertia is neglected and forces are accounted for up to linear order in bulk velocity the resulting total porewater mass flow in a three dimensional aquifer domain ω reads 1 ϕ ρ r p p t ϕ ρ r s s t κ μ ρ r p

access 27 12 2019 2 2 2 mangrove model bettina the general interplay of allometric tree measures physiological parameters and resource limitation within bettina is given in the supplementary material water dynamics within single trees in bettina are modeled as follows the water uptake q is calculated starting from darcy s law for laminar flow of water volume 5 q δ ψ r with potential difference δψ and flow resistance along the flow path r here δψ is the difference between the leaf water potential and the sum of height potential of the leaf and osmotic potential of the porewater hence environmental factors tree allometry and species specific parameters are considered bettina does not explicitly model salt absorption and exclusion mechanisms thus there is no species specific consideration this implies the assumption of negligible effect of those mechanisms on considered temporal and spatial scales so far bettina parametrization is based on avicennia germinans the resistance r in turn is a function which depends on tree geometry such as stem height stem radius root zone and crown geometry as well as on species specific parameters such as xylem conductivity and fine root permeability resources are distributed through a specified ratio hence the available resources for the tree are attributed to a limiting resource either water uptake q or the available light bettina does not account for the influence of nutrient availability the available resources are used for maintenance of the living biomass proportional to the trees volume and growth within tree growth resources available for growth are allocated in order to optimize resource uptake by facilitating uptake of the limiting kind of resource for more detailed explanations see peters et al 2014 and peters et al 2018 and the supplementary material in order to model tree populations we combine several trees which are described by the bettina model the interaction of trees within our approach can only manifest itself in competition for resources shadowing effects between different individuals are taken into account we do not explicitly introduce a competition scheme for water uptake since trees indirectly compete by local change of environmental conditions porewater salinity in the vicinity of their roots which is modeled in detail by the coupling to ogs 2 3 implementation of the model coupling mangrove stand and porewater salinity dynamics have distinct temporal scales groundwater dynamics on the spatial scales of several hectares take place on timescales from seconds to hours vegetation dynamics is typically modeled with time steps varying from months to years in our approach the latter defines the frequency of transfer of information between the two distinct models ogs often requires finer time stepping than bettina between bettina timesteps all information about the mangrove population i e the boundary conditions within the ogs setup stays constant while ogs is calculating the change in porewater salinity distribution bettina then uses the calculated information on porewater salinity distribution to update the mangrove population in its next time step the implemented coupling cycle for system dynamics after setup initialization reads 1 bettina evolves and updates every tree fig 2 i 2 information on plant distribution and individual specific allometric measures is saved in distinct boundary grids which are passed to ogs hereby eq 5 is applied to dynamically update the neumann type boundary conditions for bulk flow velocity eq 3 defined at the tree root meshes abiotic external drivers can also be included using boundary grids fig 2ii 3 ogs calculates the development of porewater salinity within the setup under consideration of all biotic and abiotic external drivers fig 2iii 4 states of porewater salinity distribution within the aquifer are saved at dynamical adapting frequencies which orient on the change rate of porewater salinity distribution fig 2iv 3 model application we study the mechanism connecting mangrove water uptake and porewater salinity distribution in stylized scenario setups subsequently we investigate the effect on resource acquisition of tree communities emerging from the implemented plant soil feedback a simple vegetation setup consists of one tree located at a point r on the surface of a three dimensional aquifer domain ω environmental factors like tidal activity and precipitation are not considered since we focus on the implications of plant water use additionally the aquifer domain ω is defined to be homogeneous with respect to the aquifers permeability κ introducing a hydraulic gradient i x leads to a constant groundwater flow using this setup the dependence of the groundwater salinity distribution and tree model dynamics on the parameters i aquifer permeability and ii hydraulic gradient can be investigated by parameter variation the smallest possible setup of interacting trees consists of two individuals hence we add a second tree to the scenario described above to examine the tree tree interactions both trees are located in one streamline by variation of the distance between the two trees the strength and nature of competition for belowground resources is analyzed fig 3 the aquifer domain ω extensions x 0 l x 0 l y l z 0 is represented using a 3 dimensional grid with resolution of a characteristic length scale of 1 m in the x y plane in the vicinity of trees the grid is refined up to the characteristic length scale of 0 3 r r with r r denoting the root radius in the vertical direction five layers are considered with a four times higher resolution at the surface than at the bottom of the aquifer within this stylized case study we update the tree population monthly i e information between the two submodels is exchanged every month the initial distributions for pressure p i and salinity s i are set as 6 s i x s x y z t 0 s 0 and 7 p i x p x y z t 0 ρ g z where g is the gravitational constant for both scenarios no flow boundary conditions for both variables pressure and salinity are imposed along the y and z axis a constant horizontal hydraulic gradient i x induces background bulk flow pressure boundary conditions g p for the left uppercase l and right uppercase r boundaries are given as 8 g d l p p i x 0 y z 9 g n r p κ μ ρ r 2 g i x with constant dynamic viscosity μ and homogeneous permeability tensor κ salinity boundary conditions g s read 10 g d l s s 0 11 g d r s s 0 the boundary conditions describing tree fresh water uptake at the root uppercase t read 12 g n t p ρ r δ ψ r this boundary condition represents the extraction of fresh water from the saline water body as described in peters et al 2018 in our setup the boundary conditions g d l s g d r s g d l p and g n r p fully define the environmental conditions for the groundwater dynamics g d l p defines the pressure on the left boundary of the setup domain representing a constant pressure head on the landward boundary of a saturated groundwater body g n r p denotes the bulk flow out of the domain over its right boundary this boundary condition is applied in order to impose groundwater flow velocities resulting from the gravitational force the salinity values on those two boundaries are set as constant using g d l s and g d r s representing the inflow of water with a certain salinity and the outflow to a similar water body e g the outflow of water into the open sea in general one can incorporate other environmental factors such as tidal activity and precipitation by defining additional boundary conditions representing those phenomena for the sake of simplicity and conceptual analysis our setup only incorporates the background flow as described above values for ogs parameterization i e the parameters defining groundwater flow used to generate the following example simulations are given in table 1 and are inspired using the results of schwendenmann and riecke 2006 and tait et al 2016 in this stylized model application we choose an aquifer depth of 1 5 m in order to represent a shallow mangrove aquifer as observed in schwendenmann and riecke 2006 values for molecular diffusion dynamic viscosity and reference density are aligned with standard values for distilled water at room temperature we simplify the groundwater dynamics by assuming salinity independent groundwater density values for the permeability and the hydraulic gradient vary within the range of measurement results presented in schwendenmann and riecke 2006 we designed the horizontal extent of our setup in a way that boundary effects on the trees are minimized the order of magnitude for transverse and longitudinal dispersion coefficients is given by numerical restrictions and are adapted from pool and carrera 2011 model parameters for the tree modeled by bettina are given in the supplementary material and taken from the original bettina single tree model parametrization peters et al 2014 for a germinans 3 1 single tree scenario at simulation start a tree sapling is planted at the domain surface with five meters distance to the inflow and the lateral boundaries and 15 m distance to the outflow boundary fig 3 in order to investigate the influence of aquifer permeability values and the hydraulic gradient n 30 numerical experiments have been performed varying those parameters after 50 years simulation time the salinity along the flow direction at 15 cm depth is observed a characteristic shape for the salinity distribution within the aquifer as shown in fig 4 i is observed for all parameters tested directly in the root zone the salinity increases along flow direction downstream to the tree an effect of increased salinity in the porewater occurs until the effect of the dirichlet boundary condition dominates the measurements at the outflow boundary increase of salinity within the root region is observed for all used parameter setups after 50 years simulation time as shown in fig 4ii iii the root zone is defined by the intersection of the aquifer domain ω and cylinder around the tree center with radius r s r r with r r denoting the trees root radius lower mean salinities within the root zone are observed with the increase of both aquifer permeability and hydraulic gradient fig 4ii hereby within the range of parameters tested a five times larger permeability leads to a decrease of salinity by roughly 25 additionally a threefold increased hydraulic gradient reduces the root zone salinity by approximately 10 an increase of initial salinity s 0 leads to an increase in root zone salinity fig 4iii trees in a setup with s 0 95 do not persist for 50 years in fig 4iv the result for tree height measurements are presented as shown increasing permeabilities or increasing hydraulic gradients lead to an increase in total tree height after 50 years simulation time the measure is sensitive to both parameters tested increase of hydraulic gradients leads to an increase in reached total tree height similarly the correlation between total tree height and permeability is positive comparison of the crown area with root area shows an allometric response of the tree growth to varying subsurface properties fig 4v vi with lower permeability as well as low hydraulic gradients the tree allocates more resources into root growth than into crown growth leading to a decreasing fraction between the respective areas higher initial salinities lead to more resource allocation in root growth resulting in a lower crown to root area fraction 3 2 two tree scenario as second application a second tree is added to the setup described above the tree located upstream is called first tree in the following the other tree is called second tree the second tree is located downstream to the first with varying distance d fig 5 i the groundwater flow domain is extended by d in the flow direction such that the distance between the absorbing dirichlet boundary and the second tree stays constant n 40 numerical experiments have been performed with distances varying from 0 25 to 10 m the values for aquifer permeability κ 2 5 1 10 11 m2 hydraulic gradient i x 1 2 10 3 and simulation time t 50 years are kept constant an example for resulting salinity distributions measured after 50 years simulation time in 15 cm depth on the transect plane is shown in fig 5i a characteristic shape has been observed for all tested values of d showing the resulting shape as the combination of the individual salinity distributions induced by each individual tree fig 5ii shows the mean salinity within the root zone defined above vs the reference value obtained from the corresponding results of the one tree setup for both trees the mean salinity is increased a range of approximately 4 m can be observed for the first tree until the effect of salinity increase by the presence on the second tree is negligible a small jump in the root zone salinities for both trees can be observed at the same distance mean salinity within the root zone of the second tree is increased for all tested values of d relative to the reference tree with the maximum of root zone salinization at approximately 4 m distance between the tree centers the reduction in total reached tree height is shown in fig 5ii a reduction of tree growth for the first tree can be observed within the range of 4 m the effect of tree growth reduction is decreasing with increasing distance between the trees from a reached height of 83 of the reference measure at distance d 0 25 m to a vanishing effect e g same total tree height as measured in the reference setup decrease of tree growth varying from 77 to 88 of the reference value for the second tree is observed within the results of all performed numerical experiments this effect is decreasing with increasing distance between the trees the measured crown to root ratio of both trees is divided by the reference ratio in fig 5iv for both trees a reduction of this allometric measure is observed a value below one indicates increased resource allocation to root growth relative to the reference tree for the first tree the same range of effect of tree distances up to 4 m can be observed the minimum value for the allometric measure of the first tree is 75 increased allocation of resources to root growth is observed for all tested values of d for the second tree here the minimum of the fraction of 68 is measured at d 1 m 4 discusssion to the best of our knowledge the manga model is the first simulation model which describes plant groundwater feedbacks according to first principles and is thus explicitly mechanistic the model is a hybrid linking an agent based vegetation model bettina with a continuous groundwater model ogs the model was firstly applied to mangroves because this ecosystem is characterized by pronounced zonation patterns in both species distributions and patterns in the allometry of one particular species which provides extraordinary possibilities to evaluate the suitability of the model to capture the underlying mechanisms correctly allometric patterns were addressed by the simulation experiments performed the single tree setup showed an influence of subsurface properties on groundwater salinity distributions and tree growth behavior results obtained using the two tree model system provide insights into the mechanisms governing belowground competition for resources in mangroves based on first principles following emerging effects of soil parameters on the modelled plant soil feedback have been shown within the single tree setup aquifers with low soil permeabilities result in higher mean salinities in the root zones with increasing soil permeabilities higher groundwater flow velocities occur and therefore the salt accumulated at tree roots is carried away more easily hence the established equilibrium salt concentration decreases with higher values of subsurface permeability the same mechanism explains reduced mean salinity values within the root zone for higher hydraulic gradients with increasing permeability and increasing hydraulic gradients equally parameterized trees become taller within the same amount of time the tree growth is reduced by increasing groundwater salinity which is a result of soil parameter dependent equilibrium groundwater salinities an effect of subsurface properties on the emerging allometry of our model trees has been shown the reduced ratio of crown area to root area with reduced groundwater flow velocities low hydraulic gradients and or low permeability values and therefore higher salinities within the root zones of the trees can be understood by analyzing the growth behavior of the bettina model in situations where the porewater salinity is high a tree within the bettina model allocates resources such that porewater is more accessible e g a larger root area facilitates water uptake this observation is also in line with the original description of the solitaire bettina model peters et al 2014 within the model framework qualitative agreement with the observed relations between the growth behavior of trees and initial salinities i e different mangrove systems like delta systems or tropical dry regions are reproduced due to the growth dynamics within the bettina model trees directly react to salinity by variation of their growth behavior hence trees allocate more resources in root growth within saline than in brackish conditions the model presented here shows effects of the positioning of a tree within its environment by analyzing the emerging interaction of two trees resulting porewater salinity distributions within a two tree setup emerge partly from the superposition of their individually induced effects on water uptake in the presented groundwater salinity distribution along a transect line at 15 cm depth fig 5i two maxima can be observed each of those maxima represents the peak of the groundwater salinity distribution induced by individual trees in this numerical experiment the water uptake of the second tree and therefore the increase in groundwater salinity is lower due to the higher background salinity within its root zone induced by the first tree the increase of salinity within the root zone for the two trees shown in fig 5ii shows dependence of the tree positioning relative to each other for the first tree the presence of the second tree can only be measured up to a distance corresponding to approximately two times the root radius in contrast the root zone of the second tree has increased salinity for all tested distances between the trees since less saline water from the inflow boundary reaches the first tree firstly the effect of increased salinity is always lower for this tree after a threshold distance between the trees is reached the increasing effect of the second tree on porewater salinity is not affecting the region of the first tree by means of diffusion and dispersion hence the second tree s presence has no influence on the porewater salinity distribution within the first tree s root zone fig 5iii and iv some shortcomings within the model design exist due to simplifications here we explicitly discuss some of the model s assumptions listed in the main body and the appendix of this work the assumption of saturated soil conditions is important to keep computation cost for the groundwater submodel low this simplification implies that water saturation in the soil does not limit plant growth which we can assume in mangrove ecosystems in principle it would be possible to extend the current model coupling such that both sub models calculate and evaluate water saturation in the soil extensions to the groundwater model further increase model runtimes our approach to use a deterministic model to depict belowground dynamics however already leads to increased model runtimes compared to traditional belowground competition approaches e g fon thus reducing model usability furthermore we currently do not consider geochemical reactions e g redox reactions and multi component transport reaction processes e g transformation of nutrients in the presence of nutrient scarcity or important geochemical reactions however modifications for both the tree and groundwater model are possible see e g he et al 2015 due to the modularity of our coupling approach it is even possible to exchange the tree or groundwater model for an approach that is capable to meet aforementioned potential requirements i e variable saturated soil or geochemical reactions the current setups also do not account for any dilution effect at the ground surface e g precipitation or tidal dynamics and the role of crab burrows for water infiltration the incorporation of precipitation and tidal dynamics is neglected here in order to be able to directly analyze the feedback model although those drivers also influence the manifestation of the analyzed plant soil feedback for preliminary investigations on how changes in tidal amplitude and incursion into the mangrove forest affect the plant soil feedback time dependent boundary conditions 5 5 https www opengeosys org docs benchmarks python bc hertz contact hertz contact last access 20 12 2019 can be included in the groundwater model furthermore our model could be extended by incorporating models available in the literature as provided by mazda and wolanski 2009 taking advantage of our modular approach mazda and ikeda 2006 proposed how crab burrows affect soil permeabilities using their results the influence of crab burrows can be explicitly modelled with inhomogeneous soil permeability distributions within our approach in future investigations using first principles less assumptions drawn from empiric measurements are used eventually resulting in more reliable model results we can use more mechanistic relations and rely less on empirical based but phenomenological assumptions still model parametrization remains challenging the emerging interaction between the trees and the porewater dynamics provides insights into the mechanisms driving the plant soil feedback based on first principles grimm and berger 2016 only plant water uptake and the associated salinity increase was imposed the emerging interaction of trees can be interpreted as outcome of competition for water which is usually modelled implicitly berger and hildenbrandt 2000 we were able to show that competition for resources fresh water in this case is a direct consequence of the mechanism described by the model for this reason we are convinced that the developed hybrid modelling approach is an important step forward towards the description of plant water feedbacks beyond the chosen mangrove system 5 conclusions this work presents the coupling of an agent based mechanistic tree model to a complex groundwater flow and transport model so far recent approaches to model the plant groundwater salinity feedback in mangrove ecosystems have used plant models which did not consider varying tree allometry jiang et al 2012 sternberg et al 2007 teh et al 2015 the semi mechanistic approach by peters et al 2014 was able to explain varying tree allometry but it did not account for dynamic environmental conditions as a result of tree water uptake or explain plant soil feedbacks by using an approach based on first principles we were able to address these shortcomings the introduced model delivers a novel approach to study the characteristics of different types of mangrove zonation patterns e g species and allometric zonation more specifically we were able to explain the allometric response of trees to different subsurface properties providing new insights into the mechanisms governing plant soil feedback most importantly the influence of subsurface properties on subsurface resource distribution is explained by the model without the explicit use of competition models within the introduced manga model no belowground competition concept such as fon berger and hildenbrandt 2000 has been imposed still competition for belowground resources emerges and the model predicts an asymmetric competition behavior as such the presented approach does not depend on additional empirical parameters that would be required to describe competition with the currently available models our approach thus provides a more robust approach to simulate mangrove communities in other models the dominance in asymmetric competition for water teh et al 2015 berger and hildenbrandt 2000 depends on tree and root size with a systematic analysis of our approach using stylized setups we could firstly show that allometric properties of the trees are governed by subsurface properties single tree model furthermore unlike other models available in the literature the groundwater salinity distribution in our model depends on the geometrical arrangement of the two individual trees and we could show how the resource distribution between competing trees also depends on the tree position two tree model our tool is therefore helpful to develop a better understanding of the processes defining belowground competition for resources and aid to design more robust belowground competition concepts the manga model provides indication of the importance of the plant soil feedbacks on the appearance of mangrove stand zonation future works may want to focus on the development of a novel competition concept as a surrogate approach to the current methods such as fon as a continuation to this study the model will be used to further investigate the nature of species and allometry zonation in mangrove ecosystems due to the modular design of manga other environmental drivers such as tidal activity or precipitation can be incorporated to the groundwater model easily in order to obtain realistic stand patterns even more after considering one species allometry zonation in dependency of environmental factors the interface to the bettina model also allows to extend model setups for more mangrove species we are confident that our approach goes so far that it lays the basis for a wholly new concept of plant soil interaction models that can be adjusted flexibly to individual requirements also in non mangrove environments with different

24893,adult survival has long been believed to be the most important demographic parameter in long lived species such as large raptors with productivity being of secondary importance our studies of the steller s sea eagle haliaeetus pelagicus populations on the north east of sakhalin island and in the amur region russian far east in 2004 2017 have revealed highly unstable productivity that averages 0 53 and 0 61 fledglings per occupied territory per year respectively which is fairly low in comparison to previous decades about 1 fledgling per occupied territory per year the productivity varied between years within a 2 7 fold span being relatively low most of the time on sakhalin island the most serious hazard influencing eagle productivity is nestling predation by brown bears among other negative factors are adverse weather and food conditions habitat alteration disturbance at nest sites and on the mainland the hydrological regime of the amur river to assess the sustainability of both populations we have developed two matrix population models of the lefkovitch type the models predict a decline of both island and mainland populations these being halved in 115 and 72 years respectively apart from the main scenario 1 we considered two additional scenarios to stabilize the populations 2 cessation of bear predation and 3 enabling population regulation by involvement of floaters non territorial adults into the reproduction on sakhalin island increasing the fecundity under scenarios 2 and 3 could theoretically stabilize the population on the mainland the stabilization cannot be realized under either scenario stochastic modelling supports the main conclusion of population decline but generally its predictions are more optimistic some scenarios leading to different conclusions therefore though admitting the secondary importance of fecundity in large raptors as compared to adult survival we suggest that the fecundity can vary in broader limits and if at a poor level can alone lead to population decline on the other hand this parameter is more amenable to management so that efforts should be focused on raising it to higher levels stochasticity can have major effects on the population dynamics and should be accounted for in models keywords steller s sea eagle haliaeetus pelagicus matrix population model breeding performance bear predation russian far east 1 introduction animal populations are systems whose dynamics depend on changes in birth and mortality rates immigration and emigration neal 2004 in the case of species characterised by philopatry and site fidelity the exchange of individuals between populations is relatively low so the population trajectory is ultimately shaped by changes in birth and death rates krüger and lindström 2001 therefore population growth can be achieved by increase in productivity or survival since environmental resources are limited it is impossible to fully implement both strategies and there is always a trade off between investment in reproduction and investment in the maintenance of vital functions and ultimately in the survivorship recent advances in demography and population modelling showed that in long lived species population growth is usually most dependent on adult survival heppell et al 2000 saether and bakke 2000 maestri et al 2017 for such species the most important demographic parameter is individual survival especially of adults the reproduction rates being of lesser importance e g grier 1980 for example on sakhalin island each year a significant fraction of territorial steller s sea eagles 30 60 skip breeding masterov et al 2018 because it can be more expedient for the eagles to abandon breeding in seasons with unfavourable conditions in order to preserve themselves for future nesting attempts when conditions improve our long term monitoring study of two populations of the steller s sea eagle haliaeetus pelagicus in two of the main regions of its range on sakhalin island and in the amur region russian far east revealed a significant decline in eagle productivity during recent decades in sakhalin the productivity has decreased from 0 8 to 1 4 fledglings per occupied territory per year in the 1980s and 1990s masterov 1995 masterov et al 2000 to 0 54 fledglings per occupied territory per year in recent years masterov et al 2018 a similar situation is observed in the amur region where the productivity has been decreasing since the 1980s and in last decade was on average 0 64 fledglings per occupied territory per annum also the productivity varied within a 3 4 fold span between years of monitoring being relatively low most of the time at the same time steller s sea eagles appear to remain an abundant species in both regions with the nesting density in favourable habitats reaching high levels the only apparent change in their populations is a reduction of the immature fraction formerly the immature to adult ratio was about 0 43 0 67 but in recent years it has been only 0 18 0 20 masterov et al 2018 which may be evidence of population decline bildstein 2001 however this parameter alone is a poor indicator of population size katzner et al 2007 it is known that population changes can occur slowly with a certain time lag and often pass unnoticed until it is too late so the question arises is it possible that the worsening of such a presumably secondary parameter as productivity does lead to population decline to address this question we have developed matrix population models for both island and mainland populations estimated their growth rates simulated stochastic dynamics and considered effects of possible increases in productivity under several alternative scenarios these are 1 development as it is the main scenario 2 productivity increase by cessation of bear predation and 3 productivity increase by involvement of non territorial adults floaters into the reproduction 2 materials and methods 2 1 study objects steller s sea eagle is a large diurnal raptor whose nesting range is situated in the russian far east the global population is unlikely to exceed 7 thousand individuals masterov et al 2018 possessing high longevity a long period of maturation and comparatively low productivity ibid the eagle is a vivid example of a k strategist macarthur and wilson 1967 pianka 1970 or a civilized ponge 2013 species along with many other large raptors doub 2013 being evolutionary adapted to stable or predictable environments these species begin to lose their competitive ability if conditions become unstable ponge 2013 the eagles diet consists substantially of seafood fig 1 and their life cycle is tightly associated with fish rich water bodies sea coast bays lakes and rivers in sakhalin the eagles nest mostly in trees their main nesting habitats being forest tracts and fragments situated not far from water bodies typical eagle nests are large conspicuous structures approximately 1 5 2 m wide made of branches and normally placed in the upper part or on the top of a tree quite often a pair of eagles builds several nests choosing one for breeding in a given year other nests can either be used for other purposes perching feeding etc or abandoned one or several nests owned by one eagle pair together with the adjacent area constitute a nesting territory hardey et al 2009 territorial pairs can hold their territories for many years however not all nesting territories are occupied in sakhalin the annual territory occupancy averages 70 masterov et al 2018 the usual clutch is 1 2 rarely 3 eggs broods of three chicks are exceptionally rare the nests normally holding broods of 1 or 2 chicks however the mature fraction of the steller s population is non uniform the core of the population is formed by pairs of territorial birds breeders which occupy nesting territories and raise chicks thereby ensuring reproduction there is also a certain number of floaters non breeding adults which for various reasons do not occupy a territory penteriani et al 2011 on the one hand the presence of this group reduces per capita productivity number of fledglings per adult individual per year but on the other floaters form a population reserve occupying vacant territories when they appear thus floaters stabilise the number of breeding territories and eventually the overall population when the supply of floaters is exhausted the breeding population may decline precipitously wilcove and terborgh 1984 the abundance of this reserve may be especially significant for large populations that have achieved carrying capacity of the environment hansen and hodges 1985 palmqvist and vizcaíno 2003 in common buzzards of southern britain floaters may comprise 75 of adults kenward et al 2000 while in populations of large raptors such as the bald eagle floater to breeder ratio may equal 0 9 1 03 hunt 1998 floaters tend to concentrate on communal roosting areas together with immature eagles whereas breeders usually hunt within their territories among many factors influencing eagle productivity the most serious hazard is chick predation by brown bears on sakhalin island masterov et al 2018 other negative factors are adverse weather and food conditions habitat changes disturbances at nest sites and on the mainland the hydrological regime of the amur river 2 2 study areas the field studies were performed in two study areas situated in the russian far east on the north eastern coast of sakhalin island in 2004 2014 and in lower reaches of the amur river in 2006 2017 on sakhalin the study area is orientated from south to north encompassing the coasts of lunsky nabil nyyskiy chaivo and piltun bays together with the lower reaches of the rivers that flow into these bays the northern and southern boundaries of the study area correspond to latitudes 53 23 57 n and 51 11 14 n respectively and the length of the area from south to north is approximately 250 km the eastern boundary coincides with the coast line the western boundary lies at approximately 20 30 km from the coast depending on local hydrological characteristics including only the space that is potentially suitable for sea eagles the study area is approximately 3280 km2 the study area in the amur region referred to as lower amur encompasses the lower reaches of the amur river together with the channels of the amur floodplain and associated large and small lakes with rivers flowing into them the largest lakes are udyl kizi kadi irkutskoe and dudinskoe the northern and southern boundaries of the study area are 139 43 17 n and 139 44 18 n the western border passes along the river pilda 139 33 14 e with the eastern border bounded by the coast of the tatar strait the total area is about 4000 km2 2 3 field methods data were collected annually from the beginning of july until the end of august the field works included two main activities 1 working with nests and territories to estimate the eagles productivity and other aspects of breeding performance and 2 counts of eagles with the purpose of determining the age and territorial structure of the populations when working on nesting grounds we sought to examine every single nest and determine its status using the terminology outlined by postupalsky 1974 and specified by steenhof and newton 2007 we grouped nests into nesting territories on the basis of territorial proximity taking into account their occupancy status the doubled radius of the area around the nest that is defended by territory owners which is approximately 400 m masterov 1992 was used as a general criterion of nest proximity we also took into account the distribution and territorial behaviour of birds the number of inspected territories depended on weather conditions and other logistical constraints for example some territories become inaccessible at certain water levels etc every year we visited 124 283 territories on sakhalin and 20 200 territories in the amur region registered their status and if breeding took place determined the number of chicks including repeated examinations 3584 visits was made during the study period in order to convert our estimates of productivity from territorial pairs to all adult individuals including floaters we performed counts of the age and territorial structure of the sakhalin and lower amur populations during 2004 2017 we made more than 7 000 observations of eagles we aimed to avoid repeated counts within the same year but obviously the same individuals could be repeatedly met in different years adult immature and juvenile birds are well distinguished by their age specific plumage masterov et al 2018 the territoriality status of adults was initially identified in the field by expert judgment based on the birds behaviour e g territorial defensive courtship location relative to nesting areas and other circumstances of the observation habitat number of birds etc subsequently these estimates were revised on mapped data and the final judgment was made in doubtful cases adult birds registered farther than 1 5 km from the nearest sea eagle nest were classified as floaters the threshold being based on our observations and energetic constraints of the species masterov 1992 2 4 matrix model as a tool to describe the population dynamics of the steller s sea eagle we construct a birth pulse post breeding census stage structured matrix model 1 n t 1 a n t where t is discrete time n t is a vector representing the population stage structure and a is the so called lefkovitch projection matrix caswell 2001 logofet and klochkova 2002 the projection matrix possesses a number of features that can be interpreted in biological terms being therefore a valuable tool to model population dynamics in particular we calculate the dominant eigenvalue λ1 of a subscript 1 will be further omitted which represents the asymptotic population growth rate the corresponding left and right eigenvectors w and v which represent the stable stage structure and the reproductive value respectively in addition the elasticities of λ with regard to the elements of the projection matrix are calculated to estimate the relative importance of different vital rates for the population growth commonly in matrix models of sexually reproducing species reproduction is expressed in terms of female offspring per female caswell 2001 however there is no superfluous sex in monogamous raptors the presence of both pair members throughout nesting being virtually essential to brood survival hunt 1998 this is true for the steller s sea eagle which is characterised by equal sex ratio and monogamy masterov et al 2018 this allows us to ignore sex differences and calculate all the parameters including reproduction rates per adult individual the time step of the model is one year following our previous models romanov and masterov 2008 2014 we identify 7 age classes fig 2 juveniles juv represented by grown fledglings ready to leave their nests five classes of immature birds im1 im2 im3 im4 im5 represented by young birds in the age of 1 5 years and a single class of adults ad aged to 6 or more years 2 5 parameters and their estimation 2 5 1 productivity and fecundity in our field studies the eagles productivity was measured directly as the number of fledglings per occupied territory per territorial pair this vital rate is included in the model as fecundity i e productivity per adult individual since not all adults are breeders converting productivity to fecundity requires taking the territorial structure of the population into account if there were no floaters we could calculate fecundity simply by dividing productivity by two an additional correction is multiplying the obtained value by the proportion of breeders which we know from bird counts see section 2 3 2 5 2 adult and immature survival lacking the direct estimates of age specific mortalities we applied several different approaches to assess them indirectly first we used published data on survival within the captive steller s population in more than 90 zoos and nurseries across the world kurilovich 2016 to estimate survival probability after the first year of life we analysed the life histories of 367 individuals aged 1 years including 45 death events and obtained a survival curve then fitted an ageing model and applied corrections for the survival difference between captive and wild populations we chose the weibull ageing model 2 m x m 0 α x β where x is the age mx is the mortality at age x m 0 is the extrinsic occasional mortality α and β are coefficients determining the rate of ageing β determines the shape of the curve and α determines its scale because mortality can be split into two components extrinsic i e occasional m 0 and intrinsic related to ageing αxβ this allows us to correct extrinsic mortality for the difference between captive and wild populations as proposed by ricklefs 2000 the survival curve in the weibull model follows the equation 3 l x e x p m 0 x α x β 1 β 1 where lx is the proportion of the population surviving to age x other terms retain their values we fit this model using the weighted nls non linear least squares the weighting variable was the number of individuals under hazard since values of lx are not independent the goodness of fit statistics were obtained by randomization manly 2006 as recommended by ricklefs and scheuerlein 2002 once the model is fitted we have estimates of all parameters for the captive population which we can transfer to the wild population by introducing certain corrections according to ricklefs 2000 the rates of ageing in birds do not differ between wild and captive populations but the extrinsic mortality does the allometric equation connecting the extrinsic mortality with the body mass is 4 lg m 0 i s l g m where i is the intercept s is the regression slope and m is body mass g ricklefs showed that s is same in captive and wild populations and equals 0 43 but the intercept is different being 0 17 in captive and 0 17 in wild populations based on this equation we obtain the extrinsic mortality for the same species same body mass in the wild m 0 wild correcting lg m 0 in captivity by the difference between the intercepts i e 0 34 5 lg m 0 w i l d lg m 0 0 34 knowing m 0 α and β we can now calculate mortality and therefore survival for each particular age class this model can be further simplified for the adult age class since the adult fecundity is assumed to not depend on the bird s age the age distribution is unimportant this allows us to replace weibull ageing model with a negative exponential model having a single parameter adult survival probability pad for a stable population λ1 1 the total number of adults individuals of age 6 equates to the integral of the survival curve so that pad can be parameterized by the following equation 6 6 exp m 0 x α x β 1 β 1 d x 6 p a d x d x once pad is parameterized the negative exponential model produces at λ 1 the same number of adults hence the same number of offspring as weibull model so both models are equivalent in this sense the advantage of the negative exponential model is that its parameter of survival probability is constant so that we can apply it to our pooled adult class of birds 2 5 3 juvenile survival here the estimate follows our previous work romanov and masterov 2014 using the population method newton 1979 specifically it was derived from the juvenile to immature ratio since the abundances of age classes in the stable age structure are constrained to eq 1 and the eigenvalue equation a n λ n we can express the abundance of each class through those of the younger ones 7 n i m 5 n i m 4 p i m 4 λ 1 n i m 3 p i m 3 p p i m 4 λ 2 n i m 2 p i m 2 p i m 3 p i m 4 λ 3 n i m 1 p i m 1 p i m 2 p i m 3 p i m 4 λ 4 n j u v p j u v p i m 1 p i m 2 p i m 3 p i m 4 λ 5 where njuv is the number of juveniles nim 1 nim 2 nim 3 nim 5 are the numbers of immature individuals 1 5 years old respectively pjuv pim 1 pim 2 pim 3 pim 4 are the survival rates of the corresponding age classes and λ is the dominant eigenvalue a priori lambda is not known but we can calculate approximate values for a stable population assuming that λ 1 we can relate the juvenile to immature ratio to the survival rates of age classes 8 n i m m n j u v n i m 1 n i m 2 n i m 3 n i m 4 n i m 5 n j u v n j u v p j u v n j u v p j u v p i m 1 n j u v p j u v p i m 1 p i m 2 n j u v p j u v p i m 1 p i m 2 p i m 3 n j u v p

we can express pjuv through the juvenile to immature ratio and the survival rates of immature age classes which are supposedly known from the parameterization of the weibull model 9 p j u v n i m m n j u v 1 p i m 1 p i m 1 p i m 2 p i m 1 p i m 2 p i m 3 p i m 1 p i m 2 p i m 3 p i m 4 the absolute numbers of juveniles and immatures in the study area are not known a priori but their ratio can be estimated by the immature to adult ratio and fecundity which are the proportions that have a common denominator 10 r i a f n i m m n a d n j u v n a d n i m m n j u v where ria is the immature to adult ratio in counts f is the fecundity of adults therefore 11 p j u v r i a f 1 p i m 1 p i m 1 p i m 2 p i m 1 p i m 2 p i m 3 p i m 1 p i m 2 p i m 3 p i m 4 2 6 three scenarios of population development we considered three possible scenarios of further development of the island and mainland populations differing by their fecundities scenario 1 is the main scenario which simulates population development as it is without any changes in fecundity scenario 2 the no predation scenario implies an increase in fecundity due to the cessation of bear predation the corresponding hypothetical no predation fecundity is calculated as the summarized number of fledged and depredated chicks per adult individual per year scenario 3 simulates an increase in fecundity by applying the moffat s equilibrium concept in a declining population floaters may occupy vacated territories and start to breed thus increasing the per capita productivity and therefore playing the role of a population reserve this mechanism of maintaining the balance of a population with the environment was proposed by c b moffat in 1903 moffat 1903 as an alternative for density dependent reductions in fecundity and survival and it is known to be the case in populations of territorial bird species such as raptors hunt 1998 2002 hence this scenario studies the potential capability of floaters to buffer population decline and stabilize the population the maximum possible fecundity that can be reached is the no floaters fecundity which is calculated as the number of fledged chicks per territorial individual per year to model the moffat s equilibrium scenario we separate breeders and floaters allowing transitions between them the central idea behind this concept is the carrying capacity of the landscape formalized by hunt 1998 as the number of serviceable breeding locations so that we have introduced the corresponding parameter for each population the parameter is assigned a value equal to the initial number of breeders in a population of 1000 individuals calculated from the field data on population structure divided by two here we follow the assumption than the number of breeders reflects the carrying capacity of the study area at each step of simulation if the number of breeders is below the carrying capacity then we replenish it with the corresponding number of individuals from the floater group unless it is fully exhausted as a result the per capita fecundity is increasing and the rate of decline is slowing down 2 7 introducing environmental stochasticity it was shown that in changing environments the population growth rate may differ from that predicted by a deterministic model tuljapurkar et al 2003 environmental conditions in different years vary greatly in terms of food abundance weather bear predation pressure and other factors that eventually result in different vital rates especially productivity masterov et al 2018 in order to simulate this stochasticity we use the sets of annual projection matrices based on the data of particular breeding seasons from those annual matrices we construct random sequences by the independent and identically distributed iid choice at each step caswell 2001 to project the population structure for 100 years we have simulated 104 sequences for each population stochastic growth rates are calculated 1 from constructing a very long random sequence 500 000 projections and 2 by tuljapurkar approximation tuljapurkar 1982 all calculations were carried out with r statistical software r development core team 2019 using the popbio package stubben and milligan 2007 3 results 3 1 model parameterization 3 1 1 fecundity during the study period floaters comprised 8 48 averaging 30 of all adult birds on sakhalin and 6 33 averaging 23 in the amur region knowing the productivity of territorial pairs and the proportion of floaters we have estimated the fecundity of adults which varies between years from 0 09 to 0 27 averaging 0 19 fledglings per adult individual per annum on sakhalin and from 0 08 to 0 41 averaging 0 24 in the amur region table 1 3 1 2 fitting the weibull ageing model the estimate was obtained from the life histories of 367 birds of age 1 in the artificial population combined into a survival table table 2 the fitted weibull model fig 3 has the following parameters m 0 9 648 10 3 3 545 10 4 α 2 483 10 6 2 118 10 6 and β 2 936 0 267 the estimated value of the extrinsic mortality was obtained from the captive population to obtain the value of steller s extrinsic mortality in the wild the value of extrinsic mortality in captivity was corrected by the difference between captive and wild populations eq 5 12 m 0 w i l d 10 lg m 0 0 34 0 021 combining the terms of weibull model for steller s sea eagle in the wild we calculate the abundances of all age classes as well as the integral survival of adults 0 9562 which is close but somewhat higher than our previous estimation 0 95 based on survival data of the bald eagle and corresponding allometric equations romanov and masterov 2014 3 1 3 estimation of juvenile survival the estimation of juvenile survival rates was made from the juvenile to immature age ratio as was shown in section 2 5 2 from eq 10 it follows that the juv imm ratio can be derived from the immature to adult ratio and fecundity which are known from the field research table 1 this ratio averages 0 97 on sakhalin and 1 38 in the amur region these figures mean that one age cohort of juveniles almost equals or even outnumbers five age cohorts of immature individuals which can only be true if juveniles experience much higher mortality than the other age classes of immatures the calculated values of juvenile survival rates are 0 22 for sakhalin and 0 15 for the lower amur the corresponding probabilities to survive to maturity are 0 19 and 0 14 we can now determine the parameters of our model table 3 3 2 population growth rates analysis of the models indicates a decrease both for island and mainland populations according to the main scenario sakhalin and lower amur populations decrease by 0 60 and 0 95 per year respectively which means a halving time of 115 and 72 years respectively table 4 the models suggest that stabilising the sakhalin population would require the fecundity to increase to 0 23 fledglings per adult per year this enhancement can be achieved either by complete cessation of bear predation pressure scenario 2 or by recruiting part of the population reserve scenario 3 in the latter case the new stable population size will be 88 of the current level with the proportion of floaters decreasing from 30 to 16 in the lower amur stabilization can be achieved only at fecundity 0 32 fledglings per adult per year neither cessation of bear predation nor involvement of floaters into reproduction can stabilize the population in scenario 3 after exhaustion of the population reserve the population will continue to decline at the rate of 0 11 per year 3 3 analysis of elasticity the results of the elasticity analysis confirms the highest importance of adult survival as compared to other vital rates explaining 77 6 and 79 7 of the variation in population growth on the island and mainland fig 4 3 4 stochastic modelling results of stochastic modelling show a large span between individual trajectories fig 5 indeed the environmental conditions both on the island and mainland are highly variable for example the fecundity rate varies 3 fold sakhalin and 4 fold lower amur table 1 generally stochastic results are somewhat more optimistic as seen from the projections of deterministic and stochastic models and confirmed by comparing deterministic and stochastic lambdas table 5 in some cases the discrepancies are even reversing the model conclusions thus in scenario 2 the sakhalin stochastic model disagrees with the deterministic one and predicts the possibility of population growth at a moderate level of bear predation pressure which should be below 9 furthermore in scenario 3 for the amur region the stochastic model predicts population stabilization due to moffat s equilibrium at 95 of starting level whereas the deterministic model denies this possibility 4 discussion 4 1 low proportion of immatures and poor juvenile survival an important result of the modelling is the suggestion of poor juvenile survival based on the population age structure namely the low proportion of immature birds as compared to fledglings and adults according to our estimates only 19 of birds on sakhalin island and 14 in the amur region survive to maturity this result is supported by our radio telemetry results unpublished data from 2000 to 2012 177 eagles were tagged with radio transmitters as fledglings and then tracked with yagi antenna on nesting areas and wintering grounds the expected lifetime of the transmitters was about 7 years to test different models of survival we compiled data of signal recoveries into individual tracking histories on a yearly basis and processed with the program mark white and burnham 1999 using the cormack jolly seber procedure developed by lebreton et al 1992 only 64 of 177 tagged birds were encountered in subsequent years the best model is the simplest one φ pt where birds of ages 0 5 years are pooled into one class this model has the lowest value of aicc small sample corrected akaike information criterion and the annual survival of the pooled class of young birds estimated as 0 66 meaning that only 0 08 portion of fledglings survive to maturity however this estimate may be biased downwards due to transmitters failure other evidence of high juvenile mortality comes from the northern part of the steller s sea eagle range the magadan region potapov et al 2012 judging by the survival curve constructed from the results of satellite and radio telemetry only about 10 of eagles survive to an age of 6 years utekhina et al 2013 according to satellite telemetry data collected in 1997 1998 mcgrady et al 2000 kindly provided by mutsuyuki ueta only seven of 27 ptt transmitters exceeded their expected lifetime which varied from 6 to 18 months the rest of them stopped working or stopped moving which means either transmitter loss or bird death it is difficult to distinguish one from the other however if we assume that all premature terminations were caused by the bird death we come to conclusion that in the late 1990s only 26 30 of birds survived their first of year of life these estimates may seem low and need to be compared to related species sulawa et al 2010 estimated the annual survival rate of white tailed eagles in germany at 0 921 during the first 5 years of life and 0 76 on the sixth year which means 50 survival to the age of 6 in norway cumulative survival of white tailed eagles to maturity 5 6 years is even higher 0 71 nygård et al 2000 in florida the annual survival rate of young bald eagles was estimated at 0 72 0 81 in the first year 0 85 0 91 in the second year and 0 84 0 90 in the third year millsap et al 2004 assuming the latter value to be true for the three subsequent years we can calculate the survival till the age of 6 which is about 34 42 however low juvenile survival is not atypical for eagles stalmaster 1987 found that survival of juvenile bald eagles is the lowest of any stage in their life history undoubtedly because they must fend on their own for the first time stalmaster 1987 p 145 then the author gives several examples with estimates of survival to maturity varying from less than 10 percent up to at least 50 percent concluding that once an eagle has survived the first critical year or two of life its chances for continued life improve stalmaster 1987 p 146 on amchitka island aleutian isles the estimated survival rate during the first year after fledging was 10 sherrod et al 1976 for other raptors estimates of overall survival rates during the pre adult period were 12 8 19 7 in spanish imperial eagles aquila adalberti ferrer and calderón 1990 17 in eastern imperial eagles aquila heliaca katzner et al 2006 4 in african fish eagles haliaeetus vocifer brown 1980 12 in ospreys pandion haliaetus brown and amadon 1968 and 17 in red tailed hawks buteo jamaicensis brown and amadon 1968 these differing estimates see also a review of adult and pre adult survival rates in appendix a in whitfield et al 2004 demonstrate that survival of young sea eagles can be influenced by a number of factors such as habitat millsap et al 2004 food availability lobkov 2002 presumably migration distances e g klaassen et al 2014 and importantly climate and weather conditions discussed below on the coasts of the sea of okhotsk severe climate and weather conditions cannot but affect the survival rates of all age classes in steller s sea eagles especially the younger ones the weather is unstable and characterized by stormy winds abnormal heat or cold unfavourable water levels droughts and floods etc it is not uncommon for young eagles to find themselves in ecological traps during migration these traps are areas of fish rich rivers which remained open while other sections and the sea froze as winter progressed eagles that stayed too long in such places were then cut off from wintering grounds and eventually died potapov et al 2012 due to global climate changes such catastrophic events are becoming more and more frequent among other causes of death are direct persecution poaching poisoning by heavy metals and pcbs iwata et al 2000 kurosawa 2000 and disease our veterinary investigations romanov et al 2006 indicate that up to 64 of steller s chicks are infected with haemosporida blood parasites which can promote the development of several diseases increasing the chances of death there may also be other as yet unknown factors including anthropogenic ones to which the species has no evolutionary adaptations young birds are more susceptible to these extrinsic mortality factors first they may not have the experience to avoid hazards including ecological and hunter traps poisoned bats power poles roads etc second in their diet immature sea eagles are especially dependent on scavenging stalmaster 1987 dellasala et al 1989 which makes them more prone to poisoning road accidents and direct persecution they may also be further jeopardized by being both less wary and less agile than adult birds stone et al 2001 for example dellasala et al 1989 found that adult bald eagles avoided roads significantly more than immatures on sakhalin immature steller s sea eagles have shorter flush distances as compared to adults masterov et al 2018 etc finally in order to verify our results we should consider the possibility that the proportion of immatures was mistakenly underestimated this can be true if immature birds choose different habitats outside of the study area on sakhalin it is unlikely since one of the main sources of food there is lagoon bays where immature birds and floaters may form aggregations numbering a few dozen to several hundred such places of abundant food are known and are visited by researchers however it is theoretically possible that part of the non territorial fraction of the population moves to other places outside the study area such as the upper reaches of salmon spawning rivers in the amur region the proportion of immatures is even lower than on sakhalin though places where eagles congregate are also known there is also no guarantee that some immature birds do not move to places outside the study area historically there is a noticeable trend in the proportion of immatures in both populations to decrease on sakhalin in the early 1990s immature birds represented 30 8 38 4 in our counts masterov 1995 masterov et al 2000 in subsequent years the proportion started to decrease the decline being statistically significant masterov et al 2018 in 2004 2014 immature birds accounted for 10 25 averaging 16 of the population a similar trend though less pronounced and not significant was observed in the amur region in the 1990s the proportion of immatures averaged 28 masterov 2003 whereas at the end of the 2000s it ranged from 5 to 22 on average 15 thus we have to assume that either the eagles dramatically changed their ecology during the last three decades which is unlikely or a decrease in the number of immatures has really taken place 4 2 discrepancies between deterministic and stochastic model of two main components of the matrix population model the projection matrix and the vector of demographic structure modellers usually focus on analysing properties of the matrix considering the population vector to be of lesser importance indeed after just a few time steps the age structure converges from any initial state to the same stable age distribution which can furthermore be derived directly from the projection matrix caswell 2001 the interval of time when the age structure has not yet stabilized is called a transient period stott et al 2011 despite its brevity dramatic changes in population numbers are possible during this period ezard et al 2010 moreover if the environmental conditions are unstable the population age structure deviates from the stable distribution at each time step so that transient dynamics becomes a permanent state of the population hence the growth rate may depart far from the ones predicted by deterministic models tremblay et al 2015 in the ideal case stochastic lambdas should coincide with deterministic ones but it is not always so in practice tuljapurkar et al 2003 in our study stochastic modelling yields more optimistic results than the deterministic model in other cases stochastic lambdas are on the lower side wong and ticktin 2015 logofet et al 2018 logofet 2019 one of the possible reasons of these discrepancies is that the annual matrices are not completely independent and or identically distributed e g vital rates are density dependent crone et al 2013 or correlated in time these effects being not taken into account by the deterministic model may reveal themselves during stochastic modelling the more important fact however is that even if the predicted growth rate of a population is positive there are always chances of population decline or extinction occurring due to pure stochastic effects stott et al 2011 wong and ticktin 2015 species with long generation times are especially susceptible to fluctuations caused by transient dynamics koons et al 2005 therefore stochasticity can have major effects on the dynamics of the population and should be taken into account in modelling case studies 4 3 future perspectives of the populations simple demographic models are not a reliable tool for forecasting rather a sound way to quantify the population status crone et al 2013 a modeller here acts more like an accountant who prepares a company s balance sheet for the reporting period in this instance we have to report probable decline of both island and mainland populations even with relatively optimistic estimates of the stochastic model this result cannot but cause great concern about the fate of the eagles especially since it was obtained on the assumption of good survival of adults which is not guaranteed the moffat equilibrium scenario has shown a theoretical possibility of population stabilisation at lower levels however this purely theoretical result should not be taken as too encouraging since not all floaters are actually ready to breed even if such a possibility were to present itself sergio et al 2011 furthermore even if the lower equilibrium were achieved the population viability would be lower since the risk of extinction driven by stochastic events be higher at a smaller population size fox and gurevitch 2000 elasticity analysis expectedly identifies adult survival as the key vital rate affecting the population growth however our results show that the fecundity rate being at low levels can also be responsible for population decline furthermore this parameter is more amenable to management so that efforts should be focused on raising it to richer levels there are positive examples of population recovery in sea eagles resulting from an increased reproduction rate krüger et al 2010 therefore caution is needed when prospective modelling yields management recommendations 5 conclusions what will actually happen to the steller s sea eagle in these two regions and within its entire range fully depends on humans most of the threats and adverse factors affecting the eagles are due to human economic and recreational activities provided that a responsible attitude towards the protection of endangered species and conservation of the environment is exercised there is a potential to increase the productivity of both populations so as to restore the stability of this unique species further efforts should be focused on two areas first special studies are required to estimate the age class mortality and to understand the reasons behind it for juveniles and immatures this can be done by satellite and gsm gprs telemetry this will require inter regional and international cooperation since many deaths occur outside our study areas on migration routes and wintering grounds estimates of adult survival can be specified by non invasive genetic methods rudnick et al 2005 practical management actions should also be taken to improve the species reproductive performance as a temporarily measure we recommend installation of artificial perches and bear protection devices to a limited extent these measures have already been applied masterov and romanov 2016 and proven their effectiveness declaration of competing interest

24893,adult survival has long been believed to be the most important demographic parameter in long lived species such as large raptors with productivity being of secondary importance our studies of the steller s sea eagle haliaeetus pelagicus populations on the north east of sakhalin island and in the amur region russian far east in 2004 2017 have revealed highly unstable productivity that averages 0 53 and 0 61 fledglings per occupied territory per year respectively which is fairly low in comparison to previous decades about 1 fledgling per occupied territory per year the productivity varied between years within a 2 7 fold span being relatively low most of the time on sakhalin island the most serious hazard influencing eagle productivity is nestling predation by brown bears among other negative factors are adverse weather and food conditions habitat alteration disturbance at nest sites and on the mainland the hydrological regime of the amur river to assess the sustainability of both populations we have developed two matrix population models of the lefkovitch type the models predict a decline of both island and mainland populations these being halved in 115 and 72 years respectively apart from the main scenario 1 we considered two additional scenarios to stabilize the populations 2 cessation of bear predation and 3 enabling population regulation by involvement of floaters non territorial adults into the reproduction on sakhalin island increasing the fecundity under scenarios 2 and 3 could theoretically stabilize the population on the mainland the stabilization cannot be realized under either scenario stochastic modelling supports the main conclusion of population decline but generally its predictions are more optimistic some scenarios leading to different conclusions therefore though admitting the secondary importance of fecundity in large raptors as compared to adult survival we suggest that the fecundity can vary in broader limits and if at a poor level can alone lead to population decline on the other hand this parameter is more amenable to management so that efforts should be focused on raising it to higher levels stochasticity can have major effects on the population dynamics and should be accounted for in models keywords steller s sea eagle haliaeetus pelagicus matrix population model breeding performance bear predation russian far east 1 introduction animal populations are systems whose dynamics depend on changes in birth and mortality rates immigration and emigration neal 2004 in the case of species characterised by philopatry and site fidelity the exchange of individuals between populations is relatively low so the population trajectory is ultimately shaped by changes in birth and death rates krüger and lindström 2001 therefore population growth can be achieved by increase in productivity or survival since environmental resources are limited it is impossible to fully implement both strategies and there is always a trade off between investment in reproduction and investment in the maintenance of vital functions and ultimately in the survivorship recent advances in demography and population modelling showed that in long lived species population growth is usually most dependent on adult survival heppell et al 2000 saether and bakke 2000 maestri et al 2017 for such species the most important demographic parameter is individual survival especially of adults the reproduction rates being of lesser importance e g grier 1980 for example on sakhalin island each year a significant fraction of territorial steller s sea eagles 30 60 skip breeding masterov et al 2018 because it can be more expedient for the eagles to abandon breeding in seasons with unfavourable conditions in order to preserve themselves for future nesting attempts when conditions improve our long term monitoring study of two populations of the steller s sea eagle haliaeetus pelagicus in two of the main regions of its range on sakhalin island and in the amur region russian far east revealed a significant decline in eagle productivity during recent decades in sakhalin the productivity has decreased from 0 8 to 1 4 fledglings per occupied territory per year in the 1980s and 1990s masterov 1995 masterov et al 2000 to 0 54 fledglings per occupied territory per year in recent years masterov et al 2018 a similar situation is observed in the amur region where the productivity has been decreasing since the 1980s and in last decade was on average 0 64 fledglings per occupied territory per annum also the productivity varied within a 3 4 fold span between years of monitoring being relatively low most of the time at the same time steller s sea eagles appear to remain an abundant species in both regions with the nesting density in favourable habitats reaching high levels the only apparent change in their populations is a reduction of the immature fraction formerly the immature to adult ratio was about 0 43 0 67 but in recent years it has been only 0 18 0 20 masterov et al 2018 which may be evidence of population decline bildstein 2001 however this parameter alone is a poor indicator of population size katzner et al 2007 it is known that population changes can occur slowly with a certain time lag and often pass unnoticed until it is too late so the question arises is it possible that the worsening of such a presumably secondary parameter as productivity does lead to population decline to address this question we have developed matrix population models for both island and mainland populations estimated their growth rates simulated stochastic dynamics and considered effects of possible increases in productivity under several alternative scenarios these are 1 development as it is the main scenario 2 productivity increase by cessation of bear predation and 3 productivity increase by involvement of non territorial adults floaters into the reproduction 2 materials and methods 2 1 study objects steller s sea eagle is a large diurnal raptor whose nesting range is situated in the russian far east the global population is unlikely to exceed 7 thousand individuals masterov et al 2018 possessing high longevity a long period of maturation and comparatively low productivity ibid the eagle is a vivid example of a k strategist macarthur and wilson 1967 pianka 1970 or a civilized ponge 2013 species along with many other large raptors doub 2013 being evolutionary adapted to stable or predictable environments these species begin to lose their competitive ability if conditions become unstable ponge 2013 the eagles diet consists substantially of seafood fig 1 and their life cycle is tightly associated with fish rich water bodies sea coast bays lakes and rivers in sakhalin the eagles nest mostly in trees their main nesting habitats being forest tracts and fragments situated not far from water bodies typical eagle nests are large conspicuous structures approximately 1 5 2 m wide made of branches and normally placed in the upper part or on the top of a tree quite often a pair of eagles builds several nests choosing one for breeding in a given year other nests can either be used for other purposes perching feeding etc or abandoned one or several nests owned by one eagle pair together with the adjacent area constitute a nesting territory hardey et al 2009 territorial pairs can hold their territories for many years however not all nesting territories are occupied in sakhalin the annual territory occupancy averages 70 masterov et al 2018 the usual clutch is 1 2 rarely 3 eggs broods of three chicks are exceptionally rare the nests normally holding broods of 1 or 2 chicks however the mature fraction of the steller s population is non uniform the core of the population is formed by pairs of territorial birds breeders which occupy nesting territories and raise chicks thereby ensuring reproduction there is also a certain number of floaters non breeding adults which for various reasons do not occupy a territory penteriani et al 2011 on the one hand the presence of this group reduces per capita productivity number of fledglings per adult individual per year but on the other floaters form a population reserve occupying vacant territories when they appear thus floaters stabilise the number of breeding territories and eventually the overall population when the supply of floaters is exhausted the breeding population may decline precipitously wilcove and terborgh 1984 the abundance of this reserve may be especially significant for large populations that have achieved carrying capacity of the environment hansen and hodges 1985 palmqvist and vizcaíno 2003 in common buzzards of southern britain floaters may comprise 75 of adults kenward et al 2000 while in populations of large raptors such as the bald eagle floater to breeder ratio may equal 0 9 1 03 hunt 1998 floaters tend to concentrate on communal roosting areas together with immature eagles whereas breeders usually hunt within their territories among many factors influencing eagle productivity the most serious hazard is chick predation by brown bears on sakhalin island masterov et al 2018 other negative factors are adverse weather and food conditions habitat changes disturbances at nest sites and on the mainland the hydrological regime of the amur river 2 2 study areas the field studies were performed in two study areas situated in the russian far east on the north eastern coast of sakhalin island in 2004 2014 and in lower reaches of the amur river in 2006 2017 on sakhalin the study area is orientated from south to north encompassing the coasts of lunsky nabil nyyskiy chaivo and piltun bays together with the lower reaches of the rivers that flow into these bays the northern and southern boundaries of the study area correspond to latitudes 53 23 57 n and 51 11 14 n respectively and the length of the area from south to north is approximately 250 km the eastern boundary coincides with the coast line the western boundary lies at approximately 20 30 km from the coast depending on local hydrological characteristics including only the space that is potentially suitable for sea eagles the study area is approximately 3280 km2 the study area in the amur region referred to as lower amur encompasses the lower reaches of the amur river together with the channels of the amur floodplain and associated large and small lakes with rivers flowing into them the largest lakes are udyl kizi kadi irkutskoe and dudinskoe the northern and southern boundaries of the study area are 139 43 17 n and 139 44 18 n the western border passes along the river pilda 139 33 14 e with the eastern border bounded by the coast of the tatar strait the total area is about 4000 km2 2 3 field methods data were collected annually from the beginning of july until the end of august the field works included two main activities 1 working with nests and territories to estimate the eagles productivity and other aspects of breeding performance and 2 counts of eagles with the purpose of determining the age and territorial structure of the populations when working on nesting grounds we sought to examine every single nest and determine its status using the terminology outlined by postupalsky 1974 and specified by steenhof and newton 2007 we grouped nests into nesting territories on the basis of territorial proximity taking into account their occupancy status the doubled radius of the area around the nest that is defended by territory owners which is approximately 400 m masterov 1992 was used as a general criterion of nest proximity we also took into account the distribution and territorial behaviour of birds the number of inspected territories depended on weather conditions and other logistical constraints for example some territories become inaccessible at certain water levels etc every year we visited 124 283 territories on sakhalin and 20 200 territories in the amur region registered their status and if breeding took place determined the number of chicks including repeated examinations 3584 visits was made during the study period in order to convert our estimates of productivity from territorial pairs to all adult individuals including floaters we performed counts of the age and territorial structure of the sakhalin and lower amur populations during 2004 2017 we made more than 7 000 observations of eagles we aimed to avoid repeated counts within the same year but obviously the same individuals could be repeatedly met in different years adult immature and juvenile birds are well distinguished by their age specific plumage masterov et al 2018 the territoriality status of adults was initially identified in the field by expert judgment based on the birds behaviour e g territorial defensive courtship location relative to nesting areas and other circumstances of the observation habitat number of birds etc subsequently these estimates were revised on mapped data and the final judgment was made in doubtful cases adult birds registered farther than 1 5 km from the nearest sea eagle nest were classified as floaters the threshold being based on our observations and energetic constraints of the species masterov 1992 2 4 matrix model as a tool to describe the population dynamics of the steller s sea eagle we construct a birth pulse post breeding census stage structured matrix model 1 n t 1 a n t where t is discrete time n t is a vector representing the population stage structure and a is the so called lefkovitch projection matrix caswell 2001 logofet and klochkova 2002 the projection matrix possesses a number of features that can be interpreted in biological terms being therefore a valuable tool to model population dynamics in particular we calculate the dominant eigenvalue λ1 of a subscript 1 will be further omitted which represents the asymptotic population growth rate the corresponding left and right eigenvectors w and v which represent the stable stage structure and the reproductive value respectively in addition the elasticities of λ with regard to the elements of the projection matrix are calculated to estimate the relative importance of different vital rates for the population growth commonly in matrix models of sexually reproducing species reproduction is expressed in terms of female offspring per female caswell 2001 however there is no superfluous sex in monogamous raptors the presence of both pair members throughout nesting being virtually essential to brood survival hunt 1998 this is true for the steller s sea eagle which is characterised by equal sex ratio and monogamy masterov et al 2018 this allows us to ignore sex differences and calculate all the parameters including reproduction rates per adult individual the time step of the model is one year following our previous models romanov and masterov 2008 2014 we identify 7 age classes fig 2 juveniles juv represented by grown fledglings ready to leave their nests five classes of immature birds im1 im2 im3 im4 im5 represented by young birds in the age of 1 5 years and a single class of adults ad aged to 6 or more years 2 5 parameters and their estimation 2 5 1 productivity and fecundity in our field studies the eagles productivity was measured directly as the number of fledglings per occupied territory per territorial pair this vital rate is included in the model as fecundity i e productivity per adult individual since not all adults are breeders converting productivity to fecundity requires taking the territorial structure of the population into account if there were no floaters we could calculate fecundity simply by dividing productivity by two an additional correction is multiplying the obtained value by the proportion of breeders which we know from bird counts see section 2 3 2 5 2 adult and immature survival lacking the direct estimates of age specific mortalities we applied several different approaches to assess them indirectly first we used published data on survival within the captive steller s population in more than 90 zoos and nurseries across the world kurilovich 2016 to estimate survival probability after the first year of life we analysed the life histories of 367 individuals aged 1 years including 45 death events and obtained a survival curve then fitted an ageing model and applied corrections for the survival difference between captive and wild populations we chose the weibull ageing model 2 m x m 0 α x β where x is the age mx is the mortality at age x m 0 is the extrinsic occasional mortality α and β are coefficients determining the rate of ageing β determines the shape of the curve and α determines its scale because mortality can be split into two components extrinsic i e occasional m 0 and intrinsic related to ageing αxβ this allows us to correct extrinsic mortality for the difference between captive and wild populations as proposed by ricklefs 2000 the survival curve in the weibull model follows the equation 3 l x e x p m 0 x α x β 1 β 1 where lx is the proportion of the population surviving to age x other terms retain their values we fit this model using the weighted nls non linear least squares the weighting variable was the number of individuals under hazard since values of lx are not independent the goodness of fit statistics were obtained by randomization manly 2006 as recommended by ricklefs and scheuerlein 2002 once the model is fitted we have estimates of all parameters for the captive population which we can transfer to the wild population by introducing certain corrections according to ricklefs 2000 the rates of ageing in birds do not differ between wild and captive populations but the extrinsic mortality does the allometric equation connecting the extrinsic mortality with the body mass is 4 lg m 0 i s l g m where i is the intercept s is the regression slope and m is body mass g ricklefs showed that s is same in captive and wild populations and equals 0 43 but the intercept is different being 0 17 in captive and 0 17 in wild populations based on this equation we obtain the extrinsic mortality for the same species same body mass in the wild m 0 wild correcting lg m 0 in captivity by the difference between the intercepts i e 0 34 5 lg m 0 w i l d lg m 0 0 34 knowing m 0 α and β we can now calculate mortality and therefore survival for each particular age class this model can be further simplified for the adult age class since the adult fecundity is assumed to not depend on the bird s age the age distribution is unimportant this allows us to replace weibull ageing model with a negative exponential model having a single parameter adult survival probability pad for a stable population λ1 1 the total number of adults individuals of age 6 equates to the integral of the survival curve so that pad can be parameterized by the following equation 6 6 exp m 0 x α x β 1 β 1 d x 6 p a d x d x once pad is parameterized the negative exponential model produces at λ 1 the same number of adults hence the same number of offspring as weibull model so both models are equivalent in this sense the advantage of the negative exponential model is that its parameter of survival probability is constant so that we can apply it to our pooled adult class of birds 2 5 3 juvenile survival here the estimate follows our previous work romanov and masterov 2014 using the population method newton 1979 specifically it was derived from the juvenile to immature ratio since the abundances of age classes in the stable age structure are constrained to eq 1 and the eigenvalue equation a n λ n we can express the abundance of each class through those of the younger ones 7 n i m 5 n i m 4 p i m 4 λ 1 n i m 3 p i m 3 p p i m 4 λ 2 n i m 2 p i m 2 p i m 3 p i m 4 λ 3 n i m 1 p i m 1 p i m 2 p i m 3 p i m 4 λ 4 n j u v p j u v p i m 1 p i m 2 p i m 3 p i m 4 λ 5 where njuv is the number of juveniles nim 1 nim 2 nim 3 nim 5 are the numbers of immature individuals 1 5 years old respectively pjuv pim 1 pim 2 pim 3 pim 4 are the survival rates of the corresponding age classes and λ is the dominant eigenvalue a priori lambda is not known but we can calculate approximate values for a stable population assuming that λ 1 we can relate the juvenile to immature ratio to the survival rates of age classes 8 n i m m n j u v n i m 1 n i m 2 n i m 3 n i m 4 n i m 5 n j u v n j u v p j u v n j u v p j u v p i m 1 n j u v p j u v p i m 1 p i m 2 n j u v p j u v p i m 1 p i m 2 p i m 3 n j u v p j u v p i m 1 p i m 2 p i m 3 p i m 4 n j u v p j u v 1 p i m 1 p i m 1 p i m 2 p i m 1 p i m 2 p i m 3 p i m 1 p i m 2 p i m 3 p i m 4 where nimm is the total number of immatures from this equation we can express pjuv through the juvenile to immature ratio and the survival rates of immature age classes which are supposedly known from the parameterization of the weibull model 9 p j u v n i m m n j u v 1 p i m 1 p i m 1 p i m 2 p i m 1 p i m 2 p i m 3 p i m 1 p i m 2 p i m 3 p i m 4 the absolute numbers of juveniles and immatures in the study area are not known a priori but their ratio can be estimated by the immature to adult ratio and fecundity which are the proportions that have a common denominator 10 r i a f n i m m n a d n j u v n a d n i m m n j u v where ria is the immature to adult ratio in counts f is the fecundity of adults therefore 11 p j u v r i a f 1 p i m 1 p i m 1 p i m 2 p i m 1 p i m 2 p i m 3 p i m 1 p i m 2 p i m 3 p i m 4 2 6 three scenarios of population development we considered three possible scenarios of further development of the island and mainland populations differing by their fecundities scenario 1 is the main scenario which simulates population development as it is without any changes in fecundity scenario 2 the no predation scenario implies an increase in fecundity due to the cessation of bear predation the corresponding hypothetical no predation fecundity is calculated as the summarized number of fledged and depredated chicks per adult individual per year scenario 3 simulates an increase in fecundity by applying the moffat s equilibrium concept in a declining population floaters may occupy vacated territories and start to breed thus increasing the per capita productivity and therefore playing the role of a population reserve this mechanism of maintaining the balance of a population with the environment was proposed by c b moffat in 1903 moffat 1903 as an alternative for density dependent reductions in fecundity and survival and it is known to be the case in populations of territorial bird species such as raptors hunt 1998 2002 hence this scenario studies the potential capability of floaters to buffer population decline and stabilize the population the maximum possible fecundity that can be reached is the no floaters fecundity which is calculated as the number of fledged chicks per territorial individual per year to model the moffat s equilibrium scenario we separate breeders and floaters allowing transitions between them the central idea behind this concept is the carrying capacity of the landscape formalized by hunt 1998 as the number of serviceable breeding locations so that we have introduced the corresponding parameter for each population the parameter is assigned a value equal to the initial number of breeders in a population of 1000 individuals calculated from the field data on population structure divided by two here we follow the assumption than the number of breeders reflects the carrying capacity of the study area at each step of simulation if the number of breeders is below the carrying capacity then we replenish it with the corresponding number of individuals from the floater group unless it is fully exhausted as a result the per capita fecundity is increasing and the rate of decline is slowing down 2 7 introducing environmental stochasticity it was shown that in changing environments the population growth rate may differ from that predicted by a deterministic model tuljapurkar et al 2003 environmental conditions in different years vary greatly in terms of food abundance weather bear predation pressure and other factors that eventually result in different vital rates especially productivity masterov et al 2018 in order to simulate this stochasticity we use the sets of annual projection matrices based on the data of particular breeding seasons from those annual matrices we construct random sequences by the independent and identically distributed iid choice at each step caswell 2001 to project the population structure for 100 years we have simulated 104 sequences for each population stochastic growth rates are calculated 1 from constructing a very long random sequence 500 000 projections and 2 by tuljapurkar approximation tuljapurkar 1982 all calculations were carried out with r statistical software r development core team 2019 using the popbio package stubben and milligan 2007 3 results 3 1 model parameterization 3 1 1 fecundity during the study period floaters comprised 8 48 averaging 30 of all adult birds on sakhalin and 6 33 averaging 23 in the amur region knowing the productivity of territorial pairs and the proportion of floaters we have estimated the fecundity of adults which varies between years from 0 09 to 0 27 averaging 0 19 fledglings per adult individual per annum on sakhalin and from 0 08 to 0 41 averaging 0 24 in the amur region table 1 3 1 2 fitting the weibull ageing model the estimate was obtained from the life histories of 367 birds of age 1 in the artificial population combined into a survival table table 2 the fitted weibull model fig 3 has the following parameters m 0 9 648 10 3 3 545 10 4 α 2 483 10 6 2 118 10 6 and β 2 936 0 267 the estimated value of the extrinsic mortality was obtained from the captive population to obtain the value of steller s extrinsic mortality in the wild the value of extrinsic mortality in captivity was corrected by the difference between captive and wild populations eq 5 12 m 0 w i l d 10 lg m 0 0 34 0 021 combining the terms of weibull model for steller s sea eagle in the wild we calculate the abundances of all age classes as well as the integral survival of adults 0 9562 which is close but somewhat higher than our previous estimation 0 95 based on survival data of the bald eagle and corresponding allometric equations romanov and masterov 2014 3 1 3 estimation of juvenile survival the estimation of juvenile survival rates was made from the juvenile to immature age ratio as was shown in section 2 5 2 from eq 10 it follows that the juv imm ratio can be derived from the immature to adult ratio and fecundity which are known from the field research table 1 this ratio averages 0 97 on sakhalin and 1 38 in the amur region these figures mean that one age cohort of juveniles almost equals or even outnumbers five age cohorts of immature individuals which can only be true if juveniles experience much higher mortality than the other age classes of immatures the calculated values of juvenile survival rates are 0 22 for sakhalin and 0 15 for the lower amur the corresponding probabilities to survive to maturity are 0 19 and 0 14 we can now determine the parameters of our model table 3 3 2 population growth rates analysis of the models indicates a decrease both for island and mainland populations according to the main scenario sakhalin and lower amur populations decrease by 0 60 and 0 95 per year respectively which means a halving time of 115 and 72 years respectively table 4 the models suggest that stabilising the sakhalin population would require the fecundity to increase to 0 23 fledglings per adult per year this enhancement can be achieved either by complete cessation of bear predation pressure scenario 2 or by recruiting part of the population reserve scenario 3 in the latter case the new stable population size will be 88 of the current level with the proportion of floaters decreasing from 30 to 16 in the lower amur stabilization can be achieved only at fecundity 0 32 fledglings per adult per year neither cessation of bear predation nor involvement of floaters into reproduction can stabilize the population in scenario 3 after exhaustion of the population reserve the population will continue to decline at the rate of 0 11 per year 3 3 analysis of elasticity the results of the elasticity analysis confirms the highest importance of adult survival as compared to other vital rates explaining 77 6 and 79 7 of the variation in population growth on the island and mainland fig 4 3 4 stochastic modelling results of stochastic modelling show a large span between individual trajectories fig 5 indeed the environmental conditions both on the island and mainland are highly variable for example the fecundity rate varies 3 fold sakhalin and 4 fold lower amur table 1 generally stochastic results are somewhat more optimistic as seen from the projections of deterministic and stochastic models and confirmed by comparing deterministic and stochastic lambdas table 5 in some cases the discrepancies are even reversing the model conclusions thus in scenario 2 the sakhalin stochastic model disagrees with the deterministic one and predicts the possibility of population growth at a moderate level of bear predation pressure which should be below 9 furthermore in scenario 3 for the amur region the stochastic model predicts population stabilization due to moffat s equilibrium at 95 of starting level whereas the deterministic model denies this possibility 4 discussion 4 1 low proportion of immatures and poor juvenile survival an important result of the modelling is the suggestion of poor juvenile survival based on the population age structure namely the low proportion of immature birds as compared to fledglings and adults according to our estimates only 19 of birds on sakhalin island and 14 in the amur region survive to maturity this result is supported by our radio telemetry results unpublished data from 2000 to 2012 177 eagles were tagged with radio transmitters as fledglings and then tracked with yagi antenna on nesting areas and wintering grounds the expected lifetime of the transmitters was about 7 years to test different models of survival we compiled data of signal recoveries into individual tracking histories on a yearly basis and processed with the program mark white and burnham 1999 using the cormack jolly seber procedure developed by lebreton et al 1992 only 64 of 177 tagged birds were encountered in subsequent years the best model is the simplest one φ pt where birds of ages 0 5 years are pooled into one class this model has the lowest value of aicc small sample corrected akaike information criterion and the annual survival of the pooled class of young birds estimated as 0 66 meaning that only 0 08 portion of fledglings survive to maturity however this estimate may be biased downwards due to transmitters failure other evidence of high juvenile mortality comes from the northern part of the steller s sea eagle range the magadan region potapov et al 2012 judging by the survival curve constructed from the results of satellite and radio telemetry only about 10 of eagles survive to an age of 6 years utekhina et al 2013 according to satellite telemetry data collected in 1997 1998 mcgrady et al 2000 kindly provided by mutsuyuki ueta only seven of 27 ptt transmitters exceeded their expected lifetime which varied from 6 to 18 months the rest of them stopped working or stopped moving which means either transmitter loss or bird death it is difficult to distinguish one from the other however if we assume that all premature terminations were caused by the bird death we come to conclusion that in the late 1990s only 26 30 of birds survived their first of year of life these estimates may seem low and need to be compared to related species sulawa et al 2010 estimated the annual survival rate of white tailed eagles in germany at 0 921 during the first 5 years of life and 0 76 on the sixth year which means 50 survival to the age of 6 in norway cumulative survival of white tailed eagles to maturity 5 6 years is even higher 0 71 nygård et al 2000 in florida the annual survival rate of young bald eagles was estimated at 0 72 0 81 in the first year 0 85 0 91 in the second year and 0 84 0 90 in the third year millsap et al 2004 assuming the latter value to be true for the three subsequent years we can calculate the survival till the age of 6 which is about 34 42 however low juvenile survival is not atypical for eagles stalmaster 1987 found that survival of juvenile bald eagles is the lowest of any stage in their life history undoubtedly because they must fend on their own for the first time stalmaster 1987 p 145 then the author gives several examples with estimates of survival to maturity varying from less than 10 percent up to at least 50 percent concluding that once an eagle has survived the first critical year or two of life its chances for continued life improve stalmaster 1987 p 146 on amchitka island aleutian isles the estimated survival rate during the first year after fledging was 10 sherrod et al 1976 for other raptors estimates of overall survival rates during the pre adult period were 12 8 19 7 in spanish imperial eagles aquila adalberti ferrer and calderón 1990 17 in eastern imperial eagles aquila heliaca katzner et al 2006 4 in african fish eagles haliaeetus vocifer brown 1980 12 in ospreys pandion haliaetus brown and amadon 1968 and 17 in red tailed hawks buteo jamaicensis brown and amadon 1968 these differing estimates see also a review of adult and pre adult survival rates in appendix a in whitfield et al 2004 demonstrate that survival of young sea eagles can be influenced by a number of factors such as habitat millsap et al 2004 food availability lobkov 2002 presumably migration distances e g klaassen et al 2014 and importantly climate and weather conditions discussed below on the coasts of the sea of okhotsk severe climate and weather conditions cannot but affect the survival rates of all age classes in steller s sea eagles especially the younger ones the weather is unstable and characterized by stormy winds abnormal heat or cold unfavourable water levels droughts and floods etc it is not uncommon for young eagles to find themselves in ecological traps during migration these traps are areas of fish rich rivers which remained open while other sections and the sea froze as winter progressed eagles that stayed too long in such places were then cut off from wintering grounds and eventually died potapov et al 2012 due to global climate changes such catastrophic events are becoming more and more frequent among other causes of death are direct persecution poaching poisoning by heavy metals and pcbs iwata et al 2000 kurosawa 2000 and disease our veterinary investigations romanov et al 2006 indicate that up to 64 of steller s chicks are infected with haemosporida blood parasites which can promote the development of several diseases increasing the chances of death there may also be other as yet unknown factors including anthropogenic ones to which the species has no evolutionary adaptations young birds are more susceptible to these extrinsic mortality factors first they may not have the experience to avoid hazards including ecological and hunter traps poisoned bats power poles roads etc second in their diet immature sea eagles are especially dependent on scavenging stalmaster 1987 dellasala et al 1989 which makes them more prone to poisoning road accidents and direct persecution they may also be further jeopardized by being both less wary and less agile than adult birds stone et al 2001 for example dellasala et al 1989 found that adult bald eagles avoided roads significantly more than immatures on sakhalin immature steller s sea eagles have shorter flush distances as compared to adults masterov et al 2018 etc finally in order to verify our results we should consider the possibility that the proportion of immatures was mistakenly underestimated this can be true if immature birds choose different habitats outside of the study area on sakhalin it is unlikely since one of the main sources of food there is lagoon bays where immature birds and floaters may form aggregations numbering a few dozen to several hundred such places of abundant food are known and are visited by researchers however it is theoretically possible that part of the non territorial fraction of the population moves to other places outside the study area such as the upper reaches of salmon spawning rivers in the amur region the proportion of immatures is even lower than on sakhalin though places where eagles congregate are also known there is also no guarantee that some immature birds do not move to places outside the study area historically there is a noticeable trend in the proportion of immatures in both populations to decrease on sakhalin in the early 1990s immature birds represented 30 8 38 4 in our counts masterov 1995 masterov et al 2000 in subsequent years the proportion started to decrease the decline being statistically significant masterov et al 2018 in 2004 2014 immature birds accounted for 10 25 averaging 16 of the population a similar trend though less pronounced and not significant was observed in the amur region in the 1990s the proportion of immatures averaged 28 masterov 2003 whereas at the end of the 2000s it ranged from 5 to 22 on average 15 thus we have to assume that either the eagles dramatically changed their ecology during the last three decades which is unlikely or a decrease in the number of immatures has really taken place 4 2 discrepancies between deterministic and stochastic model of two main components of the matrix population model the projection matrix and the vector of demographic structure modellers usually focus on analysing properties of the matrix considering the population vector to be of lesser importance indeed after just a few time steps the age structure converges from any initial state to the same stable age distribution which can furthermore be derived directly from the projection matrix caswell 2001 the interval of time when the age structure has not yet stabilized is called a transient period stott et al 2011 despite its brevity dramatic changes in population numbers are possible during this period ezard et al 2010 moreover if the environmental conditions are unstable the population age structure deviates from the stable distribution at each time step so that transient dynamics becomes a permanent state of the population hence the growth rate may depart far from the ones predicted by deterministic models tremblay et al 2015 in the ideal case stochastic lambdas should coincide with deterministic ones but it is not always so in practice tuljapurkar et al 2003 in our study stochastic modelling yields more optimistic results than the deterministic model in other cases stochastic lambdas are on the lower side wong and ticktin 2015 logofet et al 2018 logofet 2019 one of the possible reasons of these discrepancies is that the annual matrices are not completely independent and or identically distributed e g vital rates are density dependent crone et al 2013 or correlated in time these effects being not taken into account by the deterministic model may reveal themselves during stochastic modelling the more important fact however is that even if the predicted growth rate of a population is positive there are always chances of population decline or extinction occurring due to pure stochastic effects stott et al 2011 wong and ticktin 2015 species with long generation times are especially susceptible to fluctuations caused by transient dynamics koons et al 2005 therefore stochasticity can have major effects on the dynamics of the population and should be taken into account in modelling case studies 4 3 future perspectives of the populations simple demographic models are not a reliable tool for forecasting rather a sound way to quantify the population status crone et al 2013 a modeller here acts more like an accountant who prepares a company s balance sheet for the reporting period in this instance we have to report probable decline of both island and mainland populations even with relatively optimistic estimates of the stochastic model this result cannot but cause great concern about the fate of the eagles especially since it was obtained on the assumption of good survival of adults which is not guaranteed the moffat equilibrium scenario has shown a theoretical possibility of population stabilisation at lower levels however this purely theoretical result should not be taken as too encouraging since not all floaters are actually ready to breed even if such a possibility were to present itself sergio et al 2011 furthermore even if the lower equilibrium were achieved the population viability would be lower since the risk of extinction driven by stochastic events be higher at a smaller population size fox and gurevitch 2000 elasticity analysis expectedly identifies adult survival as the key vital rate affecting the population growth however our results show that the fecundity rate being at low levels can also be responsible for population decline furthermore this parameter is more amenable to management so that efforts should be focused on raising it to richer levels there are positive examples of population recovery in sea eagles resulting from an increased reproduction rate krüger et al 2010 therefore caution is needed when prospective modelling yields management recommendations 5 conclusions what will actually happen to the steller s sea eagle in these two regions and within its entire range fully depends on humans most of the threats and adverse factors affecting the eagles are due to human economic and recreational activities provided that a responsible attitude towards the protection of endangered species and conservation of the environment is exercised there is a potential to increase the productivity of both populations so as to restore the stability of this unique species further efforts should be focused on two areas first special studies are required to estimate the age class mortality and to understand the reasons behind it for juveniles and immatures this can be done by satellite and gsm gprs telemetry this will require inter regional and international cooperation since many deaths occur outside our study areas on migration routes and wintering grounds estimates of adult survival can be specified by non invasive genetic methods rudnick et al 2005 practical management actions should also be taken to improve the species reproductive performance as a temporarily measure we recommend installation of artificial perches and bear protection devices to a limited extent these measures have already been applied masterov and romanov 2016 and proven their effectiveness declaration of competing interest

24894,species distribution models sdms are often criticised for lacking explicit linkage to ecological concepts we aim to improve the ecological basis of sdms by integrating prior knowledge about ecological preferences of organisms additionally we aim to support a systematic data driven review of such prior knowledge by confronting it with independent monitoring data using bayesian inference we developed a series of multi species distribution models msdms with increasing complexity to predict the probability of occurrence of taxa at sampling sites based on habitat suitability functions that are parameterized with prior ecological knowledge we subsequently assessed the models predictive performance with 3 fold cross validation so far if ecological preferences or functional traits have been used in sdms they were mainly used as fixed inputs without considering their uncertainty we take the additional step of considering uncertainty about preference parameters by including them as uncertain prior information that is subsequently updated with bayesian inference we apply the series of models in a case study on macroinvertebrates in swiss streams we analyse differences in the quality of fit changes in predictive performance and the potential to learn about the parameters from the data we consider ecological preferences for natural and human modified environmental factors including temperature flow velocity organic matter concentration insecticide pollution and substratum results indicate that updating prior knowledge on ecological preferences with bayesian inference rather than using it as fixed input improves model fit and predictive performance for example the predictive performance measured by the deviance for validation data improves by 17 and the explanatory power increases 3 8 times from a model that treats ecological preferences as fixed scores to a model that treats them as uncertain parameters the spatial distribution of many taxa including rare taxa with frequencies of occurrence down to about 5 which are difficult to model with sdms that do not consider prior information can be captured by the new models integrating prior knowledge as uncertain parameters in a bayesian framework establishes ecological interpretable links between taxa and their environment and supports a systematic revision and complementation of databases on ecological preferences even in case of poor or missing prior knowledge model outputs need to be carefully interpreted by modellers and experts on ecological preferences increased exchange between these research fields will benefit further integration of ecological preferences into sdms keywords bayesian inference ecological niches hierarchical modelling multiple stressors macroinvertebrates 1 introduction species distribution models sdms are valuable tools in ecology and environmental management as they support our understanding of how natural and human factors affect species distribution patterns guisan and zimmermann 2000 elith and leathwick 2009 a key strength of sdms is their ability to represent distribution patterns at large management relevant scales guisan and zimmermann 2000 however sdms have been criticised for lacking explicit linkage to ecological concepts elith and leathwick 2009 consequently outputs of sdms often do not increase our ecological knowledge and have only restricted management applicability guisan et al 2013 to strengthen the link between the empirical and theoretical knowledge to be included in sdms these models need to consider cause effect linkages between influence factors and species distributions separate effects of multiple stressors and produce predictions and knowledge that is applicable across regions and taxonomic compositions guisan et al 2013 several databases synthesizing ecological knowledge such as information on functional traits sensu mcgill et al 2006 and ecological preferences i e habitat requirements ecological niches are available for a wide range of organisms e g jones et al 2009 tachet et al 2010 kattge et al 2011 schmidt kloiber and hering 2015 integrating such knowledge into sdms can increase ecological interpretation of modelled patterns and the value of sdms for management and conservation evans et al 2015 moreover sdms integrating ecological knowledge of taxa in addition to pure taxonomical descriptions potentially have a wider applicability logez et al 2013 and can assist in separation of effects from multiple influence factors mondy et al 2012 szöcs et al 2014 often ecological databases pool knowledge from a variety of sources including controlled experiments and field observations through a process of literature review and expert validation schmidt kloiber and hering 2015 serra et al 2016 this compilation of existing ecological knowledge in databases facilitates its uptake and integration in sdms especially knowledge on ecological preferences related to habitat requirements or sensitivity to natural and human influence factors is well suited for integration into sdms as direct links with environmental influence factors can be made currently sdms integrating ecological knowledge regarding functional traits or ecological preferences e g rlq and fourth corner ordinations dray et al 2014 generalized joint attribute modelling gjam clark 2016 hierarchical modelling of species communities hmsc ovaskainen et al 2017 or hierarchical multi sdms and mixing models pollock et al 2012 jamil et al 2013 have mostly treated this knowledge as known inputs but see bennetsen et al 2016 who modify this knowledge based on field data and expert opinions and then use it as model input however both functional traits and ecological preferences are uncertain and may vary for example between local populations vermeiren et al 2015 or across life stages since functional traits can be observed at the level of individual organisms it does not make sense to infer them from species occurrences ecological preferences however cannot be deduced from observations at the individual level and there are several reasons why ecological preferences are considerably more uncertain than functional traits and thus might benefit from being treated as uncertain parameters in sdms first selection processes at different spatial scales influence species distributions through environmental filtering poff 1997 consequently species with ecological preferences that do not match the local conditions at a specific site will usually not occur at this site however additional factors influence species distribution patterns such as historical events dispersal biotic interactions and random processes that are not explicitly captured in ecological preference information leibold et al 2004 cadotte and tucker 2017 consequently the successful integration of ecological preferences into sdms to represent and predict species distribution patterns needs to consider such additional processes this has previously been achieved for instance via the use of mixed models or by adjustment for overprediction by a posteriori assembly rules guisan and rahbek 2011 d amen et al 2015 secondly the process of synthesising ecological preference information from various sources is not always traceable consequently the exact interpretation of ecological preferences presented in databases e g as an absolute limitation or rather as a looser restriction can be difficult additionally the actual boundaries between classes and even the link to a specific influence factor e g minimum temperature vs average temperature can be vague a final challenge relates to data limitations direct knowledge on ecological preferences of species through experimentation and observation can be hard to collect due to resource limitations however mining existing literature and species records can reveal a large amount of information which can be further augmented by expert opinions and traditional knowledge albeit knowledge gaps persist for certain groups of organisms costello et al 2010 additionally for organisms such as macroinvertebrates the taxonomic resolution of monitoring data can vary among taxa damanik ambarita et al 2018 and there can be a mismatch between the taxonomic resolution of the observational data and the preference information often taxonomic or phylogenetic relations are used to assign functional traits and ecological preferences for species with missing data e g poff 1997 guénard et al 2013 penone et al 2014 however ecological preferences in particular can vary even within genera serra et al 2016 hence while databases on ecological preferences contain valuable information a straightforward method to support the validation and complementation of preference knowledge with independent data will be useful we aim to improve the ecological interpretability of sdms by taking advantage of both existing prior knowledge regarding organisms ecological preferences available in databases and independently acquired monitoring data moreover to contribute to the synthesis of ecological knowledge we aim to support data driven learning about ecological preferences by confronting existing prior knowledge from databases with independent monitoring data that was not used for developing the preference databases therefore we conduct a stepwise development of several multi species distribution models msdms which explicitly utilize knowledge about ecological preferences to derive habitat suitability functions and subsequently use these habitat suitability functions to predict the probability of occurrence of individual taxa that make up the community at any given site we further refer to them as habitat suitability based multi species distribution models hs msdms we start with a purely knowledge driven model based only on the prior information about ecological preferences from the databases and the related environmental influence factors as inputs subsequently we estimate the relative importance of different environmental influence factors by assigning a weighting parameter to the habitat suitability regarding each influence factor and estimate its value using bayesian inference finally we treat the information about ecological preferences of taxa as uncertain prior knowledge about the parameters and allowing for a data driven learning regarding ecological preferences specifically we use bayesian inference to update prior knowledge about all model parameters now explicitly including parameters for ecological preferences of individual taxa based on independent monitoring data that has not been used earlier to derive the information about ecological preferences to the best of our knowledge our study is the first to integrate ecological preference information from databases as uncertain prior knowledge about the parameters to be updated using bayesian inference in sdms bayesian inference has been used successfully in other ecological research to build upon and revise current ecological knowledge mccarthy 2007 hobbs and hooten 2015 species distribution models are well suited to describe taxa responses to environmental influence factors however it cannot be a priori known if all important environmental influence factors are included in the model furthermore additional factors influence community assembly such as dispersal and biotic interactions hillerislambers et al 2012 the addition of a taxon specific parameter that modifies the probability of occurrence of an individual taxon at all sites can to some degree account for dispersal limitation of rare taxa in addition we implement a site effect which can modify the probability of occurrence of all taxa in the community jointly at each site analyzing spatial patterns of the site effect can facilitate the identification of additional factors or processes that can potentially improve the model by comparing the different versions of the hs msdms we address the following research questions 1 what does the increased model complexity in each step add to the ecological knowledge that can be gained from the hs msdm 2 to which degree does increasing model complexity affect model fit and predictive performance 3 how do spatial effects change model fit and predictive performance and do they support the identification of missing processes we use freshwater macroinvertebrates to illustrate and test our model concept macroinvertebrates often display strong niche associations leading to their successful application as indicators of human stressors e g schäfer et al 2007 menezes et al 2010 and giving a high potential for their ecological preferences to be used to predict distribution patterns 2 material and methods 2 1 modelling concept the hs msdms predict the probability of occurrence including the probability of detection of individual taxa that make up the community at individual sampling dates we assume that there was sufficient time for colonization so that the community reflects the environmental conditions at the site at a time scale of seasons to years the model describes the response of the community to changes in environmental conditions over these timescales without resolving short term dynamics including consequences of individual flood or pollution events this is compatible with the typical formulation of ecological preferences in databases representing time averaged responses and with common monitoring designs that include annual or seasonal sampling and avoid sampling shortly after disturbance events such as floods nonetheless we can include environmental influence factors that change between sampling seasons or years inputs to the hs msdms are the regional pool of taxa within the modelled area derived from biomonitoring data the environmental influence factors at sampling sites and dates either measured directly in the field or modelled from other influence factors and the ecological preference information extracted from the ecological databases of the taxa the concept underlying our modelling approach is to use ecological preferences from databases to formulate habitat suitability functions for each environmental influence factor the habitat suitability function quantifies on a scale from zero to one how the habitat suitability depends on the taxon and the environmental influence factor the habitat suitabilities then serve as direct inputs to the occurrence models instead of using the environmental influence factors directly as the habitat suitabilities are functions of the ecological preferences and the environmental influence factors the full model still describes occurrence probabilities of taxa in the community depending on the environmental influence factors however the intermediate step of using habitat suitabilities allows us to use prior information about ecological preferences which should be beneficial in particular for rarely occurring taxa that are difficult to model without using prior information in addition we can check the consistency of the ecological preference information in the database with the observed data and gain hints for improving this information in the following subsections we first describe the construction of the habitat suitability functions section 2 2 then the sequence of models analysed in this study sections 2 3 2 7 and finally the procedures and measures used for parameter estimation and model evaluation section 2 8 throughout this paper we use the following indices sites i 1 i sampling dates at site i t i 1 t i taxa j 1 j ecological preferences and corresponding environmental influence factors r 1 r 2 2 habitat suitability functions information regarding ecological preferences extracted from databases further referred to as ecological preference scores can be used to parameterize habitat suitability functions which output a taxon specific habitat suitability a normalized and interpolated preference score as a function of an environmental influence factor fig 1 we can either use the habitat suitability functions parameterized with the fixed ecological preference scores to calculate habitat suitabilities regarding each influence factor for each taxon at each site and date or we can consider the ecological preferences as uncertain parameters of the habitat suitability function to be updated with independent monitoring data jointly with the other model parameters in the latter case we directly enter the habitat suitability function and its ecological preference parameters into the model rather than calculating the habitat suitabilities as an intermediate step before running the model we construct habitat suitability functions h r x i t i r s j r u r for each ecological preference r e g temperature sensitivity that takes values normalized between 0 and 1 dependent on the corresponding environmental influence factor at that sampling site and date x i t i r e g a temperature of 17 c the normalized ecological preference scores of the taxon s j r and potentially additional parameters u r that influence the shape of the habitat suitability function for all taxa equally fig 1 see appendix a in supplementary material for further details on the construction of habitat suitability functions and appendix b in supplementary material for further details on habitat suitability normalization note that we refer to environment preference combinations by only referring to the index r as each ecological preference is uniquely linked to one corresponding environmental influence factor the shape of the habitat suitability functions and the number of ecological preference parameters depends on the formulation of the ecological preferences categorical continuous etc in the ecological databases for habitat suitabilities derived from preference scores that were specified for discrete intervals of a continuous environmental influence factor we avoided abrupt changes in habitat suitability at class boundaries by approximating a step function by a piecewise linear continuous function red dashed lines in fig 1a c evaluating the habitat suitability functions hr at all sites i and sampling dates ti for all taxa j and for all environmental influence factors r leads to a set of habitat suitabilities h i t i j r 1 h i t i j r h r x i t i r s j r u r for preference information specified by a classification of taxa into sensitive or insensitive e g to a particular pollutant we parameterized the habitat suitability for sensitive taxa as a continuous function of the pollutant concentration the suitability is 1 for insensitive taxa this leads to the use of additional parameters u r to specify the shape of the function as an example of such a function we used an s shaped function to relate the habitat suitability of sensitive taxa to the insecticide land use index which serves as a proxy for insecticide pollution 2 h r x i t i r s j r k 1 1 x i t i r s j r k 2 here s jr is the normalized ecological preference score 0 for insensitive 1 for sensitive taxa x i t i r is the corresponding pollutant proxy and k is an additional parameter that determines how fast the habitat suitability decreases with increasing values of x i t i r see fig 1e and appendix a1 in supplementary material the parameter k is not taxon specific it is part of the parameter vector u r introduced in eq 1 next we present our stepwise model development from a knowledge driven model that integrates ecological preference scores as direct fixed inputs to a model that treats ecological preferences as uncertain parameters to be included in bayesian inference we present the different steps to demonstrate different approaches of integrating prior knowledge on ecological preferences into hs msdms with increasing complexity and to assess the tradeoffs between model complexity and gain in ecological understanding and predictive performance additionally for the bayesian models we evaluate whether prior knowledge is supported by evidence from the data or if a revision of the ecological knowledge would lead to a better agreement of the model output with data 2 3 knowledge driven hs msdms m1 and m2 these models rely primarily on the prior knowledge about ecological preferences to derive probabilities of occurrence of taxa at given sites and dates different model versions use either the habitat suitability to each of the influence factors on their own or take the minimum or mean across the different habitat suitabilities model m1 assumes that the resulting habitat suitability can directly be interpreted as the probability of occurrence of the taxon at the site and date the m1 version that takes the minimum habitat suitability is described by eqs 3 5 the random variable y i t i j describes the occurrence of taxon j at site i and date ti y i t i j 1 encodes presence of the taxon y i t i j 0 encodes absence note that we use upper case letters for random variables and the same letter in lower case for its values given the habitat suitability h i t i j r for that taxon at that site and date for all environment preference combinations r the probability of occurrence is used to parameterize a bernoulli distribution eq 5 note that to simplify notation in the following model equations we omit the dependence on environmental conditions and known parameters but already introduce a vector θ of parameters to be estimated from the observations 3 p i t i j min r h i t i j r 4 p y i t i j 1 θ p m i n f o r p i t i j p m i n p i t i j f o r p m i n p i t i j 1 p m i n 1 p m i n f o r p i t i j 1 p m i n 5 p y i t i j θ p y i t i j 1 θ f o r y i t i j 1 1 p y i t i j 1 θ f o r y i t i j 0 the probabilities were bounded to the interval p m i n 1 p m i n by eq 4 to avoid data model conflicts in the cases of observed taxa with p i t i j 0 or unobserved taxa with p i t i j 1 for our application we chose p m i n 0 001 because all taxa occurred at least once in the data set with 563 samples data model conflicts would lead to a value of zero for the probability of the observed outcome and therefore to a value of zero of the likelihood for the whole community model m1 uses environmental conditions x given ecological preference scores s and potentially additional parameters u as input to the habitat suitability function to calculate all suitabilities h i t i j r according to eq 1 and used in eq 3 but does not have any parameters to be estimated from the data this means that the vector of parameters to be estimated for model m1 is empty θ by contrast in model m2 we introduce taxon specific factors f j which make it possible to adjust the probability of occurrence of each taxon individually based on its frequency of occurrence prevalence eq 6 this model requires the calibration of the parameters θ f j using independent monitoring data here and for the estimated parameters of the following models we use curly braces to indicate that this is a set across all values of the indices 6 p i t i j f j min r h i t i j r this extension allows us to account implicitly for additional factors that limit the occurrence of taxa such as dispersal limitations or competitive disadvantages not related to the environmental conditions included in the model we bounded the values of the factors f j to the interval 0 1 to avoid probabilities that exceed 1 in both models m1 and m2 we assume the ecological preference score to be 1 if prior information is missing 2 4 nonlinear hs msdms with fixed preference scores m3a and m3b model m3 extends the concept of generalized linear models glms for the probability of occurrence of taxa by replacing environmental influence factors by habitat suitabilities calculated from environmental influence factors using the habitat suitability functions hr we use a logistic transformation eq 7 logit link

diagram of this model is presented in fig 2 in this model the additional parameters u r in the habitat suitability functions hr consists of the parameter k that determines how fast the habitat suitability decreases with increasing pesticide land use index x according to eq 2 see figure in appendix a1 in supplementary material and a weighting factor for the contribution of urban areas use to insecticides pollution w u a see appendix c table c1 in supplementary material they are now also estimated rather than taken as a fixed value the set of estimated parameters of model m3a is then θ α j β r u r the structure of hs msdm m3a is non linear in its parameters as the suitabilities are not fixed but depend on parameters u r that are estimated jointly with the other parameters α j β r of the model the model is a multi species model as the coefficients β r are universal for all taxa and describe how strongly the community as a whole responds to the habitat suitability of each environmental influence factor r i e the parameters β r are inferred from a joint inference to the monitoring data of all taxa the model is not joint in the sense of parameterizing the residual correlation among taxa explicitly e g ovaskainen and soininen 2011 pollock et al 2012 warton et al 2015 the parameters α j which are inferred to adjust the probability of occurrence at all sites are taxon specific note that the habitat suitabilities are also taxon specific and thus allow for taxon specific responses to the environmental conditions model m3b further extends eq 8 by including a site effect γ i as an additive term in z i t i j eq 9 this term modifies the probability of occurrence of all taxa at the site and is also called a random effect in generalized linear mixed models e g bolker et al 2009 but see gelman 2005 9 z i t i j α j r β r h r x i t i r s j r u r γ i 10 γ i n 0 σ γ the site effects γ i are normally distributed with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation σ γ to be estimated during inference eq 10 repeated samples within the same site have the same site effect the site effect can therefore capture taxon independent spatial patterns not yet explained by the environmental influence factors in the model that are not dependent on the sampling time instead of a site effect that is constant over time one could also consider a sampling effect γ i t i that varies over sites and sampling times the analysis of site effects can help derive hypotheses on ecological causes for the observed patterns not yet considered in the model the set of estimated parameters of this model m3b is then θ α j β r u r γ i 2 5 non linear hs msdms with uncertain ecological preference parameters m4a and m4b the models m4a and m4b are based on the models m3a and m3b respectively eqs 7 9 however in the models m4a and m4b all preference scores now called preference parameters s j r are treated as uncertain parameters that are included in the inference the values from the ecological databases are used as the modes of uncertain prior distributions whose marginal posterior distributions are then derived by bayesian inference combining this prior information with evidence from the independent monitoring data e g national invertebrate biomonitoring data in our case study a subsequent comparison of prior and posterior marginal distributions then quantitatively demonstrates for which parameters we can learn from the monitoring data as for model m3a and m3b model m4a does not include a site effect while m4b does the sets of estimated parameters of these models m4a and m4b are θ α j β r s j r u r and θ α j β r s j r u r γ i respectively due to the inclusion of the preference parameters often multiple parameters per environmental influence factor and per taxon e g table 1 the number of parameters of this hs msdm becomes very large this does not necessarily lead to identifiability problems as we use prior knowledge about these parameters from the databases and do not leave the model the freedom to deviate strongly from them see section 3 3 below for details on priors 2 6 hierarchical non linear hs msdms m5a and m5b m5 models extend m4 models eqs 7 9 with a hierarchical structure in which the taxon specific parameters α j are constrained by an overarching community distribution which is a normal distribution with mean μα and standard deviation σα that are themselves estimated from the community data jointly with the other model parameters 11 α j n μ α σ α hierarchical model structures are suggested as an improvement when modelling whole communities because individual taxa especially rare taxa which often cannot be modelled individually can borrow information regarding their parameters from the overall community warton et al 2015 additionally there is often a lower risk of overfitting individual taxon parameters which should lead to more reliable predictions caradima et al 2019 model m5a does not include a site effect estimated parameters θ μ α σ α α j β r s j r u r while m5b does estimated parameters θ μ α σ α α j β r s j r u r γ i m5b is thus the most complex hs msdm including the site effect the uncertain preference parameters and the hierarchical community distribution of parameters α j 2 7 compilation to community models we assume that the observations of different taxa at different sites and sampling dates are independent of each other therefore the probability of any outcome y across taxa sites and sampling dates is given by the product of the probabilities for individual observations 12 p y θ j 1 j i 1 i t i 1 t i p y i t i j θ in this equation the probability p y i t i j θ refers to one of the models m1 to m5 introduced in the previous sections as some of the model equations of the more complex models build on the equations of the simpler models to clarify the definitions of all models the complete sets of equations used for each model and the estimated model parameters are listed in table 1 note that the models m3 and m4 use the same equations but differ in the parameters that are estimated by combining prior information with the observation data bayesian inference will be applied to estimate the parameters of the models m3 m5 as the priors depend on the case study and in particular on the chosen habitat suitability functions these priors are not part of the model description but part of the description of the model application section 3 3 2 8 parameter estimation and model evaluation when substituting the actual observations into eq 12 this expression becomes the likelihood function of the parameters we estimate the parameters for the model m2 by maximum likelihood parameter estimation the estimate is then given as those parameter values θ for which the log of the function p y θ according to eq 12 is maximum for the given observations y we do not conduct uncertainty estimation of these parameters as this model only serves as a reference for the more comprehensive models for the models m3 m4 and m5 we estimate the parameters by combining prior information described in section 3 3 below with evidence from the data and deriving a posterior parameter distribution f θ y by bayesian inference according to 13 f θ y f θ p y θ where f θ is the prior probability density of the model parameters we obtain a full posterior distribution including parameter uncertainty however some diagnostics are only calculated at the maximum of the posterior numerically maximum likelihood estimation for the model m2 was done using the function optim of r r core team 2019 bayesian inference of the parameters of the non linear models models m3 m4 and m5 was done numerically using a hamiltonian monte carlo algorithm implemented in the software stan interfaced from r through the package rstan stan development team 2019 appendix f in supplementary material all models are evaluated for their model fit during calibration to the whole dataset and for their predictive performance using three fold cross validation for the latter analysis we randomly split the monitoring data into three parts and tested predictions for each part based on model calibration for the other two parts we choose three folds to allow for a reasonable representation of rare taxa across the training and testing datasets two performance metrics are calculated for each taxon in each model for both model fitting training data and prediction testing data the standardized deviance for each taxon d j and for the full multi taxa model d describes the goodness of the model fit with smaller values indicating a better fit corresponding to minus two times the log likelihood divided by the number of available data points 14 d j θ 2 n j i 1 i t i 1 t i log p y i t i j θ d θ 2 n j 1 j i 1 i t i 1 t i log p y i t i j θ where nj is the number of available data points of taxon j either presence or absence and n is the total number of available data points across all taxa the standardized deviance corresponds to the mean square of the residuals of a model with normally distributed errors the d2 statistic 15 d j 2 θ d j null model θ d j proposed model θ d j null model θ quantifies the explanatory power of the influence factors analogous to the r2 statistic in linear regression guisan and zimmermann 2000 it describes the fraction of the deviance of the null model that is reduced by the model its value ranges between minus infinity and 1 with values closer to 1 indicating a higher explanatory power of the influence factors and values below zero representing a poorer fit than the null model the null model in this context contains only the taxon specific parameter α j β r and γ i are equal to zero and assumes no influence of environmental influence factors it corresponds to assuming a probability equal to the overall observed frequency of occurrence that is independent of the site all diagnostics d j d and d j 2 were evaluated at the maximum posterior parameter estimates for θ separately for the calibration and validation data subsets during 3 fold cross validation and for calibration to the full data set 3 model application to macroinvertebrates in swiss streams 3 1 monitoring data we derive presence absence data for macroinvertebrates from the nationwide swiss biodiversity monitoring program bdm overseen by the swiss federal office for the environment available from the midat central database https midat cscf ch last accessed 13 july 2017 the bdm focuses on nationwide biodiversity trends and conducts random sampling along a regular grid across switzerland we use data between 2010 and 2015 resulting in 563 sampling dates across 482 unique sampling sites the dataset contains 245 mostly rare taxa with 10 taxa occurring in more than half of the samplings and only 61 taxa in more than 10 of the samplings appendix d in supplementary material taxa have a taxonomic resolution up to species level for ephemeroptera plecoptera and trichoptera ept and remaining taxa at coarser levels specifically two taxa at phylum one at class three at order 67 at family and 25 at genus level the different taxonomic resolution is defined by the bdm monitoring program and relates among others to the cost and expertise to obtain detailed taxonomic identification the models treat taxa at different taxonomic levels equally we do not expect to predict well for all taxa especially the rare ones based on environmental influence factors alone nonetheless we include all sampled taxa in order to maintain a full overview of the biodiversity as resolved by the data note some taxa observations are removed due to uncertain species determination within species complexes see appendix e in supplementary material for details on this procedure and on the sample collection within the bdm data 3 2 ecological preferences and their link to environmental conditions prior information about ecological preferences for macroinvertebrates is extracted from the freshwaterecology info schmidt kloiber and hering 2015 spear liess et al 2008 and tachet databases tachet et al 2010 and is independent of the bdm monitoring data used in this study ecological preferences are linked to environmental influence factors appendix c in supplementary material that are expected to have a direct influence on organisms and thus a direct link to ecological preferences the use of direct influence factors as explanatory variables facilitates biological interpretation and should lead to more universal models than models based on indirect influence factors guisan and zimmermann 2000 where possible we derive direct influence factors from indirect factors e g for temperature saprobic condition and flow velocity because measurements of direct environmental factors are often unavailable for all sites in cases where the estimation of the direct influence factors was very uncertain we use indirect factors in the model e g a land use index as a proxy for insecticide pollution which is hard to quantify directly due to poorly known inputs and spatial and temporal heterogeneity the use of influence factors related to human activities allows us to use sdms to analyze changes in anthropogenic pressures and to evaluate management alternatives guisan et al 2013 we use five combinations of environmental influence factors with ecological preferences temperature temperature preference flow velocity current preference saprobic condition saproby insecticide land use index sensitivity regarding pesticides and substratum classes substratum preferences saproby refers to the sensitivity of macroinvertebrates to oxygen limitation resulting from the degradation of organic matter the insecticide land use index is an estimate of insecticide pollution considering different crops weighted for the average number of insecticide applications and urban areas see table c1 in supplementary material data about ecological preferences for temperature flow velocity saprobic condition and substratum classes is normalized to the range between 0 and 1 appendix b in supplementary material a piecewise linear continuous approximation is conducted over multiple discrete classes for temperature flow velocity and saprobic conditions and habitat suitabilities for specific sampling sites and dates are then derived from the habitat suitability function fig 1a c the habitat suitability for substratum is determined by a weighted average of the normalized ecological preference scores for the different classes multiplied by the proportion of each class within the site fig 1d data for pesticide sensitivity is binary sensitive insensitive and converted into a normalized habitat suitability as a function of the insecticide land use index fig 1e 3 3 prior probability distribution for the α j and β r parameters of the models m3 m5 we chose wide priors to primarily learn from the data nevertheless the model formulation given by eqs 7 and 8 together with the range of the habitat suitabilities from 0 to 1 indicate reasonable ranges of these parameters we can calculate a range of z values δz 90 for which the probability increases from 5 to 95 the variation in β r h i t i j r for each ecological preference r and across all sites should then not be much greater than that range the range is sufficiently large to significantly modify the probability for z values around 0 to well cover this range we chose a normal prior with standard deviation equal to δz 90 2 as we expect a positive response of the probability of occurrence with increasing habitat suitability we assume positive prior means of δz 90 2 to avoid inverse interpretation of the habitat suitabilities compensated by negative values of the parameters β r we truncated the priors of the parameters β r at zero in those models in which we estimated the ecological preference parameters s m4a b m5a b in the model application we consider five environmental factors and the parameter αj must be able to adjust the average probability as the habitat suitabilities are not centered but lead to a positive response in terms of values of z we chose a normal distribution for the prior of the parameters αj with a five times larger but negative mean 5δz 90 2 and used half of the absolute mean as the standard deviation we include insecticide pollution as an environmental factor which combines the effect of the proportion of urban areas with insecticide application rates iar using an estimated mean weighting factor for urban areas w u a of 0 6 appendix c in supplementary material we choose a lognormal prior with mean and standard deviation equal to 0 6 for this weighting factor additionally the parameter k min see appendix a in supplementary material used for parameterizing the dependence of the habitat suitability on iar for sensitive species needs to be in the order of 0 1 to have a relevant effect on the outcome 0 1 corresponds approximately to the 50th percentile of the data in the case study as we are uncertain about its value we use a lognormal distribution for the inverse of k min k invmax with mean and standard deviation equal to 10 as we want to avoid that the site effect γ i in the models m3b m4b and m5b explains the data rather than the environmental influence factors included in the models we select an exponential prior for its standard deviation σ γ with a mean equal to δz 90 8 the mean of the site effect is fixed at zero eq 10 for the ecological preference parameters inferred in the models m4 and m5 we choose normal distributions truncated to the interval 0 1 with the mean of the untruncated distribution centered at the normalized ecological preference score from the database and a standard deviation of 0 2 this informative prior results in the use of preference parameters similar to those in the database except in cases in which there is strong conflicting evidence in the data in the model m5 we include a normal prior distribution for the hyper parameter of the community parameter α with as mean the same prior distribution as for the α j in the non hierarchical model m4 as prior for the standard deviation of the community parameter α we use a lognormal distribution with a mean and standard deviation equal to the standard deviation of the priors of the α j parameters in the non hierarchical model m4 for all models we assumed the marginal priors of the individual parameters to be independent and used their product as the joint prior of all parameters 4 results 4 1 model fit and predictive performance the m1 models which are purely driven by prior knowledge on ecological preferences fit poorly to the whole dataset as shown by their high standardized deviances table 2 appendix g in supplementary material the fit improves when the relative frequencies of occurrence of individual taxa are taken into account in the m2 models however considering their d2 statistics they are still slightly worse than the null model which has a standardized deviance of 0 44 the m1 and m2 models are not considered further in view of their predictive performance the m3 model where each habitat suitability factor gets its own taxon independent weight and in which two parameters related to the consideration of pesticide sensitivity are estimated performs better than the null model table 2 a large improvement in model fit occurs when treating preference parameters as uncertain inputs and allowing them to shift based on evidence from the data m4 the extension of adding a site effect always improves model fit compare a and b versions of the models m3 m4 and m5 making the model hierarchical by applying overarching community parameters μ α σ α which constrain the taxon specific parameters α j does not change the results considerably compare m4 and m5 the predictive performance of the models measured as the mean standardized deviance for the 3 fold cross validation test datasets is always slightly poorer than the standardized deviance for model fitting to the whole dataset this reflects the fact that less data is available for model fitting when conducting 3 fold cross validation and that it is harder to predict new data than to fit to calibration data however the small difference between fit and validation indicates no serious problem with overfitting the predictive performance of the models with site effects is slightly better to those without 4 2 parameter estimates of habitat suitability based influence factors the values of the parameters β r indicate clearly identifiable positive effects of the habitat suitability for the model m3 fig 3 left panel the parameter values shift when ecological preference parameters are inferred in the m4 models specifically temperature preference gains in importance followed by saproby flow velocity and substratum preference whereas the sensitivity to insecticide decreases from a dominant to a typical response similar to other factors except temperature parameter estimates of the β r parameters influence each other therefore small differences between parameters e g between flow velocity substratum classes and insecticide land use index should not be over interpreted the estimates of the β r parameters remain relatively stable between the non hierarchical m4 and hierarchical m5 models as well as between models with and without site effect moreover estimates for all parameters remained stable across the 3 fold cross validation datasets for all models see fig 3 right panel for model m4 plots of the marginal posterior distribution of all estimated parameters for both training and 3 fold cross validation in model m4b are presented in appendix h in supplementary material 4 3 community overview the m4a model can discriminate presence absence observations for taxa with a frequency of occurrence down to about 5 fig 4 the discriminatory power of the m4a as well as m4b m5a and m5b is highest for taxa with an intermediate frequency of occurrence taxa that occur almost everywhere or occur only rarely have modelled probabilities of occurrence that are either always high or always low at all sites fig 4 for these taxa the m4a model fit is always good as indicated by the low standardized deviance of individual taxa fig 5 however for these taxa the explanatory power of the model is generally poor as indicated by d 2 statistics around 0 because the prediction is not influenced by the explanatory variables for example taxa with a relative frequency of occurrence below 10 obtained a mean standardized deviance of 0 17 0 14 and mean d 2 of 0 12 0 12 for the m4a model fitted to the whole dataset as taxa become more frequent the standardized deviance is expected to increase yet some taxa maintain low standardized deviances indicating a particularly good fit of the model to the distribution of these taxa an example is protonemura lateralis frequency of occurrence 53 with a standardized deviance of 0 48 leading to a good representation of its geographic distribution fig 6 appendix i in supplementary material provides overview statistics for all taxa additionally for some intermediately frequent taxa the environmental influence factors considered in the model have high explanatory power as indicated by individual taxa d2 statistics close to 0 5 such as p lateralis overall the model s main ecological potential lies with taxa with an intermediate frequency of occurrence that have a low standardized deviance and a high d 2 statistic 4 4 parameter inference for preference parameters a comparison between prior knowledge about ecological preferences from the databases and posterior distributions from inference of the m4a and m4b models illustrates the potential for improving preference information based on evidence from the data fig 7 an example is ecdyonurus helveticus relative frequency of occurrence 31 whose distribution is well represented by the m4a model fig 6 including a high explanatory power of the habitat suitability based influence factors d j 2 0 25 and a good individual model fit dj 0 78 the model results suggest a posterior preference for moderate stream temperatures that is higher than expected based on the prior ecological preference parameter values for this species fig 7 likewise the spatial distribution of leuctra braueri frequency of occurrence 43 is well represented by the model and the influence factors considered d 2 0 24 dj 0 41 fig 6 model outputs suggest that l braureri is less comfortable in cold and more comfortable in moderate temperatures than described by the prior knowledge fig 7 vermeiren et al submitted provides further ecological analyses of individual taxa patterns 4 5 taxa richness and site effects the hs msdms including site effects m3b m4b and m5b capture taxa richness better than models without site effects m3a m4a and m5a the model without site effect m4a does not resolve the dependence of richness on the influence factors very well fig 8 this leads to an overprediction of richness at sites with low observed richness and a tendency of underprediction at sites with high richness this is corrected by the site effect m4b nonetheless this model leads to an overprediction of species level richness the site effect is not strongly correlated with any of the environmental influence factors already included in the model highest correlation is 0 34 with temperature appendix j in supplementary material and thus represents other non modeled influence factors or ecological processes the site effect fig 9 leads to a reduced taxa richness in the alpine south to south east areas and an increased richness in the north and north west corresponding with the swiss plateau 5 discussion sdms have often been criticized for lacking an ecological basis underlying the modeled patterns elith and leathwick 2009 by including prior knowledge on ecological preferences linked to environmental variables the different hs msdms developed in the current study aim to increase the causal and ecological basis of sdms the poor results of the m1 hs msdm table 2 that predicts distribution patterns solely on existing knowledge about habitat suitabilities confirm that models which just consider the fundamental niche are not sufficient to predict species distributions ecological preference scores regarding different environmental factors are often quantified independently of each other and therefore they cannot necessarily be compared in absolute terms consequently simple aggregation rules such as the minimum or mean in model m1 are likely unsuitable to combine such independently derived habitat suitability factors nonetheless preference scores can provide an elegant way to include niche theory and landscape filter concepts into sdms for instance bennetsen et al 2016 combined habitat suitability indices his trapezoid shaped response curves of individual taxa against environmental variables as clustered hierarchical sets representing hierarchical environmental filters where the minimum suitability was taken across clustered sets of hsis within each hierarchical level in this case the hsis were all derived in a similar fashion and might therefore have been more suitable for combination using aggregation rules than the ecological preferences used in the current study these results encourage further interaction between sdm modelers and developers of ecological databases an alternative approach for aggregation is to account for different contributions of habitat suitability based influence factors by including weighting parameters such as the β r parameters in the model m3 which describe how strong the community as a whole responds to the habitat suitability of each environmental factor this improved model fit for the whole community and increased discriminatory ability for taxa with intermediate probabilities of occurrence compared to the models m1 and m2 similarly sdms such as those developed by pollock et al 2012 or ovaskainen et al 2017 include parameters to relate the influence of traits on the response of taxa to environmental factors in a hierarchical framework the multivariate nature of these and our m3 models also shows the value of accounting for multiple influence factors even if the interest lies in only one specific stressor elbrecht et al 2014 existing frameworks that integrate prior ecological knowledge e g regarding ecological preferences or functional traits to model distributions of taxa such as rlq and fourth corner ordinations dray et al 2014 generalized joint attribute modelling gjam clark 2016 hierarchical modelling of species communities hmsc ovaskainen et al 2017 or hierarchical multi sdms and mixing models pollock et al 2012 jamil et al 2013 have treated prior ecological knowledge as fixed model inputs in our case a substantial improvement in model fit occurs with the m4 models where knowledge on ecological preferences is treated as uncertain priors for model parameters in fact model fit during 3 fold cross validation improves by 17 and explanatory power increases 3 8 times from model m3 that treats ecological preferences as fixed scores to model m4 that treats them as uncertain parameters the good convergence of the m4 hs msdms indicates that treating knowledge about ecological preferences as uncertain does not cause identifiability issues for the large number of parameters in our model additionally given the good results even for taxa with frequencies of occurrence down to about 5 of samplings with the m4 models figs 4 and 5 hs msdms that include ecological preference as prior parameter values could provide a valuable tool to model less frequently occurring taxa note that we cannot expect to learn much for rare species from the data and that consequently the prior and marginal posterior distribution of the ecological parameters of these taxa are very similar however this illustrates the strength of using both prior knowledge and data to improve predictive performance for rare taxa existing frameworks could be extended to include uncertain prior ecological knowledge for instance gjam is a probabilistic framework and would allow for integration of uncertain trait knowledge clark 2016 likewise a bayesian implementation of the hmsc ovaskainen et al 2017 could be extended to also include uncertain prior knowledge regarding the sensitivities of taxa to environmental influence factors the additional treatment of prior knowledge as uncertain parameters would also benefit decision makers as it allows us to quantify the uncertainty in available knowledge and model outcomes langhans et al 2018 which is particularly relevant for groups such as macroinvertebrates where knowledge gaps persist and monitoring data can have varying taxonomic resolutions the integration of prior ecological knowledge into sdms can be a two way interaction hs msdms such as the m4 models that treat knowledge on ecological preferences as uncertain have a potential to contribute to complementing and revising ecological preference information a comparison of the prior from the database and posterior obtained from bayesian inference with independent monitoring data preference parameters illustrates the information gained from the data particularly for taxa where the influence factors have a high explanatory power marginal posterior parameter distributions gained from hs msdms can stimulate the discussion of ecological knowledge with experts to revise preference information in databases and improve models this discussion should also consider other potential factors that can lead to a disagreement between priors and posteriors such as the estimation of input variables or model structure deficits in general an increase in posterior preference scores compared to the prior provides stronger indication for a need for revision than a decrease as the latter could be caused by confounding factors not included in the model an in depth ecological analysis of hs msdm outcomes are presented in vermeiren et al submitted especially for the large number of macroinvertebrate taxa with a low frequency of occurrence other factors than the environmental factors included in the model likely affect their distribution such additional processes include dispersal limitation missing environmental influence factors neutral processes density dependent mass effects and biotic interactions leibold et al 2004 cadotte and tucker 2017 for ubiquitous taxa the environmental conditions are obviously not limiting and a null model that predicts a high probability of occurrence everywhere can hardly be improved the inclusion of site effects in models m3b m4b and m5b was aimed at supporting model development and ecological understanding by revealing residual patterns in taxa richness after accounting for the influence factors considered in the model fig 9 in our case study environmental factors not considered in the model could be increasing the taxa richness in the lowlands in addition isolation by distance or harsh environmental conditions due to hydrological disturbance could be hypothesized to explain the lower taxa richness negative site effect in the alpine regions the biogeography of a location as a result of past geological or climatic conditions or the emergence of physical barriers as well as evolutionary processes affecting genetic differentiation within species influence current day distribution patterns these factors are not yet included in the model but could be potential drivers to be considered in further work in fact alternative site effects e g representing bioregions as well as autocorrelation structures could be included in the model to capture spatial processes more explicitly domisch et al 2019 appendix j in supplementary material in contrast to some mechanistic ecosystem models e g schuwirth et al 2016 and sdms including biotic interactions for instance as interaction matrices kissling et al 2012 species interactions are not explicitly considered in the current hs msdms although biotic interactions can implicitly affect species responses to environmental factors and thereby affect their realized niches as captured in observational monitoring data extending and merging the hs msdms with joint sdms that explicitly account for residual correlations among species e g clark et al 2014 pollock et al 2014 inoue et al 2017 tikhonov et al 2017 caradima et al 2019 would allow exploration of the explicit role of biotic interactions or joint responses to unknown influence factors and may be an interesting line of future research the hierarchical structure m5 model did not improve model fit or predictive performance table 2 this result is likely specific to the well identifiable parameter that was made hierarchical for parameters that are less well identifiable for each taxon the gain in information from a hierarchical community structure can be more relevant for example including a hierarchical structure to describe spatial or intra community correlations could be an interesting further step model outputs need to be considered relative to the availability and quality of data on presence absence environmental influence factors and ecological preferences even with a huge effort to compile nationwide data on important environmental influence factors we cannot expect it to be complete for example we did not consider seasonal discharge patterns that can affect stream invertebrates and may vary from year to year wagner and schmidt 2004 other environmental factors such as water temperature and insecticide pollution are modeled using indirect influence factors because direct measurements were not available across the scale of our study this introduces additional uncertainty for these influence factors for example estimating insecticide pollution from agriculture requires detailed knowledge about hydrological connectivity payraudeau and gregoire 2012 which is not available on a swiss wide scale this also affects the interpretation of the model outcomes regarding the importance of influence factors which depends on the quality of the estimate of environmental influence factors furthermore the importance depends on the range of each influence factor that is covered by the input data therefore it is not surprising seeing a large effect of temperature given the fact that the data covers a wide range from alpine streams to the lowlands another source of uncertainty comes from the preferences for environmental factors such as temperature preferences which are interpolated across different temperature classes as sharp transitions at the class boundaries are hardly realistic additionally information about ecological preferences for some taxa is incomplete in fact information regarding temperature preferences was most incomplete among the ecological sensitivities considered in the case study this likely also contributed to the large shift in importance of the influence of temperature β t e m p when moving to models that allow temperature preference scores which in the current implementation would be assumed to be suitable when prior knowledge is missing to shift based on evidence from independent monitoring data compare models m3 and m4 fig 3 some studies suggest that functional trait information for such taxa can be pooled from related taxa poff et al 2006 bruggeman 2011 guénard et al 2013 penone et al 2014 and we do this also for preference parameters in the current study yet others argue that functional traits and ecological preferences can show a wide diversity even at fine taxonomic levels thereby limiting the possibility for information from related taxa to fill knowledge gaps serra et al 2016 our results suggest that hs msdms can include uncertain and even uninformative in case of missing data prior knowledge on ecological preferences and provide a way to complement and validate current knowledge with independent monitoring data 6 conclusions we developed a series of habitat suitability based multi species distribution models of increasing complexity that aim for strengthening the link between ecological preferences and the occurrence of taxa integrating prior knowledge from databases about ecological preferences in sdms in such a way establishes ecologically interpretable links between taxa and their environment moreover treating prior knowledge as uncertain parameters to be updated with independent monitoring data has the potential of improving prediction in the context of models that explicitly integrate prior knowledge indeed this was the case for our macroinvertebrate case study allowing predictions even for many rare taxa with frequencies of occurrence down to about 5 due to the joint structure of the model and the relatively narrow priors of the preference parameters the model parameters were well identifiable and the predictive performance during cross validation was only slightly worse than the fit to the data during calibration integration of prior knowledge into sdms in a bayesian framework can lead to a two way interaction prior knowledge from preference databases can improve the transferability of sdms and a comparison of prior and posterior preference parameters can support the revision of ecological databases indeed model based testing of ecological preference parameters is a valuable contribution to the continued development of databases on ecological preferences if results are carefully interpreted using biological expert knowledge and considering limitations of the model this fits perfectly in the general process of preference score delineation in which experts in the field evaluate propositions in an iterative process schmidt kloiber and hering 2015 serra et al 2016 the hs msdm model can assist in this process by increasing the objectivity of preference score propositions to be evaluated by experts by generating propositions for taxa about which we have limited prior knowledge and by evaluating the

24894,species distribution models sdms are often criticised for lacking explicit linkage to ecological concepts we aim to improve the ecological basis of sdms by integrating prior knowledge about ecological preferences of organisms additionally we aim to support a systematic data driven review of such prior knowledge by confronting it with independent monitoring data using bayesian inference we developed a series of multi species distribution models msdms with increasing complexity to predict the probability of occurrence of taxa at sampling sites based on habitat suitability functions that are parameterized with prior ecological knowledge we subsequently assessed the models predictive performance with 3 fold cross validation so far if ecological preferences or functional traits have been used in sdms they were mainly used as fixed inputs without considering their uncertainty we take the additional step of considering uncertainty about preference parameters by including them as uncertain prior information that is subsequently updated with bayesian inference we apply the series of models in a case study on macroinvertebrates in swiss streams we analyse differences in the quality of fit changes in predictive performance and the potential to learn about the parameters from the data we consider ecological preferences for natural and human modified environmental factors including temperature flow velocity organic matter concentration insecticide pollution and substratum results indicate that updating prior knowledge on ecological preferences with bayesian inference rather than using it as fixed input improves model fit and predictive performance for example the predictive performance measured by the deviance for validation data improves by 17 and the explanatory power increases 3 8 times from a model that treats ecological preferences as fixed scores to a model that treats them as uncertain parameters the spatial distribution of many taxa including rare taxa with frequencies of occurrence down to about 5 which are difficult to model with sdms that do not consider prior information can be captured by the new models integrating prior knowledge as uncertain parameters in a bayesian framework establishes ecological interpretable links between taxa and their environment and supports a systematic revision and complementation of databases on ecological preferences even in case of poor or missing prior knowledge model outputs need to be carefully interpreted by modellers and experts on ecological preferences increased exchange between these research fields will benefit further integration of ecological preferences into sdms keywords bayesian inference ecological niches hierarchical modelling multiple stressors macroinvertebrates 1 introduction species distribution models sdms are valuable tools in ecology and environmental management as they support our understanding of how natural and human factors affect species distribution patterns guisan and zimmermann 2000 elith and leathwick 2009 a key strength of sdms is their ability to represent distribution patterns at large management relevant scales guisan and zimmermann 2000 however sdms have been criticised for lacking explicit linkage to ecological concepts elith and leathwick 2009 consequently outputs of sdms often do not increase our ecological knowledge and have only restricted management applicability guisan et al 2013 to strengthen the link between the empirical and theoretical knowledge to be included in sdms these models need to consider cause effect linkages between influence factors and species distributions separate effects of multiple stressors and produce predictions and knowledge that is applicable across regions and taxonomic compositions guisan et al 2013 several databases synthesizing ecological knowledge such as information on functional traits sensu mcgill et al 2006 and ecological preferences i e habitat requirements ecological niches are available for a wide range of organisms e g jones et al 2009 tachet et al 2010 kattge et al 2011 schmidt kloiber and hering 2015 integrating such knowledge into sdms can increase ecological interpretation of modelled patterns and the value of sdms for management and conservation evans et al 2015 moreover sdms integrating ecological knowledge of taxa in addition to pure taxonomical descriptions potentially have a wider applicability logez et al 2013 and can assist in separation of effects from multiple influence factors mondy et al 2012 szöcs et al 2014 often ecological databases pool knowledge from a variety of sources including controlled experiments and field observations through a process of literature review and expert validation schmidt kloiber and hering 2015 serra et al 2016 this compilation of existing ecological knowledge in databases facilitates its uptake and integration in sdms especially knowledge on ecological preferences related to habitat requirements or sensitivity to natural and human influence factors is well suited for integration into sdms as direct links with environmental influence factors can be made currently sdms integrating ecological knowledge regarding functional traits or ecological preferences e g rlq and fourth corner ordinations dray et al 2014 generalized joint attribute modelling gjam clark 2016 hierarchical modelling of species communities hmsc ovaskainen et al 2017 or hierarchical multi sdms and mixing models pollock et al 2012 jamil et al 2013 have mostly treated this knowledge as known inputs but see bennetsen et al 2016 who modify this knowledge based on field data and expert opinions and then use it as model input however both functional traits and ecological preferences are uncertain and may vary for example between local populations vermeiren et al 2015 or across life stages since functional traits can be observed at the level of individual organisms it does not make sense to infer them from species occurrences ecological preferences however cannot be deduced from observations at the individual level and there are several reasons why ecological preferences are considerably more uncertain than functional traits and thus might benefit from being treated as uncertain parameters in sdms first selection processes at different spatial scales influence species distributions through environmental filtering poff 1997 consequently species with ecological preferences that do not match the local conditions at a specific site will usually not occur at this site however additional factors influence species distribution patterns such as historical events dispersal biotic interactions and random processes that are not explicitly captured in ecological preference information leibold et al 2004 cadotte and tucker 2017 consequently the successful integration of ecological preferences into sdms to represent and predict species distribution patterns needs to consider such additional processes this has previously been achieved for instance via the use of mixed models or by adjustment for overprediction by a posteriori assembly rules guisan and rahbek 2011 d amen et al 2015 secondly the process of synthesising ecological preference information from various sources is not always traceable consequently the exact interpretation of ecological preferences presented in databases e g as an absolute limitation or rather as a looser restriction can be difficult additionally the actual boundaries between classes and even the link to a specific influence factor e g minimum temperature vs average temperature can be vague a final challenge relates to data limitations direct knowledge on ecological preferences of species through experimentation and observation can be hard to collect due to resource limitations however mining existing literature and species records can reveal a large amount of information which can be further augmented by expert opinions and traditional knowledge albeit knowledge gaps persist for certain groups of organisms costello et al 2010 additionally for organisms such as macroinvertebrates the taxonomic resolution of monitoring data can vary among taxa damanik ambarita et al 2018 and there can be a mismatch between the taxonomic resolution of the observational data and the preference information often taxonomic or phylogenetic relations are used to assign functional traits and ecological preferences for species with missing data e g poff 1997 guénard et al 2013 penone et al 2014 however ecological preferences in particular can vary even within genera serra et al 2016 hence while databases on ecological preferences contain valuable information a straightforward method to support the validation and complementation of preference knowledge with independent data will be useful we aim to improve the ecological interpretability of sdms by taking advantage of both existing prior knowledge regarding organisms ecological preferences available in databases and independently acquired monitoring data moreover to contribute to the synthesis of ecological knowledge we aim to support data driven learning about ecological preferences by confronting existing prior knowledge from databases with independent monitoring data that was not used for developing the preference databases therefore we conduct a stepwise development of several multi species distribution models msdms which explicitly utilize knowledge about ecological preferences to derive habitat suitability functions and subsequently use these habitat suitability functions to predict the probability of occurrence of individual taxa that make up the community at any given site we further refer to them as habitat suitability based multi species distribution models hs msdms we start with a purely knowledge driven model based only on the prior information about ecological preferences from the databases and the related environmental influence factors as inputs subsequently we estimate the relative importance of different environmental influence factors by assigning a weighting parameter to the habitat suitability regarding each influence factor and estimate its value using bayesian inference finally we treat the information about ecological preferences of taxa as uncertain prior knowledge about the parameters and allowing for a data driven learning regarding ecological preferences specifically we use bayesian inference to update prior knowledge about all model parameters now explicitly including parameters for ecological preferences of individual taxa based on independent monitoring data that has not been used earlier to derive the information about ecological preferences to the best of our knowledge our study is the first to integrate ecological preference information from databases as uncertain prior knowledge about the parameters to be updated using bayesian inference in sdms bayesian inference has been used successfully in other ecological research to build upon and revise current ecological knowledge mccarthy 2007 hobbs and hooten 2015 species distribution models are well suited to describe taxa responses to environmental influence factors however it cannot be a priori known if all important environmental influence factors are included in the model furthermore additional factors influence community assembly such as dispersal and biotic interactions hillerislambers et al 2012 the addition of a taxon specific parameter that modifies the probability of occurrence of an individual taxon at all sites can to some degree account for dispersal limitation of rare taxa in addition we implement a site effect which can modify the probability of occurrence of all taxa in the community jointly at each site analyzing spatial patterns of the site effect can facilitate the identification of additional factors or processes that can potentially improve the model by comparing the different versions of the hs msdms we address the following research questions 1 what does the increased model complexity in each step add to the ecological knowledge that can be gained from the hs msdm 2 to which degree does increasing model complexity affect model fit and predictive performance 3 how do spatial effects change model fit and predictive performance and do they support the identification of missing processes we use freshwater macroinvertebrates to illustrate and test our model concept macroinvertebrates often display strong niche associations leading to their successful application as indicators of human stressors e g schäfer et al 2007 menezes et al 2010 and giving a high potential for their ecological preferences to be used to predict distribution patterns 2 material and methods 2 1 modelling concept the hs msdms predict the probability of occurrence including the probability of detection of individual taxa that make up the community at individual sampling dates we assume that there was sufficient time for colonization so that the community reflects the environmental conditions at the site at a time scale of seasons to years the model describes the response of the community to changes in environmental conditions over these timescales without resolving short term dynamics including consequences of individual flood or pollution events this is compatible with the typical formulation of ecological preferences in databases representing time averaged responses and with common monitoring designs that include annual or seasonal sampling and avoid sampling shortly after disturbance events such as floods nonetheless we can include environmental influence factors that change between sampling seasons or years inputs to the hs msdms are the regional pool of taxa within the modelled area derived from biomonitoring data the environmental influence factors at sampling sites and dates either measured directly in the field or modelled from other influence factors and the ecological preference information extracted from the ecological databases of the taxa the concept underlying our modelling approach is to use ecological preferences from databases to formulate habitat suitability functions for each environmental influence factor the habitat suitability function quantifies on a scale from zero to one how the habitat suitability depends on the taxon and the environmental influence factor the habitat suitabilities then serve as direct inputs to the occurrence models instead of using the environmental influence factors directly as the habitat suitabilities are functions of the ecological preferences and the environmental influence factors the full model still describes occurrence probabilities of taxa in the community depending on the environmental influence factors however the intermediate step of using habitat suitabilities allows us to use prior information about ecological preferences which should be beneficial in particular for rarely occurring taxa that are difficult to model without using prior information in addition we can check the consistency of the ecological preference information in the database with the observed data and gain hints for improving this information in the following subsections we first describe the construction of the habitat suitability functions section 2 2 then the sequence of models analysed in this study sections 2 3 2 7 and finally the procedures and measures used for parameter estimation and model evaluation section 2 8 throughout this paper we use the following indices sites i 1 i sampling dates at site i t i 1 t i taxa j 1 j ecological preferences and corresponding environmental influence factors r 1 r 2 2 habitat suitability functions information regarding ecological preferences extracted from databases further referred to as ecological preference scores can be used to parameterize habitat suitability functions which output a taxon specific habitat suitability a normalized and interpolated preference score as a function of an environmental influence factor fig 1 we can either use the habitat suitability functions parameterized with the fixed ecological preference scores to calculate habitat suitabilities regarding each influence factor for each taxon at each site and date or we can consider the ecological preferences as uncertain parameters of the habitat suitability function to be updated with independent monitoring data jointly with the other model parameters in the latter case we directly enter the habitat suitability function and its ecological preference parameters into the model rather than calculating the habitat suitabilities as an intermediate step before running the model we construct habitat suitability functions h r x i t i r s j r u r for each ecological preference r e g temperature sensitivity that takes values normalized between 0 and 1 dependent on the corresponding environmental influence factor at that sampling site and date x i t i r e g a temperature of 17 c the normalized ecological preference scores of the taxon s j r and potentially additional parameters u r that influence the shape of the habitat suitability function for all taxa equally fig 1 see appendix a in supplementary material for further details on the construction of habitat suitability functions and appendix b in supplementary material for further details on habitat suitability normalization note that we refer to environment preference combinations by only referring to the index r as each ecological preference is uniquely linked to one corresponding environmental influence factor the shape of the habitat suitability functions and the number of ecological preference parameters depends on the formulation of the ecological preferences categorical continuous etc in the ecological databases for habitat suitabilities derived from preference scores that were specified for discrete intervals of a continuous environmental influence factor we avoided abrupt changes in habitat suitability at class boundaries by approximating a step function by a piecewise linear continuous function red dashed lines in fig 1a c evaluating the habitat suitability functions hr at all sites i and sampling dates ti for all taxa j and for all environmental influence factors r leads to a set of habitat suitabilities h i t i j r 1 h i t i j r h r x i t i r s j r u r for preference information specified by a classification of taxa into sensitive or insensitive e g to a particular pollutant we parameterized the habitat suitability for sensitive taxa as a continuous function of the pollutant concentration the suitability is 1 for insensitive taxa this leads to the use of additional parameters u r to specify the shape of the function as an example of such a function we used an s shaped function to relate the habitat suitability of sensitive taxa to the insecticide land use index which serves as a proxy for insecticide pollution 2 h r x i t i r s j r k 1 1 x i t i r s j r k 2 here s jr is the normalized ecological preference score 0 for insensitive 1 for sensitive taxa x i t i r is the corresponding pollutant proxy and k is an additional parameter that determines how fast the habitat suitability decreases with increasing values of x i t i r see fig 1e and appendix a1 in supplementary material the parameter k is not taxon specific it is part of the parameter vector u r introduced in eq 1 next we present our stepwise model development from a knowledge driven model that integrates ecological preference scores as direct fixed inputs to a model that treats ecological preferences as uncertain parameters to be included in bayesian inference we present the different steps to demonstrate different approaches of integrating prior knowledge on ecological preferences into hs msdms with increasing complexity and to assess the tradeoffs between model complexity and gain in ecological understanding and predictive performance additionally for the bayesian models we evaluate whether prior knowledge is supported by evidence from the data or if a revision of the ecological knowledge would lead to a better agreement of the model output with data 2 3 knowledge driven hs msdms m1 and m2 these models rely primarily on the prior knowledge about ecological preferences to derive probabilities of occurrence of taxa at given sites and dates different model versions use either the habitat suitability to each of the influence factors on their own or take the minimum or mean across the different habitat suitabilities model m1 assumes that the resulting habitat suitability can directly be interpreted as the probability of occurrence of the taxon at the site and date the m1 version that takes the minimum habitat suitability is described by eqs 3 5 the random variable y i t i j describes the occurrence of taxon j at site i and date ti y i t i j 1 encodes presence of the taxon y i t i j 0 encodes absence note that we use upper case letters for random variables and the same letter in lower case for its values given the habitat suitability h i t i j r for that taxon at that site and date for all environment preference combinations r the probability of occurrence is used to parameterize a bernoulli distribution eq 5 note that to simplify notation in the following model equations we omit the dependence on environmental conditions and known parameters but already introduce a vector θ of parameters to be estimated from the observations 3 p i t i j min r h i t i j r 4 p y i t i j 1 θ p m i n f o r p i t i j p m i n p i t i j f o r p m i n p i t i j 1 p m i n 1 p m i n f o r p i t i j 1 p m i n 5 p y i t i j θ p y i t i j 1 θ f o r y i t i j 1 1 p y i t i j 1 θ f o r y i t i j 0 the probabilities were bounded to the interval p m i n 1 p m i n by eq 4 to avoid data model conflicts in the cases of observed taxa with p i t i j 0 or unobserved taxa with p i t i j 1 for our application we chose p m i n 0 001 because all taxa occurred at least once in the data set with 563 samples data model conflicts would lead to a value of zero for the probability of the observed outcome and therefore to a value of zero of the likelihood for the whole community model m1 uses environmental conditions x given ecological preference scores s and potentially additional parameters u as input to the habitat suitability function to calculate all suitabilities h i t i j r according to eq 1 and used in eq 3 but does not have any parameters to be estimated from the data this means that the vector of parameters to be estimated for model m1 is empty θ by contrast in model m2 we introduce taxon specific factors f j which make it possible to adjust the probability of occurrence of each taxon individually based on its frequency of occurrence prevalence eq 6 this model requires the calibration of the parameters θ f j using independent monitoring data here and for the estimated parameters of the following models we use curly braces to indicate that this is a set across all values of the indices 6 p i t i j f j min r h i t i j r this extension allows us to account implicitly for additional factors that limit the occurrence of taxa such as dispersal limitations or competitive disadvantages not related to the environmental conditions included in the model we bounded the values of the factors f j to the interval 0 1 to avoid probabilities that exceed 1 in both models m1 and m2 we assume the ecological preference score to be 1 if prior information is missing 2 4 nonlinear hs msdms with fixed preference scores m3a and m3b model m3 extends the concept of generalized linear models glms for the probability of occurrence of taxa by replacing environmental influence factors by habitat suitabilities calculated from environmental influence factors using the habitat suitability functions hr we use a logistic transformation eq 7 logit link function of a linear combination of the habitat suitabilities with coefficients β r and α j eq 8 7 p y i t i j 1 θ 1 1 e x p z i t i j 8 z i t i j α j r β r h r x i t i r s j r u r the conceptual diagram of this model is presented in fig 2 in this model the additional parameters u r in the habitat suitability functions hr consists of the parameter k that determines how fast the habitat suitability decreases with increasing pesticide land use index x according to eq 2 see figure in appendix a1 in supplementary material and a weighting factor for the contribution of urban areas use to insecticides pollution w u a see appendix c table c1 in supplementary material they are now also estimated rather than taken as a fixed value the set of estimated parameters of model m3a is then θ α j β r u r the structure of hs msdm m3a is non linear in its parameters as the suitabilities are not fixed but depend on parameters u r that are estimated jointly with the other parameters α j β r of the model the model is a multi species model as the coefficients β r are universal for all taxa and describe how strongly the community as a whole responds to the habitat suitability of each environmental influence factor r i e the parameters β r are inferred from a joint inference to the monitoring data of all taxa the model is not joint in the sense of parameterizing the residual correlation among taxa explicitly e g ovaskainen and soininen 2011 pollock et al 2012 warton et al 2015 the parameters α j which are inferred to adjust the probability of occurrence at all sites are taxon specific note that the habitat suitabilities are also taxon specific and thus allow for taxon specific responses to the environmental conditions model m3b further extends eq 8 by including a site effect γ i as an additive term in z i t i j eq 9 this term modifies the probability of occurrence of all taxa at the site and is also called a random effect in generalized linear mixed models e g bolker et al 2009 but see gelman 2005 9 z i t i j α j r β r h r x i t i r s j r u r γ i 10 γ i n 0 σ γ the site effects γ i are normally distributed with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation σ γ to be estimated during inference eq 10 repeated samples within the same site have the same site effect the site effect can therefore capture taxon independent spatial patterns not yet explained by the environmental influence factors in the model that are not dependent on the sampling time instead of a site effect that is constant over time one could also consider a sampling effect γ i t i that varies over sites and sampling times the analysis of site effects can help derive hypotheses on ecological causes for the observed patterns not yet considered in the model the set of estimated parameters of this model m3b is then θ α j β r u r γ i 2 5 non linear hs msdms with uncertain ecological preference parameters m4a and m4b the models m4a and m4b are based on the models m3a and m3b respectively eqs 7 9 however in the models m4a and m4b all preference scores now called preference parameters s j r are treated as uncertain parameters that are included in the inference the values from the ecological databases are used as the modes of uncertain prior distributions whose marginal posterior distributions are then derived by bayesian inference combining this prior information with evidence from the independent monitoring data e g national invertebrate biomonitoring data in our case study a subsequent comparison of prior and posterior marginal distributions then quantitatively demonstrates for which parameters we can learn from the monitoring data as for model m3a and m3b model m4a does not include a site effect while m4b does the sets of estimated parameters of these models m4a and m4b are θ α j β r s j r u r and θ α j β r s j r u r γ i respectively due to the inclusion of the preference parameters often multiple parameters per environmental influence factor and per taxon e g table 1 the number of parameters of this hs msdm becomes very large this does not necessarily lead to identifiability problems as we use prior knowledge about these parameters from the databases and do not leave the model the freedom to deviate strongly from them see section 3 3 below for details on priors 2 6 hierarchical non linear hs msdms m5a and m5b m5 models extend m4 models eqs 7 9 with a hierarchical structure in which the taxon specific parameters α j are constrained by an overarching community distribution which is a normal distribution with mean μα and standard deviation σα that are themselves estimated from the community data jointly with the other model parameters 11 α j n μ α σ α hierarchical model structures are suggested as an improvement when modelling whole communities because individual taxa especially rare taxa which often cannot be modelled individually can borrow information regarding their parameters from the overall community warton et al 2015 additionally there is often a lower risk of overfitting individual taxon parameters which should lead to more reliable predictions caradima et al 2019 model m5a does not include a site effect estimated parameters θ μ α σ α α j β r s j r u r while m5b does estimated parameters θ μ α σ α α j β r s j r u r γ i m5b is thus the most complex hs msdm including the site effect the uncertain preference parameters and the hierarchical community distribution of parameters α j 2 7 compilation to community models we assume that the observations of different taxa at different sites and sampling dates are independent of each other therefore the probability of any outcome y across taxa sites and sampling dates is given by the product of the probabilities for individual observations 12 p y θ j 1 j i 1 i t i 1 t i p y i t i j θ in this equation the probability p y i t i j θ refers to one of the models m1 to m5 introduced in the previous sections as some of the model equations of the more complex models build on the equations of the simpler models to clarify the definitions of all models the complete sets of equations used for each model and the estimated model parameters are listed in table 1 note that the models m3 and m4 use the same equations but differ in the parameters that are estimated by combining prior information with the observation data bayesian inference will be applied to estimate the parameters of the models m3 m5 as the priors depend on the case study and in particular on the chosen habitat suitability functions these priors are not part of the model description but part of the description of the model application section 3 3 2 8 parameter estimation and model evaluation when substituting the actual observations into eq 12 this expression becomes the likelihood function of the parameters we estimate the parameters for the model m2 by maximum likelihood parameter estimation the estimate is then given as those parameter values θ for which the log of the function p y θ according to eq 12 is maximum for the given observations y we do not conduct uncertainty estimation of these parameters as this model only serves as a reference for the more comprehensive models for the models m3 m4 and m5 we estimate the parameters by combining prior information described in section 3 3 below with evidence from the data and deriving a posterior parameter distribution f θ y by bayesian inference according to 13 f θ y f θ p y θ where f θ is the prior probability density of the model parameters we obtain a full posterior distribution including parameter uncertainty however some diagnostics are only calculated at the maximum of the posterior numerically maximum likelihood estimation for the model m2 was done using the function optim of r r core team 2019 bayesian inference of the parameters of the non linear models models m3 m4 and m5 was done numerically using a hamiltonian monte carlo algorithm implemented in the software stan interfaced from r through the package rstan stan development team 2019 appendix f in supplementary material all models are evaluated for their model fit during calibration to the whole dataset and for their predictive performance using three fold cross validation for the latter analysis we randomly split the monitoring data into three parts and tested predictions for each part based on model calibration for the other two parts we choose three folds to allow for a reasonable representation of rare taxa across the training and testing datasets two performance metrics are calculated for each taxon in each model for both model fitting training data and prediction testing data the standardized deviance for each taxon d j and for the full multi taxa model d describes the goodness of the model fit with smaller values indicating a better fit corresponding to minus two times the log likelihood divided by the number of available data points 14 d j θ 2 n j i 1 i t i 1 t i log p y i t i j θ d θ 2 n j 1 j i 1 i t i 1 t i log p y i t i j θ where nj is the number of available data points of taxon j either presence or absence and n is the total number of available data points across all taxa the standardized deviance corresponds to the mean square of the residuals of a model with normally distributed errors the d2 statistic 15 d j 2 θ d j null model θ d j proposed model θ d j null model θ quantifies the explanatory power of the influence factors analogous to the r2 statistic in linear regression guisan and zimmermann 2000 it describes the fraction of the deviance of the null model that is reduced by the model its value ranges between minus infinity and 1 with values closer to 1 indicating a higher explanatory power of the influence factors and values below zero representing a poorer fit than the null model the null model in this context contains only the taxon specific parameter α j β r and γ i are equal to zero and assumes no influence of environmental influence factors it corresponds to assuming a probability equal to the overall observed frequency of occurrence that is independent of the site all diagnostics d j d and d j 2 were evaluated at the maximum posterior parameter estimates for θ separately for the calibration and validation data subsets during 3 fold cross validation and for calibration to the full data set 3 model application to macroinvertebrates in swiss streams 3 1 monitoring data we derive presence absence data for macroinvertebrates from the nationwide swiss biodiversity monitoring program bdm overseen by the swiss federal office for the environment available from the midat central database https midat cscf ch last accessed 13 july 2017 the bdm focuses on nationwide biodiversity trends and conducts random sampling along a regular grid across switzerland we use data between 2010 and 2015 resulting in 563 sampling dates across 482 unique sampling sites the dataset contains 245 mostly rare taxa with 10 taxa occurring in more than half of the samplings and only 61 taxa in more than 10 of the samplings appendix d in supplementary material taxa have a taxonomic resolution up to species level for ephemeroptera plecoptera and trichoptera ept and remaining taxa at coarser levels specifically two taxa at phylum one at class three at order 67 at family and 25 at genus level the different taxonomic resolution is defined by the bdm monitoring program and relates among others to the cost and expertise to obtain detailed taxonomic identification the models treat taxa at different taxonomic levels equally we do not expect to predict well for all taxa especially the rare ones based on environmental influence factors alone nonetheless we include all sampled taxa in order to maintain a full overview of the biodiversity as resolved by the data note some taxa observations are removed due to uncertain species determination within species complexes see appendix e in supplementary material for details on this procedure and on the sample collection within the bdm data 3 2 ecological preferences and their link to environmental conditions prior information about ecological preferences for macroinvertebrates is extracted from the freshwaterecology info schmidt kloiber and hering 2015 spear liess et al 2008 and tachet databases tachet et al 2010 and is independent of the bdm monitoring data used in this study ecological preferences are linked to environmental influence factors appendix c in supplementary material that are expected to have a direct influence on organisms and thus a direct link to ecological preferences the use of direct influence factors as explanatory variables facilitates biological interpretation and should lead to more universal models than models based on indirect influence factors guisan and zimmermann 2000 where possible we derive direct influence factors from indirect factors e g for temperature saprobic condition and flow velocity because measurements of direct environmental factors are often unavailable for all sites in cases where the estimation of the direct influence factors was very uncertain we use indirect factors in the model e g a land use index as a proxy for insecticide pollution which is hard to quantify directly due to poorly known inputs and spatial and temporal heterogeneity the use of influence factors related to human activities allows us to use sdms to analyze changes in anthropogenic pressures and to evaluate management alternatives guisan et al 2013 we use five combinations of environmental influence factors with ecological preferences temperature temperature preference flow velocity current preference saprobic condition saproby insecticide land use index sensitivity regarding pesticides and substratum classes substratum preferences saproby refers to the sensitivity of macroinvertebrates to oxygen limitation resulting from the degradation of organic matter the insecticide land use index is an estimate of insecticide pollution considering different crops weighted for the average number of insecticide applications and urban areas see table c1 in supplementary material data about ecological preferences for temperature flow velocity saprobic condition and substratum classes is normalized to the range between 0 and 1 appendix b in supplementary material a piecewise linear continuous approximation is conducted over multiple discrete classes for temperature flow velocity and saprobic conditions and habitat suitabilities for specific sampling sites and dates are then derived from the habitat suitability function fig 1a c the habitat suitability for substratum is determined by a weighted average of the normalized ecological preference scores for the different classes multiplied by the proportion of each class within the site fig 1d data for pesticide sensitivity is binary sensitive insensitive and converted into a normalized habitat suitability as a function of the insecticide land use index fig 1e 3 3 prior probability distribution for the α j and β r parameters of the models m3 m5 we chose wide priors to primarily learn from the data nevertheless the model formulation given by eqs 7 and 8 together with the range of the habitat suitabilities from 0 to 1 indicate reasonable ranges of these parameters we can calculate a range of z values δz 90 for which the probability increases from 5 to 95 the variation in β r h i t i j r for each ecological preference r and across all sites should then not be much greater than that range the range is sufficiently large to significantly modify the probability for z values around 0 to well cover this range we chose a normal prior with standard deviation equal to δz 90 2 as we expect a positive response of the probability of occurrence with increasing habitat suitability we assume positive prior means of δz 90 2 to avoid inverse interpretation of the habitat suitabilities compensated by negative values of the parameters β r we truncated the priors of the parameters β r at zero in those models in which we estimated the ecological preference parameters s m4a b m5a b in the model application we consider five environmental factors and the parameter αj must be able to adjust the average probability as the habitat suitabilities are not centered but lead to a positive response in terms of values of z we chose a normal distribution for the prior of the parameters αj with a five times larger but negative mean 5δz 90 2 and used half of the absolute mean as the standard deviation we include insecticide pollution as an environmental factor which combines the effect of the proportion of urban areas with insecticide application rates iar using an estimated mean weighting factor for urban areas w u a of 0 6 appendix c in supplementary material we choose a lognormal prior with mean and standard deviation equal to 0 6 for this weighting factor additionally the parameter k min see appendix a in supplementary material used for parameterizing the dependence of the habitat suitability on iar for sensitive species needs to be in the order of 0 1 to have a relevant effect on the outcome 0 1 corresponds approximately to the 50th percentile of the data in the case study as we are uncertain about its value we use a lognormal distribution for the inverse of k min k invmax with mean and standard deviation equal to 10 as we want to avoid that the site effect γ i in the models m3b m4b and m5b explains the data rather than the environmental influence factors included in the models we select an exponential prior for its standard deviation σ γ with a mean equal to δz 90 8 the mean of the site effect is fixed at zero eq 10 for the ecological preference parameters inferred in the models m4 and m5 we choose normal distributions truncated to the interval 0 1 with the mean of the untruncated distribution centered at the normalized ecological preference score from the database and a standard deviation of 0 2 this informative prior results in the use of preference parameters similar to those in the database except in cases in which there is strong conflicting evidence in the data in the model m5 we include a normal prior distribution for the hyper parameter of the community parameter α with as mean the same prior distribution as for the α j in the non hierarchical model m4 as prior for the standard deviation of the community parameter α we use a lognormal distribution with a mean and standard deviation equal to the standard deviation of the priors of the α j parameters in the non hierarchical model m4 for all models we assumed the marginal priors of the individual parameters to be independent and used their product as the joint prior of all parameters 4 results 4 1 model fit and predictive performance the m1 models which are purely driven by prior knowledge on ecological preferences fit poorly to the whole dataset as shown by their high standardized deviances table 2 appendix g in supplementary material the fit improves when the relative frequencies of occurrence of individual taxa are taken into account in the m2 models however considering their d2 statistics they are still slightly worse than the null model which has a standardized deviance of 0 44 the m1 and m2 models are not considered further in view of their predictive performance the m3 model where each habitat suitability factor gets its own taxon independent weight and in which two parameters related to the consideration of pesticide sensitivity are estimated performs better than the null model table 2 a large improvement in model fit occurs when treating preference parameters as uncertain inputs and allowing them to shift based on evidence from the data m4 the extension of adding a site effect always improves model fit compare a and b versions of the models m3 m4 and m5 making the model hierarchical by applying overarching community parameters μ α σ α which constrain the taxon specific parameters α j does not change the results considerably compare m4 and m5 the predictive performance of the models measured as the mean standardized deviance for the 3 fold cross validation test datasets is always slightly poorer than the standardized deviance for model fitting to the whole dataset this reflects the fact that less data is available for model fitting when conducting 3 fold cross validation and that it is harder to predict new data than to fit to calibration data however the small difference between fit and validation indicates no serious problem with overfitting the predictive performance of the models with site effects is slightly better to those without 4 2 parameter estimates of habitat suitability based influence factors the values of the parameters β r indicate clearly identifiable positive effects of the habitat suitability for the model m3 fig 3 left panel the parameter values shift when ecological preference parameters are inferred in the m4 models specifically temperature preference gains in importance followed by saproby flow velocity and substratum preference whereas the sensitivity to insecticide decreases from a dominant to a typical response similar to other factors except temperature parameter estimates of the β r parameters influence each other therefore small differences between parameters e g between flow velocity substratum classes and insecticide land use index should not be over interpreted the estimates of the β r parameters remain relatively stable between the non hierarchical m4 and hierarchical m5 models as well as between models with and without site effect moreover estimates for all parameters remained stable across the 3 fold cross validation datasets for all models see fig 3 right panel for model m4 plots of the marginal posterior distribution of all estimated parameters for both training and 3 fold cross validation in model m4b are presented in appendix h in supplementary material 4 3 community overview the m4a model can discriminate presence absence observations for taxa with a frequency of occurrence down to about 5 fig 4 the discriminatory power of the m4a as well as m4b m5a and m5b is highest for taxa with an intermediate frequency of occurrence taxa that occur almost everywhere or occur only rarely have modelled probabilities of occurrence that are either always high or always low at all sites fig 4 for these taxa the m4a model fit is always good as indicated by the low standardized deviance of individual taxa fig 5 however for these taxa the explanatory power of the model is generally poor as indicated by d 2 statistics around 0 because the prediction is not influenced by the explanatory variables for example taxa with a relative frequency of occurrence below 10 obtained a mean standardized deviance of 0 17 0 14 and mean d 2 of 0 12 0 12 for the m4a model fitted to the whole dataset as taxa become more frequent the standardized deviance is expected to increase yet some taxa maintain low standardized deviances indicating a particularly good fit of the model to the distribution of these taxa an example is protonemura lateralis frequency of occurrence 53 with a standardized deviance of 0 48 leading to a good representation of its geographic distribution fig 6 appendix i in supplementary material provides overview statistics for all taxa additionally for some intermediately frequent taxa the environmental influence factors considered in the model have high explanatory power as indicated by individual taxa d2 statistics close to 0 5 such as p lateralis overall the model s main ecological potential lies with taxa with an intermediate frequency of occurrence that have a low standardized deviance and a high d 2 statistic 4 4 parameter inference for preference parameters a comparison between prior knowledge about ecological preferences from the databases and posterior distributions from inference of the m4a and m4b models illustrates the potential for improving preference information based on evidence from the data fig 7 an example is ecdyonurus helveticus relative frequency of occurrence 31 whose distribution is well represented by the m4a model fig 6 including a high explanatory power of the habitat suitability based influence factors d j 2 0 25 and a good individual model fit dj 0 78 the model results suggest a posterior preference for moderate stream temperatures that is higher than expected based on the prior ecological preference parameter values for this species fig 7 likewise the spatial distribution of leuctra braueri frequency of occurrence 43 is well represented by the model and the influence factors considered d 2 0 24 dj 0 41 fig 6 model outputs suggest that l braureri is less comfortable in cold and more comfortable in moderate temperatures than described by the prior knowledge fig 7 vermeiren et al submitted provides further ecological analyses of individual taxa patterns 4 5 taxa richness and site effects the hs msdms including site effects m3b m4b and m5b capture taxa richness better than models without site effects m3a m4a and m5a the model without site effect m4a does not resolve the dependence of richness on the influence factors very well fig 8 this leads to an overprediction of richness at sites with low observed richness and a tendency of underprediction at sites with high richness this is corrected by the site effect m4b nonetheless this model leads to an overprediction of species level richness the site effect is not strongly correlated with any of the environmental influence factors already included in the model highest correlation is 0 34 with temperature appendix j in supplementary material and thus represents other non modeled influence factors or ecological processes the site effect fig 9 leads to a reduced taxa richness in the alpine south to south east areas and an increased richness in the north and north west corresponding with the swiss plateau 5 discussion sdms have often been criticized for lacking an ecological basis underlying the modeled patterns elith and leathwick 2009 by including prior knowledge on ecological preferences linked to environmental variables the different hs msdms developed in the current study aim to increase the causal and ecological basis of sdms the poor results of the m1 hs msdm table 2 that predicts distribution patterns solely on existing knowledge about habitat suitabilities confirm that models which just consider the fundamental niche are not sufficient to predict species distributions ecological preference scores regarding different environmental factors are often quantified independently of each other and therefore they cannot necessarily be compared in absolute terms consequently simple aggregation rules such as the minimum or mean in model m1 are likely unsuitable to combine such independently derived habitat suitability factors nonetheless preference scores can provide an elegant way to include niche theory and landscape filter concepts into sdms for instance bennetsen et al 2016 combined habitat suitability indices his trapezoid shaped response curves of individual taxa against environmental variables as clustered hierarchical sets representing hierarchical environmental filters where the minimum suitability was taken across clustered sets of hsis within each hierarchical level in this case the hsis were all derived in a similar fashion and might therefore have been more suitable for combination using aggregation rules than the ecological preferences used in the current study these results encourage further interaction between sdm modelers and developers of ecological databases an alternative approach for aggregation is to account for different contributions of habitat suitability based influence factors by including weighting parameters such as the β r parameters in the model m3 which describe how strong the community as a whole responds to the habitat suitability of each environmental factor this improved model fit for the whole community and increased discriminatory ability for taxa with intermediate probabilities of occurrence compared to the models m1 and m2 similarly sdms such as those developed by pollock et al 2012 or ovaskainen et al 2017 include parameters to relate the influence of traits on the response of taxa to environmental factors in a hierarchical framework the multivariate nature of these and our m3 models also shows the value of accounting for multiple influence factors even if the interest lies in only one specific stressor elbrecht et al 2014 existing frameworks that integrate prior ecological knowledge e g regarding ecological preferences or functional traits to model distributions of taxa such as rlq and fourth corner ordinations dray et al 2014 generalized joint attribute modelling gjam clark 2016 hierarchical modelling of species communities hmsc ovaskainen et al 2017 or hierarchical multi sdms and mixing models pollock et al 2012 jamil et al 2013 have treated prior ecological knowledge as fixed model inputs in our case a substantial improvement in model fit occurs with the m4 models where knowledge on ecological preferences is treated as uncertain priors for model parameters in fact model fit during 3 fold cross validation improves by 17 and explanatory power increases 3 8 times from model m3 that treats ecological preferences as fixed scores to model m4 that treats them as uncertain parameters the good convergence of the m4 hs msdms indicates that treating knowledge about ecological preferences as uncertain does not cause identifiability issues for the large number of parameters in our model additionally given the good results even for taxa with frequencies of occurrence down to about 5 of samplings with the m4 models figs 4 and 5 hs msdms that include ecological preference as prior parameter values could provide a valuable tool to model less frequently occurring taxa note that we cannot expect to learn much for rare species from the data and that consequently the prior and marginal posterior distribution of the ecological parameters of these taxa are very similar however this illustrates the strength of using both prior knowledge and data to improve predictive performance for rare taxa existing frameworks could be extended to include uncertain prior ecological knowledge for instance gjam is a probabilistic framework and would allow for integration of uncertain trait knowledge clark 2016 likewise a bayesian implementation of the hmsc ovaskainen et al 2017 could be extended to also include uncertain prior knowledge regarding the sensitivities of taxa to environmental influence factors the additional treatment of prior knowledge as uncertain parameters would also benefit decision makers as it allows us to quantify the uncertainty in available knowledge and model outcomes langhans et al 2018 which is particularly relevant for groups such as macroinvertebrates where knowledge gaps persist and monitoring data can have varying taxonomic resolutions the integration of prior ecological knowledge into sdms can be a two way interaction hs msdms such as the m4 models that treat knowledge on ecological preferences as uncertain have a potential to contribute to complementing and revising ecological preference information a comparison of the prior from the database and posterior obtained from bayesian inference with independent monitoring data preference parameters illustrates the information gained from the data particularly for taxa where the influence factors have a high explanatory power marginal posterior parameter distributions gained from hs msdms can stimulate the discussion of ecological knowledge with experts to revise preference information in databases and improve models this discussion should also consider other potential factors that can lead to a disagreement between priors and posteriors such as the estimation of input variables or model structure deficits in general an increase in posterior preference scores compared to the prior provides stronger indication for a need for revision than a decrease as the latter could be caused by confounding factors not included in the model an in depth ecological analysis of hs msdm outcomes are presented in vermeiren et al submitted especially for the large number of macroinvertebrate taxa with a low frequency of occurrence other factors than the environmental factors included in the model likely affect their distribution such additional processes include dispersal limitation missing environmental influence factors neutral processes density dependent mass effects and biotic interactions leibold et al 2004 cadotte and tucker 2017 for ubiquitous taxa the environmental conditions are obviously not limiting and a null model that predicts a high probability of occurrence everywhere can hardly be improved the inclusion of site effects in models m3b m4b and m5b was aimed at supporting model development and ecological understanding by revealing residual patterns in taxa richness after accounting for the influence factors considered in the model fig 9 in our case study environmental factors not considered in the model could be increasing the taxa richness in the lowlands in addition isolation by distance or harsh environmental conditions due to hydrological disturbance could be hypothesized to explain the lower taxa richness negative site effect in the alpine regions the biogeography of a location as a result of past geological or climatic conditions or the emergence of physical barriers as well as evolutionary processes affecting genetic differentiation within species influence current day distribution patterns these factors are not yet included in the model but could be potential drivers to be considered in further work in fact alternative site effects e g representing bioregions as well as autocorrelation structures could be included in the model to capture spatial processes more explicitly domisch et al 2019 appendix j in supplementary material in contrast to some mechanistic ecosystem models e g schuwirth et al 2016 and sdms including biotic interactions for instance as interaction matrices kissling et al 2012 species interactions are not explicitly considered in the current hs msdms although biotic interactions can implicitly affect species responses to environmental factors and thereby affect their realized niches as captured in observational monitoring data extending and merging the hs msdms with joint sdms that explicitly account for residual correlations among species e g clark et al 2014 pollock et al 2014 inoue et al 2017 tikhonov et al 2017 caradima et al 2019 would allow exploration of the explicit role of biotic interactions or joint responses to unknown influence factors and may be an interesting line of future research the hierarchical structure m5 model did not improve model fit or predictive performance table 2 this result is likely specific to the well identifiable parameter that was made hierarchical for parameters that are less well identifiable for each taxon the gain in information from a hierarchical community structure can be more relevant for example including a hierarchical structure to describe spatial or intra community correlations could be an interesting further step model outputs need to be considered relative to the availability and quality of data on presence absence environmental influence factors and ecological preferences even with a huge effort to compile nationwide data on important environmental influence factors we cannot expect it to be complete for example we did not consider seasonal discharge patterns that can affect stream invertebrates and may vary from year to year wagner and schmidt 2004 other environmental factors such as water temperature and insecticide pollution are modeled using indirect influence factors because direct measurements were not available across the scale of our study this introduces additional uncertainty for these influence factors for example estimating insecticide pollution from agriculture requires detailed knowledge about hydrological connectivity payraudeau and gregoire 2012 which is not available on a swiss wide scale this also affects the interpretation of the model outcomes regarding the importance of influence factors which depends on the quality of the estimate of environmental influence factors furthermore the importance depends on the range of each influence factor that is covered by the input data therefore it is not surprising seeing a large effect of temperature given the fact that the data covers a wide range from alpine streams to the lowlands another source of uncertainty comes from the preferences for environmental factors such as temperature preferences which are interpolated across different temperature classes as sharp transitions at the class boundaries are hardly realistic additionally information about ecological preferences for some taxa is incomplete in fact information regarding temperature preferences was most incomplete among the ecological sensitivities considered in the case study this likely also contributed to the large shift in importance of the influence of temperature β t e m p when moving to models that allow temperature preference scores which in the current implementation would be assumed to be suitable when prior knowledge is missing to shift based on evidence from independent monitoring data compare models m3 and m4 fig 3 some studies suggest that functional trait information for such taxa can be pooled from related taxa poff et al 2006 bruggeman 2011 guénard et al 2013 penone et al 2014 and we do this also for preference parameters in the current study yet others argue that functional traits and ecological preferences can show a wide diversity even at fine taxonomic levels thereby limiting the possibility for information from related taxa to fill knowledge gaps serra et al 2016 our results suggest that hs msdms can include uncertain and even uninformative in case of missing data prior knowledge on ecological preferences and provide a way to complement and validate current knowledge with independent monitoring data 6 conclusions we developed a series of habitat suitability based multi species distribution models of increasing complexity that aim for strengthening the link between ecological preferences and the occurrence of taxa integrating prior knowledge from databases about ecological preferences in sdms in such a way establishes ecologically interpretable links between taxa and their environment moreover treating prior knowledge as uncertain parameters to be updated with independent monitoring data has the potential of improving prediction in the context of models that explicitly integrate prior knowledge indeed this was the case for our macroinvertebrate case study allowing predictions even for many rare taxa with frequencies of occurrence down to about 5 due to the joint structure of the model and the relatively narrow priors of the preference parameters the model parameters were well identifiable and the predictive performance during cross validation was only slightly worse than the fit to the data during calibration integration of prior knowledge into sdms in a bayesian framework can lead to a two way interaction prior knowledge from preference databases can improve the transferability of sdms and a comparison of prior and posterior preference parameters can support the revision of ecological databases indeed model based testing of ecological preference parameters is a valuable contribution to the continued development of databases on ecological preferences if results are carefully interpreted using biological expert knowledge and considering limitations of the model this fits perfectly in the general process of preference score delineation in which experts in the field evaluate propositions in an iterative process schmidt kloiber and hering 2015 serra et al 2016 the hs msdm model can assist in this process by increasing the objectivity of preference score propositions to be evaluated by experts by generating propositions for taxa about which we have limited prior knowledge and by evaluating the transferability of current fixed preference scores to other regions or future scenarios declarations peter vermeiren conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis data curation
