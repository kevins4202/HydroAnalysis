5250,with global warming and aggravation due to human activities many lakes on earth are facing a series of worsening environmental problems such as shrinking areas and declining water quality poyang lake is the largest freshwater lake in china an important wetland in the world and the largest migratory bird habitat in asia the ecological environment of the lake has a widespread influence and has attracted international attention it is necessary to use long term frequent satellite observations to investigate the poyang lake due to its high frequency fluctuations characteristics however most remote sensing data cover only a short period of time which cannot reflect the long term change to the poyang lake water no satellite mission currently fits such requirements based on hj 1a b and landsat data from 1989 to 2018 the dynamic changes in water quantity in poyang lake are monitored in this paper and the influencing factors and ecological impacts of the changes are analyzed the results show that in terms of the water area change trend on the annual scale the annual mean values of water area and water volume exhibit overall decreasing trends the water area was the largest in 1998 at 4068 33 km2 and smallest in 2014 at 899 68 km2 the water volume was largest in 1992 at 25 810 million m3 and smallest in 2014 at 5880 million m3 on the monthly scale the water area was the smallest in january largest in july and showed an increasing trend from january to july subsequently a decreasing trend was observed from august to january the water volume was smallest in february largest in july and showed an increasing trend from february to july then a decreasing trend was observed from august to february the water volume of poyang lake is affected by seasonal changes in precipitation and the correlation coefficient between monthly precipitation and monthly water volume is 0 603 p 0 05 in summer the water volume is affected by the water level in the yangtze river the construction of the three gorges dam in the yangtze river caused a prolonged duration of the low water period and an advanced low water period which are also important factors affecting the water volume change in terms of the impact of water volume on ecology the relationship between water volume and nh3 n concentration is obvious with a correlation coefficient of 0 679 p 0 01 a large water volume will increase the lake water level reduce the habitats for migratory birds and provide food to fewer migratory birds keywords dense long time series data poyang lake dynamic changes influencing factors ecological impact 1 introduction lakes act as fulcra of the interactions among the spheres of the earth s surface system and are an important part of the terrestrial hydrosphere lakes are closely related to the biosphere atmosphere lithosphere and so on lakes have special functions in regulating the regional climate recording regional environmental changes maintaining regional ecosystem balance and increasing biodiversity with global warming and aggravation due to human activities inland water bodies especially lakes are facing a series of worsening problems such as reductions in area and declining water quality such as eutrophication which seriously threaten the normal ecological functions of lakes bryant 2009 bianduo et al 2009 hinkel et al 2007 smith et al 2005 in the past few decades many lakes throughout the world have changed in terms of size shape and ecology awange et al 2008 george et al 2007 stevenson et al 2010 monitoring lake water body changes is related not only to the sustainable development of the lake basin but also to the sustainable development of the regional ecological economy the changes in a water body are affected by climate conditions artificial regulation and storage and other factors the characteristics of short term continuous fluctuations are obvious single date images cannot reflect the dynamic changes in a water body long term dynamic monitoring is the main direction of the current water body research muala et al 2014 song et al 2013 the methods for the research on water dynamic changes are mainly divided into traditional hydrological solution algorithms and spatial information technology simulations traditional hydrological solution methods guirguis et al 1996 crétaux et al 2005 medina et al 2010 can be used to obtain accurate water storage data however the accuracy is related to the quality of the bathymetry data the disadvantage of this method is that the acquisition of terrain data requires considerable manpower and material resources the emergence of space information technology especially remote sensing makes it possible to continuously observe the earth in a wide ranging multiphase and low cost way a water body has characteristically low reflectivity in the visible which makes water bodies easy to extract remote sensing technology has gradually become an important means of monitoring which has been widely used in inland lakes and coastal water change monitoring ma et al 2010 muala et al 2014 as the largest freshwater lake in china poyang lake experiences a very significant seasonal change in lake area the seasonal alteration of water and land provides good conditions for the development of wetland ecosystems along the marshland lakeshores every year thousands of migratory birds move to this area to winter this lake is a wetland of international importance and the largest migratory bird habitat in asia shankman and liang 2003 xiong and li 2002 the ecological environment of this lake has a wide range of effects and is the focus of international concern the fluctuation in water level is the main factor affecting the lake wetland ecosystem nõges and nõges 1999 under the influence of the monsoon climate the seasonal change in precipitation in the poyang lake area is very significant which increases the dynamic changes in the lake water area larger at the same time due to the complex hydrological conditions the area surrounding poyang lake has always experienced some of the most serious flood and drought disasters in china in recent years the frequency and intensity of disasters have increased significantly in addition to natural factors human factors also directly or indirectly affect the frequency and severity of floods and drought in poyang lake at present the impact of the three gorges project on poyang lake has received widespread attention the three gorges dam intercepts and stores water which has changed the seasonal distribution of runoff in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river xu and milliman 2009 in recent years it has been easy to associate the frequent floods and drought disasters with the construction of the three gorges project zhang et al 2012 however to date there is not enough scientific basis to suggest the correctness of these conjectures the real time dynamic monitoring of the changes in the water surface and wetland ecology of poyang lake is of great significance for the protection of the ecology of the poyang lake area and the maintenance of global biodiversity at present based on remote sensing data some scholars have studied the spatial temporal dynamic changes in the poyang lake water area feng et al 2011 feng et al 2012a b dai et al 2015 zhang et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 and made some progress however due to the influences of the spatial and temporal resolutions of the remote sensing data the remote sensing images collected by the current research institutions are relatively limited and there may be deviations in estimating the seasonal changes in the poyang lake waters over the year simultaneously the selected remote sensing data cover a short period which cannot reflect the characteristics of the long term changes to poyang lake water using long time series and high temporal resolution remote sensing data to accurately extract the water area of poyang lake and analyze its change trend is an important prerequisite for the study of the water environment of poyang lake feng et al 2016 therefore in this study hj 1a b and landsat data from 1989 to 2018 are selected the water area of poyang lake is extracted based on the normalized water index ndwi the water volume information for poyang lake is obtained by the dynamic storage capacity calculation method and the main driving factors and ecological impacts of the water volume changes in poyang lake are analyzed on the one hand the results of this study provide scientific support for the protection of the poyang lake area and on the other hand provide a reference for the protection of similar lakes in other areas 2 data and methods 2 1 study area poyang lake 28 22 29 45 n 115 47 116 45 e is located in northern jiangxi province and on the south bank of the yangtze river fig 1 when the water level at the poyang lake mouth is 21 71 m http www poyanglake net pyhgk htm the average water depth of the whole lake area is 8 4 m and the volume is approximately 27 6 billion m3 the lake drainage area is 162 225 km2 accounting for 97 of the area of jiangxi province area shankman and liang 2003 the lake area is cold in winter and hot in summer with much river runoff the lake receives water from five major rivers in the basin including the ganjiang river fuhe river xinjiang river raohe river and xiushui river and then the lake flows into the yangtze river from the lake mouth after regulation and storage this lake exhibits fluctuating water passage patterns feng et al 2016 affected by the subtropical monsoon climate the regional precipitation shows great seasonality resulting in a great changes in the runoff of the tributaries every year april to september is the rainy season in the lake area and october to march is the dry season guo et al 2012 as an important wetland in the world poyang lake is rich in emergent plants and submerged plants which provide food for migratory birds every year thousands of migratory birds arrive in the area to winter including half of the world s vulnerable species the ecological environment has a widespread influence and has received extensive international attention finlayson et al 2010 feng et al 2012a b 2 2 data with its advantages of long term continuous global coverage moderate temporal and spatial resolution and scientific data archiving and distribution strategy landsat series satellites are among the most effective remote sensing data for the scientific research of surface features and earth systems and are widely used in many fields jiang et al 2013 a total of 299 landsat tm etm oli series images from 1989 to 2018 were obtained from the united states geological survey usgs https www usgs gov with the a 30 m spatial resolution fig 2 in 2008 china successfully launched the small satellite constellation system for environment and disaster monitoring and prediction satellites a and b two sets of wide coverage multispectral visible light cameras ccd with the same parameter settings were installed on satellite a and satellite b the spatial resolution of the hj 1a b data is 30 m and the width of each image is 360 km push scan imaging is carried out for four bands because the number of landsat images is rather small and part of them has poor quality we select the hj 1a b image as a supplement hj 1a b has a similar imaging geometry and the same spatial resolution of 30 m as landsat tm etm oli the visible and near infrared bands are set the same and the spectral response curve is similar hu et al 2014a b which can be used as an effective supplement for water extraction a total of 234 hj a b images from 2008 to 2018 were collected from the china resource satellite application center http www bidprocess com company 321759 html fig 2 then a total of 533 satellite images were preprocessed in envi preprocessing including ozone absorption correction elimination of the rayleigh scattering signal image mosaic and cropping was used on the landsat data the quadratic polynomial model was used to geometrically correct the hj a b image by using landsat images as reference and the geometrically corrected image were subjected to flaash atmospheric correction the meteorological data were downloaded from the china meteorological data service center cmdc http data cma cn which is an authoritative and unified sharing service platform with open meteorological data resources in this study the monthly evaporation and precipitation data from 7 stations around poyang lake from 1989 to 2018 were used fig 1 the shuttle rader topography mission srtm dem data were downloaded from lp daac https lpdaac usgs gov of the u s geological survey usgs the monthly nh3 n concentration of lake water from june 2012 to july 2018 was collected from the china environmental testing center www cnemc cn 2 3 methods 2 3 1 water area extraction due to the drastic changes in the water body of poyang lake a periodic water dissipation area is formed around the lake the changes in vegetation in the water dissipation area lag behind the changes to the water body which would interfere with the determination of the water boundary shankman et al 2006 mcefeeters mcfeeters 1996 proposed ndwi in 1996 based on the concept of ndvi ndwi can partly eliminate the influences of solar altitude angle sensor angle of view and atmospheric condition it was recommended to extract water information and accurately capture the change characteristics of large scale water bodies over a long time series strayer and findlay 2010 yamazaki et al 2015 and the calculation formula is as follows 1 ndwi g r e e n n i r g r e e n n i r where green is the green band of images and nir is the near infrared band the ndwi value of vegetation and soil is significantly lower than that of a water body the threshold values between water and non water were determined and then the water information was extracted based on the landsat and hj 1a b images from 1989 to 2018 2 3 2 water volume estimation the water storage calculation model regards the lake as an irregular geometry with a top and bottom the basic idea is to find a plane that fits the real water surface as best as possible according to the top of the geometry the calculation process is to divide the whole lake water body into massive quadrangular prisms with the same bottom areas and different water column heights in the vertical direction the water column height is the elevation difference hij between the water surface and the lake bottom at a specified dem pixel the volume of the quadrangular prisms is the product of the elevation difference hij and the bottom area s then according to the principle of integration the sum of all quadrangular prisms can be accumulated to obtain the lake water volume v the calculation formula can be described as follows 2 v s h ij d s for the simulated water surface of poyang lake the water boundary line was vertically projected onto the surface of the dem discretized and divided into a line segments with a length of 150 m the midpoint of the line segment was taken and the observation point sequence with a spacing of 150 m was established on the water area boundary after experiments the grid extracted from the dem with a spacing of 150 m was the closest to the water line and two grids will appeared at the same observational point if it is too small however if the grid size is too large the grid elements would be too sparse the elevation of an observation point is the elevation value of the dem grid element the kriging interpolation method was used for the observation point sequence to obtain the simulated elevation surface of the poyang lake water body simultaneously the surface overlaps with the dem at the bottom of the simulated water body to form a closed geometry the volume of the geometry is the water storage of poyang lake 3 results 3 1 temporal and spatial characteristics of the water body 3 1 1 interannual change in water body fig 3 shows the interannual change trend of the water area of poyang lake from 1989 to 2018 the figure shows that the interannual fluctuation in the maximum water area is relatively gentle and the overall trend is decreasing the maximum value of the interannual water area is the highest in 1998 fig 4 and the lowest in 2018 and the ratio between the highest value and the lowest value is 1 32 which is concentrated between 3000 km2 and 4500 km2 the interannual fluctuation in the minimum water area is more severe than the fluctuation maximum water area and the overall trend is decreasing the minimum water area is highest in 1998 and the lowest in 2014 fig 4 the ratio between the highest value and the lowest value is 3 4 which is concentrated between 1000 km2 and 3500 km2 the interannual fluctuation in the average water area is similar to the minimum value but it is more intense than the minimum value and the overall trend is decreasing the average water area is highest in 1998 and the lowest in 2011 the ratio between the highest value and the lowest value is 1 93 which is concentrated between 1500 km2 and 3500 km2 in terms of kurtosis and skewness table 1 the peak steepness of the interannual maximum water area distribution is larger than the normal distribution and exhibies a peak to the left of the peak of a normal distribution the distribution of the minimum water area is also steeper than the normal distribution and exhibits a peak to the right of the peak of the normal distribution this result shows that there are many extreme values on the left side of the interannual change sequence of the maximum water area many extreme values appeared on the right side of the minimum water area sequence fig 5 shows the interannual variation trend of in the water volume of poyang lake the figure shows that the interannual fluctuation in the maximum water volume is relatively gentle and the overall trend is decreasing the interannual maximum water volume is the highest in 1992 the lowest in 2018 and the ratio between the highest value and the lowest value is 1 32 which is concentrated between 21 billion m3 and 24 billion m3 the annual fluctuation in the minimum water quantity is more intense and the overall trend is decreasing the annual minimum water quantity is the highest in 1998 and lowest in 2014 the ratio between the highest value and the lowest value is 3 4 which is concentrated between 7 billion m3 and 10 billion m3 the annual fluctuation of the average water quantity is similar to the minimum value but it is more violent than the minimum value showing an overall decreasing trend the average annual water quantity is the highest in 1998 and lowest in 2011 and the ratio between the highest value and the lowest value is 1 78 which is concentrated between 14 billion m3 and 19 billion m3 in terms of kurtosis and skewness table 2 the distribution of the annual maximum water volume is gentler than the normal distribution and exhibits a left skewed peak and the distribution of the minimum water volume is steeper than that the normal distribution and exhibits a right skewed peak this result shows that there are many extreme values on the left side of the mean in the interannual variation sequence of the maximum water volume and the data on the left side are more discrete than those on the right in the interannual variation sequence of the minimum water volume there are many extreme values on the right side of the mean and the data on the right side are more discrete than those on the left 3 1 2 seasonality changes in water body similarly the seasonality of the water area was analyzed by taking the maximum average and minimum values of the monthly water area from 1998 to 2018 fig 6 shows the maximum minimum and average values of the water surface in each month from january to december a significant seasonality was shown and all three values reached their peaks in july and the lowest in february among them the extreme maximum water area was 4068 33 km2 in july 1998 and the minimum was 899 68 km2 in february 2014 the maximum value average value and minimum value of monthly data from 1998 to 2018 were taken to analyze the monthly variation in water volume in the monthly distribution of the maximum and average water volume these values were highest in july and the lowest in february the minimum water volume was highest in june and the lowest in february the maximum water volume was 25 81 billion m3 in july 1992 and 15 99 billion m3 in february 2003 the minimum water volume was 5 88 billion m3 in june 2011 and 9 14 billion m3 in february 2014 the average water volume was 21 795 billion m3 in july 1998 and 12 249 billion m3 in february 2011 3 1 3 relationship between water area and water volume based on the remote sensing data of poyang lake from 1989 to 2018 the characteristics of the changes in water area and the water volume were monitored the average annual water area of poyang lake was 2357 km2 and the average annual storage of poyang lake was 15 6 billion m3 the correlation analysis of water area and water volume data showed that there was a significant positive correlation between the water area and water volume p 0 01 and the pearson correlation coefficient was 0 991 fig 7 shows the linear relationship between water area and water volume by considering the water area and corresponding water volume as data points the results show that the water area and water volume match well r2 0 9396 and the water area increased by 573 million m3 for every 100 km2 of storage capacity 3 2 ecological impact 3 2 1 water quality nh3 n is an indicator of the ammonia nitrogen content in water wastewater which is a factor that directly affects the eutrophication of rivers and lakes muhamad et al 2013 due to the limitation of data acquisition this study is based on nh3 n concentration data from june 2012 to july 2018 and these data are compared with the water volume change trend to analyze the impact of water volume changes on water quality as shown in fig 8 the highest nh3 n concentration period occurred in january 2014 and the lowest concentration period occurred in june 2014 the concentration of nh3 n changed dramatically during the three periods from november 2013 to april 2014 december 2014 to june 2015 and november 2016 to july 2018 and the concentration was relatively high gentle fluctuations occured in the rest of the period and the concentration content was relatively low the maximum period of water volume occured in june 2012 and the minimum period occured in february 2014 the curve of the water volume and nh3 n concentration shows the characteristics of this change the correlation analysis between the collected nh3 n data and the corresponding water volume data showed that there was a significant negative correlation between the water volume and the nh3 n concentration p 0 01 and the pearson correlation coefficient was 0 679 the collected nh3 n concentration and water volume data from june 2012 to july 2018 are averaged monthly to study the seasonality fig 9 shows that the concentration of nh3 n was the lowest in june at 0 17 mg l and highest in january at 0 50 mg l concentration of nh3 n obviously decreased from january to june slightly fluctuated and increased from june to october and obviously increased from october to january during the study period the fluctuation in water volume was smaller than that of the nh3 n concentration the water volume reached a maximum in july at 20 603 billion m3 and a minimum in january at 9 211 billion m3 the water volume showed an obvious upward trend from january to june a slow downward trend from june to september and a significant downward trend from september to january 3 2 2 migratory bird habitats the water level is the main factor that affects changes to migratory birds habitats the high water level during the wet season affects the development of beach vegetation and the growth of submerged vegetation during this period the food for wintering migratory birds is insufficient the quantity of migratory birds is reduced a high water level in the dry season will make it more difficult for migratory birds to feed which will have some adverse effects on their wintering habits hu et al 2014a b therefore maintaining a high water level is not conducive to the protection of wintering habitats migratory birds that overwintering in poyang lake begin to arrive one after another in october and leave in april of the following year in this study the minimum water area february 2014 in the study period was taken as the base water area for the calculation of migratory bird habitate in the winter the maximum and minimum water area of each cycle from october to april as taken as the water level in the wet season and dry season respectively the base water area from the water area during the wet season and the dry season the smaller the difference is the lower the water level is the two differences are superimposed and the smaller the sum is the larger the bird wintering habitat area is as shown in fig 10 because many data were missing before 1999 1999 2018 was taken as the research period to obtain the annual changes in the wintering area of migratory birds fig 11 the figure shows the difference between the dry season and minimum water area where the minimum year is 2014 and the maximum year is 2001 the difference between the wet season and the minimum water area is also shown where the minimum year is 2011 and the maximum year is 2000 the year with the total minimum difference is 2011 and the year with the maximum difference is 2000 in the fluctuation trend the sum of the differences shows a trend of first decreasing and then fluctuating upward with an overall decreasing trend shown p 0 1 the habitat area of migratory birds shows an increasing trend from 1999 to 2009 p 0 05 with a decreasing trend from 2009 to 2018 4 analysis and discussion 4 1 discussion of the factors that influence water body changes the changes in the water body are mainly affected by climate conditions artificial regulation and storage and other factors the water area of the lake is mainly affected by precipitation in the basin and the process of water evaporation will also cause changes in lake water area the difference between precipitation and evaporation is the amount of water entering the lake therefore precipitation and evaporation are the main climate factors affecting the change in the lake area on the other hand the three gorges project started to impound water in 2003 this water storage has an impact on the water environment in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river as well as on the hydrological spatial temporal pattern of poyang lake including the lake area and the start time of the dry season thus the three gorges dam is also an important human factor that leads to changes in the lake water surface 4 1 1 climatic factors poyang lake is located in the northern subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation of 1791 2 mm in 1989 2018 the maximum annual precipitation in 2012 was 2299 3 mm and the minimum precipitation in 2007 was 1169 7 mm on the annual scale the correlation between precipitation and water area was nonsignificant p 0 05 and the pearson correlation coefficient was 0 283 due to the influence of the subtropical monsoon climate the precipitation in the poyang lake area shows great seasonality on the monthly scale the precipitation and water area show a significant positive correlation p 0 05 and the pearson correlation coefficient is 0 603 fig 12 shows the trends in monthly precipitation evaporation and water volume the maximum precipitation value appears in june and the minimum value appears in december the maximum evaporation value appears in july and the minimum value appears in january january and june are the months with water surpluses and july and december are the months of water losses the amount of water increased from january to july but decreased from july to september the strong water decrease from april to june led to an increase in the amount of water the highest amount of water in july may be related to the backflow of the yangtze river the range of the lake water surface is determined by the amount of water entering and leaving the lake from july to september of each year due to the high water level of the yangtze river the water flow rapidly slows and even the backflow of the yangtze river occurs which makes the flow velocity of the lake appear negative shankman et al 2006 therefore the water volume of poyang lake is affected by precipitation in the basin and the water regime of the yangtze river li and xu 2017 4 1 2 three gorges dam the total length of the three gorges dam crest is 3035 m the elevation of the dam crest is 185 m the normal water level is 175 m and the total storage capacity is 39 3 billion m3 in june 2003 the three gorges dam officially began to retain water at that time the storage capacity was 1x 1010 m3 which made the water level in the lower reaches of the yangtze river drop sharply many scholars have shown that the water area and hydrological conditions of poyang lake have changed significantly since the three gorges dam began intercepting water lv et al 2018 liu et al 2013 taking 2003 as the time cut off point in this study it was found that on the annual scale the annual average water area of poyang lake in 2003 and before was 2638 4 km2 and the annual average water volume was 17 5 billion m3 the annual average water area in 2003 and after was 2300 5 km2 and the average water volume was 15 21 billion m3 after 2003 the water area and water volume in poyang lake showed decreasing trends although the change in other factors such as precipitation may also cause similar changes in the lake the annual precipitation in the poyang lake basin showed no obvious trend change after 2003 therefore the decreasing trend of water area is not caused by interannual changes in precipitation notably yang et al 2006 found that construction of the three gorges project mainly changed the annual distribution of runoff in the yangtze river on a monthly scale the monthly water volume after 2004 decreased compared with that before where november showed the largest difference the monthly average water volume after construction was 5 17 billion m3 less than the volume before that time 2 39 billion m3 less during wet season 2 59 billion m3 less during dry season and the dry season is beginning earlier each year may june is the main flood season in poyang lake the water inputs from the five rivers also increased at this time the increase in discharge of the three gorges reservoir before the flood season resulted in an increase in the critical water level for lake regulation and storage and a decrease in discharge which brought more pressure to the flood control of the lake area in september the water level of the lake area drops decrease when the poyang lake basin entered the recession period at this time the impoundment of the three gorges reservoir after the flood season resulted in a decrease in the critical water level for the lake regulation and storage and an increase in discharge which led to the continued low water period and over time these change may result in adverse effects on the water ecology and water environment in the lake area fan et al 2009 4 2 ecological impact the low flow of poyang lake not only hinders the sustainable development of the social economy to a certain extent and affects the lives production water supply and shipping around the lake but may also have a certain adverse impact on the ecological environment huang et al 2017 on the other hand these changes reduce the living space for fish in the lake area and affect the safety of fish in winter simultaneously the early dry season in poyang lake can lead to an early emergence of wetland beaches affect the normal growth of wetland vegetation reduce the area for migratory birds and thus have adverse effects on wetland ecosystems and biodiversity there is a significant negative correlation between the changes in water quantity and the change in water quality in poyang lake ammonia nitrogen mainly comes from human and animal excreta and is affected by dissolved oxygen and temperature ammonia nitrogen is usually produced by the decomposition of nitrogen containing organic matter when oxygen is insufficient the water body of poyang lake exhibies fast flow the wind speed in the lake area is high the atmospheric reoxygenation is strong the dissolved oxygen and temperature have good coordination and the amount of dissolved oxygen is controlled by temperature generally there is a strong positive correlation between the dissolved oxygen and water temperature in free open shallow water poyang lake generally enters the flood season in april and april to june is also the main time for the five rivers to enter the lake which makes the water level rise from july to september the water inflow of the five rivers decreases and the yangtze river enteres the main flood season at this time the water level of poyang lake is blocked by the impact of the yangtze river flood or backflow and is maintained at a high water level for a long time although the temperature is high and the dissolved oxygen is low at this time a high water level is maintained for a long time and the water volume of the whole lake is large so the water quality is relatively good the increase in water quantity can reduce the concentration of total phosphorus to a certain extent li 2015 after october the water level of poyang lake decreases the beaches are exposed the water flow is channeled and only a few winding waterways are left on the surface of the lake although the temperature is low and the dissolved oxygen is high during this period the volume of poyang lake is small so the overall water quality is poor 4 2 1 impact on the wintering of migratory birds the water level is the main factor affecting the habitat area of migratory birds in the early stage of migration the water level is high and grass island which is suitable for feeding birds has not yet been exposed providing a small habitat area in the dry season the water level is low and grass islets for birds to forage and mud flat depressions rich in fish and shrimp appear which can provide a large habitat area at this time there are many migratory birds with the increase in water level the total area of the wintering habitat will shrink which will affect the composition of the wintering habitat with increasing water levels the fragmentation and connectivity of wintering habitat landscapes will increase and decrease qi et al 2014 a large amount of water will lead to a rising water level which is not conducive to the protection of migratory bird habitats the relatively low water level is conducive to the protection of the habitat range of overwintering migratory birds in the poyang lake wetlands but the hydrological drought in autumn and winter is not conducive to the protection of overwintering migratory birds drought mainly affects the number of migratory birds by destroying wetland systems hindering the growth of wetland plants reducing the food source for birds and reducing the number of migratory birds if the drought period in poyang lake during autumn and winter becomes a normal phenomenon this will lead to the succession of wetland plants in poyang lake becoming terrestrial plants thus causing the overall shrinkage of the poyang lake wetland qi et al 2014 5 summary the water index method has the advantages of being a simple method that is less time consuming than other methods and it has become a common method of water information extraction in the research by zhu et al 2019 ndvi ndwi and modified ndvi mndvi were selected to extract the water information of poyang lake bosten lake and alakol lake respectively and the extraction precision of different indexes was compared the results showed that the extraction accuracy of ndwi in these areas was relatively high therefore in this study the ndwi was selected to extract water extraction information the index can restrain vegetation information to the greatest extent highlight water information and effectively distinguish water from vegetation and mountain shadow but the impact of soil building and shadow will be ignored different background information has different influences on the accuracy of water extraction the use of only a single water index may have some impact on the results and more accurate water information extraction methods will be evaluated in a follow up study based on spatial information technology remote sensing and dem data and the ndwi the water area of poyang lake is extracted the water volume information is estimated with the dynamic storage capacity method the long term dynamic change in the water volume of poyang lake is studied from 1989 to 2018 and the driving factors and ecological impacts are analyzed the results are as follows 1 during 1989 2018 the largest water area of 4068 km2 appeared in 1998 and the smallest water area of 899 68 km2 appeared in 2014 showing an overall downward trend among the monthly changes the average water area was smallest in january and largest in july showing an increasing trend from january to july and a decreasing trend from august to january 2 during 1989 2018 the maximum water volume was 25 81 billion m3 in 1992 and the minimum water volume was 9 14 billion m3 in 2014 showing an overall decreasing trend in terms of the monthly changes the average water volume was smallest in january and largest in july with the water volume increasing from february to july and decreasing from august to february there was a significant correlation between the water area and water volume of poyang lake p 0 01 and the correlation coefficient was 0 991 for every 100 km2 of water area there were the storage capacity increased by 573 million m3 3 the water volume of poyang lake is mainly affected by natural and human factors the obvious seasonal changes in the precipitation in the poyang lake area and the influence of the yangtze river water regime mean that the quantity of the water in the poyang lake area shows seasonal changes in addition the construction of the three gorges project on the yangtze river will cause problems such as the extension of the duration of the dry season and the advancement of the dry season which will also bring a series of impacts to the wetland ecological environment 4 the relationship between the change in water volume and nh3 n concentration in poyang lake is obvious the relationship between the water quantity and nh3 n concentration data is significantly negative p 0 01 the pearson correlation coefficient is 0 679 and the increase in the water volume can reduce the concentration of pollutants in the lake area to a certain extent the increase in water volume will lead to a high lake water level while the higher water level will lead to a reduction in migratory bird habitat area which will have a negative impact on migratory bird habitats credit authorship contribution statement hai liu formal analysis methodology validation writing review editing liang zheng formal

5250,with global warming and aggravation due to human activities many lakes on earth are facing a series of worsening environmental problems such as shrinking areas and declining water quality poyang lake is the largest freshwater lake in china an important wetland in the world and the largest migratory bird habitat in asia the ecological environment of the lake has a widespread influence and has attracted international attention it is necessary to use long term frequent satellite observations to investigate the poyang lake due to its high frequency fluctuations characteristics however most remote sensing data cover only a short period of time which cannot reflect the long term change to the poyang lake water no satellite mission currently fits such requirements based on hj 1a b and landsat data from 1989 to 2018 the dynamic changes in water quantity in poyang lake are monitored in this paper and the influencing factors and ecological impacts of the changes are analyzed the results show that in terms of the water area change trend on the annual scale the annual mean values of water area and water volume exhibit overall decreasing trends the water area was the largest in 1998 at 4068 33 km2 and smallest in 2014 at 899 68 km2 the water volume was largest in 1992 at 25 810 million m3 and smallest in 2014 at 5880 million m3 on the monthly scale the water area was the smallest in january largest in july and showed an increasing trend from january to july subsequently a decreasing trend was observed from august to january the water volume was smallest in february largest in july and showed an increasing trend from february to july then a decreasing trend was observed from august to february the water volume of poyang lake is affected by seasonal changes in precipitation and the correlation coefficient between monthly precipitation and monthly water volume is 0 603 p 0 05 in summer the water volume is affected by the water level in the yangtze river the construction of the three gorges dam in the yangtze river caused a prolonged duration of the low water period and an advanced low water period which are also important factors affecting the water volume change in terms of the impact of water volume on ecology the relationship between water volume and nh3 n concentration is obvious with a correlation coefficient of 0 679 p 0 01 a large water volume will increase the lake water level reduce the habitats for migratory birds and provide food to fewer migratory birds keywords dense long time series data poyang lake dynamic changes influencing factors ecological impact 1 introduction lakes act as fulcra of the interactions among the spheres of the earth s surface system and are an important part of the terrestrial hydrosphere lakes are closely related to the biosphere atmosphere lithosphere and so on lakes have special functions in regulating the regional climate recording regional environmental changes maintaining regional ecosystem balance and increasing biodiversity with global warming and aggravation due to human activities inland water bodies especially lakes are facing a series of worsening problems such as reductions in area and declining water quality such as eutrophication which seriously threaten the normal ecological functions of lakes bryant 2009 bianduo et al 2009 hinkel et al 2007 smith et al 2005 in the past few decades many lakes throughout the world have changed in terms of size shape and ecology awange et al 2008 george et al 2007 stevenson et al 2010 monitoring lake water body changes is related not only to the sustainable development of the lake basin but also to the sustainable development of the regional ecological economy the changes in a water body are affected by climate conditions artificial regulation and storage and other factors the characteristics of short term continuous fluctuations are obvious single date images cannot reflect the dynamic changes in a water body long term dynamic monitoring is the main direction of the current water body research muala et al 2014 song et al 2013 the methods for the research on water dynamic changes are mainly divided into traditional hydrological solution algorithms and spatial information technology simulations traditional hydrological solution methods guirguis et al 1996 crétaux et al 2005 medina et al 2010 can be used to obtain accurate water storage data however the accuracy is related to the quality of the bathymetry data the disadvantage of this method is that the acquisition of terrain data requires considerable manpower and material resources the emergence of space information technology especially remote sensing makes it possible to continuously observe the earth in a wide ranging multiphase and low cost way a water body has characteristically low reflectivity in the visible which makes water bodies easy to extract remote sensing technology has gradually become an important means of monitoring which has been widely used in inland lakes and coastal water change monitoring ma et al 2010 muala et al 2014 as the largest freshwater lake in china poyang lake experiences a very significant seasonal change in lake area the seasonal alteration of water and land provides good conditions for the development of wetland ecosystems along the marshland lakeshores every year thousands of migratory birds move to this area to winter this lake is a wetland of international importance and the largest migratory bird habitat in asia shankman and liang 2003 xiong and li 2002 the ecological environment of this lake has a wide range of effects and is the focus of international concern the fluctuation in water level is the main factor affecting the lake wetland ecosystem nõges and nõges 1999 under the influence of the monsoon climate the seasonal change in precipitation in the poyang lake area is very significant which increases the dynamic changes in the lake water area larger at the same time due to the complex hydrological conditions the area surrounding poyang lake has always experienced some of the most serious flood and drought disasters in china in recent years the frequency and intensity of disasters have increased significantly in addition to natural factors human factors also directly or indirectly affect the frequency and severity of floods and drought in poyang lake at present the impact of the three gorges project on poyang lake has received widespread attention the three gorges dam intercepts and stores water which has changed the seasonal distribution of runoff in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river xu and milliman 2009 in recent years it has been easy to associate the frequent floods and drought disasters with the construction of the three gorges project zhang et al 2012 however to date there is not enough scientific basis to suggest the correctness of these conjectures the real time dynamic monitoring of the changes in the water surface and wetland ecology of poyang lake is of great significance for the protection of the ecology of the poyang lake area and the maintenance of global biodiversity at present based on remote sensing data some scholars have studied the spatial temporal dynamic changes in the poyang lake water area feng et al 2011 feng et al 2012a b dai et al 2015 zhang et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 and made some progress however due to the influences of the spatial and temporal resolutions of the remote sensing data the remote sensing images collected by the current research institutions are relatively limited and there may be deviations in estimating the seasonal changes in the poyang lake waters over the year simultaneously the selected remote sensing data cover a short period which cannot reflect the characteristics of the long term changes to poyang lake water using long time series and high temporal resolution remote sensing data to accurately extract the water area of poyang lake and analyze its change trend is an important prerequisite for the study of the water environment of poyang lake feng et al 2016 therefore in this study hj 1a b and landsat data from 1989 to 2018 are selected the water area of poyang lake is extracted based on the normalized water index ndwi the water volume information for poyang lake is obtained by the dynamic storage capacity calculation method and the main driving factors and ecological impacts of the water volume changes in poyang lake are analyzed on the one hand the results of this study provide scientific support for the protection of the poyang lake area and on the other hand provide a reference for the protection of similar lakes in other areas 2 data and methods 2 1 study area poyang lake 28 22 29 45 n 115 47 116 45 e is located in northern jiangxi province and on the south bank of the yangtze river fig 1 when the water level at the poyang lake mouth is 21 71 m http www poyanglake net pyhgk htm the average water depth of the whole lake area is 8 4 m and the volume is approximately 27 6 billion m3 the lake drainage area is 162 225 km2 accounting for 97 of the area of jiangxi province area shankman and liang 2003 the lake area is cold in winter and hot in summer with much river runoff the lake receives water from five major rivers in the basin including the ganjiang river fuhe river xinjiang river raohe river and xiushui river and then the lake flows into the yangtze river from the lake mouth after regulation and storage this lake exhibits fluctuating water passage patterns feng et al 2016 affected by the subtropical monsoon climate the regional precipitation shows great seasonality resulting in a great changes in the runoff of the tributaries every year april to september is the rainy season in the lake area and october to march is the dry season guo et al 2012 as an important wetland in the world poyang lake is rich in emergent plants and submerged plants which provide food for migratory birds every year thousands of migratory birds arrive in the area to winter including half of the world s vulnerable species the ecological environment has a widespread influence and has received extensive international attention finlayson et al 2010 feng et al 2012a b 2 2 data with its advantages of long term continuous global coverage moderate temporal and spatial resolution and scientific data archiving and distribution strategy landsat series satellites are among the most effective remote sensing data for the scientific research of surface features and earth systems and are widely used in many fields jiang et al 2013 a total of 299 landsat tm etm oli series images from 1989 to 2018 were obtained from the united states geological survey usgs https www usgs gov with the a 30 m spatial resolution fig 2 in 2008 china successfully launched the small satellite constellation system for environment and disaster monitoring and prediction satellites a and b two sets of wide coverage multispectral visible light cameras ccd with the same parameter settings were installed on satellite a and satellite b the spatial resolution of the hj 1a b data is 30 m and the width of each image is 360 km push scan imaging is carried out for four bands because the number of landsat images is rather small and part of them has poor quality we select the hj 1a b image as a supplement hj 1a b has a similar imaging geometry and the same spatial resolution of 30 m as landsat tm etm oli the visible and near infrared bands are set the same and the spectral response curve is similar hu et al 2014a b which can be used as an effective supplement for water extraction a total of 234 hj a b images from 2008 to 2018 were collected from the china resource satellite application center http www bidprocess com company 321759 html fig 2 then a total of 533 satellite images were preprocessed in envi preprocessing including ozone absorption correction elimination of the rayleigh scattering signal image mosaic and cropping was used on the landsat data the quadratic polynomial model was used to geometrically correct the hj a b image by using landsat images as reference and the geometrically corrected image were subjected to flaash atmospheric correction the meteorological data were downloaded from the china meteorological data service center cmdc http data cma cn which is an authoritative and unified sharing service platform with open meteorological data resources in this study the monthly evaporation and precipitation data from 7 stations around poyang lake from 1989 to 2018 were used fig 1 the shuttle rader topography mission srtm dem data were downloaded from lp daac https lpdaac usgs gov of the u s geological survey usgs the monthly nh3 n concentration of lake water from june 2012 to july 2018 was collected from the china environmental testing center www cnemc cn 2 3 methods 2 3 1 water area extraction due to the drastic changes in the water body of poyang lake a periodic water dissipation area is formed around the lake the changes in vegetation in the water dissipation area lag behind the changes to the water body which would interfere with the determination of the water boundary shankman et al 2006 mcefeeters mcfeeters 1996 proposed ndwi in 1996 based on the concept of ndvi ndwi can partly eliminate the influences of solar altitude angle sensor angle of view and atmospheric condition it was recommended to extract water information and accurately capture the change characteristics of large scale water bodies over a long time series strayer and findlay 2010 yamazaki et al 2015 and the calculation formula is as follows 1 ndwi g r e e n n i r g r e e n n i r where green is the green band of images and nir is the near infrared band the ndwi value of vegetation and soil is significantly lower than that of a water body the threshold values between water and non water were determined and then the water information was extracted based on the landsat and hj 1a b images from 1989 to 2018 2 3 2 water volume estimation the water storage calculation model regards the lake as an irregular geometry with a top and bottom the basic idea is to find a plane that fits the real water surface as best as possible according to the top of the geometry the calculation process is to divide the whole lake water body into massive quadrangular prisms with the same bottom areas and different water column heights in the vertical direction the water column height is the elevation difference hij between the water surface and the lake bottom at a specified dem pixel the volume of the quadrangular prisms is the product of the elevation difference hij and the bottom area s then according to the principle of integration the sum of all quadrangular prisms can be accumulated to obtain the lake water volume v the calculation formula can be described as follows 2 v s h ij d s for the simulated water surface of poyang lake the water boundary line was vertically projected onto the surface of the dem discretized and divided into a line segments with a length of 150 m the midpoint of the line segment was taken and the observation point sequence with a spacing of 150 m was established on the water area boundary after experiments the grid extracted from the dem with a spacing of 150 m was the closest to the water line and two grids will appeared at the same observational point if it is too small however if the grid size is too large the grid elements would be too sparse the elevation of an observation point is the elevation value of the dem grid element the kriging interpolation method was used for the observation point sequence to obtain the simulated elevation surface of the poyang lake water body simultaneously the surface overlaps with the dem at the bottom of the simulated water body to form a closed geometry the volume of the geometry is the water storage of poyang lake 3 results 3 1 temporal and spatial characteristics of the water body 3 1 1 interannual change in water body fig 3 shows the interannual change trend of the water area of poyang lake from 1989 to 2018 the figure shows that the interannual fluctuation in the maximum water area is relatively gentle and the overall trend is decreasing the maximum value of the interannual water area is the highest in 1998 fig 4 and the lowest in 2018 and the ratio between the highest value and the lowest value is 1 32 which is concentrated between 3000 km2 and 4500 km2 the interannual fluctuation in the minimum water area is more severe than the fluctuation maximum water area and the overall trend is decreasing the minimum water area is highest in 1998 and the lowest in 2014 fig 4 the ratio between the highest value and the lowest value is 3 4 which is concentrated between 1000 km2 and 3500 km2 the interannual fluctuation in the average water area is similar to the minimum value but it is more intense than the minimum value and the overall trend is decreasing the average water area is highest in 1998 and the lowest in 2011 the ratio between the highest value and the lowest value is 1 93 which is concentrated between 1500 km2 and 3500 km2 in terms of kurtosis and skewness table 1 the peak steepness of the interannual maximum water area distribution is larger than the normal distribution and exhibies a peak to the left of the peak of a normal distribution the distribution of the minimum water area is also steeper than the normal distribution and exhibits a peak to the right of the peak of the normal distribution this result shows that there are many extreme values on the left side of the interannual change sequence of the maximum water area many extreme values appeared on the right side of the minimum water area sequence fig 5 shows the interannual variation trend of in the water volume of poyang lake the figure shows that the interannual fluctuation in the maximum water volume is relatively gentle and the overall trend is decreasing the interannual maximum water volume is the highest in 1992 the lowest in 2018 and the ratio between the highest value and the lowest value is 1 32 which is concentrated between 21 billion m3 and 24 billion m3 the annual fluctuation in the minimum water quantity is more intense and the overall trend is decreasing the annual minimum water quantity is the highest in 1998 and lowest in 2014 the ratio between the highest value and the lowest value is 3 4 which is concentrated between 7 billion m3 and 10 billion m3 the annual fluctuation of the average water quantity is similar to the minimum value but it is more violent than the minimum value showing an overall decreasing trend the average annual water quantity is the highest in 1998 and lowest in 2011 and the ratio between the highest value and the lowest value is 1 78 which is concentrated between 14 billion m3 and 19 billion m3 in terms of kurtosis and skewness table 2 the distribution of the annual maximum water volume is gentler than the normal distribution and exhibits a left skewed peak and the distribution of the minimum water volume is steeper than that the normal distribution and exhibits a right skewed peak this result shows that there are many extreme values on the left side of the mean in the interannual variation sequence of the maximum water volume and the data on the left side are more discrete than those on the right in the interannual variation sequence of the minimum water volume there are many extreme values on the right side of the mean and the data on the right side are more discrete than those on the left 3 1 2 seasonality changes in water body similarly the seasonality of the water area was analyzed by taking the maximum average and minimum values of the monthly water area from 1998 to 2018 fig 6 shows the maximum minimum and average values of the water surface in each month from january to december a significant seasonality was shown and all three values reached their peaks in july and the lowest in february among them the extreme maximum water area was 4068 33 km2 in july 1998 and the minimum was 899 68 km2 in february 2014 the maximum value average value and minimum value of monthly data from 1998 to 2018 were taken to analyze the monthly variation in water volume in the monthly distribution of the maximum and average water volume these values were highest in july and the lowest in february the minimum water volume was highest in june and the lowest in february the maximum water volume was 25 81 billion m3 in july 1992 and 15 99 billion m3 in february 2003 the minimum water volume was 5 88 billion m3 in june 2011 and 9 14 billion m3 in february 2014 the average water volume was 21 795 billion m3 in july 1998 and 12 249 billion m3 in february 2011 3 1 3 relationship between water area and water volume based on the remote sensing data of poyang lake from 1989 to 2018 the characteristics of the changes in water area and the water volume were monitored the average annual water area of poyang lake was 2357 km2 and the average annual storage of poyang lake was 15 6 billion m3 the correlation analysis of water area and water volume data showed that there was a significant positive correlation between the water area and water volume p 0 01 and the pearson correlation coefficient was 0 991 fig 7 shows the linear relationship between water area and water volume by considering the water area and corresponding water volume as data points the results show that the water area and water volume match well r2 0 9396 and the water area increased by 573 million m3 for every 100 km2 of storage capacity 3 2 ecological impact 3 2 1 water quality nh3 n is an indicator of the ammonia nitrogen content in water wastewater which is a factor that directly affects the eutrophication of rivers and lakes muhamad et al 2013 due to the limitation of data acquisition this study is based on nh3 n concentration data from june 2012 to july 2018 and these data are compared with the water volume change trend to analyze the impact of water volume changes on water quality as shown in fig 8 the highest nh3 n concentration period occurred in january 2014 and the lowest concentration period occurred in june 2014 the concentration of nh3 n changed dramatically during the three periods from november 2013 to april 2014 december 2014 to june 2015 and november 2016 to july 2018 and the concentration was relatively high gentle fluctuations occured in the rest of the period and the concentration content was relatively low the maximum period of water volume occured in june 2012 and the minimum period occured in february 2014 the curve of the water volume and nh3 n concentration shows the characteristics of this change the correlation analysis between the collected nh3 n data and the corresponding water volume data showed that there was a significant negative correlation between the water volume and the nh3 n concentration p 0 01 and the pearson correlation coefficient was 0 679 the collected nh3 n concentration and water volume data from june 2012 to july 2018 are averaged monthly to study the seasonality fig 9 shows that the concentration of nh3 n was the lowest in june at 0 17 mg l and highest in january at 0 50 mg l concentration of nh3 n obviously decreased from january to june slightly fluctuated and increased from june to october and obviously increased from october to january during the study period the fluctuation in water volume was smaller than that of the nh3 n concentration the water volume reached a maximum in july at 20 603 billion m3 and a minimum in january at 9 211 billion m3 the water volume showed an obvious upward trend from january to june a slow downward trend from june to september and a significant downward trend from september to january 3 2 2 migratory bird habitats the water level is the main factor that affects changes to migratory birds habitats the high water level during the wet season affects the development of beach vegetation and the growth of submerged vegetation during this period the food for wintering migratory birds is insufficient the quantity of migratory birds is reduced a high water level in the dry season will make it more difficult for migratory birds to feed which will have some adverse effects on their wintering habits hu et al 2014a b therefore maintaining a high water level is not conducive to the protection of wintering habitats migratory birds that overwintering in poyang lake begin to arrive one after another in october and leave in april of the following year in this study the minimum water area february 2014 in the study period was taken as the base water area for the calculation of migratory bird habitate in the winter the maximum and minimum water area of each cycle from october to april as taken as the water level in the wet season and dry season respectively the base water area from the water area during the wet season and the dry season the smaller the difference is the lower the water level is the two differences are superimposed and the smaller the sum is the larger the bird wintering habitat area is as shown in fig 10 because many data were missing before 1999 1999 2018 was taken as the research period to obtain the annual changes in the wintering area of migratory birds fig 11 the figure shows the difference between the dry season and minimum water area where the minimum year is 2014 and the maximum year is 2001 the difference between the wet season and the minimum water area is also shown where the minimum year is 2011 and the maximum year is 2000 the year with the total minimum difference is 2011 and the year with the maximum difference is 2000 in the fluctuation trend the sum of the differences shows a trend of first decreasing and then fluctuating upward with an overall decreasing trend shown p 0 1 the habitat area of migratory birds shows an increasing trend from 1999 to 2009 p 0 05 with a decreasing trend from 2009 to 2018 4 analysis and discussion 4 1 discussion of the factors that influence water body changes the changes in the water body are mainly affected by climate conditions artificial regulation and storage and other factors the water area of the lake is mainly affected by precipitation in the basin and the process of water evaporation will also cause changes in lake water area the difference between precipitation and evaporation is the amount of water entering the lake therefore precipitation and evaporation are the main climate factors affecting the change in the lake area on the other hand the three gorges project started to impound water in 2003 this water storage has an impact on the water environment in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river as well as on the hydrological spatial temporal pattern of poyang lake including the lake area and the start time of the dry season thus the three gorges dam is also an important human factor that leads to changes in the lake water surface 4 1 1 climatic factors poyang lake is located in the northern subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation of 1791 2 mm in 1989 2018 the maximum annual precipitation in 2012 was 2299 3 mm and the minimum precipitation in 2007 was 1169 7 mm on the annual scale the correlation between precipitation and water area was nonsignificant p 0 05 and the pearson correlation coefficient was 0 283 due to the influence of the subtropical monsoon climate the precipitation in the poyang lake area shows great seasonality on the monthly scale the precipitation and water area show a significant positive correlation p 0 05 and the pearson correlation coefficient is 0 603 fig 12 shows the trends in monthly precipitation evaporation and water volume the maximum precipitation value appears in june and the minimum value appears in december the maximum evaporation value appears in july and the minimum value appears in january january and june are the months with water surpluses and july and december are the months of water losses the amount of water increased from january to july but decreased from july to september the strong water decrease from april to june led to an increase in the amount of water the highest amount of water in july may be related to the backflow of the yangtze river the range of the lake water surface is determined by the amount of water entering and leaving the lake from july to september of each year due to the high water level of the yangtze river the water flow rapidly slows and even the backflow of the yangtze river occurs which makes the flow velocity of the lake appear negative shankman et al 2006 therefore the water volume of poyang lake is affected by precipitation in the basin and the water regime of the yangtze river li and xu 2017 4 1 2 three gorges dam the total length of the three gorges dam crest is 3035 m the elevation of the dam crest is 185 m the normal water level is 175 m and the total storage capacity is 39 3 billion m3 in june 2003 the three gorges dam officially began to retain water at that time the storage capacity was 1x 1010 m3 which made the water level in the lower reaches of the yangtze river drop sharply many scholars have shown that the water area and hydrological conditions of poyang lake have changed significantly since the three gorges dam began intercepting water lv et al 2018 liu et al 2013 taking 2003 as the time cut off point in this study it was found that on the annual scale the annual average water area of poyang lake in 2003 and before was 2638 4 km2 and the annual average water volume was 17 5 billion m3 the annual average water area in 2003 and after was 2300 5 km2 and the average water volume was 15 21 billion m3 after 2003 the water area and water volume in poyang lake showed decreasing trends although the change in other factors such as precipitation may also cause similar changes in the lake the annual precipitation in the poyang lake basin showed no obvious trend change after 2003 therefore the decreasing trend of water area is not caused by interannual changes in precipitation notably yang et al 2006 found that construction of the three gorges project mainly changed the annual distribution of runoff in the yangtze river on a monthly scale the monthly water volume after 2004 decreased compared with that before where november showed the largest difference the monthly average water volume after construction was 5 17 billion m3 less than the volume before that time 2 39 billion m3 less during wet season 2 59 billion m3 less during dry season and the dry season is beginning earlier each year may june is the main flood season in poyang lake the water inputs from the five rivers also increased at this time the increase in discharge of the three gorges reservoir before the flood season resulted in an increase in the critical water level for lake regulation and storage and a decrease in discharge which brought more pressure to the flood control of the lake area in september the water level of the lake area drops decrease when the poyang lake basin entered the recession period at this time the impoundment of the three gorges reservoir after the flood season resulted in a decrease in the critical water level for the lake regulation and storage and an increase in discharge which led to the continued low water period and over time these change may result in adverse effects on the water ecology and water environment in the lake area fan et al 2009 4 2 ecological impact the low flow of poyang lake not only hinders the sustainable development of the social economy to a certain extent and affects the lives production water supply and shipping around the lake but may also have a certain adverse impact on the ecological environment huang et al 2017 on the other hand these changes reduce the living space for fish in the lake area and affect the safety of fish in winter simultaneously the early dry season in poyang lake can lead to an early emergence of wetland beaches affect the normal growth of wetland vegetation reduce the area for migratory birds and thus have adverse effects on wetland ecosystems and biodiversity there is a significant negative correlation between the changes in water quantity and the change in water quality in poyang lake ammonia nitrogen mainly comes from human and animal excreta and is affected by dissolved oxygen and temperature ammonia nitrogen is usually produced by the decomposition of nitrogen containing organic matter when oxygen is insufficient the water body of poyang lake exhibies fast flow the wind speed in the lake area is high the atmospheric reoxygenation is strong the dissolved oxygen and temperature have good coordination and the amount of dissolved oxygen is controlled by temperature generally there is a strong positive correlation between the dissolved oxygen and water temperature in free open shallow water poyang lake generally enters the flood season in april and april to june is also the main time for the five rivers to enter the lake which makes the water level rise from july to september the water inflow of the five rivers decreases and the yangtze river enteres the main flood season at this time the water level of poyang lake is blocked by the impact of the yangtze river flood or backflow and is maintained at a high water level for a long time although the temperature is high and the dissolved oxygen is low at this time a high water level is maintained for a long time and the water volume of the whole lake is large so the water quality is relatively good the increase in water quantity can reduce the concentration of total phosphorus to a certain extent li 2015 after october the water level of poyang lake decreases the beaches are exposed the water flow is channeled and only a few winding waterways are left on the surface of the lake although the temperature is low and the dissolved oxygen is high during this period the volume of poyang lake is small so the overall water quality is poor 4 2 1 impact on the wintering of migratory birds the water level is the main factor affecting the habitat area of migratory birds in the early stage of migration the water level is high and grass island which is suitable for feeding birds has not yet been exposed providing a small habitat area in the dry season the water level is low and grass islets for birds to forage and mud flat depressions rich in fish and shrimp appear which can provide a large habitat area at this time there are many migratory birds with the increase in water level the total area of the wintering habitat will shrink which will affect the composition of the wintering habitat with increasing water levels the fragmentation and connectivity of wintering habitat landscapes will increase and decrease qi et al 2014 a large amount of water will lead to a rising water level which is not conducive to the protection of migratory bird habitats the relatively low water level is conducive to the protection of the habitat range of overwintering migratory birds in the poyang lake wetlands but the hydrological drought in autumn and winter is not conducive to the protection of overwintering migratory birds drought mainly affects the number of migratory birds by destroying wetland systems hindering the growth of wetland plants reducing the food source for birds and reducing the number of migratory birds if the drought period in poyang lake during autumn and winter becomes a normal phenomenon this will lead to the succession of wetland plants in poyang lake becoming terrestrial plants thus causing the overall shrinkage of the poyang lake wetland qi et al 2014 5 summary the water index method has the advantages of being a simple method that is less time consuming than other methods and it has become a common method of water information extraction in the research by zhu et al 2019 ndvi ndwi and modified ndvi mndvi were selected to extract the water information of poyang lake bosten lake and alakol lake respectively and the extraction precision of different indexes was compared the results showed that the extraction accuracy of ndwi in these areas was relatively high therefore in this study the ndwi was selected to extract water extraction information the index can restrain vegetation information to the greatest extent highlight water information and effectively distinguish water from vegetation and mountain shadow but the impact of soil building and shadow will be ignored different background information has different influences on the accuracy of water extraction the use of only a single water index may have some impact on the results and more accurate water information extraction methods will be evaluated in a follow up study based on spatial information technology remote sensing and dem data and the ndwi the water area of poyang lake is extracted the water volume information is estimated with the dynamic storage capacity method the long term dynamic change in the water volume of poyang lake is studied from 1989 to 2018 and the driving factors and ecological impacts are analyzed the results are as follows 1 during 1989 2018 the largest water area of 4068 km2 appeared in 1998 and the smallest water area of 899 68 km2 appeared in 2014 showing an overall downward trend among the monthly changes the average water area was smallest in january and largest in july showing an increasing trend from january to july and a decreasing trend from august to january 2 during 1989 2018 the maximum water volume was 25 81 billion m3 in 1992 and the minimum water volume was 9 14 billion m3 in 2014 showing an overall decreasing trend in terms of the monthly changes the average water volume was smallest in january and largest in july with the water volume increasing from february to july and decreasing from august to february there was a significant correlation between the water area and water volume of poyang lake p 0 01 and the correlation coefficient was 0 991 for every 100 km2 of water area there were the storage capacity increased by 573 million m3 3 the water volume of poyang lake is mainly affected by natural and human factors the obvious seasonal changes in the precipitation in the poyang lake area and the influence of the yangtze river water regime mean that the quantity of the water in the poyang lake area shows seasonal changes in addition the construction of the three gorges project on the yangtze river will cause problems such as the extension of the duration of the dry season and the advancement of the dry season which will also bring a series of impacts to the wetland ecological environment 4 the relationship between the change in water volume and nh3 n concentration in poyang lake is obvious the relationship between the water quantity and nh3 n concentration data is significantly negative p 0 01 the pearson correlation coefficient is 0 679 and the increase in the water volume can reduce the concentration of pollutants in the lake area to a certain extent the increase in water volume will lead to a high lake water level while the higher water level will lead to a reduction in migratory bird habitat area which will have a negative impact on migratory bird habitats credit authorship contribution statement hai liu formal analysis methodology validation writing review editing liang zheng formal

5251,acquiring data for the soil water content θ is important for assessing vegetation growth drought and climate change however it is a time consuming and labor intensive task that is especially challenging in deep soils therefore we introduce the noninvasive technique of electrical resistivity tomography ert for indirectly determining θ through the development of prediction models for loessial regions under different site conditions i e soil texture land use soil depth and dry wet conditions we obtained 2769 pairs of electrical resistivity ρ and θ datasets using ert 53 sites and a neutron probe 69 access tubes on the chinese loess plateau we built linear and nonlinear models correlating ρ and θ and selected the best model according to the coefficient of determination r 2 and root mean square error rmse the uncertainty and sensitivity of ert derived θ were further evaluated and acceptable results were obtained the new models correlating ρ and θ under different site conditions are the first set of models based on field data from a loessial region and their acceptable performance makes them applicable for measuring different soil parameters in the loess plateau and possibly other loessial regions around the world keywords deep soil electrical resistivity land use loessial soil soil condition soil water content 1 introduction the soil water content θ is a crucial variable for modeling hydrological and biological processes that directly or indirectly influence the infiltration and distribution of rainwater soil erosion runoff plant growth and climate change the soil water content is not only very important for agricultural production the energy cycle material transport and other processes but is also spatiotemporally heterogeneous and scale dependent vereecken et al 2014 wang et al 2017 developments in climate change and human activity will affect the involvement of deep soil water in biogeochemical cycles in the upper soil layer and even near the surface wang et al 2013 in some cases such as extreme drought and massive planting of exotic species deep soil water usually below the annual rainfall infiltration depth i e below a 1 m depth on the chinese loess plateau plays an essential role in a series of aboveground eco hydrological processes and thus determines the stability and reliance of ecosystems nepstad et al 1994 yang et al 2014 ascertaining the spatial distribution dynamic changes and availability of deep soil water is necessary for evaluating and quantifying its contribution and importance however deep soil water has received little attention because its detection is expensive and there are technological limitations as well the soil water content is generally measured using time domain reflectometry robinet et al 2018 neutron probes hu et al 2010 hu et al 2009 or oven dried soil samples these methods are time consuming require the investment of considerable manpower and material resources and can damage the land they are also not feasible for measuring the water content in deep soil quickly obtaining soil water content data in the field is important for understanding the ecological and hydrological processes that occur in deep soils geophysical methods have proved to be considerably advantageous for measuring the soil water content corwin and lesch 2005 shanahan et al 2015 and include electrical resistivity tomography ert brunet et al 2010 vereecken et al 2014 electromagnetic induction emi huang et al 2016 sheets and hendrickx 1995 and ground penetrating radar gpr huisman et al 2003 tran et al 2015 these methods are minimally invasive and can real time monitor the spatial and temporal variations in the soil water content in the field they are more convenient and rapider than traditional methods binley et al 2002 didier et al 2003 shanahan et al 2015 sheets and hendrickx 1995 zhou et al 2001 terry et al 2018 gpr can effectively map changes in soil water near the surface and its performance is optimal for coarse soil but decreases in electrically conductive media such as clayey soils altdorff et al 2017 sheets and hendrickx 1995 emi is effective in detecting horizontal variations in soil water altdorff et al 2017 sheets and hendrickx 1995 and predicting the soil water content in shallow soil huang et al 2016 shanahan et al 2015 in contrast ert is more suited to measure the soil water content at different soil depths depending on the number of electrodes and their intervals during measurement dumont et al 2016 perrone et al 2014 rubio melendi et al 2018 samouëlian et al 2005 gpr and emi transmit electromagnetic waves to obtain data which are affected more by the surrounding environment and soil texture ert passes an electrical current through the soil and measures the resulting potential difference an inverse problem is solved to obtain the resistivity distribution and a relationship between the electrical resistivity and soil water content may be established which is an effective way to determine the soil water content in deep soil the first step is to develop a model correlating the electrical resistivity and soil water content for a specific area electrical resistivity is influenced by several factors such as the soil porosity soil saturation pore water resistivity and soil temperature archie 1942 dexter 2004 found that the soil texture influences the pore structure soil particle composition and soil water distribution thus it affects the soil resistivity moreover changes in land use may have large impacts on the soil water and structure and thus the electrical resistivity different land uses tend to have different management styles such as different tillage fertilizer application or irrigation methods plant root patterns according to different land uses may also affect the measurement of the electrical resistivity recently brillante et al 2014 found that other variables including the ph cation exchange capacity and contents of clay silt gravel organic carbon sand and caco3 may also affect the electrical resistivity as these factors are related to the salinity of the pore fluid surface conductivity and pore space therefore the land use pattern soil texture and other soil parameters should be considered when establishing the relationship between the electrical resistivity and soil water content some scientists have discussed the relationship between the electrical resistivity and soil water content to develop relevant models brillante et al 2015 calamita et al 2012 archie s laws are the most classic and consider the soil porosity saturation and electrical resistivity of soil pore water a few studies have simplified archie s laws by removing some of the predictors binley et al 2002 wenninger et al 2008 zhou et al 2001 and proposing linear didier et al 2003 goyal 1996 zhu et al 2007 and nonlinear relationships between the electrical resistivity and soil water content however most models are based on laboratory experiments that usually consider a single soil type e g loamy sandy or clayey soil models derived from field data are less available in the literature brillante et al 2014 brillante et al 2016 michot et al 2003 because the model accuracy theoretically and practically depends on the number and kind of input parameters which are highly spatially heterogeneous and scale dependent different models should be developed for different site conditions and regions around the world the chinese loess plateau clp has become increasingly green in recent years chen et al 2015 feng et al 2016 but the vegetation is consuming more deep soil water because of the limited water resources lu et al 2012 wang et al 2015a dynamic changes in the deep soil water content have significant impacts on groundwater storage and climate change and the survival of soil animals and aboveground plants in the critical zone cz of the clp cz clp therefore determining the deep soil water content is important for analyzing the eco hydrological processes in the cz clp new noninvasive techniques and methods for detecting deep soil water content in the cz clp are increasingly needed using ert to develop statistical relationships between the electrical resistivity and soil water content under different site conditions and then using these relationships to determine the soil water content is an effective approach although similar work has rarely been reported the objectives of this study were to 1 explore the characteristics of the electrical resistivity ρ and soil water content θ under different site conditions in the clp 2 evaluate the effects of land use soil texture soil depth and dry and wet soil conditions on the relationship between the electrical resistivity and soil water content 3 develop models for predicting the soil water content under different site conditions based on soil electrical resistivity data and 4 evaluate the sensitivity and uncertainty of electrical resistivity data to determine the soil water content 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted across the entire loess plateau fig 1 a this plateau is a continental monsoon region rainy in the summer and autumn and dry in the winter and spring the annual precipitation is 150 800 mm and approximately 60 of it falls from june to september the annual evaporation is 1400 2000 mm and the annual mean temperature ranges from 3 6 c in the northwest to 14 3 c in the southeast wang et al 2010 the soil is sandier in the northwest and has more clay in the southeast the gravimetric θ at soil layers of depth 0 500 cm is 0 8 38 7 for the entire loess plateau the plateau is a water limited ecosystem and has a wide distribution of dried soil layers that can be as thick as 16 m we preselected 53 sites across the cz clp to determine ρ the 53 sites contained 69 neutron probe access tubes that crossed two climatic zones sub humid and semi arid and three provinces shaanxi gansu and ningxia fig 1a an ert measurement line covers more than one access tube so we had more access tubes than ert measurement sites the land uses of the 53 sites were classified as cropland forest and grassland more than 95 of the cropland had no irrigation facilities the sites had an altitude of 594 2128 m the 53 sites were distributed in four sub regions on the clp fig 1b f descriptions of the four sub regions are presented in table 1 2 2 data collection and measurements 2 2 1 electrical resistivity we used a syscal pro switch manufactured by iris instruments france to determine ρ three main components were used for ert 48 electrodes two lines and one host we selected alpha wenner arrays to measure ρ loke 2000 taking the first sub region fig 1c and fig 2 a as an example fig 2b shows the electrode coordinates of the five measurement lines at the study area and fig 2c indicates the field layout of one of the five measurement lines a total of 360 points can be obtained from one measure line for the syscal pro switch instrument the maximum electrode spacing of the cable is 5 m so the theoretical maximum measured distance is 227 5 m and the maximum measured depth is 75 m the experimental voltage for ert was set to 400 v fig 2d presents the profile of ρ measured in the first sub region we used trimble geo 7x trimble inc to obtain the longitude latitude and altitude of each electrode and access tube six electrode intervals were used 5 m 16 sites 2 5 m 3 sites 1 5 m 6 sites 1 m 2 sites 0 5 m 22 sites and 0 2 m 4 sites the experiments at these 53 sites were performed from may 28 2017 to may 31 2018 2 2 2 soil water content a cnc503dr neutron probe troxler electronic laboratories inc usa was used to measure θ at 10 cm intervals from 0 to 100 cm and at 20 cm intervals below 100 cm the volumetric θ cm3 cm3 was calculated from slow neutron counting rates using a linear calibration curve wang et al 2015b the neutron probe access tubes and host for ert were placed in the middle of the measurement line to measure ρ of deep areas near the access tubes fig 2c to obtain more data pairs the electrode spacing was varied to cover as many access tubes as possible generally the ρ sensitivity and resolution at the two ends of the ert measuring lines are low therefore in our analysis only the access tubes near the middle of the measuring lines were selected the soil particle composition at all sampling points near the access tubes was previously measured wang et al 2015a b zhao et al 2017 with a mastersizer 2000 laser instrument malvern uk the soil textures were obtained according to the usda texture triangle with the r texture package 2 3 accuracy control of the ert inversion 2 3 1 electrical resistivity inversion res2dinvx64 software can be used to automatically calculate a two dimensional ρ model with data collected from electrical imaging surveys the software uses the regularized smoothness constrained least squares method for ρ inversion de groot hedlin and constable 1990 and is based on the following objective function 1 φ s φ s w s m m ref x φ x w x m β φ d w d d prd d obs φ d tar where ϕs ϕx and ϕd are general measure function ϕs determines how close the model m is to the reference model mref ϕx is the amount of structure in the model ϕd is the misfit between the predicted data dpred and the observation dobs ws wx and wd are weghting matrices the normal equations loke et al 2003 used in this method is given by 2 j t j λ f δ q k j t g λ f q k where f is a smoothing matrix f α x c x t c x α z c z t c z cx is the horizontal roughness filter cz is the vertical roughness filter j is the jacobian matrix of partial derivatives jt is the transpose of j qk is the change in the model resistivity values g is data misfit means the difference between the calculated and measured apparent resistivity values the magnitude of g is frequently given as a rms root mean squared value which is the quantity that the inversion method seeks to reduce in an attempt to find a better model after each iteration λ is the damping factor which balances the effects of g and f the larger the λ the smoother will be the model but the apparent resistivity rms error will probably be larger the optimum damping factor is automatically determined by the software with the l curve method farquharson and oldenburg 2004 thus we choose l curve method to obtain the optimal λ when setting inversion parameters the eq 2 with the lowest possible rms error sometimes shows large and unrealistic variations in ρ values therefore we set seven iterations to obtain a stable rms the least squares method minimizes the combination of the model smoothness and data misfit sometimes an additional constraint is used in situations where the model must be close to some reference model as shown in the following equation 3 j t j λ f μ i δ q k j t g λ f q k λ μ q k q m where the additional damping factor μ controls the degree to which the inversion model is close to the reference model qm the qm is usually a homogeneous half space model which helps to stabilize the inversion model by reducing large departures from a fixed resistivity value farquharson and oldenburg 2004 μ controls the degree which the resistivity variations from the background model is constrained a larger μ will result smaller variations normally the range of μ is 0 01 to 0 10 we set μ to 0 01 in setting inversion parameters res2dinv software offered two different methods to solve the least squares equation to reduce the inversion time we chose the incomplete gauss newton method which uses iteration to calculate an approximate solution the incomplete gauss newton method has an option of scaling the matrices to improve the convergence of the iterative method there was significant topographical relief along the survey line so the influence of the topographical effects was considered for data inversion details on the inversion parameters are presented in supplementary table s1 fig 3 a shows the ρ inversion profiles of five measurement lines in the first sub region it should be noted that these five ρ transects had separate quality control and inversion procedures after being processed separately using the res2dinvx64 software these five ρ transects were combined in the gis software before inversion we used apparent ρ pseudosection to remove any bad data points noise estimates based on reciprocal measurements were not considered owing to time constraints instead we used the diagonal filter and l curve method to select the damping factor this method essentially estimates the data misfit and model roughness for a large range of damping factor values in addition the resolution and sensitivity of ρ was calculated to control the quality of ρ the average of all the relative misfit for all the inversions was 8 1 with a minimum and maximum value of 2 and 20 7 respectively there were 11 sites with rms 10 accounting for 21 of the total number of sites the correlation coefficient between θ and ρ for these data was 0 78 at the significant level of 0 01 which can be fitted by a power function r2 0 78 this implies that to large extent these data does not affect the subsequent correlation analysis we further found that the sites with large rms were generally characterized complex terrain conditions for example some of the measuring lines in the field crossed a deep trench which would inevitably lead to the poor ground contact at a small number of electrodes and thus could cause a large value of rms it should be noted that as a general rule data points in a ρ pseudosection with errors higher than 100 can usually be removed loke 2000 since the errors for each data point collected at the above 11 sites were basically less than 50 we retained the 11 ρ profiles to conduct further analysis although their rms values were higher than 10 2 3 2 ert sensitivity and resolution we used cumulative sensitivity to evaluate how the model parameters affect the modeled measurements henderson et al 2009 a higher cumulative sensitivity value indicates that the ρ value of the model is more reliable the surface soil usually has a high sensitivity value because the sensitivity function has a very large value near the electrode res2dinvx64 can be used to calculate the integrated sensitivity value associated with each model block as follows 4 s i 1 m j 1 m j ij eq 4 is the sum of the jacobian matrix values associated with the model blocks of all data points fig 3c and d show the relative sensitivity and smoothed sensitivity profiles respectively of five measurement lines in the first sub region this is a rough measure of the sensitivity information from model blocks in the datasets we use the model resolution to evaluate the quality of resistivity david caterina et al 2013 it should be noted that resolution is theoretically for linear problems for non linear problems such as here it is an approximation which is valid if the estimated model is not fare from the actual one the model resolution matrix is given by 5 r j t j λ f 1 j t j the resolution of the model block is given by the diagonal elements of the matrix the model resolution matrix r can be regarded as a filter through which the inversion method tries to resolve the underground ρ day lewis et al 2005 because the resolution of ρ decreases exponentially with depth the damping factor used in the inverted least squares method is usually increased with depth to stabilize the inversion process the model resolution multiplied by the number of model cells can eliminate the influence of model discretization loke et al 2014 argued that a reasonable cutoff value for the model resolution index is about 5 10 fig 3b shows the resolution index profiles of five measurement lines in the first sub region the black line in fig 3 is a contour with a resolution index equal to 10 all ρ profiles with a resolution index of less than 10 were excluded from the current study there may be a considerable amount of uncertainty in the resistivity measurements as there are no repeated measurements however this problem could be solved by setting a stricter resolution index 2 3 3 temperature correction for resistivity because ρ highly depends on temperature we calibrated the measured ρ to the value of ρ at the standard temperature of 25 c ρ was calibrated to the normalized temperature of 25 c as follows campbell et al 1948 6 ρ t ρ 25 1 α t 25 where ρt is ρ at temperature t ρ25 is ρ at t 25 c and α is the empirical coefficient usually equal to 0 025 c under these conditions the deviation of ρ was 2 5 because of the temperature deviation of 1 c to calculate the soil temperature at different soil depths the following model was derived musy and soutter 1991 7 t z t t mean a i r a 2 e z d sin w t φ z 4 d where t z t is the temperature on day t and at depth z tmean air is the yearly mean value of the air temperature a is the difference between the maximum and minimum air temperatures z is the soil depth d is the depth parameter of the model φ is the interval between the maximum and minimum temperature days and w is the frequency of the periodic variation p w 2π p where p 365 days from the 10 year 2006 2015 daily air temperature data recorded by seven meteorological stations the relative positions of the meteorological stations and research sites are shown in supplementary fig s1 we obtained the parameters tmean air a φ d and w of all sites supplementary tables s2 s4 supplementary fig s2 presents the simulation results for the soil temperature at different soil depths 2 4 regression analysis after the above analysis the actual ρ values with high sensitivity and resolution had to be screened out the actual ρ points were interpolated into the corresponding resolution raster data in this way 53 ρ profiles with relative horizontal distances and vertical depths could be obtained according to the relative positions of the access tubes and electrodes the ρ values at different soil depths were extracted to the corresponding positions of the access tubes after ρ quality control and inversion a total of 2769 data pairs were finally obtained to explore the relationship between ρ and θ and build the prediction models we selected linear and nonlinear equations to build models establishing for the relationship between ρ and θ the general linear regression equation is 8 θ α 1 ρ α 2 the general nonlinear regression equation is 9 θ m ρ α ε where α1 α2 and α are parameters of the equation ε is the error and m ρ α is the kernel mean function john fox 2002 the nls package in the program r was used to estimate the parameters as follows 10 s α θ m α ρ 2 where s α is the residual the solution with the minimum residual does not have a general formula unlike the linear least squares problem thus we used an iterative procedure starting with initial values for the parameters we needed to set the initial values for the parameters m ρ α by continuously changing these parameters to minimize the residual s α fox and weisberg 2010 we built four kinds of linear models based on different datasets 1 ρ data after logarithmic transformation 2 θ data after log transformation 3 both ρ and θ data after log transformation and 4 ρ and θ data without log transformation we selected four kinds of functions for the nonlinear m ρ α model cubic reciprocal exponential and power we randomly selected 80 of the datasets to build models and the remaining 20 to verify the accuracy of the models the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse between predicted and measured values of θ for 20 of the datasets were used to test the model accuracy as follows 11 r i 0 n m θ i m θ p θ i p θ m θ i m θ 2 p θ i p θ 2 where r is the correlation coefficient n is the number of test 20 datasets mθ i is the ith measured θ in these datasets pθ i is the ith predicted θ in these datasets and m θ and p θ are the sample means of the measured and predicted θ respectively for these datasets a higher square of the correlation coefficient indicates higher model accuracy we used the pearson correlation coefficient to test the relationship between ρ and θ the rmse was calculated as follows 12 rmse e p θ m θ 2 where e represents the formula for calculating the mean value a lower rmse indicates higher model accuracy the statistical evaluation of the results was improved by splitting the datasets 1000 times 80 of the total datasets comprised training data and the remaining 20 comprised testing data to generate the mean and standard deviation sd of the 1000 r 2 and rmse values 2 5 quantifying uncertainty and sensitivity of ert derived θ we used the international organization for standardization guides to the expression of uncertainty in measurement iso gum to evaluate uncertainty the steps to evaluate uncertainty are as follows chen et al 2018 despax et al 2016 θ is not measured directly but derived from ert the functional relationship is as follows 13 θ f ρ where f is the optimal model determined by the rmse and r2 values using eqs 8 11 identifying the uncertainty source for ert derived θ we estimated uncertainty using the following equation 14 u c θ θ ρ u ρ where uc θ is the combined standard uncertainty of the output quantity and u ρ is the standard uncertainty of the input quantity the uncertainty of the input quantity in this study was the uncertainty in ert measurements if the model resolution was calculated the uncertainty value can also be calculated simultaneously from the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix 15 j t j λ f 1 the mean value of uncertainty for all ert measurements was 9 8 with the minimum and the maximum value of 1 8 and 30 7 respectively only seven records had great uncertainty with high value more than 20 our field notes showed that all the seven records were set by a smaller electrode spacing 20 cm which may greatly increase the possibility of poor ground contact for a small number of electrodes and thus leading to a large uncertainty we used the standardized regression coefficient src sensitivity index to evaluate the influence of ρ on the model output i e θ the src function is integrated into the sensitivity package saltelli 2002 in the r program bouazizi et al 2019 introduced detailed computational processes for determining src sensitivity indicators the src index expresses the variance in θ due to variable ρ bouazizi et al 2019 all statistical analyses were performed with microsoft excel version 2013 spss version 22 0 or r version 3 3 3 the maps of the sample sites and ρ profiles were generated with gis software esri arcmap 10 3 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of ρ and θ under the various site conditions 3 1 1 soil texture table 2 indicates that θ ranges from 5 2 to 51 6 with a mean of 21 2 and ρ ranges from 13 2 to 271 9 ω m with a mean of 96 8 ω m moreover ρ and θ were highly variable and thus the obtained datasets may reflect the whole range of values in the loessial soil the soil textures at the sampling points were mainly silty clayey loam sicllo n 279 and silty loam silo n 2475 fig 4 and table 2 ρ differed significantly between sicllo and silo fig 5 a p 0 05 the average ρ was lower for sicllo 74 4 ω m than silo 99 1 ω m ρ decreased with increasing clay and silt contents uhlemann et al 2017 because ρ is substantially lower at high clay content owing to the additional matrix conduction caused by ion movement on the surface of clay particles gunn et al 2015 uhlemann et al 2017 consequently the soil particle composition had a significant impact on ρ and should be considered when building a model brillante et al 2014 an effective approach is to develop different models for different soil textures as the results for loam lo and sandy loam salo textures were not convincing because of the small sample sizes 9 and 6 respectively we did not build models for the lo and salo data silo had the largest sample size so we used the silo data for the following analysis 3 1 2 land use ρ differed significantly among cropland forest and grassland fig 5c and its frequency distribution for cropland differed considerably from the distributions for forest and grassland fig 6 the ρ values for cropland forest and grassland were centrally distributed at 0 50 90 120 and 120 280 ω m respectively the average ρ values were in the order of forest 165 1 ω m grassland 111 7 ω m cropland 30 2 ω m compared to grassland and forest cropland was characterized by a low ρ which was usually caused by poor compaction a good water regime and sparse root distribution archie 1942 rossi et al 2011 the average θ values were in the order of cropland 30 7 grassland 14 8 forest 13 4 this sequence is similar to the results of wang et al 2012 who obtained data across the entire clp θ depended strongly on land use because the root depth distribution photosynthesis and transpiration of plants shape the patterns of soil water in terms of both space and time wang et al 2015a 3 1 3 soil depth we divided the silo data into two groups soil depth 100 cm sd 100 n 880 and soil depth 100 cm sd 100 n 1595 this is because θ fluctuated considerably in the 0 100 cm layer but was more stable below 100 cm in the clp wang et al 2011 ρ and θ differed significantly between sd 100 and sd 100 p 0 05 fig 7 the median and mean ρ values were lower for sd 100 36 4 and 86 0 ω m respectively than for sd 100 137 1 and 122 7 ω m respectively in contrast the median and mean θ values were lower for sd 100 19 6 and 19 5 respectively than for sd 100 21 7 and 22 8 respectively shallow soil is characterized by strong evapotranspiration and the presence of numerous vegetation roots which may be why ρ was higher in shallow soil than in deep soil and θ was lower in shallow soil than in deep soil 3 1 4 dry and wet soil conditions establishing prediction models for θ under dry and wet soil conditions is important for hydrological modeling and soil water resource management it has been reported that 60 of the field capacity generally θ is 10 in the loess plateau based on soil texture is the upper limit of a dried soil layer wang et al 2010 wang et al 2018 θ 20 would mean a good soil water regime for plant growth on the clp in the current study we divided θ into three grades θ 10 n 629 10 θ 20 n 709 and θ 20 n 1431 the corresponding mean values of ρ were 169 5 126 5 and 50 1 ω m respectively table 3 the variability of ρ for the datasets was lower for dry soil than wet soil average cvs were 0 25 0 47 and 1 03 respectively θ was also less variable for dry soil than wet soil average cvs were 0 13 0 20 and 0 27 respectively although the differences were small under the dry condition the variabilities of ρ and θ differed slightly however the differences increased significantly when the soil was wet this agrees with existing studies al hagrey et al 2004 binley et al 2002 brunet et al 2010 cosenza et al 2006 calamita et al 2012 reported that the relationship between ρ and θ is linear if the ρ and θ variabilities are similar and nonlinear if the two variabilities differ considerably the sample sizes of cropland for θ 10 and grassland for θ 20 were 16 and 16 respectively so we did not build a corresponding model for these two datasets 3 2 regression models of the soil water content under different conditions all models n 64 performed acceptably under the various site conditions p 0 01 although the accuracy considerably differed cv 0 62 table 4 and supplementary tables s5 and fig s3 in case of soil texture the model accuracy was better for silo average r 2 0 6 than sicllo for silo almost all residuals fluctuated randomly around zero fig 8 however for sicllo there existed a trend in residual distribution therefore in soils with high clay content there was high uncertainty in ert derived θ in addition θ was more variable for silo cv 0 54 than for sicllo cv 0 35 which may account for the higher accuracy of the silo models compared to the sicllo models in terms of land use cropland had the highest average r 2 while forest and grassland had an average r 2 of 0 1 we could find a clear pattern of residuals for grassland and forest which may be explained by the different root patterns and water uptake traits between the two land uses when using ert to derive θ for forest or grassland root induced variation should be considered in building the model for the soil depth the model accuracy was higher for sd 100 r2 0 79 rmse 6 05 than for sd 100 r2 0 40 rmse 6 13 ρ and θ were more susceptible to the external environmental factors such as the root density rainfall infiltration and redistribution and animal and human activities in the surface soil the distribution of residuals for shallow soil still had an obvious trend fig 8 therefore for soil depths less than 1 m it is necessary to consider external environmental factors for building the transfer function model of θ supplementary fig s4 further indicates that the model accuracy depends on the grade of θ generally models performed better when θ 10 or θ 20 than when 10 θ 20 all models performed poorly at 10 θ 20 except for the forest model 3 3 uncertainty and sensitivity of ert derived θ the uncertainty of θ derived from ert varied with site conditions which was caused basically by a global uncertainty by using ert to project water content for all data the range of uncertainty was 0 2 14 1 95 confidence interval with a mean value of 2 3 the uncertainty of the first sampling area was large with a mean value of 4 1 topographically the first sampling area was divided into slope land and gully land for slope land the uncertainty associated with the electrode spacing of 0 2 m was greater than that of other electrode spacings see table 1 such an uncertainty which was 20 15 2 ωm mainly came from the global uncertainty resulting from abnormal contact between the electrodes and wires for gully land a high uncertainty was found when the electrode spacing was set to 5 m this uncertainty came from the model uncertainty this may be caused by the shallow groundwater level about 10 m on the gully land according to our field monitoring among different land uses the uncertainty of cropland 0 7 9 9 with a mean value of 4 3 was greater than that of forest 0 1 2 3 with a mean value of 0 7 and grassland 0 3 2 4 with a mean value of 1 4 for cropland the data with high uncertainty was distributed at the bottom for gully land in the first sampling area with a mean value of 4 5 and this uncertainty mainly came from model uncertainty for grassland the uncertainty associated with the electrode spacing of 5 m with a mean value of 1 9 was more than 0 5 m with a mean value of 0 7 and this uncertainty came from global uncertainty which was 11 11 4 ωm setting large electrode spacing may result in a lower resolution for forest the data with high uncertainty was distributed at the slope land in the first sampling area and associated with the electrode spacing of 0 2 m with a mean value of 1 5 and this uncertainty mainly came from global uncertainty which was 20 15 2 ωm as for soil texture the uncertainty of silo 0 2 14 4 with a mean value of 2 4 was greater than that of sicllo 0 4 1 7 with a mean value of 0 9 the sources of uncertainty for silo were similar to that for all other data in the first sampling area with great global uncertainty soil texture belongs to silo after removing these data the uncertainty of silo with a mean value of 0 7 was smaller than that of sicllo this uncertainty mainly came from model uncertainty hence we may further infer that there was a high model uncertainty in ert derived θ in soils with higher clay content in terms of soil depth the uncertainty of deep soil 0 4 7 9 with a mean value of 3 0 was greater than that of shallow soil 0 1 10 4 with a mean value of 1 1 we found that all the values for deep soil located at the bottom of the gully in the first sampling area showed high uncertainty with a mean value of 3 8 this further indicated that shallow groundwater produces high uncertainties in ert derived θ values sensitivity analysis further showed that ert derived θ values for cropland showed the lowest sensitivity to ρ compared with the other conditions fig 9 almost 95 of the cropland was located at the bottom of the gully land in the first sampling area this part of cropland was affected by shallow groundwater thus resulting in low sensitivity of ert derived θ 4 conclusions we measured 2769 pairs of ρ and θ data with ert and a neutron probe across the entire cz clp the average ρ differed significantly with land use soil texture and soil depth which significantly affected the relationship between ρ and θ the models based on sd 100 performed the best r 2 0 79 rmse 6 05 followed by those based on silo data r 2 0 70 and rmse 6 44 and all data the models based on the land use data performed poorly especially for forest r 2 0 06 rmse 6 34 however all models provided a significance level of 0 01 with acceptable performance levels the wet and dry soil conditions affected the model performance these new models are the first set of models based on field data across the cz clp and their relatively high performance level makes them applicable for measuring different soil parameters in the clp region and possibly other similar regions around the world credit authorship contribution statement hui sun formal analysis

5251,acquiring data for the soil water content θ is important for assessing vegetation growth drought and climate change however it is a time consuming and labor intensive task that is especially challenging in deep soils therefore we introduce the noninvasive technique of electrical resistivity tomography ert for indirectly determining θ through the development of prediction models for loessial regions under different site conditions i e soil texture land use soil depth and dry wet conditions we obtained 2769 pairs of electrical resistivity ρ and θ datasets using ert 53 sites and a neutron probe 69 access tubes on the chinese loess plateau we built linear and nonlinear models correlating ρ and θ and selected the best model according to the coefficient of determination r 2 and root mean square error rmse the uncertainty and sensitivity of ert derived θ were further evaluated and acceptable results were obtained the new models correlating ρ and θ under different site conditions are the first set of models based on field data from a loessial region and their acceptable performance makes them applicable for measuring different soil parameters in the loess plateau and possibly other loessial regions around the world keywords deep soil electrical resistivity land use loessial soil soil condition soil water content 1 introduction the soil water content θ is a crucial variable for modeling hydrological and biological processes that directly or indirectly influence the infiltration and distribution of rainwater soil erosion runoff plant growth and climate change the soil water content is not only very important for agricultural production the energy cycle material transport and other processes but is also spatiotemporally heterogeneous and scale dependent vereecken et al 2014 wang et al 2017 developments in climate change and human activity will affect the involvement of deep soil water in biogeochemical cycles in the upper soil layer and even near the surface wang et al 2013 in some cases such as extreme drought and massive planting of exotic species deep soil water usually below the annual rainfall infiltration depth i e below a 1 m depth on the chinese loess plateau plays an essential role in a series of aboveground eco hydrological processes and thus determines the stability and reliance of ecosystems nepstad et al 1994 yang et al 2014 ascertaining the spatial distribution dynamic changes and availability of deep soil water is necessary for evaluating and quantifying its contribution and importance however deep soil water has received little attention because its detection is expensive and there are technological limitations as well the soil water content is generally measured using time domain reflectometry robinet et al 2018 neutron probes hu et al 2010 hu et al 2009 or oven dried soil samples these methods are time consuming require the investment of considerable manpower and material resources and can damage the land they are also not feasible for measuring the water content in deep soil quickly obtaining soil water content data in the field is important for understanding the ecological and hydrological processes that occur in deep soils geophysical methods have proved to be considerably advantageous for measuring the soil water content corwin and lesch 2005 shanahan et al 2015 and include electrical resistivity tomography ert brunet et al 2010 vereecken et al 2014 electromagnetic induction emi huang et al 2016 sheets and hendrickx 1995 and ground penetrating radar gpr huisman et al 2003 tran et al 2015 these methods are minimally invasive and can real time monitor the spatial and temporal variations in the soil water content in the field they are more convenient and rapider than traditional methods binley et al 2002 didier et al 2003 shanahan et al 2015 sheets and hendrickx 1995 zhou et al 2001 terry et al 2018 gpr can effectively map changes in soil water near the surface and its performance is optimal for coarse soil but decreases in electrically conductive media such as clayey soils altdorff et al 2017 sheets and hendrickx 1995 emi is effective in detecting horizontal variations in soil water altdorff et al 2017 sheets and hendrickx 1995 and predicting the soil water content in shallow soil huang et al 2016 shanahan et al 2015 in contrast ert is more suited to measure the soil water content at different soil depths depending on the number of electrodes and their intervals during measurement dumont et al 2016 perrone et al 2014 rubio melendi et al 2018 samouëlian et al 2005 gpr and emi transmit electromagnetic waves to obtain data which are affected more by the surrounding environment and soil texture ert passes an electrical current through the soil and measures the resulting potential difference an inverse problem is solved to obtain the resistivity distribution and a relationship between the electrical resistivity and soil water content may be established which is an effective way to determine the soil water content in deep soil the first step is to develop a model correlating the electrical resistivity and soil water content for a specific area electrical resistivity is influenced by several factors such as the soil porosity soil saturation pore water resistivity and soil temperature archie 1942 dexter 2004 found that the soil texture influences the pore structure soil particle composition and soil water distribution thus it affects the soil resistivity moreover changes in land use may have large impacts on the soil water and structure and thus the electrical resistivity different land uses tend to have different management styles such as different tillage fertilizer application or irrigation methods plant root patterns according to different land uses may also affect the measurement of the electrical resistivity recently brillante et al 2014 found that other variables including the ph cation exchange capacity and contents of clay silt gravel organic carbon sand and caco3 may also affect the electrical resistivity as these factors are related to the salinity of the pore fluid surface conductivity and pore space therefore the land use pattern soil texture and other soil parameters should be considered when establishing the relationship between the electrical resistivity and soil water content some scientists have discussed the relationship between the electrical resistivity and soil water content to develop relevant models brillante et al 2015 calamita et al 2012 archie s laws are the most classic and consider the soil porosity saturation and electrical resistivity of soil pore water a few studies have simplified archie s laws by removing some of the predictors binley et al 2002 wenninger et al 2008 zhou et al 2001 and proposing linear didier et al 2003 goyal 1996 zhu et al 2007 and nonlinear relationships between the electrical resistivity and soil water content however most models are based on laboratory experiments that usually consider a single soil type e g loamy sandy or clayey soil models derived from field data are less available in the literature brillante et al 2014 brillante et al 2016 michot et al 2003 because the model accuracy theoretically and practically depends on the number and kind of input parameters which are highly spatially heterogeneous and scale dependent different models should be developed for different site conditions and regions around the world the chinese loess plateau clp has become increasingly green in recent years chen et al 2015 feng et al 2016 but the vegetation is consuming more deep soil water because of the limited water resources lu et al 2012 wang et al 2015a dynamic changes in the deep soil water content have significant impacts on groundwater storage and climate change and the survival of soil animals and aboveground plants in the critical zone cz of the clp cz clp therefore determining the deep soil water content is important for analyzing the eco hydrological processes in the cz clp new noninvasive techniques and methods for detecting deep soil water content in the cz clp are increasingly needed using ert to develop statistical relationships between the electrical resistivity and soil water content under different site conditions and then using these relationships to determine the soil water content is an effective approach although similar work has rarely been reported the objectives of this study were to 1 explore the characteristics of the electrical resistivity ρ and soil water content θ under different site conditions in the clp 2 evaluate the effects of land use soil texture soil depth and dry and wet soil conditions on the relationship between the electrical resistivity and soil water content 3 develop models for predicting the soil water content under different site conditions based on soil electrical resistivity data and 4 evaluate the sensitivity and uncertainty of electrical resistivity data to determine the soil water content 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted across the entire loess plateau fig 1 a this plateau is a continental monsoon region rainy in the summer and autumn and dry in the winter and spring the annual precipitation is 150 800 mm and approximately 60 of it falls from june to september the annual evaporation is 1400 2000 mm and the annual mean temperature ranges from 3 6 c in the northwest to 14 3 c in the southeast wang et al 2010 the soil is sandier in the northwest and has more clay in the southeast the gravimetric θ at soil layers of depth 0 500 cm is 0 8 38 7 for the entire loess plateau the plateau is a water limited ecosystem and has a wide distribution of dried soil layers that can be as thick as 16 m we preselected 53 sites across the cz clp to determine ρ the 53 sites contained 69 neutron probe access tubes that crossed two climatic zones sub humid and semi arid and three provinces shaanxi gansu and ningxia fig 1a an ert measurement line covers more than one access tube so we had more access tubes than ert measurement sites the land uses of the 53 sites were classified as cropland forest and grassland more than 95 of the cropland had no irrigation facilities the sites had an altitude of 594 2128 m the 53 sites were distributed in four sub regions on the clp fig 1b f descriptions of the four sub regions are presented in table 1 2 2 data collection and measurements 2 2 1 electrical resistivity we used a syscal pro switch manufactured by iris instruments france to determine ρ three main components were used for ert 48 electrodes two lines and one host we selected alpha wenner arrays to measure ρ loke 2000 taking the first sub region fig 1c and fig 2 a as an example fig 2b shows the electrode coordinates of the five measurement lines at the study area and fig 2c indicates the field layout of one of the five measurement lines a total of 360 points can be obtained from one measure line for the syscal pro switch instrument the maximum electrode spacing of the cable is 5 m so the theoretical maximum measured distance is 227 5 m and the maximum measured depth is 75 m the experimental voltage for ert was set to 400 v fig 2d presents the profile of ρ measured in the first sub region we used trimble geo 7x trimble inc to obtain the longitude latitude and altitude of each electrode and access tube six electrode intervals were used 5 m 16 sites 2 5 m 3 sites 1 5 m 6 sites 1 m 2 sites 0 5 m 22 sites and 0 2 m 4 sites the experiments at these 53 sites were performed from may 28 2017 to may 31 2018 2 2 2 soil water content a cnc503dr neutron probe troxler electronic laboratories inc usa was used to measure θ at 10 cm intervals from 0 to 100 cm and at 20 cm intervals below 100 cm the volumetric θ cm3 cm3 was calculated from slow neutron counting rates using a linear calibration curve wang et al 2015b the neutron probe access tubes and host for ert were placed in the middle of the measurement line to measure ρ of deep areas near the access tubes fig 2c to obtain more data pairs the electrode spacing was varied to cover as many access tubes as possible generally the ρ sensitivity and resolution at the two ends of the ert measuring lines are low therefore in our analysis only the access tubes near the middle of the measuring lines were selected the soil particle composition at all sampling points near the access tubes was previously measured wang et al 2015a b zhao et al 2017 with a mastersizer 2000 laser instrument malvern uk the soil textures were obtained according to the usda texture triangle with the r texture package 2 3 accuracy control of the ert inversion 2 3 1 electrical resistivity inversion res2dinvx64 software can be used to automatically calculate a two dimensional ρ model with data collected from electrical imaging surveys the software uses the regularized smoothness constrained least squares method for ρ inversion de groot hedlin and constable 1990 and is based on the following objective function 1 φ s φ s w s m m ref x φ x w x m β φ d w d d prd d obs φ d tar where ϕs ϕx and ϕd are general measure function ϕs determines how close the model m is to the reference model mref ϕx is the amount of structure in the model ϕd is the misfit between the predicted data dpred and the observation dobs ws wx and wd are weghting matrices the normal equations loke et al 2003 used in this method is given by 2 j t j λ f δ q k j t g λ f q k where f is a smoothing matrix f α x c x t c x α z c z t c z cx is the horizontal roughness filter cz is the vertical roughness filter j is the jacobian matrix of partial derivatives jt is the transpose of j qk is the change in the model resistivity values g is data misfit means the difference between the calculated and measured apparent resistivity values the magnitude of g is frequently given as a rms root mean squared value which is the quantity that the inversion method seeks to reduce in an attempt to find a better model after each iteration λ is the damping factor which balances the effects of g and f the larger the λ the smoother will be the model but the apparent resistivity rms error will probably be larger the optimum damping factor is automatically determined by the software with the l curve method farquharson and oldenburg 2004 thus we choose l curve method to obtain the optimal λ when setting inversion parameters the eq 2 with the lowest possible rms error sometimes shows large and unrealistic variations in ρ values therefore we set seven iterations to obtain a stable rms the least squares method minimizes the combination of the model smoothness and data misfit sometimes an additional constraint is used in situations where the model must be close to some reference model as shown in the following equation 3 j t j λ f μ i δ q k j t g λ f q k λ μ q k q m where the additional damping factor μ controls the degree to which the inversion model is close to the reference model qm the qm is usually a homogeneous half space model which helps to stabilize the inversion model by reducing large departures from a fixed resistivity value farquharson and oldenburg 2004 μ controls the degree which the resistivity variations from the background model is constrained a larger μ will result smaller variations normally the range of μ is 0 01 to 0 10 we set μ to 0 01 in setting inversion parameters res2dinv software offered two different methods to solve the least squares equation to reduce the inversion time we chose the incomplete gauss newton method which uses iteration to calculate an approximate solution the incomplete gauss newton method has an option of scaling the matrices to improve the convergence of the iterative method there was significant topographical relief along the survey line so the influence of the topographical effects was considered for data inversion details on the inversion parameters are presented in supplementary table s1 fig 3 a shows the ρ inversion profiles of five measurement lines in the first sub region it should be noted that these five ρ transects had separate quality control and inversion procedures after being processed separately using the res2dinvx64 software these five ρ transects were combined in the gis software before inversion we used apparent ρ pseudosection to remove any bad data points noise estimates based on reciprocal measurements were not considered owing to time constraints instead we used the diagonal filter and l curve method to select the damping factor this method essentially estimates the data misfit and model roughness for a large range of damping factor values in addition the resolution and sensitivity of ρ was calculated to control the quality of ρ the average of all the relative misfit for all the inversions was 8 1 with a minimum and maximum value of 2 and 20 7 respectively there were 11 sites with rms 10 accounting for 21 of the total number of sites the correlation coefficient between θ and ρ for these data was 0 78 at the significant level of 0 01 which can be fitted by a power function r2 0 78 this implies that to large extent these data does not affect the subsequent correlation analysis we further found that the sites with large rms were generally characterized complex terrain conditions for example some of the measuring lines in the field crossed a deep trench which would inevitably lead to the poor ground contact at a small number of electrodes and thus could cause a large value of rms it should be noted that as a general rule data points in a ρ pseudosection with errors higher than 100 can usually be removed loke 2000 since the errors for each data point collected at the above 11 sites were basically less than 50 we retained the 11 ρ profiles to conduct further analysis although their rms values were higher than 10 2 3 2 ert sensitivity and resolution we used cumulative sensitivity to evaluate how the model parameters affect the modeled measurements henderson et al 2009 a higher cumulative sensitivity value indicates that the ρ value of the model is more reliable the surface soil usually has a high sensitivity value because the sensitivity function has a very large value near the electrode res2dinvx64 can be used to calculate the integrated sensitivity value associated with each model block as follows 4 s i 1 m j 1 m j ij eq 4 is the sum of the jacobian matrix values associated with the model blocks of all data points fig 3c and d show the relative sensitivity and smoothed sensitivity profiles respectively of five measurement lines in the first sub region this is a rough measure of the sensitivity information from model blocks in the datasets we use the model resolution to evaluate the quality of resistivity david caterina et al 2013 it should be noted that resolution is theoretically for linear problems for non linear problems such as here it is an approximation which is valid if the estimated model is not fare from the actual one the model resolution matrix is given by 5 r j t j λ f 1 j t j the resolution of the model block is given by the diagonal elements of the matrix the model resolution matrix r can be regarded as a filter through which the inversion method tries to resolve the underground ρ day lewis et al 2005 because the resolution of ρ decreases exponentially with depth the damping factor used in the inverted least squares method is usually increased with depth to stabilize the inversion process the model resolution multiplied by the number of model cells can eliminate the influence of model discretization loke et al 2014 argued that a reasonable cutoff value for the model resolution index is about 5 10 fig 3b shows the resolution index profiles of five measurement lines in the first sub region the black line in fig 3 is a contour with a resolution index equal to 10 all ρ profiles with a resolution index of less than 10 were excluded from the current study there may be a considerable amount of uncertainty in the resistivity measurements as there are no repeated measurements however this problem could be solved by setting a stricter resolution index 2 3 3 temperature correction for resistivity because ρ highly depends on temperature we calibrated the measured ρ to the value of ρ at the standard temperature of 25 c ρ was calibrated to the normalized temperature of 25 c as follows campbell et al 1948 6 ρ t ρ 25 1 α t 25 where ρt is ρ at temperature t ρ25 is ρ at t 25 c and α is the empirical coefficient usually equal to 0 025 c under these conditions the deviation of ρ was 2 5 because of the temperature deviation of 1 c to calculate the soil temperature at different soil depths the following model was derived musy and soutter 1991 7 t z t t mean a i r a 2 e z d sin w t φ z 4 d where t z t is the temperature on day t and at depth z tmean air is the yearly mean value of the air temperature a is the difference between the maximum and minimum air temperatures z is the soil depth d is the depth parameter of the model φ is the interval between the maximum and minimum temperature days and w is the frequency of the periodic variation p w 2π p where p 365 days from the 10 year 2006 2015 daily air temperature data recorded by seven meteorological stations the relative positions of the meteorological stations and research sites are shown in supplementary fig s1 we obtained the parameters tmean air a φ d and w of all sites supplementary tables s2 s4 supplementary fig s2 presents the simulation results for the soil temperature at different soil depths 2 4 regression analysis after the above analysis the actual ρ values with high sensitivity and resolution had to be screened out the actual ρ points were interpolated into the corresponding resolution raster data in this way 53 ρ profiles with relative horizontal distances and vertical depths could be obtained according to the relative positions of the access tubes and electrodes the ρ values at different soil depths were extracted to the corresponding positions of the access tubes after ρ quality control and inversion a total of 2769 data pairs were finally obtained to explore the relationship between ρ and θ and build the prediction models we selected linear and nonlinear equations to build models establishing for the relationship between ρ and θ the general linear regression equation is 8 θ α 1 ρ α 2 the general nonlinear regression equation is 9 θ m ρ α ε where α1 α2 and α are parameters of the equation ε is the error and m ρ α is the kernel mean function john fox 2002 the nls package in the program r was used to estimate the parameters as follows 10 s α θ m α ρ 2 where s α is the residual the solution with the minimum residual does not have a general formula unlike the linear least squares problem thus we used an iterative procedure starting with initial values for the parameters we needed to set the initial values for the parameters m ρ α by continuously changing these parameters to minimize the residual s α fox and weisberg 2010 we built four kinds of linear models based on different datasets 1 ρ data after logarithmic transformation 2 θ data after log transformation 3 both ρ and θ data after log transformation and 4 ρ and θ data without log transformation we selected four kinds of functions for the nonlinear m ρ α model cubic reciprocal exponential and power we randomly selected 80 of the datasets to build models and the remaining 20 to verify the accuracy of the models the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse between predicted and measured values of θ for 20 of the datasets were used to test the model accuracy as follows 11 r i 0 n m θ i m θ p θ i p θ m θ i m θ 2 p θ i p θ 2 where r is the correlation coefficient n is the number of test 20 datasets mθ i is the ith measured θ in these datasets pθ i is the ith predicted θ in these datasets and m θ and p θ are the sample means of the measured and predicted θ respectively for these datasets a higher square of the correlation coefficient indicates higher model accuracy we used the pearson correlation coefficient to test the relationship between ρ and θ the rmse was calculated as follows 12 rmse e p θ m θ 2 where e represents the formula for calculating the mean value a lower rmse indicates higher model accuracy the statistical evaluation of the results was improved by splitting the datasets 1000 times 80 of the total datasets comprised training data and the remaining 20 comprised testing data to generate the mean and standard deviation sd of the 1000 r 2 and rmse values 2 5 quantifying uncertainty and sensitivity of ert derived θ we used the international organization for standardization guides to the expression of uncertainty in measurement iso gum to evaluate uncertainty the steps to evaluate uncertainty are as follows chen et al 2018 despax et al 2016 θ is not measured directly but derived from ert the functional relationship is as follows 13 θ f ρ where f is the optimal model determined by the rmse and r2 values using eqs 8 11 identifying the uncertainty source for ert derived θ we estimated uncertainty using the following equation 14 u c θ θ ρ u ρ where uc θ is the combined standard uncertainty of the output quantity and u ρ is the standard uncertainty of the input quantity the uncertainty of the input quantity in this study was the uncertainty in ert measurements if the model resolution was calculated the uncertainty value can also be calculated simultaneously from the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix 15 j t j λ f 1 the mean value of uncertainty for all ert measurements was 9 8 with the minimum and the maximum value of 1 8 and 30 7 respectively only seven records had great uncertainty with high value more than 20 our field notes showed that all the seven records were set by a smaller electrode spacing 20 cm which may greatly increase the possibility of poor ground contact for a small number of electrodes and thus leading to a large uncertainty we used the standardized regression coefficient src sensitivity index to evaluate the influence of ρ on the model output i e θ the src function is integrated into the sensitivity package saltelli 2002 in the r program bouazizi et al 2019 introduced detailed computational processes for determining src sensitivity indicators the src index expresses the variance in θ due to variable ρ bouazizi et al 2019 all statistical analyses were performed with microsoft excel version 2013 spss version 22 0 or r version 3 3 3 the maps of the sample sites and ρ profiles were generated with gis software esri arcmap 10 3 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of ρ and θ under the various site conditions 3 1 1 soil texture table 2 indicates that θ ranges from 5 2 to 51 6 with a mean of 21 2 and ρ ranges from 13 2 to 271 9 ω m with a mean of 96 8 ω m moreover ρ and θ were highly variable and thus the obtained datasets may reflect the whole range of values in the loessial soil the soil textures at the sampling points were mainly silty clayey loam sicllo n 279 and silty loam silo n 2475 fig 4 and table 2 ρ differed significantly between sicllo and silo fig 5 a p 0 05 the average ρ was lower for sicllo 74 4 ω m than silo 99 1 ω m ρ decreased with increasing clay and silt contents uhlemann et al 2017 because ρ is substantially lower at high clay content owing to the additional matrix conduction caused by ion movement on the surface of clay particles gunn et al 2015 uhlemann et al 2017 consequently the soil particle composition had a significant impact on ρ and should be considered when building a model brillante et al 2014 an effective approach is to develop different models for different soil textures as the results for loam lo and sandy loam salo textures were not convincing because of the small sample sizes 9 and 6 respectively we did not build models for the lo and salo data silo had the largest sample size so we used the silo data for the following analysis 3 1 2 land use ρ differed significantly among cropland forest and grassland fig 5c and its frequency distribution for cropland differed considerably from the distributions for forest and grassland fig 6 the ρ values for cropland forest and grassland were centrally distributed at 0 50 90 120 and 120 280 ω m respectively the average ρ values were in the order of forest 165 1 ω m grassland 111 7 ω m cropland 30 2 ω m compared to grassland and forest cropland was characterized by a low ρ which was usually caused by poor compaction a good water regime and sparse root distribution archie 1942 rossi et al 2011 the average θ values were in the order of cropland 30 7 grassland 14 8 forest 13 4 this sequence is similar to the results of wang et al 2012 who obtained data across the entire clp θ depended strongly on land use because the root depth distribution photosynthesis and transpiration of plants shape the patterns of soil water in terms of both space and time wang et al 2015a 3 1 3 soil depth we divided the silo data into two groups soil depth 100 cm sd 100 n 880 and soil depth 100 cm sd 100 n 1595 this is because θ fluctuated considerably in the 0 100 cm layer but was more stable below 100 cm in the clp wang et al 2011 ρ and θ differed significantly between sd 100 and sd 100 p 0 05 fig 7 the median and mean ρ values were lower for sd 100 36 4 and 86 0 ω m respectively than for sd 100 137 1 and 122 7 ω m respectively in contrast the median and mean θ values were lower for sd 100 19 6 and 19 5 respectively than for sd 100 21 7 and 22 8 respectively shallow soil is characterized by strong evapotranspiration and the presence of numerous vegetation roots which may be why ρ was higher in shallow soil than in deep soil and θ was lower in shallow soil than in deep soil 3 1 4 dry and wet soil conditions establishing prediction models for θ under dry and wet soil conditions is important for hydrological modeling and soil water resource management it has been reported that 60 of the field capacity generally θ is 10 in the loess plateau based on soil texture is the upper limit of a dried soil layer wang et al 2010 wang et al 2018 θ 20 would mean a good soil water regime for plant growth on the clp in the current study we divided θ into three grades θ 10 n 629 10 θ 20 n 709 and θ 20 n 1431 the corresponding mean values of ρ were 169 5 126 5 and 50 1 ω m respectively table 3 the variability of ρ for the datasets was lower for dry soil than wet soil average cvs were 0 25 0 47 and 1 03 respectively θ was also less variable for dry soil than wet soil average cvs were 0 13 0 20 and 0 27 respectively although the differences were small under the dry condition the variabilities of ρ and θ differed slightly however the differences increased significantly when the soil was wet this agrees with existing studies al hagrey et al 2004 binley et al 2002 brunet et al 2010 cosenza et al 2006 calamita et al 2012 reported that the relationship between ρ and θ is linear if the ρ and θ variabilities are similar and nonlinear if the two variabilities differ considerably the sample sizes of cropland for θ 10 and grassland for θ 20 were 16 and 16 respectively so we did not build a corresponding model for these two datasets 3 2 regression models of the soil water content under different conditions all models n 64 performed acceptably under the various site conditions p 0 01 although the accuracy considerably differed cv 0 62 table 4 and supplementary tables s5 and fig s3 in case of soil texture the model accuracy was better for silo average r 2 0 6 than sicllo for silo almost all residuals fluctuated randomly around zero fig 8 however for sicllo there existed a trend in residual distribution therefore in soils with high clay content there was high uncertainty in ert derived θ in addition θ was more variable for silo cv 0 54 than for sicllo cv 0 35 which may account for the higher accuracy of the silo models compared to the sicllo models in terms of land use cropland had the highest average r 2 while forest and grassland had an average r 2 of 0 1 we could find a clear pattern of residuals for grassland and forest which may be explained by the different root patterns and water uptake traits between the two land uses when using ert to derive θ for forest or grassland root induced variation should be considered in building the model for the soil depth the model accuracy was higher for sd 100 r2 0 79 rmse 6 05 than for sd 100 r2 0 40 rmse 6 13 ρ and θ were more susceptible to the external environmental factors such as the root density rainfall infiltration and redistribution and animal and human activities in the surface soil the distribution of residuals for shallow soil still had an obvious trend fig 8 therefore for soil depths less than 1 m it is necessary to consider external environmental factors for building the transfer function model of θ supplementary fig s4 further indicates that the model accuracy depends on the grade of θ generally models performed better when θ 10 or θ 20 than when 10 θ 20 all models performed poorly at 10 θ 20 except for the forest model 3 3 uncertainty and sensitivity of ert derived θ the uncertainty of θ derived from ert varied with site conditions which was caused basically by a global uncertainty by using ert to project water content for all data the range of uncertainty was 0 2 14 1 95 confidence interval with a mean value of 2 3 the uncertainty of the first sampling area was large with a mean value of 4 1 topographically the first sampling area was divided into slope land and gully land for slope land the uncertainty associated with the electrode spacing of 0 2 m was greater than that of other electrode spacings see table 1 such an uncertainty which was 20 15 2 ωm mainly came from the global uncertainty resulting from abnormal contact between the electrodes and wires for gully land a high uncertainty was found when the electrode spacing was set to 5 m this uncertainty came from the model uncertainty this may be caused by the shallow groundwater level about 10 m on the gully land according to our field monitoring among different land uses the uncertainty of cropland 0 7 9 9 with a mean value of 4 3 was greater than that of forest 0 1 2 3 with a mean value of 0 7 and grassland 0 3 2 4 with a mean value of 1 4 for cropland the data with high uncertainty was distributed at the bottom for gully land in the first sampling area with a mean value of 4 5 and this uncertainty mainly came from model uncertainty for grassland the uncertainty associated with the electrode spacing of 5 m with a mean value of 1 9 was more than 0 5 m with a mean value of 0 7 and this uncertainty came from global uncertainty which was 11 11 4 ωm setting large electrode spacing may result in a lower resolution for forest the data with high uncertainty was distributed at the slope land in the first sampling area and associated with the electrode spacing of 0 2 m with a mean value of 1 5 and this uncertainty mainly came from global uncertainty which was 20 15 2 ωm as for soil texture the uncertainty of silo 0 2 14 4 with a mean value of 2 4 was greater than that of sicllo 0 4 1 7 with a mean value of 0 9 the sources of uncertainty for silo were similar to that for all other data in the first sampling area with great global uncertainty soil texture belongs to silo after removing these data the uncertainty of silo with a mean value of 0 7 was smaller than that of sicllo this uncertainty mainly came from model uncertainty hence we may further infer that there was a high model uncertainty in ert derived θ in soils with higher clay content in terms of soil depth the uncertainty of deep soil 0 4 7 9 with a mean value of 3 0 was greater than that of shallow soil 0 1 10 4 with a mean value of 1 1 we found that all the values for deep soil located at the bottom of the gully in the first sampling area showed high uncertainty with a mean value of 3 8 this further indicated that shallow groundwater produces high uncertainties in ert derived θ values sensitivity analysis further showed that ert derived θ values for cropland showed the lowest sensitivity to ρ compared with the other conditions fig 9 almost 95 of the cropland was located at the bottom of the gully land in the first sampling area this part of cropland was affected by shallow groundwater thus resulting in low sensitivity of ert derived θ 4 conclusions we measured 2769 pairs of ρ and θ data with ert and a neutron probe across the entire cz clp the average ρ differed significantly with land use soil texture and soil depth which significantly affected the relationship between ρ and θ the models based on sd 100 performed the best r 2 0 79 rmse 6 05 followed by those based on silo data r 2 0 70 and rmse 6 44 and all data the models based on the land use data performed poorly especially for forest r 2 0 06 rmse 6 34 however all models provided a significance level of 0 01 with acceptable performance levels the wet and dry soil conditions affected the model performance these new models are the first set of models based on field data across the cz clp and their relatively high performance level makes them applicable for measuring different soil parameters in the clp region and possibly other similar regions around the world credit authorship contribution statement hui sun formal analysis

5252,as the important part of carbon cycle research riverine dissolved inorganic carbon dic has attracted continuous attentions for its close relationship with global climate change in order to investigate the dominant factors of dissolved inorganic carbon species and its stable carbon isotopic signals in large watershed under base flow condition 81 river water samples were collected in the xijiang river during the dry season in 2015 the elemental ratios in river water revealed the hydro chemistry in xijiang river were mainly controlled by the carbonate weathering the characteristics of the most samples were the high dic concentrations and narrow range of δ13cdic which can be interpreted as the result of chemical weathering under open system based on the simulated calculation of soil respiration and mineral dissolution the relatively lower dic concentrations and δ13cdic values have been observed in tributaries draining silicate terrains this result may be controlled both by the mineral dissolution and co2 outgassing most samples had the over saturated pco2 levels compared to the atmosphere the respiratory quotient rq demonstrated that high pco2 values were not from the biologic respiration instead the groundwater influx with the high soil pco2 increased pco2 level in river waters the co2 concentration gradient between river water and atmosphere caused a violent co2 outgassing accompanied isotope fractionation the outgassing significantly dropped the pco2 in river water and caused an enrichment of c13 in dic based on the theoretical calculation and previous observation the negative correlation between the δ13cdic and pco2 in river water was caused by the co2 outgassing additionally the isotope exchange between the dic and atmosphere co2 can also partially increase the riverine co2 this study examined the impacts of soil respiration minerals dissolution and co2 outgassing on dic and δ13cdic and found that the riverine δ13cdic is probably not reflect the mixing of source signals such as soil co2 and carbonate instead it is mainly controlled by the fractionation in minerals dissolution and co2 outgassing keywords major ions carbon isotope chemical weathering co2 outgassing xijiang river 1 introduction river as the important carrier for inland matters constitutes the important lateral and vertical conduit in the global carbon cycle which links the continental atmospheric and oceanic c pools and can affect the global climate change and earth s energy budget meybeck 1987 regnier et al 2013 richey et al 2002 the high pco2 level in river water in compared with that in atmosphere causes the co2 outgassing from river water to atmosphere duvert et al 2018 raymond et al 2013 richey et al 2002 yao et al 2007 the co2 evasion from rivers and streams is estimated 1 8 pg c per year with large uncertain raymond et al 2013 while the total riverine carbon flux is about 1 pg c petagrams of carbon per year among which the dissolved inorganic carbon dic is the important component and constitutes approximately 0 43 pg per year marx et al 2017 meybeck 1987 suchet et al 2003 riverine dic including hco3 co3 2 h2co3 and aqueous co2 is mostly derived from chemical weathering marx et al 2017 the interaction between the weathering and atmospheric co2 level drives the climate change over geological time scales berner et al 1983 dessert et al 2003 goddéris et al 2003 the chemical weathering as the main sink of atmospheric co2 must be considered differently with respect to time frame in less than 100 000 years the atmosphere co2 are closely related to weathering of all lithologies however on the million years scales the co2 consumed by carbonate weathering will return to the atmosphere thus carbonate weathering has thus no effect on atmospheric co2 in geologic time the weathering of na and k silicate minerals also have limited effect on the atmospheric co2 because of the reverse weathering reactions in seawater leading to the formation of na and k silicates and releasing co2 back to the atmosphere while weathering reactions of ca and mg silicates converting the atmosphere co2 to hco3 and precipitated as carbonate minerals in the ocean berner et al 1983 gaillardet et al 1999 martin 2017 thus the researches including the origin transformation and transport on riverine dic flux can help better understand the chemical weathering processes furthermore the global carbon cycle most dic originates from the soil respiration co2 are controlled by both natural and anthropogenic processes 1 chemical weathering the silicate and carbonate rocks dissolution will consume co2 and generate the dic clark and fritz 1997 2 the biological effects including the soil respiration the riverine photosynthesis and respiration processes catalán et al 2016 porcal et al 2015 3 the human perturbation such as the land use change and the sewage inputs barnes and raymond 2009 perrin et al 2008 regnier et al 2013 4 water air co2 exchange and the co2 outgassing deirmendjian and abril 2018 doctor et al 2008 polsenaere and abril 2012 yao et al 2007 5 the hydrology geology and climate qin et al 2020 qin et al 2019 white and blum 1995 to better understand sources of dic the stable isotope composition of dic δ13cdic is widely used in previous studies barth et al 2003 cartwright 2010 li et al 2010a van geldern et al 2015 yao et al 2007 the soil respiration generates the high co2 concentration in the soil profile marfia et al 2004 marx et al 2017 the δ13c of the respiration related co2 inherits that of plants and predominated by the c3 photosynthetic cycles in most terrestrial ecosystems clark and fritz 1997 the c3 pathway lead to the low δ13c values of c3 plants and soil respiration co2 24 to 30 because of the depletion in 13c during photosynthetic uptake of co2 clark and fritz 1997 the infiltrating water will dissolve soil co2 and enable to react with the rocks in general this reaction is controlled by the flow rate mineral surface area water saturation and soil co2 levels maher 2011 winnick and maher 2018 during the mineral dissolution both the ph dic concentrations and δ13c will be significantly changed previous studies suggest the δ13cdic can reveals this dissolution processes barth et al 2003 li et al 2010a li et al 2008 qin et al 2019 van geldern et al 2015 the generated δ13cdic are dominated by the mass isotope balance between the carbonate minerals and soil co2 or the isotope exchange between the soil co2 and soil dic for example if the carbonate is dissolved by the soil co2 in saturation zone the δ13cdic will be the average values between the δ13c of soil co2 and carbonate minerals 0 which derives a simple mixing model based on the distinct isotopic composition of soil co2 and carbonate minerals to quantify the contributions of different sources to the riverine dic however whether the δ13cdic signals observed in river water can exactly preserve the information during chemical weathering demands a careful consideration because when the groundwater or soil influx discharged into river water always have a remarkably high pco2 level compared with that in atmosphere boano et al 2014 deirmendjian and abril 2018 doctor et al 2008 the co2 outgassing driven by the gas concentration gradient will cause a strong diffusion which can changed the δ13cdic and dic concentrations all these geochemical processes cause the considerable controversy of predominate factors of the dic and δ13cdic in river water the connections of dic and δ13cdic evolutions between soil profile mineral dissolution and co2 outgassing should be established which has not been systematically examined in previous studies the study area xijiang river basin is characterized by its typical karst landform and is one of hot research spots in china liu and han 2020a liu et al 2020 zeng et al 2020 zeng and han 2020 to our knowledge the previous studies examined the different channel and sub watershed of xijiang river basin few studies have systematically investigated the dic flux and its isotope composition of the whole river basin including different channels and tributaries our study conducted an extensive sampling which collected main channel of xijiang river and its 42 tributaries in the dry season we conducted a basin wide analysis of major ions and δ13cdic of xijiang watershed and aimed to investigate the dominant factors on dic concentrations and δ13cdic under the base flow condition we threaded the dic and δ13cdic evolution during the soil respiration mineral dissolution and co2 degassing by the theoretical model the high dic concentrations and wide range of δ13cdic revealed the dominance of carbonate dissolution under open system and co2 degassing the dic evolution may provide a positive feedback to atmospheric co2 level and global temperature increasing which calls further and scrupulous studies 2 material and methods 2 1 study area geographical and hydrological descriptions of the xijiang river basin were reported in detail by previous studies han et al 2018 liu and han 2020a in short the xijiang river is the largest tributary of zhujiang river accounting for 80 of the zhujiang river basin which is the second largest river water system in china and has a drainage area of 4 5 105 km2 21 31 26 49 n 102 14 e 115 53 e xu and han 2009 the xijiang river originates from the yunnan guizhou plateau in china flows through four provinces and discharges into the south china sea in zhujiang river delta xu and liu 2007 the annual water discharge of xijiang river is about 3 4 1011 m3 zhen et al 2016 the mean precipitation rate of xijiang river basin ranges between 1200 and 2200 mm year and the annual mean air temperature varies from 14 c to 22 c zhen et al 2016 under the control of a subtropical monsoon climate only a small proportion of rainfall 20 occurs in the dry season from october to march han et al 2018 as illustrated in fig 1 the xijiang river can be divided into six main section the nanpanjiang river the beipanjiang river and the hongshuihe river constitutes the upper reaches of xijiang river while the qianjiang river the xunjiang river and xijiang river are the lower reaches both the main channel of zhujiang river and the river near the estuary of zhujiang river delta are called xijiang river the division of the river system into two sections is based on the lithologic and topographical characteristics the upper reaches of xijiang river mainly flow through the permian and triassic carbonate rocks including sulfide rich limestones and dolomites the karst topography is well developed with an area about 155 000 km2 which accounts for 45 of the total watershed han et al 2018 and the typical landscapes such as caves sinkholes and subterranean conduits are highly developing in subterranean system the territory is mountains and hills with the altitude variaing from 200 to 2000 m while the lower reaches of xijiang river drain precambrian metamorphic rocks gneiss and magmatic rocks granite the territory is fairly flat with the altitude ranging between 0 and 80 m liu and han 2020a the detail hydrologic data of xijiang river can be found in pearl river water resources commission of the ministry of water resources http www zwswj com zwsw2011 asp syqxx main syqxx asp woodland is the dominant land use type in zhujiang river basin which accounts for 63 4 of the total area followed by cropland and grassland 22 9 and 7 1 respectively while the built up land water bodies and un used land take up less than 10 of total area hu and batunacun 2018 the economic conditions are distinct between the upper reaches and lower reaches the lower reaches mainly drain guangdong province which has more developed economy than the upper reaches flowing through guizhou province the urbanization rates are 69 9 in guangdong province while 46 in guizhou province the primary industry is more developed in the upper reaches there are 100 000 legal entities are engaged in primary industry by contrast the number is 37 000 in the lower reaches liu and han 2020a the data suggest the agriculture is more developed in the upper reaches on the contrary the urbanization is more developed in the lower reaches li et al 2010b xu and han 2009 2 2 sampling strategies 81 river water samples were collected in xijiang river in january 2015 during the dry season the geographical locations of sampling sites are showed in fig 1 and the data of longitude and latitude in were recorded by the global positioning system supplementary table 1 the sampling sites cover the main channel and 42 tributaries of xijiang river the water samples were collected under a depth about 15 cm from the center of the river from bridges and ferries the pre cleaned polyethylene and glass bottles used to store samples were rinsed with corresponding sample waters before collecting in natural weathering system the relative length of the fluid residence time and reaction rate determines whether the chemical weathering can reach the thermodynamic equilibrium which is referred to transport limited weathering maher 2011 the widespread observation suggests the riverine solute fluxed are controlled by this thermodynamic equilibrium with a low run off godsey et al 2009 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 moon et al 2014 our samples were collected during the dry season outside the monsoon the rivers are mostly supplied by the shallow groundwater with the longer fluid residence time indicating the chemical weathering in xijiang river basin during the dry season is probably under thermodynamic rather than kinetic controls the samples collecting in the dry season provide an opportunity to investigate the carbon cycling in karst territory under thermodynamic equilibrium which can help understand the essence of the carbon processes and transporting chemical weathering in the wet season may affected by the kinetic control and the relationship between the dic concentrations and isotopic signals may be covered so in this study the data and analyses were conducted based on the dry season condition the seasonal variations still need the further studies the physical chemical parameters of river water such as water temperature t electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do were immediately determined in situ by a multi parameter meter multiline 3320 wtw weilheim upper bavaria germany the ph value was measured by a ph meter with a precision of 0 01ph the ph meter was calibrated against buffering solutions of ph of 6 86 and 9 18 hco3 were titrated by hcl in the field all of the samples for δ13cdic analysis were immediately filtered through a pre cleaned 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter membrane kept in the polyethylene bottles with air tight caps and added hgcl2 to prevent biological activity the river samples for ions analysis were filtered through a pre cleaned 0 22 μm membrane millipore in the field and stored in the polyethylene bottles then the samples for cation analysis were acidified with high purity hno3 to ph less than 2 all the containers were sealed and kept refrigerated at about 4 until further analysis 2 3 analytical procedures the concentrations of cations na k ca2 mg2 and anions cl no3 so4 2 were measured by an ion chromatograph ics 900 dionex sunnyvale usa in the institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research cas reference blank and replicate samples were employed to check the accuracy of all the analysis the relative standard deviations of all the analysis were within 5 si contents were measured by spectrophotometry employing silicon molybdenum colorimetry the determination of carbon stable isotope using the modified method atekwana and krishnamurthy 1998 was described in previous studies han et al 2010 li et al 2008 the syringes were used to inject 10 ml each sample into glass bottles which had magnetic stir bars and 1 ml 85 phosphoric acid the dic were converted as co2 by the chemical reaction the co2 was extracted into a vacuum line and then pass through the n2 cooled ethanol trap to separated h2o finally the co2 was transferred cryogenically into a tube for isotope measurement the carbon isotope ratios of dic were measured by the finigan mat 252 mass spectrometer and reported by the δ notation relative to pdb in per mil as follows 1 δ 13 c r sample r pdb 1 1000 the standards nbs19 gbw04416 gbw04417 for c isotope were measured to check the accuracy of all the analysis the results were within the recommended values the precision of δ13c were within 0 2 all the analysis results are listed in the supplementary table 1 2 4 dic calculation the relative proportions of dissolved inorganic carbon species including hco3 co3 2 h2co3 and aqueous co2 are closely related to ph value and water temperature clark and fritz 1997 the equilibrium between inorganic carbon species and atmosphere co2 can be described by following equations 2 co2 h2o h2co3 h hco3 2h co3 2 3 k co2 h2co3 p c o 2 10 7 10 5 t 2 0 016 t 1 11 4 k 1 h hco3 h2co3 10 1 1 10 4 t 2 0 012 t 6 58 5 k 2 h co3 2 hco3 10 9 10 5 t 2 0 0137 t 10 62 where h2co3 is the sum of aqueous co2 and the carbonic acid h2co3 ki are temperature dependant dissociation constants between dic species clark and fritz 1997 thus the partial pressure of carbon dioxide pco2 h2co3 and co3 2 can be calculated by using the hco3 water temperature ph measured in the field the calculation procedure is represented as following 6 pco 2 h2co3 k co2 10 p h hco3 k co2 k 1 7 h2co3 10 p h hco3 k 1 8 co3 2 k 2 hco3 10 p h the calculation result is listed in the supplementary table 1 h2co3 and co3 2 only account for less than 5 in most sampling sites so do not listed in the table because of the precision of ph measurement 0 01ph therelativeuncertainty of the calculated pco2 is about 3 the calcite saturation index csi of river water were calculated by phreeqc program and are shown in supplementary table 1 the excess pco2 epco2 as the multiplicative factor express the pco2 in river water in comparison with that of the atmosphere doctor et al 2008 a value of epco2 of 10 means the pco2 in water sample is 10 times higher than that of the atmosphere the epco2 can be represented by the equations 9 e p c o 2 p c o 2 sample p c o 2 atmosphere where the pco2 atmosphere used in the calculation is 400 ppm 3 results 3 1 chemical compositions of river waters the hydrochemical data of xijiang river were listed in supplementary table 1 the ph values in main channel decreased along the flow direction fig 2 varying from 7 3 to 8 5 with a mean value of 7 9 while in the tributaries ph values ranged between 7 0 and 8 7 averaged 7 9 indicating the xijiang river water system is slightly alkaline for most sampling sites the dissolved oxygen do level was below saturation and the average do value was 93 do did not show clearly spatial distribution along the flow direction fig 2 except the sample collected in source area the partial pressures of co2 pco2 in xijiang river water were above the atmospheric level 400 ppm the pco2 increased along the flow direction the average pco2 in xijiang river system was 1833 ppm lower than the global average value 3100 ppm raymond et al 2013 the normalized inorganic charge balance nicb were less than 10 the slight imbalance may result from the organic complex matters gaillardet et al 1997 the major ions compositions were showed in the anion and cation ternary diagrams fig 3 it is clear that the riverine cations were dominated by ca2 which accounts for more than 50 of the total cations followed by na k and then mg2 the samples collected in the main channels defined a narrow range on ternary figures some samples collected in tributaries located in the lower reaches draining silicate terrains shown a relatively higher proportion of na k the bicarbonate hco3 was the dominant anion in xijiang river accounting for 70 of the total anions in main channels the dic concentrations varied from 1 41 to 4 06 mmol l in the mainstream with the mean value of 2 55 mmol l and median value of 2 46 mmol l respectively the calculated csi varied from 1 78 to 1 63 with a mean value of 0 36 and median value of 0 44 respectively indicating most sampling sites were close to saturation or are slightly supersaturated with respect to calcite so4 2 was the second major ions in river waters previous studies li et al 2008 liu and han 2020a indicate that the atmospheric inputs and oxidation of sulfide pyrite are the main sources of riverine so4 2 the concentrations of si presented a clear spatial distribution it differed significantly between the upper reaches and lower reaches of xijiang river the mean concentrations of si in the lower reaches 0 12 mmol l was nearly twice as that in the upper reaches 0 20 mmol l and in nanpanjiang river located in carbonate terrain karst topography it exhibited an obviously low level varying from 10 μmol l to 81 μmol l the non carbonate alkalinity nc alk including nitrogen phosphors silicate and organic species may affect the ta dic values hunt et al 2011 the dissolved inorganic nitrogen din was contributed by no3 and dissolved phosphorus 10 μmol l and dissolved silicate 0 15 mmol l in xijiang river exhibited small concentrations compared to the ta values 2 55 mol l our previous study presented the dissolved organic carbon doc ranged from 80 μmol l to 1100 μmol l with an average value of 400 μmol l assuming the nc alk representing 36 of doc concentration hunt et al 2011 li et al 2012 the doc will contribute 5 of ta further previous studies suggest when ph 7 4 the nc alk could be neglected hunt et al 2011 li et al 2012 thus in this study the ta values were assumed all from carbonate considering the lithologic distributions in xijiang river basin the major ions compositions indicates the rock weathering play an important role on the chemical compositions of river waters 3 2 δ13c of dic in river water the δ13c of dic in the main channel exhibited a narrow range varying from 11 5 to 8 1 with a mean value of 9 6 the mean δ13cdic in the upper reaches 9 5 was slightly higher than that in the lower reaches 10 1 fig 2d the δ13cdic in tributaries ranged from 19 8 to 2 1 with a mean value of 10 4 and median value of 10 1 respectively the δ13cdic values observed in the mainstream are similar as that reported by the previous studies in different channel of xijiang river water li et al 2010a li et al 2008 qin et al 2020 qin et al 2019 the wide range of δ13cdic values observed in tributaries indicate the complexity of the hydrochemistry 3 3 principal component analysis the principal component analysis pca as a descending dimension algorithm is a common statistical method it uses several unrelated variables to replace the complex raw data and extract the components with the eigenvalues more than 1 wang et al 2017 the result of pca analysis was showed in table 1 the principal components pc contained 79 76 and 70 01 of the total variance to the main channel and tributaries respectively in the tributaries pc 1 had the clear positive loading on ca2 mg2 hco3 indicating it should be attributed to the carbonate weathering contributions because carbonate weathering will transport abundant ca2 mg2 hco3 in to river waters and significantly increase the concentrations gaillardet et al 1999 additionally the positive loading on so4 2 demonstrated that h2so4 may participate in the weathering processes pc 2 had the clear positive loading on na k and cl the potential sources of these ions are anthropogenic inputs including the domestic sewage agricultural activities and industrial sewage chetelat et al 2008 xu and liu 2007 thus pc 2 can be attribute to anthropogenic inputs in the main channel pc 1 had significantly positive loading on ca2 mg2 k cl no3 and hco3 while pc 2 had clear positive loading on so4 2 it is difficult to distinguish the significance of these two pcs because these ions have completely different sources for example ca2 mg2 and hco3 are close related to chemical weathering and free from human perturbation while the sources of na k so4 2 no3 are relatively complex chetelat et al 2008 gaillardet et al 1999 moon et al 2007 the result of pca suggest the absolute concentrations of ions in the main channel can t well represent the characteristics of sources which are covered by mixing processes and dilution effect to examine the mixing relationship between different sources and eliminate the dilution effect the δ13cdic and elemental ratios were employed in the next discussion 4 discussions 4 1 major ions and chemical weathering gaillardet et al 1999 systematic collected the compiled date of solutes in 60 world largest rivers significant relationships between elemental ratios ca2 na versus mg2 na and ca2 na versus hco3 na were observed in rivers draining different lithology these ratios in river water can reflect the elemental ratios in different local bedrock and solubility of corresponding elements during chemical weathering the end member of silicates and carbonates were determined by small rivers flowing through mono lithology gaillardet et al 1999 for most world rivers these ratios are distributed between the end members which represents a conservative mixing between the weathering products fig 4 the samples of xijiang river are plotted between the assumed silicate end members and carbonate end members fig 4 indicating a primary control of chemical weathering on major ions compared with other large rivers the samples collected in xijiang river significantly approach to the carbonate end member this result suggests the carbonate weathering predominates in xijiang river basin which is consistent with the previous studies that employed the forward and inverse methods to estimate the relative contributions of different sources to riverine cations in xijiang river basin gaillardet et al 1999 li et al 2008 xu and han 2009 in fact the much fast dissolution kinetics of carbonate compared to the silicate allows a high proportion of carbonate dissolution even with a small amount of carbonate existing tipper et al 2006 white et al 1999 besides xijiang river basin is characterized by its widely distributed carbonate terrains considering the participation of h2so4 in mineral dissolution the equivalent ratio between ca2 mg2 hco3 and so4 2 hco3 are plotted to reveal the rock dissolution process in detail the potential processes are summarized as follow liu and han 2020b eq 10 15 10 ca x mg 1 x co 3 h 2 o co 2 xca 2 1 x mg 2 2 hco 3 11 2 na x k 1 x alsi 3 o 8 h 2 co 3 2 na 2 1 x k 2 hco 3 6 sio 2 2 alooh 12 caal 2

so 4 2na 2 1 x k so 4 2 6sio 2 2alooh according to the stoichiometry if caxmg 1 x co3 or caalsi2o8 are dissolved only by the h2co3 the generated hco3 are derived from both the minerals and weathering agents thus the ca2 mg2 hco3 should be equivalent to 1 meanwhile the contributions of h2so4 hno3 to dissolution should be limited so4 2 hco3 ratios should be close 0 if caxmg 1 x co3 are dissolved only by the h2so4 or hno3 the ca2 mg2 hco3 are equal to 2 so4 2 hco3 ratios should be close to 1 or 0 respectively analogously the end members of naalsi3o8 and caso4 gypsum dissolution can also be plotted fig 5 our previous study found the contribution of gypsum dissolution is limited by using s o isotope data liu and han 2020a the elemental ratios of xijiang river water indicate that the mineral dissolution process in xijiang river basin was completed both by the h2co3 and h2so4 this result is also congruous with the local geological background sulfide rich deposits are widely distributed in the study area our previous study revealed the oxidation of pyrite is the major source of the riverine so4 2 liu and han 2020a the oxidation of pyrite could abundant h which will then facilitate in the mineral dissolution and increase the riverine dic flux martin 2017 4 2 evolution of dic and δ13cdic 4 2 1 soil respiration soil respiration is the initial step of dic and δ13cdic evolution because the respired co2 undergo gas diffusion will then participate in chemical weathering barth et al 2003 polsenaere et al 2013 both the concentrations and δ13c of soil co2 are controlled by the soil respiration our previous study investigated the δ13c of riverine poc and the local plants and find that δ13c values of most local plants are concentrated from 26 to 24 li et al 2008 within in the range of typical c3 plants from 30 to 24 clark and fritz 1997 thus in this study the local δ13c of plants is assumed 25 the δ13c of soil respired co2 produced by root autotrophic respiration and heterotrophic decomposition of soil carbon are much the same as plant itself clark and fritz 1997 the high concentrations of the soil co2 1000 and 100 000 μatm in comparison with that in atmosphere marx et al 2017 drives a gas diffusion from soil to the atmosphere which will then alter vertical distribution of the concentrations and isotopic composition of soil co2 the model given by cerling 1984 based on the fick s second law indicates that the depth δ13c of soil respired co2 and soil respiration rate are the dominant factors as eqs 16 18 cerling 1984 16 c s φ d s lz z 2 2 c 0 17 δ s 1 r pdb φ d s lz z 2 2 d s d s β δ φ c 0 δ a φ d s lz z 2 2 1 d s d s β δ φ c 0 1 δ a 1 1000 18 δ i δ i 1000 1 r pdb 1 r pdb δ i 1000 1 where all the parameters are defined in cerling 1984 according to the calculation the diffusional fractionation for the underlying soil co2 varies from 4 4 to 6 when the soil respiration rate varies from 2 to 20 mmol m 2 hr 1 thus the initial state of soil co2 participate in the mineral dissolution can be defined this initial state is undeniably altered by recharging groundwater however this effect is relatively limited even with the high recharging rate and low respiration rate solomon and cerling 1987 considering the global database of mean annual soil respiration 0 20 mmol m 2 hr 1 bond lamberty and thomson 2010 2 and 20 mmol m 2 hr 1 are assumed as the lower limit and upper limit of soil respiration respectively under the condition that local δ13c of plants is average 25 the initial state of ph dic concentrations and δ13cdic can be calculated and shown in fig 6 the infiltrating water dissolved soil co2 constituting acidic solutions and then participatein the mineral dissolution 4 2 2 mineral dissolution the dissolution reactions are showed in eq 10 15 during the reaction processing the ph dic concentrations and δ13cdic will continuously change the degree of openness between the groundwater and soil atmosphere dominates this evolution the open system condition means a constant supply of soil co2 which is typical in unsaturated zone while close system condition represents groundwater is close off from the source of soil co2 the evolution of dic δ13cdic during mineral dissolution under different systems are exhibited in fig 6 under open system the high and constant co2 level permits more amount of minerals dissolved the dic concentrations will be significantly higher compared with closed system while the δ13cdic is always higher under close system evolution although the difference of δ13cdic between open system and closed system is relatively limited 1 2 the controlling factors of these two condition are distinct in open system the δ13cdic are controlled by the equilibrium fractionation exchange between soil co2 and dic final δ13cdic will be enriched about 8 9 compared to its initial state whether the minerals are carbonate or silicate while in closed system the mass balance between minerals and the initial dic contents dominates the δ13cdic for carbonate dissolution the final δ13cdic will be enriched about 10 which represents a roughly 1 1 mass mixture between initial δ13cdic and δ13c of the carbonate 0 for silicate dissolution the δ13cdic will maintain unchanged for no carbon containing materials added into the system in fact whether the open and closed system is hypothetical ideal conditions the partially open system which the mineral dissolution start under open system and is completed under close system is the most typical condition clark and fritz 1997 the evolution under partially open system is also shown in fig 6 the final concentrations of dic and δ13cdic values are between the open condition and closed condition and depend on when the open system are converted into close system the ph and dic concentrations of xijiang river are plotted in fig 6 the characteristic of most samples are high ph and dic concentrations if completed under closed conditions the dissolution will not generate the observed high dic concentrations even with the realistically high pco2 values calculated from the observed highest respiration rate 20 mmol m 2 hr 1 moreover the pco2 in groundwater collected in xijiang river basin is much higher than that in river waters indicating a relatively adequate co2 li et al 2010a qin et al 2020 qin et al 2019 these results suggest that the mineral dissolution is probable completed under open or partially open system previous study suggest that the karst topography have a fast infiltration rate and might be assigned as closed system clark and fritz 1997 however the typical landscape such as caves sinkholes and highly develop in subterranean system of xijiang river basin li et al 2010a these structures generate different water and solute transport path bakalowicz 2005 during the dry season the slow diffusion and infiltration though the soil and matrix in unsaturated zone provide the opportunity for gas and aqueous phases coexist which is the requirement of open condition trček 2006 the plotting between δ13cdic and ca2 mg2 hco3 also indicates the chemical weathering is mainly completed under open condition in fact besides dissolved by co2 h2co3 the carbonate dissolution can also be completed by h2so4 and hno3 δ13cdic should inherit that in carbonate minerals 0 although silicate dissolution by h2so4 and hno3 is also possible to occur the dissolution will not affect the dic concentrations and δ13cdic thus this condition is neglected the ratio between δ13cdic and ca2 mg2 hco3 do not exhibit clear mixing relationships as the plotting between ca2 mg2 hco3 and so4 2 hco3 which indicates the a predominant control of carbonate weathering completed by co2 and h2so4 on water chemistry fig 7 the δ13cdic of most samples have relatively narrow range although these δ13cdic values are close to the end member that carbonate dissolved by co2 under closed systems the dispersed ca2 mg2 hco3 values can t be explained by closed systems evolution which should have a relatively fixed ca2 mg2 hco3 ratio the high dic concentrations observed in both river water and ground water indicate a high co2 level which is characteristic of open system evolution the δ13cdic signals of carbonate minerals dissolved by h2so4 and hno3 0 are not observed in this study because these fluxes equilibrate with the adequate soil co2 during infiltration the δ13cdic are altered by the equilibrium fractionation exchange between soil co2 and dic finally will reach equilibrium value under open system conditions as a consequence the carbonate dissolution in xijiang river basin is probably under open system evolution in the lower reaches of xijiang river with the silicate lithology most tributaries do not present the typical δ13cdic value under closed system evolution 24 on the contrary the δ13cdic values are not different from that of main channel and tributaries flowing through carbonate terrain the dic concentrations of these tributaries also exhibit a relatively low level although the characteristic of δ13cdic values and dic concentrations can be interpreted by the open system evolution barth et al 2003 it is not the only possibility some in stream processes can also shift the δ13cdic dic concentrations and ph 4 3 in stream processes 4 3 1 aquatic biologic effect the riverine dic and its c isotopic compositions are mainly affected by 1 influx of soil co2 2 biologic effect such as bio degradation respiration and photosynthesis in river waters 3 co2 outgassing processes porcal et al 2015 yao et al 2007 zhang et al 2009 the pco2 values in xijiang river basin were higher than the atmospheric pco2 level in general the respiration of phytoplankton and thedecompositionof organic matters can improve the riverine pco2 however butman and raymond 2011 suggests only 4 of the total co2 outgassing originates from the in stream biologic processes butman and raymond 2011 hotchkiss et al 2015 found the contribution of in stream processes to total co2 outgassing varies from 14 for small rivers to 39 to large rivers hotchkiss et al 2015 respiration or and degradation is always accompanied by the consumption of o2 anderson 1995 sondergaard and middelboe 1995 do did not show clearly relationship with pco2 and δ13cdic in xijiang river water an simple calculation respiratory quotient rq δco2 δo2 was employed in this study taylor et al 2003 the theoretical rq value including planktonic respiration and aquatic metabolism range between the 0 61 and 0 97 robinson et al 1999 taylor et al 2003 while samples of xijiang river have the rq ratios much higher than 1 the recent study qin et al 2020 also suggest the low dissolved organic carbon concentrations can t significantly affect the dic contents in xijiang river system by 2 years high frequency monitoring of doc dic and δ13cdic the in stream respiration will lead to an enrichment of c12 in dic wang et al 2011 which have not been observed in xijiang river basin if the δ13cdic values that is from chemical weathering and have not undergo in stream processes serve as baseline 12 to 10 only few samples had the δ13cdic values below it on the contrary δ13cdic values of most samples are even slightly higher than the baseline 12 to 8 consequently both the pco2 and δ13cdic suggest the in stream biologic processes do not cause the high pco2 level in the study area recent study shows the degradation rate of doc dissolved organic matters are controlled by water retention time in river water the short retention time in river water causes fast organic carbon decay rate catalán et al 2016 the high rainfall can bring more terrestrially organic carbon into river water and then affect the riverine c flux through organic carbon decomposition bianchi et al 2013 our sampling was conducted during the base flow season this effect was not observed in this study to understand the seasonal variation and biologic effect on riverine carbon flux more studies are needed to describe the full picture of carbon cycle 4 3 2 co2 outgassing the gas diffusion is driven by the concentration difference between a gas in river water and atmosphere water air the diffusive gas flux f is typically expressed as eq 4 19 f g water air k where k is the gas transfer velocity which is dominated by turbulent dissipation rate cole et al 2007 zappa et al 2007 the different mass related diffusion coefficient of c12o2 and c13o2 drives diffusional fractionation during co2 outgassing the fractionation lead to an enrichment of c13 in the remaining dic due to the faster diffusion coefficient of c12o2 in addition the equilibrium exchange fractionation between the dic and atmospheric co2 are also considered as potential reason for the increasing δ13cdic in river waters aucour et al 1999 cartwright 2010 however if there exists violent co2 outgassing δ13cdic will be primarily controlled by diffusional fractionation because the gas evasion continuously alters the statue of the system which is hard to reach the chemical equilibrium doctor et al 2008 recent studies found that pco2 increase dramatically in the headwater or the zone with groundwater influx and then large proportions of dic contents are lost to the atmosphere within several kilometers or even hundred meters boano et al 2014 deirmendjian and abril 2018 doctor et al 2008 this process is always accompanied by a violent diffusional fractionation deirmendjian and abril 2018 the co2 degas model given by polsenaere and abril 2012 is employed to describe this fractionation this model suits river water with ph ranged from 4 6 to 7 2 where co2 inputs outputs conservatively affect the co2 pool the kinetic fractionation shift both pco2 δ13cdic and ph in river water several potential conditions are shown in fig 8 from an initial pco2 of 10 1 5μatm ta which is assumed to equal with hco3 in this study of 1 8 mmol l lowest concentrations in main channel and 2 8 mmol l mean concentrations in main channel the initial ph and δ13cdic are calculated by the open system evolution the final states are determined by the ph value at 7 2 solid arrow in fig 8 the fractionation shifts the δ13cdic 2 which approaches the estimated value 1 8 based on the predominance of carbonate weathering and high ta values polsenaere and abril 2012 apparently when ph reaches 7 2 the pco2 level in river water is still far exceed that in atmosphere indicating the presence of diffusion at a higher ph the kinetic fractionation occurs in both the kinetic diffusion of co2 between the river water air interface and the conversion between the carbonate species doctor et al 2008 observed an exponential liner relationship existing between the δ13cdic and lnepco2 with a slope of 2 3 to 2 4 with a wide ph range dotted arrow the shift of δ13cdic and lnepco2 using co2 degas model seems accord with the field observation slope when carbonate weathering predominates and ph 7 2 this result may denote that whatever ph the carbonate mineral dissolution finally reaches the co2 outgassing will lead to an approximately linger relationship between δ13cdic and lnepco2 thus a rough fractionation line can be drawn which describes the variation of δ13cdic and pco2 during co2 outgassing except some samples collected in tributaries located in silicate terrains most samples in main channel are broadly distributed along the assumed fractionation line with a slight deviation this slight deviation may result from errors derived from the estimation of δ13cdic in soil respiration and mineral dissolution the δ13cdic values increase with the pco2 decrease indicating the significant effect of fractionation on riverine δ13cdic the samples collected in tributaries located in silicate terrains own relatively lower δ13cdic and pco2 levels and are far from above fractionation line δ13cdic derived from silicate weathering under closed system is more affected by the diffusional fractionation from pco2 of 10 2 3 to 10 1 75 ta of 0 58 mmol l lowest concentrations observed in tributaries when ph reaches 7 2 the shift of δ13cdic will be 4 7 analogously the subsequent fractionation will further increase δ13cdic while decrease the pco2 dotted arrow in fig 8 some samples with the lower δ13cdic and pco2 levels are closed to the assumed fractionation line this reveals that silicate mineral dissolution is probably under closed conditions besides the diffusional fractionation the isotopic exchange between the riverine dic and atmosphere also contributes the increasing of riverine δ13cdic given by aucour et al 1999 the change of δ13cdic can be expressed as a function of time by δ 13 c dic δ 13 c a ε δ 13 c a ε δ 13 c dic 0 e k c eq h d i c t where δ13ca and δ13cdic 0 yield the δ13c of atmospheric co2 8 and initial dic respectively ε represents the fractionation between co2 and hco3 9 k is the gas transfer velocity cm h h is the mean depth of the river for a k of 8 12 cm h h of 2 3 m starting with a δ13cdic 0 of 11 dic 2 3 mmol l raymond et al 2012 respectively it would take more than 15 days to shift the δ13cdic about 1 2 though limited isotopic exchange between the riverine dic and atmosphere can also partially increase the riverine δ13cdic in large watershed after the dic flux add in to river water the diffusion driven by co2 concentration gradient between river water and atmosphere shift the δ13cdic ph and pco2 levels when the dic mainly from carbonate weathering fractionation of δ13cdic is relatively small while the high co2 level inheriting from groundwater drops quickly a negative relationship between the δ13cdic and pco2 can be observed which can interpret the characteristics of δ13cdic and pco2 patterns in the main channel of xijiang river water the observed spatial distributions of ph and pco2 fig 2 probably result from the continuously soil groundwater influx with lower ph and high pco2 values and co2 outgassing the distinct hydrogeochemical and isotopic data between the upper reaches and lower reaches indicates they act differently in controlling carbon cycling processing and transporting though there is widespread silicate terrain in the lower reaches the main source of dic in the mainstream of xijiang river is from carbonate weathering occurring in the upper reaches as evidenced by the dominance of ca2 mg2 and hco3 the high ph and dic values in the upper reaches reveal the mineral dissolution occurring under the open system δ13cdic in the upper reaches reflects the exchange fractionation during mineral dissolution while in the lower reaches the silicate weathering products with low ph and low dic concentrations discharge in to the river water thus both the ph and dic concentrations exhibited relatively lower values compared to the upper reaches the co2 outgassing continuously occurs and cause the diffusional fractionation the diffusion enriches the 13c in riverine dic and decrease the pco2 along the flow direction thus carbon cycling and transporting in xijiang river are controlled by the lithologic difference between the upper reaches and lower reaches the corresponding mineral dissolution processes and co2 outgassing 5 conclusions and implications in this study the systematic data of major ions δ13cdic in xijiang river basin involving the main channel and 42 tributaries during the dry season were presented the predominance of major ions has been determined through stoichiometry and statistical method the evolution of dic and δ13cdic from soil respiration mineral dissolution and co2 outgassing have been presented quantitatively the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the hydro chemistry in the xijiang river basin is mainly predominated by the carbonate weathering while some tributaries in the lower reaches are controlled by the silicate weathering chemical weathering is mainly completed by the soil co2 h2so4 also take part in the mineral dissolution as indicated by the relationships between ca2 mg2 hco3 and so4 2 hco3 2 the high dic concentrations and pco2 level reveal the mineral dissolution is probably completed under open or partly open condition because closed system evolution can not generate the high dic concentrations observed in xijiang river water even with possible highest soil respiration rate the signals of δ13cdic also support the dissolution is completed under open or partly open condition dic derived from chemical weathering completed by co2 and h2so4 exhibits similar δ13cdic values it reveals the equilibrium fractionation exchange between soil co2 and dic controls the δ13cdic values 3 the high pco2 level in river water compared to that in atmosphere is caused by the soil influx input the co2 concentration gradient drives a co2 diffusion from river water to atmosphere which significantly decreases the pco2 level and cause a diffusional fractionation the fractionation lead to an enrichment of c13 in the remaining dic δ13cdic exhibits a negative relationship between pco2 as previous studies observed 4 this study advances a new interpretation of riverine δ13cdic the direct implication is that δ13cdic in river water cannot be simply explained as the sources mixing and employed to quantify the relative proportions of carbonate and silicate minerals dissolution because both the mineral dissolution and co2 outgassing can easily shift the δ13cdic signals inherited from the soil co2 or carbonate this study suggests that δ13cdic is supposed to trace the geochemical processes i e co2 outgassing mineral dissolution rather than represent the signals of sources the further implication is the interaction between the global climate change and the above evolution the increasing temperatures will promote soil respiration dic evolution may provide a positive feedback to atmospheric co2 level and global climate change credit authorship contribution statement jinke liu

5252,as the important part of carbon cycle research riverine dissolved inorganic carbon dic has attracted continuous attentions for its close relationship with global climate change in order to investigate the dominant factors of dissolved inorganic carbon species and its stable carbon isotopic signals in large watershed under base flow condition 81 river water samples were collected in the xijiang river during the dry season in 2015 the elemental ratios in river water revealed the hydro chemistry in xijiang river were mainly controlled by the carbonate weathering the characteristics of the most samples were the high dic concentrations and narrow range of δ13cdic which can be interpreted as the result of chemical weathering under open system based on the simulated calculation of soil respiration and mineral dissolution the relatively lower dic concentrations and δ13cdic values have been observed in tributaries draining silicate terrains this result may be controlled both by the mineral dissolution and co2 outgassing most samples had the over saturated pco2 levels compared to the atmosphere the respiratory quotient rq demonstrated that high pco2 values were not from the biologic respiration instead the groundwater influx with the high soil pco2 increased pco2 level in river waters the co2 concentration gradient between river water and atmosphere caused a violent co2 outgassing accompanied isotope fractionation the outgassing significantly dropped the pco2 in river water and caused an enrichment of c13 in dic based on the theoretical calculation and previous observation the negative correlation between the δ13cdic and pco2 in river water was caused by the co2 outgassing additionally the isotope exchange between the dic and atmosphere co2 can also partially increase the riverine co2 this study examined the impacts of soil respiration minerals dissolution and co2 outgassing on dic and δ13cdic and found that the riverine δ13cdic is probably not reflect the mixing of source signals such as soil co2 and carbonate instead it is mainly controlled by the fractionation in minerals dissolution and co2 outgassing keywords major ions carbon isotope chemical weathering co2 outgassing xijiang river 1 introduction river as the important carrier for inland matters constitutes the important lateral and vertical conduit in the global carbon cycle which links the continental atmospheric and oceanic c pools and can affect the global climate change and earth s energy budget meybeck 1987 regnier et al 2013 richey et al 2002 the high pco2 level in river water in compared with that in atmosphere causes the co2 outgassing from river water to atmosphere duvert et al 2018 raymond et al 2013 richey et al 2002 yao et al 2007 the co2 evasion from rivers and streams is estimated 1 8 pg c per year with large uncertain raymond et al 2013 while the total riverine carbon flux is about 1 pg c petagrams of carbon per year among which the dissolved inorganic carbon dic is the important component and constitutes approximately 0 43 pg per year marx et al 2017 meybeck 1987 suchet et al 2003 riverine dic including hco3 co3 2 h2co3 and aqueous co2 is mostly derived from chemical weathering marx et al 2017 the interaction between the weathering and atmospheric co2 level drives the climate change over geological time scales berner et al 1983 dessert et al 2003 goddéris et al 2003 the chemical weathering as the main sink of atmospheric co2 must be considered differently with respect to time frame in less than 100 000 years the atmosphere co2 are closely related to weathering of all lithologies however on the million years scales the co2 consumed by carbonate weathering will return to the atmosphere thus carbonate weathering has thus no effect on atmospheric co2 in geologic time the weathering of na and k silicate minerals also have limited effect on the atmospheric co2 because of the reverse weathering reactions in seawater leading to the formation of na and k silicates and releasing co2 back to the atmosphere while weathering reactions of ca and mg silicates converting the atmosphere co2 to hco3 and precipitated as carbonate minerals in the ocean berner et al 1983 gaillardet et al 1999 martin 2017 thus the researches including the origin transformation and transport on riverine dic flux can help better understand the chemical weathering processes furthermore the global carbon cycle most dic originates from the soil respiration co2 are controlled by both natural and anthropogenic processes 1 chemical weathering the silicate and carbonate rocks dissolution will consume co2 and generate the dic clark and fritz 1997 2 the biological effects including the soil respiration the riverine photosynthesis and respiration processes catalán et al 2016 porcal et al 2015 3 the human perturbation such as the land use change and the sewage inputs barnes and raymond 2009 perrin et al 2008 regnier et al 2013 4 water air co2 exchange and the co2 outgassing deirmendjian and abril 2018 doctor et al 2008 polsenaere and abril 2012 yao et al 2007 5 the hydrology geology and climate qin et al 2020 qin et al 2019 white and blum 1995 to better understand sources of dic the stable isotope composition of dic δ13cdic is widely used in previous studies barth et al 2003 cartwright 2010 li et al 2010a van geldern et al 2015 yao et al 2007 the soil respiration generates the high co2 concentration in the soil profile marfia et al 2004 marx et al 2017 the δ13c of the respiration related co2 inherits that of plants and predominated by the c3 photosynthetic cycles in most terrestrial ecosystems clark and fritz 1997 the c3 pathway lead to the low δ13c values of c3 plants and soil respiration co2 24 to 30 because of the depletion in 13c during photosynthetic uptake of co2 clark and fritz 1997 the infiltrating water will dissolve soil co2 and enable to react with the rocks in general this reaction is controlled by the flow rate mineral surface area water saturation and soil co2 levels maher 2011 winnick and maher 2018 during the mineral dissolution both the ph dic concentrations and δ13c will be significantly changed previous studies suggest the δ13cdic can reveals this dissolution processes barth et al 2003 li et al 2010a li et al 2008 qin et al 2019 van geldern et al 2015 the generated δ13cdic are dominated by the mass isotope balance between the carbonate minerals and soil co2 or the isotope exchange between the soil co2 and soil dic for example if the carbonate is dissolved by the soil co2 in saturation zone the δ13cdic will be the average values between the δ13c of soil co2 and carbonate minerals 0 which derives a simple mixing model based on the distinct isotopic composition of soil co2 and carbonate minerals to quantify the contributions of different sources to the riverine dic however whether the δ13cdic signals observed in river water can exactly preserve the information during chemical weathering demands a careful consideration because when the groundwater or soil influx discharged into river water always have a remarkably high pco2 level compared with that in atmosphere boano et al 2014 deirmendjian and abril 2018 doctor et al 2008 the co2 outgassing driven by the gas concentration gradient will cause a strong diffusion which can changed the δ13cdic and dic concentrations all these geochemical processes cause the considerable controversy of predominate factors of the dic and δ13cdic in river water the connections of dic and δ13cdic evolutions between soil profile mineral dissolution and co2 outgassing should be established which has not been systematically examined in previous studies the study area xijiang river basin is characterized by its typical karst landform and is one of hot research spots in china liu and han 2020a liu et al 2020 zeng et al 2020 zeng and han 2020 to our knowledge the previous studies examined the different channel and sub watershed of xijiang river basin few studies have systematically investigated the dic flux and its isotope composition of the whole river basin including different channels and tributaries our study conducted an extensive sampling which collected main channel of xijiang river and its 42 tributaries in the dry season we conducted a basin wide analysis of major ions and δ13cdic of xijiang watershed and aimed to investigate the dominant factors on dic concentrations and δ13cdic under the base flow condition we threaded the dic and δ13cdic evolution during the soil respiration mineral dissolution and co2 degassing by the theoretical model the high dic concentrations and wide range of δ13cdic revealed the dominance of carbonate dissolution under open system and co2 degassing the dic evolution may provide a positive feedback to atmospheric co2 level and global temperature increasing which calls further and scrupulous studies 2 material and methods 2 1 study area geographical and hydrological descriptions of the xijiang river basin were reported in detail by previous studies han et al 2018 liu and han 2020a in short the xijiang river is the largest tributary of zhujiang river accounting for 80 of the zhujiang river basin which is the second largest river water system in china and has a drainage area of 4 5 105 km2 21 31 26 49 n 102 14 e 115 53 e xu and han 2009 the xijiang river originates from the yunnan guizhou plateau in china flows through four provinces and discharges into the south china sea in zhujiang river delta xu and liu 2007 the annual water discharge of xijiang river is about 3 4 1011 m3 zhen et al 2016 the mean precipitation rate of xijiang river basin ranges between 1200 and 2200 mm year and the annual mean air temperature varies from 14 c to 22 c zhen et al 2016 under the control of a subtropical monsoon climate only a small proportion of rainfall 20 occurs in the dry season from october to march han et al 2018 as illustrated in fig 1 the xijiang river can be divided into six main section the nanpanjiang river the beipanjiang river and the hongshuihe river constitutes the upper reaches of xijiang river while the qianjiang river the xunjiang river and xijiang river are the lower reaches both the main channel of zhujiang river and the river near the estuary of zhujiang river delta are called xijiang river the division of the river system into two sections is based on the lithologic and topographical characteristics the upper reaches of xijiang river mainly flow through the permian and triassic carbonate rocks including sulfide rich limestones and dolomites the karst topography is well developed with an area about 155 000 km2 which accounts for 45 of the total watershed han et al 2018 and the typical landscapes such as caves sinkholes and subterranean conduits are highly developing in subterranean system the territory is mountains and hills with the altitude variaing from 200 to 2000 m while the lower reaches of xijiang river drain precambrian metamorphic rocks gneiss and magmatic rocks granite the territory is fairly flat with the altitude ranging between 0 and 80 m liu and han 2020a the detail hydrologic data of xijiang river can be found in pearl river water resources commission of the ministry of water resources http www zwswj com zwsw2011 asp syqxx main syqxx asp woodland is the dominant land use type in zhujiang river basin which accounts for 63 4 of the total area followed by cropland and grassland 22 9 and 7 1 respectively while the built up land water bodies and un used land take up less than 10 of total area hu and batunacun 2018 the economic conditions are distinct between the upper reaches and lower reaches the lower reaches mainly drain guangdong province which has more developed economy than the upper reaches flowing through guizhou province the urbanization rates are 69 9 in guangdong province while 46 in guizhou province the primary industry is more developed in the upper reaches there are 100 000 legal entities are engaged in primary industry by contrast the number is 37 000 in the lower reaches liu and han 2020a the data suggest the agriculture is more developed in the upper reaches on the contrary the urbanization is more developed in the lower reaches li et al 2010b xu and han 2009 2 2 sampling strategies 81 river water samples were collected in xijiang river in january 2015 during the dry season the geographical locations of sampling sites are showed in fig 1 and the data of longitude and latitude in were recorded by the global positioning system supplementary table 1 the sampling sites cover the main channel and 42 tributaries of xijiang river the water samples were collected under a depth about 15 cm from the center of the river from bridges and ferries the pre cleaned polyethylene and glass bottles used to store samples were rinsed with corresponding sample waters before collecting in natural weathering system the relative length of the fluid residence time and reaction rate determines whether the chemical weathering can reach the thermodynamic equilibrium which is referred to transport limited weathering maher 2011 the widespread observation suggests the riverine solute fluxed are controlled by this thermodynamic equilibrium with a low run off godsey et al 2009 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 moon et al 2014 our samples were collected during the dry season outside the monsoon the rivers are mostly supplied by the shallow groundwater with the longer fluid residence time indicating the chemical weathering in xijiang river basin during the dry season is probably under thermodynamic rather than kinetic controls the samples collecting in the dry season provide an opportunity to investigate the carbon cycling in karst territory under thermodynamic equilibrium which can help understand the essence of the carbon processes and transporting chemical weathering in the wet season may affected by the kinetic control and the relationship between the dic concentrations and isotopic signals may be covered so in this study the data and analyses were conducted based on the dry season condition the seasonal variations still need the further studies the physical chemical parameters of river water such as water temperature t electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do were immediately determined in situ by a multi parameter meter multiline 3320 wtw weilheim upper bavaria germany the ph value was measured by a ph meter with a precision of 0 01ph the ph meter was calibrated against buffering solutions of ph of 6 86 and 9 18 hco3 were titrated by hcl in the field all of the samples for δ13cdic analysis were immediately filtered through a pre cleaned 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter membrane kept in the polyethylene bottles with air tight caps and added hgcl2 to prevent biological activity the river samples for ions analysis were filtered through a pre cleaned 0 22 μm membrane millipore in the field and stored in the polyethylene bottles then the samples for cation analysis were acidified with high purity hno3 to ph less than 2 all the containers were sealed and kept refrigerated at about 4 until further analysis 2 3 analytical procedures the concentrations of cations na k ca2 mg2 and anions cl no3 so4 2 were measured by an ion chromatograph ics 900 dionex sunnyvale usa in the institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research cas reference blank and replicate samples were employed to check the accuracy of all the analysis the relative standard deviations of all the analysis were within 5 si contents were measured by spectrophotometry employing silicon molybdenum colorimetry the determination of carbon stable isotope using the modified method atekwana and krishnamurthy 1998 was described in previous studies han et al 2010 li et al 2008 the syringes were used to inject 10 ml each sample into glass bottles which had magnetic stir bars and 1 ml 85 phosphoric acid the dic were converted as co2 by the chemical reaction the co2 was extracted into a vacuum line and then pass through the n2 cooled ethanol trap to separated h2o finally the co2 was transferred cryogenically into a tube for isotope measurement the carbon isotope ratios of dic were measured by the finigan mat 252 mass spectrometer and reported by the δ notation relative to pdb in per mil as follows 1 δ 13 c r sample r pdb 1 1000 the standards nbs19 gbw04416 gbw04417 for c isotope were measured to check the accuracy of all the analysis the results were within the recommended values the precision of δ13c were within 0 2 all the analysis results are listed in the supplementary table 1 2 4 dic calculation the relative proportions of dissolved inorganic carbon species including hco3 co3 2 h2co3 and aqueous co2 are closely related to ph value and water temperature clark and fritz 1997 the equilibrium between inorganic carbon species and atmosphere co2 can be described by following equations 2 co2 h2o h2co3 h hco3 2h co3 2 3 k co2 h2co3 p c o 2 10 7 10 5 t 2 0 016 t 1 11 4 k 1 h hco3 h2co3 10 1 1 10 4 t 2 0 012 t 6 58 5 k 2 h co3 2 hco3 10 9 10 5 t 2 0 0137 t 10 62 where h2co3 is the sum of aqueous co2 and the carbonic acid h2co3 ki are temperature dependant dissociation constants between dic species clark and fritz 1997 thus the partial pressure of carbon dioxide pco2 h2co3 and co3 2 can be calculated by using the hco3 water temperature ph measured in the field the calculation procedure is represented as following 6 pco 2 h2co3 k co2 10 p h hco3 k co2 k 1 7 h2co3 10 p h hco3 k 1 8 co3 2 k 2 hco3 10 p h the calculation result is listed in the supplementary table 1 h2co3 and co3 2 only account for less than 5 in most sampling sites so do not listed in the table because of the precision of ph measurement 0 01ph therelativeuncertainty of the calculated pco2 is about 3 the calcite saturation index csi of river water were calculated by phreeqc program and are shown in supplementary table 1 the excess pco2 epco2 as the multiplicative factor express the pco2 in river water in comparison with that of the atmosphere doctor et al 2008 a value of epco2 of 10 means the pco2 in water sample is 10 times higher than that of the atmosphere the epco2 can be represented by the equations 9 e p c o 2 p c o 2 sample p c o 2 atmosphere where the pco2 atmosphere used in the calculation is 400 ppm 3 results 3 1 chemical compositions of river waters the hydrochemical data of xijiang river were listed in supplementary table 1 the ph values in main channel decreased along the flow direction fig 2 varying from 7 3 to 8 5 with a mean value of 7 9 while in the tributaries ph values ranged between 7 0 and 8 7 averaged 7 9 indicating the xijiang river water system is slightly alkaline for most sampling sites the dissolved oxygen do level was below saturation and the average do value was 93 do did not show clearly spatial distribution along the flow direction fig 2 except the sample collected in source area the partial pressures of co2 pco2 in xijiang river water were above the atmospheric level 400 ppm the pco2 increased along the flow direction the average pco2 in xijiang river system was 1833 ppm lower than the global average value 3100 ppm raymond et al 2013 the normalized inorganic charge balance nicb were less than 10 the slight imbalance may result from the organic complex matters gaillardet et al 1997 the major ions compositions were showed in the anion and cation ternary diagrams fig 3 it is clear that the riverine cations were dominated by ca2 which accounts for more than 50 of the total cations followed by na k and then mg2 the samples collected in the main channels defined a narrow range on ternary figures some samples collected in tributaries located in the lower reaches draining silicate terrains shown a relatively higher proportion of na k the bicarbonate hco3 was the dominant anion in xijiang river accounting for 70 of the total anions in main channels the dic concentrations varied from 1 41 to 4 06 mmol l in the mainstream with the mean value of 2 55 mmol l and median value of 2 46 mmol l respectively the calculated csi varied from 1 78 to 1 63 with a mean value of 0 36 and median value of 0 44 respectively indicating most sampling sites were close to saturation or are slightly supersaturated with respect to calcite so4 2 was the second major ions in river waters previous studies li et al 2008 liu and han 2020a indicate that the atmospheric inputs and oxidation of sulfide pyrite are the main sources of riverine so4 2 the concentrations of si presented a clear spatial distribution it differed significantly between the upper reaches and lower reaches of xijiang river the mean concentrations of si in the lower reaches 0 12 mmol l was nearly twice as that in the upper reaches 0 20 mmol l and in nanpanjiang river located in carbonate terrain karst topography it exhibited an obviously low level varying from 10 μmol l to 81 μmol l the non carbonate alkalinity nc alk including nitrogen phosphors silicate and organic species may affect the ta dic values hunt et al 2011 the dissolved inorganic nitrogen din was contributed by no3 and dissolved phosphorus 10 μmol l and dissolved silicate 0 15 mmol l in xijiang river exhibited small concentrations compared to the ta values 2 55 mol l our previous study presented the dissolved organic carbon doc ranged from 80 μmol l to 1100 μmol l with an average value of 400 μmol l assuming the nc alk representing 36 of doc concentration hunt et al 2011 li et al 2012 the doc will contribute 5 of ta further previous studies suggest when ph 7 4 the nc alk could be neglected hunt et al 2011 li et al 2012 thus in this study the ta values were assumed all from carbonate considering the lithologic distributions in xijiang river basin the major ions compositions indicates the rock weathering play an important role on the chemical compositions of river waters 3 2 δ13c of dic in river water the δ13c of dic in the main channel exhibited a narrow range varying from 11 5 to 8 1 with a mean value of 9 6 the mean δ13cdic in the upper reaches 9 5 was slightly higher than that in the lower reaches 10 1 fig 2d the δ13cdic in tributaries ranged from 19 8 to 2 1 with a mean value of 10 4 and median value of 10 1 respectively the δ13cdic values observed in the mainstream are similar as that reported by the previous studies in different channel of xijiang river water li et al 2010a li et al 2008 qin et al 2020 qin et al 2019 the wide range of δ13cdic values observed in tributaries indicate the complexity of the hydrochemistry 3 3 principal component analysis the principal component analysis pca as a descending dimension algorithm is a common statistical method it uses several unrelated variables to replace the complex raw data and extract the components with the eigenvalues more than 1 wang et al 2017 the result of pca analysis was showed in table 1 the principal components pc contained 79 76 and 70 01 of the total variance to the main channel and tributaries respectively in the tributaries pc 1 had the clear positive loading on ca2 mg2 hco3 indicating it should be attributed to the carbonate weathering contributions because carbonate weathering will transport abundant ca2 mg2 hco3 in to river waters and significantly increase the concentrations gaillardet et al 1999 additionally the positive loading on so4 2 demonstrated that h2so4 may participate in the weathering processes pc 2 had the clear positive loading on na k and cl the potential sources of these ions are anthropogenic inputs including the domestic sewage agricultural activities and industrial sewage chetelat et al 2008 xu and liu 2007 thus pc 2 can be attribute to anthropogenic inputs in the main channel pc 1 had significantly positive loading on ca2 mg2 k cl no3 and hco3 while pc 2 had clear positive loading on so4 2 it is difficult to distinguish the significance of these two pcs because these ions have completely different sources for example ca2 mg2 and hco3 are close related to chemical weathering and free from human perturbation while the sources of na k so4 2 no3 are relatively complex chetelat et al 2008 gaillardet et al 1999 moon et al 2007 the result of pca suggest the absolute concentrations of ions in the main channel can t well represent the characteristics of sources which are covered by mixing processes and dilution effect to examine the mixing relationship between different sources and eliminate the dilution effect the δ13cdic and elemental ratios were employed in the next discussion 4 discussions 4 1 major ions and chemical weathering gaillardet et al 1999 systematic collected the compiled date of solutes in 60 world largest rivers significant relationships between elemental ratios ca2 na versus mg2 na and ca2 na versus hco3 na were observed in rivers draining different lithology these ratios in river water can reflect the elemental ratios in different local bedrock and solubility of corresponding elements during chemical weathering the end member of silicates and carbonates were determined by small rivers flowing through mono lithology gaillardet et al 1999 for most world rivers these ratios are distributed between the end members which represents a conservative mixing between the weathering products fig 4 the samples of xijiang river are plotted between the assumed silicate end members and carbonate end members fig 4 indicating a primary control of chemical weathering on major ions compared with other large rivers the samples collected in xijiang river significantly approach to the carbonate end member this result suggests the carbonate weathering predominates in xijiang river basin which is consistent with the previous studies that employed the forward and inverse methods to estimate the relative contributions of different sources to riverine cations in xijiang river basin gaillardet et al 1999 li et al 2008 xu and han 2009 in fact the much fast dissolution kinetics of carbonate compared to the silicate allows a high proportion of carbonate dissolution even with a small amount of carbonate existing tipper et al 2006 white et al 1999 besides xijiang river basin is characterized by its widely distributed carbonate terrains considering the participation of h2so4 in mineral dissolution the equivalent ratio between ca2 mg2 hco3 and so4 2 hco3 are plotted to reveal the rock dissolution process in detail the potential processes are summarized as follow liu and han 2020b eq 10 15 10 ca x mg 1 x co 3 h 2 o co 2 xca 2 1 x mg 2 2 hco 3 11 2 na x k 1 x alsi 3 o 8 h 2 co 3 2 na 2 1 x k 2 hco 3 6 sio 2 2 alooh 12 caal 2 si 2 o 8 h 2 co 3 ca 2 2 hco 3 2 sio 2 2 alooh 13 2 caxmg 1 x co 3 h 2 so 4 2 xca 2 2 1 x mg 2 2 hco3 so4 2 14 caxmg 1 x al2si2o8 h2so4 xca 2 1 x mg 2 so4 2 2sio2 2alooh 15 2na x k 1 x alsi 3 o 8 h 2 so 4 2na 2 1 x k so 4 2 6sio 2 2alooh according to the stoichiometry if caxmg 1 x co3 or caalsi2o8 are dissolved only by the h2co3 the generated hco3 are derived from both the minerals and weathering agents thus the ca2 mg2 hco3 should be equivalent to 1 meanwhile the contributions of h2so4 hno3 to dissolution should be limited so4 2 hco3 ratios should be close 0 if caxmg 1 x co3 are dissolved only by the h2so4 or hno3 the ca2 mg2 hco3 are equal to 2 so4 2 hco3 ratios should be close to 1 or 0 respectively analogously the end members of naalsi3o8 and caso4 gypsum dissolution can also be plotted fig 5 our previous study found the contribution of gypsum dissolution is limited by using s o isotope data liu and han 2020a the elemental ratios of xijiang river water indicate that the mineral dissolution process in xijiang river basin was completed both by the h2co3 and h2so4 this result is also congruous with the local geological background sulfide rich deposits are widely distributed in the study area our previous study revealed the oxidation of pyrite is the major source of the riverine so4 2 liu and han 2020a the oxidation of pyrite could abundant h which will then facilitate in the mineral dissolution and increase the riverine dic flux martin 2017 4 2 evolution of dic and δ13cdic 4 2 1 soil respiration soil respiration is the initial step of dic and δ13cdic evolution because the respired co2 undergo gas diffusion will then participate in chemical weathering barth et al 2003 polsenaere et al 2013 both the concentrations and δ13c of soil co2 are controlled by the soil respiration our previous study investigated the δ13c of riverine poc and the local plants and find that δ13c values of most local plants are concentrated from 26 to 24 li et al 2008 within in the range of typical c3 plants from 30 to 24 clark and fritz 1997 thus in this study the local δ13c of plants is assumed 25 the δ13c of soil respired co2 produced by root autotrophic respiration and heterotrophic decomposition of soil carbon are much the same as plant itself clark and fritz 1997 the high concentrations of the soil co2 1000 and 100 000 μatm in comparison with that in atmosphere marx et al 2017 drives a gas diffusion from soil to the atmosphere which will then alter vertical distribution of the concentrations and isotopic composition of soil co2 the model given by cerling 1984 based on the fick s second law indicates that the depth δ13c of soil respired co2 and soil respiration rate are the dominant factors as eqs 16 18 cerling 1984 16 c s φ d s lz z 2 2 c 0 17 δ s 1 r pdb φ d s lz z 2 2 d s d s β δ φ c 0 δ a φ d s lz z 2 2 1 d s d s β δ φ c 0 1 δ a 1 1000 18 δ i δ i 1000 1 r pdb 1 r pdb δ i 1000 1 where all the parameters are defined in cerling 1984 according to the calculation the diffusional fractionation for the underlying soil co2 varies from 4 4 to 6 when the soil respiration rate varies from 2 to 20 mmol m 2 hr 1 thus the initial state of soil co2 participate in the mineral dissolution can be defined this initial state is undeniably altered by recharging groundwater however this effect is relatively limited even with the high recharging rate and low respiration rate solomon and cerling 1987 considering the global database of mean annual soil respiration 0 20 mmol m 2 hr 1 bond lamberty and thomson 2010 2 and 20 mmol m 2 hr 1 are assumed as the lower limit and upper limit of soil respiration respectively under the condition that local δ13c of plants is average 25 the initial state of ph dic concentrations and δ13cdic can be calculated and shown in fig 6 the infiltrating water dissolved soil co2 constituting acidic solutions and then participatein the mineral dissolution 4 2 2 mineral dissolution the dissolution reactions are showed in eq 10 15 during the reaction processing the ph dic concentrations and δ13cdic will continuously change the degree of openness between the groundwater and soil atmosphere dominates this evolution the open system condition means a constant supply of soil co2 which is typical in unsaturated zone while close system condition represents groundwater is close off from the source of soil co2 the evolution of dic δ13cdic during mineral dissolution under different systems are exhibited in fig 6 under open system the high and constant co2 level permits more amount of minerals dissolved the dic concentrations will be significantly higher compared with closed system while the δ13cdic is always higher under close system evolution although the difference of δ13cdic between open system and closed system is relatively limited 1 2 the controlling factors of these two condition are distinct in open system the δ13cdic are controlled by the equilibrium fractionation exchange between soil co2 and dic final δ13cdic will be enriched about 8 9 compared to its initial state whether the minerals are carbonate or silicate while in closed system the mass balance between minerals and the initial dic contents dominates the δ13cdic for carbonate dissolution the final δ13cdic will be enriched about 10 which represents a roughly 1 1 mass mixture between initial δ13cdic and δ13c of the carbonate 0 for silicate dissolution the δ13cdic will maintain unchanged for no carbon containing materials added into the system in fact whether the open and closed system is hypothetical ideal conditions the partially open system which the mineral dissolution start under open system and is completed under close system is the most typical condition clark and fritz 1997 the evolution under partially open system is also shown in fig 6 the final concentrations of dic and δ13cdic values are between the open condition and closed condition and depend on when the open system are converted into close system the ph and dic concentrations of xijiang river are plotted in fig 6 the characteristic of most samples are high ph and dic concentrations if completed under closed conditions the dissolution will not generate the observed high dic concentrations even with the realistically high pco2 values calculated from the observed highest respiration rate 20 mmol m 2 hr 1 moreover the pco2 in groundwater collected in xijiang river basin is much higher than that in river waters indicating a relatively adequate co2 li et al 2010a qin et al 2020 qin et al 2019 these results suggest that the mineral dissolution is probable completed under open or partially open system previous study suggest that the karst topography have a fast infiltration rate and might be assigned as closed system clark and fritz 1997 however the typical landscape such as caves sinkholes and highly develop in subterranean system of xijiang river basin li et al 2010a these structures generate different water and solute transport path bakalowicz 2005 during the dry season the slow diffusion and infiltration though the soil and matrix in unsaturated zone provide the opportunity for gas and aqueous phases coexist which is the requirement of open condition trček 2006 the plotting between δ13cdic and ca2 mg2 hco3 also indicates the chemical weathering is mainly completed under open condition in fact besides dissolved by co2 h2co3 the carbonate dissolution can also be completed by h2so4 and hno3 δ13cdic should inherit that in carbonate minerals 0 although silicate dissolution by h2so4 and hno3 is also possible to occur the dissolution will not affect the dic concentrations and δ13cdic thus this condition is neglected the ratio between δ13cdic and ca2 mg2 hco3 do not exhibit clear mixing relationships as the plotting between ca2 mg2 hco3 and so4 2 hco3 which indicates the a predominant control of carbonate weathering completed by co2 and h2so4 on water chemistry fig 7 the δ13cdic of most samples have relatively narrow range although these δ13cdic values are close to the end member that carbonate dissolved by co2 under closed systems the dispersed ca2 mg2 hco3 values can t be explained by closed systems evolution which should have a relatively fixed ca2 mg2 hco3 ratio the high dic concentrations observed in both river water and ground water indicate a high co2 level which is characteristic of open system evolution the δ13cdic signals of carbonate minerals dissolved by h2so4 and hno3 0 are not observed in this study because these fluxes equilibrate with the adequate soil co2 during infiltration the δ13cdic are altered by the equilibrium fractionation exchange between soil co2 and dic finally will reach equilibrium value under open system conditions as a consequence the carbonate dissolution in xijiang river basin is probably under open system evolution in the lower reaches of xijiang river with the silicate lithology most tributaries do not present the typical δ13cdic value under closed system evolution 24 on the contrary the δ13cdic values are not different from that of main channel and tributaries flowing through carbonate terrain the dic concentrations of these tributaries also exhibit a relatively low level although the characteristic of δ13cdic values and dic concentrations can be interpreted by the open system evolution barth et al 2003 it is not the only possibility some in stream processes can also shift the δ13cdic dic concentrations and ph 4 3 in stream processes 4 3 1 aquatic biologic effect the riverine dic and its c isotopic compositions are mainly affected by 1 influx of soil co2 2 biologic effect such as bio degradation respiration and photosynthesis in river waters 3 co2 outgassing processes porcal et al 2015 yao et al 2007 zhang et al 2009 the pco2 values in xijiang river basin were higher than the atmospheric pco2 level in general the respiration of phytoplankton and thedecompositionof organic matters can improve the riverine pco2 however butman and raymond 2011 suggests only 4 of the total co2 outgassing originates from the in stream biologic processes butman and raymond 2011 hotchkiss et al 2015 found the contribution of in stream processes to total co2 outgassing varies from 14 for small rivers to 39 to large rivers hotchkiss et al 2015 respiration or and degradation is always accompanied by the consumption of o2 anderson 1995 sondergaard and middelboe 1995 do did not show clearly relationship with pco2 and δ13cdic in xijiang river water an simple calculation respiratory quotient rq δco2 δo2 was employed in this study taylor et al 2003 the theoretical rq value including planktonic respiration and aquatic metabolism range between the 0 61 and 0 97 robinson et al 1999 taylor et al 2003 while samples of xijiang river have the rq ratios much higher than 1 the recent study qin et al 2020 also suggest the low dissolved organic carbon concentrations can t significantly affect the dic contents in xijiang river system by 2 years high frequency monitoring of doc dic and δ13cdic the in stream respiration will lead to an enrichment of c12 in dic wang et al 2011 which have not been observed in xijiang river basin if the δ13cdic values that is from chemical weathering and have not undergo in stream processes serve as baseline 12 to 10 only few samples had the δ13cdic values below it on the contrary δ13cdic values of most samples are even slightly higher than the baseline 12 to 8 consequently both the pco2 and δ13cdic suggest the in stream biologic processes do not cause the high pco2 level in the study area recent study shows the degradation rate of doc dissolved organic matters are controlled by water retention time in river water the short retention time in river water causes fast organic carbon decay rate catalán et al 2016 the high rainfall can bring more terrestrially organic carbon into river water and then affect the riverine c flux through organic carbon decomposition bianchi et al 2013 our sampling was conducted during the base flow season this effect was not observed in this study to understand the seasonal variation and biologic effect on riverine carbon flux more studies are needed to describe the full picture of carbon cycle 4 3 2 co2 outgassing the gas diffusion is driven by the concentration difference between a gas in river water and atmosphere water air the diffusive gas flux f is typically expressed as eq 4 19 f g water air k where k is the gas transfer velocity which is dominated by turbulent dissipation rate cole et al 2007 zappa et al 2007 the different mass related diffusion coefficient of c12o2 and c13o2 drives diffusional fractionation during co2 outgassing the fractionation lead to an enrichment of c13 in the remaining dic due to the faster diffusion coefficient of c12o2 in addition the equilibrium exchange fractionation between the dic and atmospheric co2 are also considered as potential reason for the increasing δ13cdic in river waters aucour et al 1999 cartwright 2010 however if there exists violent co2 outgassing δ13cdic will be primarily controlled by diffusional fractionation because the gas evasion continuously alters the statue of the system which is hard to reach the chemical equilibrium doctor et al 2008 recent studies found that pco2 increase dramatically in the headwater or the zone with groundwater influx and then large proportions of dic contents are lost to the atmosphere within several kilometers or even hundred meters boano et al 2014 deirmendjian and abril 2018 doctor et al 2008 this process is always accompanied by a violent diffusional fractionation deirmendjian and abril 2018 the co2 degas model given by polsenaere and abril 2012 is employed to describe this fractionation this model suits river water with ph ranged from 4 6 to 7 2 where co2 inputs outputs conservatively affect the co2 pool the kinetic fractionation shift both pco2 δ13cdic and ph in river water several potential conditions are shown in fig 8 from an initial pco2 of 10 1 5μatm ta which is assumed to equal with hco3 in this study of 1 8 mmol l lowest concentrations in main channel and 2 8 mmol l mean concentrations in main channel the initial ph and δ13cdic are calculated by the open system evolution the final states are determined by the ph value at 7 2 solid arrow in fig 8 the fractionation shifts the δ13cdic 2 which approaches the estimated value 1 8 based on the predominance of carbonate weathering and high ta values polsenaere and abril 2012 apparently when ph reaches 7 2 the pco2 level in river water is still far exceed that in atmosphere indicating the presence of diffusion at a higher ph the kinetic fractionation occurs in both the kinetic diffusion of co2 between the river water air interface and the conversion between the carbonate species doctor et al 2008 observed an exponential liner relationship existing between the δ13cdic and lnepco2 with a slope of 2 3 to 2 4 with a wide ph range dotted arrow the shift of δ13cdic and lnepco2 using co2 degas model seems accord with the field observation slope when carbonate weathering predominates and ph 7 2 this result may denote that whatever ph the carbonate mineral dissolution finally reaches the co2 outgassing will lead to an approximately linger relationship between δ13cdic and lnepco2 thus a rough fractionation line can be drawn which describes the variation of δ13cdic and pco2 during co2 outgassing except some samples collected in tributaries located in silicate terrains most samples in main channel are broadly distributed along the assumed fractionation line with a slight deviation this slight deviation may result from errors derived from the estimation of δ13cdic in soil respiration and mineral dissolution the δ13cdic values increase with the pco2 decrease indicating the significant effect of fractionation on riverine δ13cdic the samples collected in tributaries located in silicate terrains own relatively lower δ13cdic and pco2 levels and are far from above fractionation line δ13cdic derived from silicate weathering under closed system is more affected by the diffusional fractionation from pco2 of 10 2 3 to 10 1 75 ta of 0 58 mmol l lowest concentrations observed in tributaries when ph reaches 7 2 the shift of δ13cdic will be 4 7 analogously the subsequent fractionation will further increase δ13cdic while decrease the pco2 dotted arrow in fig 8 some samples with the lower δ13cdic and pco2 levels are closed to the assumed fractionation line this reveals that silicate mineral dissolution is probably under closed conditions besides the diffusional fractionation the isotopic exchange between the riverine dic and atmosphere also contributes the increasing of riverine δ13cdic given by aucour et al 1999 the change of δ13cdic can be expressed as a function of time by δ 13 c dic δ 13 c a ε δ 13 c a ε δ 13 c dic 0 e k c eq h d i c t where δ13ca and δ13cdic 0 yield the δ13c of atmospheric co2 8 and initial dic respectively ε represents the fractionation between co2 and hco3 9 k is the gas transfer velocity cm h h is the mean depth of the river for a k of 8 12 cm h h of 2 3 m starting with a δ13cdic 0 of 11 dic 2 3 mmol l raymond et al 2012 respectively it would take more than 15 days to shift the δ13cdic about 1 2 though limited isotopic exchange between the riverine dic and atmosphere can also partially increase the riverine δ13cdic in large watershed after the dic flux add in to river water the diffusion driven by co2 concentration gradient between river water and atmosphere shift the δ13cdic ph and pco2 levels when the dic mainly from carbonate weathering fractionation of δ13cdic is relatively small while the high co2 level inheriting from groundwater drops quickly a negative relationship between the δ13cdic and pco2 can be observed which can interpret the characteristics of δ13cdic and pco2 patterns in the main channel of xijiang river water the observed spatial distributions of ph and pco2 fig 2 probably result from the continuously soil groundwater influx with lower ph and high pco2 values and co2 outgassing the distinct hydrogeochemical and isotopic data between the upper reaches and lower reaches indicates they act differently in controlling carbon cycling processing and transporting though there is widespread silicate terrain in the lower reaches the main source of dic in the mainstream of xijiang river is from carbonate weathering occurring in the upper reaches as evidenced by the dominance of ca2 mg2 and hco3 the high ph and dic values in the upper reaches reveal the mineral dissolution occurring under the open system δ13cdic in the upper reaches reflects the exchange fractionation during mineral dissolution while in the lower reaches the silicate weathering products with low ph and low dic concentrations discharge in to the river water thus both the ph and dic concentrations exhibited relatively lower values compared to the upper reaches the co2 outgassing continuously occurs and cause the diffusional fractionation the diffusion enriches the 13c in riverine dic and decrease the pco2 along the flow direction thus carbon cycling and transporting in xijiang river are controlled by the lithologic difference between the upper reaches and lower reaches the corresponding mineral dissolution processes and co2 outgassing 5 conclusions and implications in this study the systematic data of major ions δ13cdic in xijiang river basin involving the main channel and 42 tributaries during the dry season were presented the predominance of major ions has been determined through stoichiometry and statistical method the evolution of dic and δ13cdic from soil respiration mineral dissolution and co2 outgassing have been presented quantitatively the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the hydro chemistry in the xijiang river basin is mainly predominated by the carbonate weathering while some tributaries in the lower reaches are controlled by the silicate weathering chemical weathering is mainly completed by the soil co2 h2so4 also take part in the mineral dissolution as indicated by the relationships between ca2 mg2 hco3 and so4 2 hco3 2 the high dic concentrations and pco2 level reveal the mineral dissolution is probably completed under open or partly open condition because closed system evolution can not generate the high dic concentrations observed in xijiang river water even with possible highest soil respiration rate the signals of δ13cdic also support the dissolution is completed under open or partly open condition dic derived from chemical weathering completed by co2 and h2so4 exhibits similar δ13cdic values it reveals the equilibrium fractionation exchange between soil co2 and dic controls the δ13cdic values 3 the high pco2 level in river water compared to that in atmosphere is caused by the soil influx input the co2 concentration gradient drives a co2 diffusion from river water to atmosphere which significantly decreases the pco2 level and cause a diffusional fractionation the fractionation lead to an enrichment of c13 in the remaining dic δ13cdic exhibits a negative relationship between pco2 as previous studies observed 4 this study advances a new interpretation of riverine δ13cdic the direct implication is that δ13cdic in river water cannot be simply explained as the sources mixing and employed to quantify the relative proportions of carbonate and silicate minerals dissolution because both the mineral dissolution and co2 outgassing can easily shift the δ13cdic signals inherited from the soil co2 or carbonate this study suggests that δ13cdic is supposed to trace the geochemical processes i e co2 outgassing mineral dissolution rather than represent the signals of sources the further implication is the interaction between the global climate change and the above evolution the increasing temperatures will promote soil respiration dic evolution may provide a positive feedback to atmospheric co2 level and global climate change credit authorship contribution statement jinke liu

5253,a trapezoidal boundary location algorithm tbla for the dry wet boundaries of the land surface temperature tm fractional vegetation coverage fc trapezoidal framework is derived the new model pcalep for pixel component arranging comparing and layered energy partition uses newly developed tbla and combines field measured values of the extreme dry wet points to estimate the theoretical temperatures of the tm fc trapezoid and calculate surface energy fluxes the automatic and high precision location algorithm for dry wet boundaries greatly reduces the uncertainty caused by the extreme pixels selection the results show pcalep simulates overall accuracy of root mean square error rmse and bias for latent heat flux le of 36 3 w m2 and 21 3 w m2 in yueyang site and 39 7 w m2 and 27 7 w

by albedo related parameters with the least impact from meteorological parameters such as friction wind speed u the tbla proposed in the paper can be applied to all trapezoidal framework boundary

accurate measurements and estimates of the et rate are important in many respects including global climate evolution water resources evaluation guiding agricultural drainage and irrigation monitoring drought conditions and improving the utilization of agricultural water resources bastiaanssen et al 2002 kang et al 2003 anderson et al 2007 liu et al 2012 chen et al 2020a b et consists of soil evaporation e and vegetation transpiration t and estimation of the components of et and its partitioning have crucial significance to quantify vegetation water use efficiency and soil water consumption yang and shang 2013 song et al 2016 in particular t occupies a dominant position in total et according to massive previous research e g wen et al 2016 yao et al 2017 xu et al 2018 chen et al 2020a b wen et al 2016 partitioned the et in an oasis cropland using stable isotope method with results indicating the t et values ranged from 0 71 to 0 96 across the growing season chen et al 2020a b developed a modified shuttleworth wallace s w model and combined with machine learning model to partition the daily et for a cabbage farmland suggested the average t et ratio in each planting season can reached 0 78 for a large scale yao et al 2017 estimated using an energy balance model that the e and t results in north china show the ratio t et reached 0 78 0 95 in summer xu et al 2018 demonstrated that global t et varies between 0 62 0 06 based on earth system models esms wei et al 2017 developed an lai function model with t et yield of 57 2 6 8 in global scale traditional estimates of et are based on methods and measurements of so air temperature ta wind speed u and relative humidity rh are applicable to the local scale over regional scales more than 100 000 km2 it is difficult to obtain the required land surface features since water and energy fluxes have high heterogeneity allen et al 2007 trenberth et al 2009 yu et al 2018 however with recent developments in remote sensing technology the use of a variety of remote sensing data sources combined with land surface meteorological factors to estimate et and its components over large areas has dramatically changed sánchez et al 2008 trenberth et al 2009 yan et al 2012 satellite based et modeling can be categorized into one and two source schemes one source approaches are suitable for areas with uniform surface features friedl 1995 chehbouni et al 1997 however typical natural features entail far more complexity limiting the applicability of the one source approach two source models divide the soil vegetation atmosphere system into two sources vegetation atmosphere and soil atmosphere and this approach more accurately characterizes the water vapor diffusion process from soil and vegetation previous studies have shown that two source models have better performance over one source models in simulation of regional et e g choi et al 2009 tang et al 2015 norman et al 1995 accounting for the characteristics of non uniform coverage of row crops proposed a two source energy balance model tseb a model specifically designed for remote sensing applications the tseb model simplifies the traditional two source model and facilitates a solution based on a combination of remote sensing data and terrestrial data and have been widely used e g yang et al 2015a b yao et al 2017 song et al 2016 2018 however tseb require detailed information on resistance parameters e g aerodynamic resistance soil surface resistance vegetation canopy resistance etc these resistance parameter calculations require extensive ground measured data and complex calculation process and introduce large uncertainties to the model results the situation has changed when the trapezoidal feature space approach appeared and solves complex impedance calculation for each pixel carlson et al 1994 carlson and ripley 1997 jiang et al 2009 moran et al 1994 proposed using the trapezoidal framework to derive the crop water stress index cwsi and developed an approach suitable for identification of the normalized vegetation index land surface temperature ndvi tm trapezoidal feature space since then there has been significant development of the trapezoidal framework model for remotely sensed estimates of et for example zhang et al 2005 used the pixel component arranging and comparing algorithm pcaca method to separate the tm at the satellite pixel scale 1 km based on trapezoidal feature space theory long and singh 2012b developed a two source trapezoidal model ttme for et by interpreting the remotely sensed tm fc space and the concept of soil surface moisture availability isopleths superimposed on the space yang and shang 2013 developed a hybrid two source scheme and trapezoidal framework based et model htem and verified the model in two ec sites yang et al 2015a b conducted an enhanced two source evapotranspiration model for land eteml based on the difference of component temperatures and ta the key to using tm fc trapezoidal framework model to separate the land surface temperature is to identify the dry wet boundaries of the tm fc trapezoidal at present many approaches have been based on an energy balance theory to locate the tm fc trapezoidal theoretical boundary including pcaca by zhang et al 2005 ttme by long and singh 2012b and htem by yang and shang 2013 however reliable theoretical boundary positioning of tm fc trapezoidal relies on accurate actual boundary positioning and extreme pixel selection inaccurate positioning of the actual boundary may cause large uncertainty in selection of extreme pixels and theoretical temperature calculations and subsequent flux estimates especially if the study area does not have widely ranging land surface types there will be scattered spots or even vacant areas in areas of the dry wet envelope and brings great difficulties to the boundaries positioning of the tm fc trapezoidal hence accurate positioning the actual boundary of the trapezium is critical to the entire calculation process of various kinds of trapezoidal framework based two source models regarding the positioning algorithm of the actual boundary of tm fc trapezoidal efforts have been made to locate the boundaries by dividing vertical strips for the trapezoid to get maximum minimum temperatures and using a linear regression method to locate the dry wet boundaries e g zhang et al 2005 tang et al 2010 long and singh 2012b however accurate positioning is still a challenge due to the different distribution of scatter points on the dry wet boundaries usually the distribution of scatter points near the dry boundary are denser and the boundary is smoother and relatively easy to locate however for the wet boundary due to the presence of wetlands water bodies or beaches the scatter distribution is more discrete and sparse this causes the positioning to be relatively difficult zhang et al 2005 tang et al 2010 long and singh 2012b in response to this phenomenon we propose different customized automatic algorithms for the dry wet boundaries of the tm fc trapezoid the purpose of this paper is to develop an automatic trapezoidal boundary location algorithm tbla and to couple the tbla into the pcaca model zhang et al 2005 the new trapezoidal framework model pixel component arranging comparing and layered energy partition model

al 2004 2 3 pcalep model assumptions and structure the pcalep model assumes that in the area consisting of soil and vegetation the soil and vegetation layers have the same water status but different energy conditions carlson et al 1994 1995 zhang et al 2005 therefore the surface temperature and energy of the soil and vegetation layers can be decomposed based on this assumption the basic idea of the pcalep is to separate the land surface temperature and albedo then separate the total net radiant flux rn into vegetation net radiant flux rnv and soil net radiant flux rns for rnv and rns using the bowen ratio method to partition rns to soil latent heat flux les soil sensible heat flux hs soil heat flux g and partition rnv to vegetation latent heat flux lev vegetation sensible heat flux hv the model structure of pcalep is shown in fig 2 2 4 separation of land surface temperature with pcalep it is assumed that tm was a nonlinear combination of vegetation and soil temperatures norman et al 1995 anderson et al 2007 long and singh 2012b the relationship between tm and fc has the following expression 1 σ ε m t m 4 σ ε v f c t v 4 σ ε s 1 f c t s 4 in eq 1 εm εv and εs are the emissivities of the land surface vegetation canopy and soil surface respectively unitless which can be estimated by mira et al 2007 and rubio et al 2003 tm fc are the land surface temperature k and fractional vegetation coverage unitless tm can be obtained from mod11 images using a mono window algorithm for correction qin et al 2001 and fc can be calculated from the mod13 ndvi image supply information part 2 tv and ts are soil surface temperature k and vegetation canopy temperature k which can t be directly solved to determine the tv and ts we derive eq 1 for fc and combine the derived equation with eq 1 to get the expressions of tv and ts 2 t s 1 ε s ε m t m 4 t m 4 d ε m d f c 4 ε m t m 3 d t m d f c 1 4 3 t v 1 ε v ε m t m 4 1 f t m 4 d ε m d f c 4 ε m t m 3 d t m d f c 1 4 in eqs 2 and 3 it is assumed that t m 4 d ε m d f c 0 so there is only one unknown parameter d t m d f c remaining the method to determine this parameter is the key to tm decomposition d t m d f c represents the scatter slope inside the tm fc trapezoid resulting in the problem translating into locating the dry wet boundaries of the tm fc trapezoid and then linear interpolation of the slope of scatter inside the trapezoid 2 5 tm fc trapezoidal theoretical and actual boundary positioning moran et al 1994 1997 demonstrated that the scatter plot of vegetation index and the surface temperature is a trapezoid shape and the trapezoid framework could be reflected as the soil moisture condition in an area the dry wet boundaries and each scatter slope is shown in fig 3 within the trapezoid framework point a indicates dry bare land temperature tsd and point b indicates vegetation water deficit called the dry vegetation surface temperature tvd while point c represents the wet and bare soil surface temperature tsw and point d represents the vegetation with sufficient water supply referred to as driest fully vegetated surface temperature tvw the ab line determines the upper boundary of the trapezoid called the dry edge and the cd line defines the lower boundary of the trapezoid called the wet edge previous studies have shown that there exist gradual transitions of soil moisture lines in the tm fc trapezoid e g carlson et al 1994 1995 for the dry boundary location method in the tbla the specific calculation flow charts are shown in figs 4 and 5 as described above the distribution of scattered points near the dry wet boundaries are routinely different so different algorithms for dry wet edges were proposed in tbla for the determination of the wet boundary the horizontal band is further divided on the basis of the vertical interval as shown in fig 6 first the distribution density of scattered points in the horizontal strips is calculated from the top to the bottom the density differences of the adjacent strips are calculated and the lowest temperature selected where the density difference is greatest followed by iteration and regression according to the algorithm of the top border to get the lower boundary the specific calculation procedure is illustrated in fig 7 in theory once the actual boundaries of the trapezoid are located the slope of each internal scatter can be obtained by linear interpolation however in the actual situation if the study area doesn t have a full range of land surface types and conditions especially in the absence of absolute dry wet spots there will be scattered vacant areas inside the dry wet boundary therefore a part of the combination of tm and fc is missing furthermore there will be large uncertainties in the determination of the dry wet line and d t m df therefore based on the actual boundary of the tm fc trapezoid the two pixels from the leftmost end low fc and the rightmost end high fc of the dry edge as two extreme dry pixels are selected specifically two pixels from the leftmost low fc and the rightmost high fc sides of the wet edge as extreme wet pixels the four theoretical temperatures can be located by the energy balance theory combined with the meteorological station near the four extreme pixels supply information part 1 zhang et al 2005 long and singh 2012b 2 6 separation of land surface albedo with pcalep to obtain the rn and estimate the rnv and rns the land surface albedo αm unitless must be separated into vegetation albedo αv unitless and soil albedo αs unitless the scatter plot of the albedo fractional vegetation coverage αm fc is also a trapezoidal shape therefore the tbla can be applied to locate the αm fc trapezoidal boundary the modis mod43 band 5 albedo product was used in determination of αm this product provides black light albedo and white light albedo over the regions 0 3 0 7 μm 0 7 5 0 μm 0 3 5 0 μm the expression for the αm fc equation is established in eq 4 zhang et al 2005 sánchez et al 2008 long and singh 2012b 4 α m 1 f c α s f c α v similar to the eq 1 eq 4 is used to derive the fc and combine the derived equation with the eq 4 to obtain the expressions for αs and αv 5 α s α m f c d α m d f c 6 α v α m 1 f c d α m d f c 2 7 calculation and separation of rn the rn involves visible near infrared and thermal infrared bands can be

taylor 1972 from the results of the tv and ts the soil surface temperature fractional vegetation coverage ts fc and vegetation canopy temperature fractional vegetation coverage tv fc can be constructed as a trapezoid shape and the tbla can be used to determine these two types of trapezoid boundary to obtain the dry wet temperature values the bowen ratios can be calculated by the

trapezoidal in three test days of 2015 25apri 11aug and 20dec day of year doys 115 223 and 354 and fig 10 shows the spatial distribution of fc tv and ts from fig 10 the fc in the south region has been consistently higher in different seasons the average fc has reached over 0 7 in the whole year while the fc in north region is lower in winter 0 22 0 35 and higher in the summer 0 71 0 89 from the spatial distribution of ts and tv in three test days the ts were higher than the tv in doy115 and doy223 while the tv was higher than the ts in doy354 fig 10 corresponding the slope of tm fc trapezoid were negative in doy115 and doy223 and the slope was positive in doy354 this indicates that the slope of tm fc trapezoidal is closely related to ts and tv allocation when a specific pixel fc is determined the value of the tm that constitutes this pixel can be composed of an infinite number of combinations of tv and ts karnieli et al 2010 indicated that when water is the limiting factor for vegetation growth the tm fc correlation is negative and a positive correlation exists when energy is the limiting factor for vegetation growth in addition from fig 9 in the part of the tm fc trapezoid where the fc is lower usually this occurs in bare land and the tm are higher than 310 k for doy115 300 k for doy223 295 k for doy354 in these areas scatter vacancies often exist in the same fc area where the tm is lower than 310 k for doy115 300 k for doy223 295 k for doy354 the scatter distributions are sparse this region may be wetlands waterbodies and sandy beaches for the αm separation the tbla are used to locate the upper and lower boundaries of the αm fc trapezoid fig 11 from the spatial distribution of fc and αm in areas with low fc eastern north regions as shown in fig 10 these areas are mainly bare soil with high αm and the average αm can be close to 0 2 0 3 in areas with high fc the αm is lower and average αm is only about 0 01 0 05 for the same fc large αm could indicate relatively high tm and low soil moisture fig 11 is the scatterplot distribution of αm fc in doy115 doy223 and doy354 the envelope of the upper left pixel is not a straight line but instead a curve with a peak which becomes larger with the fc increase and then becomes smaller this is an important phenomenon which expresses the gradual transition process of the αs and αv weighted average the left side of the peak is the αs control zone and the right side zone of the peak is controlled by αv since the slope of the αm fc trapezoid is negative e g see fig 11 the αs are all higher than the αv in the doy115 doy223 and doy354 e g see fig 12 in addition it should be noted that the trapezoidal shape of the αm fc is more typical and regular than the tm fc trapezoidal figs 8 and 10 compared with tm fc trapezoidal the upper and lower boundaries of αm fc trapezoidal are not susceptible to vacancies and boundaries are also smooth for αm fc previous study indicated there still exists gradual transition soil moisture lines between the upper and lower boundaries with same soil moisture condition and same slope e g carlson et al 1994 1995 zhang et al 2005 long and singh 2012b 3 2 model validation with ec tower measurements a total of 76 cloudless days in 2015 were selected to calculate and obtain the instantaneous le of satellite transit time every day the flux station uses the average flux in the upwind source area li et al 2008 gonzalez dugo et al 2009 the instantaneous le values were converted to daily values through constant evaporative fraction method nishida et al 2003 sugita and brutsaert 1991 scatter plot of the model simulated four components in energy budgets with ec system measured values are shown in fig 13 the statistical indicators are shown in tables 1 and 2 for doy115 doy 223 and doy 354 the rmse and bias of the simulated available energy rn determined to be 18 4 w m2 and 12 8 w m2 17 5 w m2 and 11 8 w m2 14 6 w m2 and 9 3 w m2 respectively in yueyang site and 18 8 w m2 and 13 0 w m2 1 6 w m2 and 1 1 w m2 7 1 w m2 and 4 7 w m2 respectively for xsbn site the estimation of rn error may arise from several sources 1 based on the meteorological observation site in the spatial interpolation of so caused by the error 2 calculation of the atmospheric downward radiation causes errors for le rmse and bias are 32 7 w m2 and 17 3 w m2 40 5 w m2 and 26 6 w m2 35 6 w m2 and 20 1 w m2 respectively in yueyang site and 38 5 w m2 and 27 5 w m2 37 0 w m2 and 26 3 w m2 43 6 w m2 and 29 4 w m2 respectively for xsbn site the average rmse and bias are 36 3 w m2 and 21 3 w m2 for yueyang site and 39 7 w m2 and 27 7 w m2 for xsbn site in three test days for h the average rmse and bias are 27 4 w m2 and 16 3 w m2 in yueyang site and 52 3 w m2 and 37 8 w m2 for xsbn site for g rmse and bias were 8 2 w m2 and 4 5 w m2 in yueyang site and 15 1 w m2 and 10 6 w m2 for xsbn site in three test days the model provides relatively good accuracy of g due to better estimation of rn eq 10 in general pcalep provides relatively good estimates of rn and g but the model shows underestimation of le and overestimation of h in most cases tables 1 and 2 3 3 et partition performance compare with two methods due to the lack of ground observation data for e and t we compared the e and t results from the pcalep model with two types of et partition models the first type of model was proposed by zhou et al 2016 they used the ratio of apparent underlying water use efficiency uwuea to the potential underlying water use efficiency uwuep to characterization the t et in the ecosystem the second type of model was proposed by wei et al 2017 they conducted a relationship between the t et and lai in various vegetation surface types and considered t is a function of lai and fc for each land cover the model has been verified at the global scale the detailed information and calculation methods for these two types of models can be found in zhou et al 2016 and wei et al 2017 we tested the et partition results of the pcalep uwue and lai function model for 76 cloudless days it should be noted that the lai function model was originally designed for et partitioning for monthly or annual time scales wei et al 2017 here we used the same input data with pcalep and applied the model at a daily scale to ensure the three models had the same driving force and comparability fig 14 presents the scatter plot of t et value estimated by pcalep with the two models with each scatter plot representing the average value of t et over the whole region for one test day results for the r2 and rmse were 0 61 and 0 147 compared with uwue model and 0 52 and 0 189 compared with lai function model in the 76 test days the pcalep results are closer to the uwue model and larger difference to lai function model in t et estimation this may be due to the method based on lai function requires relatively few parameter inputs the model designed suitable for application in large scale and simple model physical mechanism will bring larger errors in regional scale compared with other two source models in general despite the large uncertainty exist this comparison results proves the reliable et partition performance of the pcalep model 3 4 spatial distribution patterns of e t and t et the spatial distribution of e t and t et in doy115 doy223 and doy354 are shown in fig 15 from fig 15 the energy fluxes in the study region have significant temporal and spatial differences in 2015 among them doy115 was in winter fc in the northern region was lower and higher in the southern region correspondingly the e in the northern region was higher and lower in the southern region this is due to the fact that in the northern region a large area was bare soil and rn was mostly allocated to the soil layer while in the southern region the fc was higher and the rn was mostly allocated to the vegetation layer t and e have completely different spatial patterns t in the southern region was higher and lower in the northern region for a summer day doy223 the proportions of tsouth and tnorth generally show the similar distribution the fc in the northern region began to increase in doy223 and tnorth also increased with fc in contrast enorth decreased further close to the lowest level in the whole year and the t et reached the highest value in the whole year the average value of t et in the study region was 0 69 in doy354 the spatial pattern was similar with doy115 fc in the northern region began to decrease enorth started to increase and tnorth started to decline for the southern region due to the high fc throughout the year the e and t spatial distributions show less change 3 5 model sensitivity analysis to assess the degree of influence of different input parameters on the model results a sensitivity analysis was performed to observe the change degree of le and lev le sensitivity parameters were calculated as after sánchez et al 2008 zhan et al 1996 18 s i 1 l e l e 0 l e 0 100 19 s i 2 l e v l e l e v l e 0 l e v l e 0 100 among them le and lev le are the model output le w m2 and output lev le after variable increases or decreases respectively le0 and lev le0 are the original le w m2 and original lev le based on the various input parameters of the pcalep attention was focused on 1 temperature tm ta tsd tvd tsw tvw 2 albedo αm αs and αv 3 vegetation parameters fc and lai 4 meteorological parameters so ea and u for temperature related parameters a temperature range of 2 k 2 k per gradient of 0 5 k for vegetation and albedo parameters set 20 20 every 5 gradient interval long and singh 2012b yang and shang 2013 considering the data quality of various products of modis and the range of fc and soil moisture changes doy 115 in 2015 was selected to conduct the entire sensitivity analysis 3 5 1 sensitivity to temperature parameters as seen in tables 3 and 4 figs 16 and 17 tm increased by 1 k le decreased by 9 8 and lev le decreased by 2 7 while ta increased by 1 k le increased by 11 4 and lev le decreased by 4 7 this is due to the change in tm which moves the dry wet boundaries of the tm fc trapezoid and this change has a negative effect on le and lev le the positive effect of ta on le and negative effect on lev le due to the increase of ta will increase the atmospheric long wave radiation and increase the rn eq 7 long and singh 2012a report a 1 k increase in tm and ta could result in a 14 3 decrease and a 13 8 increase in the le estimates using the ttme model yang and shang 2013 report an increase of 1 k in tm and ta resulted in an 11 decrease and an 8 5 increase of the le estimates in addition the effect of four extreme pixel temperatures was investigated an increase of 1 k in tsd and tvd resulted in a 5 5 and 4 8 increase in estimated le for lev le increase of 1 k in tsd caused 8 2 increase in lev le but increase of 1 k in tvd caused 7 4 decrease in lev le with an increase of 1 k in tsw and tvw the le value decreases by 4 9 and 6 8 respectively for lev le when there is an increase of 1 k in tsw the lev le value decreases 6 9 but an increase of 1 k in tvw corresponding with 7 1 increase for lev le the effect of four theoretical temperatures on le and lev le due to change the four theoretical temperatures will move the dry wet boundaries of the tm fc trapezoid thus changing the slope of the upper lower boundaries and the slope of each internal point to affect the allocation of ts and tv thereby affecting the le and lev le values 3 5 2 sensitivity to albedo parameters as shown in tables 3 and 4 figs 16 and 17 an increase of 10 in αm αs and αv resulted in 2 9 0 9 and 2 5 decreases in estimated le the effect of albedo on le can be explained as follows when the albedo increases the proportion of energy reaching the land surface soil surface and vegetation surface and reflecting back to the atmosphere will increase resulting in declines of rn rns and rnv and causing a decrease in le for lev le αm shows less sensitivity with lev le 10 increase αm 1 6 decrease lev le but αs and αv shows strong influence on lev le 10 increase αs 8 3 increase lev le 10 increase αv 8 7 decrease lev le the αs and αv mainly affects lev le by affecting the rn allocation proportion of the soil and vegetation layers eqs 8 and 9 3 5 3 sensitivity to vegetation the impact of vegetation parameters have consistent effects on le and lev le when lai and fc increased by 10 le increased by 8 and 8 9 respectively lev le increased by 8 8 and 9 9 respectively tables 3 and 4 figs 16 and 17 3 5 4 sensitivity to meteorological parameters three meteorological parameters were selected for sensitivity analysis so u and ea the so showed a strong and positive impact on le where an increase of 5 10 15 20 in so resulted in 4 7 9 4 14 0 and 18 4 increases in le due to so does not participate in the calculation of energy allocation so does not affect the estimation of lev le the ea showed weak and positive impact on le and lev le an increase of 5 10 15 20 in ea resulted in 0 7 1 6 2 4 and 3 increases in le and 0 1 0 5 0 9 and 1 3 increases in lev le for u an increase of 5 10 15 20 in u resulted in a 2 1 4 6 3 8 6 decrease in le and 1 0 1 9 2 7 3 5 increases in lev le in general for le estimates pcalep is sensitive to so fc ta tm and not very sensitive to ea and u model exhibits general sensitivity to albedo parameters for et partition pcalep is very sensitive to fc lai tsd tvd tsw tvw αs and αv not sensitive to αm tm and meteorological parameters 4 further discussion 4 1 pcalep model performance comparison with different two source models to evaluate the model performance we compared the le estimation results from pcalep with the original pcaca model zhang et al 2005 and several dual source models ttme long and singh 2012b tseb 1 choi et al 2009 tseb 2 yao et al 2017 htem yang and shang 2013 and tim choi et al 2009 the comparison results of rmse and bias values are shown in fig 18 for rn and g estimates pcalep provided the best performance compared with the six other two source models for le and h pcalep provided the slightly better simulation results pcalep model shows relatively superior model performance mainly for the following reasons 1 using the tbla to assist in positioning of tm fc trapezoidal theoretical boundaries greatly improving the reliability of boundary positioning 2 pcalep assumes tm is a non linear combination of tv and ts and decomposes the two temperatures eq 1 compared with the linear combination assumptions used in some two source models e g norman et al 1995 nishida et al 2003 yang and shang 2013 yao et al 2017 the non linear assumptions could better reflect the actual temperature mixing situation of the soil and vegetation layer 3 since iteration processes are not required in pcalep pcalep avoids the large uncertainty caused by the iterative process which was widely used in tseb model many previous studies have shown that the priestley taylor coefficient estimated based on the iterative process in the tseb model will cause the model to overestimate t and underestimate e e g norman et al 1995 yang et al 2015a b gan and gao 2015 the pcalep without using an iterative process will undoubtedly improve model performance however it should be noted that the results shows an underestimation of le and an overestimation of h in most cases for yueyang farmland station le was underestimated 17 3 w m2 26 6 w m2 20 1 w m2 respectively in doy 115 223 and 354 while for xsbn forest station le was underestimated 27 5 w m2 26 3 w m2 and 29 4 w m2 this may be due to the uncertainty in the weighted sum assumption of the component temperatures and albedos eqs 1 6 therefore for the further improvement of the pcalep the uncertainty and reliability of the assumption needs to be carefully evaluated in addition from the verification results of et partition the pcalep model also showed reliable and robustness in estimation of the e and t the t et varies from 0 52 to 0 75 in the 76 days of vegetables and rice fields er raki et al 2010 investigated t et in an olive field with results showing t et ranges from 0 51 0 79 poblete echeverría and ortega farias 2012 estimated t et of 0 69 in a vineyard field pcalep shows comparable results in farmland compared with previous studies for a forested field the t et varies from 0 63 to 0 86 in the 76 days calculation compared with raz yaseef et al 2012 and wilson et al 2001 the pcalep model shows some overestimation about 25 40 nevertheless it is to be noted that errors caused by ec observations and spatial scale matching between ec and modis imagery pixel are not negligible foken 2008 reported ec observations will bring 5 20 as typical error levels in addition the modis imagery resolution used in this study was 1 1km although three ec devices were used at both the yueyang station and xsbn station to cover the large areas surface flux but the ec footprints still didn t match the modis pixels very well more important ec observations have serious energy closure problems where the ec closure of this study was 0 82 at yueyang site and 0 79 at xsbn site this energy closure problems is due to the ec method not being able to capture large eddies and can only capture small eddies near the ground surface wilson 2002 foken 2008 although twine et al 2000 proposed two methods to solve the energy closure problem by calculating the residual of the energy balance re and retaining the measured bowen ratio br this can t fundamentally solve the ec energy closure problem lastly inaccurate observations from ground based meteorological stations e g so ea ta and errors from modis imagery e g tm fc αm also cause large uncertainties in the modeling results therefore subsequent studies can further reduce the uncertainty of pcalep based on the matching of rs imagery and ec data on spatial scales improve the accuracy of ec and meteorological factors observations 4 2 pcalep model application conditions the pcalep model assumes the soil under a single type of vegetation and the adjacent soils constitute the smallest unit of the pcalep model the model radiation source heat source may not be the same indicating the ts and tv can be different so the tm can be separated due to the expansion of the vegetation root system and the lateral seepage of the soil moisture the soil layer water conditions and the vegetation root layer water conditions should belong to the same source moran et al 1994 1997 the uncertainty of this hypothesis comes from the physical mechanism of the pcalep for example if the study region includes villages and farmlands or have large areas of bare land and water bodies with similar area proportions where the patch distribution of soil and vegetation definitely have very different soil moisture conditions in this case the patch model has an advantage over pcalep which is based on two source energy mixing hypothesis as a result when applying the pcalep model the study region requires a full range of land surface types and vegetation coverage 4 3 advantages of the pcalep 1 the pcalep requires only four extreme pixel impedance calculations which greatly reduces the large uncertainty caused by complex impedance calculations for all pixels in pcalep the tm were separated and then combined with the measured values of the meteorological factors in dry wet point to calculate the four theoretical temperatures the meteorological data for these four points can be obtained through the observation of the nearby meteorological station 2 the tbla overcomes the uncertainty of the dry wet boundaries location greatly reducing the uncertainty of the extreme pixel selection the tbla shows good positioning accuracy to locate wet edges where the discrete and uneven scatter distribution cause difficult to locate and fully exploits the advantages of iterative calculations and regression analyses it not only excludes the effect of anomalous scatter on the boundary location but also maximizes the scatter numbers inside the trapezoid furthermore tbla can be applied to various trapezoidal feature spaces such as αm fc ts fc tv fc etc and various trapezoidal framework based two source models such as ttme htem eteml etc 3 pcalep model requires both relatively fewer and more easily accessible inputs the model requires two type sources of parameter inputs one from remote sensing images tm fc αm lai and these parameters are easily accessible from websites the other types of parameters are meteorological factors vpd so ea u and ta could be derived from ground based meteorological station and spatial interpolation or obtained from meteorological data sets 4 4 limitations of pcalep 1 the difficulty in quantitative remote sensing based regional surface flux lies in the acquisition of non remote sensing parameters which are particularly challenging since some of these parameters are very important for example sensitivity analyses show that the so plays a decisive role in calculating of le but so is obtained from spatial interpolation for multiple ground meteorological stations if there are insufficient numbers of meteorological stations in the study area or the observation data are not sufficiently precise this will result in a large error to the model calculation results 2 due to the limitation of monitoring methods this study has not evaluated the et partition performance with measured values such as an isotope technique later research may further validate the e and t results of the pcalep model on different surface conditions and climates 5 conclusions 1 this paper proposes a trapezoidal framework based two source model pcalep the pcalep model estimates the surface energy balance components based on the newly developed tbla method tbla provides accurate and robust positioning for dry wet boundaries of tm fc trapezoidal which greatly reduces the model uncertainty caused by the extreme pixels selection 2 the pcalep model simulates overall accuracy for rmse and bias for each variable as rn of 16 8 w m2 and 11 3 w m2 for g of 8 2 w m2 and 4 5 w m2 for le of 36 3 w m2 and 21 3 w m2 for h of 27 4 w m2 and 16 3 w m2 respectively in yueyang site and rn of 4 1 w m2 and 2 5 w m2 for g of 15 1 w m2 and 10 6 w m2 for le of 39 7 w m2 and 27 7 w m2 for h of 52 3 w m2 and 37 8 w m2 respectively in xsbn site in three test days the model provides higher accuracy compared with several other two source models 3 the model simulation of t et in the study area in 2015 was 0 69 demonstrating the dominant importance of t in total et t et results comparison with uwue model zhou et al 2016 and lai function model wei et al 2017 show that pcalep can provide reliable et partition estimates 4 the spatial distribution results show that enorth was higher in winter and lower in summer tnorth was lower in winter and higher in summer due to the high fc throughout the year in the southern region the tsouth shows higher level and a lower level of esouth in annual year 5 sensitivity analyses suggest that the greatest impacts on simulation le results are fc tm and so followed by albedo related parameters and the least affected are some meteorological parameters such as ea and u for et partition pcalep is very sensitive to fc

5253,a trapezoidal boundary location algorithm tbla for the dry wet boundaries of the land surface temperature tm fractional vegetation coverage fc trapezoidal framework is derived the new model pcalep for pixel component arranging comparing and layered energy partition uses newly developed tbla and combines field measured values of the extreme dry wet points to estimate the theoretical

accurate measurements and estimates of the et rate are important in many respects including global climate evolution water resources evaluation guiding agricultural drainage and irrigation monitoring drought conditions and improving the utilization of agricultural water resources bastiaanssen et al 2002 kang et al 2003 anderson et al 2007 liu et al 2012 chen et al 2020a b et consists of soil evaporation e and vegetation transpiration t and estimation of the components of et and its partitioning have crucial significance to quantify vegetation water use efficiency and soil water consumption yang and shang 2013 song et al 2016 in particular t occupies a dominant position in total et according to massive previous research e g wen et al 2016 yao et al 2017 xu et al 2018 chen et al 2020a b wen et al 2016 partitioned the et in an oasis cropland using stable isotope method with results indicating the t et values ranged from 0 71 to 0 96 across the growing season chen et al 2020a b developed a modified shuttleworth wallace s w model and combined with machine learning model to partition the daily et for a cabbage farmland suggested the average t et ratio in each planting season can reached 0 78 for a large scale yao et al 2017 estimated using an energy balance model that the e and t results in north china show the ratio t et reached 0 78 0 95 in summer xu et al 2018 demonstrated that global t et varies between 0 62 0 06 based on earth system models esms wei et al 2017 developed an lai function model with t et yield of 57 2 6 8 in global scale traditional estimates of et are based on methods and measurements of so air temperature ta wind speed u and relative humidity rh are applicable to the local scale over regional scales more than 100 000 km2 it is difficult to obtain the required land surface features since water and energy fluxes have high heterogeneity allen et al 2007 trenberth et al 2009 yu et al 2018 however with recent developments in remote sensing technology the use of a variety of remote sensing data sources combined with land surface meteorological factors to estimate et and its components over large areas has dramatically changed sánchez et al 2008 trenberth et al 2009 yan et al 2012 satellite based et modeling can be categorized into one and two source schemes one source approaches are suitable for areas with uniform surface features friedl 1995 chehbouni et al 1997 however typical natural features entail far more complexity limiting the applicability of the one source approach two source models divide the soil vegetation atmosphere system into two sources vegetation atmosphere and soil atmosphere and this approach more accurately characterizes the water vapor diffusion process from soil and vegetation previous studies have shown that two source models have better performance over one source models in simulation of regional et e g choi et al 2009 tang et al 2015 norman et al 1995 accounting for the characteristics of non uniform coverage of row crops proposed a two source energy balance model tseb a model specifically designed for remote sensing applications the tseb model simplifies the traditional two source model and facilitates a solution based on a combination of remote sensing data and terrestrial data and have been widely used e g yang et al 2015a b yao et al 2017 song et al 2016 2018 however tseb require detailed information on resistance parameters e g aerodynamic resistance soil surface resistance vegetation canopy resistance etc these resistance parameter calculations require extensive ground measured data and complex calculation process and introduce large uncertainties to the model results the situation has changed when the trapezoidal feature space approach appeared and solves complex impedance calculation for each pixel carlson et al 1994 carlson and ripley 1997 jiang et al 2009 moran et al 1994 proposed using the trapezoidal framework to derive the crop water stress index cwsi and developed an approach suitable for identification of the normalized vegetation index land surface temperature ndvi tm trapezoidal feature space since then there has been significant development of the trapezoidal framework model for remotely sensed estimates of et for example zhang et al 2005 used the pixel component arranging and comparing algorithm pcaca method to separate the tm at the satellite pixel scale 1 km based on trapezoidal feature space theory long and singh 2012b developed a two source trapezoidal model ttme for et by interpreting the remotely sensed tm fc space and the concept of soil surface moisture availability isopleths superimposed on the space yang and shang 2013 developed a hybrid two source scheme and trapezoidal framework based et model htem and verified the model in two ec sites yang et al 2015a b conducted an enhanced two source evapotranspiration model for land eteml based on the difference of component temperatures and ta the key to using tm fc trapezoidal framework model to separate the land surface temperature is to identify the dry wet boundaries of the tm fc trapezoidal at present many approaches have been based on an energy balance theory to locate the tm fc trapezoidal theoretical boundary including pcaca by zhang et al 2005 ttme by long and singh 2012b and htem by yang and shang 2013 however reliable theoretical boundary positioning of tm fc trapezoidal relies on accurate actual boundary positioning and extreme pixel selection inaccurate positioning of the actual boundary may cause large uncertainty in selection of extreme pixels and theoretical temperature calculations and subsequent flux estimates especially if the study area does not have widely ranging land surface types there will be scattered spots or even vacant areas in areas of the dry wet envelope and brings great difficulties to the boundaries positioning of the tm fc trapezoidal hence accurate positioning the actual boundary of the trapezium is critical to the entire calculation process of various kinds of trapezoidal framework based two source models regarding the positioning algorithm of the actual boundary of tm fc trapezoidal efforts have been made to locate the boundaries by dividing vertical strips for the trapezoid to get maximum minimum temperatures and using a linear regression method to locate the dry wet boundaries e g zhang et al 2005 tang et al 2010 long and singh 2012b however accurate positioning is still a challenge due to the different distribution of scatter points on the dry wet boundaries usually the distribution of scatter points near the dry boundary are denser and the boundary is smoother and relatively easy to locate however for the wet boundary due to the presence of wetlands water bodies or beaches the scatter distribution is more discrete and sparse this causes the positioning to be relatively difficult zhang et al 2005 tang et al 2010 long and singh 2012b in response to this phenomenon we propose different customized automatic algorithms for the dry wet boundaries of the tm fc trapezoid the purpose of this paper is to develop an automatic trapezoidal boundary location algorithm tbla and to couple the tbla into the pcaca model zhang et al 2005 the new trapezoidal framework model pixel component arranging comparing and layered energy partition model

al 2004 2 3 pcalep model assumptions and structure the pcalep model assumes that in the area consisting of soil and vegetation the soil and vegetation layers have the same water status but different energy conditions carlson et al 1994 1995 zhang et al 2005 therefore the surface temperature and energy of the soil and vegetation layers can be decomposed based on this assumption the basic idea of the pcalep is to separate the land surface temperature and albedo then separate the total net radiant flux rn into vegetation net radiant flux rnv and soil net radiant flux rns for rnv and rns using the bowen ratio method to partition rns to soil latent heat flux les soil sensible heat flux hs soil heat flux g and partition rnv to vegetation latent heat flux lev vegetation sensible heat flux hv the model structure of pcalep is shown in fig 2 2 4 separation of land surface temperature with pcalep it is assumed that tm was a nonlinear combination of vegetation and soil temperatures norman et al 1995 anderson et al 2007 long and singh 2012b the relationship between tm and fc has the following expression 1 σ ε m t m 4 σ ε v f c t v 4 σ ε s 1 f c t s 4 in eq 1 εm εv and εs are the emissivities of the land surface vegetation canopy and soil surface respectively unitless which can be estimated by mira et al 2007 and rubio et al 2003 tm fc are the land surface temperature k and fractional vegetation coverage unitless tm can be obtained from mod11 images using a mono window algorithm for correction qin et al 2001 and fc can be calculated from the mod13 ndvi image supply information part 2 tv and ts are soil surface temperature k and vegetation canopy temperature k which can t be directly solved to determine the tv and ts we derive eq 1 for fc and combine the derived equation with eq 1 to get the expressions of tv and ts 2 t s 1 ε s ε m t m 4 t m 4 d ε m d f c 4 ε m t m 3 d t m d f c 1 4 3 t v 1 ε v ε m t m 4 1 f t m 4 d ε m d f c 4 ε m t m 3 d t m d f c 1 4 in eqs 2 and 3 it is assumed that t m 4 d ε m d f c 0 so there is only one unknown parameter d t m d f c remaining the method to determine this parameter is the key to tm decomposition d t m d f c represents the scatter slope inside the tm fc trapezoid resulting in the problem translating into locating the dry wet boundaries of the tm fc trapezoid and then linear interpolation of the slope of scatter inside the trapezoid 2 5 tm fc trapezoidal theoretical and actual boundary positioning moran et al 1994 1997 demonstrated that the scatter plot of vegetation index and the surface temperature is a trapezoid shape and the trapezoid framework could be reflected as the soil moisture condition in an area the dry wet boundaries and each scatter slope is shown in fig 3 within the trapezoid framework point a indicates dry bare land temperature tsd and point b indicates vegetation water deficit called the dry vegetation surface temperature tvd while point c represents the wet and bare soil surface temperature tsw and point d represents the vegetation with sufficient water supply referred to as driest fully vegetated surface temperature tvw the ab line determines the upper boundary of the trapezoid called the dry edge and the cd line defines the lower boundary of the trapezoid called the wet edge previous studies have shown that there exist gradual transitions of soil moisture lines in the tm fc trapezoid e g carlson et al 1994 1995 for the dry boundary location method in the tbla the specific calculation flow charts are shown in figs 4 and 5 as described above the distribution of scattered points near the dry wet boundaries are routinely different so different algorithms for dry wet edges were proposed in tbla for the determination of the wet boundary the horizontal band is further divided on the basis of the vertical interval as shown in fig 6 first the distribution density of scattered points in the horizontal strips is calculated from the top to the bottom the density differences of the adjacent strips are calculated and the lowest temperature selected where the density difference is greatest followed by iteration and regression according to the algorithm of the top border to get the lower boundary the specific calculation procedure is illustrated in fig 7 in theory once the actual boundaries of the trapezoid are located the slope of each internal scatter can be obtained by linear interpolation however in the actual situation if the study area doesn t have a full range of land surface types and conditions especially in the absence of absolute dry wet spots there will be scattered vacant areas inside the dry wet boundary therefore a part of the combination of tm and fc is missing furthermore there will be large uncertainties in the determination of the dry wet line and d t m df therefore based on the actual boundary of the tm fc trapezoid the two pixels from the leftmost end low fc and the rightmost end high fc of the dry edge as two extreme dry pixels are selected specifically two pixels from the leftmost low fc and the rightmost high fc sides of the wet edge as extreme wet pixels the four theoretical temperatures can be located by the energy balance theory combined with the meteorological station near the four extreme pixels supply information part 1 zhang et al 2005 long and singh 2012b 2 6 separation of land surface albedo with pcalep to obtain the rn and estimate the rnv and rns the land surface albedo αm unitless must be separated into vegetation albedo αv unitless and soil albedo αs unitless the scatter plot of the albedo fractional vegetation coverage αm fc is also a trapezoidal shape therefore the tbla can be applied to locate the αm fc trapezoidal boundary the modis mod43 band 5 albedo product was used in determination of αm this product provides black light albedo and white light albedo over the regions 0 3 0 7 μm 0 7 5 0 μm 0 3 5 0 μm the expression for the αm fc equation is established in eq 4 zhang et al 2005 sánchez et al 2008 long and singh 2012b 4 α m 1 f c α s f c α v similar to the eq 1 eq 4 is used to derive the fc and combine the derived equation with the eq 4 to obtain the expressions for αs and αv 5 α s α m f c d α m d f c 6 α v α m 1 f c d α m d f c 2 7 calculation and separation of rn the rn involves visible near infrared and thermal infrared bands can be

taylor 1972 from the results of the tv and ts the soil surface temperature fractional vegetation coverage ts fc and vegetation canopy temperature fractional vegetation coverage tv fc can be constructed as a trapezoid shape and the tbla can be used to determine these two types of trapezoid boundary to obtain the dry wet temperature values the bowen ratios can be calculated by the following formula 12 β si t sh t sl t sh t si 1 13 β vi t vh t vl t vh t vi 1 in eqs 12 and 13 βsi and βvi are the soil and vegetation bowen ratios unitless respectively tsh tsl are the dry boundary

trapezoidal in three test days of 2015 25apri 11aug and 20dec day of year doys 115 223 and 354 and fig 10 shows the spatial distribution of fc tv and ts from fig 10 the fc in the south region has been consistently higher in different seasons the average fc has reached over 0 7 in the whole year while the fc in north region is lower in winter 0 22 0 35 and higher in the summer 0 71 0 89 from the spatial distribution of ts and tv in three test days the ts were higher than the tv in doy115 and doy223 while the tv was higher than the ts in doy354 fig 10 corresponding the slope of tm fc trapezoid were negative in doy115 and doy223 and the slope was positive in doy354 this indicates that the slope of tm fc trapezoidal is closely related to ts and tv allocation when a specific pixel fc is determined the value of the tm that constitutes this pixel can be composed of an infinite number of combinations of tv and ts karnieli et al 2010 indicated that when water is the limiting factor for vegetation growth the tm fc correlation is negative and a positive correlation exists when energy is the limiting factor for vegetation growth in addition from fig 9 in the part of the tm fc trapezoid where the fc is lower usually this occurs in bare land and the tm are higher than 310 k for doy115 300 k for doy223 295 k for doy354 in these areas scatter vacancies often exist in the same fc area where the tm is lower than 310 k for doy115 300 k for doy223 295 k for doy354 the scatter distributions are sparse this region may be wetlands waterbodies and sandy beaches for the αm separation the tbla are used to locate the upper and lower boundaries of the αm fc trapezoid fig 11 from the spatial distribution of fc and αm in areas with low fc eastern north regions as shown in fig 10 these areas are mainly bare soil with high αm and the average αm can be close to 0 2 0 3 in areas with high fc the αm is lower and average αm is only about 0 01 0 05 for the same fc large αm could indicate relatively high tm and low soil moisture fig 11 is the scatterplot distribution of αm fc in doy115 doy223 and doy354 the envelope of the upper left pixel is not a straight line but instead a curve with a peak which becomes larger with the fc increase and then becomes smaller this is an important phenomenon which expresses the gradual transition process of the αs and αv weighted average the left side of the peak is the αs control zone and the right side zone of the peak is controlled by αv since the slope of the αm fc trapezoid is negative e g see fig 11 the αs are all higher than the αv in the doy115 doy223 and doy354 e g see fig 12 in addition it should be noted that the trapezoidal shape of the αm fc is more typical and regular than the tm fc trapezoidal figs 8 and 10 compared with tm fc trapezoidal the upper and lower boundaries of αm fc trapezoidal are not susceptible to vacancies and boundaries are also smooth for αm fc previous study indicated there still exists gradual transition soil moisture lines between the upper and lower boundaries with same soil moisture condition and same slope e g carlson et al 1994 1995 zhang et al 2005 long and singh 2012b 3 2 model validation with ec tower measurements a total of 76 cloudless days in 2015 were selected to calculate and obtain the instantaneous le of satellite transit time every day the flux station uses the average flux in the upwind source area li et al 2008 gonzalez dugo et al 2009 the instantaneous le values were converted to daily values through constant evaporative fraction method nishida et al 2003 sugita and brutsaert 1991 scatter plot of the model simulated four components in energy budgets with ec system measured values are shown in fig 13 the statistical indicators are shown in tables 1 and 2 for doy115 doy 223 and doy 354 the rmse and bias of the simulated available energy rn determined to be 18 4 w m2 and 12 8 w m2 17 5 w m2 and 11 8 w m2 14 6 w m2 and 9 3 w m2 respectively in yueyang site and 18 8 w m2 and 13 0 w m2 1 6 w m2 and 1 1 w m2 7 1 w m2 and 4 7 w m2 respectively for xsbn site the estimation of rn error may arise from several sources 1 based on the meteorological observation site in the spatial interpolation of so caused by the error 2 calculation of the atmospheric downward radiation causes errors for le rmse and bias are 32 7 w m2 and 17 3 w m2 40 5 w m2 and 26 6 w m2 35 6 w m2 and 20 1 w m2 respectively in yueyang site and 38 5 w m2 and 27 5 w m2 37 0 w m2 and 26 3 w m2 43 6 w m2 and 29 4 w m2 respectively for xsbn site the average rmse and bias are 36 3 w m2 and 21 3 w m2 for yueyang site and 39 7 w m2 and 27 7 w m2 for xsbn site in three test days for h the average rmse and bias are 27 4 w m2 and 16 3 w m2 in yueyang site and 52 3 w m2 and 37 8 w m2 for xsbn site for g rmse and bias were 8 2 w m2 and 4 5 w m2 in yueyang site and 15 1 w m2 and 10 6 w m2 for xsbn site in three test days the model provides relatively good accuracy of g due to better estimation of rn eq 10 in general pcalep provides relatively good estimates of rn and g but the model shows underestimation of le and overestimation of h in most cases tables 1 and 2 3 3 et partition performance compare with two methods due to the lack of ground observation data for e and t we compared the e and t results from the pcalep model with two types of et partition models the first type of model was proposed by zhou et al 2016 they used the ratio of apparent underlying water use efficiency uwuea to the potential underlying water use efficiency uwuep to characterization the t et in the ecosystem the second type of model was proposed by wei et al 2017 they conducted a relationship between the t et and lai in various vegetation surface types and considered t is a function of lai and fc for each land cover the model has been verified at the global scale the detailed information and calculation methods for these two types of models can be found in zhou et al 2016 and wei et al 2017 we tested the et partition results of the pcalep uwue and lai function model for 76 cloudless days it should be noted that the lai function model was originally designed for et partitioning for monthly or annual time scales wei et al 2017 here we used the same input data with pcalep and applied the model at a daily scale to ensure the three models had the same driving force and comparability fig 14 presents the scatter plot of t et value estimated by pcalep with the two models with each scatter plot representing the average value of t et over the whole region for one test day results for the r2 and rmse were 0 61 and 0 147 compared with uwue model and 0 52 and 0 189 compared with lai function model in the 76 test days the pcalep results are closer to the uwue model and larger difference to lai function model in t et estimation this may be due to the method based on lai function requires relatively few parameter inputs the model designed suitable for application in large scale and simple model physical mechanism will bring larger errors in regional scale compared with other two source models in general despite the large uncertainty exist this comparison results proves the reliable et partition performance of the pcalep model 3 4 spatial distribution patterns of e t and t et the spatial distribution of e t and t et in doy115 doy223 and doy354 are shown in fig 15 from fig 15 the energy fluxes in the study region have significant temporal and spatial differences in 2015 among them doy115 was in winter fc in the northern region was lower and higher in the southern region correspondingly the e in the northern region was higher and lower in the southern region this is due to the fact that in the northern region a large area was bare soil and rn was mostly allocated to the soil layer while in the southern region the fc was higher and the rn was mostly allocated to the vegetation layer t and e have completely different spatial patterns t in the southern region was higher and lower in the northern region for a summer day doy223 the proportions of tsouth and tnorth generally show the similar distribution the fc in the northern region began to increase in doy223 and tnorth also increased with fc in contrast enorth decreased further close to the lowest level in the whole year and the t et reached the highest value in the whole year the average value of t et in the study region was 0 69 in doy354 the spatial pattern was similar with doy115 fc in the northern region began to decrease enorth started to increase and tnorth started to decline for the southern region due to the high fc throughout the year the e and t spatial distributions show less change 3 5 model sensitivity analysis to assess the degree of influence of different input parameters on the model results a sensitivity analysis was performed to observe the change degree of le and lev le sensitivity parameters were calculated as after sánchez et al 2008 zhan et al 1996 18 s i 1 l e l e 0 l e 0 100 19 s i 2 l e v l e l e v l e 0 l e v l e 0 100 among them le and lev le are the model output le w m2 and output lev le after variable increases or decreases respectively le0 and lev le0 are the original le w m2 and original lev le based on the various input parameters of the pcalep attention was focused on 1 temperature tm ta tsd tvd tsw tvw 2 albedo αm αs and αv 3 vegetation parameters fc and lai 4 meteorological parameters so ea and u for temperature related parameters a temperature range of 2 k 2 k per gradient of 0 5 k for vegetation and albedo parameters set 20 20 every 5 gradient interval long and singh 2012b yang and shang 2013 considering the data quality of various products of modis and the range of fc and soil moisture changes doy 115 in 2015 was selected to conduct the entire sensitivity analysis 3 5 1 sensitivity to temperature parameters as seen in tables 3 and 4 figs 16 and 17 tm increased by 1 k le decreased by 9 8 and lev le decreased by 2 7 while ta increased by 1 k le increased by 11 4 and lev le decreased by 4 7 this is due to the change in tm which moves the dry wet boundaries of the tm fc trapezoid and this change has a negative effect on le and lev le the positive effect of ta on le and negative effect on lev le due to the increase of ta will increase the atmospheric long wave radiation and increase the rn eq 7 long and singh 2012a report a 1 k increase in tm and ta could result in a 14 3 decrease and a 13 8 increase in the le estimates using the ttme model yang and shang 2013 report an increase of 1 k in tm and ta resulted in an 11 decrease and an 8 5 increase of the le estimates in addition the effect of four extreme pixel temperatures was investigated an increase of 1 k in tsd and tvd resulted in a 5 5 and 4 8 increase in estimated le for lev le increase of 1 k in tsd caused 8 2 increase in lev le but increase of 1 k in tvd caused 7 4 decrease in lev le with an increase of 1 k in tsw and tvw the le value decreases by 4 9 and 6 8 respectively for lev le when there is an increase of 1 k in tsw the lev le value decreases 6 9 but an increase of 1 k in tvw corresponding with 7 1 increase for lev le the effect of four theoretical temperatures on le and lev le due to change the four theoretical temperatures will move the dry wet boundaries of the tm fc trapezoid thus changing the slope of the upper lower boundaries and the slope of each internal point to affect the allocation of ts and tv thereby affecting the le and lev le values 3 5 2 sensitivity to albedo parameters as shown in tables 3 and 4 figs 16 and 17 an increase of 10 in αm αs and αv resulted in 2 9 0 9 and 2 5 decreases in estimated le the effect of albedo on le can be explained as follows when the albedo increases the proportion of energy reaching the land surface soil surface and vegetation surface and reflecting back to the atmosphere will increase resulting in declines of rn rns and rnv and causing a decrease in le for lev le αm shows less sensitivity with lev le 10 increase αm 1 6 decrease lev le but αs and αv shows strong influence on lev le 10 increase αs 8 3 increase lev le 10 increase αv 8 7 decrease lev le the αs and αv mainly affects lev le by affecting the rn allocation proportion of the soil and vegetation layers eqs 8 and 9 3 5 3 sensitivity to vegetation the impact of vegetation parameters have consistent effects on le and lev le when lai and fc increased by 10 le increased by 8 and 8 9 respectively lev le increased by 8 8 and 9 9 respectively tables 3 and 4 figs 16 and 17 3 5 4 sensitivity to meteorological parameters three meteorological parameters were selected for sensitivity analysis so u and ea the so showed a strong and positive impact on le where an increase of 5 10 15 20 in so resulted in 4 7 9 4 14 0 and 18 4 increases in le due to so does not participate in the calculation of energy allocation so does not affect the estimation of lev le the ea showed weak and positive impact on le and lev le an increase of 5 10 15 20 in ea resulted in 0 7 1 6 2 4 and 3 increases in le and 0 1 0 5 0 9 and 1 3 increases in lev le for u an increase of 5 10 15 20 in u resulted in a 2 1 4 6 3 8 6 decrease in le and 1 0 1 9 2 7 3 5 increases in lev le in general for le estimates pcalep is sensitive to so fc ta tm and not very sensitive to ea and u model exhibits general sensitivity to albedo parameters for et partition pcalep is very sensitive to fc lai tsd tvd tsw tvw αs and αv not sensitive to αm tm and meteorological parameters 4 further discussion 4 1 pcalep model performance comparison with different two source models to evaluate the model performance we compared the le estimation results from pcalep with the original pcaca model zhang et al 2005 and several dual source models ttme long and singh 2012b tseb 1 choi et al 2009 tseb 2 yao et al 2017 htem yang and shang 2013 and tim choi et al 2009 the comparison results of rmse and bias values are shown in fig 18 for rn and g estimates pcalep provided the best performance compared with the six other two source models for le and h pcalep provided the slightly better simulation results pcalep model shows relatively superior model performance mainly for the following reasons 1 using the tbla to assist in positioning of tm fc trapezoidal theoretical boundaries greatly improving the reliability of boundary positioning 2 pcalep assumes tm is a non linear combination of tv and ts and decomposes the two temperatures eq 1 compared with the linear combination assumptions used in some two source models e g norman et al 1995 nishida et al 2003 yang and shang 2013 yao et al 2017 the non linear assumptions could better reflect the actual temperature mixing situation of the soil and vegetation layer 3 since iteration processes are not required in pcalep pcalep avoids the large uncertainty caused by the iterative process which was widely used in tseb model many previous studies have shown that the priestley taylor coefficient estimated based on the iterative process in the tseb model will cause the model to overestimate t and underestimate e e g norman et al 1995 yang et al 2015a b gan and gao 2015 the pcalep without using an iterative process will undoubtedly improve model performance however it should be noted that the results shows an underestimation of le and an overestimation of h in most cases for yueyang farmland station le was underestimated 17 3 w m2 26 6 w m2 20 1 w m2 respectively in doy 115 223 and 354 while for xsbn forest station le was underestimated 27 5 w m2 26 3 w m2 and 29 4 w m2 this may be due to the uncertainty in the weighted sum assumption of the component temperatures and albedos eqs 1 6 therefore for the further improvement of the pcalep the uncertainty and reliability of the assumption needs to be carefully evaluated in addition from the verification results of et partition the pcalep model also showed reliable and robustness in estimation of the e and t the t et varies from 0 52 to 0 75 in the 76 days of vegetables and rice fields er raki et al 2010 investigated t et in an olive field with results showing t et ranges from 0 51 0 79 poblete echeverría and ortega farias 2012 estimated t et of 0 69 in a vineyard field pcalep shows comparable results in farmland compared with previous studies for a forested field the t et varies from 0 63 to 0 86 in the 76 days calculation compared with raz yaseef et al 2012 and wilson et al 2001 the pcalep model shows some overestimation about 25 40 nevertheless it is to be noted that errors caused by ec observations and spatial scale matching between ec and modis imagery pixel are not negligible foken 2008 reported ec observations will bring 5 20 as typical error levels in addition the modis imagery resolution used in this study was 1 1km although three ec devices were used at both the yueyang station and xsbn station to cover the large areas surface flux but the ec footprints still didn t match the modis pixels very well more important ec observations have serious energy closure problems where the ec closure of this study was 0 82 at yueyang site and 0 79 at xsbn site this energy closure problems is due to the ec method not being able to capture large eddies and can only capture small eddies near the ground surface wilson 2002 foken 2008 although twine et al 2000 proposed two methods to solve the energy closure problem by calculating the residual of the energy balance re and retaining the measured bowen ratio br this can t fundamentally solve the ec energy closure problem lastly inaccurate observations from ground based meteorological stations e g so ea ta and errors from modis imagery e g tm fc αm also cause large uncertainties in the modeling results therefore subsequent studies can further reduce the uncertainty of pcalep based on the matching of rs imagery and ec data on spatial scales improve the accuracy of ec and meteorological factors observations 4 2 pcalep model application conditions the pcalep model assumes the soil under a single type of vegetation and the adjacent soils constitute the smallest unit of the pcalep model the model radiation source heat source may not be the same indicating the ts and tv can be different so the tm can be separated due to the expansion of the vegetation root system and the lateral seepage of the soil moisture the soil layer water conditions and the vegetation root layer water conditions should belong to the same source moran et al 1994 1997 the uncertainty of this hypothesis comes from the physical mechanism of the pcalep for example if the study region includes villages and farmlands or have large areas of bare land and water bodies with similar area proportions where the patch distribution of soil and vegetation definitely have very different soil moisture conditions in this case the patch model has an advantage over pcalep which is based on two source energy mixing hypothesis as a result when applying the pcalep model the study region requires a full range of land surface types and vegetation coverage 4 3 advantages of the pcalep 1 the pcalep requires only four extreme pixel impedance calculations which greatly reduces the large uncertainty caused by complex impedance calculations for all pixels in pcalep the tm were separated and then combined with the measured values of the meteorological factors in dry wet point to calculate the four theoretical temperatures the meteorological data for these four points can be obtained through the observation of the nearby meteorological station 2 the tbla overcomes the uncertainty of the dry wet boundaries location greatly reducing the uncertainty of the extreme pixel selection the tbla shows good positioning accuracy to locate wet edges where the discrete and uneven scatter distribution cause difficult to locate and fully exploits the advantages of iterative calculations and regression analyses it not only excludes the effect of anomalous scatter on the boundary location but also maximizes the scatter numbers inside the trapezoid furthermore tbla can be applied to various trapezoidal feature spaces such as αm fc ts fc tv fc etc and various trapezoidal framework based two source models such as ttme htem eteml etc 3 pcalep model requires both relatively fewer and more easily accessible inputs the model requires two type sources of parameter inputs one from remote sensing images tm fc αm lai and these parameters are easily accessible from websites the other types of parameters are meteorological factors vpd so ea u and ta could be derived from ground based meteorological station and spatial interpolation or obtained from meteorological data sets 4 4 limitations of pcalep 1 the difficulty in quantitative remote sensing based regional surface flux lies in the acquisition of non remote sensing parameters which are particularly challenging since some of these parameters are very important for example sensitivity analyses show that the so plays a decisive role in calculating of le but so is obtained from spatial interpolation for multiple ground meteorological stations if there are insufficient numbers of meteorological stations in the study area or the observation data are not sufficiently precise this will result in a large error to the model calculation results 2 due to the limitation of monitoring methods this study has not evaluated the et partition performance with measured values such as an isotope technique later research may further validate the e and t results of the pcalep model on different surface conditions and climates 5 conclusions 1 this paper proposes a trapezoidal framework based two source model pcalep the pcalep model estimates the surface energy balance components based on the newly developed tbla method tbla provides accurate and robust positioning for dry wet boundaries of tm fc trapezoidal which greatly reduces the model uncertainty caused by the extreme pixels selection 2 the pcalep model simulates overall accuracy for rmse and bias for each variable as rn of 16 8 w m2 and 11 3 w m2 for g of 8 2 w m2 and 4 5 w m2 for le of 36 3 w m2 and 21 3 w m2 for h of 27 4 w m2 and 16 3 w m2 respectively in yueyang site and rn of 4 1 w m2 and 2 5 w m2 for g of 15 1 w m2 and 10 6 w m2 for le of 39 7 w m2 and 27 7 w m2 for h of 52 3 w m2 and 37 8 w m2 respectively in xsbn site in three test days the model provides higher accuracy compared with several other two source models 3 the model simulation of t et in the study area in 2015 was 0 69 demonstrating the dominant importance of t in total et t et results comparison with uwue model zhou et al 2016 and lai function model wei et al 2017 show that pcalep can provide reliable et partition estimates 4 the spatial distribution results show that enorth was higher in winter and lower in summer tnorth was lower in winter and higher in summer due to the high fc throughout the year in the southern region the tsouth shows higher level and a lower level of esouth in annual year 5 sensitivity analyses suggest that the greatest impacts on simulation le results are fc tm and so followed by albedo related parameters and the least affected are some meteorological parameters such as ea and u for et partition pcalep is very sensitive to fc

5254,this study evaluated the effect of data intermittency and log normality on the merging of radar and the rain gauge rain rate field by cokriging the data from gwanaksan radar and rain gauges within the radar umbrella were used in this study a total of four different cases of cokriging results were generated and compared by considering one or both of the data intermittency and log normality the results confirmed that the quality of the merged rain rate field could be improved by considering both the data intermittency and the log normality in particular the data log normality was found to have a higher impact on the cokriging result than the data intermittency keywords intermittency log normality merging cokriging 1 introduction the value of high quality rain rate data in the fields of meteorology and hydrology cannot be overemphasized the rainfall information is a key input data in many hydrological analyses with direct impact on the quality of the analysis results wilson et al 1979 milly and eagleson 1988 entekhabi et al 1999 the rainfall information also plays an important role in our daily lives as well as in many industries lave 1963 stoppa and hess 2003 sivakumar 2017 forecasts of extreme rainfall are also very important for the prevention of various disasters like inundation and landslides those rainfall forecasts are used as an important input for flash flood warning systems landslide forecast systems etc alfieri et al 2011 martens et al 2013 traditionally the rainfall information has been collected by rain gauges most countries have thus tried to increase the rain gauge density as well as the quality of rainfall information for example the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa has secured and managed a nation wide rain gauge network for accurate flood prediction kuligowski 1997 in japan more than 1300 rain gauges are operated by the japan meteorological administration to capture the rain rate distribution for flood prediction fukami 2005 meteo france also operates more than 900 rain gauges to capture real time rain rate information over france champeaux et al 2011 in korea modern rain gauges were introduced in 1910 to measure daily rainfall at 10 locations over the korean peninsula nema 2004 there are now more than 700 rain gauges nationwide with a density of about 141 8 km2 gauge which collect rainfall information every 10 min molit 2015 however there are still many who are not satisfied with the rainfall information produced by these high density rain gauge networks worldwide thorpe et al 1979 groisman and legates 1994 yang et al 1998 in korea the complaints have mostly been of low rain gauge density in mountainous regions limited information in the near shore regions increased frequency of localized heavy storms etc for example rain gauges have been mostly introduced in urban areas and flat agricultural areas where accessibility is good for gauge management very complex and irregular terrain over the korean peninsula has been a barrier to increase the rain gauge density evenly in space which also deteriorates the quality of areal average rainfall data as an input for the flood warning system yoo et al 2008 k water 2010 lee et al 2013 the orographic effect which is believed to be an important factor that enhances the rain rate in mountainous regions cannot be easily captured due to the limited rainfall information chua and bras 1982 dingman et al 1988 singh and kumar 1997 yoo et al 2004 yun et al 2009 ku et al 2015 that most of the big cities in korea are located on the sea is another problem of rain gauges a very limited number of rain gauges are available from just a few islands in the near shore region in particular the urban flood can be a serious problem in the case that the storm is approaching from the sea which unfortunately is usual in korea increase in the frequency of localized heavy rainfall must be another reason for complaint about the rain gauge information recent records show that those heavy rainfall events are increasing and some of them have never been experienced in the past nema 2007 sdi 2011 kma 2013 these localized heavy rainfall events cannot be effectively captured by the existing sparse rain gauge network this is one important reason why radars are introduced moct 2007 kma 2009 however without enough information about the rain gauge rainfall the radar information cannot obtain enough quality to be applied for flood forecasting radar has been an attractive tool in the fields of hydrology and meteorology in korea the ministry of land infrastructure and transport molit operates its own radar network which is different from that of the korea meteorological administration kma the radar information i e radar rain rate produced by molit is used for the flood warning systems for large river basins recently flash flood warning systems in urban areas are also being developed based on the molit radar information molit 2015 however it is still a matter of doubt if the radar rain rate has sufficient quality to be applied as input to those warning systems up to the present the radar rain rate has not been assumed to have sufficient quality for various hydrological applications velasco forero et al 2009 berndt et al 2014 yoo et al 2016 as the radar is a remote sensing tool and does not directly measure the target quantity the information collected by the radar can have various types of errors these are related to radar beam attenuation beam blocking non meteorological echoes mean field bias etc thus the radar quality is generally lower than that of rain gauges the amount of error is also dependent upon the storm type variation of rain drop size distribution abnormal bean propagation etc hitschfeld and bordan 1954 chandrasekar and bringi 1988 chandrasekar et al 1990 steiner et al 1999 lafont and guillemet 2004 these problems definitely degrade the quality of the radar rain rate as well as the reliability of the radar itself many studies have focused on the radar qpe quantitative precipitation estimation to minimize the error involved in the radar rain rate brandes 1975 seo et al 1999 krajewski and smith 2002 uijlenhoet et al 2003 henschke et al 2009 rendon et al 2011 kim and yoo 2014a kim et al 2015 various radar equations have been proposed to relate the radar parameter with the radar rain rate under a specific storm type and recently some synthetic algorithms have also been proposed to overcome the limitation of using just one radar equation ryzhkov et al 2005 cifelli et al 2011 the real time mean field bias correction based on the kalman filter has been a popular topic anagnostou and krajewski 1999 anagnostou et al 1999 chumchean et al 2006 kim and yoo 2014b yoo et al 2014 and a system for real time determination of the radar equation is also being used in the radar operation kma 2011a all of these efforts are to improve the quality of radar data however there still remains large scope for additional improvement recently as an attempt to improve the radar rain rate one step further merging of the radar rain rate and rain gauge rain rate has become a popular topic krajewski 1987 azimi zonooz et al 1989 kim et al 2008 yoo and park 2008 seo 2012 berndt et al 2014 hasan et al 2016 the goal of those studies was simply to combine the very accurate rain gauge rain rate data which is unfortunately sparse in space with the radar rain rate which is continuous in space but less accurate if this merging is successful very accurate and spatially continuous rain rate data can be obtained gandin and kagan 1974 journel and huijbregts 1978 creutin et al 1988 todini 2001 goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 cokriging is the most popular technique used for this purpose of merging conditional merging ehret 2003 sinclair and pegram 2005 yoo and park 2008 gaussian merging williams and rasmussen 2006 etc are also theoretically similar to cokriging a traditional method like the successive correction method cressman 1959 is also a simple but useful method now in use cokriging is a geostatistical method of combining two or more data sets to produce improved quantitative information it is assumed that most of the important characteristics of the original data are considered in the new information produced goovaerts 1997 many application cases of cokriging can be found in hydrology and meteorology these applications encompass soil moisture evaporation ground water etc as well as rainfall krajewski 1987 hevesi et al 1992 voltz and goulard 1994 cassirage and gómez hernández 1997 goovaerts 2000 sinclair and pegram 2005 yao et al 2006 mehrjardi et al 2008 pettazzi and salson 2012 similar applications can also be found in korea kim et al 2008 yoo and park 2008 yoon and bae 2013 jang et al 2015 however contrary to high expectation the results of cokriging have been rather disappointing yoo and park 2008 martens et al 2013 to merge the radar rain rate and rain gauge rain rate it is important to consider the data characteristics themselves a typical difference of these two data is that one is a point value while the other is an areal average one even though these two sensors radar and rain gauge measure the same rain rate field the data collected by them could be very different zawadzki 1975 however there are more fundamental characteristics that set the rain rate field apart from others non normality and intermittency kedem and chiu 1986 kedem et al 1990 kumar and foufoula georgiou 1994 ha and yoo 2007 if these unique characteristics are not considered in the merging of the two data sets the result may not become satisfactory oke et al 2009 karl 2010 some amount of bias can be introduced in the merged data and the quality of the merged data can also be even lower than the original data kim et al 2008 goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 as the merging techniques currently available assume that the data is continuous and gaussian data with different characteristics may not be applicable draper et al 1966 cressie 1993 the objective of this study is to propose a new method of applying cokriging to handle the intermittent and non normal rain rate data the proposed method is based on the theoretically derived second order statistics of intermittent and non normal rain rate data which is especially important to determine the structure of a variogram as the rain rate data is generally assumed to follow a log normal distribution stedinger 1980 kedem and chiu 1986 cho et al 2004 ha and yoo 2007 this study also considers log normality for handling non normal rain rate data as an application example this study considers merging the radar and rain gauge data from gwanaksan radar and rain gauges within the radar umbrella gwanaksan radar is the first meteorological radar introduced in korea and covers seoul the capital city of korea 2 theory 2 1 theory of cokriging and variogram 2 1 1 cokriging cokriging is one of the kriging methods that uses a linear combination of two or more variables to predict or generate the value at an unknown point journel and huijbregts 1978 myers 1982 goovaerts 1997 the predicted value z belongs to the primary variable z and the other variable u is called the secondary variable in general the primary variable is assumed to be of high quality but the number of data is small on the other hand the secondary variable is assumed to be of rather low quality but a lot of data are available the purpose of cokriging is to generate high quality data by combining the primary and secondary variables in order to predict the value at an unknown point with cokriging both variables should be correlated with each other cokriging can be expressed by the following linear equation 1 z i 1 n λ i z i j 1 m κ j u j where z i represents the primary variable at location i u j represents the secondary variable at location j n and m are the numbers of primary and secondary variables and λ and κ are the weighted values to be determined for primary and secondary variables the main purpose of cokriging is to determine the weighted values under the condition of unbiasedness and the least sum of square errors i e error variance first the bias b z between the predicted value z and the unknown true value z can be derived as follows 2 b z e z 1 i 1 n λ i e u j 1 m κ j as the bias should be zero the following two conditions are derived 3a 1 i 1 n λ i 0 3b j 1 m κ j 0 the error variance of cokriging is also derived as follows 4 σ ck 2 σ 2 2 c o v z i 1 n λ i z i j 1 m κ j u j v a r i 1 n λ i z i j 1 m κ j u j a variety of methods can be applied to minimize the error variance under the given constraint but when the number of variables is many the lagrange parameter method is useful this method uses an auxiliary function to make the given function have the extremal value under the given constraint the auxiliary function is defined by applying the multiplier to the constraint and adding it to the given function now the two conditions of unbiasedness and the minimum error variance can be combined into one objective function as follows 5 l λ 1 λ 2 λ n κ 1 κ 2 κ m ω 1 ω 2 σ ck 2 2 ω 1 1 i 1 n λ i 2 ω 2 j 1 m κ j where l λ 1 λ 2 λ n κ 1 κ 2 κ m ω 1 ω 2 is the lagrange function and ω 1 ω 2 are the lagrange multipliers the weighted values minimizing eq 5 are the optimal solutions to be determined for cokriging these optimal solutions can be determined by differentiating eq 5 with respect to two lagrange multipliers and weighted values as a result the following set of linear equations is derived 6a i 1 n λ i c o v z l z i j 1 m κ j c o v z l u j ω 1 c o v z 0 z l l 1 n 6b i 1 n λ i c o v u l z i j 1 m κ j c o v u l u j ω 1 c o v z 0 z l l 1 m 6c i 1 n λ i 1 6d j 1 m κ j 0 the above equations can also be expressed in matrix form 7 c z x 1 x 1 c z x 1 x n c zu x 1 x 1 c zu x 1 x m 1 0 c z x n x 1 c z x n x n c zu x n x 1 c zu x n x m 1 0 c zu x 1 x 1 c zu x n x 1 c u x 1 x 1 c u x 1 x m 0 1 c zu x 1 x m c zu x n x m c u x m x 1 c u x m x m 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 λ 1 λ n κ 1 κ m ω 1 ω 2 c z x 0 x 1 c z x 0 x n c zu x 0 x 1 c zu x 0 x m 1 0 where c zu is the covariance between two variables and x i and x i are the locations of the primary and the secondary variables respectively the size of the cokriging matrix is n m 2 n m 2 and the total number of data becomes n m 2 1 2 variogram and cross variogram the variogram is a measure to represent the similarity of data at a certain distance to make a cokriging matrix equation such as eq 7 the covariance must be estimated this can be done using the variogram and cross variogram of the primary and secondary variables first an empirical variogram should be derived to determine the theoretical variogram the empirical variogram of the univariate data can be derived using the following eq 8 8 γ h 1 2 n i 1 n r x i r x i h 2 where γ h represents the variogram as a function of the separation distance h n is the number of observation points and r x i is the observed values the cross variogram derived using both the primary and secondary variables can also be determined as follows 9 γ h 1 2 n i 1 n u x i u x i h v x i v x i h where u x i and v x i are the primary and the secondary variables respectively comparison of eqs 8 and 9 shows that the variogram and the cross variogram are very similar to each other the only difference is the number of variables used thus in the case that the two variables are identical the cross variogram becomes the variogram the variogram always has a positive value but the cross variogram can be negative if the correlation of two variables is negative with the determined empirical variograms using eqs 8 and 9 the correlation length and sill height are determined the correlation length represents the maximum separation distance that guarantees the statistically significant correlation coefficient between points the sill height is the corresponding value of variance at the correlation length the theoretical variogram is then determined by applying the correlation length and sill height to the theoretical model spherical exponential and gaussian models are generally considered as the theoretical model and in this study the gaussian model is used the gaussian model is given as follows 10 γ h c 0 g a u s s a h c 0 1 exp 3 h a 2 where c 0 is the sill height and a is the correlation length the gaussian model is known to be better for the normally distributed or highly correlated data field once the gaussian model is determined the covariance can be calculated using the following equation 11 cov h σ 2 γ h where cov h represents the covariance and σ 2 the variance once the covariance is determined the cokriging matrix equation can be composed also the weighted values of the primary and the secondary variables can be determined by solving the cokriging matrix equation 2 2 correlation coefficient according to the data intermittency and log normality 2 2 1 correlation coefficient of normally distributed and intermittent data the covariance a component of the cokriging matrix equation is affected by the correlation coefficient in general the covariance has the following relation with the correlation coefficient 12 cov x y ρ σ x σ y where cov x y is the covariance between x and y ρ is the correlation coefficient and σ x and σ y represent the standard deviation of x and y respectively the correlation coefficients vary depending on the data intermittency and probability density functions of the measurements the correlation coefficient of the normally distributed and intermittent data can be confirmed through ha and yoo 2007 the data measured at two rain gauge locations according to the rainfall characteristics can be categorized as the following three conditions a x 0 a n d y 0 b x 0 o r y 0 and c x 0 a n d y 0 ρ a and ρ b on the conditions a and b can be derived as eqs 14 and 15 using eq 13 the total probability theorem parzen 1962 13 e h y e h y x x p x x 14 ρ a p 11 e x y e x p 10 e x x 0 y 0 e y p 01 e y x 0 y 0 p 11 e x 2 p 10 e x 2 x 0 y 0 e x p 10 e x x 0

measurements are not zero ρ b ρ c it is obvious that the correlation coefficient can be changed depending on the 0 values included in the data when the data follow the normal distribution 2 2 2 correlation coefficient of log normally distributed and intermittent data the correlation coefficient reviewed in section 2 2 1 may not be applicable to non normal data rain rate data are known to follow a non normal distribution and in many cases the rain rate data are well modeled by a log normal distribution kedem and chiu 1986 shimizu and sagae 1990 also investigated the statistical characteristics of the mixed bivariate log normal distribution ha and yoo 2007 also derived the correlation coefficient of the log normally distributed and intermittent data the mixed bivariate log normal distribution is defined as follows 16 δ 2 δ 0 δ 1 δ 2 μ 1 μ 2 μ 1 μ 2 σ 1 2 σ 2 2 σ 1 2 σ 2 2 ρ where δ p x 0 y 0 and 0 δ 1 eq 16 can also be expressed as follows using the bivariate log normal joint distribution function h such as the univariate log normal distribution function f or g 17 f x λ 1 x μ 1 σ 1 2 x 0 g x λ 1 y μ 2 σ 2 2 y 0 h x y λ 2 x y μ 1 μ 2 σ 1 2 σ 2 2 ρ x 0 y 0 where λ 1 μ σ 2 represents the log normal distribution with mean μ and variance σ 2 and λ 2 μ 1 μ 2 σ 1 2 σ 2 2 ρ represents the bivariate log normal distribution with means μ 1 and μ 2 variances σ 1 2 and σ 2 2 and correlation coefficient ρ the moments under the condition a x 0 a n d y 0 when x or y follows the log normal distribution can be derived as follows 18 e x a exp μ 1 σ 1 2 2 e x 2 a exp 2 μ 1 2 σ 1 2 e y a exp μ 2 σ 2 2 2 e y 2 a exp 2 μ 2 2 σ 2 2 also the expectation of xy under the condition a in the joint distribution of x y given by the bivariate log normal distribution is expressed as follows 19 e x y a exp μ 1 μ 2 σ 1 2 2 σ 1 σ 2 ρ σ 2 2 2 using eqs 18 and 19 the correlation coefficient ρ a is derived as eq 20 by the definition of the correlation coefficient of eq 12 20 ρ a exp ρ σ 1 σ 2 1 exp σ 1 2 1 1 2 exp σ 2 2 1 1 2 ρ b and ρ c can also be derived in the same way as in section 2 2 1 if the conditions e x k x 0 y 0 and e y k x 0 y 0 are given the above results show that the correlation coefficient is dependent upon both the data distribution function and zero measurements this will affect the covariance the shape of the variogram and finally the results of the cokriging 3 application examples 3 1 data this study used the gwanaksan radar data and rain gauge data within the radar umbrella to evaluate the effect of data intermittency and log normality on the cokriging as the first weather radar in korea gwanaksan weather radar is located in the southern part of seoul korea at latitude 37 26 28 longitude 126 57 58 and elevation 637 m the gwanaksan radar is an s band radar whose observation range is 240 km it has a maximum resolution of 500 m 500 m but in this study the 4 km 4 km data were applied to the cokriging this is to prevent the cokriging result being severely smoothed or overestimated when the number of grids is too large goovaerts 2000 the marshall and palmer 1948 relationship was used to convert the radar reflectivity data to the radar rain rate the radar rain rate was also corrected by the g r ratio to increase the efficiency of the merging rain rate data measured every 10 min at each rain gauge station were applied to the cokriging a total of 337 rain gauges are located within the umbrella of gwanaksan radar but only 83 rain gauges were used for the merging of the rain rate field this is to prevent the overestimation of rain rate and too large rainfall spatial coverage when the rain gauge network is dense the remaining rain gauges were used to evaluate the merged rain rate field fig 1 shows the location of gwanaksan radar site and rain gauges within the radar umbrella as can be seen in this figure it is assumed that the rain gauges are evenly distributed over the radar umbrella a total of four rainfall events were considered in this study which were those observed on september 11 2010 july 28 2011 july 19 2012 and september 17 2012 the monthly weather review of the korea meteorological administration kma 2010 explains that the rainfall event during the period of september 11 to 12 2010 was due to a low pressure system located at the southern part of the korean peninsula the rainfall event during the period of july 26 to 28 2011 was due to an unstable atmospheric condition kma 2010 kma 2011b the rainfall event during the period of july 18 to 19 2012 was due to typhoon khanun and the rainfall event observed on september 17 2012 was due to typhoon sanba kma 2012 in this study as examples only five rain rate fields were selected for further application these were those observed at 4 30 september 11 2010 event 1 at 8 30 september 11 2010 event 2 at 9 00 july 28 2011 event 3 at 5 00 july 19 2012 event 4 and at 12 20 september 17 2012 event 5 fig 2 shows the radar images and gauge rain rate fields for these five rain rate fields fig 2 in particular shows a somewhat circular pattern to the rain gauge rate fields around the rain gauge station this is because the anisotropy was not considered in the generation of the rain gauge rain rate field in this study a radar rain rate of less than 0 5 mm hr was assumed to be no rain this was to consider the minimum detectable rain rate of the rain gauges within the radar umbrella the ratios of no rain in these rain rate fields are 76 5 for event 1 79 5 for event 2 92 3 for event 3 76 4 for event 4 and 68 3 for event 5 these rain rate data were assumed to follow a log normal distribution thus in the cokriging both the original data and the natural log transformed data were considered for comparison the zero measurements were set to be unchanged when considering the data log normality table 1 shows the means variances and maximum values of gauge and radar rain rate data considered in this study table 1 shows that the means of radar rain rate are similar to those of the rain gauge rain rate which is actually the result of the g r correction on the other hand the variance of the rain gauge rain rate was found to be much higher than those of the radar rain rate this can also be confirmed in the comparison of the rain gauge and radar rain rate fields see fig 2 where the radar rain rate field is more smooth and continuous which means its variance is smaller than that of the rain gauge rain rate field after taking logarithms of the original data as the log transformed data smoothens the data field the basic statistics like the mean variance and maximum value are found to become very similar to each other 3 2 determination of variograms cokriging requires the variogram for the primary variable the variogram for the secondary one and the cross variogram for both the primary and secondary variables in this study the rain gauge rain rate was considered as the primary variable and the radar rain rate the secondary one when deriving the variogram for the primary variable the point rain gauge rain rate data were used but when deriving the cross variogram the rain gauge data were first spatially distributed to match the data structure for the radar data a total of four different cases of variograms were derived in this study the first case case 1 was those without consideration for both the rainfall intermittency and log normality the second case case 2 with consideration for only the rainfall intermittency the third case case 3 with consideration for only the rainfall log normality and the last case case 4 with consideration for both the rainfall intermittency and log normality fig 3 compares variograms derived for the rain gauge and radar data and the cross variogram for event 1 also figs 4 7 are the same but for events 2 5 respectively in these figures the dotted line represents the empirical variogram while the solid line represents the theoretical variogram derived by applying the gaussian model among the variograms in these figures those for the rain gauge data were found to be rather wiggly mainly due to the limited number of data available on the other hand the variograms for the radar data were all found to be rather smooth and the cross variograms were in between the two the sill heights for the cross variograms were also estimated to be in between those for the radar data and the rain gauge data quite interestingly the correlation lengths of the cross variogram were estimated to be much longer than those for the radar and rain gauge data in fact this result is natural as the cross variogram can consider the storm movement over time comparison of the four cases of variograms also shows some interesting differences first in the cases considering the data characteristics the gaussian model fits better this result was the same even for the case of considering only the data intermittency which is more distinct for the rain gauge data the relative roles of data intermittency and log normality when deriving the variogram were found to be different depending on the rainfall event the effect of rainfall intermittency seems more distinct in the variograms of the radar data but the effect of data log normality seems more or less the same in both the radar and rain gauge data the sill heights when considering both the data intermittency and log normality seem to be similar to those that just consider the data log normality table 2 summarizes the correlation lengths for all three rainfall events along with the sill heights table 2 shows that the sill heights of case 1 were found to be higher than those for the other cases which is the same for all the rainfall events also the sill heights of the rain gauge data were estimated to be much higher than those for the radar data which seems to be the result reflecting the difference between the point value and areal average value the sill heights of the cross variograms were all determined to have values in between those for the radar and rain gauge data the correlation length was found to be longer in the cases with consideration for the data characteristics in particular for the rain gauge data the correlation length was longer in the cases of considering the data log normality than that of considering the data intermittency but the exactly opposite result was derived for the radar data due to the difference of point data and areal average data the relative effect of rainfall intermittency and log normality seems to become opposite however the longest correlation length was derived when considering both the data intermittency and log normality that is both considerations of data intermittency and log normality increase the correlation length the above findings show that consideration of the data characteristics can significantly change the shape of the variogram in this application with the radar and rain gauge rain rate in both cases of considering the data intermittency and log normality the correlation length was increased on the other hand when considering the data characteristics the sill height of the variogram was decreased however when considering both the data intermittency and log normality the sill heights were found to be a bit higher than those when considering only the data log normality 3 3 results and discussions in this part of the study the radar rain rate and rain gauge rain rate were merged by applying the cokriging technique considering the variograms derived in the previous section such as in figs 3 7 in particular when considering cases 3 and 4 the logarithmic data were first merged and then the antilogarithmic field was derived also the merged rain rate of less than 0 5 mm hr was considered as no rain to consider the minimum detectable rain rate of those rain gauges considered in this study fig 8 compares the cokriging results of four cases with respect to each rain rate field considered in this study from left the case without considering any data characteristics case 1 the case considering only the data intermittency case 2 the case considering only the data log normality case 3 and the case considering both the data intermittency and log normality case 4 in fact all of the merged rain rate fields seem to be more or less similar to the original radar rain rate field however somewhat specific differences could also be found such as the correction of the beam blocked area and the filling of the missing points also more markedly the rainfall coverage could be compared and as a result it was maximized when considering both the rainfall intermittency and log normality more detailed examination of fig 8 shows that the spatial distribution of the merged rain rate field without considering any of the data characteristics was most similar to the original radar rain rate field this is simply because the characteristics of the ground data were not properly considered in the merging due to this reason the rainfall coverage remained smaller than other cases that considered the data characteristics the area of high rain rate was also found smaller than for the other cases basically consideration of data characteristics increased the correlation length which also increased the rainfall coverage as well as the area of high rain rate when considering the data intermittency even though the spatial distribution of the merged data field was found similar to that without considering any of the data characteristics the area of high rain rate was significantly increased in particular for events 3 4 and 5 it is easy to detect the increased area of high rain rate colored by red this is mainly because considering the data intermittency increased the correlation length of the merged rain rate field the effect of data intermittency also varied depending on the rain rate field and event 5 with many scattered rain rate areas showed somewhat unsmooth results of merging the change was also found obvious when considering the data log normality in particular the effect of the ground rain rate data in the merged rain rate field could be detected very easily as a result the area of rain became larger than those for the previous two cases in particular the beam blocking area of the radar rain rate was significantly implemented by the rain gauge data even though the rain rate itself in this area was not as high as that of the rain gauge data similar to the case of considering the data intermittency considering the data log normality also increased the area of high rain rate the case of considering both the data intermittency and log normality showed a similar result to that of considering the data log normality only however in this case the area of high rain rate was found larger than for the other cases also the rain rate of the beam blocking area became much higher than that in the case of considering the data log normality only overall the effect of merging was found most distinctly in this case of considering both the data intermittency and log normality in fact this was a natural result of the longer correlation length which had been derived as a result of considering the data characteristics that is by properly considering the data characteristics it is possible to improve the quality of merging and to produce a more realistic data field table 3 summarizes the results in fig 8 by rmse and bs when estimating the rmse of the merged data field only the ground data which had not been used for merging were used the bs considers only the bias of the merged data but the rmse considers both the bias and randomness using these two statistics the quality of the merged field can easily be evaluated table 3 additionally provides the mean and maximum values of the merged data field for reference first table 3 shows that the mean of the merged rain rate field without considering the data characteristics was found to be smaller by 14 19 than the ground data this was mainly because of the short correlation length on the other hand when considering the data intermittency or data log normality the mean of the merged rain rate field became more or less the same as that of the ground data when considering both the data intermittency and log normality even though there is a case where the mean of the merged field was higher than the ground data by about 15 case 4 of event 1 the mean of the merged rain rate field was found to be very close to the ground data the maximum value of the merged data field was found to be smaller than that of the ground data in all cases considered in this study in some cases the maximum value of the merged data field was found to be similar to the ground data event 2 but in some other cases events 1 5 the maximum value was far smaller than the ground data cokriging seems to over smooth the data field even though the log normality was considered as the rmse is estimated by considering both the bias and variability of the merged data the difference of mean and variance of the merged data from those of the ground data can also be expected with the rmse for example the rmses of the merged data without considering any of the data characteristics were found to be mostly larger than those with considering the data characteristics as an example for event 1 the rmse of the merged data without considering any data characteristics was estimated to be 3 123 but was 3 019 decrease by 3 3 when considering the data intermittency 2 921 decrease by 6 5 when considering the data log normality and 2 860 decrease by 8 42 when considering both the data intermittency and log normality for events 2 and 4 the maximum rmse decrease was by about 10 when considering both the data intermittency and log normality it is also noticeable that the effect of considering the data log normality on the rmse was higher than that of considering the data intermittency in some cases like event 3 somewhat disappointing results could be found that is the rmse of the merged data without considering the data characteristics was found to be smaller than those of considering the data intermittency and or data log normality this result was mainly due to the small rainfall coverage which resulted in rather large difference between the merged data and the ground field consideration of data characteristics especially the data log normality was found to quite significantly enlarge the rainfall coverage which could lead to a higher rmse as the rainfall coverage was originally small the above results indicate that the cokriging result is mostly better in the case of considering the data characteristics in particular the consideration of the data log normality was found to have higher impact on the cokriging result than the data intermittency this result is especially meaningful as the rain rate data do not strictly follow a log normal distribution once the proper distribution function for the rain rate data could be applied a better one step result might be derived 4 summary and conclusions this study evaluated the effects of data intermittency and log normality on the merging of the rain rate field the cokriging was used as a tool for merging and as an example the radar and rain gauge rain rate data from gwanaksan radar and rain gauges within the radar umbrella were merged and evaluated in this study the variogram which is a decisive component in the application of the cokriging was also derived separately by considering one or both of the data intermittency and data log normality to evaluate the change of its shape the derived variograms were then applied to the merging of radar and rain gauge data and finally the merged rain rate fields were compared with the ground data the results can be summarized as follows first in the cases of considering the data characteristics the gaussian model was found to fit better for the empirical variograms when considering the data intermittency and non normality the correlation length was found to be longer on the other hand when considering the data characteristics the sill height of the variogram was found to be decreased second when considering the data characteristics the rainfall coverage of the merged rain rate field generated by applying the cokriging was found to be larger the case of considering both the data intermittency and non normality resulted in the effect of merging being found most distinctly in fact this is a reasonable result as considering the data characteristics lengthened the correlation length finally it was found that by considering both the data intermittency and log normality the merged rain rate field generated was most similar to the ground rain rate field the comparison of bss and rmses also confirmed this result when considering the data characteristics the mean of the merged rain rate field became more or less the same as that of the ground data the rmses of the merged data with considering any of the data characteristics were also found to be smaller than for those not in particular the consideration of the data log normality was found to have higher impact on the cokriging result than the data intermittency the results in this study show that consideration of the data intermittency and log normality could improve the quality of the merged rain rate field however there remains a hidden problem that the rain rate data may not fully follow a log normal distribution in the merging of radar and rain gauge rain rate data data anisotropy is also another serious problem that should be considered properly considering all of these characteristics of the rain rate data in the merging could be expected to further improve the quality of the rain rate field declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

5254,this study evaluated the effect of data intermittency and log normality on the merging of radar and the rain gauge rain rate field by cokriging the data from gwanaksan radar and rain gauges within the radar umbrella were used in this study a total of four different cases of cokriging results were generated and compared by considering one or both of the data intermittency and log normality the results confirmed that the quality of the merged rain rate field could be improved by considering both the data intermittency and the log normality in particular the data log normality was found to have a higher impact on the cokriging result than the data intermittency keywords intermittency log normality merging cokriging 1 introduction the value of high quality rain rate data in the fields of meteorology and hydrology cannot be overemphasized the rainfall information is a key input data in many hydrological analyses with direct impact on the quality of the analysis results wilson et al 1979 milly and eagleson 1988 entekhabi et al 1999 the rainfall information also plays an important role in our daily lives as well as in many industries lave 1963 stoppa and hess 2003 sivakumar 2017 forecasts of extreme rainfall are also very important for the prevention of various disasters like inundation and landslides those rainfall forecasts are used as an important input for flash flood warning systems landslide forecast systems etc alfieri et al 2011 martens et al 2013 traditionally the rainfall information has been collected by rain gauges most countries have thus tried to increase the rain gauge density as well as the quality of rainfall information for example the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa has secured and managed a nation wide rain gauge network for accurate flood prediction kuligowski 1997 in japan more than 1300 rain gauges are operated by the japan meteorological administration to capture the rain rate distribution for flood prediction fukami 2005 meteo france also operates more than 900 rain gauges to capture real time rain rate information over france champeaux et al 2011 in korea modern rain gauges were introduced in 1910 to measure daily rainfall at 10 locations over the korean peninsula nema 2004 there are now more than 700 rain gauges nationwide with a density of about 141 8 km2 gauge which collect rainfall information every 10 min molit 2015 however there are still many who are not satisfied with the rainfall information produced by these high density rain gauge networks worldwide thorpe et al 1979 groisman and legates 1994 yang et al 1998 in korea the complaints have mostly been of low rain gauge density in mountainous regions limited information in the near shore regions increased frequency of localized heavy storms etc for example rain gauges have been mostly introduced in urban areas and flat agricultural areas where accessibility is good for gauge management very complex and irregular terrain over the korean peninsula has been a barrier to increase the rain gauge density evenly in space which also deteriorates the quality of areal average rainfall data as an input for the flood warning system yoo et al 2008 k water 2010 lee et al 2013 the orographic effect which is believed to be an important factor that enhances the rain rate in mountainous regions cannot be easily captured due to the limited rainfall information chua and bras 1982 dingman et al 1988 singh and kumar 1997 yoo et al 2004 yun et al 2009 ku et al 2015 that most of the big cities in korea are located on the sea is another problem of rain gauges a very limited number of rain gauges are available from just a few islands in the near shore region in particular the urban flood can be a serious problem in the case that the storm is approaching from the sea which unfortunately is usual in korea increase in the frequency of localized heavy rainfall must be another reason for complaint about the rain gauge information recent records show that those heavy rainfall events are increasing and some of them have never been experienced in the past nema 2007 sdi 2011 kma 2013 these localized heavy rainfall events cannot be effectively captured by the existing sparse rain gauge network this is one important reason why radars are introduced moct 2007 kma 2009 however without enough information about the rain gauge rainfall the radar information cannot obtain enough quality to be applied for flood forecasting radar has been an attractive tool in the fields of hydrology and meteorology in korea the ministry of land infrastructure and transport molit operates its own radar network which is different from that of the korea meteorological administration kma the radar information i e radar rain rate produced by molit is used for the flood warning systems for large river basins recently flash flood warning systems in urban areas are also being developed based on the molit radar information molit 2015 however it is still a matter of doubt if the radar rain rate has sufficient quality to be applied as input to those warning systems up to the present the radar rain rate has not been assumed to have sufficient quality for various hydrological applications velasco forero et al 2009 berndt et al 2014 yoo et al 2016 as the radar is a remote sensing tool and does not directly measure the target quantity the information collected by the radar can have various types of errors these are related to radar beam attenuation beam blocking non meteorological echoes mean field bias etc thus the radar quality is generally lower than that of rain gauges the amount of error is also dependent upon the storm type variation of rain drop size distribution abnormal bean propagation etc hitschfeld and bordan 1954 chandrasekar and bringi 1988 chandrasekar et al 1990 steiner et al 1999 lafont and guillemet 2004 these problems definitely degrade the quality of the radar rain rate as well as the reliability of the radar itself many studies have focused on the radar qpe quantitative precipitation estimation to minimize the error involved in the radar rain rate brandes 1975 seo et al 1999 krajewski and smith 2002 uijlenhoet et al 2003 henschke et al 2009 rendon et al 2011 kim and yoo 2014a kim et al 2015 various radar equations have been proposed to relate the radar parameter with the radar rain rate under a specific storm type and recently some synthetic algorithms have also been proposed to overcome the limitation of using just one radar equation ryzhkov et al 2005 cifelli et al 2011 the real time mean field bias correction based on the kalman filter has been a popular topic anagnostou and krajewski 1999 anagnostou et al 1999 chumchean et al 2006 kim and yoo 2014b yoo et al 2014 and a system for real time determination of the radar equation is also being used in the radar operation kma 2011a all of these efforts are to improve the quality of radar data however there still remains large scope for additional improvement recently as an attempt to improve the radar rain rate one step further merging of the radar rain rate and rain gauge rain rate has become a popular topic krajewski 1987 azimi zonooz et al 1989 kim et al 2008 yoo and park 2008 seo 2012 berndt et al 2014 hasan et al 2016 the goal of those studies was simply to combine the very accurate rain gauge rain rate data which is unfortunately sparse in space with the radar rain rate which is continuous in space but less accurate if this merging is successful very accurate and spatially continuous rain rate data can be obtained gandin and kagan 1974 journel and huijbregts 1978 creutin et al 1988 todini 2001 goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 cokriging is the most popular technique used for this purpose of merging conditional merging ehret 2003 sinclair and pegram 2005 yoo and park 2008 gaussian merging williams and rasmussen 2006 etc are also theoretically similar to cokriging a traditional method like the successive correction method cressman 1959 is also a simple but useful method now in use cokriging is a geostatistical method of combining two or more data sets to produce improved quantitative information it is assumed that most of the important characteristics of the original data are considered in the new information produced goovaerts 1997 many application cases of cokriging can be found in hydrology and meteorology these applications encompass soil moisture evaporation ground water etc as well as rainfall krajewski 1987 hevesi et al 1992 voltz and goulard 1994 cassirage and gómez hernández 1997 goovaerts 2000 sinclair and pegram 2005 yao et al 2006 mehrjardi et al 2008 pettazzi and salson 2012 similar applications can also be found in korea kim et al 2008 yoo and park 2008 yoon and bae 2013 jang et al 2015 however contrary to high expectation the results of cokriging have been rather disappointing yoo and park 2008 martens et al 2013 to merge the radar rain rate and rain gauge rain rate it is important to consider the data characteristics themselves a typical difference of these two data is that one is a point value while the other is an areal average one even though these two sensors radar and rain gauge measure the same rain rate field the data collected by them could be very different zawadzki 1975 however there are more fundamental characteristics that set the rain rate field apart from others non normality and intermittency kedem and chiu 1986 kedem et al 1990 kumar and foufoula georgiou 1994 ha and yoo 2007 if these unique characteristics are not considered in the merging of the two data sets the result may not become satisfactory oke et al 2009 karl 2010 some amount of bias can be introduced in the merged data and the quality of the merged data can also be even lower than the original data kim et al 2008 goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 as the merging techniques currently available assume that the data is continuous and gaussian data with different characteristics may not be applicable draper et al 1966 cressie 1993 the objective of this study is to propose a new method of applying cokriging to handle the intermittent and non normal rain rate data the proposed method is based on the theoretically derived second order statistics of intermittent and non normal rain rate data which is especially important to determine the structure of a variogram as the rain rate data is generally assumed to follow a log normal distribution stedinger 1980 kedem and chiu 1986 cho et al 2004 ha and yoo 2007 this study also considers log normality for handling non normal rain rate data as an application example this study considers merging the radar and rain gauge data from gwanaksan radar and rain gauges within the radar umbrella gwanaksan radar is the first meteorological radar introduced in korea and covers seoul the capital city of korea 2 theory 2 1 theory of cokriging and variogram 2 1 1 cokriging cokriging is one of the kriging methods that uses a linear combination of two or more variables to predict or generate the value at an unknown point journel and huijbregts 1978 myers 1982 goovaerts 1997 the predicted value z belongs to the primary variable z and the other variable u is called the secondary variable in general the primary variable is assumed to be of high quality but the number of data is small on the other hand the secondary variable is assumed to be of rather low quality but a lot of data are available the purpose of cokriging is to generate high quality data by combining the primary and secondary variables in order to predict the value at an unknown point with cokriging both variables should be correlated with each other cokriging can be expressed by the following linear equation 1 z i 1 n λ i z i j 1 m κ j u j where z i represents the primary variable at location i u j represents the secondary variable at location j n and m are the numbers of primary and secondary variables and λ and κ are the weighted values to be determined for primary and secondary variables the main purpose of cokriging is to determine the weighted values under the condition of unbiasedness and the least sum of square errors i e error variance first the bias b z between the predicted value z and the unknown true value z can be derived as follows 2 b z e z 1 i 1 n λ i e u j 1 m κ j as the bias should be zero the following two conditions are derived 3a 1 i 1 n λ i 0 3b j 1 m κ j 0 the error variance of cokriging is also derived as follows 4 σ ck 2 σ 2 2 c o v z i 1 n λ i z i j 1 m κ j u j v a r i 1 n λ i z i j 1 m κ j u j a variety of methods can be applied to minimize the error variance under the given constraint but when the number of variables is many the lagrange parameter method is useful this method uses an auxiliary function to make the given function have the extremal value under the given constraint the auxiliary function is defined by applying the multiplier to the constraint and adding it to the given function now the two conditions of unbiasedness and the minimum error variance can be combined into one objective function as follows 5 l λ 1 λ 2 λ n κ 1 κ 2 κ m ω 1 ω 2 σ ck 2 2 ω 1 1 i 1 n λ i 2 ω 2 j 1 m κ j where l λ 1 λ 2 λ n κ 1 κ 2 κ m ω 1 ω 2 is the lagrange function and ω 1 ω 2 are the lagrange multipliers the weighted values minimizing eq 5 are the optimal solutions to be determined for cokriging these optimal solutions can be determined by differentiating eq 5 with respect to two lagrange multipliers and weighted values as a result the following set of linear equations is derived 6a i 1 n λ i c o v z l z i j 1 m κ j c o v z l u j ω 1 c o v z 0 z l l 1 n 6b i 1 n λ i c o v u l z i j 1 m κ j c o v u l u j ω 1 c o v z 0 z l l 1 m 6c i 1 n λ i 1 6d j 1 m κ j 0 the above equations can also be expressed in matrix form 7 c z x 1 x 1 c z x 1 x n c zu x 1 x 1 c zu x 1 x m 1 0 c z x n x 1 c z x n x n c zu x n x 1 c zu x n x m 1 0 c zu x 1 x 1 c zu x n x 1 c u x 1 x 1 c u x 1 x m 0 1 c zu x 1 x m c zu x n x m c u x m x 1 c u x m x m 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 λ 1 λ n κ 1 κ m ω 1 ω 2 c z x 0 x 1 c z x 0 x n c zu x 0 x 1 c zu x 0 x m 1 0 where c zu is the covariance between two variables and x i and x i are the locations of the primary and the secondary variables respectively the size of the cokriging matrix is n m 2 n m 2 and the total number of data becomes n m 2 1 2 variogram and cross variogram the variogram is a measure to represent the similarity of data at a certain distance to make a cokriging matrix equation such as eq 7 the covariance must be estimated this can be done using the variogram and cross variogram of the primary and secondary variables first an empirical variogram should be derived to determine the theoretical variogram the empirical variogram of the univariate data can be derived using the following eq 8 8 γ h 1 2 n i 1 n r x i r x i h 2 where γ h represents the variogram as a function of the separation distance h n is the number of observation points and r x i is the observed values the cross variogram derived using both the primary and secondary variables can also be determined as follows 9 γ h 1 2 n i 1 n u x i u x i h v x i v x i h where u x i and v x i are the primary and the secondary variables respectively comparison of eqs 8 and 9 shows that the variogram and the cross variogram are very similar to each other the only difference is the number of variables used thus in the case that the two variables are identical the cross variogram becomes the variogram the variogram always has a positive value but the cross variogram can be negative if the correlation of two variables is negative with the determined empirical variograms using eqs 8 and 9 the correlation length and sill height are determined the correlation length represents the maximum separation distance that guarantees the statistically significant correlation coefficient between points the sill height is the corresponding value of variance at the correlation length the theoretical variogram is then determined by applying the correlation length and sill height to the theoretical model spherical exponential and gaussian models are generally considered as the theoretical model and in this study the gaussian model is used the gaussian model is given as follows 10 γ h c 0 g a u s s a h c 0 1 exp 3 h a 2 where c 0 is the sill height and a is the correlation length the gaussian model is known to be better for the normally distributed or highly correlated data field once the gaussian model is determined the covariance can be calculated using the following equation 11 cov h σ 2 γ h where cov h represents the covariance and σ 2 the variance once the covariance is determined the cokriging matrix equation can be composed also the weighted values of the primary and the secondary variables can be determined by solving the cokriging matrix equation 2 2 correlation coefficient according to the data intermittency and log normality 2 2 1 correlation coefficient of normally distributed and intermittent data the covariance a component of the cokriging matrix equation is affected by the correlation coefficient in general the covariance has the following relation with the correlation coefficient 12 cov x y ρ σ x σ y where cov x y is the covariance between x and y ρ is the correlation coefficient and σ x and σ y represent the standard deviation of x and y respectively the correlation coefficients vary depending on the data intermittency and probability density functions of the measurements the correlation coefficient of the normally distributed and intermittent data can be confirmed through ha and yoo 2007 the data measured at two rain gauge locations according to the rainfall characteristics can be categorized as the following three conditions a x 0 a n d y 0 b x 0 o r y 0 and c x 0 a n d y 0 ρ a and ρ b on the conditions a and b can be derived as eqs 14 and 15 using eq 13 the total probability theorem parzen 1962 13 e h y e h y x x p x x 14 ρ a p 11 e x y e x p 10 e x x 0 y 0 e y p 01 e y x 0 y 0 p 11 e x 2 p 10 e x 2 x 0 y 0 e x p 10 e x x 0

measurements are not zero ρ b ρ c it is obvious that the correlation coefficient can be changed depending on the 0 values included in the data when the data follow the normal distribution 2 2 2 correlation coefficient of log normally distributed and intermittent data the correlation coefficient reviewed in section 2 2 1 may not be applicable to non normal data rain rate data are known to follow a non normal distribution and in many cases the rain rate data are well modeled by a log normal distribution kedem and chiu 1986 shimizu and sagae 1990 also investigated the statistical characteristics of the mixed bivariate log normal distribution ha and yoo 2007 also derived the correlation coefficient of the log normally distributed and intermittent data the mixed bivariate log normal distribution is defined as follows 16 δ 2 δ 0 δ 1 δ 2 μ 1 μ 2 μ 1 μ 2 σ 1 2 σ 2 2 σ 1 2 σ 2 2 ρ where δ p x 0 y 0 and 0 δ 1 eq 16 can also be expressed as follows using the bivariate log normal joint distribution function h such as the univariate log normal distribution function f or g 17 f x λ 1 x μ 1 σ 1 2 x 0 g x λ 1 y μ 2 σ 2 2 y 0 h x y λ 2 x y μ 1 μ 2 σ 1 2 σ 2 2 ρ x 0 y 0 where λ 1 μ σ 2 represents the log normal distribution with mean μ and variance σ 2 and λ 2 μ 1 μ 2 σ 1 2 σ 2 2 ρ represents the bivariate log normal distribution with means μ 1 and μ 2 variances σ 1 2 and σ 2 2 and correlation coefficient ρ the moments under the condition a x 0 a n d y 0 when x or y follows the log normal distribution can be derived as follows 18 e x a exp μ 1 σ 1 2 2 e x 2 a exp 2 μ 1 2 σ 1 2 e y a exp μ 2 σ 2 2 2 e y 2 a exp 2 μ 2 2 σ 2 2 also the expectation of xy under the condition a in the joint distribution of x y given by the bivariate log normal distribution is expressed as follows 19 e x y a exp μ 1 μ 2 σ 1 2 2 σ 1 σ 2 ρ σ 2 2 2 using eqs 18 and 19 the correlation coefficient ρ a is derived as eq 20 by the definition of the correlation coefficient of eq 12 20 ρ a exp ρ σ 1 σ 2 1 exp σ 1 2 1 1 2 exp σ 2 2 1 1 2 ρ b and ρ c can also be derived in the same way as in section 2 2 1 if the conditions e x k x 0 y 0 and e y k x 0 y 0 are given the above results show that the correlation coefficient is dependent upon both the data distribution function and zero measurements this will affect the covariance the shape of the variogram and finally the results of the cokriging 3 application examples 3 1 data this study used the gwanaksan radar data and rain gauge data within the radar umbrella to evaluate the effect of data intermittency and log normality on the cokriging as the first weather radar in korea gwanaksan weather radar is located in the southern part of seoul korea at latitude 37 26 28 longitude 126 57 58 and elevation 637 m the gwanaksan radar is an s band radar whose observation range is 240 km it has a maximum resolution of 500 m 500 m but in this study the 4 km 4 km data were applied to the cokriging this is to prevent the cokriging result being severely smoothed or overestimated when the number of grids is too large goovaerts 2000 the marshall and palmer 1948 relationship was used to convert the radar reflectivity data to the radar rain rate the radar rain rate was also corrected by the g r ratio to increase the efficiency of the merging rain rate data measured every 10 min at each rain gauge station were applied to the cokriging a total of 337 rain gauges are located within the umbrella of gwanaksan radar but only 83 rain gauges were used for the merging of the rain rate field this is to prevent the overestimation of rain rate and too large rainfall spatial coverage when the rain gauge network is dense the remaining rain gauges were used to evaluate the merged rain rate field fig 1 shows the location of gwanaksan radar site and rain gauges within the radar umbrella as can be seen in this figure it is assumed that the rain gauges are evenly distributed over the radar umbrella a total of four rainfall events were considered in this study which were those observed on september 11 2010 july 28 2011 july 19 2012 and september 17 2012 the monthly weather review of the korea meteorological administration kma 2010 explains that the rainfall event during the period of september 11 to 12 2010 was due to a low pressure system located at the southern part of the korean peninsula the rainfall event during the period of july 26 to 28 2011 was due to an unstable atmospheric condition kma 2010 kma 2011b the rainfall event during the period of july 18 to 19 2012 was due to typhoon khanun and the rainfall event observed on september 17 2012 was due to typhoon sanba kma 2012 in this study as examples only five rain rate fields were selected for further application these were those observed at 4 30 september 11 2010 event 1 at 8 30 september 11 2010 event 2 at 9 00 july 28 2011 event 3 at 5 00 july 19 2012 event 4 and at 12 20 september 17 2012 event 5 fig 2 shows the radar images and gauge rain rate fields for these five rain rate fields fig 2 in particular shows a somewhat circular pattern to the rain gauge rate fields around the rain gauge station this is because the anisotropy was not considered in the generation of the rain gauge rain rate field in this study a radar rain rate of less than 0 5 mm hr was assumed to be no rain this was to consider the minimum detectable rain rate of the rain gauges within the radar umbrella the ratios of no rain in these rain rate fields are 76 5 for event 1 79 5 for event 2 92 3 for event 3 76 4 for event 4 and 68 3 for event 5 these rain rate data were assumed to follow a log normal distribution thus in the cokriging both the original data and the natural log transformed data were considered for comparison the zero measurements were set to be unchanged when considering the data log normality table 1 shows the means variances and maximum values of gauge and radar rain rate data considered in this study table 1 shows that the means of radar rain rate are similar to those of the rain gauge rain rate which is actually the result of the g r correction on the other hand the variance of the rain gauge rain rate was found to be much higher than those of the radar rain rate this can also be confirmed in the comparison of the rain gauge and radar rain rate fields see fig 2 where the radar rain rate field is more smooth and continuous which means its variance is smaller than that of the rain gauge rain rate field after taking logarithms of the original data as the log transformed data smoothens the data field the basic statistics like the mean variance and maximum value are found to become very similar to each other 3 2 determination of variograms cokriging requires the variogram for the primary variable the variogram for the secondary one and the cross variogram for both the primary and secondary variables in this study the rain gauge rain rate was considered as the primary variable and the radar rain rate the secondary one when deriving the variogram for the primary variable the point rain gauge rain rate data were used but when deriving the cross variogram the rain gauge data were first spatially distributed to match the data structure for the radar data a total of four different cases of variograms were derived in this study the first case case 1 was those without consideration for both the rainfall intermittency and log normality the second case case 2 with consideration for only the rainfall intermittency the third case case 3 with consideration for only the rainfall log normality and the last case case 4 with consideration for both the rainfall intermittency and log normality fig 3 compares variograms derived for the rain gauge and radar data and the cross variogram for event 1 also figs 4 7 are the same but for events 2 5 respectively in these figures the dotted line represents the empirical variogram while the solid line represents the theoretical variogram derived by applying the gaussian model among the variograms in these figures those for the rain gauge data were found to be rather wiggly mainly due to the limited number of data available on the other hand the variograms for the radar data were all found to be rather smooth and the cross variograms were in between the two the sill heights for the cross variograms were also estimated to be in between those for the radar data and the rain gauge data quite interestingly the correlation lengths of the cross variogram were estimated to be much longer than those for the radar and rain gauge data in fact this result is natural as the cross variogram can consider the storm movement over time comparison of the four cases of variograms also shows some interesting differences first in the cases considering the data characteristics the gaussian model fits better this result was the same even for the case of considering only the data intermittency which is more distinct for the rain gauge data the relative roles of data intermittency and log normality when deriving the variogram were found to be different depending on the rainfall event the effect of rainfall intermittency seems more distinct in the variograms of the radar data but the effect of data log normality seems more or less the same in both the radar and rain gauge data the sill heights when considering both the data intermittency and log normality seem to be similar to those that just consider the data log normality table 2 summarizes the correlation lengths for all three rainfall events along with the sill heights table 2 shows that the sill heights of case 1 were found to be higher than those for the other cases which is the same for all the rainfall events also the sill heights of the rain gauge data were estimated to be much higher than those for the radar data which seems to be the result reflecting the difference between the point value and areal average value the sill heights of the cross variograms were all determined to have values in between those for the radar and rain gauge data the correlation length was found to be longer in the cases with consideration for the data characteristics in particular for the rain gauge data the correlation length was longer in the cases of considering the data log normality than that of considering the data intermittency but the exactly opposite result was derived for the radar data due to the difference of point data and areal average data the relative effect of rainfall intermittency and log normality seems to become opposite however the longest correlation length was derived when considering both the data intermittency and log normality that is both considerations of data intermittency and log normality increase the correlation length the above findings show that consideration of the data characteristics can significantly change the shape of the variogram in this application with the radar and rain gauge rain rate in both cases of considering the data intermittency and log normality the correlation length was increased on the other hand when considering the data characteristics the sill height of the variogram was decreased however when considering both the data intermittency and log normality the sill heights were found to be a bit higher than those when considering only the data log normality 3 3 results and discussions in this part of the study the radar rain rate and rain gauge rain rate were merged by applying the cokriging technique considering the variograms derived in the previous section such as in figs 3 7 in particular when considering cases 3 and 4 the logarithmic data were first merged and then the antilogarithmic field was derived also the merged rain rate of less than 0 5 mm hr was considered as no rain to consider the minimum detectable rain rate of those rain gauges considered in this study fig 8 compares the cokriging results of four cases with respect to each rain rate field considered in this study from left the case without considering any data characteristics case 1 the case considering only the data intermittency case 2 the case considering only the data log normality case 3 and the case considering both the data intermittency and log normality case 4 in fact all of the merged rain rate fields seem to be more or less similar to the original radar rain rate field however somewhat specific differences could also be found such as the correction of the beam blocked area and the filling of the missing points also more markedly the rainfall coverage could be compared and as a result it was maximized when considering both the rainfall intermittency and log normality more detailed examination of fig 8 shows that the spatial distribution of the merged rain rate field without considering any of the data characteristics was most similar to the original radar rain rate field this is simply because the characteristics of the ground data were not properly considered in the merging due to this reason the rainfall coverage remained smaller than other cases that considered the data characteristics the area of high rain rate was also found smaller than for the other cases basically consideration of data characteristics increased the correlation length which also increased the rainfall coverage as well as the area of high rain rate when considering the data intermittency even though the spatial distribution of the merged data field was found similar to that without considering any of the data characteristics the area of high rain rate was significantly increased in particular for events 3 4 and 5 it is easy to detect the increased area of high rain rate colored by red this is mainly because considering the data intermittency increased the correlation length of the merged rain rate field the effect of data intermittency also varied depending on the rain rate field and event 5 with many scattered rain rate areas showed somewhat unsmooth results of merging the change was also found obvious when considering the data log normality in particular the effect of the ground rain rate data in the merged rain rate field could be detected very easily as a result the area of rain became larger than those for the previous two cases in particular the beam blocking area of the radar rain rate was significantly implemented by the rain gauge data even though the rain rate itself in this area was not as high as that of the rain gauge data similar to the case of considering the data intermittency considering the data log normality also increased the area of high rain rate the case of considering both the data intermittency and log normality showed a similar result to that of considering the data log normality only however in this case the area of high rain rate was found larger than for the other cases also the rain rate of the beam blocking area became much higher than that in the case of considering the data log normality only overall the effect of merging was found most distinctly in this case of considering both the data intermittency and log normality in fact this was a natural result of the longer correlation length which had been derived as a result of considering the data characteristics that is by properly considering the data characteristics it is possible to improve the quality of merging and to produce a more realistic data field table 3 summarizes the results in fig 8 by rmse and bs when estimating the rmse of the merged data field only the ground data which had not been used for merging were used the bs considers only the bias of the merged data but the rmse considers both the bias and randomness using these two statistics the quality of the merged field can easily be evaluated table 3 additionally provides the mean and maximum values of the merged data field for reference first table 3 shows that the mean of the merged rain rate field without considering the data characteristics was found to be smaller by 14 19 than the ground data this was mainly because of the short correlation length on the other hand when considering the data intermittency or data log normality the mean of the merged rain rate field became more or less the same as that of the ground data when considering both the data intermittency and log normality even though there is a case where the mean of the merged field was higher than the ground data by about 15 case 4 of event 1 the mean of the merged rain rate field was found to be very close to the ground data the maximum value of the merged data field was found to be smaller than that of the ground data in all cases considered in this study in some cases the maximum value of the merged data field was found to be similar to the ground data event 2 but in some other cases events 1 5 the maximum value was far smaller than the ground data cokriging seems to over smooth the data field even though the log normality was considered as the rmse is estimated by considering both the bias and variability of the merged data the difference of mean and variance of the merged data from those of the ground data can also be expected with the rmse for example the rmses of the merged data without considering any of the data characteristics were found to be mostly larger than those with considering the data characteristics as an example for event 1 the rmse of the merged data without considering any data characteristics was estimated to be 3 123 but was 3 019 decrease by 3 3 when considering the data intermittency 2 921 decrease by 6 5 when considering the data log normality and 2 860 decrease by 8 42 when considering both the data intermittency and log normality for events 2 and 4 the maximum rmse decrease was by about 10 when considering both the data intermittency and log normality it is also noticeable that the effect of considering the data log normality on the rmse was higher than that of considering the data intermittency in some cases like event 3 somewhat disappointing results could be found that is the rmse of the merged data without considering the data characteristics was found to be smaller than those of considering the data intermittency and or data log normality this result was mainly due to the small rainfall coverage which resulted in rather large difference between the merged data and the ground field consideration of data characteristics especially the data log normality was found to quite significantly enlarge the rainfall coverage which could lead to a higher rmse as the rainfall coverage was originally small the above results indicate that the cokriging result is mostly better in the case of considering the data characteristics in particular the consideration of the data log normality was found to have higher impact on the cokriging result than the data intermittency this result is especially meaningful as the rain rate data do not strictly follow a log normal distribution once the proper distribution function for the rain rate data could be applied a better one step result might be derived 4 summary and conclusions this study evaluated the effects of data intermittency and log normality on the merging of the rain rate field the cokriging was used as a tool for merging and as an example the radar and rain gauge rain rate data from gwanaksan radar and rain gauges within the radar umbrella were merged and evaluated in this study the variogram which is a decisive component in the application of the cokriging was also derived separately by considering one or both of the data intermittency and data log normality to evaluate the change of its shape the derived variograms were then applied to the merging of radar and rain gauge data and finally the merged rain rate fields were compared with the ground data the results can be summarized as follows first in the cases of considering the data characteristics the gaussian model was found to fit better for the empirical variograms when considering the data intermittency and non normality the correlation length was found to be longer on the other hand when considering the data characteristics the sill height of the variogram was found to be decreased second when considering the data characteristics the rainfall coverage of the merged rain rate field generated by applying the cokriging was found to be larger the case of considering both the data intermittency and non normality resulted in the effect of merging being found most distinctly in fact this is a reasonable result as considering the data characteristics lengthened the correlation length finally it was found that by considering both the data intermittency and log normality the merged rain rate field generated was most similar to the ground rain rate field the comparison of bss and rmses also confirmed this result when considering the data characteristics the mean of the merged rain rate field became more or less the same as that of the ground data the rmses of the merged data with considering any of the data characteristics were also found to be smaller than for those not in particular the consideration of the data log normality was found to have higher impact on the cokriging result than the data intermittency the results in this study show that consideration of the data intermittency and log normality could improve the quality of the merged rain rate field however there remains a hidden problem that the rain rate data may not fully follow a log normal distribution in the merging of radar and rain gauge rain rate data data anisotropy is also another serious problem that should be considered properly considering all of these characteristics of the rain rate data in the merging could be expected to further improve the quality of the rain rate field declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships
