1535,even though attenuation processes in the subsurface are known to reduce the impacts of contaminant plumes their importance is significantly dependent on geological and climatic characteristics as well as on the leachate quality the knowledge of attenuation processes linked to different geological formations is therefore fundamental in predicting the impacts of waste disposal areas geophysical methods are useful tools for assessing and delineating contaminant plumes as well as their changes with time which enables their lower cost monitoring and association with geological and environmental properties this paper shows the results of geophysical surveys conducted in the years of 1996 2005 and 2018 in a waste disposal area located at a guarani aquifer recharge zone in brazil the objective of this study was to show the evolution of the contamination plume as well as discuss some possible transport and attenuation processes that the contaminants may undergo in similar areas five geophysical sections surveyed within a time span of 20 years were compared and the information was integrated with physicochemical data from monitoring wells the results show a horizontal plume spreading reaching about 200 m from the deposit and about 60 m of depth 20 years after the ending of disposal activities the measured resistivities in 2018 are similar to the ones found in 1996 and 2005 in the same surveyed areas showing that a significant temporal attenuation did not occur moreover samples collected close to anomaly zones and within a distance of 200 m from the deposit presented concentrations of some heavy metals above the screening values according to the brazilian legislation showing a metals mobility higher than previously expected which can be possibly explained by the aquifer s acidic conditions the estimated plume velocity was about 7 m yr a plume deepening was observed until about 50 m and changes in water flow direction and or diffusion processes made the plume spread to areas previously regarded as upgradient therefore the present paper shows that the rehabilitation of sites neighboring waste disposal sites less than 200 m from it did not seem to be feasible through natural attenuation in sandy soils and that the plume spreading is significant in this geological formation thus abandoned disposal areas constantly considered to be closed after the ending of disposal activities in developing countries generate plumes which move silently and may reach areas of concern in the future keywords waste deposits groundwater contamination geophysical surveys long term monitoring guarani aquifer 1 introduction waste deposits are significant sources of groundwater pollution since they generate highly contaminated leachates that percolate through the subsoil reaching the aquifers and altering them for decades or centuries after the ending of the disposal activities independently of the deposit size fetter et al 2018 the greatest difficulty in managing these areas mainly when not properly planned is related to the variability of the landfilled content from domestic residues to mineral industrial construction and demolition debris and even hazardous substances the random distribution of materials leads to the generation of plumes with different compositions which are also altered with time and depending on the local climatic conditions bjerg et al 2013 moreover the transport direction of these plumes may vary about 70 degrees adding complexity to their delineation and requiring the combination of different surveying methods and the adoption of a dense sampling grid for an adequate mapping christensen et al 2000 the geophysical methods are useful tools for complementing the physicochemical evaluation which sometimes cannot represent the plume variability and spreading especially when a comprehensive grid of monitoring wells is not available mao et al 2015 from them the geoelectrical methods have been extensively used as they provide visible contrasts between contaminated and non contaminated areas in terms of resistivity boudreault et al 2010 gasperikova et al 2012 bichet et al 2016 caterina et al 2017 maurya et al 2017 soupios and ntarlagiannis 2017 baawain et al 2018 simyrdanis et al 2018 which enables their application to studies involving the waste distribution in landfills audebert et al 2014 audebert et al 2016a audebert et al 2016b dumont et al 2016 de donno and cardarelli 2017 and the contaminant plumes temporal evolution surrounding landfills acworth and jorstad 2006 al tarazi et al 2008 lopes et al 2012 and uncontrolled landfills park et al 2016 di maio et al 2018 høyer et al 2019 it is important to highlight that monitoring waste deposits in different geological formations and climatic conditions is still of utmost importance since few contaminant plumes stemming from them have been entirely documented from the few existing studies which thoroughly document contaminant plumes originated from waste deposits it has been shown that transport and attenuation processes can promote a natural remediation of the contaminant plume limiting the environmental impacts to an area that does not generally exceed 1000 m from the deposit but can possibly reach more than 3000 m christensen et al 2000 the natural attenuation consists of the combination of several natural processes including dilution dispersion volatilization precipitation ion exchange sorption transformation and degradation which promote a reduction in the contaminants concentrations the intensity of the attenuation processes varies in function of the environmental conditions including the characteristics of the geological formation such as its granulometry and cation exchange capacity and the availability of electron acceptors christensen et al 2001 roling and van verseveld 2002 bjerg et al 2013 consequently the knowledge of the environmental characteristics associated with the plumes extents and their impacts can contribute to the adoption of management actions suitable for different contexts and conditions and consequently to a reduction of the number of areas that effectively need to be remediated therefore it is mandatory to provide the proper monitoring of contaminant plumes from different waste deposits geological formations and climatic conditions so that the contaminants behavior can be predicted and appropriate management actions can be adopted this paper shows the results of a comparative assessment of geophysical surveys conducted in the years of 1996 2005 and 2018 in an unplanned waste disposal area considered to be highly vulnerable to contamination the objective of the present research was to assess the evolution of the studied contaminant plume discuss the transport and attenuation processes that contaminants may undergo in similar areas and consequently estimate the risks these sites may pose to the environment in the long term 2 methodology 2 1 study area the studied waste deposit is located in são carlos city in the southeast region of brazil in a guarani aquifer recharge zone constituted by botucatu formation sandstones são carlos climatic conditions are classified as cfa by köppen geiger its average annual precipitation is about 1440 mm and its average temperature is 19 7 c the soils in the area can be classified in oxisols red yellow latosol and quartz sands based on the average hydraulic conductivity from 10 4 to 10 6 cm s on granulometric analysis fine to medium sands and on cation exchange capacity evaluation from 0 4 to 4 6 meq 100 g it is possible to affirm that the region where the deposit is located has medium to high vulnerability to contamination gonçalves 1986 freitas 1996 velozo 2006 a previous detailed investigation performed by pmsc 2011 showed that the geological formation in the area is consisted fundamentally of sandy soils see figures 1sm and 2sm of the supplementary material this information supported the interpretation of the geophysical sections making it possible to affirm that the variations in the resistivity values were essentially associated with the contamination plume and not with geological heterogeneities the waste disposal occurred in the mentioned region from 1980 to 1996 with the destination of domestic industrial construction and demolition and health service wastes in an old gully without any study of suitability or adoption of structures for groundwater and public health protection about 440 000m3 of solid waste covering an area of around 48 400m2 were disposed of in the area velozo 2006 moreover the location of the water table inside the waste massif is an aggravating factor to groundwater contamination considering these features the site has been included in the list of contaminated areas of the state of são paulo according to its state environmental agency cetesb 2017 additionally it is important to emphasize that the site is strategically important due to the high percentages of groundwater use for public water supply in the cities in the region achieving 50 in são carlos city and 100 in ribeirão preto a neighbor city because of its location importance and high groundwater contamination potential several studies have been conducted in the area rios 1993 bossolan 1993 menezes 1995 freitas 1996 gadotti 1997 matsuzaki 1998 álvares 2000 velozo 2006 pmsc 2011 shinzato 2014 pelinson 2018 from the studies there is a consensus in terms of the existence of high pollutants charges generated by the waste deposit associated with a relatively small influence area additionally some authors supposed that there are high attenuation and depuration capacities by the geological formation and the surface waters menezes 1995 freitas 1996 gadotti 1997 even though no estimation of the extent of the environmental impacts has been done therefore the previous studies showed that there are still high pollutants charges in the waste deposit but that the attenuation and transport processes in the surrounding geological formation are not totally understood consequently no intervention measure has been adopted and even though the area is considered to be vulnerable to contamination the studies have not shown significant impacts on the surroundings 2 2 historical data collection a historical data collection was performed in order to compare them and assess the evolution of the plume delineation with time the results obtained by gadotti 1997 and velozo 2006 were selected since they performed geophysical surveys and water samplings in the region in 1996 and 2005 respectively during the same hydrological season assessed in the present study dry season from june to august elis et al 2016 were also considered in view of the geophysical interpretation and the physicochemical analysis of samples collected in 2005 2 3 geophysical surveys geophysical data acquisition was carried out in august 2018 using a dipole dipole array and a syscal electrical resistivity meter similarly to the previous studies the data quality analysis was performed during their acquisition each measurement was made with the stacking minimum of 10 and the average and standard deviation values were calculated whenever the calculated standard deviation was greater than 3 the equipment continued to the maximum stacking of 20 for better results in case of noisy data a checking of the contacts between wires and electrodes was performed and repeated readings were conducted in order to guarantee the quality of the data within the standards beforementioned therefore no reading point was discarded and all had a standard deviation below 3 this protocol was stablished in order to maintain the pattern of acquisition of data from 1995 and 2005 when the acquisition system with intelligent electrodes was not available we consider that this acquisition methodology can be more effective in areas impacted by waste deposits than the discard of noisy data which is commonly conducted in multielectrode acquisitions the data collected in 2018 as well as in 1995 and 2005 were interpreted with res2dinv 3 4 geotomo software 2007 using the least square method and robust inversion five sections of about 700 m of extent located transversely to the waste deposit were surveyed and dipoles of 40 m were adopted the selected dipoles aimed at providing a more in depth investigation analysis propitiating an adequate mapping of the plume which could not be done formerly since the previous studies were conducted with dipoles of 10 m in sections of about 150 m of extent therefore the previous studies 1996 and 2005 provided a better detailing of the subsurface but also a restricted delineation of the plume some sections surveyed in 2018 coincided with others conducted in 1995 and 2005 and could thus be compared the different lines surveyed in the distinct years are shown in fig 1 since it was not clear if anomalies present in previous years were still existent in 2018 due to the different adopted dipoles and consequent precision of the results an extra line with dipoles of 2 5 m was surveyed above line 32 018 see fig 1 lines 2018 enabling the observation and comparison of anomaly intensities with time 2 4 sample collection groundwater samples were collected from existing monitoring wells in order to support the geophysical data analysis the samples were collected from wells p23 in line 1 p12 p2 and p3 in line 2 p13a p14 and leachate monitoring station lms in line 3 and p16 p17 p18 and p9 in line 4 line 5 did not present any monitoring well but crossed a small stream from which samples were also collected in locations upstream and downstream to the deposit sampling points up and dw2 respectively the localization of each sampling point is presented in fig 1 as well as along with the geophysical sections in figs 4 9 the sampling was performed in august 2018 and ph ec electrical conductivity cod chemical oxygen demand chloride and potentially toxic metals were analyzed following the procedures described by the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2012 it is important to highlight that the beforementioned procedure was conducted in 2018 for the years of 1996 and 2005 as described in item 2 2 physicochemical data was collected from gadotti 1997 and elis et al 2016 note that only ph ec cod and chloride were assesed in 1996 for wells p12 and p18 whereas only ec and chloride were analyzed in 2005 for surface water sampling points up and dw1 3 results and discussion 3 1 evolution of the quality of water resources figs 2 and 3 show the distribution of ec and ph values for the years 1996 2005 and 2018 all the physicochemical data as well as maps showing chemical oxygen demand cod and chloride concentrations are shown in the supplementary material table 1sm figures 3sm and 4sm respectively data concerning potentially toxic metals are presented whenever their levels exceeded the screening values along with the geophysical profiles item 3 2 it is important to note that the majority of the monitoring wells did not exist in 1995 nor in 2005 so that a more comprehensive scenario of the water resources contamination can only be observed in 2018 even so for the wells existent both in 1995 and 2018 it can be noted that p12 underwent a deterioration in water quality whereas p18 suffered a mild improvement this observation shows that the plume seems to have moved but did not attenuate over time additionally it is possible to note that the highest anomalies are present inside the waste deposit with decrease of ec values with distance from it even so the impact of the waste deposit in the surroundings is evident see p2 and p3 even not taking into consideration the appropriate location of monitoring wells and their filters 3 2 evolution of the geophysical profiles in this section the geophysical profiles located in close geographical coordinates are presented together in order to better compare the evolution of the plume the water level is presented whenever measured and only in areas where interpolation was possible monitoring wells are also depicted in the corresponding geographical location some topographical data variations could be noted in the different years possibly due to their obtention from different surveys and methods topographical maps in 1996 and 2005 and radar data acquisition in 2018 since the region s pedological sections see figures 1sm and 2sm of the supplementary material show the area as being fundamentally formed by sandy soils without geological heterogeneities the anomalies found in the geophysical sections were attributed to the waste deposit s influence fig 4 shows the resistivity models for line 1 of the 1996 survey and line 1 of the 2018 survey the water table is not shown since the existing monitoring well p23 was dry from the comparison of the resistivity models in fig 4 it is possible to note that the smaller dipole adopted in 1996 led to a higher subsurface detailing showing anomalies that may exist but are not visible for larger dipoles nonetheless it seems that the plume moved downwards achieving about 40 50 m of depth 20 years after the deposit s closure unfortunately the existing monitoring well was dry in both studied years 1996 and 2018 so that it was not possible to evaluate the level of contamination even so samples collected in 2017 during the same hydrological season showed very low electrical conductivity 40 μs cm see fig 2 the analysis does not exclude the possibility of contamination in the region since the well does not present the largest resistivity anomalies the most important conclusion from this first comparison is that there is evidence of contamination in an area considered to be upgradient the waste deposit based on its superficial limiting fig 1 and on p23 well profile sandy soils according to freitas 1996 additionally the plume seems to have moved downwards and possibly to the w but do not exceed 50 m of depth and about 200 m of extension the first consideration shows that either the establishment of the waste boundaries may not have appropriately respected the actual waste disposal or the diffusion may have played an important role on contaminants spreading in the area making contaminants reach upgradient regions it is important to highlight that the unplanned and uncontrolled disposal of residues in such areas may have possibly led to the existence of waste in unexpected areas i e outside the gully and on its surroundings fig 5 shows the comparison of line 2 of the 1996 survey and line 2 of the 2018 survey it is important to emphasize that the superficial extent of the line surveyed in 1996 corresponds to the boundaries of the waste deposit and that the waste deposit s depth is approximately 15 m velozo 2006 similarly to the previous comparison it is not possible to affirm that the anomalies of lowest resistivity do not exist in 2018 since they are restricted to about 5 to 10 m and may not be represented in surveys using larger dipoles nonetheless the order of magnitude of the anomalies of low resistivity is similar from about 5 10 ω m in 1996 to about 25 ω m in 2018 which does not show evidence of significant attenuation of contaminants 20 years after the deposit s closure on the other hand the spreading is evident in 1996 the plume seems to have been restricted to the gully s structure not achieving depths much larger than 20 m whereas in 2018 it reached about 80 m from the deposit and 60 m of depth once again the monitoring wells do not reach the areas of maximum anomalies which prevents the secure characterization of the contaminant plume even so as it can be observed from fig 2 a water quality deterioration occurred in the region of p12 which is compatible with the resistivity values from the geophysical model nonetheless this behavior was not expected since the well is supposedly situated upgradient the deposit see figure 5sm of the supplementary material and no waste was found during the drilling freitas 1996 which is compatible with the 1996 resistivity model thus the movement of the contaminant plume may be attributed to hydraulic conductivity anomalies common in waste deposit areas which according to christensen et al 2000 may lead to changes in the direction of the plume flux of until 70 degrees another mechanism that has possibly contributed to the observed plume behavior is the diffusion which may be significant in the studied area both mentioned processes summed to the irregular waste disposal show the importance of adequately monitoring all the surroundings of waste deposits wells p2 and p3 could only be sampled in 2018 since they did not exist in 1996 the values of ec fig 2 confirm the impacts of the deposit at this distance 80 m even the mentioned wells not properly reaching the areas of greatest anomalies moreover the evaluation of potentially toxic metals in the collected samples showed values of lead concentration of 20 μg l for p2 and of 70 μg l for p3 these values are higher than the brazilian screening value for this metal which is equal to 10 μg l cetesb 2016 p2 also presented concentration of cobalt almost twice as high 125 μg l as the screening value for this metal 70 μg l a previous technical study pmsc 2011 also showed high values of arsenic barium and selenium in p2 which were not detected in 2018 this situation is worrisome considering that wells which did not seem to present significant water quality deterioration in terms of the most commonly adopted parameters for waste disposal areas electrical conductivity chloride and organic matter may have high concentrations of potentially toxic metals moreover based on the resistivity model higher concentrations are expected at about 50 m deep it is important to emphasize that even though no background well could be found in the studied area since the previously considered upgradient well p23 was proven not to be the groundwater from the guarani aquifer is not expected to carry significant concentrations of these metals cetesb 2016 regarding the transport of heavy metals in groundwater it is a consensus that these substances have restricted mobility in these environments especially in neutral to basic conditions hem 1985 qasim and chiang 1994 fetter et al 2018 christensen et al 2001 thus two factors may have contributed to the existence of some high values in the surrounding area a the mixture of industrial waste in the studied dumpsite which can possibly have higher concentrations of these pollutants b the higher mobility of metals in acidic conditions ph 5 0 which are commonly found in the free and shallow areas of the guarani aquifer cetesb 2016 thus several recharge zones can propitiate a higher mobility of heavy metals being even more vulnerable from this point of view for the example of lead it has been reported that its sorption by soil is diminished when ph is below 4 61 fetter et al 2018 or below 5 0 qasim and chiang 1994 it is also important to note from fig 5 that the contaminants plume was not restricted to the gully s structure as expected by elis et al 2016 it moved downwards until about 40 m deep in the region of the waste massif and then started moving to the w and also in depth reaching about 60 m this behavior is attributed to the advection the most significant transport process below the water table whose main direction in the region is w or nw see figure 5sm of the supplementary material similarly to the previous resistivity sections the models depicted in fig 6 shows a plume spreading to the w achieving about 100 m far from the deposit and 30 m deep this movement tendency was detected in 2005 around the electrode situated in position 200 m at approximately 15 m deep however the plume extension could not be detected before 2018 the most significant anomalies for both models are situated inside the waste body and do not seem to have attenuated with time presenting values of about 5 10 ω m in the corresponding surveyed areas chemical analysis of the groundwater inside the massif could be performed in 2018 but not in 2005 as the monitoring wells did not exist before 2014 shinzato 2014 the physicochemical analysis fig 2 and figures 3sm and 4sm of the supplementary material evidences that there are high concentrations of pollutants inside the waste body especially in lms which is approximately 7 m deep and is entirely inside the massif the results of well p14 show the groundwater quality just bellow the massif since this monitoring well is about 20 m deep and its filter is situated approximately 4 m below the massif comparing the results of lms and p14 it is possible to observe that a mild decrease in pollutants concentrations occurred in the aquifer additionally the analysis of the geophysical profile permitted to observe a mild plume spreading to the ne similarly to fig 5 which has been attributed to flux anomalies and or diffusion in order to compare the intensity of the anomalies in 2018 with the ones found in 2005 a survey with dipoles of 2 5 m was conducted in the same position of line 3 2018 but within the waste deposit boundaries with about 110 m of extension the resulting resistivity model is presented in fig 7 with this analysis it was possible to note that there are still very low resistivity values inside the massif compatible with the ones found in previous years showing no attenuation evidence the residues are present until about 10 12 m and the disposal seems to accompany the gully s structure in the center of the gully a more intense downward leachate flow can be observed probably associated with the existence of a more important mass of waste additionally it is possible to notice that with smaller dipoles there is the impression that the plume is restricted to the gully s structure which was proven not to be true therefore it is important to advise that in similar studies larger dipoles are also adopted at least in one surveyed section so that the appropriate mapping of the plume is done likewise the previously analyzed sections fig 8 depicts the plume spreading to the w evident in 2018 but also noticed in 2005 position 100 m low resistivity values 25 ω m were still found in 2018 not only in the waste massif but also about 150 m far from the deposit and 40 m deep showing that spreading was not accompanied by contaminants attenuation the monitoring wells p16 p17 and p18 are situated in areas without waste deposition freitas 1996 pmsc 2011 but with a visible spreading of the contaminant plume once again the wells do not reach the zones with the most significant resistivity anomalies which makes assumptions concerning contamination levels in the zone less precise comparing the physicochemical parameters for the different studied years see fig 2 and the supplementary material it is possible to note that within a period of about 20 years no significant quality change occurred in the surroundings of p18 and if it happened the tendency was of degradation or transport of organic matter cod and generation of more soluble ionic components electrical conductivity it is interesting to note that the electrical conductivity in the region of p18 slightly increased with time which does not accompany the resistivity model where the conductivity values seem to have decreased in the region this contradiction can be possibly associated with the larger dipoles adopted so that the results can be considered an average of a more significant area regarding p9 p16 and p17 samples could be collected only in 2018 see figs 2 and 3 similarly to the behavior observed for line 2 2018 results above the screening values for lead were detected in p9 80 μg l which did not present significant physicochemical or resistivity anomalies this as before mentioned can be considered alarming since these substances could be found in areas without visible anomalies in the resistivity values nor in other physicochemical parameters it is important to highlight that lead concentrations above the screening value were also previously found in p9 pmsc 2011 finally the last compared resistivity sections fig 9 did not precisely correspond to the same spatial localization as it can be seen in fig 1 line 5 2018 and line 4 2005 nevertheless since they are both located in a region downstream to the deposit it is interesting to evaluate them in order to estimate the plume extension samples collected from the stream situated in the surroundings of electrode on position 1480 m of line 5 2018 sampling point dw2 figs 1 and 2 presented very low electrical conductivity in 2018 which is compatible with background ones up figs 1 and 2 therefore the anomalies found in line 5 2018 do not represent significant quality deterioration so that it is possible to affirm that the plume does not reach this distance about 500 m downstream the deposit in terms of surface water despite this a lower resistivity anomaly is visible at about 100 m deep between electrodes on positions 800 and 880 m it is not possible to securely affirm that this anomaly is originated from the waste deposit since there is no monitoring well at this position even so the tendency of the plume s deepening and transport to the w was detected in the other resistivity sections figs 5 6 and 8 making it feasible to consider that these areas are influenced by the waste deposit a similar behavior was detected in line 4 2005 with anomalies close to the surface corresponding to the existing stream and also in depth at about 15 m both compared lines show anomalies in the sw direction which is compatible with the previously found plume movement and thus strengthens the possibility of the anomalies being associated with contamination the analysis of the electrical conductivity values for sampling points up and dw1 in 2005 shows clear influence of the waste in the surface water although geophysical sections were not performed in an identical geographical position in 2018 samples could be collected in the same points previously analyzed in 2005 presenting electrical conductivity and chloride concentrations of 852 μs cm and 42 mg l in dw1 whereas in the upstream position up the values were 54 μs cm and 1 mg l respectively the results show that about 200 m downstream the waste deposit its impacts on surface water are still significant not having considerably changed 20 years after the ending of disposal activities a mild attenuation though seems to have occurred with a possible reduction of about 20 30 in the measured parameters values comparing line 4 2005 with line 5 2018 it is possible to affirm that spatial contaminants attenuation was more significant than the temporal one moreover from all the other sections analysis it is clear that the contaminants plume is not restricted to the gully s structure having spread downgradient as expected to the w but also in depth the in depth observed movement can be associated with this area being a recharge zone with expected downwards flow it is still fundamental to evaluate the water quality in the anomalies existent downstream the deposit so that a comprehensive characterization is performed in terms of the presence of potentially toxic metals in the surface water alongside the surveyed geophysical lines no anomaly was found neither 200 m nor 500 m from the deposit this indicates that the leachate does not only travel within the gully s structure as it was previously believed elis et al 2016 but also moves in the w direction additionally potentially toxic metals are less mobile in oxidant and neutral environments making them reach closer distances when compared to the groundwater species thus in this study higher concentrations of potentially toxic elements were found in the monitoring wells than in the surface water the present study permitted to conclude that even though the transport mechanisms in the evaluated waste disposal area could lead the contaminants to reach unexpected zones they generated plumes with dimensions restricted to 200 m of extension and 50 m of depth after about 30 years of the beginning of disposal activities this agrees with other studies conducted in sandy soils maurya et al 2017 bichet et al 2016 christensen et al 2000 bjerg et al 2013 lyngkilde and christensen 1992 baedecker and apgar 1984 macfarlane et al 1983 even considering that in the studied case the residues are below the water table nevertheless it is necessary to question if this plume delineation is indeed decurrent of attenuation processes as stated by christensen et al 2000 or if the restricted studied periods could only permit the contaminant plumes to reach the mentioned extensions considering only the advection process the majority of the mentioned studies are associated with plumes generated within a period of 20 to 50 years which could feasibly result in plume extensions shorter than 1000 m based on commonly found groundwater flows and the advection transport mechanism in the case presented by this study the plume reached about 200 m after 30 years of the beginning of the waste disposal which can be associated with a groundwater flow velocity of about 7 m yr this value is feasible for the studied area sindico et al 2018 pmsc 2011 hence even concluding that the contaminant plume is restricted to 200 m from the deposit which seems to be rather limited it is still necessary to continue monitoring it in order to evaluate if there is a spreading with time and if the risks are inexistent when the plume reaches more urbanized areas moreover this study showed that there is no evidence of reduction of contaminants concentrations based on the geophysical surveys the evaluated sampling points and a 20 year monitoring period the possible natural attenuation understood by the combination of dilution dispersion retardation and degradation of contaminants causing a decrease in their concentrations in the studied area seemed to be significant spatially reducing the contaminants concentrations with the distance from the deposit but not temporally provided that not considerable changes in the measured resistivity values nor in the chemical parameters could be detected after 10 and 20 years of the deposits closure therefore even possibly not restricting other land and water uses on neighboring areas 500 m similar waste deposits and their close surroundings 200 m do not show a tendency of rehabilitation through natural remediation 20 years after the ending of disposal activities additionally it is important to highlight that the neighboring areas of the studied deposit have not been extensively characterized since the monitoring wells are not properly localized thus even though the measured parameters do not seem to be associated with risks to public health in the surroundings of the waste deposit areas of more significant resistivity anomalies have not been sampled and other pollutants of emerging concern and their byproducts may also be present attention must also be given to potentially toxic metals which could be found 200 m from the deposit accompanying the plume fringes finally in the present study geophysical surveys have been used as a first tool to map the plume adopting larger dipoles in order to investigate deeper zones even though the precision decreased with larger dipoles it has been proved that this in depth investigation is fundamental since smaller dipoles may cause misleading conclusions in similar areas in other words although the resolution of geophysical essays in 2018 is poorer the increase in the electrodes spacing enabled the investigation of depths 4 times deeper considering that no significant topographical change was observed since the aquifer is predominantly sandy and homogeneous the gain in depth was fundamental for the observation of the influence of the plume in the aquifer the detection of the contaminated zone even with worse resolution shows that the aquifer is strongly impacted by the presence of the waste deposit the use of smaller electrodes spacing restricted the visualization of the subsurface to its superior part not permitting the estimation of the volume affected by the contamination the estimation of this volume is fundamental to evaluate the extent of groundwater contamination and obtain a more comprehensive overview of the interaction between the deposit and the aquifer the geophysical results clearly show that even originated from domestic waste the contamination is considerably persistent in the long term 4 conclusion the long term geophysical assessment performed in the present study enabled the evaluation of contaminants transport and attenuation in geological formations constituted by sandstones and sandy soils the studied case has a complicating factor the presence of the waste deposit below the water table which could enhance groundwater contamination and plume dispersion nonetheless from the evaluation of the geophysical sections performed in 2018 with dipoles of 40 m and investigation depth of about 80 m the plume extension was restricted to 200 m long and 60 m deep agreeing with other studies conducted in sandy aquifers maurya et al 2017 bichet et al 2016 christensen et al 2000 2001 baun et al 2003 bjerg et al 2013 lyngkilde and christensen 1992 baedecker and apgar 1984 macfarlane et al 1983 even considering the presence of groundwater inside the waste deposit even seeming not to represent a risk due to its short extension the plume may have been formed as a result of the advection process and a groundwater flow velocity of about 7 m yr which is feasible for the guarani aquifer therefore it may not undergo attenuation but move together with the groundwater flow which makes it necessary to monitor the plume evolution in order to securely state that it does not represent a risk as it moves to urbanized regions regarding possible risks in the surrounding areas it has been found that some monitoring wells situated about 200 m from the deposit presented values of lead and cobalt above the screening values and have previously presented high concentrations of arsenic barium and selenium which caused concern even though heavy metals are not considered to be mobile in groundwater guarani aquifer recharge zones may present characteristics namely ph 5 0 in some regions which propitiate metals mobility making them possibly pose risks to the environment and public health the comparison of the geophysical models obtained from the different years surveys permitted to assume that a spreading to the w occurred after 20 years so that the plume was not limited to the gully s structure as previously expected additionally attenuation processes did not seem to be significant so that 20 years did not propitiate a considerable reduction of contaminants concentrations or resistivity values alongside the surveyed lines from this it can be predicted that the possibility of enabling different land uses in the neighboring areas beyond 500 m does not seem to represent environmental or public health risks nevertheless the rehabilitation of the waste disposal site and its close areas distant less than 200 m does not seem to occur naturally within a period of 20 years time finally it is essential to highlight the importance of correctly limiting waste deposits and adequately monitoring all their surroundings since hydraulic anomalies and diffusion may lead contaminants to spread to non expected regions supposedly upgradient additionally even being a known process it is still necessary to stimulate the adoption of geophysical surveys before drillings are made especially in developing countries so that the wells are correctly located and the plume can be appropriately monitored the adoption of dipoles as large as 40 m is also recommended in order to provide an in depth investigation and guide the next monitoring steps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

1535,even though attenuation processes in the subsurface are known to reduce the impacts of contaminant plumes their importance is significantly dependent on geological and climatic characteristics as well as on the leachate quality the knowledge of attenuation processes linked to different geological formations is therefore fundamental in predicting the impacts of waste disposal areas geophysical methods are useful tools for assessing and delineating contaminant plumes as well as their changes with time which enables their lower cost monitoring and association with geological and environmental properties this paper shows the results of geophysical surveys conducted in the years of 1996 2005 and 2018 in a waste disposal area located at a guarani aquifer recharge zone in brazil the objective of this study was to show the evolution of the contamination plume as well as discuss some possible transport and attenuation processes that the contaminants may undergo in similar areas five geophysical sections surveyed within a time span of 20 years were compared and the information was integrated with physicochemical data from monitoring wells the results show a horizontal plume spreading reaching about 200 m from the deposit and about 60 m of depth 20 years after the ending of disposal activities the measured resistivities in 2018 are similar to the ones found in 1996 and 2005 in the same surveyed areas showing that a significant temporal attenuation did not occur moreover samples collected close to anomaly zones and within a distance of 200 m from the deposit presented concentrations of some heavy metals above the screening values according to the brazilian legislation showing a metals mobility higher than previously expected which can be possibly explained by the aquifer s acidic conditions the estimated plume velocity was about 7 m yr a plume deepening was observed until about 50 m and changes in water flow direction and or diffusion processes made the plume spread to areas previously regarded as upgradient therefore the present paper shows that the rehabilitation of sites neighboring waste disposal sites less than 200 m from it did not seem to be feasible through natural attenuation in sandy soils and that the plume spreading is significant in this geological formation thus abandoned disposal areas constantly considered to be closed after the ending of disposal activities in developing countries generate plumes which move silently and may reach areas of concern in the future keywords waste deposits groundwater contamination geophysical surveys long term monitoring guarani aquifer 1 introduction waste deposits are significant sources of groundwater pollution since they generate highly contaminated leachates that percolate through the subsoil reaching the aquifers and altering them for decades or centuries after the ending of the disposal activities independently of the deposit size fetter et al 2018 the greatest difficulty in managing these areas mainly when not properly planned is related to the variability of the landfilled content from domestic residues to mineral industrial construction and demolition debris and even hazardous substances the random distribution of materials leads to the generation of plumes with different compositions which are also altered with time and depending on the local climatic conditions bjerg et al 2013 moreover the transport direction of these plumes may vary about 70 degrees adding complexity to their delineation and requiring the combination of different surveying methods and the adoption of a dense sampling grid for an adequate mapping christensen et al 2000 the geophysical methods are useful tools for complementing the physicochemical evaluation which sometimes cannot represent the plume variability and spreading especially when a comprehensive grid of monitoring wells is not available mao et al 2015 from them the geoelectrical methods have been extensively used as they provide visible contrasts between contaminated and non contaminated areas in terms of resistivity boudreault et al 2010 gasperikova et al 2012 bichet et al 2016 caterina et al 2017 maurya et al 2017 soupios and ntarlagiannis 2017 baawain et al 2018 simyrdanis et al 2018 which enables their application to studies involving the waste distribution in landfills audebert et al 2014 audebert et al 2016a audebert et al 2016b dumont et al 2016 de donno and cardarelli 2017 and the contaminant plumes temporal evolution surrounding landfills acworth and jorstad 2006 al tarazi et al 2008 lopes et al 2012 and uncontrolled landfills park et al 2016 di maio et al 2018 høyer et al 2019 it is important to highlight that monitoring waste deposits in different geological formations and climatic conditions is still of utmost importance since few contaminant plumes stemming from them have been entirely documented from the few existing studies which thoroughly document contaminant plumes originated from waste deposits it has been shown that transport and attenuation processes can promote a natural remediation of the contaminant plume limiting the environmental impacts to an area that does not generally exceed 1000 m from the deposit but can possibly reach more than 3000 m christensen et al 2000 the natural attenuation consists of the combination of several natural processes including dilution dispersion volatilization precipitation ion exchange sorption transformation and degradation which promote a reduction in the contaminants concentrations the intensity of the attenuation processes varies in function of the environmental conditions including the characteristics of the geological formation such as its granulometry and cation exchange capacity and the availability of electron acceptors christensen et al 2001 roling and van verseveld 2002 bjerg et al 2013 consequently the knowledge of the environmental characteristics associated with the plumes extents and their impacts can contribute to the adoption of management actions suitable for different contexts and conditions and consequently to a reduction of the number of areas that effectively need to be remediated therefore it is mandatory to provide the proper monitoring of contaminant plumes from different waste deposits geological formations and climatic conditions so that the contaminants behavior can be predicted and appropriate management actions can be adopted this paper shows the results of a comparative assessment of geophysical surveys conducted in the years of 1996 2005 and 2018 in an unplanned waste disposal area considered to be highly vulnerable to contamination the objective of the present research was to assess the evolution of the studied contaminant plume discuss the transport and attenuation processes that contaminants may undergo in similar areas and consequently estimate the risks these sites may pose to the environment in the long term 2 methodology 2 1 study area the studied waste deposit is located in são carlos city in the southeast region of brazil in a guarani aquifer recharge zone constituted by botucatu formation sandstones são carlos climatic conditions are classified as cfa by köppen geiger its average annual precipitation is about 1440 mm and its average temperature is 19 7 c the soils in the area can be classified in oxisols red yellow latosol and quartz sands based on the average hydraulic conductivity from 10 4 to 10 6 cm s on granulometric analysis fine to medium sands and on cation exchange capacity evaluation from 0 4 to 4 6 meq 100 g it is possible to affirm that the region where the deposit is located has medium to high vulnerability to contamination gonçalves 1986 freitas 1996 velozo 2006 a previous detailed investigation performed by pmsc 2011 showed that the geological formation in the area is consisted fundamentally of sandy soils see figures 1sm and 2sm of the supplementary material this information supported the interpretation of the geophysical sections making it possible to affirm that the variations in the resistivity values were essentially associated with the contamination plume and not with geological heterogeneities the waste disposal occurred in the mentioned region from 1980 to 1996 with the destination of domestic industrial construction and demolition and health service wastes in an old gully without any study of suitability or adoption of structures for groundwater and public health protection about 440 000m3 of solid waste covering an area of around 48 400m2 were disposed of in the area velozo 2006 moreover the location of the water table inside the waste massif is an aggravating factor to groundwater contamination considering these features the site has been included in the list of contaminated areas of the state of são paulo according to its state environmental agency cetesb 2017 additionally it is important to emphasize that the site is strategically important due to the high percentages of groundwater use for public water supply in the cities in the region achieving 50 in são carlos city and 100 in ribeirão preto a neighbor city because of its location importance and high groundwater contamination potential several studies have been conducted in the area rios 1993 bossolan 1993 menezes 1995 freitas 1996 gadotti 1997 matsuzaki 1998 álvares 2000 velozo 2006 pmsc 2011 shinzato 2014 pelinson 2018 from the studies there is a consensus in terms of the existence of high pollutants charges generated by the waste deposit associated with a relatively small influence area additionally some authors supposed that there are high attenuation and depuration capacities by the geological formation and the surface waters menezes 1995 freitas 1996 gadotti 1997 even though no estimation of the extent of the environmental impacts has been done therefore the previous studies showed that there are still high pollutants charges in the waste deposit but that the attenuation and transport processes in the surrounding geological formation are not totally understood consequently no intervention measure has been adopted and even though the area is considered to be vulnerable to contamination the studies have not shown significant impacts on the surroundings 2 2 historical data collection a historical data collection was performed in order to compare them and assess the evolution of the plume delineation with time the results obtained by gadotti 1997 and velozo 2006 were selected since they performed geophysical surveys and water samplings in the region in 1996 and 2005 respectively during the same hydrological season assessed in the present study dry season from june to august elis et al 2016 were also considered in view of the geophysical interpretation and the physicochemical analysis of samples collected in 2005 2 3 geophysical surveys geophysical data acquisition was carried out in august 2018 using a dipole dipole array and a syscal electrical resistivity meter similarly to the previous studies the data quality analysis was performed during their acquisition each measurement was made with the stacking minimum of 10 and the average and standard deviation values were calculated whenever the calculated standard deviation was greater than 3 the equipment continued to the maximum stacking of 20 for better results in case of noisy data a checking of the contacts between wires and electrodes was performed and repeated readings were conducted in order to guarantee the quality of the data within the standards beforementioned therefore no reading point was discarded and all had a standard deviation below 3 this protocol was stablished in order to maintain the pattern of acquisition of data from 1995 and 2005 when the acquisition system with intelligent electrodes was not available we consider that this acquisition methodology can be more effective in areas impacted by waste deposits than the discard of noisy data which is commonly conducted in multielectrode acquisitions the data collected in 2018 as well as in 1995 and 2005 were interpreted with res2dinv 3 4 geotomo software 2007 using the least square method and robust inversion five sections of about 700 m of extent located transversely to the waste deposit were surveyed and dipoles of 40 m were adopted the selected dipoles aimed at providing a more in depth investigation analysis propitiating an adequate mapping of the plume which could not be done formerly since the previous studies were conducted with dipoles of 10 m in sections of about 150 m of extent therefore the previous studies 1996 and 2005 provided a better detailing of the subsurface but also a restricted delineation of the plume some sections surveyed in 2018 coincided with others conducted in 1995 and 2005 and could thus be compared the different lines surveyed in the distinct years are shown in fig 1 since it was not clear if anomalies present in previous years were still existent in 2018 due to the different adopted dipoles and consequent precision of the results an extra line with dipoles of 2 5 m was surveyed above line 32 018 see fig 1 lines 2018 enabling the observation and comparison of anomaly intensities with time 2 4 sample collection groundwater samples were collected from existing monitoring wells in order to support the geophysical data analysis the samples were collected from wells p23 in line 1 p12 p2 and p3 in line 2 p13a p14 and leachate monitoring station lms in line 3 and p16 p17 p18 and p9 in line 4 line 5 did not present any monitoring well but crossed a small stream from which samples were also collected in locations upstream and downstream to the deposit sampling points up and dw2 respectively the localization of each sampling point is presented in fig 1 as well as along with the geophysical sections in figs 4 9 the sampling was performed in august 2018 and ph ec electrical conductivity cod chemical oxygen demand chloride and potentially toxic metals were analyzed following the procedures described by the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2012 it is important to highlight that the beforementioned procedure was conducted in 2018 for the years of 1996 and 2005 as described in item 2 2 physicochemical data was collected from gadotti 1997 and elis et al 2016 note that only ph ec cod and chloride were assesed in 1996 for wells p12 and p18 whereas only ec and chloride were analyzed in 2005 for surface water sampling points up and dw1 3 results and discussion 3 1 evolution of the quality of water resources figs 2 and 3 show the distribution of ec and ph values for the years 1996 2005 and 2018 all the physicochemical data as well as maps showing chemical oxygen demand cod and chloride concentrations are shown in the supplementary material table 1sm figures 3sm and 4sm respectively data concerning potentially toxic metals are presented whenever their levels exceeded the screening values along with the geophysical profiles item 3 2 it is important to note that the majority of the monitoring wells did not exist in 1995 nor in 2005 so that a more comprehensive scenario of the water resources contamination can only be observed in 2018 even so for the wells existent both in 1995 and 2018 it can be noted that p12 underwent a deterioration in water quality whereas p18 suffered a mild improvement this observation shows that the plume seems to have moved but did not attenuate over time additionally it is possible to note that the highest anomalies are present inside the waste deposit with decrease of ec values with distance from it even so the impact of the waste deposit in the surroundings is evident see p2 and p3 even not taking into consideration the appropriate location of monitoring wells and their filters 3 2 evolution of the geophysical profiles in this section the geophysical profiles located in close geographical coordinates are presented together in order to better compare the evolution of the plume the water level is presented whenever measured and only in areas where interpolation was possible monitoring wells are also depicted in the corresponding geographical location some topographical data variations could be noted in the different years possibly due to their obtention from different surveys and methods topographical maps in 1996 and 2005 and radar data acquisition in 2018 since the region s pedological sections see figures 1sm and 2sm of the supplementary material show the area as being fundamentally formed by sandy soils without geological heterogeneities the anomalies found in the geophysical sections were attributed to the waste deposit s influence fig 4 shows the resistivity models for line 1 of the 1996 survey and line 1 of the 2018 survey the water table is not shown since the existing monitoring well p23 was dry from the comparison of the resistivity models in fig 4 it is possible to note that the smaller dipole adopted in 1996 led to a higher subsurface detailing showing anomalies that may exist but are not visible for larger dipoles nonetheless it seems that the plume moved downwards achieving about 40 50 m of depth 20 years after the deposit s closure unfortunately the existing monitoring well was dry in both studied years 1996 and 2018 so that it was not possible to evaluate the level of contamination even so samples collected in 2017 during the same hydrological season showed very low electrical conductivity 40 μs cm see fig 2 the analysis does not exclude the possibility of contamination in the region since the well does not present the largest resistivity anomalies the most important conclusion from this first comparison is that there is evidence of contamination in an area considered to be upgradient the waste deposit based on its superficial limiting fig 1 and on p23 well profile sandy soils according to freitas 1996 additionally the plume seems to have moved downwards and possibly to the w but do not exceed 50 m of depth and about 200 m of extension the first consideration shows that either the establishment of the waste boundaries may not have appropriately respected the actual waste disposal or the diffusion may have played an important role on contaminants spreading in the area making contaminants reach upgradient regions it is important to highlight that the unplanned and uncontrolled disposal of residues in such areas may have possibly led to the existence of waste in unexpected areas i e outside the gully and on its surroundings fig 5 shows the comparison of line 2 of the 1996 survey and line 2 of the 2018 survey it is important to emphasize that the superficial extent of the line surveyed in 1996 corresponds to the boundaries of the waste deposit and that the waste deposit s depth is approximately 15 m velozo 2006 similarly to the previous comparison it is not possible to affirm that the anomalies of lowest resistivity do not exist in 2018 since they are restricted to about 5 to 10 m and may not be represented in surveys using larger dipoles nonetheless the order of magnitude of the anomalies of low resistivity is similar from about 5 10 ω m in 1996 to about 25 ω m in 2018 which does not show evidence of significant attenuation of contaminants 20 years after the deposit s closure on the other hand the spreading is evident in 1996 the plume seems to have been restricted to the gully s structure not achieving depths much larger than 20 m whereas in 2018 it reached about 80 m from the deposit and 60 m of depth once again the monitoring wells do not reach the areas of maximum anomalies which prevents the secure characterization of the contaminant plume even so as it can be observed from fig 2 a water quality deterioration occurred in the region of p12 which is compatible with the resistivity values from the geophysical model nonetheless this behavior was not expected since the well is supposedly situated upgradient the deposit see figure 5sm of the supplementary material and no waste was found during the drilling freitas 1996 which is compatible with the 1996 resistivity model thus the movement of the contaminant plume may be attributed to hydraulic conductivity anomalies common in waste deposit areas which according to christensen et al 2000 may lead to changes in the direction of the plume flux of until 70 degrees another mechanism that has possibly contributed to the observed plume behavior is the diffusion which may be significant in the studied area both mentioned processes summed to the irregular waste disposal show the importance of adequately monitoring all the surroundings of waste deposits wells p2 and p3 could only be sampled in 2018 since they did not exist in 1996 the values of ec fig 2 confirm the impacts of the deposit at this distance 80 m even the mentioned wells not properly reaching the areas of greatest anomalies moreover the evaluation of potentially toxic metals in the collected samples showed values of lead concentration of 20 μg l for p2 and of 70 μg l for p3 these values are higher than the brazilian screening value for this metal which is equal to 10 μg l cetesb 2016 p2 also presented concentration of cobalt almost twice as high 125 μg l as the screening value for this metal 70 μg l a previous technical study pmsc 2011 also showed high values of arsenic barium and selenium in p2 which were not detected in 2018 this situation is worrisome considering that wells which did not seem to present significant water quality deterioration in terms of the most commonly adopted parameters for waste disposal areas electrical conductivity chloride and organic matter may have high concentrations of potentially toxic metals moreover based on the resistivity model higher concentrations are expected at about 50 m deep it is important to emphasize that even though no background well could be found in the studied area since the previously considered upgradient well p23 was proven not to be the groundwater from the guarani aquifer is not expected to carry significant concentrations of these metals cetesb 2016 regarding the transport of heavy metals in groundwater it is a consensus that these substances have restricted mobility in these environments especially in neutral to basic conditions hem 1985 qasim and chiang 1994 fetter et al 2018 christensen et al 2001 thus two factors may have contributed to the existence of some high values in the surrounding area a the mixture of industrial waste in the studied dumpsite which can possibly have higher concentrations of these pollutants b the higher mobility of metals in acidic conditions ph 5 0 which are commonly found in the free and shallow areas of the guarani aquifer cetesb 2016 thus several recharge zones can propitiate a higher mobility of heavy metals being even more vulnerable from this point of view for the example of lead it has been reported that its sorption by soil is diminished when ph is below 4 61 fetter et al 2018 or below 5 0 qasim and chiang 1994 it is also important to note from fig 5 that the contaminants plume was not restricted to the gully s structure as expected by elis et al 2016 it moved downwards until about 40 m deep in the region of the waste massif and then started moving to the w and also in depth reaching about 60 m this behavior is attributed to the advection the most significant transport process below the water table whose main direction in the region is w or nw see figure 5sm of the supplementary material similarly to the previous resistivity sections the models depicted in fig 6 shows a plume spreading to the w achieving about 100 m far from the deposit and 30 m deep this movement tendency was detected in 2005 around the electrode situated in position 200 m at approximately 15 m deep however the plume extension could not be detected before 2018 the most significant anomalies for both models are situated inside the waste body and do not seem to have attenuated with time presenting values of about 5 10 ω m in the corresponding surveyed areas chemical analysis of the groundwater inside the massif could be performed in 2018 but not in 2005 as the monitoring wells did not exist before 2014 shinzato 2014 the physicochemical analysis fig 2 and figures 3sm and 4sm of the supplementary material evidences that there are high concentrations of pollutants inside the waste body especially in lms which is approximately 7 m deep and is entirely inside the massif the results of well p14 show the groundwater quality just bellow the massif since this monitoring well is about 20 m deep and its filter is situated approximately 4 m below the massif comparing the results of lms and p14 it is possible to observe that a mild decrease in pollutants concentrations occurred in the aquifer additionally the analysis of the geophysical profile permitted to observe a mild plume spreading to the ne similarly to fig 5 which has been attributed to flux anomalies and or diffusion in order to compare the intensity of the anomalies in 2018 with the ones found in 2005 a survey with dipoles of 2 5 m was conducted in the same position of line 3 2018 but within the waste deposit boundaries with about 110 m of extension the resulting resistivity model is presented in fig 7 with this analysis it was possible to note that there are still very low resistivity values inside the massif compatible with the ones found in previous years showing no attenuation evidence the residues are present until about 10 12 m and the disposal seems to accompany the gully s structure in the center of the gully a more intense downward leachate flow can be observed probably associated with the existence of a more important mass of waste additionally it is possible to notice that with smaller dipoles there is the impression that the plume is restricted to the gully s structure which was proven not to be true therefore it is important to advise that in similar studies larger dipoles are also adopted at least in one surveyed section so that the appropriate mapping of the plume is done likewise the previously analyzed sections fig 8 depicts the plume spreading to the w evident in 2018 but also noticed in 2005 position 100 m low resistivity values 25 ω m were still found in 2018 not only in the waste massif but also about 150 m far from the deposit and 40 m deep showing that spreading was not accompanied by contaminants attenuation the monitoring wells p16 p17 and p18 are situated in areas without waste deposition freitas 1996 pmsc 2011 but with a visible spreading of the contaminant plume once again the wells do not reach the zones with the most significant resistivity anomalies which makes assumptions concerning contamination levels in the zone less precise comparing the physicochemical parameters for the different studied years see fig 2 and the supplementary material it is possible to note that within a period of about 20 years no significant quality change occurred in the surroundings of p18 and if it happened the tendency was of degradation or transport of organic matter cod and generation of more soluble ionic components electrical conductivity it is interesting to note that the electrical conductivity in the region of p18 slightly increased with time which does not accompany the resistivity model where the conductivity values seem to have decreased in the region this contradiction can be possibly associated with the larger dipoles adopted so that the results can be considered an average of a more significant area regarding p9 p16 and p17 samples could be collected only in 2018 see figs 2 and 3 similarly to the behavior observed for line 2 2018 results above the screening values for lead were detected in p9 80 μg l which did not present significant physicochemical or resistivity anomalies this as before mentioned can be considered alarming since these substances could be found in areas without visible anomalies in the resistivity values nor in other physicochemical parameters it is important to highlight that lead concentrations above the screening value were also previously found in p9 pmsc 2011 finally the last compared resistivity sections fig 9 did not precisely correspond to the same spatial localization as it can be seen in fig 1 line 5 2018 and line 4 2005 nevertheless since they are both located in a region downstream to the deposit it is interesting to evaluate them in order to estimate the plume extension samples collected from the stream situated in the surroundings of electrode on position 1480 m of line 5 2018 sampling point dw2 figs 1 and 2 presented very low electrical conductivity in 2018 which is compatible with background ones up figs 1 and 2 therefore the anomalies found in line 5 2018 do not represent significant quality deterioration so that it is possible to affirm that the plume does not reach this distance about 500 m downstream the deposit in terms of surface water despite this a lower resistivity anomaly is visible at about 100 m deep between electrodes on positions 800 and 880 m it is not possible to securely affirm that this anomaly is originated from the waste deposit since there is no monitoring well at this position even so the tendency of the plume s deepening and transport to the w was detected in the other resistivity sections figs 5 6 and 8 making it feasible to consider that these areas are influenced by the waste deposit a similar behavior was detected in line 4 2005 with anomalies close to the surface corresponding to the existing stream and also in depth at about 15 m both compared lines show anomalies in the sw direction which is compatible with the previously found plume movement and thus strengthens the possibility of the anomalies being associated with contamination the analysis of the electrical conductivity values for sampling points up and dw1 in 2005 shows clear influence of the waste in the surface water although geophysical sections were not performed in an identical geographical position in 2018 samples could be collected in the same points previously analyzed in 2005 presenting electrical conductivity and chloride concentrations of 852 μs cm and 42 mg l in dw1 whereas in the upstream position up the values were 54 μs cm and 1 mg l respectively the results show that about 200 m downstream the waste deposit its impacts on surface water are still significant not having considerably changed 20 years after the ending of disposal activities a mild attenuation though seems to have occurred with a possible reduction of about 20 30 in the measured parameters values comparing line 4 2005 with line 5 2018 it is possible to affirm that spatial contaminants attenuation was more significant than the temporal one moreover from all the other sections analysis it is clear that the contaminants plume is not restricted to the gully s structure having spread downgradient as expected to the w but also in depth the in depth observed movement can be associated with this area being a recharge zone with expected downwards flow it is still fundamental to evaluate the water quality in the anomalies existent downstream the deposit so that a comprehensive characterization is performed in terms of the presence of potentially toxic metals in the surface water alongside the surveyed geophysical lines no anomaly was found neither 200 m nor 500 m from the deposit this indicates that the leachate does not only travel within the gully s structure as it was previously believed elis et al 2016 but also moves in the w direction additionally potentially toxic metals are less mobile in oxidant and neutral environments making them reach closer distances when compared to the groundwater species thus in this study higher concentrations of potentially toxic elements were found in the monitoring wells than in the surface water the present study permitted to conclude that even though the transport mechanisms in the evaluated waste disposal area could lead the contaminants to reach unexpected zones they generated plumes with dimensions restricted to 200 m of extension and 50 m of depth after about 30 years of the beginning of disposal activities this agrees with other studies conducted in sandy soils maurya et al 2017 bichet et al 2016 christensen et al 2000 bjerg et al 2013 lyngkilde and christensen 1992 baedecker and apgar 1984 macfarlane et al 1983 even considering that in the studied case the residues are below the water table nevertheless it is necessary to question if this plume delineation is indeed decurrent of attenuation processes as stated by christensen et al 2000 or if the restricted studied periods could only permit the contaminant plumes to reach the mentioned extensions considering only the advection process the majority of the mentioned studies are associated with plumes generated within a period of 20 to 50 years which could feasibly result in plume extensions shorter than 1000 m based on commonly found groundwater flows and the advection transport mechanism in the case presented by this study the plume reached about 200 m after 30 years of the beginning of the waste disposal which can be associated with a groundwater flow velocity of about 7 m yr this value is feasible for the studied area sindico et al 2018 pmsc 2011 hence even concluding that the contaminant plume is restricted to 200 m from the deposit which seems to be rather limited it is still necessary to continue monitoring it in order to evaluate if there is a spreading with time and if the risks are inexistent when the plume reaches more urbanized areas moreover this study showed that there is no evidence of reduction of contaminants concentrations based on the geophysical surveys the evaluated sampling points and a 20 year monitoring period the possible natural attenuation understood by the combination of dilution dispersion retardation and degradation of contaminants causing a decrease in their concentrations in the studied area seemed to be significant spatially reducing the contaminants concentrations with the distance from the deposit but not temporally provided that not considerable changes in the measured resistivity values nor in the chemical parameters could be detected after 10 and 20 years of the deposits closure therefore even possibly not restricting other land and water uses on neighboring areas 500 m similar waste deposits and their close surroundings 200 m do not show a tendency of rehabilitation through natural remediation 20 years after the ending of disposal activities additionally it is important to highlight that the neighboring areas of the studied deposit have not been extensively characterized since the monitoring wells are not properly localized thus even though the measured parameters do not seem to be associated with risks to public health in the surroundings of the waste deposit areas of more significant resistivity anomalies have not been sampled and other pollutants of emerging concern and their byproducts may also be present attention must also be given to potentially toxic metals which could be found 200 m from the deposit accompanying the plume fringes finally in the present study geophysical surveys have been used as a first tool to map the plume adopting larger dipoles in order to investigate deeper zones even though the precision decreased with larger dipoles it has been proved that this in depth investigation is fundamental since smaller dipoles may cause misleading conclusions in similar areas in other words although the resolution of geophysical essays in 2018 is poorer the increase in the electrodes spacing enabled the investigation of depths 4 times deeper considering that no significant topographical change was observed since the aquifer is predominantly sandy and homogeneous the gain in depth was fundamental for the observation of the influence of the plume in the aquifer the detection of the contaminated zone even with worse resolution shows that the aquifer is strongly impacted by the presence of the waste deposit the use of smaller electrodes spacing restricted the visualization of the subsurface to its superior part not permitting the estimation of the volume affected by the contamination the estimation of this volume is fundamental to evaluate the extent of groundwater contamination and obtain a more comprehensive overview of the interaction between the deposit and the aquifer the geophysical results clearly show that even originated from domestic waste the contamination is considerably persistent in the long term 4 conclusion the long term geophysical assessment performed in the present study enabled the evaluation of contaminants transport and attenuation in geological formations constituted by sandstones and sandy soils the studied case has a complicating factor the presence of the waste deposit below the water table which could enhance groundwater contamination and plume dispersion nonetheless from the evaluation of the geophysical sections performed in 2018 with dipoles of 40 m and investigation depth of about 80 m the plume extension was restricted to 200 m long and 60 m deep agreeing with other studies conducted in sandy aquifers maurya et al 2017 bichet et al 2016 christensen et al 2000 2001 baun et al 2003 bjerg et al 2013 lyngkilde and christensen 1992 baedecker and apgar 1984 macfarlane et al 1983 even considering the presence of groundwater inside the waste deposit even seeming not to represent a risk due to its short extension the plume may have been formed as a result of the advection process and a groundwater flow velocity of about 7 m yr which is feasible for the guarani aquifer therefore it may not undergo attenuation but move together with the groundwater flow which makes it necessary to monitor the plume evolution in order to securely state that it does not represent a risk as it moves to urbanized regions regarding possible risks in the surrounding areas it has been found that some monitoring wells situated about 200 m from the deposit presented values of lead and cobalt above the screening values and have previously presented high concentrations of arsenic barium and selenium which caused concern even though heavy metals are not considered to be mobile in groundwater guarani aquifer recharge zones may present characteristics namely ph 5 0 in some regions which propitiate metals mobility making them possibly pose risks to the environment and public health the comparison of the geophysical models obtained from the different years surveys permitted to assume that a spreading to the w occurred after 20 years so that the plume was not limited to the gully s structure as previously expected additionally attenuation processes did not seem to be significant so that 20 years did not propitiate a considerable reduction of contaminants concentrations or resistivity values alongside the surveyed lines from this it can be predicted that the possibility of enabling different land uses in the neighboring areas beyond 500 m does not seem to represent environmental or public health risks nevertheless the rehabilitation of the waste disposal site and its close areas distant less than 200 m does not seem to occur naturally within a period of 20 years time finally it is essential to highlight the importance of correctly limiting waste deposits and adequately monitoring all their surroundings since hydraulic anomalies and diffusion may lead contaminants to spread to non expected regions supposedly upgradient additionally even being a known process it is still necessary to stimulate the adoption of geophysical surveys before drillings are made especially in developing countries so that the wells are correctly located and the plume can be appropriately monitored the adoption of dipoles as large as 40 m is also recommended in order to provide an in depth investigation and guide the next monitoring steps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

1536,the concept of chaotic advection is a novel approach that has the potential to overcome some of the challenges associated with mixing of reagents that commonly occur when injection based in situ treatment techniques are used the rotated potential mixing rpm flow system is one configuration which has been theorized to achieve chaotic advection in porous media and enhance reagent mixing by periodically re oriented dipole pumping at a series of radial wells prior to field implementation of chaotic advection the selection of an rpm flow protocol will likely require a numerical model that can adequately represent groundwater flow within the zone of interest as expected the hydraulic conductivity k field is the most critical input requirement for the selected groundwater flow model hydraulic tomography ht is an innovative characterization approach that has shown potential to provide information on a k field in this investigation we explored whether the same well system required to invoke chaotic advection can also be applied in a ht analysis and evaluated the use of the generated k tomogram for the selection of rpm flow parameters that can enhance reagent mixing a series of dipole pumping tests were conducted within an area of interest as defined by the limits of the circular network of eight injection extraction wells used to invoke chaotic advection hydraulic head data collected from independent dipole pumping tests were used in an inverse model to perform steady state hydraulic tomography ssht analysis to generate a k tomogram both the k tomogram and an effective parameter approach i e a single k value assigned across the entire spatial domain as determined by single well pumping and slug tests produced estimates of hydraulic head that closely resembled those observed due to the relative homogeneous nature of the aquifer and the small spatial scale of the area of interest in contrast particle tracking results showed that incorporating a heterogeneous k field significantly enhanced the spatial distribution of particle trajectories indicative of reagent mixing these findings support the hypothesis that the same well system used to invoke chaotic advection can be combined with ssht analysis as a viable site characterization tool for delineating the spatial variability of k incorporating this k tomogram in a groundwater flow model with a particle tracking engine can be used as a design tool to aid in the selection of a site specific rpm flow protocol to achieve enhanced reagent mixing keywords chaotic advection groundwater in situ remediation hydraulic tomography subsurface heterogeneity rpm flow 1 introduction in situ treatment commonly involves the injection of a reagent into the subsurface to create a zone in which biological and or chemical reactions lead to the mass destruction of contaminants e g enhanced biodegradation chemical oxidation reduction in these injection driven remedial systems the delivery of reagent solutions is a key requirement for success following the injection of a reagent solution the reagent and contaminant must come in contact in the subsurface for the desired biological or chemical reactions to occur kitanidis and mccarty 2012 this contact between the injected reagent and contaminant is the desired outcome of an effective delivery system however it is often hindered by subsurface heterogeneities that create preferential flow pathways at a range of spatial scales dagan 1986 scheibe and yabusaki 1998 which leads to a non uniform distribution of the injected reagent for conventional injection methods that use vertical wells the injected reagent distribution will be greater in areas of higher hydraulic conductivity k payne et al 2008 as the fluid follows the path of least resistance from the wellbore into the porous medium depending on the k contrast perhaps due to the presence of small scale structures in sedimentary deposits e g bedding planes laminations fractures etc the injected reagent may bypass adjacent regions of lower k saenton et al 2002 dagan and neuman 2005 zhong et al 2011 in these lower k zones molecular diffusion d 10 9 m2 s is the primary transport mechanism responsible to bring the injected reagent and contaminant together jose and cirpka 2004 gale et al 2015 however diffusion is a slow process which contributes to inefficient mixing kitanidis and mccarty 2012 ineffective mixing can lead to partial removal of the contaminant mass in a source zone which results in eventual rebound of contaminant levels and long term persistence of plumes thomson et al 2008 contributing to lengthy remediation timelines kitanidis and mccarty 2012 the concept of chaotic advection trefry et al 2012 aref et al 2017 has the potential to overcome some of these challenges associated with mixing and improve reagent distribution in the subsurface chaotic advection has been defined as the creation of small scale structures resulting from the repeated stretching and folding of fluid elements in a laminar flow regime ottino 1989 aref et al 2017 this stretching and folding of individual fluid parcels yields highly complex intersecting particle trajectories which has been theorized to enhance the spatial distribution of solutes in porous media and increase the zone of contact across which reactions can occur ottino 1989 bagtzoglou and oates 2007 lester et al 2009 mays and neupauer 2012 the small scale structures act to stir the fluid to elements at length scales small enough for diffusion to contribute to efficient mixing aref et al 2017 one configuration which has been theoretically and experimentally used to achieve chaotic advection in porous media involves periodically re oriented dipole flow through the transient switching of pressures at a series of radial wells this configuration has been termed rotated potential mixing rpm flow in the relevant literature metcalfe et al 2008 and assumes a completely closed system where the fluid removed from the extraction well is immediately re injected at the injection well trefry et al 2012 in an rpm flow protocol a dipole consisting of one injection and one extraction well separated by 180 operates for a fixed time t p this dipole is then instantaneously re oriented by a specified reorientation angle θ and resumes pumping for t p a repeated sequence of this periodically re oriented dipole pumping will eventually produce chaos in the flow regime corresponding to complex particle trajectories lester et al 2009 metcalfe et al 2010 in an rpm flow system the reorientation angle θ pumping duration t p and flow rate q have been identified as key parameters metcalfe et al 2010 the selection of rpm flow parameters t p θ and q is critical for successful implementation of chaotic advection in the field lester et al 2010 trefry et al 2012 determination of an rpm flow protocol will likely require a numerical model that can adequately represent groundwater flow within an aquifer undergoing periodically re oriented dipole pumping it is expected that the k field will be the critical data requirement for the groundwater flow model it is widely accepted that accurate estimation of the k field can have significant implications for groundwater flow contaminant transport and hence on the design of an effective remediation system to achieve the desired treatment outcomes illman et al 2008 berg and illman 2013 traditional k characterization methods i e pumping tests yield effective parameters which are averaged over a large volume and are representative only of bulk flow behavior brauchler et al 2011 other k characterization methods like slug tests yield a single k estimate for a small aquifer volume in the immediate vicinity of the piezometer freeze and cherry 1979 using geostatistical interpolation to obtain a spatial distribution of k requires a large number of small scale k measurements from cores or slug tests which is both expensive and time consuming yeh and liu 2000 liu et al 2007 berg and illman 2013 for instance sudicky 1986 obtained over 1279 k estimates from falling head permeameter tests on core samples to delineate the spatial variability of a k field in contrast hydraulic tomography ht is a novel characterization approach that has shown potential to provide information on a k field ht involves pumping or injecting water into a well monitoring the aquifer response at nearby well locations and then repeatedly switching the pumping or injection locations yeh and liu 2000 zhu and yeh 2005 the drawdown responses collected from a ht survey are subsequently used in an inverse model to generate an image of the k distribution i e k tomogram transient hydraulic tomography tht yields a tomogram of both k and specific storage s s both steady state and transient ht have been used to characterize aquifer heterogeneities in laboratory scale sandbox experiments and in the field liu et al 2007 illman et al 2007 berg and illman 2011 berg and illman 2013 zhao and illman 2018 zha et al 2019 results from these studies indicate that use of k tomograms lead to considerably improved prediction of aquifer responses during a pumping test forward simulations using k tomograms as the representation of the k field consistently showed the highest correlation between simulated and observed drawdown in comparison to the effective parameter approach i e a single k value assigned across the entire spatial domain and other methods e g k fields from interpolation of small scale measurements in this paper we propose that the well system required to invoke chaotic advection can also be applied in a ht analysis and explore whether subsequent use of this k tomogram in a groundwater flow model can aid in the design of an rpm flow system the specific objectives were to assess whether hydraulic head responses from multiple independent dipole pumping tests can be used in three dimensional 3d steady state hydraulic tomography ssht analysis to capture k heterogeneities and then to investigate the impact of using this k tomogram on the selection of an rpm flow protocol and the spatial distribution of a hypothetical reagent the findings from this investigation are significant since the ability to use the same well system to invoke chaotic advection as that used as a site characterization tool to delineate k variability would be advantageous using k information applicable to a specific target treatment zone would allow for improved design of a chaotic advection system which would ultimately lead to enhanced treatment effectiveness 1 1 hydraulic tomography ht survey the ht survey was performed in an experimental gate located in the sandpit at the university of waterloo research aquifer facility at canadian forces base cfb in borden ontario the gate was 8 m wide by 11 m long and hydraulically isolated on two sides by hanging sheet pilings driven down to 2 m below ground surface bgs the other two sides had 2 5 m wide openings in the center that allowed groundwater to flow through the cell controlled by the regional horizontal hydraulic gradient in the upper 2 m of the aquifer the unconfined borden aquifer at this location is composed primarily of unconsolidated fine to medium grained well sorted sand porosity of 0 33 that extends 9 m in thickness and underlain by a clayey and sandy silt aquitard some microscale heterogeneities are present in the form of silty sand and coarse sand lenses the water table varies seasonally but is typically located at 0 6 m bgs mackay et al 1986 sudicky 1986 the specific storage is reported to range from 3 3 10 5 to 1 0 10 3 m 1 moench 2008 frind et al 1999 previous analysis of soil cores collected from cfb borden reported a range of horizontal k from 6 0 10 6 to 2 0 10 4 m s with a geometric mean of 6 8 10 5 m s geostatistical analyses of the k estimates from the core samples indicated that the average horizontal and vertical correlation lengths and variance of lnk σ2 lnk are 4 75 m 0 2 m and 0 2 respectively sudicky 1986 woodbury and sudicky 1991 rivett et al 1994 turcke and kueper 1996 tomlinson et al 2003 the vertical hydraulic conductivity is estimated to be approximately one third of the horizontal mackay et al 1986 sudicky 1986 within the gate eight 8 injection extraction wells identified as ie 1 to ie 8 were installed in a circular network with an approximate diameter of 1 75 m fig 1 around a center injection well iw all boreholes were advanced using a direct push method geoprobe 7720dt to a depth of 2 m bgs while the casing was pulled back to surface the aquifer material was allowed to collapse around the 5 1 cm diameter well schedule 40 pvc each ie well and the iw was screened 2 5 mm slot from 0 75 to 1 75 m bgs all wells were developed after installation eight 8 single well pumping tests and a series of slug tests a total of six 6 falling and rising head tests were performed at each ie well to obtain estimates of k the single well pumping tests were performed using a peristaltic pump cole parmer masterflex 7549 32 with masterflex 7019 43 pump head with a flow rate of 3 l min for 35 to 40 min until apparent steady state conditions were established i e when insignificant changes were observed in the hydraulic heads at all ie well locations once the pumping test was finished a recovery period 20 to 30 min was implemented to allow water levels to return to baseline conditions prior to the start of the next test slug tests were performed using a bailer 2 m in length which was placed into the respective ie well and removed after 2 to 3 min an above ground injection extraction system fig s1 that consisted of sixteen 16 solenoid valves asco red hat 8210g002 120 60 110 50 connected to a peristaltic pump masterflex 7549 32 with masterflex 7019 43 pump head and a programmable logic controller plc unit allen bradley 1760 l18awa ex ser b with 1760 ia12xow6i ser a expansion was used for the ht survey check valves were placed at the end of each solenoid valve to prevent potential clogging and malfunction since solenoid valves are one directional and unable to withstand backpressure from pumping dedicated pvc tubing was attached to the respective solenoid valve pair and placed in each ie well the end of each pvc tubing 10 cm in length was prepared with 3 9 mm holes and wrapped with 125 μm nitex screen the ht survey consisted of two data collection stages during stage 1 a series of independent dipole pumping tests were conducted using the eight ie wells see table 1 for the well pairs involved in each test and the above ground injection extraction system fig s1 each pumping test involved only one active dipole one injection and one extraction well with all other wells inactive the independent dipole pumping tests were performed using a high q 3 l min and a low q 1 8 l min flow rate each test was run until apparent steady state conditions were established as indicated by insignificant changes in the observed hydraulic heads at all ie well locations after each independent dipole pumping test a rest period 15 min was implemented to allow sufficient time for the hydraulic head changes resulting from the pumping to return to baseline conditions steady state observations of hydraulic heads from select independent dipole pumping tests were then used in the inverse model to generate a k tomogram the remainder of the dipole pumping tests not used in the ssht analysis were compared to the simulated predictions of steady state hydraulic heads for validation of the k tomogram during stage 2 a complete rpm flow protocol was implemented using the dipole pumping system where each ie well pair was operated for t p 1 h at q rpm 1 8 l min after duration t p the active dipole was turned off i e valves closed and re oriented by the reorientation angle θ 45 before pumping resumed at the new dipole using the same t p and q rpm this periodically re oriented dipole pumping was repeated around the ie well network for 6 days i e 18 complete rpm cycles n 18 observations of transient hydraulic heads collected during the implementation of this rpm flow protocol were compared to simulated hydraulic heads for validation of the k tomogram a submersible datalogger ctd diver van essen instruments kitchener on was placed in each ie well eight 8 in total and collected measurements of pressure every minute all pressure transducer readings were barometrically corrected a total of eight 8 flow meters assured automation wm pc 050 dedicated to each dipole recorded the cumulative volume of groundwater pumped from each extraction to injection well over the duration of each test 1 2 modeling approach hydraulic head data collected from select independent dipole pumping tests were used in an inverse model to perform ssht analysis to generate an estimate of the k field i e k tomogram to assess the impact of using this k tomogram in a three dimensional 3d groundwater flow model simulated steady state hydraulic heads were compared to those observed during the independent dipole pumping tests a 3d transient groundwater flow model was also developed and used to simulate the hydraulic response of the borden aquifer during an rpm flow protocol this 3d transient model was subsequently extended to include particle tracking and used to investigate the impact of this k tomogram on the spatial distribution of particle trajectories in a target treatment zone as an indicator of reagent mixing for validation of the estimated k field all forward simulations were performed using the k tomogram ssht scenario determined from the inversion of steady state hydraulic head observations during the independent dipole pumping tests and compared to the effective parameter approach k eff scenario in which a single value of k was assigned across the entire spatial domain as the representation of the k field 1 3 steady state hydraulic tomography ssht analysis of multiple dipole pumping tests 1 3 1 inverse modeling method the ssht analysis of independent dipole pumping tests was performed using the sequential successive linear estimator ssle model developed by yeh and liu 2000 all inverse simulations were completed using a finite element mesh 8 m by 11 m by 9 m fig s2 which consisted of rectangular elements variable in size in the central portion of the model domain where all field tests were conducted 0 25 m by 0 25 m by 0 25 m size elements were used outside this central portion the element size was increased to 0 5 m by 0 5 m in the x and y directions in the z direction where z 0 coincides with the underlying aquitard one element was assigned from 0 to 6 5 m and 10 elements δz 0 25 m from 6 5 to 9 m corresponding to the depth of the sheet pilings 0 to 2 m bgs in total the model domain consisted of 6776 elements 28 22 11 and 8004 nodes 29 23 12 the bottom and portions of the model domain that correspond to the location and depth of the sheet pilings were assigned no flow boundary conditions along all other boundaries a constant head boundary condition was employed and assigned a value of 9 m during the ht survey the water table was near ground surface and thus we assumed that the domain was fully saturated additional input parameters specified were initial estimates of k as well as geostatistical parameters correlation lengths λ x λ y λ z and variance see table 2 the specification of correlation lengths allows mapping of heterogeneity in the vertical direction despite all wells being screened over the same depth interval pumping wells were assigned as source sink terms in the elements corresponding to the location of ie well pair involved in each dipole pumping test with estimated flow rates from the field hydraulic head responses were selected from the steady state portion of the change in hydraulic head profiles associated with each independent dipole pumping test convergence criteria were considered to be met when either the change in the estimated k field was below a minimum threshold i e variance between iterations 0 001 or the maximum number iterations n 500 was achieved 1 3 2 calibration and validation of k tomogram using the ssle to assess whether the use of the k tomogram leads to improved predictions of hydraulic head responses during an independent dipole pumping test 3d simulations of steady state groundwater flow were performed using the ssle model with the k tomogram as the representation of the k distribution these steady state simulation results using the k tomogram were then compared to those generated by the effective parameter approach in which a single value of k as determined by the single well pumping and slug tests was assigned across the entire spatial domain scatterplots were used to illustrate the relationship between simulated and observed values of hydraulic head changes model calibration was examined by incorporating the k tomogram in the 3d forward ssle model to simulate the steady state hydraulic responses during the independent dipole pumping tests used in the inversion process these calibration simulations examine how well the computed k tomogram was able to reproduce the observations of hydraulic head used in the inverse model for model validation predictions of steady state hydraulic head were generated using the 3d forward ssle model for the independent dipole pumping tests not used in the ssht analysis illman et al 2007 berg and illman 2013 for each scatterplot the best fit line consisting of the slope intercept and coefficient of determination r 2 was estimated and compared to the 1 1 line which represents a perfect match between the simulated and observed values of hydraulic head changes a strong correlation between the simulated and observed hydraulic head changes would lead to points scattering along the 1 1 line to further assess how well the change in simulated values of hydraulic head compare to the observed the mean absolute error norm l 1 and mean square error norm l 2 associated with each scatterplot were calculated for the independent pumping tests xiang et al 1992 berg and illman 2013 1 l 1 m 1 n i 1 n χ i χ i 2 l 2 m 2 1 n i 1 n χ i χ i 2 where n is the number of hydraulic head observations and χ i and χ i are simulated and observed change in hydraulic head meters respectively the l 1 and l 2 norms are useful model performance metrics with smaller values of l 1 and l 2 norms indicative of simulated estimates of hydraulic head changes that are closer to the observed illman et al 2007 berg and illman 2015 while the l 1 norm is a useful indicator of the overall model performance the l 2 norm gives more weight to larger differences leading to detection of potential outliers xiang et al 1992 1 4 3d transient flow simulations simulations were performed using a 3d transient groundwater flow model to investigate the impact of using the k tomogram as the representation of the k field on predictions of hydraulic heads and on the spatial distribution of particle trajectories during repeated cycles of rpm flow the development of a numerical model that can represent groundwater flow during periodically re oriented dipole pumping is a critical step towards the design of an effective rpm flow system the 3d transient simulations were performed using the modflow 2005 and modpath engines in visual modflow flex version 2015 1 waterloo hydrogeologic kitchener ontario canada the dimensions of the domain as well as boundary conditions used for these transient simulations were the same as those used in ssle model however this domain was discretized with the smallest grid blocks 0 05 m by 0 05 m by 0 05 m in the central portion of the domain where all field tests were conducted a smaller discretization was selected for this model domain to adequately represent the complexities in the flow fields produced by the transient rpm flow system outside this central portion the grid blocks were increased to 0 1 m by 0 1 m in the x and y directions in the z direction one block was assigned from 0 to 6 5 m and 50 blocks δz 0 05 m from 6 5 to 9 m in total the finite difference grid was composed of 110 rows 140 columns and 51 layers fig s3 pumping wells were assigned to the appropriate layers of the model grid with a time dependent schedule that corresponds to the ie well pair involved in the rpm flow protocol cumulative volumes obtained from flow meter data were used to estimate the average flow rate for each dipole i e q rpm 1 2 to 2 4 l min and q rpm 1 8 l min across all dipoles a value of 0 26 was used for the specific yield s y to represent this shallow unconfined aquifer system and the effective porosity was assumed to be 0 33 mackay et al 1986 the k tomogram generated from the ssht analysis was imported into visual modflow flex and assigned as an interpolated surface to the corresponding layer of the finite difference grid for the k eff scenario the same k value used in the steady state ssle model was assumed for the entire model domain the conjugate gradient solver cgs was used in the modflow engine with a convergence criterion of 10 7 m a scatterplot was used to show the relationship between simulated values of hydraulic head and those observed during rpm flow and to determine a best fit regression line in addition to the l 1 and l 2 norms the correlation coefficient r was determined for the transient simulation results produced by both the ssht and k eff scenarios using mccuen and snyder 1986 liu et al 2007 3 r 1 n i 1 n χ i μ χ χ i μ χ 1 n i 1 n χ i μ χ 2 1 n i 1 n χ i μ χ 2 where n is the number of hydraulic head observations χ i and χ i are simulated and observed values of hydraulic head changes at a given time respectively and μ χ and μ χ are the corresponding means of the simulated and observed hydraulic head changes respectively the r value is a quantitative metric that indicates the strength of correlation between observed and simulated values with higher values of r 1 representing stronger correlation between the two data sets mccuen and snyder 1986 liu et al 2007 to investigate the consequence of using the k tomogram on the selection of an rpm flow protocol and the spatial distribution of a hypothetical reagent injected from the iw fig 1 the 3d transient groundwater flow model was extended to include particle tracking using the modpath engine these particle tracking simulations represent a reagent solution previously injected at the center of the circular ie well network that is subsequently mixed by an rpm flow system for this investigation 48 particles were assigned in the cells immediately adjacent to the center of the circular network of the ie wells at a depth that corresponds to the midpoint of the well screens these initial particle positions are indicative of the approximate location of the hypothetical injected reagent solution all particles were treated as forward tracking particles various combinations of rpm flow parameters reorientation angle θ and pumping duration t p were assessed for their ability to produce an enhanced spatial distribution of particle trajectories and thus an increase in the cumulative travel distance within the area of interest as defined by the limits of the ie wells to represent a target treatment zone using the spatial distribution of particle trajectories as an indicator of reagent mixing and as a criterion for the selection of rpm flow parameters supports the theory that chaotic advection results from the stretching and folding of fluid elements which produce highly complex intersecting particle trajectories that can lead to enhanced reagent mixing ottino 1989 lester et al 2009 2 results and discussion 2 1 effective hydraulic conductivity to determine k estimates in the area of interest by traditional characterization methods the data collected from the single well pumping and slug tests were analyzed using aquifertest waterloo hydrogeologic kitchener ontario canada table 3 the k estimate ranges from 5 3 10 5 to 7 6 10 5 m s based on the single well pumping test data and from 4 1 10 5 to 7 1 10 5 m s using the slug test data the k estimates from the single well pumping tests are slightly higher than those produced by the slug tests presumably due to the larger spatial scale captured by the test overall the data from both tests yield a similar range of k estimates with a geometric mean of 6 3 10 5 m s for the single well pumping tests and 5 4 10 5 m s for the slug tests since this difference is small the horizontal k eff value in the area of interest was assumed to be the combined geometric mean of 5 8 10 5 m s i e k xx k yy the vertical hydraulic conductivity k z was assumed to be one third of this value to be consistent with previous findings for the borden aquifer mackay et al 1986 sudicky 1986 this k eff value is within the typical range reported for the borden aquifer i e 6 0 10 6 to 2 0 10 4 m s and is consistent with the geometric mean 6 8 10 5 m s of the k estimates reported in other studies using soil cores from this site sudicky 1986 woodbury and sudicky 1991 rivett et al 1994 turcke and kueper 1996 collectively these results indicate that the k eff value determined from the single well pumping and slug test data is a reasonable assumption for the k value used in the effective parameter approach 2 2 hydraulic responses fig 2 shows the observed hydraulic head changes relative to baseline conditions for all ie wells for two of the eight independent dipole pumping tests conducted at the high flow rate q 3 1 1 l min see fig s4 for the other test results only the hydraulic head observations from the dipole pumping tests performed at the high flow rate were used in the ssht analysis based on the previous work of illman et al 2008 who demonstrated that increased pumping rates yield higher signal to noise ratios in the data collected from a ht survey and lead to improved predictions of the k field a positive hydraulic head change implies that water was being injected into the well while a negative hydraulic head change implies that water was being extracted from the well steady state conditions appear to be established within 2 min of pumping at each ie well with steady state hydraulic head changes ranging from 29 to 49 cm during injection and from 48 to 25 cm during extraction fig 2 hydraulic head changes are evident at the wells located 0 7 m on either side of the injection extraction wells with hydraulic heads approximately an order of magnitude less than those observed at the active dipoles minor fluctuations in hydraulic head 0 5 cm are observed at wells furthest away from the active ie wells fig 3 shows the observed hydraulic head changes relative to baseline conditions at all ie wells during rpm flow fig 3 a shows the change in hydraulic heads over the entire duration of the test when rpm flows are active n 18 t total 6 days while fig 3 b shows the response to dipole pumping for the first 8 h of the test n 1 despite some fluctuations the dipole system operated as expected with one ie well pair pumping for one hour before switching to the next pair the frequency of the peak hydraulic head changes corresponds to the switching time t p of 1 h associated with the dipole pumping system with peak hydraulic head changes ranging from 18 to 72 cm during injection and 57 to 18 cm during extraction as expected the hydraulic head changes during extraction are less than those observed during injection for shallow wells in an unconfined aquifer freeze and cherry 1979 the suppressed amplitudes relative to the other ie wells during the fourth ie 4 and ie 8 and fifth ie 1 and ie 5 dipoles in the rpm flow pumping sequence fig 3 b is suspected to be the result of poor connection contact between the solenoid valve wiring and the plc unit that failed to provide the electrical signal required to open the valve and permit flow 2 3 visual assessment of the k tomogram sixteen 16 steady state observations of hydraulic head from two different dipole pumping tests test g and test b were used sequentially in the ssht analysis the specific number and order of dipole pumping tests used in the inversion process were determined based on the combination of tests that produced a k tomogram within the range of k values observed from the single well pumping and slug tests in the area of interest previous work has shown that both the number and order of observations used in the inversion process are critical considerations in ht analysis as they impact the quality of the resulting k tomogram illman et al 2008 berg and illman 2011 the final k tomogram for the domain depth corresponding to the sheet pilings i e 0 to 2 m bgs and associated variance are shown in fig 4 the upper 0 4 m of the domain red regions of the k tomogram in fig 4 a shows k estimates that are higher than those observed from the single well pumping and slug tests in the area of interest table 3 however this depth is above the well screen where no hydraulic head observations were available and thus is expected to produce greater uncertainty in the k estimates elsewhere in the area of interest the k estimates are within the observed range i e 4 1 10 5 to 7 6 10 5 m s the mean k within the area of interest from the k tomogram is 4 1 10 5 m s which is slightly lower than the k eff value 5 8 10 5 m s and near the lower limit of the observed k range based on the single well pumping and slug test data the slight difference between these two mean k values is likely related to the spatial scale associated with each estimation method the k tomogram provides a representation of the k distribution across the entire zone of interest and captures vertical k variability whereas the estimate from the single well pumping and slug test data yield a bulk estimate of k the final k tomogram fig 4 a shows elongated zones of primarily horizontal parallel layering that span across 6 m in the x and y directions without interruptions by lower k features horizons variability in the z direction is observed with k estimates that range within an order of magnitude across layers 0 25 m in thickness these observations are consistent with previous efforts that have described the borden aquifer as relatively homogeneous with horizontal and vertical correlation lengths of 4 75 m and 0 2 m respectively sudicky 1986 woodbury and sudicky 1991 rivett et al 1994 turcke and kueper 1996 tomlinson et al 2003 furthermore the sequential inversion of the dipole pumping tests produced a k field with a variance of ln k σ 2 lnk of 1 6 for the entire model domain this value is determined by the ssle model as a variance of the k estimates assigned to each of the elements in the modeling domain i e 6776 estimates in total and represents the overall degree of heterogeneity yeh and liu 2000 while σ 2 lnk values typically reported for the borden aquifer range from 0 3 to 0 6 woodbury and sudicky 1991 turcke and kueper 1996 these values are based on k estimates obtained from laboratory permeameter data k estimates obtained from field pumping tests are expected to yield higher σ 2 lnk values due to the scale effects associated with observed responses as well as aquifer heterogeneities berg and illman 2011 for the relatively homogeneous borden aquifer a σ2 lnk value ranging from 1 to 2 from the ssle model is considered reasonable based on values reported for other field sites of varying heterogeneity sudicky et al 2010 zhao and illman 2018 as a result the σ2 lnk value of 1 6 generated from the ssht analysis is deemed to be a reasonable representation of the degree of heterogeneity for the entire model domain the variance associated with the k estimates is low 0 2 to 0 4 in fig 4 b which suggests confidence in the k estimates obtained from the ssle model the values in fig 4 b represent the variance for a single k estimate at the centroid of each element in the model domain with smaller values indicative of higher accuracy of the estimate yeh and liu 2000 the areas with the highest values of variance 0 35 correspond to the locations where no hydraulic head observations were available as discussed above indicating greater uncertainty in the k estimates across this portion of the domain this suggests that the k field is adequately captured near the ie wells but less information is available further from the pumping wells as expected since the focus of this study is on the characterization of the k field within the limits of the network of ie wells these results suggest that the hydraulic observations used in the inverse ssle model were sufficient to generate the k tomogram for the area of interest 2 4 calibration and validation of the k tomogram using ssle fig 5 shows the changes in simulated and observed steady state hydraulic head changes produced by the ssht and k eff scenarios these scatterplots show data that form three separate zones along the best fit line with a cluster of data near the origin 0 0 and data clusters near the upper and lower extremes of the hydraulic head changes corresponding to the active ie wells the two extreme data clusters at the ie wells show high statistical leverage as visually indicated by the distance of these isolated clusters from the main cluster near the origin and supported using the quantitative analysis presented by hoaglin and welsch 1978 it is recognized that data with high statistical leverage can have a strong influence on the regression results i e estimated slope and r 2 value chatterjee and hadi 1986 however the presence of these high leverage clusters is a direct product of the small spatial scale associated with the area of interest used in this study it is expected that the data would become more distributed along the 1 1 line as the separation distance between the ie wells was increased in the scatterplots associated with the model calibration data the slope of the best fit line associated for test g is 0 83 0 05 standard error and for test b is 1 14 0 08 fig 5 table 4 these slopes are not statistically different from unity at the 5 level of significance los these results suggest that the k tomogram is able to adequately reproduce the steady state observations of hydraulic heads during dipole pumping test g and test b which were used in the inverse model to estimate the k field the other scatterplots tests a c d e f and h in fig 5 represent model validation data and illustrate how well the k tomogram generated by the ssle model was able to predict changes in hydraulic head the simulated results produced by the ssht scenario were compared to those from the k eff scenario which indicate the ability of the bulk k estimate to capture the observations of hydraulic head changes during the independent dipole pumping tests the slopes of the best fit lines for these six scatterplots produced by the ssht scenario range from 0 81 0 05 to 1 06 0 09 table 4 for the k eff scenario the slopes of the best fit lines range from 0 70 0 04 to 0 99 0 11 across all eight scatterplots representing model validation data tests a to h table 4 with the exception of test h the slopes of the best fit line for the model validation data produced by the ssht scenario are not statistical different from unity los of 5 indicating that the hydraulic heads simulated using the k tomogram closely resemble those observed during the independent dipole pumping tests the exception in test h is presumably the consequence of the observed steady state hydraulic head changes at the extraction well being lower than those from the rest of the independent dipole pumping tests in contrast the slope of the best fit lines from the k eff scenario are statistically different from unity los of 5 for four of the eight independent dipole pumping tests i e tests c f g and h these results suggest that the k tomogram is better able to predict changes in the steady state hydraulic head than the bulk k estimate used in the effective parameter approach the l 1 norms produced by the ssht scenario are marginally lower than those determined using the k eff scenario across all the scatterplots associated with model validation with average l 1 norms of 0 033 m and 0 038 m respectively table 4 the l 2 norms however are the same for both scenarios 0 002 m2 collectively these results suggest that the k tomogram as a representation of the k distribution yields simulated steady state hydraulic head responses that are marginally superior to the hydraulic heads produced by the effective parameter approach compared to the observed hydraulic heads the difference in performance between the k tomogram and k eff is small because the borden aquifer is mildly heterogeneous larger differences have been observed at highly heterogeneous sites e g berg and illman 2011 zhao and illman 2018 2 5 transient flow simulations fig 6 shows a scatterplot of the changes in the simulated and observed transient hydraulic head changes produced by the ssht and k eff scenarios for all ie wells similar to the steady state simulation results the scatterplots associated with both scenarios show three distinct bands of data that are clustered together in horizontally elongated patterns the two outer bands show high statistical leverage chatterjee and hadi 1986 hoaglin and welsch 1978 and correspond to the hydraulic responses at the active ie wells while the central band is associated with the non pumping wells as in the independent dipole pumping test data fig 5 the presence of these bands is due to homogeneous nature of the aquifer and the small spatial scale of the rpm flow system used it is suspected that the horizontal elongated pattern observed in the outer bands is the result of the fluctuations in the hydraulic head observations due to 1 the dipoles that did not operate in the rpm flow sequence as expected i e fourth and fifth well pairs on fig 3 and the reversed order of sixth and seventh well pairs and 2 rainfall events that contributed to variations in the water table during the operation of the rpm flow system that were not simulated by the model the temporal changes in the simulated and observed hydraulic heads at ie 2 and ie 6 are illustrated in fig 7 see fig s5 for the other ie wells at ie 2 the observed hydraulic head changes show a slight decrease at 50 h while minor fluctuations are noted at ie 6 between 28 and 50 h that contribute to deviations from the amplitude of peak changes observed at other times in contrast the amplitude of the peak changes in the simulated hydraulic heads using the ssht and k eff scenarios remain constant the peak changes in the simulated hydraulic heads produced by the ssht scenario are greater than those from the k eff scenario which is a product of the k estimates that were higher than the expected range in the upper 0 4 m of the k tomogram fig 4 a the simulated hydraulic heads generated by the ssht scenario are able to reproduce the amplitude of the observed changes during injection at ie 2 t 50 h before the decrease in the observed hydraulic heads and during extraction at ie 6 for the entire simulation duration conversely the amplitude of the observed changes during injection at both of these ie wells are captured by the simulated hydraulic heads generated from the k eff scenario these results indicate that both the k tomogram and effective parameter approach as representations of the k field are able to capture the temporal changes in the hydraulic responses during the rpm flow protocol in total 1055 and 1051 data points were used to calculate the l 1 and l 2 norms and r values for the ssht and k eff scenarios respectively table 5 the difference in the number of data is due to the outliers that were removed based on the visual inspection of each scatterplot and statistical analyses of the best fit line the slopes of the best fit line on the scatterplots produced by the ssht and k eff scenarios were determined to be 1 20 0 02 and 0 75 0 01 respectively table 5 both slopes are not statistically different los of 5 from unity unfortunately the estimates of the l 1 and l 2 norms and r value table 5 demonstrate a conflicting set of results the l 1 norms of 0 093 and 0 076 m and the l 2 norms of 0 027 and 0 022 m2 for the ssht and k eff scenarios respectively suggest a slightly higher degree of error in the simulated hydraulic head values produced by the ssht scenario in contrast the ssht and k eff scenarios both yield a r value of 0 91 indicating a strong correlation between the simulated and observed values of hydraulic head the discrepancies in the trends observed between these estimates of the l 1 and l 2 norms and the r value is suspected to be the result of the high statistical leverage apparent in the data while it is recognized that data with high statistical leverage can have influence on the overall regression results chatterjee and hadi 1986 we note that these extreme data clusters are observed in the simulated hydraulic heads produced by both the ssht and k eff scenarios which strongly suggests this trend to be a product of the small spatial scale associated with the area of interest used in this study furthermore the presence of these extreme data clusters produced by the ssht and k eff scenarios implies that both best fit lines likely contain a similar degree of influence from the high leverage data points since the presence of statistical leverage is consistent to the data sets produced by both scenarios we can assume that the overall findings remain unaffected by this influence another potential reason for the slight underperformance of the ssht scenario was the use of steady state head data for inverse modeling the inverse modeling of transient head data i e transient hydraulic tomography tht could yield both k and s s tomograms which should yield improved predictions of transient heads the use of tht to further improve site characterization during rpm flows could be investigated in future studies these observations suggest that while the ssht analysis is capable of generating a k tomogram that produces simulated transient hydraulic head responses with good correlation to those observed during rpm flow the effective parameter approach also yields adequate predictions of hydraulic head responses other studies that have used ht analysis to delineate a k field were performed in moderately to highly heterogeneous aquifers with σ 2 lnk of 6 5 brauchler et al 2011 cardiff et al 2012 hochstetler et al 2016 paradis et al 2016 zhao and illman 2018 where the use of a k tomogram led to significantly improved predictions of hydraulic head in comparison to the effective parameter approach zhao and illman 2018 thus the apparent ability of both the k tomogram and effective parameter approach to predict the transient hydraulic head changes during the rpm flow protocol is the consequence of the relative homogeneous nature of this aquifer and the small spatial scale of the area of interest used in this study as the degree of k heterogeneity and spatial scale increase the k tomogram as the representation of the k distribution is expected to yield improved predictions of the hydraulic responses that more closely resemble those observed during an operation of the rpm flow system than the effective parameter approach 2 6 impact of the k tomogram on mixing to investigate the impact of using the k tomogram on the spatial distribution of a hypothetical reagent various combinations of rpm flow parameters reorientation angle θ pumping duration t p and flow rate q were assessed the theoretical parameter q reported by lester et al 2010 represents an estimate of the degree of mixing possible for a specific combination of q tp and q and was used to select the rpm flow parameters to be assessed the set of rpm flow parameters that produced q 0 05 represented by the green region on figure 2 a in lester et al 2010 were chosen for evaluation in this study during the design process the spatial distribution of particle trajectories was used as a criterion for the selection of rpm flow parameters particle tracking simulations were performed using both the k tomogram and effective parameter approach for an rpm flow protocol these particle trajectories were then compared visually and quantitatively using the cumulative travel distance based on observations from the comparison of particle trajectories produced by the ssht and k eff scenarios one or more rpm flow parameter was adjusted to assess whether a higher degree of reagent mixing was feasible this process was repeated until a specific set of rpm flow parameters generated the most enhanced spatial distribution of particle trajectories in all the combinations of rpm flow parameters explored the ssht scenario produced complex intersecting particle trajectories that are significantly more spatially distributed in the area of interest than the k eff scenario for illustration a typical simulation result showing the particle trajectories relative to their initial positions are presented in fig 8 for one set of rpm flow parameters θ 135 or 3π 4 t p 45 min q 4 m3 d d 1 75 m n 18 and t 5 days in the ssht scenario fig 8 a to d all particles move in a direction that corresponds to the reorientation angle used in the rpm flow protocol the initial direction of particle movement is governed by the location of the first dipole in the pumping schedule with a slight skew in the pathlines towards the first extraction well for a period of time t 0 5 days the particles travel within the limits of this initial trajectory which produces regions of denser pathline distributions near the center of the ie well network however with increased number of rpm flow cycles the particles eventually move away from this initial trajectory and produce enhanced spatial coverage in the x and y directions within the area of interest while the overall particle trajectories show a symmetry related to the relatively homogeneous k field of the borden aquifer fig 8 e the range of k values observed within the area of interest albeit small produces a distribution that is spatially complex and dense in the z direction the particles show an overall change of 2 5 cm from their initial positions but no intersection of particle trajectories are evident conversely in the k eff scenario fig 8 f all particles remain near their initial positions in the x y and z directions for the simulation duration t 5 days based on other peer reviewed studies that have identified reagent mixing as a consequence of the complex distribution of intersecting particle trajectories produced by chaotic advection lester et al 2009 metcalfe et al 2010 these results suggest that a greater degree of spreading and mixing of the reagent solution is achieved in the ssht scenario in comparison to the k eff scenario these qualitative observations of particle trajectories are supported by the average cumulative distance travelled by the particles the incremental change in travel distance during each time step ranges from 0 7 to 5 1 cm for the ssht scenario and from 0 3 to 2 0 cm for the k eff scenario after a simulation period of 5 days 18 complete cycles of rpm flow n 18 the average distance travelled by all particles increases linearly towards a cumulative value of 30 39 0 41 m and 13 92 0 13 m for the ssht and k eff scenarios respectively a comparison of the cumulative travel distances from both scenarios indicate that the particle trajectories produced by the ssht scenario have longer travel distances and thus provide a greater spatial coverage within the area of interest indicative of enhanced reagent mixing this finding is consistent with other peer reviewed studies that also used particle tracking methods and demonstrated that reagent mixing is significantly enhanced when chaotic advection is used a heterogeneous k setting trefry et al 2012 neupauer et al 2014 since heterogeneities in the k field typically lead to variations in the velocity field and contribute to enhanced reagent mixing kitanidis and mccarty 2012 it is expected that for the same k field an rpm flow system would produce an even greater degree of reagent spreading and mixing than by natural processes advection and diffusion alone as the degree of k heterogeneity increases in the area of interest the particle trajectories are expected to be more complex and asymmetric these particle tracking results demonstrate that for the same set of rpm flow parameters the use of the k tomogram leads to significantly enhanced distribution and intersection of particle trajectories in all directions within the area of interest while both the ssht and k eff scenarios produced estimates of hydraulic head changes that resemble those observed during the operation of the rpm flow system the particle tracking results suggest that the improved representation of the variability in the k field has important implications on the mixing behavior of a reagent the improved spatial distribution of particle trajectories indicates that using k information applicable to a specific area of interest leads to an effective design of an rpm flow system that can enhance reagent mixing 3 conclusions the results demonstrate that the k tomogram determined from the inversion of hydraulic head observations during two independent dipole pumping tests yields simulated estimates of steady state and transient hydraulic heads that show good correlation to those observed in the area of interest as defined by the limits of the circular array of ie wells for the small spatial scale investigated in this relatively homogeneous aquifer the effective parameter approach was comparable to the k tomogram in its ability to simulate changes in hydraulic head that are representative of those observed while the flow simulations produced a similar range of hydraulic heads using both the k tomogram and effective parameter approach as representations of the k field the particle tracking results showed that incorporating the k tomogram significantly enhanced the spatial distribution of particle trajectories within the area of interest the use of the k tomogram generated more spatially and densely distributed particle trajectories indicative of enhanced reagent mixing than those produced by the effective parameter approach in which all particles showed minimal change from their initial positions for the entire simulation duration the findings from this study demonstrate that the same well system used to invoke chaotic advection can also be used in a ht analysis providing a viable site characterization tool to delineate the spatial variability of k in the area of interest in addition using k information applicable to a specific area of interest in a groundwater flow model with a particle tracking engine provides a tool that can be used for the design of an effective rpm flow system to promote enhanced reagent mixing while this proof of concept study presents supportive modeling tools for the characterization of the k field and the design of an effective rpm flow system potential limitations of the relative homogeneous nature of the aquifer and the small spatial scale of the area of interest were noted for improved robustness of these modeling tools this study should be extended to a larger area of interest at other field sites of varying degree of heterogeneity where the use of an rpm flow system is anticipated for the generation of chaotic advection to promote enhanced reagent mixing acknowledgements financial support for this investigation

1536,the concept of chaotic advection is a novel approach that has the potential to overcome some of the challenges associated with mixing of reagents that commonly occur when injection based in situ treatment techniques are used the rotated potential mixing rpm flow system is one configuration which has been theorized to achieve chaotic advection in porous media and enhance reagent mixing by periodically re oriented dipole pumping at a series of radial wells prior to field implementation of chaotic advection the selection of an rpm flow protocol will likely require a numerical model that can adequately represent groundwater flow within the zone of interest as expected the hydraulic conductivity k field is the most critical input requirement for the selected groundwater flow model hydraulic tomography ht is an innovative characterization approach that has shown potential to provide information on a k field in this investigation we explored whether the same well system required to invoke chaotic advection can also be applied in a ht analysis and evaluated the use of the generated k tomogram for the selection of rpm flow parameters that can enhance reagent mixing a series of dipole pumping tests were conducted within an area of interest as defined by the limits of the circular network of eight injection extraction wells used to invoke chaotic advection hydraulic head data collected from independent dipole pumping tests were used in an inverse model to perform steady state hydraulic tomography ssht analysis to generate a k tomogram both the k tomogram and an effective parameter approach i e a single k value assigned across the entire spatial domain as determined by single well pumping and slug tests produced estimates of hydraulic head that closely resembled those observed due to the relative homogeneous nature of the aquifer and the small spatial scale of the area of interest in contrast particle tracking results showed that incorporating a heterogeneous k field significantly enhanced the spatial distribution of particle trajectories indicative of reagent mixing these findings support the hypothesis that the same well system used to invoke chaotic advection can be combined with ssht analysis as a viable site characterization tool for delineating the spatial variability of k incorporating this k tomogram in a groundwater flow model with a particle tracking engine can be used as a design tool to aid in the selection of a site specific rpm flow protocol to achieve enhanced reagent mixing keywords chaotic advection groundwater in situ remediation hydraulic tomography subsurface heterogeneity rpm flow 1 introduction in situ treatment commonly involves the injection of a reagent into the subsurface to create a zone in which biological and or chemical reactions lead to the mass destruction of contaminants e g enhanced biodegradation chemical oxidation reduction in these injection driven remedial systems the delivery of reagent solutions is a key requirement for success following the injection of a reagent solution the reagent and contaminant must come in contact in the subsurface for the desired biological or chemical reactions to occur kitanidis and mccarty 2012 this contact between the injected reagent and contaminant is the desired outcome of an effective delivery system however it is often hindered by subsurface heterogeneities that create preferential flow pathways at a range of spatial scales dagan 1986 scheibe and yabusaki 1998 which leads to a non uniform distribution of the injected reagent for conventional injection methods that use vertical wells the injected reagent distribution will be greater in areas of higher hydraulic conductivity k payne et al 2008 as the fluid follows the path of least resistance from the wellbore into the porous medium depending on the k contrast perhaps due to the presence of small scale structures in sedimentary deposits e g bedding planes laminations fractures etc the injected reagent may bypass adjacent regions of lower k saenton et al 2002 dagan and neuman 2005 zhong et al 2011 in these lower k zones molecular diffusion d 10 9 m2 s is the primary transport mechanism responsible to bring the injected reagent and contaminant together jose and cirpka 2004 gale et al 2015 however diffusion is a slow process which contributes to inefficient mixing kitanidis and mccarty 2012 ineffective mixing can lead to partial removal of the contaminant mass in a source zone which results in eventual rebound of contaminant levels and long term persistence of plumes thomson et al 2008 contributing to lengthy remediation timelines kitanidis and mccarty 2012 the concept of chaotic advection trefry et al 2012 aref et al 2017 has the potential to overcome some of these challenges associated with mixing and improve reagent distribution in the subsurface chaotic advection has been defined as the creation of small scale structures resulting from the repeated stretching and folding of fluid elements in a laminar flow regime ottino 1989 aref et al 2017 this stretching and folding of individual fluid parcels yields highly complex intersecting particle trajectories which has been theorized to enhance the spatial distribution of solutes in porous media and increase the zone of contact across which reactions can occur ottino 1989 bagtzoglou and oates 2007 lester et al 2009 mays and neupauer 2012 the small scale structures act to stir the fluid to elements at length scales small enough for diffusion to contribute to efficient mixing aref et al 2017 one configuration which has been theoretically and experimentally used to achieve chaotic advection in porous media involves periodically re oriented dipole flow through the transient switching of pressures at a series of radial wells this configuration has been termed rotated potential mixing rpm flow in the relevant literature metcalfe et al 2008 and assumes a completely closed system where the fluid removed from the extraction well is immediately re injected at the injection well trefry et al 2012 in an rpm flow protocol a dipole consisting of one injection and one extraction well separated by 180 operates for a fixed time t p this dipole is then instantaneously re oriented by a specified reorientation angle θ and resumes pumping for t p a repeated sequence of this periodically re oriented dipole pumping will eventually produce chaos in the flow regime corresponding to complex particle trajectories lester et al 2009 metcalfe et al 2010 in an rpm flow system the reorientation angle θ pumping duration t p and flow rate q have been identified as key parameters metcalfe et al 2010 the selection of rpm flow parameters t p θ and q is critical for successful implementation of chaotic advection in the field lester et al 2010 trefry et al 2012 determination of an rpm flow protocol will likely require a numerical model that can adequately represent groundwater flow within an aquifer undergoing periodically re oriented dipole pumping it is expected that the k field will be the critical data requirement for the groundwater flow model it is widely accepted that accurate estimation of the k field can have significant implications for groundwater flow contaminant transport and hence on the design of an effective remediation system to achieve the desired treatment outcomes illman et al 2008 berg and illman 2013 traditional k characterization methods i e pumping tests yield effective parameters which are averaged over a large volume and are representative only of bulk flow behavior brauchler et al 2011 other k characterization methods like slug tests yield a single k estimate for a small aquifer volume in the immediate vicinity of the piezometer freeze and cherry 1979 using geostatistical interpolation to obtain a spatial distribution of k requires a large number of small scale k measurements from cores or slug tests which is both expensive and time consuming yeh and liu 2000 liu et al 2007 berg and illman 2013 for instance sudicky 1986 obtained over 1279 k estimates from falling head permeameter tests on core samples to delineate the spatial variability of a k field in contrast hydraulic tomography ht is a novel characterization approach that has shown potential to provide information on a k field ht involves pumping or injecting water into a well monitoring the aquifer response at nearby well locations and then repeatedly switching the pumping or injection locations yeh and liu 2000 zhu and yeh 2005 the drawdown responses collected from a ht survey are subsequently used in an inverse model to generate an image of the k distribution i e k tomogram transient hydraulic tomography tht yields a tomogram of both k and specific storage s s both steady state and transient ht have been used to characterize aquifer heterogeneities in laboratory scale sandbox experiments and in the field liu et al 2007 illman et al 2007 berg and illman 2011 berg and illman 2013 zhao and illman 2018 zha et al 2019 results from these studies indicate that use of k tomograms lead to considerably improved prediction of aquifer responses during a pumping test forward simulations using k tomograms as the representation of the k field consistently showed the highest correlation between simulated and observed drawdown in comparison to the effective parameter approach i e a single k value assigned across the entire spatial domain and other methods e g k fields from interpolation of small scale measurements in this paper we propose that the well system required to invoke chaotic advection can also be applied in a ht analysis and explore whether subsequent use of this k tomogram in a groundwater flow model can aid in the design of an rpm flow system the specific objectives were to assess whether hydraulic head responses from multiple independent dipole pumping tests can be used in three dimensional 3d steady state hydraulic tomography ssht analysis to capture k heterogeneities and then to investigate the impact of using this k tomogram on the selection of an rpm flow protocol and the spatial distribution of a hypothetical reagent the findings from this investigation are significant since the ability to use the same well system to invoke chaotic advection as that used as a site characterization tool to delineate k variability would be advantageous using k information applicable to a specific target treatment zone would allow for improved design of a chaotic advection system which would ultimately lead to enhanced treatment effectiveness 1 1 hydraulic tomography ht survey the ht survey was performed in an experimental gate located in the sandpit at the university of waterloo research aquifer facility at canadian forces base cfb in borden ontario the gate was 8 m wide by 11 m long and hydraulically isolated on two sides by hanging sheet pilings driven down to 2 m below ground surface bgs the other two sides had 2 5 m wide openings in the center that allowed groundwater to flow through the cell controlled by the regional horizontal hydraulic gradient in the upper 2 m of the aquifer the unconfined borden aquifer at this location is composed primarily of unconsolidated fine to medium grained well sorted sand porosity of 0 33 that extends 9 m in thickness and underlain by a clayey and sandy silt aquitard some microscale heterogeneities are present in the form of silty sand and coarse sand lenses the water table varies seasonally but is typically located at 0 6 m bgs mackay et al 1986 sudicky 1986 the specific storage is reported to range from 3 3 10 5 to 1 0 10 3 m 1 moench 2008 frind et al 1999 previous analysis of soil cores collected from cfb borden reported a range of horizontal k from 6 0 10 6 to 2 0 10 4 m s with a geometric mean of 6 8 10 5 m s geostatistical analyses of the k estimates from the core samples indicated that the average horizontal and vertical correlation lengths and variance of lnk σ2 lnk are 4 75 m 0 2 m and 0 2 respectively sudicky 1986 woodbury and sudicky 1991 rivett et al 1994 turcke and kueper 1996 tomlinson et al 2003 the vertical hydraulic conductivity is estimated to be approximately one third of the horizontal mackay et al 1986 sudicky 1986 within the gate eight 8 injection extraction wells identified as ie 1 to ie 8 were installed in a circular network with an approximate diameter of 1 75 m fig 1 around a center injection well iw all boreholes were advanced using a direct push method geoprobe 7720dt to a depth of 2 m bgs while the casing was pulled back to surface the aquifer material was allowed to collapse around the 5 1 cm diameter well schedule 40 pvc each ie well and the iw was screened 2 5 mm slot from 0 75 to 1 75 m bgs all wells were developed after installation eight 8 single well pumping tests and a series of slug tests a total of six 6 falling and rising head tests were performed at each ie well to obtain estimates of k the single well pumping tests were performed using a peristaltic pump cole parmer masterflex 7549 32 with masterflex 7019 43 pump head with a flow rate of 3 l min for 35 to 40 min until apparent steady state conditions were established i e when insignificant changes were observed in the hydraulic heads at all ie well locations once the pumping test was finished a recovery period 20 to 30 min was implemented to allow water levels to return to baseline conditions prior to the start of the next test slug

solenoid valves are one directional and unable to withstand backpressure from pumping dedicated pvc tubing was attached to the respective solenoid valve pair and placed in each ie well the end of each pvc tubing 10 cm in length was prepared with 3 9 mm holes and wrapped with 125 μm nitex screen the ht survey consisted of two data collection stages during stage 1 a series of independent dipole pumping tests were conducted using the eight ie wells see table 1 for the well pairs involved in each test and the above ground injection extraction system fig s1 each pumping test involved only one active dipole one injection and one extraction well with all other wells inactive the independent dipole pumping tests were performed using a high q 3 l min and a low q 1 8 l min flow rate each test was run until apparent steady state conditions were established as indicated by insignificant changes in the observed hydraulic heads at all ie well locations after each independent dipole pumping test a rest period 15 min was implemented to allow sufficient time for the hydraulic head changes resulting from the pumping to return to baseline conditions steady state observations of hydraulic heads from select independent dipole pumping tests were then used in the inverse model to generate a k tomogram the remainder of the dipole pumping tests not used in the ssht analysis were compared to the simulated predictions of steady state hydraulic heads for validation of the k tomogram during stage 2 a complete rpm flow protocol was implemented using the dipole pumping system where each ie well pair was operated for t p 1 h at q rpm 1 8 l min after duration t p the active dipole was turned off i e valves closed and re oriented by the reorientation angle θ 45 before pumping resumed at the new dipole using the same t p and q rpm this periodically re oriented dipole pumping was repeated around the ie well network for 6 days i e 18 complete rpm cycles n 18 observations of transient hydraulic heads collected during the implementation of this rpm flow protocol were compared to simulated hydraulic heads for validation of the k tomogram a submersible datalogger ctd diver van essen

modeling approach hydraulic head data collected from select independent dipole pumping tests were used in an inverse model to perform ssht analysis to generate an estimate of the k field i e k tomogram to assess the impact of using this k tomogram in a three dimensional 3d groundwater flow model simulated steady state hydraulic heads were compared to those observed during the independent dipole pumping tests a 3d transient groundwater flow model was also developed and used to simulate the hydraulic response of the borden aquifer during an rpm flow protocol this 3d transient model was subsequently extended to include particle tracking and used to investigate the impact of this k tomogram on the spatial distribution of particle trajectories in a target treatment zone as an indicator of reagent mixing for validation of the estimated k field all forward simulations were performed using the k tomogram ssht scenario determined from the inversion of steady state hydraulic head observations during the independent dipole pumping tests and compared to the effective parameter approach k eff scenario in which a single value of k was assigned across the entire spatial domain as the representation of the k field 1 3 steady state hydraulic tomography ssht analysis of multiple dipole pumping tests 1 3 1 inverse modeling method the ssht analysis of independent dipole pumping tests was performed using the sequential successive linear estimator ssle model developed by yeh and liu 2000 all inverse simulations were completed using a finite element mesh 8 m by 11 m by 9 m fig s2 which consisted of rectangular elements variable in size in the central portion of the model domain where all field tests were conducted 0 25 m by 0 25 m by 0 25 m size elements were used outside this central portion the element size was increased to 0 5 m by 0 5 m in the x and y directions in the z direction where z 0 coincides with the underlying aquitard one element was assigned from 0 to 6 5 m and 10 elements δz 0 25 m from 6 5 to 9 m corresponding to the depth of the sheet pilings 0 to 2 m bgs in total the model domain consisted of 6776 elements 28 22 11 and 8004 nodes 29 23 12 the bottom and portions of the model domain that correspond to the location and depth of the sheet pilings were assigned no flow boundary conditions along all other boundaries a constant head boundary condition was employed and assigned a value of 9 m during the ht survey the water table was near ground surface and thus we assumed that the domain was fully saturated additional input parameters specified were initial estimates of k as well as geostatistical parameters correlation lengths λ x λ y λ z and variance see table 2 the specification of correlation lengths allows mapping of heterogeneity in the vertical direction despite all wells being screened over the same depth interval pumping wells were assigned as source sink terms in the elements corresponding to the location of ie well pair involved in each dipole pumping test with estimated flow rates from the field hydraulic head responses were selected from the steady state portion of the change in hydraulic head profiles associated with each independent dipole pumping test convergence criteria were considered to be met when either the change in the estimated k field was below a minimum threshold i e variance between iterations 0 001 or the maximum number iterations n 500 was achieved 1 3 2 calibration and validation of k tomogram using the ssle to assess whether the use of the k tomogram leads to improved predictions of hydraulic head responses during an independent dipole pumping test 3d simulations of steady state groundwater flow were performed using the ssle model with the k tomogram as the representation of the k distribution these steady state simulation results using the k tomogram were then compared to those generated by the effective parameter approach in which a single value of k as determined by the single well pumping and slug tests was assigned across the entire spatial domain scatterplots were used to illustrate the relationship between simulated and observed values of hydraulic head changes model calibration was examined by incorporating the k tomogram in the 3d forward ssle model to simulate the steady state hydraulic responses during the independent dipole pumping tests used in the inversion process these calibration simulations examine how well the computed k tomogram was able to reproduce the observations of hydraulic head used in the inverse model for model validation predictions of steady state hydraulic head were generated using the 3d forward ssle model for the independent dipole pumping tests not used in the ssht analysis illman et al 2007 berg and illman 2013 for each scatterplot the best fit line consisting of the slope intercept and coefficient of determination r 2 was estimated and compared to the 1 1 line which represents a perfect match between the simulated and observed values of hydraulic head changes a strong correlation between the simulated and observed hydraulic head changes would lead to points scattering along the 1 1 line to further assess how well the change in simulated values of hydraulic head compare to the observed the mean absolute error norm l 1 and mean square error norm l 2 associated with each scatterplot were calculated for the independent pumping tests xiang et al 1992 berg and illman 2013 1 l 1 m 1 n i 1 n χ i χ i 2 l 2 m 2 1 n i 1 n χ i χ i 2 where n is the number of hydraulic head observations and χ i and χ i are simulated and observed change in hydraulic head meters respectively the l 1 and l 2 norms are useful model performance metrics with smaller values of l 1 and l 2 norms indicative of simulated estimates of hydraulic head changes that are closer to the observed illman et al 2007 berg and illman 2015 while the l 1 norm is a useful indicator of the overall model performance the l 2 norm gives more weight to larger differences leading to detection of potential outliers xiang et al 1992 1 4 3d transient flow simulations simulations were performed using a 3d transient groundwater flow model to investigate the impact of using the k tomogram as the representation of the k field on predictions of hydraulic heads and on the spatial distribution of particle trajectories during repeated cycles of rpm flow the development of a numerical model that can represent groundwater flow during periodically re oriented dipole pumping is a critical step towards the design of an effective rpm flow system the 3d transient simulations were performed using the modflow 2005 and modpath engines in visual modflow flex version 2015 1 waterloo hydrogeologic kitchener ontario canada the dimensions of the domain as well as boundary conditions used for these transient simulations were the same as those used in ssle model however this domain was discretized with the smallest grid blocks 0 05 m by 0 05 m by 0 05 m in the central portion of the domain where all field tests were conducted a smaller discretization was selected for this model domain to adequately represent the complexities in the flow fields produced by the transient rpm flow system outside this central portion the grid blocks were increased to 0 1 m by 0 1 m in the x and y directions in the z direction one block was assigned from 0 to 6 5 m and 50 blocks δz 0 05 m from 6 5 to 9 m in total the finite difference grid was composed of 110 rows 140 columns and 51 layers fig s3 pumping wells were assigned to the appropriate layers of the model grid with a time dependent schedule that corresponds to the ie well pair involved in the rpm flow protocol cumulative volumes obtained from flow meter data were used to estimate the average flow rate for each dipole i e q rpm 1 2 to 2 4 l min and q rpm 1 8 l min across all dipoles a value of 0 26 was used for the specific yield s y to represent this shallow unconfined aquifer system and the effective porosity was assumed to be 0 33 mackay et al 1986 the k tomogram generated from the ssht analysis was imported into visual modflow flex and assigned as an interpolated surface to the corresponding layer of the finite difference grid for the k eff scenario the same k value used in the steady state ssle model was assumed for the entire model domain the conjugate gradient solver cgs was used in the modflow engine with a convergence criterion of 10 7 m a scatterplot was used to show the relationship between simulated values of hydraulic head and those observed during rpm flow and to determine a best fit regression line in addition to the l 1 and l 2 norms the correlation coefficient r was determined for the transient simulation results produced by both the ssht and k eff scenarios using mccuen and snyder 1986 liu et al 2007 3 r 1 n i 1 n χ i μ χ χ i μ χ 1 n i 1 n χ i μ χ 2 1 n i 1 n χ i μ χ 2 where n is the number of hydraulic head observations χ i and χ i are simulated and observed values of hydraulic head changes at a given time respectively and μ χ and μ χ are the corresponding means of the simulated and observed hydraulic head changes respectively the r value is a quantitative metric that indicates the strength of correlation between observed and simulated values with higher values of r 1 representing stronger correlation between the two data sets mccuen and snyder 1986 liu et al 2007 to investigate the consequence of using the k tomogram on the selection of an rpm flow protocol and the spatial distribution of a hypothetical reagent injected from the iw fig 1 the 3d transient groundwater flow model was extended to include particle tracking using the modpath engine these particle tracking simulations represent a reagent solution previously injected at the center of the circular ie well network that is subsequently mixed by an rpm flow system for this investigation 48 particles were assigned in the cells immediately adjacent to the center of the circular network of the ie wells at a depth that corresponds to the midpoint of the well screens these initial particle positions are indicative of the approximate location of the hypothetical injected reagent solution all particles were treated as forward tracking particles various combinations of rpm flow parameters reorientation angle θ and pumping duration t p were assessed for their ability to produce an enhanced spatial distribution of particle trajectories and thus an increase in the cumulative travel distance within the area of interest as defined by the limits of the ie wells to represent a target treatment zone using the spatial distribution of particle trajectories as an indicator of reagent mixing and as a criterion for the selection of rpm flow parameters supports the theory that chaotic advection results from the stretching and folding of fluid elements which produce highly complex intersecting particle trajectories that can lead to enhanced reagent mixing ottino 1989 lester et al 2009 2 results and discussion 2 1 effective hydraulic conductivity to determine k estimates in the area of interest by traditional characterization methods the data collected from the single well pumping and slug tests were analyzed using aquifertest waterloo hydrogeologic kitchener ontario canada table 3 the k estimate ranges from 5 3 10 5 to 7 6 10 5 m s based on the single well pumping test data and from 4 1 10 5 to 7 1 10 5 m s using the slug test data the k estimates from the single well pumping tests are slightly higher than those produced by the slug tests presumably due to the larger spatial scale captured by the test overall the data from both tests yield a similar range of k estimates with a geometric mean of 6 3 10 5 m s for the single well pumping tests and 5 4 10 5 m s for the slug tests since this difference is small the horizontal k eff value in the area of interest was assumed to be the combined geometric mean of 5 8 10 5 m s i e k xx k yy the vertical hydraulic conductivity k z was assumed to be one third of this value to be consistent with previous findings for the borden aquifer mackay et al 1986 sudicky 1986 this k eff value is within the typical range reported for the borden aquifer i e 6 0 10 6 to 2 0 10 4 m s and is consistent with the geometric mean 6 8 10 5 m s of the k estimates reported in other studies using soil cores from this site sudicky 1986 woodbury and sudicky 1991 rivett et al 1994 turcke and kueper 1996 collectively these results indicate that the k eff value determined from the single well pumping and slug test data is a reasonable assumption for the k value used in the effective parameter approach 2 2 hydraulic responses fig 2 shows the observed hydraulic head changes relative to baseline conditions for all ie wells for two of the eight independent dipole pumping tests conducted at the high flow rate q 3 1 1 l min see fig s4 for the other test results only the hydraulic head observations from the dipole pumping tests performed at the high flow rate were used in the ssht analysis based on the previous work of illman et al 2008 who demonstrated that increased pumping rates yield higher signal to noise ratios in the data collected from a ht survey and lead to improved predictions of the k field a positive hydraulic head change implies that water was being injected into the well while a negative hydraulic head change implies that water was being extracted from the well steady state conditions appear to be established within 2 min of pumping at each ie well with steady state hydraulic head changes ranging from 29 to 49 cm during injection and from 48 to 25 cm during extraction fig 2 hydraulic head changes are evident at the wells located 0 7 m on either side of the injection extraction wells with hydraulic heads approximately an order of magnitude less than those observed at the active dipoles minor fluctuations in hydraulic head 0 5 cm are observed at wells furthest away from the active ie wells fig 3 shows the observed hydraulic head changes relative to baseline conditions at all ie wells during rpm flow fig 3 a shows the change in hydraulic heads over the entire duration of the test when rpm flows are active n 18 t total 6 days while fig 3 b shows the response to dipole pumping for the first 8 h of the test n 1 despite some fluctuations the dipole system operated as expected with one ie well pair pumping for one hour before switching to the next pair the frequency of the peak hydraulic head changes corresponds to the switching time t p of 1 h associated with the dipole pumping system with peak hydraulic head changes ranging from 18 to 72 cm during injection and 57 to 18 cm during extraction as expected the hydraulic head changes during extraction are less than those observed during injection for shallow wells in an unconfined aquifer freeze and cherry 1979 the suppressed amplitudes relative to the other ie wells during the fourth ie 4 and ie 8 and fifth ie 1 and ie 5 dipoles in the rpm flow pumping sequence fig 3 b is suspected to be the result of poor connection contact between the solenoid valve wiring and the plc unit that failed to provide the electrical signal required to open the valve and permit flow 2 3 visual assessment of the k tomogram sixteen 16 steady state observations of hydraulic head from two different dipole pumping tests test g and test b were used sequentially in the ssht analysis the specific number and order of dipole pumping tests used in the inversion process were determined based on the combination of tests that produced a k tomogram within the range of k values observed from the single well pumping and slug tests in the area of interest previous work has shown that both the number and order of observations used in the inversion process are critical considerations in ht analysis as they impact the quality of the resulting k tomogram illman et al 2008 berg and illman 2011 the final k tomogram for the domain depth corresponding to the sheet pilings i e 0 to 2 m bgs and associated variance are shown in fig 4 the upper 0 4 m of the domain red regions of the k tomogram in fig 4 a shows k estimates that are higher than those observed from the single well pumping and slug tests in the area of interest table 3 however this depth is above the well screen where no hydraulic head observations were available and thus is expected to produce greater uncertainty in the k estimates elsewhere in the area of interest the k estimates are within the observed range i e 4 1 10 5 to 7 6 10 5 m s the mean k within the area of interest from the k tomogram is 4 1 10 5 m s which is slightly lower than the k eff value 5 8 10 5 m s and near the lower limit of the observed k range based on the single well pumping and slug test data the slight difference between these two mean k values is likely related to the spatial scale associated with each estimation method the k tomogram provides a representation of the k distribution across the entire zone of interest and captures vertical k variability whereas the estimate from the single well pumping and slug test data yield a bulk estimate of k the final k tomogram fig 4 a shows elongated zones of primarily horizontal parallel layering that span across 6 m in the x and y directions without interruptions by lower k features horizons variability in the z direction is observed with k estimates that range within an order of magnitude across layers 0 25 m in thickness these observations are consistent with previous efforts that have described the borden aquifer as relatively homogeneous with horizontal and vertical correlation lengths of 4 75 m and 0 2 m respectively sudicky 1986 woodbury and sudicky 1991 rivett et al 1994 turcke and kueper 1996 tomlinson et al 2003 furthermore the sequential inversion of the dipole pumping tests produced a k field with a variance of ln k σ 2 lnk of 1 6 for the entire model domain this value is determined by the ssle model as a variance of the k estimates assigned to each of the elements in the modeling domain i e 6776 estimates in total and represents the overall degree of heterogeneity yeh and liu 2000 while σ 2 lnk values typically reported for the borden aquifer range from 0 3 to 0 6 woodbury and sudicky 1991 turcke and kueper 1996 these values are based on k estimates obtained from laboratory permeameter data k estimates obtained from field pumping tests are expected to yield higher σ 2 lnk values due to the scale effects associated with observed responses as well as aquifer heterogeneities berg and illman 2011 for the relatively homogeneous borden aquifer a σ2 lnk value ranging from 1 to 2 from the ssle model is considered reasonable based on values reported for other field sites of varying heterogeneity sudicky et al 2010 zhao and illman 2018 as a result the σ2 lnk value of 1 6 generated from the ssht analysis is deemed to be a reasonable representation of the degree of heterogeneity for the entire model domain the variance associated with the k estimates is low 0 2 to 0 4 in fig 4 b which suggests confidence in the k estimates obtained from the ssle model the values in fig 4 b represent the variance for a single k estimate at the centroid of each element in the model domain with smaller values indicative of higher accuracy of the estimate yeh and liu 2000 the areas with the highest values of variance 0 35 correspond to the locations where no hydraulic head observations were available as discussed above indicating greater uncertainty in the k estimates across this portion of the domain this suggests that the k field is adequately captured near the ie wells but less information is available further from the pumping wells as expected since the focus of this study is on the characterization of the k field within the limits of the network of ie wells these results suggest that the hydraulic observations used in the inverse ssle model were sufficient to generate the k tomogram for the area of interest 2 4 calibration and validation of the k tomogram using ssle fig 5 shows the changes in simulated and observed steady state hydraulic head changes produced by the ssht and k eff scenarios these scatterplots show data that form three separate zones along the best fit line with a cluster of data near the origin 0 0 and data clusters near the upper and lower extremes of the hydraulic head changes corresponding to the active ie wells the two extreme data clusters at the ie wells show high statistical leverage as visually indicated by the distance of these isolated clusters from the main cluster near the origin and supported using the quantitative analysis presented by hoaglin and welsch 1978 it is recognized that data with high statistical leverage can have a strong influence on the regression results i e estimated slope and r 2 value chatterjee and hadi 1986 however the presence of these high leverage clusters is a direct product of the small spatial scale associated with the area of interest used in this study it is expected that the data would become more distributed along the 1 1 line as the separation distance between the ie wells was increased in the scatterplots associated with the model calibration data the slope of the best fit line associated for test g is 0 83 0 05 standard error and for test b is 1 14 0 08 fig 5 table 4 these slopes are not statistically different from unity at the 5 level of significance los these results suggest that the k tomogram is able to adequately reproduce the steady state observations of hydraulic heads during dipole pumping test g and test b which were used in the inverse model to estimate the k field the other scatterplots tests a c d e f and h in fig 5 represent model validation data and illustrate how well the k tomogram generated by the ssle model was able to predict changes in hydraulic head the simulated results produced by the ssht scenario were compared to those from the k eff scenario which indicate the ability of the bulk k estimate to capture the observations of hydraulic head changes during the independent dipole pumping tests the slopes of the best fit lines for these six scatterplots produced by the ssht scenario range from 0 81 0 05 to 1 06 0 09 table 4 for the k eff scenario the slopes of the best fit lines range from 0 70 0 04 to 0 99 0 11 across all eight scatterplots representing model validation data tests a to h table 4 with the exception of test h the slopes of the best fit line for the model validation data produced by the ssht scenario are not statistical different from unity los of 5 indicating that the hydraulic heads simulated using the k tomogram closely resemble those observed during the independent dipole pumping tests the exception in test h is presumably the consequence of the observed steady state hydraulic head changes at the extraction well being lower than those from the rest of the independent dipole pumping tests in contrast the slope of the best fit lines from the k eff scenario are statistically different from unity los of 5 for four of the eight independent dipole pumping tests i e tests c f g and h these results suggest that the k tomogram is better able to predict changes in the steady state hydraulic head than the bulk k estimate used in the effective parameter approach the l 1 norms produced by the ssht scenario are marginally lower than those determined using the k eff scenario across all the scatterplots associated with model validation with average l 1 norms of 0 033 m and 0 038 m respectively table 4 the l 2 norms however are the same for both scenarios 0 002 m2 collectively these results suggest that the k tomogram as a representation of the k distribution yields simulated steady state hydraulic head responses that are marginally superior to the hydraulic heads produced by the effective parameter approach compared to the observed hydraulic heads the difference in performance between the k tomogram and k eff is small because the borden aquifer is mildly heterogeneous larger differences have been observed at highly heterogeneous sites e g berg and illman 2011 zhao and illman 2018 2 5 transient flow simulations fig 6 shows a scatterplot of the changes in the simulated and observed transient hydraulic head changes produced by the ssht and k eff scenarios for all ie wells similar to the steady state simulation results the scatterplots associated with both scenarios show three distinct bands of data that are clustered together in horizontally elongated patterns the two outer bands show high statistical leverage chatterjee and hadi 1986 hoaglin and welsch 1978 and correspond to the hydraulic responses at the active ie wells while the central band is associated with the non pumping wells as in the independent dipole pumping test data fig 5 the presence of these bands is due to homogeneous nature of the aquifer and the small spatial scale of the rpm flow system used it is suspected that the horizontal elongated pattern observed in the outer bands is the result of the fluctuations in the hydraulic head observations due to 1 the dipoles that did not operate in the rpm flow sequence as expected i e fourth and fifth well pairs on fig 3 and the reversed order of sixth and seventh well pairs and 2 rainfall events that contributed to variations in the water table during the operation of the rpm flow system that were not simulated by the model the temporal changes in the simulated and observed hydraulic heads at ie 2 and ie 6 are illustrated in fig 7 see fig s5 for the other ie wells at ie 2 the observed hydraulic head changes show a slight decrease at 50 h while minor fluctuations are noted at ie 6 between 28 and 50 h that contribute to deviations from the amplitude of peak changes observed at other times in contrast the amplitude of the peak changes in the simulated hydraulic heads using the ssht and k eff scenarios remain constant the peak changes in the simulated hydraulic heads produced by the ssht scenario are greater than those from the k eff scenario which is a product of the k estimates that were higher than the expected range in the upper 0 4 m of the k tomogram fig 4 a the simulated hydraulic heads generated by the ssht scenario are able to reproduce the amplitude of the observed changes during injection at ie 2 t 50 h before the decrease in the observed hydraulic heads and during extraction at ie 6 for the entire simulation duration conversely the amplitude of the observed changes during injection at both of these ie wells are captured by the simulated hydraulic heads generated from the k eff scenario these results indicate that both the k tomogram and effective parameter approach as representations of the k field are able to capture the temporal changes in the hydraulic responses during the rpm flow protocol in total 1055 and 1051 data points were used to calculate the l 1 and l 2 norms and r values for the ssht and k eff scenarios respectively table 5 the difference in the number of data is due to the outliers that were removed based on the visual inspection of each scatterplot and statistical analyses of the best fit line the slopes of the best fit line on the scatterplots produced by the ssht and k eff scenarios were determined to be 1 20 0 02 and 0 75 0 01 respectively table 5 both slopes are not statistically different los of 5 from unity unfortunately the estimates of the l 1 and l 2 norms and r value table 5 demonstrate a conflicting set of results the l 1 norms of 0 093 and 0 076 m and the l 2 norms of 0 027 and 0 022 m2 for the ssht and k eff scenarios respectively suggest a slightly higher degree of error in the simulated hydraulic head values produced by the ssht scenario in contrast the ssht and k eff scenarios both yield a r value of 0 91 indicating a strong correlation between the simulated and observed values of hydraulic head the discrepancies in the trends observed between these estimates of the l 1 and l 2 norms and the r value is suspected to be the result of the high statistical leverage apparent in the data while it is recognized that data with high statistical leverage can have influence on the overall regression results chatterjee and hadi 1986 we note that these extreme data clusters are observed in the simulated hydraulic heads produced by both the ssht and k eff scenarios which strongly suggests this trend to be a product of the small spatial scale associated with the area of interest used in this study furthermore the presence of these extreme data clusters produced by the ssht and k eff scenarios implies that both best fit lines likely contain a similar degree of influence from the high leverage data points since the presence of statistical leverage is consistent to the data sets produced by both scenarios we can assume that the overall findings remain unaffected by this influence another potential reason for the slight underperformance of the ssht scenario was the use of steady state head data for inverse modeling the inverse modeling of transient head data i e transient hydraulic tomography tht could yield both k and s s tomograms which should yield improved predictions of transient heads the use of tht to further improve site characterization during rpm flows could be investigated in future studies these observations suggest that while the ssht analysis is capable of generating a k tomogram that produces simulated transient hydraulic head responses with good correlation to those observed during rpm flow the effective parameter approach also yields adequate predictions of hydraulic head responses other studies that have used ht analysis to delineate a k field were performed in moderately to highly heterogeneous aquifers with σ 2 lnk of 6 5 brauchler et al 2011 cardiff et al 2012 hochstetler et al 2016 paradis et al 2016 zhao and illman 2018 where the use of a k tomogram led to significantly improved predictions of hydraulic head in comparison to the effective parameter approach zhao and illman 2018 thus the apparent ability of both the k tomogram and effective parameter approach to predict the transient hydraulic head changes during the rpm flow protocol is the consequence of the relative homogeneous nature of this aquifer and the small spatial scale of the area of interest used in this study as the degree of k heterogeneity and spatial scale increase the k tomogram as the representation of the k distribution is expected to yield improved predictions of the hydraulic responses that more closely resemble those observed during an operation of the rpm flow system than the effective parameter approach 2 6 impact of the k tomogram on mixing to investigate the impact of using the k tomogram on the spatial distribution of a hypothetical reagent various combinations of rpm flow parameters reorientation angle θ pumping duration t p and flow rate q were assessed the theoretical parameter q reported by lester et al 2010 represents an estimate of the degree of mixing possible for a specific combination of q tp and q and was used to select the rpm flow parameters to be assessed the set of rpm flow parameters that produced q 0 05 represented by the green region on figure 2 a in lester et al 2010 were chosen for evaluation in this study during the design process the spatial distribution of particle trajectories was used as a criterion for the selection of rpm flow parameters particle tracking simulations were performed using both the k tomogram and effective parameter approach for an rpm flow protocol these particle trajectories were then compared visually and quantitatively using the cumulative travel distance based on observations from the comparison of particle trajectories produced by the ssht and k eff scenarios one or more rpm flow parameter was adjusted to assess whether a higher degree of reagent mixing was feasible this process was repeated until a specific set of rpm flow parameters generated the most enhanced spatial distribution of particle trajectories in all the combinations of rpm flow parameters explored the ssht scenario produced complex intersecting particle trajectories that are significantly more spatially distributed in the area of interest than the k eff scenario for illustration a typical simulation result showing the particle trajectories relative to their initial positions are presented in fig 8 for one set of rpm flow parameters θ 135 or 3π 4 t p 45 min q 4 m3 d d 1 75 m n 18 and t 5 days in the ssht scenario fig 8 a to d all particles move in a direction that corresponds to the reorientation angle used in the rpm flow protocol the initial direction of particle movement is governed by the location of the first dipole in the pumping schedule with a slight skew in the pathlines towards the first extraction well for a period of time t 0 5 days the particles travel within the limits of this initial trajectory which produces regions of denser pathline distributions near the center of the ie well network however with increased number of rpm flow cycles the particles eventually move away from this initial trajectory and produce enhanced spatial coverage in the x and y directions within the area of interest while the overall particle trajectories show a symmetry related to the relatively homogeneous k field of the borden aquifer fig 8 e the range of k values observed within the area of interest albeit small produces a distribution that is spatially complex and dense in the z direction the particles show an overall change of 2 5 cm from their initial positions but no intersection of particle trajectories are evident conversely in the k eff scenario fig 8 f all particles remain near their initial positions in the x y and z directions for the simulation duration t 5 days based on other peer reviewed studies that have identified reagent mixing as a consequence of the complex distribution of intersecting particle trajectories produced by chaotic advection lester et al 2009 metcalfe et al 2010 these results suggest that a greater degree of spreading and mixing of the reagent solution is achieved in the ssht scenario in comparison to the k eff scenario these qualitative observations of particle trajectories are supported by the average cumulative distance travelled by the particles the incremental change in travel distance during each time step ranges from 0 7 to 5 1 cm for the ssht scenario and from 0 3 to 2 0 cm for the k eff scenario after a simulation period of 5 days 18 complete cycles of rpm flow n 18 the average distance travelled by all particles increases linearly towards a cumulative value of 30 39 0 41 m and 13 92 0 13 m for the ssht and k eff scenarios respectively a comparison of the cumulative travel distances from both scenarios indicate that the particle trajectories produced by the ssht scenario have longer travel distances and thus provide a greater spatial coverage within the area of interest indicative of enhanced reagent mixing this finding is consistent with other peer reviewed studies that also used particle tracking methods and demonstrated that reagent mixing is significantly enhanced when chaotic advection is used a heterogeneous k setting trefry et al 2012 neupauer et al 2014 since heterogeneities in the k field typically lead to variations in the velocity field and contribute to enhanced reagent mixing kitanidis and mccarty 2012 it is expected that for the same k field an rpm flow system would produce an even greater degree of reagent spreading and mixing than by natural processes advection and diffusion alone as the degree of k heterogeneity increases in the area of interest the particle trajectories are expected to be more complex and asymmetric these particle tracking results demonstrate that for the same set of rpm flow parameters the use of the k tomogram leads to significantly enhanced distribution and intersection of particle trajectories in all directions within the area of interest while both the ssht and k eff scenarios produced estimates of hydraulic head changes that resemble those observed during the operation of the rpm flow system the particle tracking results suggest that the improved representation of the variability in the k field has important implications on the mixing behavior of a reagent the improved spatial distribution of particle trajectories indicates that using k information applicable to a specific area of interest leads to an effective design of an rpm flow system that can enhance reagent mixing 3 conclusions the results demonstrate that the k tomogram determined from the inversion of hydraulic head observations during two independent dipole pumping tests yields simulated estimates of steady state and transient hydraulic heads that show good correlation to those observed in the area of interest as defined by the limits of the circular array of ie wells for the small spatial scale investigated in this relatively homogeneous aquifer the effective parameter approach was comparable to the k tomogram in its ability to simulate changes in hydraulic head that are representative of those observed while the flow simulations produced a similar range of hydraulic heads using both the k tomogram and effective parameter approach as representations of the k field the particle tracking results showed that incorporating the k tomogram significantly enhanced the spatial distribution of particle trajectories within the area of interest the use of the k tomogram generated more spatially and densely distributed particle trajectories indicative of enhanced reagent mixing than those produced by the effective parameter approach in which all particles showed minimal change from their initial positions for the entire simulation duration the findings from this study demonstrate that the same well system used to invoke chaotic advection can also be used in a ht analysis providing a viable site characterization tool to delineate the spatial variability of k in the area of interest in addition using k information applicable to a specific area of interest in a groundwater flow model with a particle tracking engine provides a tool that can be used for the design of an effective rpm flow system to promote enhanced reagent mixing while this proof of concept study presents supportive modeling tools for the characterization of the k field and the design of an effective rpm flow system potential limitations of the relative homogeneous nature of the aquifer and the small spatial scale of the area of interest were noted for improved robustness of these modeling tools this study should be extended to a larger area of interest at other field sites of varying degree of heterogeneity where the use of an rpm flow system is anticipated for the generation of chaotic advection to promote enhanced reagent mixing acknowledgements financial support for this investigation

1537,characterizing the mobility of uranium and vanadium in groundwater with a hydraulic connection to surface water is important to inform the best management practices of former mill tailing sites in this study the recharge of river water to the unsaturated and saturated zones of a uranium contaminated alluvial aquifer was simulated in a series of forced gradient single and multi well injection extraction tests the injection fluid river water was traced with natural and artificial tracers that included halides fluorobenzoates lithium and naphthalene sulfonate to characterize the potential mass transport mechanisms of uranium and vanadium the extraction fluid river water groundwater mixture was analyzed for the tracers uranium and vanadium the results from the tracers indicated that matrix diffusion was likely negligible over the spatiotemporal scales of the tests as evident by nearly identical breakthrough curves of the halides and fluorobenzoates in contrast the breakthrough curves of lithium and naphthalene sulfonate indicated that sorption by cation exchange and sorption to organic matter respectively were potential mass transport mechanisms of uranium and vanadium uranium was mobilized in the saturated zone containing gypsum gypsum rich zone the vadose zone vadose rich zone and the saturated zone containing organic carbon organic rich zone whereas vanadium was mobilized only in the saturated gypsum rich zone the mechanisms responsible for the mobilization of uranium and vanadium were likely dissolution of uranium and vanadium bearing minerals and or desorption from the gypsum rich zone flushing of uranium from the vadose rich zone and desorption of uranium from the organic rich zone due to the natural contrast in the geochemistry between the river water and groundwater the experimental design of this study was unique in that it employed the use of multiple natural and artificial tracers coupled with a direct injection of native river water to groundwater these results demonstrated that natural recharge and flooding events at former mill tailing sites can mobilize uranium and possibly vanadium and contribute to persistent levels of groundwater contamination keywords uranium vanadium groundwater surface water 1 introduction uranium and vanadium are naturally occurring contaminants with elemental abundances of approximately 2 7 and 135 milligrams per kilogram mg kg respectively in the earth s continental crust taylor 1964 uranium and vanadium also occur at concentrations in exceedance of regulatory drinking water levels in regional aquifers throughout the united states nolan and weber 2015 wright and belitz 2010 and abroad bacquart et al 2015 banning et al 2013 ono et al 2019 the maximum contaminant level for uranium in drinking water in the united states is 30 micrograms per liter μg l epa 2019b although there is no maximum contaminant level for vanadium in drinking water the united states environmental protection agency lists vanadium on its contaminant candidate list epa 2019a and the state of california proposed an action level 15 μg l oehha 2019 potential health effects from long term exposure to uranium are well known and include an increased risk of cancer and kidney toxicity epa 2019b whereas vanadium is thought to have a negative effect on unborn children and neonates that can result in low birth weights and lengths oehha 2019 natural processes such as dissolution and desorption from radionuclide rich minerals and rocks banning and ruede 2015 liesch et al 2015 mikkonen et al 2019 nicolli et al 2012 and anthropogenic activities such as refining and milling of radionuclides miao et al 2013 newsome et al 2014 may contribute to uranium and vanadium contaminated groundwater shallow aquifers are particularly susceptible to contamination due to anthropogenic activities at the ground surface and geochemical conditions in shallow groundwater that favor the mobility of uranium and vanadium nolan and weber 2015 wright and belitz 2010 uranium and vanadium are redox sensitive radionuclides uranium u primarily exists in two oxidation states u vi and u iv the oxidized state u vi is relatively mobile as compared to the reduced state u iv singh et al 2014 similarly vanadium v primarily exists in two oxidation states v v and v iv and the oxidized state v v is relatively mobile as compared to the reduced state v iv wright and belitz 2010 thermodynamically uranium and vanadium are typically more mobile under oxidizing and alkaline conditions as compared to reducing and acidic conditions dong and brooks 2006 wanty and goldhaber 1992 waseem et al 2015 wehrli and stumm 1989 however uranium and vanadium in their oxidized states u vi and v v respectively can become immobilized by adsorption to mineral surfaces giammar and hering 2001 wright et al 2014 moreover the presence of organic matter has been shown to enhance adsorption of u vi and v v to mineral surfaces murphy et al 1999 peng and korshin 2011 the mobility of uranium and vanadium can also be affected by matrix diffusion i e molecular diffusion from advection active to advection dormant pore spaces maloszewski and zuber 1985 maloszewski and zuber 1993 nitzsche and merkel 1999 the mobility of uranium and vanadium in shallow aquifers that are in direct hydraulic contact with surface waters is an emerging area of scientific research recent studies have shown that the recharge and discharge of surface water to and from radionuclide contaminated groundwater can have a strong effect on the mobility of uranium johnson et al 2012 ma et al 2014 ma et al 2010 slater et al 2010 wu et al 2018 zachara et al 2016 zachara et al 2016 monitored a shallow uranium contaminated aquifer that was in direct hydraulic contact with the columbia river for three years and concluded that uranium was mobilized during natural recharge of surface water to groundwater due to the rise in water table and subsequent flushing of residual uranium from the unsaturated zone zachara et al 2016 also concluded that uranium was mobilized in part due to desorption during natural recharge of surface water to groundwater in the same aquifer ma et al 2014 conducted a 16 day natural gradient tracer test to characterize the mobility of uranium the injection fluid was nearly identical in geochemistry to the aquifer fluid but contained artificial added bromide as a non reactive conservative tracer and uranium u vi at a lower concentration ma et al 2014 ma et al 2014 concluded that desorption as opposed to matrix diffusion was the predominant mechanism for mobilizing uranium despite the mobilizing effect that the natural recharge of surface water to groundwater can have on radionuclides such as uranium no study to date has conducted a controlled injection of native surface water to the unsaturated and saturated zones of a hydraulically connected and uranium contaminated aquifer the objective of this study was to characterize the mobility of uranium and vanadium in an alluvial aquifer during the injection of nearby surface water based on the results of previous studies and the hydrogeology of the study site we hypothesized that uranium and vanadium associated with the solid phase aquifer material would be mobilized by the recharge of surface water in the unsaturated and saturated zones 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the description history and regulatory setting of the study site were summarized in detail by the united states department of energy office of legacy management doe 2018 in brief the site is in grand junction colorado approximately 250 miles west of denver and 25 miles east of the utah border fig 1 the gunnison river flows along the western and northern boundaries of the site and drains into the colorado river less than a mile north of the site fig 1 the gunnison river is in direct hydraulic contact with the alluvial aquifer beneath the site fig 1 the site was originally acquired by the united states war department in 1943 and operated as a refinery to concentrate uranium oxides from vanadium mill tailings until 1946 in 1953 the site operated as an experimental milling facility for uranium ore until 1958 when uranium related operations ceased approximately 250 000 cubic yards of uranium contaminated mill tailings soils and sediments were removed from the site between 1989 and 2014 the site is currently managed by the united states department of energy office of legacy management the site is subject to long term groundwater and surface water monitoring for leaching of contaminants related to historical uranium refining and milling processes doe 2006 all post milling uranium tailings have been removed to a licensed disposal facility but uranium concentrations in groundwater currently exceed the maximum site regulatory contamination limit of 44 μg l doe 2016 the hydrogeology of the site was summarized in detail by the united states department of energy office of legacy management doe 2005 in brief the site is underlain by an alluvial aquifer comprised of heterogeneous silts and sands from approximately 0 to 5 feet below ground surface bgs and sands and gravels from approximately 5 to 25 feet bgs the aquifer is underlain by relatively impermeable shales and sandstones of the morrison formation based on pumping tests the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer material is approximately 30 to 45 feet per day ft day doe 2006 and within the range typically reported for clean sands freeze and cherry 1979 the depth to groundwater is approximately 5 to 10 feet bgs depending on the elevation of the gunnison river groundwater discharges from the aquifer to the river during low elevations of the river i e when the gunnison is a gaining river conversely groundwater recharges from the river to the aquifer during high elevations of the river i e when the gunnison is a losing river historically periodic flooding of the river was a natural occurrence but has been controlled by the installation of an earthen dike along the river site boundary fig 1 nevertheless should flooding of the river occur today groundwater recharge would also likely occur via vertical infiltration from the ground surface through the unsaturated zone and into the saturated zone the site contained eight permanent groundwater monitoring wells completed in the alluvial aquifer prior to the installation of an additional eight new wells used in this study fig 1 the maximum concentrations of uranium in well 8 4s fig 1 over the last decade have been relatively high up to approximately 0 7 mg l and variable showing no clear trend as compared to the other wells doe 2016 therefore eight borings were drilled within the vicinity of well 8 4s to better characterize the vertical and horizontal extent of solid phase uranium and its associations if any with geochemical conditions by conducting selective extractions of uranium combined with petrography fission track radiology and x ray diffraction fig 1 doe 2018b the results of the borings suggested the following 1 elevated concentrations of uranium were associated with gypsum above and below the median water table level to the north of 8 4s referred to hereafter as the gypsum rich zone 2 elevated concentrations of uranium were associated with the vadose zone i e above the median water table to the south of 8 4s referred to hereafter as the vadose rich zone and 3 elevated concentrations of uranium were associated with organic carbon below the median water table level to the southeast of 8 4s referred to hereafter as the organic rich zone fig 2 in addition to the eight borings eight new groundwater monitoring wells were installed throughout the zones to better characterize the aqueous geochemistry as follows 1 wells 121 and 120 in the gypsum rich zone 2 wells 110 117 and 118 in the vadose rich zone and 3 wells 100 106 and 108 in the organic rich zone fig 1 the results of preliminary groundwater and river water sampling indicated that the groundwater in each of the three zones contained elevated levels of chloride uranium vanadium gypsum rich zone only alkalinity calcium and magnesium as compared to the river water whereas ph was slightly lower table 1 the wells were installed using a direct push drill rig and are constructed of schedule 40 polyvinyl chloride casing and pre packed screens 0 010 inch slotted well 117 was completed in the unsaturated zone with a screen length of five feet whereas the remaining wells were completed in the saturated zone with screen lengths of five feet wells 121 120 110 118 100 and 108 or one foot well 106 wells 121 and 120 are 0 75 inches in inside diameter whereas the remaining wells are 1 5 inches in inside diameter all wells were completed with a sand pack 20 40 mesh around the screened interval that extended approximately two feet above the top of the screens and with a bentonite clay seal above the sand pack to approximately one foot bgs finally all wells were completed at the surface with one foot thick concrete seal and a three foot stick up that was protected by an outer steel casing 2 2 natural non added and artificial added tracers several tracers were used to characterize mass transport mechanisms e g advection mechanical dispersion molecular diffusion sorption and reactivity table 2 chloride was used as a natural non added conservative tracer during each test due to its natural contrast of concentrations between the injection river and aquifer groundwater fluids table 1 to characterize non reactive mass transport e g advection mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion table 2 chloride along with other halides e g bromide and iodide have been traditionally used to characterize non reactive mass transport and remain popular as conservative tracers today davis et al 1980 hu and moran 2005 therefore the halides of bromide and iodide were also used but as artificial added conservative tracers table 2 pentafluorobenzoate pfb and 2 6 di fluorobenzoate dfb were used as artificial conservative tracers to characterize mass transport of solutes from mobile to immobile zones due to molecular diffusion i e matrix diffusion in the aquifer table 2 the aqueous diffusion co efficients of pfb and dfb are approximately three times less as compared to bromide and iodide bowman and gibbens 1992 and similar contrasts in the diffusivity of non reactive tracers have been used to characterize matrix diffusion in numerous previous studies callahan et al 2000 hu and brusseau 1995 reimus et al 2003 salve et al 2004 if matrix diffusion occurred it would be expected that pfb and dfb would have a higher maximum concentration relative to its injection concentration during early arrival times as compared to bromide and iodide and that bromide and iodide would demonstrate sustained concentrations during late arrival times commonly referred to as tailing as compared to pfb and dfb lithium was used as an artificial non conservative tracer to characterize sorption by cation exchange table 2 lithium is a relatively weak sorbing tracer by cation exchange to clay and zeolite minerals anghel et al 2002 newman et al 1991 sullivan et al 2003 uranium u in its plus six oxidation state u vi much like lithium is also a sorbing tracer by cation exchange to clay and zeolite minerals bachmaf and merkel 2011 camacho et al 2010 therefore sorption of lithium to clays in the aquifer may be a proxy for sorption of u vi if sorption occurred it would be expected that the mean arrival time of lithium would be later as compared to non reactive tracers with similar aqueous diffusion co efficients e g bromide and iodide however it should be noted that sorption of u vi is highly dependent on ph and alkalinity dangelmayr et al 2017 um et al 2007 2 naphthalene sulfonate ns was used as an artificial non conservative tracer to characterize sorption to organic matter table 2 2 naphthalene sulfonate ns is a relatively strong sorbing tracer to activated carbon chang et al 2003 uranium u in its plus six oxidation state u vi much like ns is also a relatively strong sorbing species to activated carbon mellah et al 2006 therefore sorption of ns to carbon bearing species in the aquifer e g organic matter may be a proxy for sorption of u vi if sorption occurred it would be expected that the mean arrival time of ns would be later as compared to non reactive tracers with similar aqueous diffusion co efficients e g pfb and dfb however as previously stated sorption of u vi is highly dependent on ph and alkalinity all artificial anionic tracers were added to the injection fluid river water as sodium salts except for bromide which was added as lithium bromide table 2 chloride and bromide were quantified by ion chromatography ic using a dionex aquion equipped with an electrical conductivity ec detector iodide pfb dfb and ns were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography hplc using a thermo scientific ultimate 3000 equipped with an ultra violet uv detector set at a wavelength of 223 nanometers nm for iodide and 222 nm for pfb dfb and ns lithium uranium and vanadium were quantified by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes using a perkin elmer optima 7000 set at wavelengths of 610 362 385 958 and 290 880 nm for lithium uranium and vanadium respectively uranium was also quantified by kinetic phosphorescence analysis kpa using a chemcheck kpa 11 set at an excitation wavelength of 425 nm and an emission wavelength of 515 nm ns was quantified by fluorimetry using a shimadzu rf 5301pc spectrofluorophotometer set to excitation wavelength of 222 nm and an emission wavelength of 338 nm 2 3 single well push pull tests single well push pull tests were conducted in wells 121 and 120 gypsum rich zone 110 vadose rich zone and 106 organic rich zone figs 1 and 2 according to the general methodology of istok 2013 the push phase of the tests consisted of a forced gradient injection of a known volume of river water containing a known mass of artificial added tracers followed by the injection of artificial tracer free river water commonly referred to as chase water into a single well table 3 the push phase was followed by a period of non pumping to allow the injection fluid to transport in the aquifer under natural gradient conditions commonly referred to as the drift phase the pull phase of the tests consisted of a forced gradient extraction of water comprised of a mixture of the injection fluid river water and aquifer fluid groundwater from the same well the concentrations of the natural non added artificial added and reactive analytes e g uranium and vanadium were quantified in the injection aquifer and extraction fluids and used to generate concentration verses time profiles i e breakthrough curves during the extraction phase the injection volumes were selected to interrogate a volume of the aquifer that was representative of macroscopic scale flow and transport processes and the chase volumes were selected to clear the standing well volumes of artificial tracers table 3 the injection rates were selected to be high enough to complete the injection within a 24 hour period yet low enough to avoid substantial mounding of the water table table 3 the drift times were selected to be long enough to allow the tracers to migrate under natural gradient conditions that were representative of ambient flow yet short enough to recover enough mass of the tracers to allow for reliable data analysis and interpretation table 3 the extraction rates were set equal to the injection rates and the extraction volumes were selected to be high enough to recover enough mass of tracers yet low enough to mitigate the costs of waste water disposal table 3 2 4 cross hole injection extraction tests cross hole injection extraction tests were conducted in well pairs 118 110 and 117 110 vadose rich zone and 108 100 organic rich zone figs 1 and 2 and in a similar manner as the single well push pull tests the injection phase of the tests consisted of a forced gradient injection of a known volume of river water containing a known mass of artificial added tracers followed by the injection of artificial tracer free river chase water into the injection well table 4 the injection phase was accompanied by a forced gradient extraction of water comprised of a mixture of the injection fluid river water and aquifer fluid groundwater from the extraction well the concentrations of the natural non added artificial added and reactive analytes e g uranium and vanadium were quantified in the injection aquifer and extraction fluids and used to generate breakthrough curves during the extraction phase the injection and extraction volumes and rates of the cross hole tests were selected to be similar to the push pull tests tables 3 and 4 2 5 data analysis the data from the single well push pull and cross hole tests were analyzed according to the general methodology of paradis et al 2019 the expected concentration of a reactive analyte e g uranium vanadium due to dilution between the injection and aquifer fluids during the extraction phase was calculated as given by 1 c e r t c e c t c a c c i c c a c c i r c a r c a r where c e r t expected concentration of reactive analyte in the extraction fluid due to dilution ce c t concentration of non reactive conservative tracer in the extraction fluid ca c concentration of non reactive conservative tracer in the aquifer fluid ci c concentration of non reactive conservative tracer in the injection fluid ci r concentration of reactive analyte in the injection fluid ca r concentration of reactive analyte in the aquifer fluid equation 1 assumes that the mass transport characteristics of both the conservative tracer and reactive analyte are no different therefore any difference between the expected concentration of the reactive analyte c e r t and the measured concentration of the reactive analyte c e r t in the extraction fluid was attributed to one or more mass transport characteristics other than dilution furthermore the recovery factor of the reactive analyte during the extraction phase which indicates either a net addition greater than 1 net removal less than 1 or no change equal to 1 with respect to the aqueous phase was calculated as given by 2 r 0 t c e r t dt 0 t c e r t dt where r recovery factor dimensionless 0 t c e r t dt area under the measured concentration versus time data during the extraction phase 0 t c e r t dt area under the expected concentration versus time data during the extraction phase the integrals in equation 2 were estimated numerically using the trapezoidal rule as given by 3 r n 2 n c e r t n 1 c e r t n 2 t n t n 1 n 2 n c e r t n 1 c e r t n 2 t n t n 1 where n time point of the concentration data n final time point of the concentration data 3 results and discussion 3 1 single well push pull tests 3 1 1 artificial added tracers pfb and iodide the concentrations of pfb and iodide relative to their injected concentrations c co versus their extracted volume relative to their injected volume v vo during the extraction phase were nearly identical among each of the four tests fig 3 the percent mass recoveries of pfb and iodide during the extraction phase were also nearly identical among each of the four tests and ranged from 81 to 102 table 5 the percent mass recoveries in exceedance of 100 were likely due to error propagation resulting from uncertainties in the following 1 injection volume 2 extraction rate and 3 numerical integration of the relative concentration versus relative volume data these results demonstrated that the mass transport characteristics of pfb and iodide were nearly identical under the test conditions however minor tailing of iodide was observed for well 120 at relative concentrations below approximately 0 05 or 5 fig 3 and suggested that some matrix diffusion occurred the drift time for well 120 was relatively long 8 days as compared to the other tests 1 7 to 2 9 days table 3 and matrix diffusion is well known to be time dependent i e matrix diffusion increases with time maloszewski and zuber 1985 therefore it is possible that some time dependent matrix diffusion occurred in well 120 nevertheless these results strongly suggested that matrix diffusion was negligible to minor in the saturated zones of the gypsum rich vadose rich and organic rich zones 3 1 2 natural non added conservative tracer chloride the breakthrough curves of measured chloride during the extraction phase were initially at or very near the concentration of the injection fluid and gradually approached that of the aquifer fluid as time increased for each of the four tests fig 4 however the breakthrough curve of chloride for well 120 approached a concentration slightly less 20 mg l less than the aquifer fluid fig 4 as mentioned in the previous section the drift time for well 120 was relatively long as compared to the other tests table 3 moreover the concentration of chloride in the aquifer was measured immediately prior to the injection phase and was assumed to be constant over the time period of the tests therefore it is possible that the concentration of chloride in the aquifer fluid within the immediate vicinity of well 120 which was sampled discretely from a relatively small volume prior to the injection phase was notably higher than in the larger vicinity of well 120 which was continuously sampled during the larger volume extraction phase due to the heterogeneous nature of the aquifer nevertheless the natural contrast of concentrations of chloride between the injection river and aquifer groundwater fluids and its breakthrough curves indicated that it could be used to represent non reactive conservative transport during the tests finally it should be noted that the breakthrough curves of measured versus expected i e due to dilution between the injection and aquifer fluids chloride were identical and thus the recovery factors of chloride were equal to one as defined by equations 1 2 and 3 and quantitatively defined no net addition or removal from the aqueous phase fig 4 3 1 3 uranium and vanadium the breakthrough curves of measured versus expected uranium were not identical among each of the four tests during the extraction phase fig 5 these results indicated that the mass transport characteristics of chloride and uranium were not identical the measured concentration of uranium exceeded the expected concentration of uranium for wells 121 and 120 and resulted in recovery factors greater than one fig 5 these results indicated that a net addition of uranium from the aquifer to the extraction fluid groundwater river water mixture occurred for wells 121 and 120 in the gypsum rich zone the mechanisms responsible for the mobilization of uranium were likely dissolution of uranium bearing minerals and or desorption due to the natural contrast in the geochemistry between the river water and groundwater for example the concentration of uranium and cations that are common in uranium bearing minerals e g potassium calcium and magnesium in the river water tends to be consistently lower as compared to the groundwater from well 8 4s doe 2016 and would likely favor dissolution of uranium bearing minerals similarly the ph of the river water tends to be consistently higher as compared to the groundwater from well 8 4s doe 2016 and would likely desorb and mobilize solid phase oxidized uranium u vi singh et al 2014 another possible mechanism for the mobilization of uranium in wells 121 and 120 i e the gypsum rich zone figs 1 and 2 was dissolution of uranium bearing gypsum in the saturated zone for example lin et al 2018 demonstrated that u vi in the form of uranyl uo2 2 was the dominant species at the calcium ca2 site on synthetic gypsum over a range in ph from 6 5 to 9 5 the measured concentration of uranium was similar to the expected concentration of uranium for wells 110 and resulted in recovery factor nearly equal to one fig 5 these results indicated that no net addition or removal of uranium from the aquifer to the extraction fluid groundwater river water mixture occurred for well 110 in the saturated zone these results were expected given that uranium is associated with the vadose zone in the vicinity of well 110 figs 1 and 2 as opposed to the saturated zone of which well 110 was completed in contrast the measured concentration of uranium exceeded the expected concentration of uranium for well 106 and resulted in a recovery factor greater than one fig 5 these results indicated that a net addition of uranium from the aquifer to the extraction fluid groundwater river water mixture occurred for well 106 in the organic rich zone the mechanism responsible for the mobilization of uranium was likely desorption from organic rich sediments the measured concentration of vanadium exceeded the expected concentration of vanadium for wells 121 and 120 and resulted in recovery factors much greater than one fig 6 interestingly vanadium was not detectable 0 04 mg l in either the injection or aquifer fluids in well 120 yet vanadium was measured at concentrations of approximately 0 2 mg l in the extraction fluid fig 6 these results indicated that a net addition of vanadium from the aquifer to the extraction fluid groundwater river water mixture occurred for wells 121 and 120 in the gypsum rich zone the mechanisms responsible for the mobilization of vanadium were likely dissolution of vanadium uranium bearing minerals and or desorption due to the natural contrast in the geochemistry between the river water and groundwater in contrast vanadium was not detectable 0 04 mg l in the injection aquifer and extraction fluids in wells 110 and 106 fig 6 these results indicated that no net addition or removal of vanadium from the aquifer to the extraction fluid groundwater river water mixture occurred for wells 110 and 106 in the vadose rich and organic rich zones respectively in summary both uranium and vanadium were mobilized in wells 121 and 120 in the gypsum rich zone whereas only uranium was mobilized in well 106 in the organic rich zone and neither uranium nor vanadium was mobilized in well 110 in the vadose rich zone these results demonstrated that recharge of river water mobilized uranium in the saturated zones where uranium was known to exist e g the gypsum rich and organic rich zones figs 1 and 2 moreover these results demonstrated that recharge of river water mobilized vanadium in the saturated zones where vanadium was not detectable in neither injection nor aquifer fluids e g well 120 in the gypsum rich zone figs 1 and 2 as previously stated the mechanisms responsible for the mobilization of uranium and possibly vanadium were likely dissolution and or desorption however it should be noted that dissolution of uranyl bearing gypsum was also a possible mechanism for the mobilization of uranium in the gypsum rich zone i e wells 121 and 120 3 2 cross hole injection extraction tests 3 2 1 artificial added tracers pfb dfb iodide bromide lithium and ns the relative concentrations of pfb and iodine versus the relative volume during the extraction phase were nearly identical for the injection extraction well pair 118 110 fig 7 the percent mass recoveries of pfb and iodide during the extraction phase were also nearly identical for the injection extraction well pair 118 110 35 table 6 these results demonstrated that the mass transport characteristics of pfb and iodide were nearly identical under the test conditions and that matrix diffusion was likely negligible in the saturated zone between well pair 118 110 in the vadose rich zone figs 1 and 2 the relative concentrations of dfb and bromide versus the relative volume during the extraction phase were nearly identical for the injection extraction well pair 117 110 fig 7 the percent mass recoveries of dfb and bromide during the extraction phase were also nearly identical for the injection extraction well pair 117 110 8 0 and 6 4 respectively table 6 these results demonstrated that the mass transport characteristics of dfb and bromide were nearly identical under the test conditions and that matrix diffusion was likely negligible in the unsaturated to saturated zones between well pair 117 110 in the vadose rich zone figs 1 and 2 however the relative concentration of lithium versus relative volume during the extraction phase was substantially less than dfb and bromide fig 7 as was the percent mass recovery of lithium 0 055 table 6 these results demonstrated that the mass transport characteristics of lithium as compared to dfb and bromide were not identical under the test conditions the mechanism responsible for the immobilization of lithium was likely sorption by cation exchange due to cation sites on the aquifer materials being devoid of lithium prior to its injection as a tracer as evident by lithium concentrations that were not detectable in neither the aquifer nor river water prior to lithium addition data not shown the relative concentrations of dfb bromide and ns versus the relative volume during the extraction phase were very similar for the injection extraction well pair 108 100 fig 7 the percent mass recoveries of dfb bromide and ns during the extraction phase were also similar for the injection extraction well pair 108 100 45 41 and 38 respectively table 6 these results demonstrated that the mass transport characteristics of dfb bromide and ns were similar under the test conditions and that matrix diffusion and sorption to organics were likely negligible in saturated zones between well pair 108 100 in the organic rich zone figs 1 and 2 however it should be noted the relative concentration of ns decreased substantially as compared to dfb and bromide during a period of non pumping data not shown and suggested that sorption of ns occurred during natural gradient conditions figs 1 and 2 the relative concentration of lithium versus relative volume during the extraction phase was substantially less than dfb and bromide fig 7 as was the percent mass recovery of lithium 9 8 table 6 these results demonstrated that the mass transport characteristics of lithium as compared to dfb and bromide were not identical under the test conditions as was the case for injection extraction well pair 117 110 the mechanism responsible for the immobilization of lithium was likely sorption by cation exchange finally the double humped shape of the relative concentration versus relative volume during the extraction phase for the injection extraction well pair 108 100 fig 7 deserves a brief explanation a series of borehole dilution tests were conducted in well 100 prior to the tracer tests and suggested that well 100 was screened across two discrete flow zones an upper zone of low specific discharge and a lower zone of high specific discharge data not shown therefore the mass transport through the zones of high and low specific discharge are likely represented by the first and second humps respectively fig 7 3 2 2 natural non added conservative tracer chloride the breakthrough curves of measured chloride during the extraction phase were initially at or very near the concentration of the aquifer fluid and gradually decreased as time increased for each of the three tests fig 8 the natural contrast of concentrations of chloride between the injection river and aquifer groundwater fluids and its breakthrough curves indicated that it could be used to represent non reactive conservative transport during the tests 3 2 3 uranium and vanadium the breakthrough curves of measured versus expected uranium were not identical among each of the three tests in the extraction wells fig 9 these results indicated that the mass transport characteristics of chloride and uranium were not identical the measured concentration of uranium exceeded the expected concentration of uranium for each of the three tests and resulted in recovery factors greater than one fig 9 these results indicated that a net addition of uranium from the aquifer to the extraction fluid groundwater river water mixture occurred for the two tests in the vadose rich zone and the one test in the organic rich zone figs 1 and 2 the mechanism responsible for the mobilization of uranium in the saturated zones was likely desorption due to the natural contrast in the geochemistry between the river water and groundwater however an additional mechanism responsible for the mobilization of uranium in the vadose rich zone was likely flushing of residual mass from the unsaturated to the saturated zone vanadium was not detectable 0 04 mg l in the injection aquifer and extraction fluids in the extraction wells data not shown these results indicated that no net addition or removal of vanadium from the aquifer to the extraction fluid groundwater river water mixture occurred for the extraction wells in summary uranium and not vanadium was mobilized in the extraction wells 110 and 100 in the vadose rich and organic rich zones these results demonstrated that recharge of river water mobilized uranium in the unsaturated and saturated zones where uranium was known to exist figs 1 and 2 as previously stated the mechanisms responsible for the mobilization of uranium were likely desorption in the saturated zones due to the natural contrast in the geochemistry between the river water and groundwater and flushing of residual mass from the unsaturated zone 4 conclusions the recharge of river water to the unsaturated and saturated zones of a uranium contaminated aquifer was simulated in a series of forced gradient single and multi well injection extraction tracer tests the breakthrough curves of tracers with dissimilar aqueous diffusion co efficients were nearly identical and indicated that matrix diffusion was negligible however the breakthrough curves of tracers known to sorb by cation exchange and to organic carbon behaved non conservatively and indicated that desorption was a potential mass transport mechanism uranium was mobilized in the unsaturated and saturated zones where uranium was known to be associated with gypsum the vadose zone and organic carbon whereas vanadium was mobilized only in the saturated zone associated with gypsum the natural contrast in the geochemistry of the river water and groundwater likely resulted in the dissolution of uranium and vanadium bearing minerals and or desorption from the saturated zones moreover flushing of residual mass from the unsaturated zone likely resulted in the mobilization of uranium the results of this study provided field scale and direct evidence that the recharge of native surface water to hydraulically connected groundwater can mobilize uranium and vanadium and resulted in a revised site conceptual model to reflect these important findings fig 10 the results of this study implied that natural recharge and flooding events of surface water to groundwater at former mill tailing sites will mobilize uranium and possibly vanadium and contribute to persistent levels of groundwater contamination finally the results of this study will inform the development of a site wide reactive transport model to further elucidate the mass transport mechanisms

1537,characterizing the mobility of uranium and vanadium in groundwater with a hydraulic connection to surface water is important to inform the best management practices of former mill tailing sites in this study the recharge of river water to the unsaturated and saturated zones of a uranium contaminated alluvial aquifer was simulated in a series of forced gradient single and multi well injection extraction tests the injection fluid river water was traced with natural and artificial tracers that included halides fluorobenzoates lithium and naphthalene sulfonate to characterize the potential mass transport mechanisms of uranium and vanadium the extraction fluid river water groundwater mixture was analyzed for the tracers uranium and vanadium the results from the tracers indicated that matrix diffusion was likely negligible over the spatiotemporal scales of the tests as evident by nearly identical breakthrough curves of the halides and fluorobenzoates in contrast the breakthrough curves of lithium and naphthalene sulfonate indicated that sorption by cation exchange and sorption to organic matter respectively were potential mass transport mechanisms of uranium and vanadium uranium was mobilized in the saturated zone containing gypsum gypsum rich zone the vadose zone vadose rich zone and the saturated zone containing organic carbon organic rich zone whereas vanadium was mobilized only in the saturated gypsum rich zone the mechanisms responsible for the mobilization of uranium and vanadium were likely dissolution of uranium and vanadium bearing minerals and or desorption from the gypsum rich zone flushing of uranium from the vadose rich zone and desorption of uranium from the organic rich zone due to the natural contrast in the geochemistry between the river water and groundwater the experimental design of this study was unique in that it employed the use of multiple natural and artificial tracers coupled with a direct injection of native river water to groundwater these results demonstrated that natural recharge and flooding events at former mill tailing sites can mobilize uranium and possibly vanadium and contribute to persistent levels of groundwater contamination keywords uranium vanadium groundwater surface water 1 introduction uranium and vanadium are naturally occurring contaminants with elemental abundances of approximately 2 7 and 135 milligrams per kilogram mg kg respectively in the earth s continental crust taylor 1964 uranium and vanadium also occur at concentrations in exceedance of regulatory drinking water levels in regional aquifers throughout the united states nolan and weber 2015 wright and belitz 2010 and abroad bacquart et al 2015 banning et al 2013 ono et al 2019 the maximum contaminant level for uranium in drinking water in the united states is 30 micrograms per liter μg l epa 2019b although there is no maximum contaminant level for vanadium in drinking water the united states environmental protection agency lists vanadium on its contaminant candidate list epa 2019a and the state of california proposed an action level 15 μg l oehha 2019 potential health effects from long term exposure to uranium are well known and include an increased risk of cancer and kidney toxicity epa 2019b whereas vanadium is thought to have a negative effect on unborn children and neonates that can result in low birth weights and lengths oehha 2019 natural processes such as dissolution and desorption from radionuclide rich minerals and rocks banning and ruede 2015 liesch et al 2015 mikkonen et al 2019 nicolli et al 2012 and anthropogenic activities such as refining and milling of radionuclides miao et al 2013 newsome et al 2014 may contribute to uranium and vanadium contaminated groundwater shallow aquifers are particularly susceptible to contamination due to anthropogenic activities at the ground surface and geochemical conditions in shallow groundwater that favor the mobility of uranium and vanadium nolan and weber 2015 wright and belitz 2010 uranium and vanadium are redox sensitive radionuclides uranium u primarily exists in two oxidation states u vi and u iv the oxidized state u vi is relatively mobile as compared to the reduced state u iv singh et al 2014 similarly vanadium v primarily exists in two oxidation states v v and v iv and the oxidized state v v is relatively mobile as compared to the reduced state v iv wright and belitz 2010 thermodynamically uranium and vanadium are typically more mobile under oxidizing and alkaline conditions as compared to reducing and acidic conditions dong and brooks 2006 wanty and goldhaber 1992 waseem et al 2015 wehrli and stumm 1989 however uranium and vanadium in their oxidized states u vi and v v respectively can become immobilized by adsorption to mineral surfaces giammar and hering 2001 wright et al 2014 moreover the presence of organic matter has been shown to enhance adsorption of u vi and v v to mineral surfaces murphy et al 1999 peng and korshin 2011 the mobility of uranium and vanadium can also be affected by matrix diffusion i e molecular diffusion from advection active to advection dormant pore spaces maloszewski and zuber 1985 maloszewski and zuber 1993 nitzsche and merkel 1999 the mobility of uranium and vanadium in shallow aquifers that are in direct hydraulic contact with surface waters is an emerging area of scientific research recent studies have shown that the recharge and discharge of surface water to and from radionuclide contaminated groundwater can have a strong effect on the mobility of uranium johnson et al 2012 ma et al 2014 ma et al 2010 slater et al 2010 wu et al 2018 zachara et al 2016 zachara et al 2016 monitored a shallow uranium contaminated aquifer that was in direct hydraulic contact with the columbia river for three years and concluded that uranium was mobilized during natural recharge of surface water to groundwater due to the rise in water table and subsequent flushing of residual uranium from the unsaturated zone zachara et al 2016 also concluded that uranium was mobilized in part due to desorption during natural recharge of surface water to groundwater in the same aquifer ma et al 2014 conducted a 16 day natural gradient tracer test to characterize the mobility of uranium the injection fluid was nearly identical in geochemistry to the aquifer fluid but contained artificial added bromide as a non reactive conservative tracer and uranium u vi at a lower concentration ma et al 2014 ma et al 2014 concluded that desorption as opposed to matrix diffusion was the predominant mechanism for mobilizing uranium despite the mobilizing effect that the natural recharge of surface water to groundwater can have on radionuclides such as uranium no study to date has conducted a controlled injection of native surface water to the unsaturated and saturated zones of a hydraulically connected and uranium contaminated aquifer the objective of this study was to characterize the mobility of uranium and vanadium in an alluvial aquifer during the injection of nearby surface water based on the results of previous studies and the hydrogeology of the study site we hypothesized that uranium and vanadium associated with the solid phase aquifer material would be mobilized by the recharge of surface water in the unsaturated and saturated zones 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the description history and regulatory setting of the study site were summarized in detail by the united states department of energy office of legacy management doe 2018 in brief the site is in grand junction colorado approximately 250 miles west of denver and 25 miles east of the utah border fig 1 the gunnison river flows along the western and northern boundaries of the site and drains into the colorado river less than a mile north of the site fig 1 the gunnison river is in direct hydraulic contact with the alluvial aquifer beneath the site fig 1 the site was originally acquired by the united states war department in 1943 and operated as a refinery to concentrate uranium oxides from vanadium mill tailings until 1946 in 1953 the site operated as an experimental milling facility for uranium ore until 1958 when uranium related operations ceased approximately 250 000 cubic yards of uranium contaminated mill tailings soils and sediments were removed from the site between 1989 and 2014 the site is currently managed by the united states department of energy office of legacy management the site is subject to long term groundwater and surface water monitoring for leaching of contaminants related to historical uranium refining and milling processes doe 2006 all post milling uranium tailings have been removed to a licensed disposal facility but uranium concentrations in groundwater currently exceed the maximum site regulatory contamination limit of 44 μg l doe 2016 the hydrogeology of the site was summarized in detail by the united states department of energy office of legacy management doe 2005 in brief the site is underlain by an alluvial aquifer comprised of heterogeneous silts and sands from approximately 0 to 5 feet below ground surface bgs and sands and gravels from approximately 5 to 25 feet bgs the aquifer is underlain by relatively impermeable shales and sandstones of the morrison formation based on pumping tests the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer material is approximately 30 to 45 feet per day ft day doe 2006 and within the range typically reported for clean sands freeze and cherry 1979 the depth to groundwater is approximately 5 to 10 feet bgs depending on the elevation of the gunnison river groundwater discharges from the aquifer to the river during low elevations of the river i e when the gunnison is a gaining river conversely groundwater recharges from the river to the aquifer during high elevations of the river i e when the gunnison is a losing river historically periodic flooding of the river was a natural occurrence but has been controlled by the installation of an earthen dike along the river site boundary fig 1 nevertheless should flooding of the river occur today groundwater recharge would also likely occur via vertical infiltration from the ground surface through the unsaturated zone and into the saturated zone the site contained eight permanent groundwater monitoring wells completed in the alluvial aquifer prior to the installation of an additional eight new wells used in this study fig 1 the maximum concentrations of uranium in well 8 4s fig 1 over the last decade have been relatively high up to approximately 0 7 mg l and variable showing no clear trend as compared to the other wells doe 2016 therefore eight borings were drilled within the vicinity of well 8 4s to better characterize the vertical and horizontal extent of solid phase uranium and its associations if any with geochemical conditions by conducting selective extractions of uranium combined with petrography fission track radiology and x ray diffraction fig 1 doe 2018b the results of the borings suggested the following 1 elevated concentrations of uranium were associated with gypsum above and below the median water table level to the north of 8 4s referred to hereafter as the gypsum rich zone 2 elevated concentrations of uranium were associated with the vadose zone i e above the median water table to the south of 8 4s referred to hereafter as the vadose rich zone and 3 elevated concentrations of uranium were associated with organic carbon below the median water table level to the southeast of 8 4s referred to hereafter as the organic rich zone fig 2 in addition to the eight borings eight new groundwater monitoring wells were installed throughout the zones to better characterize the aqueous geochemistry as follows 1 wells 121 and 120 in the gypsum rich zone 2 wells 110 117 and 118 in the vadose rich zone and 3 wells 100 106 and 108 in the organic rich zone fig 1 the results of preliminary groundwater and river water sampling indicated that the groundwater in each of the three zones contained elevated levels of chloride uranium vanadium gypsum rich zone only alkalinity calcium and magnesium as compared to the river water whereas ph was slightly lower table 1 the wells were installed using a direct push drill rig and are constructed of schedule 40 polyvinyl chloride casing and pre packed screens 0 010 inch slotted well 117 was completed in the unsaturated zone with a screen length of five feet whereas the remaining wells were completed in the saturated zone with screen lengths of five feet wells 121 120 110 118 100 and 108 or one foot well 106 wells 121 and 120 are 0 75 inches in inside diameter whereas the remaining wells are 1 5 inches in inside diameter all wells were completed with a sand pack 20 40 mesh around the screened interval that extended approximately two feet above the top of the screens and with a bentonite clay seal above the sand pack to approximately one foot bgs finally all wells were completed at the surface with one foot thick concrete seal and a three foot stick up that was protected by an outer steel casing 2 2 natural non added and artificial added tracers several tracers were used to characterize mass transport mechanisms e g advection mechanical dispersion molecular diffusion sorption and reactivity table 2 chloride was used as a natural non added conservative tracer during each test due to its natural contrast of concentrations between the injection river and aquifer groundwater fluids table 1 to characterize non reactive mass transport e g advection mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion table 2 chloride along with other halides e g bromide and iodide have been traditionally used to characterize non reactive mass transport and remain popular as conservative tracers today davis et al 1980 hu and moran 2005 therefore the halides of bromide and iodide were also used but as artificial added conservative tracers table 2 pentafluorobenzoate pfb and 2 6 di fluorobenzoate dfb were used as artificial conservative tracers to characterize mass transport of solutes from mobile to immobile zones due to molecular diffusion i e matrix diffusion in the aquifer table 2 the aqueous diffusion co efficients of pfb and dfb are approximately three times less as compared to bromide and iodide bowman and gibbens 1992 and similar contrasts in the diffusivity of non reactive tracers have been used to characterize matrix diffusion in numerous previous studies callahan et al 2000 hu and brusseau 1995 reimus et al 2003 salve et al 2004 if matrix diffusion occurred it would be expected that pfb and dfb would have a higher maximum concentration relative to its injection concentration during early arrival times as compared to bromide and iodide and that bromide and iodide would demonstrate sustained concentrations during late arrival times commonly referred to as tailing as compared to pfb and dfb lithium was used as an artificial non conservative tracer to characterize sorption by cation exchange table 2 lithium is a relatively weak sorbing tracer by cation exchange to clay and zeolite minerals anghel et al 2002 newman et al 1991 sullivan et al 2003 uranium u in its plus six oxidation state u vi much like lithium is also a sorbing tracer by cation exchange to clay and zeolite minerals bachmaf and merkel 2011 camacho et al 2010 therefore sorption of lithium to clays in the aquifer may be a proxy for sorption of u vi if sorption occurred it would be expected that the mean arrival time of lithium would be later as compared to non reactive tracers with similar aqueous diffusion co efficients e g bromide and iodide however it should be noted that sorption of u vi is highly dependent on ph and alkalinity dangelmayr et al 2017 um et al 2007 2 naphthalene sulfonate ns was used as an artificial non conservative tracer to characterize sorption to organic matter table 2 2 naphthalene sulfonate ns is a relatively strong sorbing tracer to activated carbon chang et al 2003 uranium u in its plus six oxidation state u vi much like ns is also a relatively strong sorbing species to activated carbon mellah et al 2006 therefore sorption of ns to carbon bearing species in the aquifer e g organic matter may be a proxy for sorption of u vi if sorption occurred it would be expected that the mean arrival time of ns would be later as compared to non reactive tracers with similar aqueous diffusion co efficients e g pfb and dfb however as previously stated sorption of u vi is highly dependent on ph and alkalinity all artificial anionic tracers were added to the injection fluid river water as sodium salts except for bromide which was added as lithium bromide table 2 chloride and bromide were quantified by ion chromatography ic using a dionex aquion equipped with an electrical conductivity ec detector iodide pfb dfb and ns were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography hplc using a thermo scientific ultimate 3000 equipped with an ultra violet uv detector set at a wavelength of 223 nanometers nm for iodide and 222 nm for pfb dfb and ns lithium uranium and vanadium were quantified by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes using a perkin elmer optima 7000 set at wavelengths of 610 362 385 958 and 290 880 nm for lithium uranium and vanadium respectively uranium was also quantified by kinetic phosphorescence analysis kpa using a chemcheck kpa 11 set at an excitation wavelength of 425 nm and an emission wavelength of 515 nm ns was quantified by fluorimetry using a shimadzu rf 5301pc spectrofluorophotometer set to excitation wavelength of 222 nm and an emission wavelength of 338 nm 2 3 single well push pull tests single well push pull tests were conducted in wells 121 and 120 gypsum rich zone 110 vadose rich zone and 106 organic rich zone figs 1 and 2 according to the general methodology of istok 2013 the push phase of the tests consisted of a forced gradient injection of a known volume of river water containing a known mass of artificial added tracers followed by the injection of artificial tracer free river water commonly referred to as chase water into a single well table 3 the push phase was followed by a period of non pumping to allow the injection fluid to transport in the aquifer under natural gradient conditions commonly referred to as the drift phase the pull phase of the tests consisted of a forced gradient extraction of water comprised of a mixture of the injection fluid river water and aquifer fluid groundwater from the same well the concentrations of the natural non added artificial added and reactive analytes e g uranium and vanadium were quantified in the injection aquifer and extraction fluids and used to generate concentration verses time profiles i e breakthrough curves during the extraction phase the injection volumes were selected to interrogate a volume of the aquifer that was representative of macroscopic scale flow and transport processes and the chase volumes were selected to clear the standing well volumes of artificial tracers table 3 the injection rates were selected to be high enough to complete the injection within a 24 hour period yet low enough to avoid substantial mounding of the water table table 3 the drift times were selected to be long enough to allow the tracers to migrate under natural gradient conditions that were representative of ambient flow yet short enough to recover enough mass of the tracers to allow for reliable data analysis and interpretation table 3 the extraction rates were set equal to the injection rates and the extraction volumes were selected to be high enough to recover enough mass of tracers yet low enough to mitigate the costs of waste water disposal table 3 2 4 cross hole injection extraction tests cross hole injection extraction tests were conducted in well pairs 118 110 and 117 110 vadose rich zone and 108 100 organic rich zone figs 1 and 2 and in a similar manner as the single well push pull tests the injection phase of the tests consisted of a forced gradient injection of a known volume of river water containing a known mass of artificial added tracers followed by the injection of artificial tracer free river chase water into the injection well table 4 the injection phase was accompanied by a forced gradient extraction of water comprised of a mixture of the injection fluid river water and aquifer fluid groundwater from the extraction well the concentrations of the natural non added artificial added and reactive analytes e g uranium and vanadium were quantified in the injection aquifer and extraction fluids and used to generate breakthrough curves during the extraction phase the injection and extraction volumes and rates of the cross hole tests were selected to be similar to the push pull tests tables 3 and 4 2 5 data analysis the data from the single well push pull and cross hole tests were analyzed according to the general methodology of paradis et al 2019 the expected concentration of a reactive analyte e g uranium vanadium due to dilution between the injection and aquifer fluids during the extraction phase was calculated as given by 1 c e r t c e c t c a c c i c c a c c i r c a r c a r where c e r t expected concentration of reactive analyte in the extraction fluid due to dilution ce c t concentration of non reactive conservative tracer in the extraction fluid ca c concentration of non reactive conservative tracer in the aquifer fluid ci c concentration of non reactive conservative tracer in the injection fluid ci r concentration of reactive analyte in the injection fluid ca r concentration of reactive analyte in the aquifer fluid equation 1 assumes that the mass transport characteristics of both the conservative tracer and reactive analyte are no different therefore any difference between the expected concentration of the reactive analyte c e r t and the measured concentration of the reactive analyte c e r t in the extraction fluid was attributed to one or more mass transport characteristics other than dilution furthermore the recovery factor of the reactive analyte during the extraction phase which indicates either a net addition greater than 1 net removal less than 1 or no change equal to 1 with respect to the aqueous phase was calculated as given by 2 r 0 t c e r t dt 0 t c e r t dt where r recovery factor dimensionless 0 t c e r t dt area under the measured concentration versus time data during the extraction phase 0 t c e r t dt area under the expected concentration versus time data during the extraction phase the integrals in equation 2 were estimated numerically using the trapezoidal rule as given by 3 r n 2 n c e r t n 1 c e r t n 2 t n t n 1 n 2 n c e r t n 1 c e r t n 2 t n t n 1 where n time point of the concentration data n final time point of the concentration data 3 results and discussion 3 1 single well push pull tests 3 1 1 artificial added tracers pfb and iodide the concentrations of pfb and iodide relative to their injected concentrations c co versus their extracted volume relative to their injected volume v vo during the extraction phase were nearly identical among each of the four tests fig 3 the percent mass recoveries of pfb and iodide during the extraction phase were also nearly identical among each of the four tests and ranged from 81 to 102 table 5 the percent mass recoveries in exceedance of 100 were likely due to error propagation resulting from uncertainties in the following 1 injection volume 2 extraction rate and 3 numerical integration of the relative concentration versus relative volume data these results demonstrated that the mass transport characteristics of pfb and iodide were nearly identical under the test conditions however minor tailing of iodide was observed for well 120 at relative concentrations below approximately 0 05 or 5 fig 3 and suggested that some matrix diffusion occurred the drift time for well 120 was relatively long 8 days as compared to the other tests 1 7 to 2 9 days table 3 and matrix diffusion is well known to be time dependent i e matrix diffusion increases with time maloszewski and zuber 1985 therefore it is possible that some time dependent matrix diffusion occurred in well 120 nevertheless these results strongly suggested that matrix diffusion was negligible to minor in the saturated zones of the gypsum rich vadose rich and organic rich zones 3 1 2 natural non added conservative tracer chloride the breakthrough curves of measured chloride during the extraction phase were initially at or very near the concentration of the injection fluid and gradually approached that of the aquifer fluid as time increased for each of the four tests fig 4 however the breakthrough curve of chloride for well 120 approached a concentration slightly less 20 mg l less than the aquifer fluid fig 4 as mentioned in the previous section the drift time for well 120 was relatively long as compared to the other tests table 3 moreover the concentration of chloride in the aquifer was measured immediately prior to the injection phase and was assumed to be constant over the time period of the tests therefore it is possible that the concentration of chloride in the aquifer fluid within the immediate vicinity of well 120 which was sampled discretely from a relatively small volume prior to the injection phase was notably higher than in the larger vicinity of well 120 which was continuously sampled during the larger volume extraction phase due to the heterogeneous nature of the aquifer nevertheless the natural contrast of concentrations of chloride between the injection river and aquifer groundwater fluids and its breakthrough curves indicated that it could be used to represent non reactive conservative transport during the tests finally it should be noted that the breakthrough curves of measured versus expected i e due to dilution between the injection and aquifer fluids chloride were identical and thus the recovery factors of chloride were equal to one as defined by equations 1 2 and 3 and quantitatively defined no net addition or removal from the aqueous phase fig 4 3 1 3 uranium and vanadium the breakthrough curves of measured versus expected uranium were not identical among each of the four tests during the extraction phase fig 5 these results indicated that the mass transport characteristics of chloride and uranium were not identical the measured concentration of uranium exceeded the expected concentration of uranium for wells 121 and 120 and resulted in recovery factors greater than one fig 5 these results indicated that a net addition of uranium from the aquifer to the extraction fluid groundwater river water mixture occurred for wells 121 and 120 in the gypsum rich zone the mechanisms responsible for the mobilization of uranium were likely dissolution of uranium bearing minerals and or desorption due to the natural contrast in the geochemistry between the river water and groundwater for example the concentration of uranium and cations that are common in uranium bearing minerals e g potassium calcium and magnesium in the river water tends to be consistently lower as compared to the groundwater from well 8 4s doe 2016 and would likely favor dissolution of uranium bearing minerals similarly the ph of the river water tends to be consistently higher as compared to the groundwater from well 8 4s doe 2016 and would likely desorb and mobilize solid phase oxidized uranium u vi singh et al 2014 another possible mechanism for the mobilization of uranium in wells 121 and 120 i e the gypsum rich zone figs 1 and 2 was dissolution of uranium bearing gypsum in the saturated zone for example lin et al 2018 demonstrated that u vi in the form of uranyl uo2 2 was the dominant species at the calcium ca2 site on synthetic gypsum over a range in ph from 6 5 to 9 5 the measured concentration of uranium was similar to the expected concentration of uranium for wells 110 and resulted in recovery factor nearly equal to one fig 5 these results indicated that no net addition or removal of uranium from the aquifer to the extraction fluid groundwater river water mixture occurred for well 110 in the saturated zone these results were expected given that uranium is associated with the vadose zone in the vicinity of well 110 figs 1 and 2 as opposed to the saturated zone of which well 110 was completed in contrast the measured concentration of uranium exceeded the expected concentration of uranium for well 106 and resulted in a recovery factor greater than one fig 5 these results indicated that a net addition of uranium from the aquifer to the extraction fluid groundwater river water mixture occurred for well 106 in the organic rich zone the mechanism responsible for the mobilization of uranium was likely desorption from organic rich sediments the measured concentration of vanadium exceeded the expected concentration of vanadium for wells 121 and 120 and resulted in recovery factors much greater than one fig 6 interestingly vanadium was not detectable 0 04 mg l in either the injection or aquifer fluids in well 120 yet vanadium was measured at concentrations of approximately 0 2 mg l in the extraction fluid fig 6 these results indicated that a net addition of vanadium from the aquifer to the extraction fluid groundwater river water mixture occurred for wells 121 and 120 in the gypsum rich zone the mechanisms responsible for the mobilization of vanadium were likely dissolution of vanadium uranium bearing minerals and or desorption due to the natural contrast in the geochemistry between the river water and groundwater in contrast vanadium was not detectable 0 04 mg l in the injection aquifer and extraction fluids in wells 110 and 106 fig 6 these results indicated that no net addition or removal of vanadium from the aquifer to the extraction fluid groundwater river water mixture occurred for wells 110 and 106 in the vadose rich and organic rich zones respectively in summary both uranium and vanadium were mobilized in wells 121 and 120 in the gypsum rich zone whereas only uranium was mobilized in well 106 in the organic rich zone and neither uranium nor vanadium was mobilized in well 110 in the vadose rich zone these results demonstrated that recharge of river water mobilized uranium in the saturated zones where uranium was known to exist e g the gypsum rich and organic rich zones figs 1 and 2 moreover these results demonstrated that recharge of river water mobilized vanadium in the saturated zones where vanadium was not detectable in neither injection nor aquifer fluids e g well 120 in the gypsum rich zone figs 1 and 2 as previously stated the mechanisms responsible for the mobilization of uranium and possibly vanadium were likely dissolution and or desorption however it should be noted that dissolution of uranyl bearing gypsum was also a possible mechanism for the mobilization of uranium in the gypsum rich zone i e wells 121 and 120 3 2 cross hole injection extraction tests 3 2 1 artificial added tracers pfb dfb iodide bromide lithium and ns the relative concentrations of pfb and iodine versus the relative volume during the extraction phase were nearly identical for the injection extraction well pair 118 110 fig 7 the percent mass recoveries of pfb and iodide during the extraction phase were also nearly identical for the injection extraction well pair 118 110 35 table 6 these results demonstrated that the mass transport characteristics of pfb and iodide were nearly identical under the test conditions and that matrix diffusion was likely negligible in the saturated zone between well pair 118 110 in the vadose rich zone figs 1 and 2 the relative concentrations of dfb and bromide versus the relative volume during the extraction phase were nearly identical for the injection extraction well pair 117 110 fig 7 the percent mass recoveries of dfb and bromide during the extraction phase were also nearly identical for the injection extraction well pair 117 110 8 0 and 6 4 respectively table 6 these results demonstrated that the mass transport characteristics of dfb and bromide were nearly identical under the test conditions and that matrix diffusion was likely negligible in the unsaturated to saturated zones between well pair 117 110 in the vadose rich zone figs 1 and 2 however the relative concentration of lithium versus relative volume during the extraction phase was substantially less than dfb and bromide fig 7 as was the percent mass recovery of lithium 0 055 table 6 these results demonstrated that the mass transport characteristics of lithium as compared to dfb and bromide were not identical under the test conditions the mechanism responsible for the immobilization of lithium was likely sorption by cation exchange due to cation sites on the aquifer materials being devoid of lithium prior to its injection as a tracer as evident by lithium concentrations that were not detectable in neither the aquifer nor river water prior to lithium addition data not shown the relative concentrations of dfb bromide and ns versus the relative volume during the extraction phase were very similar for the injection extraction well pair 108 100 fig 7 the percent mass recoveries of dfb bromide and ns during the extraction phase were also similar for the injection extraction well pair 108 100 45 41 and 38 respectively table 6 these results demonstrated that the mass transport characteristics of dfb bromide and ns were similar under the test conditions and that matrix diffusion and sorption to organics were likely negligible in saturated zones between well pair 108 100 in the organic rich zone figs 1 and 2 however it should be noted the relative concentration of ns decreased substantially as compared to dfb and bromide during a period of non pumping data not shown and suggested that sorption of ns occurred during natural gradient conditions figs 1 and 2 the relative concentration of lithium versus relative volume during the extraction phase was substantially less than dfb and bromide fig 7 as was the percent mass recovery of lithium 9 8 table 6 these results demonstrated that the mass transport characteristics of lithium as compared to dfb and bromide were not identical under the test conditions as was the case for injection extraction well pair 117 110 the mechanism responsible for the immobilization of lithium was likely sorption by cation exchange finally the double humped shape of the relative concentration versus relative volume during the extraction phase for the injection extraction well pair 108 100 fig 7 deserves a brief explanation a series of borehole dilution tests were conducted in well 100 prior to the tracer tests and suggested that well 100 was screened across two discrete flow zones an upper zone of low specific discharge and a lower zone of high specific discharge data not shown therefore the mass transport through the zones of high and low specific discharge are likely represented by the first and second humps respectively fig 7 3 2 2 natural non added conservative tracer chloride the breakthrough curves of measured chloride during the extraction phase were initially at or very near the concentration of the aquifer fluid and gradually decreased as time increased for each of the three tests fig 8 the natural contrast of concentrations of chloride between the injection river and aquifer groundwater fluids and its breakthrough curves indicated that it could be used to represent non reactive conservative transport during the tests 3 2 3 uranium and vanadium the breakthrough curves of measured versus expected uranium were not identical among each of the three tests in the extraction wells fig 9 these results indicated that the mass transport characteristics of chloride and uranium were not identical the measured concentration of uranium exceeded the expected concentration of uranium for each of the three tests and resulted in recovery factors greater than one fig 9 these results indicated that a net addition of uranium from the aquifer to the extraction fluid groundwater river water mixture occurred for the two tests in the vadose rich zone and the one test in the organic rich zone figs 1 and 2 the mechanism responsible for the mobilization of uranium in the saturated zones was likely desorption due to the natural contrast in the geochemistry between the river water and groundwater however an additional mechanism responsible for the mobilization of uranium in the vadose rich zone was likely flushing of residual mass from the unsaturated to the saturated zone vanadium was not detectable 0 04 mg l in the injection aquifer and extraction fluids in the extraction wells data not shown these results indicated that no net addition or removal of vanadium from the aquifer to the extraction fluid groundwater river water mixture occurred for the extraction wells in summary uranium and not vanadium was mobilized in the extraction wells 110 and 100 in the vadose rich and organic rich zones these results demonstrated that recharge of river water mobilized uranium in the unsaturated and saturated zones where uranium was known to exist figs 1 and 2 as previously stated the mechanisms responsible for the mobilization of uranium were likely desorption in the saturated zones due to the natural contrast in the geochemistry between the river water and groundwater and flushing of residual mass from the unsaturated zone 4 conclusions the recharge of river water to the unsaturated and saturated zones of a uranium contaminated aquifer was simulated in a series of forced gradient single and multi well injection extraction tracer tests the breakthrough curves of tracers with dissimilar aqueous diffusion co efficients were nearly identical and indicated that matrix diffusion was negligible however the breakthrough curves of tracers known to sorb by cation exchange and to organic carbon behaved non conservatively and indicated that desorption was a potential mass transport mechanism uranium was mobilized in the unsaturated and saturated zones where uranium was known to be associated with gypsum the vadose zone and organic carbon whereas vanadium was mobilized only in the saturated zone associated with gypsum the natural contrast in the geochemistry of the river water and groundwater likely resulted in the dissolution of uranium and vanadium bearing minerals and or desorption from the saturated zones moreover flushing of residual mass from the unsaturated zone likely resulted in the mobilization of uranium the results of this study provided field scale and direct evidence that the recharge of native surface water to hydraulically connected groundwater can mobilize uranium and vanadium and resulted in a revised site conceptual model to reflect these important findings fig 10 the results of this study implied that natural recharge and flooding events of surface water to groundwater at former mill tailing sites will mobilize uranium and possibly vanadium and contribute to persistent levels of groundwater contamination finally the results of this study will inform the development of a site wide reactive transport model to further elucidate the mass transport mechanisms of uranium and vanadium during natural recharge and flooding events and to simulate their long term concentrations in the aquifer declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

faster removal velocity as well zeta potential and potentiometric titration results revealed that bscs generated more negative charges and sites concentration after addition of nano tio2 at acidic environment the carboxyl and amino hydroxyl groups were the main functional groups on bsc and the bsc tio2 the higher concentration of amino hydroxyl groups in bsc tio2 0 33 0 08 mmol g was present than that of pristine bscs 0 62 0 02 mmol g and they were with similar concentration of phosphate groups and carboxyl groups this result was attributed to the nano tio2 stimulated the bscs to produce

community structure and succession in dry lands belnap and gillette 1998 chilton et al 2014 irrigation water is the dominant source of heavy metal pollution in paddy soil li et al 2017 stream beds lake and rice fields bscs may therefore play an important role in the adsorption accumulation and even mineralization of heavy metals in irrigation water recent developments in nanotechnology have led to a considerable increase in its utilization in the agricultural environmental and industrial sectors brar et al 2010 mihalache et al 2016 among commercialized nanomaterials titanium dioxide engineered nanoparticles nano tio2 are one of the most widely used auffan et al 2017 according to reports the annual output of tio2 is about 10 000 tons at present by 2025 the annual output is expected to reach 2 5 million tons yang et al 2012 it is inevitable that some of these nanomaterials will enter the environment thus potentially affecting the ecological environment and human health pini et al 2016 tang et al reported that the exposure of periphyton to iron oxide nanoparticles leads to a more compact structure increased levels of chlorophyll a b and c and decreased total antioxidant capacity tang et al 2017a the exposure of freshwater biofilms to various nano tio2 and uv radiation was found to elicit various lipid peroxidation and toxic effects and increase the total extracellular polymeric substance eps levels qian et al 2017 furthermore the exposure of periphytic biofilms to nano tio2 for four days was found to lead to changes in the community structure of the biofilms liu et al 2017 these result revealed that the nanomaterial would change both the chemical components and biological community for microorganism system nano tio2 could enhance the heavy metal bioaccumulation for various organisms nano tio2 had a significantly stronger adsorption capacity for cd than natural sediment particles sp in waterbody the presence of sp did not have significant influence on the accumulation of cd in carp during the 25 d of exposure however the presence of nano tio2 greatly enhanced the accumulation of cd in carp zhang et al 2007 the nano tio2 act as a

nano tio2 can improve the action of nitrate reductase to change inorganic forms of nitrogen no3 n and nh4 n into an organic form yang et al 2006 these results indicate that nano tio2 has potential application prospects in biological removal of heavy metals bscs possess the ability to accumulate heavy metals and engineered nanoparticles the bscs have been shown to remove cd and cu from irrigation water with adsorption capacities for cd and cu of up to 236 29 mg kg and 342 42 mg kg respectively yang et al 2016 the equilibrium adsorption capacity of a biofilm for nano tio2 under acidic conditions was found to be enhanced by 40 compared with that under neutral conditions because of the electric interaction sahle demessie and tadesse 2011 the adsorption capacity of periphyton for cuo nanoparticles was reported to be 62 4 mg g at ph 5 miao et al 2015 however the effect of nanomaterial on metal ion removal by the bsc was rare in this paper the effect of nanoparticles on the removal of heavy metals by bscs was explored especially under acidic irrigation water as some ph of irrigation water is lower than 5 0 even to 4 0 in widespread area of south china by the strong acid deposition effect and then the heavy metal captured mechanism by the pure bscs and in present of the nano tio2 was investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 bsc sample collection and reagents the bscs

weight using a vacuum freezer the moisture content was calculated from the difference between the wet and dry weights this step was performed in triplicate and the values were averaged the bscs

similar as above except the initial cd ii concentration the initial cd ii concentration was set as 10 30 50 80 100 120 140 180 mg l after equilibration the suspensions were centrifuged at 12 000 gfor 10 min and the cd ii in the supernatant was determined using atomic absorption spectroscopy varian techtron pty ltd victoria australia the amount of adsorbed cd ii was calculated from the difference between the initial cd ii concentration and the residual concentration after sorption to study the cd ii adsorption isotherms on bscs nano tio2 and the bsc tio2 composite the adsorption data were fitted using the langmuir and freundlich models as expressed by eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 q e q m bc e 1 bc e 2 q e k f c e 1 n where q e is the amount of adsorbate c e is the equilibrium concentration of adsorbate q max is the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent k l is a constant parameter related to the adsorption energy k f is a parameter related to the relative adsorption

research guibaud et al 2006 the suspensions were centrifuged at 12 000 g for 10 min the supernatant was taken to determine the content of suspended cadmium the remaining biomass was resuspended in edta 4 mm for 20 min to remove metals directly bound to cell walls or metals bound to eps tightly associated with cells meylan et al 2003 after centrifugation the supernatant including edta exchangeable metals was digested the biomass was subsequently resuspended and centrifuged with 10 mm mops solution to remove any residuary metal edta complexes analyzed for metal content and included in calculations for metals relevant to the sorbed fraction the metal content in the remaining biomass operationally defined the non edta exchangeable fraction all fractions were digested appropriately thinned and metal concentration of the digests was detected using icp optima 8300 icp oes spectrometer perkinelmer 2 4 characterization method the samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 6380lv jeol tokyo japan and the element mapping quanta250 usa the ir spectroscopy was performed using a perkinelmer spectrum 65 ft ir spectrometer usa 2 5 zeta potential measurements and potentiometric titrations the zeta potential was determined before and after the adsorption of cd ii on bscs nano tio2 and the bsc tio2 composite at ph 4 using an electrophoresis method js94h shanghai power reach co ltd china acid base titrations were performed according to a procedure described in the literature yee et al 2004 the suspensions of bscs nano tio2 and their composite were placed under a n2 atmosphere at 25 cand then titrated with 0 1 m naoh and0 5 m hcl solutions a known amount of hcl was added at the beginning of the experiment to lower the ph to approximately 2 5 the composites were equilibrated for 40 min and then titrated to ph 10 with naoh the background value was titrated with the same treatment using deionised h2o subsequently a non electrostatic model was used to fit the potentiometric titration data the pk a total adsorption sites and site concentration were calculated using fiteql4 laine et al 1994 2 6 determination of extracellular polysaccharides ep and proteins the polysaccharide and protein concentrations of the supernatants from the different samples ph 4 were determined using the phenol method and the coomassie brilliant blue method respectively four sets of experiments were performed using bscs bsc tio2 bsc cd ii and bsc cd ii tio2 the amount of adsorbent and adsorbate were set in every sample and presented as follow 0 3 g bsc 0 75 mg tio2 and 50 mg l cd ii in 30 ml solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of bscs nano tio2 and bsc tio2 the sem results for the samples at ph 4 are shown in fig 1 the sem images reveal that the bscs sample fig 1a contained a large number of biological organisms with numerous filaments and pores some microorganism such as spirogyra and blue green algae was shown these filaments and minerals were incorporated in the eps which was secreted from the microorganism the granular nano tio2 was found to aggregated in the fig 1b with size of 30 100 nm in diameter the bsc tio2 was shown in the fig 1c and its magnification image in fig 1d it was clearly revealed the nano tio2 was dispersed on the bscs surface and some embedded in the eps the amount of eps in bsc tio2 was higher than that of pure bscs because the former surface was displayed more flat this observation indicated that the nano tio2 stimulated the eps secretion from microorganism previous studies have suggested that eps are one of the most important components of bscs miao et al 2015 it has also been shown that zno nps can be adsorbed into biofilms and biofilms secrete eps for physical protection and can trap nps in the eps matrix hou et al 2014 after the release of eps by bacteria nps aggregate in the biofilms owing to the presence of eps choi et al 2010 thus eps may as one of the main reasons for the accumulation of nano tio2 on the bscs surface the amount of c o n si and al were 50 00at 37 80at 3 97at 2 84at 1 53at as the main elements in the bsc tio2 detected with eds fig 1e the presence of ti 0 57 at element indicated that the nano tio2 was incorporated in bscs since the bscs was without any ti element 3 2 adsorption characteristics under different ph conditions and zeta potential measurements the influence of ph on the adsorption of cd ii by bscs nano tio2 and the bsc tio2 composite was shown in the fig 2a the adsorption of cd ii increased with increasing ph for all two samples and the adsorption of cd ii by tio2 alone had the same result fig s1 in the ph range of 3 4 the addition of nano tio2 to bscs increases the adsorption capacity of bscs the adsorption capacity of bsc tio2 increased by 23 78 at ph 3 and 26 70 at ph 4 compared to pure bscs in the ph range of 5 8 the addition of nano tio2 had almost no effect on the adsorption of cd ii by bscs these results indicate that nano tio2 promotes the adsorption of cd ii by bscs at acidic environment below of ph 5 but has no obvious promoting effect under the ph range of 5 8 these results might be attributed to the stronger interaction between bsc and nano tio2 at low ph than that of high ph the zetal potential of tio2 and bsc was negative at neutral ph and then with lower negative charge as decrease of ph the lower charge on the surface can induce stronger interaction between the nano tio2 and bscs as the ph value increases the competition of h ions for binding sites decreases resulting in enhancing the adsorption of heavy metal ions on the adsorbent afkhami and moosavi 2010 under neutral conditions the addition of nano tio2 had no effect on the adsorption of cd ii on bscs this result is consistent with the previous observation that the addition of nano tio2 did not increase the adsorption of cu by epiphytic biofilms liu et al 2017 however it was also found that under mildly acidic conditions the adsorption of cd ii on the bsc tio2 composite was higher than that on pure bscs therefore to further explore the adsorption of cd ii on bscs after adding nano tio2 at ph 4 the zeta potentials were measured before and after the adsorption of cd ii on bscs nano tio2 and the bsc tio2 composite the results are shown in the fig 2b the zeta potentials of bscs nano tio2 and the bsc tio2 composite prior to adsorption were 2 36 12 11 and 17 42 mv respectively in addition the zeta potentials after adsorption were 1 57 8 21 and 4 52 mv respectively prior to adsorption the zeta potential of the bsc tio2 composite was lower than that of any single components i e bscs and nano tio2 this result may be related to that the addition of nano tio2 causes the bscs to produce some products with high negatively charged such as ep proteins etc it has previously been reported that under the stress of ionps epiphytic biofilms produced large amounts of eps to construct a barrier between cells and ionps tang et al 2017b the similar result was reported by liu et al 2017 in which the nano tio2 enhances the eps secretion of biofilm to reduce its toxicity li et al 2017 the eps usually obtain a large of anionic groups and reveal negative charged after adsorption the zeta potential of all the samples was with less negative charged than that of before adsorption it is related to that the cd ii adsorbed neutralized the negative charged of adsorbents however the bscs was less negative than that of the bsc tio2 composite because the adsorption capacity of pure bscs for cd ii is less than that of the bsc tio2 composite this observation may be attributed to nano tio2 increasing the number of adsorption site of bscs under mildly acidic conditions to clear the number of the adsorption site for bsc tio2 bscs and nano tio2 their detail chemisorptive sites number would be measured using adsorption isotherms method 3 3 adsorption isotherms two adsorption isotherm models namely the freundlich and langmuir models were used to fit the adsorption data the langmuir isotherm model is commonly used to describe adsorption processes based on the assumption that adsorption occurs at single specific sites on the adsorbent the freundlich model is an empirical equation based on adsorption on heterogeneous sites kuang et al 2016 as shown in fig 3 and table 1 the adsorption data for bscs nano tio2 and the bsc tio2 composite at ph 4 exhibited a good fit with the langmuir model with maximum sorption capacities q m of 9 87 mg g 7 68 mg g and 10 13 mg g respectively the correlation coefficients r 2 for the langmuir model were higher than those for the freundlich model thus the langmuir model was more suitable for describing the adsorption isotherms of cd ii on bscs nano tio2 and the bsc tio2composite than the freundlich model the q m was corresponding to the number of chemisorptive site of adsorbent in langmuir model the q m of bsc 0 3 g was calculated as 9 87 mg g however the q m of bsc tio2 was 10 13 mg g this result indicates that the addition of nano tio2 increases the adsorption and adsorption of cadmium by bscs 3 4 adsorption kinetics the influence of the contact time on the adsorption of cd ii on bscs nano tio2 and the bsc tio2 composite at ph 4 is presented in fig s2 the adsorption of cd ii on the bsc tio2 composite was more rapid than that on pure bsc in the first 30 min the cd ii adsorption by nano tio2 wasextremelyrapid and equilibrium adsorption was reached within 240 s two models was used to analyze the adsorption kinetics and their results were shown in fig s2 and table s1 the second order kinetic model was better fit in the adsorption kinetics of cd ii the correlation coefficients r 2 were 0 92 0 98 and 0 92 for bscs nano tio2 and the bsc tio2 composite respectively the k 2 of bscs nano tio2 and the bsc tio2 was 0 029 min 1 0 089 min 1 and 0 032 min 1 with respect to the 50 mg l cd ii respectively the adsorption of cd ii by nano tio2 was quicker than that of bscs velinov et al 2017 the adsorption rate for the bsc tio2 composite was faster than that for pure bscs in the first 30 min which may be attributable to the high adsorption rate of nano tio2 meanwhile this result indicated that the some cd ii were first trapped with nano tio2 which were not incorporated with the eps in bsc tio2 composite 3 5 distribution of cd in order to further explore the increase in the adsorption amount of cd ii after the addition of tio2 at ph 4 the distribution of cd ii in bsc was detected the result is shown in fig 4 obviously when the ph was 4 the eps sorbed non edta exchangeable fractions have increased especially sorbed fraction and non edta exchangeable fraction are the major increase the content of cd ii was increased by 0 13 mg and 0 05 mg respectively at ph 4 the distribution of cd ii has changed after nano tio2 was added the amounts of cd ii adsorbed in the biosurface were respectively 1 52 and 1 96 mg g for bsc and bsc tio2 furthermore the non edta exchangeable cd were 0 48 and 0 64 mg g the cd ii was thus mainly distributed in the adsorbed fraction therefore we speculate that under mildly acidic conditions the addition of tio2 allows bscs to produce more secretions for example biomass capsular eps and proteins thereby more cadmium can be adsorbed the increase of the non edta exchangeable fraction may be due to the increased permeability of bscs cell membrane under mildly acidic conditions tarhanen et al 1999 after adsorption of cd ii by nano tio2 it is easier to into the bscs through the similar trojan horse effect than cadmium alone mihalache et al 2016 3 6 determination of ep protein concentrations in order to find out whether the stimulation of nano tio2 bscs obtained a higher concentration of functional groups the details of eps were analyzed four sets of experiments were performed using bsc bsc tio2 bsc cd and bsc cd tio2 all the sets were taken for 6 h equilibration and then the supernatants were taken and the ep and protein concentrations were measured separately the results are shown in fig 5 the ep concentrations of the bsc bsc tio2 bsc cd and bsc cd tio2 samples were 3 12 μg g 8 27 μg g 26 74 μg g and 20 78 μg g respectively and that the extracellular protein concentrations of the bsc bsc tio2 bsc cd and bsc cd tio2 samples were 0 02 mg g 0 031 mg g 0 11 mg g and 0 06 mg g respectively the composition of the eps matrix varies widely depending on its origin and the local environment the total eps content may be divided into different classes of macromolecules including polysaccharides often 40 95 proteins up to 60 and small amounts of nucleic acids lipids and other biopolymers flemming and wingender 2001 therefore numerous anionic functional groups are present in eps such as carboxyl phosphoryl sulfhydryl phenolic and hydroxyl groups which participate in cation exchange and therefore form complexes with heavy metals gupta and diwan 2017 proteins polysaccharides carbohydrates and nucleic acids in eps all have the ability to complex with heavy metals more et al 2014 yin et al 2011 as shown in fig 6 the bsc can produce higher level of ep and proteins in presence of cd ii and nano tio2 than that of any single cd ii or nano tio2 because ep production is a significant mechanism that contributes to bacterial heavy metal resistance chien et al 2013 it also plays an important role in reducing the toxicity of nps by affecting their penetration into cells and transformation tang et al 2017a it has previously been reported that after adding nano tio2 to biofilms eps species especially proteins were overproduced to bind the nps and thereby reduce their nanotoxicity liu et al 2017 this result is consistent with the zeta potential assumption in fig 2 b this indicates that the zeta potential of bsc tio2 is higher than that of bsc because tio2 can stimulate bscs to secrete more eps the elemental distribution mapping results fig 6 further confirm this mechanism the capture of cd ii by the bsc tio2 composite was analyzed by elemental distribution mapping to reveal that the distribution of cd ii was very similar to that of o n and ti this indicates that the adsorption of cd ii by bsc is related to the o n containing substances and nano tio2 similarity the nano tio2 was artificially added and then induced a large amount of eps contain o n in biofilms liu et al 2013 therefore the combination of cd ii and nano tio2 caused a synergistic effect on bsc resulting in greater levels of eps 3 7 potentiometric titrations potentiometric titrations reflect the adsorption sites and their concentration on the surfaces of both organisms and minerals ams et al 2004 tourney et al 2008 the value of v y reflects the confidence of the deduced adsorption site concentration and pk a generally the deduced value was reasonable with the v y 20 buerge weirich et al 2003 the titration results for bscs nano tio2 and the bsc tio2 composite are shown in fig 7 bscs nano tio2 and their composite exhibited substantial buffering behavior and the weak inflection points on the titration curves indicate the deprotonation of various functional groups the results of fitting the potentiometric titration data are shown in table 2 the fitting results revealed that bscs possessed three distinct adsorption sites with pk a values of 3 87 0 64 7 08 0 23 and 9 23 0 61 the bsc tio2 composite was also found to possess three adsorption sites with pk a values of 4 57 0 47 6 94 0 21 and 9 01 0 38 the functional groups present on bacterial surfaces have been divided into three types fein et al 1997 where pk a values of 4 6 approximately 7 and 8 11 correspond to carboxyl groups phosphate groups and amino hydroxyl groups respectively this result is consistent with the fourier transformed infrared ftir result fig s3 the site concentration of amino hydroxyl was 0 33 0 08 mmol g and 0 62 0 02 mmol g for bscs and bsc tio2 respectively the site concentration of carboxyl and phosphate groups did not change much in addition the total site concentrations of bsc and bsc tio2 were 0 72 0 15 and 1 05 0 09 mmol g respectively it was noted that the site concentration was higher for the bsc tio2 composite than for bscs it has previously been reported that the removal of eps from bacterial cells only reduces the site concentration but does not change the nature of the functional group species on bacterial surfaces fang et al 2010 therefore we speculate that this result is due to the fact that nano tio2 stimulates bscs to produce more eps which is consistent with the results of previous ep and extracellular protein measurements the increase in eps leads to an increase in the concentration of the adsorption point the site concentration of carboxyl and amino hydroxyl was 4 57 0 24 10 3 mmol g and 4 09 0 07 10 2 mmol g for nano tio2 respectively the site concentration for nano tio2 was much lower than that for bscs even if its adsorption capacity was higher than that of bscs it is inferred that the coulomb interactions was one main adsorption mechanism except the chemisorptions for the nano tio2 capture the cd ii the site concentration for bsc tio2 was higher than that of bscs this result is consistent with the results of ep and extracellular protein measurements of bsc and bsc tio2 therefore we speculate that the nano tio2 stimulating the bscs to produce more extracellular polysaccharides and proteins thereby increasing the removal effect of bscs on cd ii consequently at a ph 4 the addition of 0 75 mg of nano tio2 was found to promote the production of 3 48 μg of ep and 0 05 mg of extracellular protein from 1 0 g of bscs because our measured eps was the slime and loosely bound eps their amount was only about 50 of total eps therefore we reasonably inferred that the cd ii adsorption capacity of these new produced eps was as much as 40 75 mg g which far exceeds the cd ii adsorption capacity of pristine bsc with low amount of eps peng et al 2019 it is meant the eps was the main contribution to capture heavy metal in bscs anyhow our research demonstrated that the nano tio2 can stimulate the bscs to produce more eps including ep and extracellular protein etc and then enhance the bind site concentration to heavy metal cd ii this result would be applied on the paddy field system especially where the nonmaterial and heavy metal ion coexist these nonmaterial and heavy metal ions would be synergistic removal by the bscs in acidic conditions factually the ph of the irrigation water was very low in some area of southern china such as ore iron and brenstone mineral area as low as 3 4 feng et al 2004 therefore this technology would be required in widely area 4 conclusions the influence of nano tio2 on the removal of cd ii on bscs under acidic irrigation water was investigated after the addition of nano tio2 the adsorption rate of cd ii for bscs increased faster in the first 30 min and the adsorption capacity of pure bscs increased by 26 70 the results of isotherm and kinetic models indicate that the adsorption of cd ii by bsc tio2 was more consistent with the langmuir model and the pseudo second order kinetic model zeta potential and potentiometric titration results revealed that bscs generates more negative charges and an increased concentration of adsorption sites which result from the nano tio2 stimulating the bscs to produce more extracellular polysaccharides and proteins our findings provide new strategy for

to a considerable increase in its utilization in the agricultural environmental and industrial sectors brar et al 2010 mihalache et al 2016 among commercialized nanomaterials titanium dioxide engineered nanoparticles nano tio2 are one of the most widely used auffan et al 2017 according to reports the annual output of tio2 is about 10 000 tons at present by 2025 the annual output is expected to reach 2 5 million tons yang et al 2012 it is inevitable that some of these nanomaterials will enter the environment thus potentially affecting the ecological environment and human health pini et al 2016 tang et al reported that the exposure of periphyton to iron oxide nanoparticles leads to a more compact structure increased levels of chlorophyll a b and c and decreased total antioxidant capacity tang et al 2017a the exposure of freshwater biofilms to various nano tio2 and uv radiation was found to elicit various lipid peroxidation and toxic effects and increase the total extracellular polymeric substance eps levels qian et al 2017 furthermore the exposure of periphytic biofilms to nano tio2 for four days was found to lead to changes in the community structure of the biofilms liu et al 2017 these result revealed that the nanomaterial would change both the chemical components and biological community for microorganism system nano tio2 could enhance the heavy metal bioaccumulation for various organisms nano tio2 had a significantly stronger adsorption capacity for cd than natural sediment particles sp in waterbody the presence of sp did not have significant influence on the accumulation of cd in carp during the 25 d of exposure however the presence of nano tio2 greatly enhanced the accumulation of cd in carp zhang et al 2007 the nano tio2 act as a carrier of cd to increase bioaccumulation for the ciliate tetrahymena thermophile by internalization and endocytosis two routes wei wan et al 2014 singh et al 2016 reported the application of nano tio2 can increase cd uptake and minimize cd stress in soybean plants through formation of new bonds in the plant tissue with the cd nano tio2 singh and lee 2016 furthermore nano tio2 promote spinach growth by defending the chloroplast sheath assembly from the reactive oxygen consequently improving the function of antioxi dant enzymes superoxide dismutase catalase and peroxidase gao et al 2013 nano tio2 can improve the action of nitrate reductase to change inorganic forms of nitrogen no3 n and nh4 n into an organic form yang et al 2006 these results indicate that nano tio2 has potential application prospects in biological removal of heavy metals bscs possess the ability to accumulate heavy metals and engineered nanoparticles the bscs have been shown to remove cd and cu from irrigation water with adsorption capacities for cd and cu of up to 236 29 mg kg and 342 42 mg kg respectively yang et al 2016 the equilibrium adsorption capacity of a biofilm for nano tio2 under acidic conditions was found to be enhanced by 40 compared with that under neutral conditions because of the electric interaction sahle demessie and tadesse 2011 the adsorption capacity of periphyton for cuo nanoparticles was reported to be 62 4 mg g at ph 5 miao et al 2015 however the effect of nanomaterial on metal ion removal by the bsc was rare in this paper the effect of nanoparticles on the removal of heavy metals by bscs was explored especially under acidic irrigation water as some ph of irrigation water is lower than 5 0 even to 4 0 in widespread area of south china by the strong acid deposition effect and then the heavy metal captured mechanism by the pure bscs and in present of the nano tio2 was investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 bsc sample collection and reagents the bscs sample used was collected from rice fields 28 18 93 24 n 113 09 26 15 e at hunan agricultural university changsha china the bscs samples were weighed vacuum filtered and then dried to a constant weight using a vacuum freezer the moisture content was calculated from the difference between the wet and dry weights this step was performed in triplicate and the values were averaged the bscs

similar as above except the initial cd ii concentration the initial cd ii concentration was set as 10 30 50 80 100 120 140 180 mg l after equilibration the suspensions were centrifuged at 12 000 gfor 10 min and the cd ii in the supernatant was determined using atomic absorption spectroscopy varian techtron pty ltd victoria australia the amount of adsorbed cd ii was calculated from the difference between the initial cd ii concentration and the residual concentration after sorption to study the cd ii adsorption isotherms on bscs nano tio2 and the bsc tio2 composite the adsorption data were fitted using the langmuir and freundlich models as expressed by eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 q e q m bc e 1 bc e 2 q e k f c e 1 n where q e is the amount of adsorbate c e is the equilibrium

capacity of the adsorbent in the freundlich model and the parameter n reflects the affinity between the adsorbent and adsorbate the adsorption kinetics experiment was conducted with the same conditions ph of effect experiment and extra 1 0 ml solution was extracted to analyze the cd ii concentration on sorption times of 5 10 20 30 60 120 240 360 min the adsorption rate constants for cd ii were determined by pseudo first and second order model kinetics equations as expressed by eqs 3 and 4 respectively 3 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where q e is the amount of

research guibaud et al 2006 the suspensions were centrifuged at 12 000 g for 10 min the supernatant was taken to determine the content of suspended cadmium the remaining biomass was resuspended in edta 4 mm for 20 min to remove metals directly bound to cell walls or metals bound to eps tightly associated with cells meylan et al 2003 after centrifugation the supernatant including edta exchangeable metals was digested the biomass was subsequently resuspended and centrifuged with 10 mm mops solution to remove any residuary metal edta complexes analyzed for metal content and included in calculations for metals relevant to the sorbed fraction the metal content in the remaining biomass operationally defined the non edta exchangeable fraction all fractions were digested appropriately thinned and metal concentration of the digests was detected using icp optima 8300 icp oes spectrometer perkinelmer 2 4 characterization method the samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 6380lv jeol tokyo japan and the element mapping quanta250 usa the ir spectroscopy was performed using a perkinelmer spectrum 65 ft ir spectrometer usa 2 5 zeta potential measurements and potentiometric titrations the zeta potential was determined before and after the adsorption of cd ii on bscs nano tio2 and the bsc tio2 composite at ph 4 using an electrophoresis method js94h shanghai power reach co ltd china acid base titrations were performed according to a procedure described in the literature yee et al 2004 the suspensions of bscs nano tio2 and their composite were placed under a n2 atmosphere at 25 cand then titrated with 0 1 m naoh and0 5 m hcl solutions a known amount of hcl was added at the beginning of the experiment to lower the ph to approximately 2 5 the composites were equilibrated for 40 min and then titrated to ph 10 with naoh the background value was titrated with the same treatment using deionised h2o subsequently a non electrostatic model was used to fit the potentiometric titration data the pk a total adsorption sites and site concentration were calculated using fiteql4 laine et al 1994 2 6 determination of extracellular polysaccharides ep and proteins the polysaccharide and protein concentrations of the supernatants from the different samples ph 4 were determined using the phenol method and the coomassie brilliant blue method respectively four sets of experiments were performed using bscs bsc tio2 bsc cd ii and bsc cd ii tio2 the amount of adsorbent and adsorbate were set in every sample and presented as follow 0 3 g bsc 0 75 mg tio2 and 50 mg l cd ii in 30 ml solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of bscs nano tio2 and bsc tio2 the sem results for the samples at ph 4 are shown in fig 1 the sem images reveal that the bscs sample fig 1a contained a large number of biological organisms with numerous filaments and pores some microorganism such as spirogyra and blue green algae was shown these filaments and minerals were incorporated in the eps which was secreted from the microorganism the granular nano tio2 was found to aggregated in the fig 1b with size of 30 100 nm in diameter the bsc tio2 was shown in the fig 1c and its magnification image in fig 1d it was clearly revealed the nano tio2 was dispersed on the bscs surface and some embedded in the eps the amount of eps in bsc tio2 was higher than that of pure bscs because the former surface was displayed more flat this observation indicated that the nano tio2 stimulated the eps secretion from microorganism previous studies have suggested that eps are one of the most important components of bscs miao et al 2015 it has also been shown that zno nps can be adsorbed into biofilms and biofilms secrete eps for physical protection and can trap nps in the eps matrix hou et al 2014 after the release of eps by bacteria nps aggregate in the biofilms owing to the presence of eps choi et al 2010 thus eps may as one of the main reasons for the accumulation of nano tio2 on the bscs surface the amount of c o n si and al were 50 00at 37 80at 3 97at 2 84at 1 53at as the main elements in the bsc tio2 detected with eds fig 1e the presence of ti 0 57 at element indicated that the nano tio2 was incorporated in bscs since the bscs was without any ti element 3 2 adsorption characteristics under different ph conditions and zeta potential measurements the influence of ph on the adsorption of cd ii by bscs nano tio2 and the bsc tio2 composite was shown in the fig 2a the adsorption of cd ii increased with increasing ph for all two samples and the adsorption of cd ii by tio2 alone had the same result fig s1 in the ph range of 3 4 the addition of nano tio2 to bscs increases the adsorption capacity of bscs the adsorption capacity of bsc tio2 increased by 23 78 at ph 3 and 26 70 at ph 4 compared to pure bscs in the ph range of 5 8 the addition of nano tio2 had almost no effect on the adsorption of cd ii by bscs these results indicate that nano tio2 promotes the adsorption of cd ii by bscs at acidic environment below of ph 5 but has no obvious promoting effect under the ph range of 5 8 these results might be attributed to the stronger interaction between bsc and nano tio2 at low ph than that of high ph the zetal potential of tio2 and bsc was negative at neutral ph and then with lower negative charge as decrease of ph the lower charge on the surface can induce stronger interaction between the nano tio2 and bscs as the ph value increases the competition of h ions for binding sites decreases resulting in enhancing the adsorption of heavy metal ions on the adsorbent afkhami and moosavi 2010 under neutral conditions the addition of nano tio2 had no effect on the adsorption of cd ii on bscs this result is consistent with the previous observation that the addition of nano tio2 did not increase the adsorption of cu by epiphytic biofilms liu et al 2017 however it was also found that under mildly acidic conditions the adsorption of cd ii on the bsc tio2 composite was higher than that on pure bscs therefore to further explore the adsorption of cd ii on bscs after adding nano tio2 at ph 4 the zeta potentials were measured before and after the adsorption of cd ii on bscs nano tio2 and the bsc tio2 composite the results are shown in the fig 2b the zeta potentials of bscs nano tio2 and the bsc tio2 composite prior to adsorption were 2 36 12 11 and 17 42 mv respectively in addition the zeta potentials after adsorption were 1 57 8 21 and 4 52 mv respectively prior to adsorption the zeta potential of the bsc tio2 composite was lower than that of any single components i e bscs and nano tio2 this result may be related to that the addition of nano tio2 causes the bscs to produce some products with high negatively charged such as ep proteins etc it has previously been reported that under the stress of ionps epiphytic biofilms produced large amounts of eps to construct a barrier between cells and ionps tang et al 2017b the similar result was reported by liu et al 2017 in which the nano tio2 enhances the eps secretion of biofilm to reduce its toxicity li et al 2017 the eps usually obtain a large of anionic groups and reveal negative charged after adsorption the zeta potential of all the samples was with less negative charged than that of before adsorption it is related to that the cd ii adsorbed neutralized the negative charged of adsorbents however the bscs was less negative than that of the bsc tio2 composite because the adsorption capacity of pure bscs for cd ii is less than that of the bsc tio2 composite this observation may be attributed to nano tio2 increasing the number of adsorption site of bscs under mildly acidic conditions to clear the number of the adsorption site for bsc tio2 bscs and nano tio2 their detail chemisorptive sites number would be measured using adsorption isotherms method 3 3 adsorption isotherms two adsorption isotherm models namely the freundlich and langmuir models were used to fit the adsorption data the langmuir isotherm model is commonly used to describe adsorption processes based on the assumption that adsorption occurs at single specific sites on the adsorbent the freundlich model is an empirical equation based on adsorption on heterogeneous sites kuang et al 2016 as shown in fig 3 and table 1 the adsorption data for bscs nano tio2 and the bsc tio2 composite at ph 4 exhibited a good fit with the langmuir model with maximum sorption capacities q m of 9 87 mg g 7 68 mg g and 10 13 mg g respectively the correlation coefficients r 2 for the langmuir model were higher than those for the freundlich model thus the langmuir model was more suitable for describing the adsorption isotherms of cd ii on bscs nano tio2 and the bsc tio2composite than the freundlich model the q m was corresponding to the number of chemisorptive site of adsorbent in langmuir model the q m of bsc 0 3 g was calculated as 9 87 mg g however the q m of bsc tio2 was 10 13 mg g this result indicates that the addition of nano tio2 increases the adsorption and adsorption of cadmium by bscs 3 4 adsorption kinetics the influence of the contact time on the adsorption of cd ii on bscs nano tio2 and the bsc tio2 composite at ph 4 is presented in fig s2 the adsorption of cd ii on the bsc tio2 composite was more rapid than that on pure bsc in the first 30 min the cd ii adsorption by nano tio2 wasextremelyrapid and equilibrium adsorption was reached within 240 s two models was used to analyze the adsorption kinetics and their results were shown in fig s2 and table s1 the second order kinetic model was better fit in the adsorption kinetics of cd ii the correlation coefficients r 2 were 0 92 0 98 and 0 92 for bscs nano tio2 and the bsc tio2 composite respectively the k 2 of bscs nano tio2 and the bsc tio2 was 0 029 min 1 0 089 min 1 and 0 032 min 1 with respect to the 50 mg l cd ii respectively the adsorption of cd ii by nano tio2 was quicker than that of bscs velinov et al 2017 the adsorption rate for the bsc tio2 composite was faster than that for pure bscs in the first 30 min which may be attributable to the high adsorption rate of nano tio2 meanwhile this result indicated that the some cd ii were first trapped with nano tio2 which were not incorporated with the eps in bsc tio2 composite 3 5 distribution of cd in order to further explore the increase in the adsorption amount of cd ii after the addition of tio2 at ph 4 the distribution of cd ii in bsc was detected the result is shown in fig 4 obviously when the ph was 4 the eps sorbed non edta exchangeable fractions have increased especially sorbed fraction and non edta exchangeable fraction are the major increase the content of cd ii was increased by 0 13 mg and 0 05 mg respectively at ph 4 the distribution of cd ii has changed after nano tio2 was added the amounts of cd ii adsorbed in the biosurface were respectively 1 52 and 1 96 mg g for bsc and bsc tio2 furthermore the non edta exchangeable cd were 0 48 and 0 64 mg g the cd ii was thus mainly distributed in the adsorbed fraction therefore we speculate that under mildly acidic conditions the addition of tio2 allows bscs to produce more secretions for example biomass capsular eps and proteins thereby more cadmium can be adsorbed the increase of the non edta exchangeable fraction may be due to the increased permeability of bscs cell membrane under mildly acidic conditions tarhanen et al 1999 after adsorption of cd ii by nano tio2 it is easier to into the bscs through the similar trojan horse effect than cadmium alone mihalache et al 2016 3 6 determination of ep protein concentrations in order to find out whether the stimulation of nano tio2 bscs obtained a higher concentration of functional groups the details of eps were analyzed four sets of experiments were performed using bsc bsc tio2 bsc cd and bsc cd tio2 all the sets were taken for 6 h equilibration and then the supernatants were taken and the ep and protein concentrations were measured separately the results are shown in fig 5 the ep concentrations of the bsc bsc tio2 bsc cd and bsc cd tio2 samples were 3 12 μg g 8 27 μg g 26 74 μg g and 20 78 μg g respectively and that the extracellular protein concentrations of the bsc bsc tio2 bsc cd and bsc cd tio2 samples were 0 02 mg g 0 031 mg g 0 11 mg g and 0 06 mg g respectively the composition of the eps matrix varies widely depending on its origin and the local environment the total eps content may be divided into different classes of macromolecules including polysaccharides often 40 95 proteins up to 60 and small amounts of nucleic acids lipids and other biopolymers flemming and wingender 2001 therefore numerous anionic functional groups are present in eps such as carboxyl phosphoryl sulfhydryl phenolic and hydroxyl groups which participate in cation exchange and therefore form complexes with heavy metals gupta and diwan 2017 proteins polysaccharides carbohydrates and nucleic acids in eps all have the ability to complex with heavy metals more et al 2014 yin et al 2011 as shown in fig 6 the bsc can produce higher level of ep and proteins in presence of cd ii and nano tio2 than that of any single cd ii or nano tio2 because ep production is a significant mechanism that contributes to bacterial heavy metal resistance chien et al 2013 it also plays an important role in reducing the toxicity of nps by affecting their penetration into cells and transformation tang et al 2017a it has previously been reported that after adding nano tio2 to biofilms eps species especially proteins were overproduced to bind the nps and thereby reduce their nanotoxicity liu et al 2017 this result is consistent with the zeta potential assumption in fig 2 b this indicates that the zeta potential of bsc tio2 is higher than that of bsc because tio2 can stimulate bscs to secrete more eps the elemental distribution mapping results fig 6 further confirm this mechanism the capture of cd ii by the bsc tio2 composite was analyzed by elemental distribution mapping to reveal that the distribution of cd ii was very similar to that of o n and ti this indicates that the adsorption of cd ii by bsc is related to the o n containing substances and nano tio2 similarity the nano tio2 was artificially added and then induced a large amount of eps contain o n in biofilms liu et al 2013 therefore the combination of cd ii and nano tio2 caused a synergistic effect on bsc resulting in greater levels of eps 3 7 potentiometric titrations potentiometric titrations reflect the adsorption sites and their concentration on the surfaces of both organisms and minerals ams et al 2004 tourney et al 2008 the value of v y reflects the confidence of the deduced adsorption site concentration and pk a generally the deduced value was reasonable with the v y 20 buerge weirich et al 2003 the titration results for bscs nano tio2 and the bsc tio2 composite are shown in fig 7 bscs nano tio2 and their composite exhibited substantial buffering behavior and the weak inflection points on the titration curves indicate the deprotonation of various functional groups the results of fitting the potentiometric titration data are shown in table 2 the fitting results revealed that bscs possessed three distinct adsorption sites with pk a values of 3 87 0 64 7 08 0 23 and 9 23 0 61 the bsc tio2 composite was also found to possess three adsorption sites with pk a values of 4 57 0 47 6 94 0 21 and 9 01 0 38 the functional groups present on bacterial surfaces have been divided into three types fein et al 1997 where pk a values of 4 6 approximately 7 and 8 11 correspond to carboxyl groups phosphate groups and amino hydroxyl groups respectively this result is consistent with the fourier transformed infrared ftir result fig s3 the site concentration of amino hydroxyl was 0 33 0 08 mmol g and 0 62 0 02 mmol g for bscs and bsc tio2 respectively the site concentration of carboxyl and phosphate groups did not change much in addition the total site concentrations of bsc and bsc tio2 were 0 72 0 15 and 1 05 0 09 mmol g respectively it was noted that the site concentration was higher for the bsc tio2 composite than for bscs it has previously been reported that the removal of eps from bacterial cells only reduces the site concentration but does not change the nature of the functional group species on bacterial surfaces fang et al 2010 therefore we speculate that this result is due to the fact that nano tio2 stimulates bscs to produce more eps which is consistent with the results of previous ep and extracellular protein measurements the increase in eps leads to an increase in the concentration of the adsorption point the site concentration of carboxyl and amino hydroxyl was 4 57 0 24 10 3 mmol g and 4 09 0 07 10 2 mmol g for nano tio2 respectively the site concentration for nano tio2 was much lower than that for bscs even if its adsorption capacity was higher than that of bscs it is inferred that the coulomb interactions was one main adsorption mechanism except the chemisorptions for the nano tio2 capture the cd ii the site concentration for bsc tio2 was higher than that of bscs this result is consistent with the results of ep and extracellular protein measurements of bsc and bsc tio2 therefore we speculate that the nano tio2 stimulating the bscs to produce more extracellular polysaccharides and proteins thereby increasing the removal effect of bscs on cd ii consequently at a ph 4 the addition of 0 75 mg of nano tio2 was found to promote the production of 3 48 μg of ep and 0 05 mg of extracellular protein from 1 0 g of bscs because our measured eps was the slime and loosely bound eps their amount was only about 50 of total eps therefore we reasonably inferred that the cd ii adsorption capacity of these new produced eps was as much as 40 75 mg g which far exceeds the cd ii adsorption capacity of pristine bsc with low amount of eps peng et al 2019 it is meant the eps was the main contribution to capture heavy metal in bscs anyhow our research demonstrated that the nano tio2 can stimulate the bscs to produce more eps including ep and extracellular protein etc and then enhance the bind site concentration to heavy metal cd ii this result would be applied on the paddy field system especially where the nonmaterial and heavy metal ion coexist these nonmaterial and heavy metal ions would be synergistic removal by the bscs in acidic conditions factually the ph of the irrigation water was very low in some area of southern china such as ore iron and brenstone mineral area as low as 3 4 feng et al 2004 therefore this technology would be required in widely area 4 conclusions the influence of nano tio2 on the removal of cd ii on bscs under acidic irrigation water was investigated after the addition of nano tio2 the adsorption rate of cd ii for bscs increased faster in the first 30 min and the adsorption capacity of pure bscs increased by 26 70 the results of isotherm and kinetic models indicate that the adsorption of cd ii by bsc tio2 was more consistent with the langmuir model and the pseudo second order kinetic model zeta potential and potentiometric titration results revealed that bscs generates more negative charges and an increased concentration of adsorption sites which result from the nano tio2 stimulating the bscs to produce more extracellular polysaccharides and proteins our findings provide new strategy for the use of bscs to remove heavy metals under mildly acidic environments declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no financial and personal relationships with other people or

1539,chlorinated solvents like trichloroethylene tce and tetrachloroethylene pce are prevalent groundwater contaminants being detected more than half of the superfund sites they are introduced into the subsurface due to improper disposal of hazardous wastes containing these chlorinated dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapl dnapl wastes sink in the subsurface and form pools on clay layers further transport into the underlying clay layer is dominated by diffusion due to the low permeability of these soils and results in accumulation of contaminants therein overtime through diffusion however field evidence reported that mass storage of solvents in such zones was higher than what can be attributed to simple diffusion to evaluate this finding mass storage of tce in a hypothetical aquitard after 30 years of diffusion was calculated the diffusion coefficient reported in the field study resulted in mass storage of 137 7 g in this hypothetical aquitard whereas the mass calculated using the measured diffusion coefficient of tce from pure solvent into water saturated clayey soil was 25 65 of it 35 0 89 4 g the calculated mass storage was even lower 8 2 g if the measured diffusion coefficient of tce from dnapl waste into waste contacted soil was used so mass of tce accumulated through sole diffusion was not able to explain the one observed in the field this excess mass in the field might be the mass of dnapl entered into the cracks which were reported to form in clay layers as a result of the direct contact between water saturated clay and dnapl waste mass of tce in the cracks was calculated using reported average crack size and an assumed crack depth and it appeared that cracks filled with dnapl could increase the stored mass up to a minimum of 334 g which could easily account for the enhanced mass storage observed in the field keywords dnapls hazardous waste site clay layers diffusion cracks mass accumulation 1 introduction hazardous waste produced by processes such as degreasing and dry cleaning was often disposed of directly to the land surface leading to the infiltration of chlorinated solvents like trichloroethylene tce and tetrachloroethylene pce into the subsurface because of their widespread use these compounds are two of the most common organic contaminants found at superfund sites serdp and estcp 2006 and are also frequently found in domestic wells at concentrations above the maximum contaminant level mcl moran et al 2007 solvent wastes that are predominantly tce or pce are often referred to as dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls as they are sparingly soluble in water and their density is greater than that of water therefore they tend to sink as a separate organic liquid phase through the groundwater column once they reach low permeability lenses or layers they spread laterally forming pools over time the contamination in these pools dissolves moving downgradient through advection as a dissolved plume in addition it is thought that that the contamination moves into the low permeability lenses and layers through diffusion with these zones potentially accumulating a significant mass over time goodall and quigley 1977 johnson et al 1989 after the initial pool of dnapl has been removed these zones release the accumulated mass back to the surrounding groundwater through back diffusion greatly increasing the lifetime of the contamination problem sale et al 2008 stroo et al 2012 since diffusion is considered to be the dominant transport process into and out of low permeable layers the mass accumulation of the chlorinated compounds in aquitards is calculated based on rates of diffusion mackay and cherry 1989 ball et al 1997 wilson 1997 chapman and parker 2005 parker et al 2008 ayral and demond 2014 reviewed measured diffusion coefficients for tce and found that in general they ranged from 0 21 10 6 to 1 37 10 6 cm2 s for clayey materials depending on the state of compaction of the clayey soil ayral cinar and demond 2017 reported values of 1 3 10 6 cm2 s and 0 7 10 6 cm2 s for tce which gave relative diffusivities comparable to iodide in the same porous media yet in the field the diffusion coefficient may be lower as the diffusion coefficient for tce in a silt clay sample that had been in contact with dnapl waste for eighteen months was measured to be 1 1 10 8 cm2 s calculations of mass accumulation based on representative diffusion coefficients may however underestimate what is observed in the field for example the report released by the air force center for engineering and the environment stated that in a large scale tank experiment the process of mass transfer into low permeability zones and rebound both through molecular diffusion and advection was evaluated the area of the interface between the high and low permeability formations in this experiment was 550 cm2 that is much lower than the value of 1680 cm2 in the first experiment a comparison of the breakthrough curve of this experiment with that of the first experiment suggests high attenuation of the dissolved mass hence this increased mass attenuation even with a lower interface area can be attributed to advection contributing to the mass transfer into the silt sale et al 2007 so this report highlighted that detected amounts of contaminants in some clay layers may be higher than what can be attributed to diffusion alone similarly ball et al 1997 examined field data for an unweathered clay landfill liner in southwestern ontario and related that the effective diffusion rates for organic compounds such as benzene tce toluene and ethylbenzene were 1 6 to 5 times higher than those based on the relative diffusivity of chloride the explanation offered was that perhaps the increased values were due to preferential pathways for diffusion posed by fissures or cracks mott and weber jr 1991 this evidence of larger than expected mass storage in clay layers relative to estimates based on diffusion rates suggests that additional mechanisms may serve to transport contaminants into these zones advective transport into these layers is generally deemed to be small relative to diffusive transport as the hydraulic gradients and the permeability of these layers are low liu and ball 2002 parker et al 2004 yet the rates of advective transport are usually based on the assumption of a competent clay

contact of water saturated bentonite clay with dnapl field waste resulted in cracking within a time frame of less than a year with aperture sizes up to 1 mm since cracks may be present naturally or may form due to contact with dnapl waste their impact needs to be considered in the accumulation of contamination in clayey soil zones mott and weber jr 1991 suggested that cracks might serve as

al 1985 three to four orders of magnitude li et al 1996 and one to five orders of magnitude brown and thomas 1984 were reported depending on the organic liquid clay type and percent clay thus in some clayey layers it is conceivable that advection may have increased to a point where its contribution to mass accumulation is comparable or even greater than that attributable to diffusion another

from hill air force base similarly the density of the waste may vary as hsu 2005 reported a density of 1 3 g cm3 rather than 1 46 g cm3 for a tce based waste given the altered physicochemical properties of dnapl wastes in particular the low interfacial tensions the pool heights at hazardous waste sites for example 3 0 to 7 3 m at hill afb oolman et al 1995 may be sufficient to exceed the entry pressure of cracks in the field the estimation of remediation time frames depends on estimates of mass accumulations in clay lenses and layers parker et al 2004 these estimates are usually based on diffusion into a competent clay layer however the quantity of accumulation reported in such zones in the field exceeds what might be expected if diffusion is the primary transport mechanism cracks

concentration c1 the concentration at the bottom of the clay layer c2 is equal to zero as field measurements do not show the complete penetration of aquitards by the contaminant ball et al 1997 parker et al 2004 under this constant concentration gradient the relationship between the cumulative mass that has exited the plane sheet per unit area m and time t becomes linear as time approaches infinity

steady state were taken as 0 21 10 6 and 1 37 10 6 cm2 s as these bracket the range of reported values ayral and demond 2014 accumulation over a 30 year time period was calculated as parker et al 2003 for example compiled data for five sites and found that dnapl entered the subsurface in the 1950s and 1960s with releases ending in the 1970s to the 1980s and site monitoring and clean up starting in the early 1990s the aquitard was assumed to be 5 m in thickness based on the properties of field sites presented in parker et al 2003 the aqueous phase concentration of tce for water equilibrated with a tce based dnapl waste measured in ayral cinar et al 2016 as 500 mg l so the concentration at x 0 c1 was set at 220 mg l considering porosity of the domain to be equal to 0 44 in the second scenario cracks are present fig 2 the size and distribution of cracks in the domain were based on the dimensions given by ayral et al 2014 this study reported that after 251 days of contact between water saturated bentonite and a field dnapl waste the total horizontal length of the cracks was 57 3 cm on a surface area of 78 5 cm2 to scale up it was assumed that the crack length per unit surface area 0 73 m m2 was kept constant giving a length of 7 3 103 cm on the 104 cm2 surface of the model aquitard the average aperture width was assumed to be 6 8 10 2 cm as reported by ayral et al 2014 the depth of the cracks was not reported in this study with the exception of one vertical crack which was observed to extend about 0 5 cm deep based on this the crack depth was taken as 0 5 cm using the average aperture size total length and assumed depth 6 8 10 2 cm 7 3 103 cm and 0 5 cm respectively the total volume of the cracks was calculated as 250 cm3 in order to provide a more comprehensive range for the volume of cracks other studies in the literature reporting crack dimensions were reviewed and the crack length per unit area seem to range from 0 9 and 1 8 m m2 tang et al 2011 tang et al 2012 so an appropriate range for crack volume appeared to be 30 62 cm3 in the domain with 0 5 cm deep cracks over a surface area of 1 m2 furthermore the ratio of crack area to surface area was reported to range between 0 093 and 0 242 tang et al 2008 tang et al 2011 tang et al 2012 if this ratio was used to calculate crack volume in the modeled domain surface area of 1 m2 and crack depth of 0 5 cm the projected volume of cracks would increase to 465 1210 cm3 although the cracks were reported to form polygons with varying apertures velde 1999 tang et al 2008 li and zhang 2010 tang et al 2011 tang et al 2012 in this study the cracks were assumed to be circular with an aperture size set equal to the average aperture width in an open packing configuration as illustrated in fig 2a n circular soil matrices were assigned to each side of the surface area of the aquitard so the total number of total circular soil matrices in 1 m2 aquitard equaled to n 2 based also on this assumption the sum of the n circles diameter equaled 1 m one side of the surface area of the aquitard furthermore the cracks were assumed to be around and between the openly packed circles so the total perimeter of n 2 circles equaled total crack length of 73 m as a result the number of circles for an area of 1 m2 rounded to 529 and each circle had a diameter of 4 35 cm in the second scenario considering cracks in the aquitard the mass accumulation of tce was calculated with the assumption that dnapl did not enter into cracks directly rather the cracking resulted in advective transport of tce as a solute into the cracks the mass storage in this scenario then would have three components mass accumulated due to diffusion into a plane sheet from the top surface mass accumulated due to advection into the cracks and mass accumulated due to diffusion from the cracks into the cylindrical clay matrix fig 2 the mass per unit area due to diffusion from the top surface was calculated in the same manner as in the first scenario neglecting the horizontal surface area of the cracks the mass storage due to advection into the cracks was calculated by assuming that at t 30 years the distance travelled by the advective front was at least 0 5 cm indeed dissolved tce would have travelled at least 200 m in 30 years applying the cubic law for flow bear 1972 in a 6 8 10 2 cm wide fracture with the hydraulic gradient of 0 01 reported by chapman and parker 2005 for a waste site in connecticut thus the mass storage due to advection into cracks was computed using the dissolved tce concentration of 220 mg l and the volume of the cracks at small times the mass entering a cylindrical soil matrix can be calculated by eq 4 crank 1975 4 m t m 4 π 1 2 d e t r 2 1 2 d e t r 2 1 3 π 1 2 d e t r 2 3 2 where mt is the total amount of diffusing substance per unit area which enters the cylinder in time t r is the radius of the cylinder and m is defined by 5 m r 1 2 c s where cs is the initial uniform concentration at the surface of the cylinder set equal to the concentration at the upper boundary of the aquitard of 220 mg l assuming that the clay matrix is composed of cylinders with a radius of 4 35 cm m is achieved in less than a year as the mass storage calculations presented here are based on 30 year time frame in this study the value of m was used as the mass per surface area in one cylinder due to diffusion thus the total mass accumulated due to diffusion from the cracks was calculated by multiplying the value of m by the surface area of each cylinder and the total number of cylinders 529 the third scenario takes into account the possible infiltration of dnapl into the cracks based on the physicochemical data from hsu 2005 for a tce waste retrieved at hill afb interfacial tension was taken as 3 dyn cm density as 1 30 g cm3 and the contact angle as 30o hsu 2005 the median aperture size was assumed to be 680 μm ayral et al 2014 based on these values it was determined that the depth of pooling necessary for free phase dnapl to enter a crack of this aperture was only 0 6 cm as this pool height is well below reported dnapl pool heights the entrance of dnapl into such cracks is a distinct possibility in the case of entry into cracks the mass accumulation would consist of three components mass accumulation due to diffusion from the top surface mass accumulation due to diffusion from the cracks into the clay matrix and dnapl present in the cracks the amount of mass accumulation for the first two components was already calculated in the first two scenarios the third component was calculated by multiplying the volume of the cracks by the density of the tce field dnapl 3 results and discussion the results of mass storage calculations for the three scenarios considered are summarized in table 1 using the slower diffusion rate of tce through a silt clay mixture contacted with dnapl waste 1 14 10 8 cm2 s the estimated mass that accumulated in the aquitard 8 2 g was found to be 17 times smaller than that based on field observations 137 7 g moreover even using the effective diffusion coefficients reported in the literature 0 21 10 6 1 37 10 6 cm2 s resulted in a mass storage of between 35 and 89 g still considerably smaller than the mass accumulation of 137 7 g calculated based on the observed diffusion coefficient in the field of 3 25 10 6 cm2 s these results suggest that transport rates in the field cannot be attributed solely to diffusion into a competent clay layer alone and it is necessary to consider other mechanisms of transport in the second scenario where transport into the hypothetical aquitard as in fig 2 the mass diffused into the aquitard from the top surface was considered to be the same as the mass accumulation calculated for the first scenario 35 89 g for the effective diffusion coefficient range of 0 21 1 37 10 6 cm2 s the accumulated mass due to advective flow into cracks was 0 06 g if the volume of the cracks was taken as 250 cm3 but it could be as large as 0 27 g if the volume of cracks was calculated to be 1213 cm3 based on the crack area to surface area ratio reported by tang et al 2008 the third component of mass storage was due to tce diffusion from the crack into the cylindrical soil matrices between cracks equal to 0 86 g table 1 thus the overall mass accumulation in the second scenario would be in the range of 35 9 90 5 g depending on the diffusion coefficient and the crack volume used this value is only 1 3 higher than the mass attributed to diffusion into a plane sheet and fails to explain the mass storage of 137 7 g in the aquitard based on the diffusion coefficient reported by johnson et al 1989 as the results of the second scenario could not explain the enhanced mass storage in the field a third scenario in which the dnapl phase entered into the cracks was considered the additional mass accumulation due to the presence of free phase dnapl in the cracks is 325 g even if the conservative volume of cracks suggested in this study 250 cm3 was used table 1 thus the total mass stored in the aquitard increased to least up to 361 415 g using the effective diffusion coefficient of 0 21 10 6 cm2 s and 1 37 10 6 cm2 s respectively despite the fact that the diffusion coefficient obtained in the lab for a clay silt mixture contacted with dnapl waste ayral cinar and demond 2017 was two orders of magnitude smaller than the one obtained in the field the mass storage was now almost one third of the mass observed in the field if the volume of cracks is as high as that projected by the crack area to surface area ratio it is likely that mass storage could be above 1 kg 1613 1667 g these results imply that the high diffusion rates observed in the field may be attributable to small scale cracking in the clay lenses or aquitards and may be considered as evidence that diffusion is not the sole transport mechanism into clay layers in the field 4 conclusions measured diffusion coefficients of tce in the literature grathwohl 1998 khandelwal et al 1998 itakura et al 2003 are lower than the diffusion coefficient estimates used in field studies ball et al 1997 parker et al 2004 and the diffusion coefficient observed in the field johnson et al 1989 the impact of the different diffusion coefficients on mass storage was estimated through hypothetical calculations of the mass storage of tce in a model aquitard it was concluded that mass storage estimates determined using diffusion coefficients measured in the lab were 25 65 of that mass calculated using diffusion coefficients observed in the field suggesting that there are additional mechanisms other than diffusion contributing to mass accumulation in clay layers at sites contaminated with dnapl waste the impact of cracks on mass storage was evaluated by considering two scenarios calculations of the increase in diffusion due to cracks assuming that the contaminants enter the cracks as a solute in the aqueous phase did not increase the mass storage significantly 1 3 however additional calculations suggested that given the size of crack apertures that may be present and the pool depths observed at hazardous waste sites dnapl could enter the cracks in this scenario the mass storage increased substantially giving estimates that could match field observations the aquitard model used in this investigation was simplified particularly in that the cracks were not modeled as connecting in the field however cracks do connect e g scott et al 1988 the interconnections of a crack network could allow the dnapl to spread through the clay layer as shown in simulations conducted by reynolds and kueper 2002 and could lead to even larger accumulations of dnapl in aquitards than that calculated here furthermore parker et al 1997 showed that diffusion from this free phase in the cracks into the surrounding matrix could result in the complete disappearance of the free phase in the cracks thus the transport out of the aquitard back into the surrounding aquifer could still be primarily diffusive in nature as assumed by sale et al 2007 for example regardless of the configuration interconnectness or the origin of the cracks naturally present or formed by contact with dnapl waste the modeling results presented here show that even small cracks could readily account for the field observations of the movement of chlorinated solvents into aquitards whereas hypothesizing the existence of increased advection coupled with diffusion still substantially underpredicts field

1539,chlorinated solvents like trichloroethylene tce and tetrachloroethylene pce are prevalent groundwater contaminants being detected more than half of the superfund sites they are introduced into the subsurface due to improper disposal of hazardous wastes containing these chlorinated dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapl dnapl wastes sink in the subsurface and form pools on clay layers further transport into the underlying clay layer is dominated by diffusion due to the low permeability of these soils and results in accumulation of contaminants therein overtime through diffusion however field evidence reported that mass storage of solvents in such zones was higher than what can be attributed to simple diffusion to evaluate this finding mass storage of tce in a hypothetical aquitard after 30 years of diffusion was calculated the diffusion coefficient reported in the field study resulted in mass storage of 137 7 g in this hypothetical aquitard whereas the mass calculated using the measured diffusion coefficient of tce from pure solvent into water saturated clayey soil was 25 65 of it 35 0 89 4 g the calculated mass storage was even lower 8 2 g if the measured diffusion coefficient of tce from dnapl waste into waste contacted soil was used so mass of tce accumulated through sole diffusion was not able to explain the one observed in the field this excess mass in the field might be the mass of dnapl entered into the cracks which were reported to form in clay layers as a result of the direct contact between water saturated clay and dnapl waste mass of tce in the cracks was calculated using reported average crack size and an assumed crack depth and it appeared that cracks filled with dnapl could increase the stored mass up to a minimum of 334 g which could easily account for the enhanced mass storage observed in the field keywords dnapls hazardous waste site clay layers diffusion cracks mass accumulation 1 introduction hazardous waste produced by processes such as degreasing and dry cleaning was often disposed of directly to the land surface leading to the infiltration of chlorinated solvents like trichloroethylene tce and tetrachloroethylene pce into the subsurface because of their widespread use these compounds are two of the most common organic contaminants found at superfund sites serdp and estcp 2006 and are also frequently found in domestic wells at concentrations above the maximum contaminant level mcl moran et al 2007 solvent wastes that are predominantly tce or pce are often referred to as dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls as they are sparingly soluble in water and their density is greater than that of water therefore they tend to sink as a separate organic liquid phase through the groundwater column once they reach low permeability lenses or layers they spread laterally forming pools over time the contamination in these pools dissolves moving downgradient through advection as a dissolved plume in addition it is thought that that the contamination moves into the low permeability lenses and layers through diffusion with these zones potentially accumulating a significant mass over time goodall and quigley 1977 johnson et al 1989 after the initial pool of dnapl has been removed these zones release the accumulated mass back to the surrounding groundwater through back diffusion greatly increasing the lifetime of the contamination problem sale et al 2008 stroo et al 2012 since diffusion is considered to be the dominant transport process into and out of low permeable layers the mass accumulation of the chlorinated compounds in aquitards is calculated based on rates of diffusion mackay and cherry 1989 ball et al 1997 wilson 1997 chapman and parker 2005 parker et al 2008 ayral and demond 2014 reviewed measured diffusion coefficients for tce and found that in general they ranged from 0 21 10 6 to 1 37 10 6 cm2 s for clayey materials depending on the state of compaction of the clayey soil ayral cinar and demond 2017 reported values of 1 3 10 6 cm2 s and 0 7 10 6 cm2 s for tce which gave relative diffusivities comparable to iodide in the same porous media yet in the field the diffusion coefficient may be lower as the diffusion coefficient for tce in a silt clay sample that had been in contact with dnapl waste for eighteen months was measured to be 1 1 10 8 cm2 s calculations of mass accumulation based on representative diffusion coefficients may however underestimate what is observed in the field for example the report released by the air force center for engineering and the environment stated that in a large scale tank experiment the process of mass transfer into low permeability zones and rebound both through molecular diffusion and advection was evaluated the area of the interface between the high and low permeability formations in this experiment was 550 cm2 that is much lower than the value of 1680 cm2 in the first experiment a comparison of the breakthrough curve of this experiment with that of the first experiment suggests high attenuation of the dissolved mass hence this increased mass attenuation even with a lower interface area can be attributed to advection contributing to the mass transfer into the silt sale et al 2007 so this report highlighted that detected amounts of contaminants in some clay layers may be higher than what can be attributed to diffusion alone similarly ball et al 1997 examined field data for an unweathered clay landfill liner in southwestern ontario and related that the effective diffusion rates for organic compounds such as benzene tce toluene and ethylbenzene were 1 6 to 5 times higher than those based on the relative diffusivity of chloride the explanation offered was that perhaps the increased values were due to preferential pathways for diffusion posed by fissures or cracks mott and weber jr 1991 this evidence of larger than expected mass storage in clay layers relative to estimates based on diffusion rates suggests that additional mechanisms may serve to transport contaminants into these zones advective transport into these layers is generally deemed to be small relative to diffusive transport as the hydraulic gradients and the permeability of these layers are low liu and ball 2002 parker et al 2004 yet the rates of advective transport are usually based on the assumption of a competent clay layer with the possibility of cracks or microfissures discounted there are multiple reports of naturally occurring cracks in subsurface layers for example d astous et al 1989 reported cracks with

al 2012 in this study the cracks were assumed to be circular with an aperture size set equal to the average aperture width in an open packing configuration as illustrated in fig 2a n circular soil matrices were assigned to each side of the surface area of the aquitard so the total number of total circular soil matrices in 1 m2 aquitard equaled to n 2 based also on this assumption the sum of the n circles diameter equaled 1 m one side of the surface area of the aquitard furthermore the cracks were assumed to be around and between the openly packed circles so the total perimeter of n 2 circles equaled total crack length of 73 m as a result the number of circles for an area of 1 m2 rounded to 529 and each circle had a diameter of 4 35 cm in the second scenario considering cracks in the aquitard the mass accumulation of tce was calculated with the assumption that dnapl did not enter into cracks directly rather the cracking resulted in advective transport of tce as a solute into the cracks the mass storage in this scenario then would have three components mass accumulated due to diffusion into a plane sheet from the top surface mass accumulated due to advection into the cracks and mass accumulated due to diffusion from the cracks into the cylindrical clay matrix fig 2 the mass per unit area due to diffusion from the top surface was calculated in the same manner as in the first scenario neglecting the horizontal surface area of the cracks the mass storage due to advection into the cracks was calculated by assuming that at t 30 years the distance travelled by the advective front was at least 0 5 cm indeed dissolved tce would have travelled at least 200 m in 30 years applying the cubic law for flow bear 1972 in a 6 8 10 2 cm wide fracture with the hydraulic gradient of 0 01 reported by chapman and parker 2005 for a waste site in connecticut thus the mass storage due to advection into cracks was computed using the dissolved tce concentration of 220 mg l and the volume of the cracks at small times the mass entering a cylindrical soil matrix can be calculated by eq 4 crank 1975 4 m t m 4 π 1 2 d e t r 2 1 2 d e t r 2 1 3 π 1 2 d e t r 2 3 2 where mt is the total amount of diffusing substance per unit area which enters the cylinder in time t r is the radius of the cylinder and m is defined by 5 m r 1 2 c s where cs is the initial uniform concentration at the surface of the cylinder set equal to the concentration at the upper boundary of the aquitard of 220 mg l assuming that the clay matrix is composed of cylinders with a radius of 4 35 cm m is achieved in less than a year as the mass storage calculations presented here are based on 30 year time frame in this study the value of m was used as the mass per surface area in one cylinder due to diffusion thus the total mass accumulated due to diffusion from the cracks was calculated by multiplying the value of m by the surface area of each cylinder and the total number of cylinders 529 the third scenario takes into account the possible infiltration of dnapl into the cracks based on the physicochemical data from hsu 2005 for a tce waste retrieved at hill afb interfacial tension was taken as 3 dyn cm density as 1 30 g cm3 and the contact angle as 30o hsu 2005 the median aperture size was assumed to be 680 μm ayral et al 2014 based on these values it was determined that the depth of pooling necessary for free phase dnapl to enter a crack of this aperture was only 0 6 cm as this pool height is well below reported dnapl pool heights the entrance of dnapl into such cracks is a distinct possibility in the case of entry into cracks the mass accumulation would consist of three components mass accumulation due to diffusion from the top surface mass accumulation due to diffusion from the cracks into the clay matrix and dnapl present in the cracks the amount of mass accumulation for the first two components was already calculated in the first two scenarios the third component was calculated by multiplying the volume of the cracks by the density of the tce field dnapl 3 results and discussion the results of mass storage calculations for the three scenarios considered are summarized in table 1 using the slower diffusion rate of tce through a silt clay mixture contacted with dnapl waste 1 14 10 8 cm2 s the estimated mass that accumulated in the aquitard 8 2 g was found to be 17 times smaller than that based on field observations 137 7 g moreover even using the effective diffusion coefficients reported in the literature 0 21 10 6 1 37 10 6 cm2 s resulted in a mass storage of between 35 and 89 g still considerably smaller than the mass accumulation of 137 7 g calculated based on the observed diffusion coefficient in the field of 3 25 10 6 cm2 s these results suggest that transport rates in the field cannot be attributed solely to diffusion into a competent clay layer alone and it is necessary to consider other mechanisms of transport in the second scenario where transport into the hypothetical aquitard as in fig 2 the mass diffused into the aquitard from the top surface was considered to be the same as the mass accumulation calculated for the first scenario 35 89 g for the effective diffusion coefficient range of 0 21 1 37 10 6 cm2 s the accumulated mass due to advective flow into cracks was 0 06 g if the volume of the cracks was taken as 250 cm3 but it could be as large as 0 27 g if the volume of cracks was calculated to be 1213 cm3 based on the crack area to surface area ratio reported by tang et al 2008 the third component of mass storage was due to tce diffusion from the crack into the cylindrical soil matrices between cracks equal to 0 86 g table 1 thus the overall mass accumulation in the second scenario would be in the range of 35 9 90 5 g depending on the diffusion coefficient and the crack volume used this value is only 1 3 higher than the mass attributed to diffusion into a plane sheet and fails to explain the mass storage of 137 7 g in the aquitard based on the diffusion coefficient reported by johnson et al 1989 as the results of the second scenario could not explain the enhanced mass storage in the field a third scenario in which the dnapl phase entered into the cracks was considered the additional mass accumulation due to the presence of free phase dnapl in the cracks is 325 g even if the conservative volume of cracks suggested in this study 250 cm3 was used table 1 thus the total mass stored in the aquitard increased to least up to 361 415 g using the effective diffusion coefficient of 0 21 10 6 cm2 s and 1 37 10 6 cm2 s respectively despite the fact that the diffusion coefficient obtained in the lab for a clay silt mixture contacted with dnapl waste ayral cinar and demond 2017 was two orders of magnitude smaller than the one obtained in the field the mass storage was now almost one third of the mass observed in the field if the volume of cracks is as high as that projected by the crack area to surface area ratio it is likely that mass storage could be above 1 kg 1613 1667 g these results imply that the high diffusion rates observed in the field may be attributable to small scale cracking in the clay lenses or aquitards and may be considered as evidence that diffusion is not the sole transport mechanism into clay layers in the field 4 conclusions measured diffusion coefficients of tce in the literature grathwohl 1998 khandelwal et al 1998 itakura et al 2003 are lower than the diffusion coefficient estimates used in field studies ball et al 1997 parker et al 2004 and the diffusion coefficient observed in the field johnson et al 1989 the impact of the different diffusion coefficients on mass storage was estimated through hypothetical calculations of the mass storage of tce in a model aquitard it was concluded that mass storage estimates determined using diffusion coefficients measured in the lab were 25 65 of that mass calculated using diffusion coefficients observed in the field suggesting that there are additional mechanisms other than diffusion contributing to mass accumulation in clay layers at sites contaminated with dnapl waste the impact of cracks on mass storage was evaluated by considering two scenarios calculations of the increase in diffusion due to cracks assuming that the contaminants enter the cracks as a solute in the aqueous phase did not increase the mass storage significantly 1 3 however additional calculations suggested that given the size of crack apertures that may be present and the pool depths observed at hazardous waste sites dnapl could enter the cracks in this scenario the mass storage increased substantially giving estimates that could match field observations the aquitard model used in this investigation was simplified particularly in that the cracks were not modeled as connecting in the field however cracks do connect e g scott et al 1988 the interconnections of a crack network could allow the dnapl to spread through the clay layer as shown in simulations conducted by reynolds and kueper 2002 and could lead to even larger accumulations of dnapl in aquitards than that calculated here furthermore parker et al 1997 showed that diffusion from this free phase in the cracks into the surrounding matrix could result in the complete disappearance of the free phase in the cracks thus the transport out of the aquitard back into the surrounding aquifer could still be primarily diffusive in nature as assumed by sale et al 2007 for example regardless of the configuration interconnectness or the origin of the cracks naturally present or formed by contact with dnapl waste the modeling results presented here show that even small cracks could readily account for the field observations of the movement of chlorinated solvents into aquitards whereas hypothesizing the existence of increased advection coupled with diffusion still substantially underpredicts field
