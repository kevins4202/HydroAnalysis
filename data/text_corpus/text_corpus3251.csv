16255,phosphorus p limitation of phytoplankton growth is increasingly common in estuarine and coastal waters due to rising anthropogenic nitrogen input faster than that of phosphorus however the impact of p limitation on coastal hypoxia remains inconclusive and is challenging to observe by combining observations with results from a three dimensional physical biogeochemical model off the pearl river estuary we illustrate that during the summer upwelling period the impact of p limitation reverses from suppressing hypoxia to amplifying hypoxia as p limitation severity decreases when p limitation is severe in the ecosystem i e p limitation extensively covers the stratified waters where hypoxia tends to develop the surface primary production and the coupled bottom oxygen consumption are diluted along the upstream downstream axis because of the p limitation in addition the increased downstream bottom oxygen level enhances the shoreward bottom oxygen influx these effects together reduce coastal hypoxia in contrast when p limitation severity is low i e p limitation is spatially constrained the downstream relocated surface production reduces upstream hypoxia but increases downstream hypoxia which subsequently weakens the shoreward bottom oxygen influx and hence lowers its capacity to relieve upstream hypoxia the net effect can amplify the coastal hypoxic extent our results emphasize how different p limitation severity can reverse its impact on coastal hypoxia due to the interacting changes in surface production and bottom oxygen influx we propose the potential of using the spatial extent of p limitation as a proxy to predict its impact on coastal hypoxia and support ecosystem nutrient management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords eutrophication coastal hypoxia phosphorus limitation physical biogeochemical model 1 introduction nitrogen n and phosphorus p availability limit phytoplankton production in most aquatic ecosystems such nutrient limitation however is overcome when there is excessive anthropogenic n and p introduced to the ecosystems an excessive nutrient supply stimulates phytoplankton growth increases decomposition of phytoplankton organic matter and triggers bottom water hypoxia dissolved oxygen 2 mg l the hypoxia caused by nutrient over enrichment occurs globally in estuarine and coastal waters and its frequency extent and duration are projected to increase as the anthropogenic nutrient delivery continuously rises breitburg et al 2018 in addition to the increasing nutrient loads the n p proportion of the nutrient runoff to coastal ecosystems has substantially increased and exceeds the average stoichiometric need for phytoplankton growth i e the canonical redfield ratio of 16 1 glibert et al 2014 wang et al 2021 the elevated n p proportion is primarily due to the increased anthropogenic use of n relative to p at a global scale glibert et al 2013 and the higher mobility and more diffuse sources of n than p pe√±uelas et al 2012 driven by the faster increase in river delivered dissolved inorganic n din relative to dissolved inorganic p dip temporary p limitation has become more common in estuarine and coastal systems conley 1999 paerl 2009 quigg et al 2011 wang et al 2021 xu et al 2008 yin et al 2004 generally p limitation is recognized to reduce the capacity of upstream water to assimilate din thereby enhancing din transport downstream to fuel primary production in more saline n limited waters paerl et al 2004 however the impact of p limitation on coastal hypoxia is challenging to observe because monitoring the effect on entire coastal systems at sufficient resolution and scale is difficult and manipulating n and p inputs to conduct whole ecosystem experiments is not feasible laurent and fennel 2017 as a result whether p limitation worsens or alleviates hypoxia remains inconclusive fennel and testa 2019 laurent and fennel 2014 scavia and donnelly 2007 and is hypothesized to be affected by a system s geometry laurent and fennel 2017 for example p limitation is more likely to amplify hypoxia in a one dimensional through flow system where a downstream shift of production and the accompanying oxygen sink would cause the hypoxia to relocate downstream on the contrary p limitation might suppress hypoxia in a dispersive open system where the stratification weakens downstream such that the downstream enhanced oxygen sink would not trigger downstream hypoxia laurent and fennel 2014 in this paper we hypothesize that the impact of p limitation reverses from suppressing coastal hypoxia to amplifying hypoxia when p limitation severity decreases the reversal occurs independent of a system s hydrodynamic conditions but is purely driven by the limitation induced interacting changes in surface primary production and the shoreward bottom oxygen influx the bottom oxygen influx is associated with the bottom water intrusion a characteristic feature in estuarine circulation and coastal upwelling systems p limitation affects the spatial distribution of surface phytoplankton production and thus the deposition flux of organic matter reaching the bottom waters or sediments and the subsequent remineralization induced oxygen consumption the altered oxygen consumption influences the bottom oxygen level and the horizontal oxygen gradient consequently altering the shoreward bottom oxygen influx despite that the velocity of bottom intrusion current is not modified our hypothesis is illustrated in fig 1 during severe p limitation e g when there are large river inputs of din and dip with a high n p ratio fig 1a b the p limitation extensively covers the stratified water where hypoxia tends to develop as a result the surface phytoplankton biomass and its coupled bottom oxygen consumption are diluted along the upstream downstream axis due to the p limitation in addition the elevated downstream bottom oxygen level enhances the shoreward bottom oxygen influx these effects jointly mitigate hypoxia in contrast when p limitation severity is lower e g when there are moderate river inputs of din and dip despite a high n p ratio fig 1c d the water rapidly transitions from being p limited to being n limited along the upstream downstream axis the dilution of the surface primary production reduces the upstream bottom oxygen sink but enhances the bottom oxygen sink in the n limited downstream water this enhanced downstream oxygen sink may turn the downstream bottom water into hypoxic moreover the decreased downstream bottom oxygen level whether hypoxic or not further reduces the shoreward bottom oxygen influx and hence its capacity to replenish upstream hypoxia as a result the net effect of p limitation on the overall hypoxic extent can be amplification this study aims to verify the hypothesis described in the previous paragraph namely how and why the impact of p limitation on coastal hypoxia reverses depending on p limitation severity to that end we carry out a series of nutrient scenario simulations in the pearl river estuary pre in the northern south china sea using a validated three dimensional 3d physical biogeochemical model we examine the summer oxygen dynamics and hypoxia in pre during times of upwelling and investigate how and why they change under different nutrient limitation conditions the results confirm our hypothesis that the impact of p limitation on coastal hypoxia reverses due to the interacting changes in surface production and the shoreward bottom oxygen influx under different levels of p limitation severity we also propose that the spatial extent of p limitation which can reflect the severity of the limitation and is detectable by measuring nutrient concentrations can be used as a proxy to predict the unobservable impact of p limitation on coastal hypoxia 2 material and methods 2 1 study region the pre in the northern south china sea fig 2 a receives excessive amounts of anthropogenic nutrients from the pearl river the second largest river in china in terms of freshwater discharge 3 26 1011 m3 yr 1 zhao 1990 just as in the rest of the world over the past few decades the pearl river has experienced an increase in river n and p loads that have a remarkably high din dip ratio 100 as a result the surface din concentration and din dip ratio in the pre has significantly increased the increase is reflected in monthly din and dip data from 1991 to 2020 sampled at a station in the upper pre fig 3 a b the time series data is collected and analysed by the hong kong environmental protection department epd www epd gov hk in addition to the river input the submarine groundwater delivers nutrients at a high n p ratio to the estuarine and coastal waters dai et al 2021 liu et al 2018 which may exacerbate the p limitation the contribution of submarine groundwater is not considered in this study as we focus on the impact of p limitation at a large spatial scale of coastal waters where pearl river input is the dominant nutrient source in addition to the impact of the large river discharge the circulation off the pre is profoundly affected by the wind driven coastal current notably during the wet season april to september when nearly 80 of the annual pearl river discharge occurs the southwesterly monsoon wind prevails that favours producing upwelling the strong seaward surface flow rich with nutrients converges with the wind driven along shelf current in the coastal transition zone ctz off the pre this convergence creates a stable water column that restricts the vertical oxygen supply and favours the accumulation of phytoplankton derived organic matter om and river delivered terrestrial om all of which promote hypoxia formation in the ctz li et al 2020 yu et al 2020 2 2 model description we conducted a process oriented investigation using a coupled physical biogeochemical model fig 2 details of the model setup parameterization and validation are presented in previous studies li et al 2020 liu and gan 2020 yu et al 2020 yu and gan 2021 briefly the physical component of the model is a 3d high resolution configuration of the regional ocean modelling system roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 for the pre and its adjacent shelf in the northern south china sea fig 2a the model adopts an adaptive horizontal resolution gradually decreasing from ultrahigh 0 1 km in the estuary and inner shelf to 1 km over the shelf at the southern open boundary in addition it has 30 terrain following vertical layers with refined resolution 0 2 m near the surface and bottom the biogeochemical component fig 2b c is adapted from the n based model developed by fennel et al 2006 and includes cycling of oxygen fennel et al 2013 phosphorus gan et al 2014 laurent et al 2012 and terrestrial organic matter yu et al 2015 2020 following laurent et al 2012 the model adopts the minimum functional form to estimate nutrient limitation assuming that phytoplankton growth depends on the most limited nutrient n or p specifically we calculate the din limitation factor using the formula l n n o 3 k n o 3 n o 3 1 1 n h 4 k n h 4 n h 4 k n h 4 n h 4 and the dip limitation factor with the formula l p d i p k d i p d i p where k n o 3 k n h 4 and k d i p are the half saturation constants for phytoplankton uptake of nitrate no3 ammonium nh4 and dip the l n and l p range from 0 to 1 with the smaller value indicating stronger limitation we then compute the nutrient co limitation factor as l min l n l p and apply it to the formula for the specific phytoplankton growth rate Œº as Œº Œº m a x e t l where Œº m a x e t is the light and temperature dependent maximum growth rate of the phytoplankton we here define l above 0 75 as weak or absence of nutrient limitation and l decreasing from 0 75 to 0 as moderate to strong limitation the oxygen dynamics are governed by air sea exchange physical transport and biogeochemical oxygen production and consumption processes fig 2c the equation for the evolution of oxygen o2 can be written as o 2 t u o 2 Œ∫ o 2 p p w c r f b f where the five terms on the right hand side represent advection diffusion photosynthetic production p p water column oxygen consumption w c r and boundary oxygen fluxes respectively here u is the velocity vector and Œ∫ is the eddy diffusivity the term w c r represents the sum of water column consumption processes including zooplankton respiration nitrification and remineralization of organic matter the term f b f represents the boundary oxygen fluxes and is only applied to the surface layer as the air sea oxygen exchange and the bottom layer as the sediment oxygen consumption f b f is 0 at the layers between the surface and bottom parameterizations of the oxygen terms are detailed in yu et al 2020 and yu and gan 2021 the coupled physical biogeochemical model is driven by simplified but representative summer forcings to conduct process oriented investigations the process oriented approach is better suited to distinguish the processes at work under the complex multi forcing processes and has been proven useful for investigating the dynamic physical and biogeochemical interactions in the study region gan et al 2014 li et al 2020 yu et al 2020 briefly the model is forced with a steady and spatially uniform southwesterly upwelling favourable wind that characterizes the typical summer southwesterly monsoon wind solar radiation with a diurnal cycle is applied following gan et al 2014 river discharge rate temperature salinity and concentrations of nutrients oxygen and organic matter are based on the long term summer monitoring data and historical measurements cai et al 2004 ni et al 2008 horizontally uniform initial conditions generated from observational profiles are used to initialize the model and investigate the spatiotemporally evolving processes following gan et al 2014 an open boundary condition that concurrently accommodates tidal and subtidal forcing is applied at the open boundaries liu and gan 2016 in which external subtidal flows are provided by an idealized cross shelf two dimensional model simulation following gan and allen 2005 and major tidal constituents m2 s2 k2 n2 k1 o1 q1 p1 and m4 are obtained from the oregon state university tidal inversion software otis egbert and erofeeva 2002 lastly a passive radiation condition is adopted for the biological variables at all three open boundaries 2 3 field observations and model validation nutrient observations at the surface and bottom waters locations shown in fig 2a are used to examine the nutrient limitation conditions and validate the model results the field observations are from cruise surveys during the summers of 2015 and 2017 when coastal upwelling prevailed sampling and analysis methods are presented in lu et al 2018 and li et al 2020 the din concentration was computed as the sum of observed no3 no2 and nh4 concentrations for some sampling stations where nh4 and or no2 observations were not available din was computed as no3 no2 or no3 given the generally higher no3 concentration than the nh4 and no2 concentrations in most of the surveyed waters missing nh4 and or no2 in part of the sampling stations will have little impact on the presented distribution pattern of the din previous model validation by field observations showed that the coupled model realistically captures the characteristic circulation and ecosystem features in and off the pre during summer liu et al 2020 liu and gan 2020 li et al 2020 2021 yu et al 2020 these features include the distinct two layer estuarine circulation surface freshwater outflow and bottom seawater inflow within the estuary fig 4 c d seaward extended nutrient rich river plume fig 4a wind driven coastal upwelling fig 4b and hypoxia development in the ctz off the pre fig 4b also noticeable is that the shelf water downstream of the ctz has relatively higher bottom water oxygen fig 4b thereby enabling the shoreward bottom oxygen influx to become a source of oxygen to replenish the oxygen deficient ctz during prevailing summer upwelling fig 4b c here we further show that the model reasonably reproduces the observed din and dip concentrations figs s1 s2 in the supplement and captures the observed spatial pattern of nutrient limitation fig 5 both the observations and the simulation show that the limitation primarily shifts from weak p limitation limitation factor l 0 75 within the estuary and the adjacent ctz to strong p limitation l 0 3 downstream of the plume affected waters and shifts to n limitation in the saline coastal marine waters fig 5 2 4 model experiments to quantify the impact of the p limitation we performed two types of simulations control simulations which used the multi nutrient model with n and p cycling shown in fig 2b and n only simulations which had a setup identical to the control simulations except that we disabled the p cycling in the multi nutrient model to enable n as the only limiting nutrient we used the difference between the control and n only simulations computed as control minus n only to represent the impact of the p limitation on the ecosystem we first conducted a pair of simulations with standard river nutrient concentrations no3 nh4 and dip at 120 3 and 0 8 mmol m3 respectively that we called the baseline simulations the baseline simulations represent the severe p limitation scenarios as demonstrated by the extensive p limitation shown in fig 5b next to create scenarios with lower p limitation severity we conducted three pairs of simulations whose setups were identical to the baseline pair except we simultaneously reduced the river din and dip concentrations by 60 70 and 80 respectively called the x n p scenarios where x denotes the percentage reduction to further examine the sensitivity of the results to the variable freshwater river discharge we carried out scenarios of different p limitation severity under different riverine inputs of freshwater while preserving the nutrient loading i e by adjusting the riverine nutrient concentrations specifically the first group of four pairs of simulations adopted the baseline freshwater discharge 18 400 m3 s while the other groups had freshwater discharge reduced by 20 and 50 respectively referred to as 20 fw and 50 fw the three discharge values we adopted are within the variable range of summer discharge of the pearl river we ran each model simulation for 45 days during which the simulated biogeochemical fields reached quasi steady states after about 30 days we based our analyses on model outputs averaged over a complete neap spring tidal cycle i e day 38 to 45 3 reversing impact of p limitation on coastal hypoxia 3 1 impact under severe p limitation we investigate the impact of severe p limitation on coastal hypoxia and related oxygen processes by first examining the baseline simulations fig 6 a presents the changes caused by p limitation in the water column integrated primary production the changes in production show three spatial regimes a slight reduction in the upper estuary and in the majority of the ctz where the p limitation is relatively weak a substantial decrease in the intermediate region of the plume where p is severely limited and a slight increase farther downstream of the plume fig 6a a weakened production is expected to reduce the subsurface oxygen consumption and thereby increase bottom water oxygen concentration and vice versa yet interestingly a sizable spatial misalignment exists between the limitation induced changes in the primary production fig 6a and the bottom oxygen fig 6b generally a marked increase in bottom oxygen occurs in the majority of the ctz and is located more shoreward than the substantial reduction in production this misalignment is also confirmed by the weak correlation between the changes in production correlation coefficient r 0 28 or the bottom oxygen consumption r 0 47 with the changes in bottom oxygen level fig s3 the enhanced bottom oxygen level in the ctz the hypoxia hotspot due to the p limitation remarkably reduces the hypoxic extent 60 reduction in area and 79 in volume and retracts the hypoxia towards the shallower waters the latter is further depicted by that the bathymetry in which the 90th percentile of the hypoxia falls is shallower in the control simulation 18 5 m than in the n only simulation 25 m fig 7 a additionally fig 7b shows that hypoxia mainly occurs in waters shallower than where most of the remarkable decrease in production occurs consistent with the spatial decoupling of elevated bottom oxygen and weakened production shown in fig 6a b it follows that the in situ or local changes in biogeochemical oxygen rates can only partially explain the enhanced bottom oxygen level and reduced hypoxia in the ctz the lateral transport of subsurface oxygen an external source of oxygen must play a non negligible role indeed while p limitation reduces the upper water oxygen level by suppressing the surface production it increases the subsurface oxygen level due to the reduced subsurface oxygen sink fig 6c the altered oxygen levels lead to a decrease in upper water oxygen outflux and an increase in the subsurface oxygen influx to the ctz fig 6d the enhanced subsurface oxygen influx subsequently replenishes the oxygen deficient bottom water in ctz and contributes to reducing hypoxia to further quantify the relative importance of the changes caused by p limitation in the external oxygen flux and the local internal oxygen processes on the changes in oxygen levels we computed the oxygen budget near the bottom of the ctz fig 7c for the bottom water in ctz horizontal advection and vertical mixing act as oxygen sources whereas the net biogeochemical process primary production minus water column and sediment oxygen consumption is an oxygen sink the effect of p limitation enhances the horizontal advection of oxygen by 21 but reduces the vertical mixing of oxygen by 18 and the net biogeochemical sink by 12 the enhanced horizontal advection of oxygen due to the strengthened shoreward oxygen influx is considered a change in external oxygen source caused by the p limitation on the contrary both the weakened vertical mixing of oxygen due to a weakened vertical oxygen gradient and the reduced net biogeochemical oxygen sink are attributed to the p limitation suppressed surface production and hence considered to be the changes in local internal oxygen processes the changes in vertical mixing and net biogeochemical oxygen sink add up to a local net oxygen sink this local net oxygen sink increases by 20 due to the p limitation a magnitude comparable to the 21 increase in horizontal oxygen advection in summary p limitation increases the local internal net oxygen sink and the external oxygen source with the former amplifying hypoxia and the latter mitigating hypoxia the changes in the two interacting processes are equivalent in magnitude but work oppositely to determine the net effect of p limitation on the bottom water oxygen level and hypoxia this net effect significantly reduces hypoxia off pre under the severe p limitation 3 2 impact under lower p limitation severity section 3 1 reveals that severe p limitation markedly reduces hypoxia due to the combined effects of downstream diluted primary production and enhanced shoreward subsurface oxygen influx here we investigate how the conclusion might change under lower p limitation severity by comparing scenarios with the same physics but less severe p limitation conditions then we examine whether the changes hold for other river freshwater inputs first we examine the different limitation severity scenarios using the baseline freshwater discharge as the p limitation severity weakens indicated by the shrinking percentage of p limitation area in fig 8 a and fig s4 the effect of p limitation on suppressing the production and increasing bottom water oxygen weakens and consequently reverses so that production increases and downstream surface salinity 24 bottom water oxygen decreases fig s4 the impact of the reversal is reflected in the altered vertical oxygen distribution in the downstream alongshore transect the vertical distribution shows that the limitation reduces upper water oxygen and increases the subsurface oxygen level when p limitation is severe fig 9 a but this pattern weakens and eventually reverses to increase upper water oxygen and reduce subsurface oxygen when p limitation severity decreases fig 9b d the reversal occurs in 70 n p and 80 n p directly affected by the change in limitation altered subsurface oxygen level the shoreward subsurface oxygen inflow changes from increasing to decreasing as p limitation severity decreases fig 8b it subsequently affects the impact of p limitation on horizontal oxygen advection within the ctz which reverses from enhancing to weakening its capacity to replenish the oxygen deficient zone fig 8c a similar reversing trend appears in the limitation altered local net oxygen sink fig 8d the declining and reversing trend of the effect of p limitation on oxygen concentration and regulating processes leads to a declining and reversing impact on the hypoxic extent fig 8e f specifically the limitation induced reduction in downstream hypoxia declines as p limitation becomes less severe e g reduction in downstream hypoxic volume decreases from 84 in the baseline scenario to 10 in 60 n p and ultimately shifts to increase hypoxia under very low p limitation severity e g downstream hypoxic volume increases by 5 in 70 n p and 11 in 80 n p fig 8e the above trend holds for the hypoxic volume in the entire system except that the hypoxia increase has not happened yet even in the scenario of lowest most spatially constrained p limitation severity under this baseline freshwater input fig 8f the reversing impact from high to lower p limitation severity generally holds for different hydrodynamic conditions created by varying river discharge inputs figs 8 9 demonstrating the robustness of our results the noticeable difference is that the p limitation area shrinks when the river freshwater discharge is reduced despite preserving river nutrient loads fig 8a the shrinkage occurs because the reduced discharge reduces the plume s extent and leads to more upstream concentrated n and p for biological recycling as a result under the lower freshwater discharge the declining p limitation impact steepens to reach the reversing point earlier fig 8b d also the p limitation impact shifts to slightly expanding the hypoxia for scenarios of lowest p limitation severity 70 n p and 80 n p in the 50 fw scenario fig 8f 4 discussion temporary p limitation of phytoplankton growth is more commonly observed in estuarine and coastal hypoxic systems fennel and testa 2019 due to rising anthropogenic nutrient contributions that elevate the n p ratio glibert et al 2013 however despite the potential importance of p limitation to hypoxia development observations of p limitation impact on coastal hypoxia are scarce primarily due to the difficulty in observing the effect quantitative assessment of p limitation impact on hypoxia thus largely relies on numerical modeling but such assessment is currently limited to few hypoxic systems laurent and fennel 2014 2017 fennel and laurent 2018 as a result it remains unsettled why p limitation is considered to aggravate hypoxia in some systems conley 1999 paerl et al 2004 but mitigate hypoxia in others laurent and fennel 2014 laurent and fennel 2017 proposed that the effect of p limitation may be related to a specific system s geometry where p limitation is more likely to amplify hypoxia in one dimensional flow through systems e g neuse river estuary but tend to alleviate hypoxia in open dispersive systems e g northern gulf of mexico affected by mississippi river plume while the proposal helps explain the contrasting effects of p limitation on hypoxia among different systems question remains at whether and why the effect can contrast in the same hypoxic system e g scavia and donnelly 2007 laurent and fennel 2014 combining observations and results from a coupled physical biogeochemical model off a large eutrophic estuary during summer upwelling conditions we validate the hypothesis that the impact of p limitation reverses from suppressing coastal hypoxia to amplifying hypoxia when p limitation severity decreases fig 1 we show that the reversal is independent of a system s hydrodynamic conditions it is driven by the interacting limitation induced changes in the surface primary production and the shoreward bottom oxygen influx when p limitation is severe or spatially extensive the downstream diluted primary production reduces the bottom oxygen sink in most of the plume impacted waters and enhances the shoreward bottom oxygen influx because of the increased downstream oxygen level these effects jointly reduce hypoxia in the entire coastal system when p limitation severity is lower or spatially constrained while the diluted production mitigates upstream hypoxia by lowering the bottom oxygen sink the primary production relocates downstream and increases oxygen consumption and hence hypoxia downstream the reduced bottom oxygen downstream subsequently reduces the shoreward oxygen influx that could otherwise alleviate upstream bottom hypoxia as a result the net effect of lower p limitation severity amplifies hypoxia in the ecosystem the reversing impact of p limitation on coastal hypoxia has important management implications for pre and other hypoxic systems the pre is an outstanding example of a large eutrophic estuary under the present excessively high river din and dip loads with a high n p ratio 100 p is the dominant limiting nutrient in most of the water affected by the river plume off the pre during summer however although a high n p ratio prevails in the inner estuary and the neighboring ctz where hypoxia is prone to develop p limitation in the inner estuary and ctz remains weak owing to the high din and dip levels contributed by the pearl river the p limitation intensifies along the plume s path due to the biological uptake of n and p at the redfield ratio this substantial p limitation has long been reported to suppress primary production and is suspected to reduce hypoxia in the pre during summer yin et al 2004 2011 yin and harrison 2008 our modeling investigation confirms that p limitation markedly suppresses primary production and hypoxia however we show that the weakened hypoxia is not simply a vertical local process that is the suppressed surface primary production reduces the net subsurface oxygen sink and elevates the bottom oxygen concentration instead the enhanced shoreward oxygen influx due to the elevated downstream bottom oxygen level which is an external horizontal process plays an equally important role as the vertical processes in alleviating hypoxia furthermore because the impact of p limitation on hypoxia reverses when p limitation severity is relatively low the nutrient management strategy based on impact assessments should not be static but should adapt to changing nutrient limitation conditions when the nutrient reduction strategies take effect our work also suggests that the spatial extent of p limitation which is relatively easy to measure can be used as a proxy to predict whether the impact of p limitation amplifies or relieves coastal hypoxia the spatial extent can guide nutrient management for a specific system generally the more spatially constrained the p limitation is equivalent to the more rapid transition from p limited to n limited condition along the plume s path the more likely the limitation is to amplify hypoxia this is because in a less severe p limitation scenario the limitation induced hypoxia reduction upstream would be slight while the excess n transported downstream would effectively fuel the n limited water to enhance hypoxia downstream lastly like all modeling studies there exist uncertainties in our model simulations for example our model does not include the nutrients of a high n p ratio delivered by submarine groundwater dai et al 2021 that may aggravate p limitation in addition the model does not account for the use of organic phosphorus as an alternative p source for phytoplankton growth li et al 2017 or the release of iron bound p from sediments during hypoxic conditions both processes may alleviate the p limitation future work is needed to understand and quantify the contributions of these different sources and types of phosphorus to the impact of p limitation on coastal hypoxia nonetheless considering the complexity of the processes involved the scarcity of observations and the large uncertainties in model parameterization focusing on the dominant p source i e riverine dip as in our and previous modeling assessments e g laurent et al 2014 2017 is a necessary step to simulating more realistic p dynamics and p limitation impact on coastal hypoxia 5 conclusion by combining observations with numerical results from a 3d physical biogeochemical model off the pearl river estuary we illustrate that during the summer upwelling period the effect of p limitation on coastal hypoxia can reverse from suppression to amplification due to interacting changes in surface primary production and shoreward bottom oxygen influx under high versus low p limitation severity we highlight the role of altering shoreward bottom oxygen influx in modulating the effect of p limitation on coastal hypoxia which has had less historical attention than the downstream diluted production in p limitation impact assessments finally we show that the spatial extent of p limitation can be a useful proxy to predict the impact of p limitation on coastal hypoxia and guide nutrient management in an affected estuarine and coastal system funding this work was supported by the

upstream water to assimilate din thereby enhancing din transport downstream to fuel primary production in more saline n limited waters paerl et al 2004 however the impact of p limitation on coastal

where a downstream shift of production and the accompanying oxygen sink would cause the hypoxia to relocate downstream on the contrary p limitation might suppress hypoxia in a dispersive open system where the stratification weakens downstream such that the downstream enhanced oxygen sink would not trigger downstream hypoxia laurent and fennel 2014 in this paper we hypothesize that the impact of p limitation reverses from suppressing coastal hypoxia to amplifying hypoxia when p limitation severity decreases the reversal occurs independent of a system s hydrodynamic conditions but is purely driven by the limitation induced interacting changes in surface primary production and the shoreward bottom oxygen influx the bottom oxygen influx is associated with the bottom water intrusion a characteristic feature in estuarine circulation and coastal upwelling systems p limitation affects the spatial distribution of surface phytoplankton production and thus the deposition flux of organic matter reaching the bottom waters or sediments and the subsequent remineralization induced oxygen consumption the altered oxygen consumption influences the bottom oxygen level and the horizontal

downstream bottom oxygen level whether hypoxic or not further reduces the shoreward bottom oxygen influx and hence its capacity to replenish upstream hypoxia as a result the net effect of p limitation on the overall hypoxic extent can be amplification this study aims to verify the hypothesis described in the previous paragraph namely how and why the impact of p limitation on coastal hypoxia reverses depending on p limitation severity to that end we carry out a series of nutrient scenario simulations in the pearl river estuary pre in the northern south china sea using a validated three dimensional 3d physical biogeochemical model we examine the summer oxygen dynamics and hypoxia in pre during times of upwelling and investigate how and why they change under different nutrient limitation conditions the results confirm our hypothesis that the impact of p limitation on coastal hypoxia reverses due to the interacting changes in surface production and the shoreward bottom oxygen influx under different levels of p limitation severity we also propose that the spatial extent of p limitation which can reflect the severity of the limitation and is detectable by measuring nutrient concentrations can be used as a proxy to predict the unobservable impact of p limitation on coastal hypoxia 2 material and methods 2 1 study region the pre in the northern south china sea fig 2 a receives excessive amounts of anthropogenic nutrients from the pearl river the second largest river in china in terms of freshwater discharge 3 26 1011 m3 yr 1 zhao 1990 just as in the rest of the world over the past few decades the pearl river has experienced an increase in river n and p loads that have a remarkably high din dip ratio 100 as a result the surface din concentration and din dip ratio in the pre has significantly increased the increase is reflected in monthly din and dip data from 1991 to 2020 sampled at a station in the upper pre fig 3 a b the time series data is collected and analysed by the hong kong environmental protection department epd www epd gov hk in addition to the river input the submarine groundwater delivers nutrients at a high n p ratio to the estuarine and coastal waters dai et al 2021 liu et al 2018 which may exacerbate the p limitation the contribution of submarine groundwater is not considered in this study as we focus on the impact of p limitation at a large spatial scale of coastal waters where pearl river input is the dominant nutrient source in addition to the impact of the large river discharge the circulation off the pre is profoundly affected by the wind driven coastal current notably during the wet season april to september when nearly 80 of the annual pearl river discharge occurs the southwesterly monsoon wind prevails that favours producing upwelling the strong seaward surface flow rich with nutrients converges with the wind driven along shelf current in the coastal transition zone ctz off the pre this convergence creates a stable water column that restricts the vertical oxygen supply and favours the accumulation of phytoplankton derived organic matter om and river delivered terrestrial om all of which promote hypoxia formation in the ctz li et al 2020 yu et al 2020 2 2 model description we conducted a process oriented investigation using a coupled physical biogeochemical model fig 2 details of the model setup parameterization and validation are presented in previous studies li et al 2020 liu and gan 2020 yu et al 2020 yu and gan 2021 briefly the physical component of the model is a 3d high resolution configuration of the regional ocean modelling system roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 for the pre and its adjacent shelf in the northern south china sea fig 2a the model adopts an adaptive horizontal resolution gradually decreasing from ultrahigh 0 1 km in the estuary and inner shelf to 1 km over the shelf at the southern open boundary in addition it has 30 terrain following vertical layers with refined resolution 0 2 m near the surface and bottom the biogeochemical component fig 2b c is adapted from the n based model developed by fennel et al 2006 and includes cycling of oxygen fennel et al 2013 phosphorus gan et al 2014 laurent et al 2012 and terrestrial organic matter yu et al 2015 2020 following laurent et al 2012 the model adopts the minimum functional form to estimate nutrient limitation assuming that phytoplankton growth depends on the most limited nutrient n or p specifically we calculate the din limitation factor using the formula l n n o 3 k n o 3 n o 3 1 1 n h 4 k n h 4 n h 4 k n h 4 n h 4 and the dip limitation factor with the formula l p d i p k d i p d i p where k n o 3 k n h 4 and k d i p are the half saturation constants for phytoplankton uptake of nitrate no3 ammonium nh4 and dip the l n and l p range from 0 to 1 with the smaller value indicating stronger limitation we then compute the nutrient co limitation factor as l min l n l p and apply it to the formula for the specific phytoplankton growth rate Œº as Œº Œº m a x e t l where Œº m a x e t is the light and temperature dependent maximum growth rate of the phytoplankton we here define l above 0 75 as weak or absence of nutrient limitation and l decreasing from 0 75 to 0 as moderate to strong limitation the oxygen dynamics are governed by air sea exchange physical transport and biogeochemical oxygen production and consumption processes fig 2c the equation for the evolution of oxygen o2 can be written as o 2 t u o 2 Œ∫ o 2 p p w c r f b f where the five terms on the right hand side represent advection diffusion photosynthetic production p p water column oxygen consumption w c r and boundary oxygen fluxes respectively here u is the velocity vector and Œ∫ is the eddy diffusivity the term w c r represents the sum of water column consumption processes including zooplankton respiration nitrification and remineralization of organic matter the term f b f represents the boundary oxygen fluxes and is only applied to the surface layer as the air sea oxygen exchange and the bottom layer as the sediment oxygen consumption f b f is 0 at the layers between the surface and bottom parameterizations of the oxygen terms are detailed in yu et al 2020 and yu and gan 2021 the coupled physical biogeochemical model is driven by simplified but representative summer forcings to conduct process oriented investigations the process oriented approach is better suited to distinguish the processes at work under the complex multi forcing processes and has been proven useful for investigating the dynamic physical and biogeochemical interactions in the study region gan et al 2014 li et al 2020 yu et al 2020 briefly the model is forced with a steady and spatially uniform southwesterly upwelling favourable wind that characterizes the typical summer southwesterly monsoon wind solar radiation with a diurnal cycle is applied following gan et al 2014 river discharge rate temperature salinity and concentrations of nutrients oxygen and organic matter are based on the long term summer monitoring data and historical measurements cai et al 2004 ni et al 2008 horizontally uniform initial conditions generated from observational profiles are used to initialize the model and investigate the spatiotemporally evolving processes following gan et al 2014 an open boundary condition that concurrently accommodates tidal and subtidal forcing is applied at the open boundaries liu and gan 2016 in which external subtidal flows are provided by an idealized cross shelf two dimensional model simulation following gan and allen 2005 and major tidal constituents m2 s2 k2 n2 k1 o1 q1 p1 and m4 are obtained from the oregon state university tidal inversion software otis egbert and erofeeva 2002 lastly a passive radiation condition is adopted for the biological variables at all three open boundaries 2 3 field observations and model validation nutrient observations at the surface and bottom waters locations shown in fig 2a are used to examine the nutrient limitation conditions and validate the model results the field observations are from cruise surveys during the summers of 2015 and 2017 when coastal upwelling prevailed sampling and analysis methods are presented in lu et al 2018 and li et al 2020 the din concentration was computed as the sum of observed no3 no2 and nh4 concentrations for some sampling stations where nh4 and or no2 observations were not available din was computed as no3 no2 or no3 given the generally higher no3 concentration than the nh4 and no2 concentrations in most of the surveyed waters missing nh4 and or no2 in part of the sampling stations will have little impact on the presented distribution pattern of the din previous model validation by field observations showed that the coupled model realistically captures the characteristic circulation and ecosystem features in and off the pre during summer liu et al 2020 liu and gan 2020 li et al 2020 2021 yu et al 2020 these features include the distinct two layer estuarine circulation surface freshwater outflow and bottom seawater inflow within the estuary fig 4 c d seaward extended nutrient rich river plume fig 4a wind driven coastal upwelling fig 4b and hypoxia development in the ctz off the pre fig 4b also noticeable is that the shelf water downstream of the ctz has relatively higher bottom water oxygen fig 4b thereby enabling the shoreward bottom oxygen influx to become a source of oxygen to replenish the oxygen deficient ctz during prevailing summer upwelling fig 4b c here we further show that the model reasonably reproduces the observed din and dip concentrations figs s1 s2 in the supplement and captures the observed spatial pattern of nutrient limitation fig 5 both the observations and the simulation show that the limitation primarily shifts from weak p limitation limitation factor l 0 75 within the estuary and the adjacent ctz to strong p limitation l 0 3 downstream of the plume affected waters and shifts to n limitation in the saline coastal marine waters fig 5 2 4 model experiments to quantify the impact of the p limitation we performed two types of simulations control simulations which used the multi nutrient model with n and p cycling shown in fig 2b and n only simulations which had a setup identical to the control simulations except that we disabled the p cycling in the multi nutrient model to enable n as the only limiting nutrient we used the difference between the control and n only simulations computed as control minus n only to represent the impact of the p limitation on the ecosystem we first conducted a pair of simulations with standard river nutrient concentrations no3 nh4 and dip at 120 3 and 0 8 mmol m3 respectively that we called the baseline simulations the baseline simulations represent the severe p limitation scenarios as demonstrated by the extensive p limitation shown in fig 5b next to create scenarios with lower p limitation severity we conducted three pairs of simulations whose setups were identical to the baseline pair except we simultaneously reduced the river din and dip concentrations by 60 70 and 80 respectively called the x n p scenarios where x denotes the percentage reduction to further examine the sensitivity of the results to the variable freshwater river discharge we carried out scenarios of different p limitation severity under different riverine inputs of freshwater while preserving the nutrient loading i e by adjusting the riverine nutrient concentrations specifically the first group of four pairs of simulations adopted the baseline freshwater discharge 18 400 m3 s while the other groups had freshwater discharge reduced by 20 and 50 respectively referred to as 20 fw and 50 fw the three discharge values we adopted are within the variable range of summer discharge of the pearl river we ran each model simulation for 45 days during which the simulated biogeochemical fields reached quasi steady states after about 30 days we based our analyses on model outputs averaged over a complete neap spring tidal cycle i e day 38 to 45 3 reversing impact of p limitation on coastal hypoxia 3 1 impact under severe p limitation we investigate the impact of severe p limitation on coastal hypoxia and related oxygen processes by first examining the baseline simulations fig 6 a presents the changes caused by p limitation in the water column integrated primary production the changes in production show three spatial regimes a slight reduction in the upper estuary and in the majority of the ctz where the p limitation is relatively weak a substantial decrease in the intermediate region of the plume where p is severely limited and a slight increase farther downstream of the plume fig 6a a weakened production is expected to reduce the subsurface oxygen consumption and thereby increase bottom water oxygen concentration and vice versa yet interestingly a sizable spatial misalignment exists between the limitation induced changes in the primary production fig 6a and the bottom oxygen fig 6b generally a marked increase in bottom oxygen occurs in the majority of the ctz and is located more shoreward than the substantial reduction in production this misalignment is also confirmed by the weak correlation between the changes in production correlation coefficient r 0 28 or the bottom oxygen consumption r 0 47 with the changes in bottom oxygen level fig s3 the enhanced bottom oxygen level in the ctz the hypoxia hotspot due to the p limitation remarkably reduces the hypoxic extent 60 reduction in area and 79 in volume and retracts the hypoxia towards the shallower waters the latter is further depicted by that the bathymetry in which the 90th percentile of the hypoxia falls is shallower in the control simulation 18 5 m than in the n only simulation 25 m fig 7 a additionally fig 7b shows that hypoxia mainly occurs in waters shallower than where most of the remarkable decrease in production occurs consistent with the spatial decoupling of elevated bottom oxygen and weakened production shown in fig 6a b it follows that the in situ or local changes in biogeochemical oxygen rates can only partially explain the enhanced bottom oxygen level and reduced hypoxia in the ctz the lateral transport of subsurface oxygen an external source of oxygen must play a non negligible role indeed while p limitation reduces the upper water oxygen level by suppressing the surface production it increases the subsurface oxygen level due to the reduced subsurface oxygen sink fig 6c the altered oxygen levels lead to a decrease in upper water oxygen outflux and an increase in the subsurface oxygen influx to the ctz fig 6d the enhanced subsurface oxygen influx subsequently replenishes the oxygen deficient bottom water in ctz and contributes to reducing hypoxia to further quantify the relative importance of the changes caused by p limitation in the external oxygen flux and the local internal oxygen processes on the changes in oxygen levels we computed the oxygen budget near the bottom of the ctz fig 7c for the bottom water in ctz horizontal advection and vertical mixing act as oxygen sources whereas the net biogeochemical process primary production minus water column and sediment oxygen consumption is an oxygen sink the effect of p limitation enhances the horizontal advection of oxygen by 21 but reduces the vertical mixing of oxygen by 18 and the net biogeochemical sink by 12 the enhanced horizontal advection of oxygen due to the strengthened shoreward oxygen influx is considered a change in external oxygen source caused by the p limitation on the contrary both the weakened vertical mixing of oxygen due to a weakened vertical oxygen gradient and the reduced net biogeochemical oxygen sink are attributed to the p limitation suppressed surface production and hence considered to be the changes in local internal oxygen processes the changes in vertical mixing and net biogeochemical oxygen sink add up to a local net oxygen sink this local net oxygen sink increases by 20 due to the p limitation a magnitude comparable to the 21 increase in horizontal oxygen advection in summary p limitation increases the local internal net oxygen sink and the external oxygen source with the former amplifying hypoxia and the latter mitigating hypoxia the changes in the two interacting processes are equivalent in magnitude but work oppositely to determine the net effect of p limitation on the bottom water oxygen level and hypoxia this net effect significantly reduces hypoxia off pre under the severe p limitation 3 2 impact under lower p limitation severity section 3 1 reveals that severe p limitation markedly reduces hypoxia due to the combined effects of downstream diluted primary production and enhanced shoreward subsurface oxygen influx here we investigate how the conclusion might change under lower p limitation severity by comparing scenarios with the same physics but less severe p limitation conditions then we examine whether the changes hold for other river freshwater inputs first we examine the different limitation severity scenarios using the baseline freshwater discharge as the p limitation severity weakens indicated by the shrinking percentage of p limitation area in fig 8 a and fig s4 the effect of p limitation on suppressing the production and increasing bottom water oxygen weakens and consequently reverses so that production increases and downstream surface salinity 24 bottom water oxygen decreases fig s4 the impact of the reversal is reflected in the altered vertical oxygen distribution in the downstream alongshore transect the vertical distribution shows that the limitation reduces upper water oxygen and increases the subsurface oxygen level when p limitation is severe fig 9 a but this pattern weakens and eventually reverses to increase upper water oxygen and reduce subsurface oxygen when p limitation severity decreases fig 9b d the reversal occurs in 70 n p and 80 n p directly affected by the change in limitation altered subsurface oxygen level the shoreward subsurface oxygen inflow changes from increasing to decreasing as p limitation severity decreases fig 8b it subsequently affects the impact of p limitation on horizontal oxygen advection within the ctz which reverses from enhancing to weakening its capacity to replenish the oxygen deficient zone fig 8c a similar reversing trend appears in the limitation altered local net oxygen sink fig 8d the declining and reversing trend of the effect of p limitation on oxygen concentration and regulating processes leads to a declining and reversing impact on the hypoxic extent fig 8e f specifically the limitation induced reduction in downstream hypoxia declines as p limitation becomes less severe e g reduction in downstream hypoxic volume decreases from 84 in the baseline scenario to 10 in 60 n p and ultimately shifts to increase hypoxia under very low p limitation severity e g downstream hypoxic volume increases by 5 in 70 n p and 11 in 80 n p fig 8e the above trend holds for the hypoxic volume in the entire system except that the hypoxia increase has not happened yet even in the scenario of lowest most spatially constrained p limitation severity under this baseline freshwater input fig 8f the reversing impact from high to lower p limitation severity generally holds for different hydrodynamic conditions created by varying river discharge inputs figs 8 9 demonstrating the robustness of our results the noticeable difference is that the p limitation area shrinks when the river freshwater discharge is reduced despite preserving river nutrient loads fig 8a the shrinkage occurs because the reduced discharge reduces the plume s extent and leads to more upstream concentrated n and p for biological recycling as a result under the lower freshwater discharge the declining p limitation impact steepens to reach the reversing point earlier fig 8b d also the p limitation impact shifts to slightly expanding the hypoxia for scenarios of lowest p limitation severity 70 n p and 80 n p in the 50 fw scenario fig 8f 4 discussion temporary p limitation of phytoplankton growth is more commonly observed in estuarine and coastal hypoxic systems fennel and testa 2019 due to rising anthropogenic nutrient contributions that elevate the n p ratio glibert et al 2013 however despite the potential importance of p limitation to hypoxia development observations of p limitation impact on coastal hypoxia are scarce primarily due to the difficulty in observing the effect quantitative assessment of p limitation impact on hypoxia thus largely relies on numerical modeling but such assessment is currently limited to few hypoxic systems laurent and fennel 2014 2017 fennel and laurent 2018 as a result it remains unsettled why p limitation is considered to aggravate hypoxia in some systems conley 1999 paerl et al 2004 but mitigate hypoxia in others laurent and fennel 2014 laurent and fennel 2017 proposed that the effect of p limitation may be related to a specific system s geometry where p limitation is more likely to amplify hypoxia in one dimensional flow through systems e g neuse river estuary but tend to alleviate hypoxia in open dispersive systems e g northern gulf of mexico affected by mississippi river plume while the proposal helps explain the contrasting effects of p limitation on hypoxia among different systems question remains at whether and why the effect can contrast in the same hypoxic system e g scavia and donnelly 2007 laurent and fennel 2014 combining observations and results from a coupled physical biogeochemical model off a large eutrophic estuary during summer upwelling conditions we validate the hypothesis that the impact of p limitation reverses from suppressing coastal hypoxia to amplifying hypoxia when p limitation severity decreases fig 1 we show that the reversal is independent of a system s hydrodynamic conditions it is driven by the interacting limitation induced changes in the surface primary production and the shoreward bottom oxygen influx when p limitation is severe or spatially extensive the downstream diluted primary production reduces the bottom oxygen sink in most of the plume impacted waters and enhances the shoreward bottom oxygen influx because of the increased downstream oxygen level these effects jointly reduce hypoxia in the entire coastal system when p limitation severity is lower or spatially constrained while the diluted production mitigates upstream hypoxia by lowering the bottom oxygen sink the primary production relocates downstream and increases oxygen consumption and hence hypoxia downstream the reduced bottom oxygen downstream subsequently reduces the shoreward oxygen influx that could otherwise alleviate upstream bottom hypoxia as a result the net effect of lower p limitation severity amplifies hypoxia in the ecosystem the reversing impact of p limitation on coastal hypoxia has important management implications for pre and other hypoxic systems the pre is an outstanding example of a large eutrophic estuary under the present excessively high river din and dip loads with a high n p ratio 100 p is the dominant limiting nutrient in most of the water affected by the river plume off the pre during summer however although a high n p ratio prevails in the inner estuary and the neighboring ctz where hypoxia is prone to develop p limitation in the inner estuary and ctz remains weak owing to the high din and dip levels contributed by the pearl river the p limitation intensifies along the plume s path due to the biological uptake of n and p at the redfield ratio this substantial p limitation has long been reported to suppress primary production and is suspected to reduce hypoxia in the pre during summer yin et al 2004 2011 yin and harrison 2008 our modeling investigation confirms that p limitation markedly suppresses primary production and hypoxia however we show that the weakened hypoxia is not simply a vertical local process that is the suppressed surface primary production reduces the net subsurface oxygen sink and elevates the bottom oxygen concentration instead the enhanced shoreward oxygen influx due to the elevated downstream bottom oxygen level which is an external horizontal process plays an equally important role as the vertical processes in alleviating hypoxia furthermore because the impact of p limitation on hypoxia reverses when p limitation severity is relatively low the nutrient management strategy based on impact assessments should not be static but should adapt to changing nutrient limitation conditions when the nutrient reduction strategies take effect our work also suggests that the spatial extent of p limitation which is relatively easy to measure can be used as a proxy to predict whether the impact of p limitation amplifies or relieves coastal hypoxia the spatial extent can guide nutrient management for a specific system generally the more spatially constrained the p limitation is equivalent to the more rapid transition from p limited to n limited condition along the plume s path the more likely the limitation is to amplify hypoxia this is because in a less severe p limitation scenario the limitation induced hypoxia reduction upstream would be slight while the excess n transported downstream would effectively fuel the n limited water to enhance hypoxia downstream lastly like all modeling studies there exist uncertainties in our model simulations for example our model does not include the nutrients of a high n p ratio delivered by submarine groundwater dai et al 2021 that may aggravate p limitation in addition the model does not account for the use of organic phosphorus as an alternative p source for phytoplankton growth li et al 2017 or the release of iron bound p from sediments during hypoxic conditions both processes may alleviate the p limitation future work is needed to understand and quantify the contributions of these different sources and types of phosphorus to the impact of p limitation on coastal hypoxia nonetheless considering the complexity of the processes involved the scarcity of observations and the large uncertainties in model parameterization focusing on the dominant p source i e riverine dip as in our and previous modeling assessments e g laurent et al 2014 2017 is a necessary step to simulating more realistic p dynamics and p limitation impact on coastal hypoxia 5 conclusion by combining observations with numerical results from a 3d physical biogeochemical model off the pearl river estuary we illustrate that during the summer upwelling period the effect of p limitation on coastal hypoxia can reverse from suppression to amplification due to interacting changes in surface primary production and shoreward bottom oxygen influx under high versus low p limitation severity we highlight the role of altering shoreward bottom oxygen influx in modulating the effect of p limitation on coastal hypoxia which has had less historical attention than the downstream diluted production in p limitation impact assessments finally we show that the spatial extent of p limitation can be a useful proxy to predict the impact of p limitation on coastal hypoxia and guide nutrient management in an affected estuarine and coastal system funding this work was supported by the

16256,persulfate activation through electron transfer from humic substances hs was investigated persulfate consumption in the presence of standard hs and hs model compounds linearly correlated with the phenol contents of the hs redox active carbonyl groups such as aromatic ketones and quinone also contributed to persulfate consumption by donating electrons while being reduced phenols activated persulfate through direct electron transfer from the phenolate forms but reduced ketones activated persulfate through reactions between their organic radicals and persulfate persulfate was activated more by terrestrially derived aquatic hs containing large numbers of phenol groups than by other species and this caused more benzene oxidation to occur in the presence of terrestrially derived aquatic hs than in the presence of other species larger amounts of sulfate radicals were scavenged by soil derived hs than other types of hs because soil derived hs were composed of larger molecules than other types of hs the fluorescence regional integration volume for hs reacted with persulfate linearly correlated with persulfate consumption decreases in the fluorescence regional integration value could be used to predict persulfate activation through electron transfer from hs to persulfate if the electron donating capacity cannot be determined persulfate activation by hs is expected to be stoichiometrically more advantageous than conventional persulfate fe2 processes when treating an aquifer containing large amounts of electron rich hs graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction aquifer contamination by organic pollutants has been considered to be one of the major threats to drinking water management in the past decades siegrist et al 2011 liu et al 2014 among treatment technologies developed for abating aquifer contaminants in situ chemical oxidation isco was reported to be advantageous over the other technologies due to its moderate cost and rapid complete nature of treatment siegrist et al 2011 waldemer et al 2007 isco can be conducted by injecting various oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide permanganate and persulfate to the contaminated source zone in the aquifer kakarla et al 2002 li and schwartz 2004 bruton and sedlak 2017 in recent decades persulfate s2o8 2 gained interest as an effective oxidant for isco because it is very reactive with various organic contaminants and is stable in aquifers sra et al 2010 tsitonaki et al 2010 cavanagh et al 2014 persulfate can be activated to give the sulfate radical so4 which rapidly oxidizes organic pollutants including petroleum hydrocarbons liang et al 2008 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons peluffo et al 2016 and pharmaceuticals park et al 2018 in soil and groundwater energy sources such as uv light qian et al 2015 heat bruton and sedlak 2017 and microwaves qi et al 2014 have been used to activate persulfate transition metals ferrous ions peng et al 2017 copper ions liu

macalady and walton day 2011 hs has generally been known to scavenge hydroxyl radicals oh and therefore inhibit the oxidation of target pollutants during conventional advanced oxidation processes lee and von gunten 2010 mckay et al 2011 donham et al 2014 in addition to the role of hs as a radical scavenger several literature reported that hs have also been found to be able to produce oh radicals even in non irradiated aquatic environments page et al 2012 2013 liao et al 2019 page et al 2012 found that reduced hs produced hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals by reducing oxygen under sub oxic conditions like the different roles hs play in oh based processes hs also play divergent roles in persulfate based oxidation processes hs usually act as radical scavengers in activated persulfate systems luo et al 2016 dhaka et al 2017 wang et al 2019 in the absence of an activator electron rich functional groups in hs activate persulfate through electron transfer eq 1 in a similar way to activation by transition metals ahmad et al 2013 found that the phenolate anion can activate persulfate through electron transfer eq 2 rather than reduction by the hydroperoxyl radical anion ho2 which is produced after nucleophilic attack of phenolate on persulfate the semiquinone radical anion produced through comproportionation of benzoquinone and hydroquinone can also reduce persulfate to give so4 eq 3 fang et al 2013 however persulfate activation by electron rich functional groups in hs is expected to play only a minor role in pollutant oxidation because the functional groups themselves are radical scavengers lee et al 2020 1 s 2 o 8 2 hs so 4 so 4 2 hs oxidized 2 3 reactions between persulfate and hs need to be investigated further because of the two different roles hs play in persulfate based oxidation and because the mechanisms involved have not been thoroughly investigated the capacities of specific moieties in hs to act as persulfate activators or radical scavengers remain poorly understood it is possible to determine the phenol contents of hs ritchie and perdue 2003 but the persulfate activation potentials of redox active carbonyl moieties such as quinones and aromatic ketones wang and ma 2020 have not yet been assessed these redox active carbonyl moieties can be transformed into electron rich moieties in a reducing aquifer environment eqs 4 and 5 reactions between persulfate and hs in a pollutant source zone can be important during isco electron rich hs are frequently present in isco target areas because of microbial decomposition of organic pollutants at sufficiently high concentrations such as petroleum hydrocarbons and landfill leachate leenheer et al 2003 dvorski et al 2016 the role of electron rich hs becomes important when aquifer heterogeneity hampers delivery of chemical activators or energy to the area where persulfate and the target pollutants exist which will eventually result in insufficient persulfate activation 4 5 the aim of this study was to investigate the reactions between persulfate and hs with a focus on the electron donating capacities of and functional groups in hs the persulfate activation and radical scavenging capacities of hs were assessed by performing experiments using three different classes of hs microbially derived hs terrestrially derived aquatic hs and soil derived hs the different types of hs had different electron donating and electron accepting capacities aeschbacher et al 2012 and were expected to have different persulfate activation and radical scavenging capacities changes in the optical properties of the hs were monitored because changes in the chromophore composition may shed light on the redox reactions of hs during hs persulfate reactions the stoichiometries of the activation scavenging reactions between persulfate and specific hs moieties were investigated using hs model compounds containing known amounts of electron rich substances e g phenols and hydroquinones and their complimentary electron withdrawing counterparts e g aromatic ketones and quinones the results were used to assess the feasibility of hs activated persulfate processes being

the other aliquot was used as a source for modified reduced hs or model compound chemical reduction of hs or model compound was carried out by adding 260 mg of sodium borohydride to the aliquots for reduced system the number of moles of sodium borohydride added was 10 times higher than the number of moles of hs or model compound in the solution to ensure that the electron accepting moieties in the hs or model compound were completely reduced after 24 h boric acid was added to adjust the solution to ph 8 2 and remove the remaining borohydride the total organic carbon toc concentrations in the pristine and reduced solutions were determined then each solution was diluted to give a stock solution of the hs or model compound at a concentration of 200 mg c l each stock solution was analyzed by uv vis spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy as described below 2 3 reactions between persulfate and hs activation of persulfate by the hs and model compounds pristine and reduced was investigated by performing benzene oxidation tests sodium persulfate was dissolved in di water to give a stock solution at a concentration of 100 mm benzene was added to di water to give a stock solution at a concentration of 20 mm water and the benzene persulfate and selected hs or model compound stock solutions were added to an amber bottle to give a mixture containing 5 mm benzene 10 mm persulfate and 50 mg c l of the selected hs or model compound the mixture was immediately transferred to a 40 ml amber vial leaving no headspace then the vial was sealed with a ptfe lined cap a series of such vials was prepared for each of the hs and model compounds the benzene concentrations in two 40 ml vials for each of the hs and model compounds were determined at each selected sampling time control samples containing only benzene and persulfate i e not containing hs or model compounds were also prepared mixtures of hs and model compounds and persulfate i e not containing benzene were prepared and analyzed to identify the effects of persulfate on the optical properties of the hs and model compounds because benzene and its transformation byproducts may have interfered with the spectroscopic analyses of the hs and model compounds all the tests were conducted at room temperature controlled at 22 1 c the systems in which pristine hs and model compounds were oxidized by persulfate are later called oxidized systems and the systems in which reduced hs and model compounds were oxidized by persulfate are called reduced oxidized systems 2 4 measurements and analyses benzene was determined using a high performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a uv detector spd 20a shimadzu japan and a poroshell 120 c18 column agilent technologies usa isocratic elution was performed using a mixture of 20 methanol and 80 water as the mobile phase persulfate was determined using a colorimetric method described in a previous publication kim et al 2018a briefly an aqueous sample was added to a bicarbonate buffered iodide solution then the solution was mixed after 20 min absorbance of light at a wavelength of 400 nm was determined using an optizen pop uv vis spectrometer mecasys korea absorbance of light in the wavelength range 190 800 nm by the hs or model compound in each sample was determined with baseline correction for absorption by di water containing 50 mm borate absorbance by persulfate corresponding the persulfate concentration found in the sample was subtracted from the spectrum for the hs in each sample the specific uv absorbance suva at a wavelength of 254 nm was calculated by dividing the absorbance value by the toc concentration the suva values were used to quantitatively compare the absorbances of the samples and predict the redox states of the hs for example the suva was expected to increase when hq was oxidized to bq because the molar absorption coefficient at 254 nm is higher for bq than hq wenk et al 2013 analogously the changes in the suva were used to indicate oxidation reduction of phenol carbonyl group pairs in the hs and model compounds the toc concentrations were determined using a sievers 5310c toc analyzer usa fluorescence spectroscopy was performed using an ls 55 spectrofluorometer perkinelmer usa excitation emission matrix eem data for the excitation range 250 400 nm with a wavelength step of 5 nm and the emission wavelength range 280 550 nm with a wavelength step of 0 5 nm were acquired the entrance and exit slits of the monochromators were 10 nm wide each sample was diluted as appropriate to avoid inner filter effects the spectra were normalized using the toc and di water raman peak areas the fluorescence intensities in the eems are presented as raman units ru 2 5 fluorescence eem regional integration fluorescence regional integration fri of eems was performed to allow the eems of the hs samples to be quantitatively compared chen et al 2003 he and hur 2013 eem data and parallel factor analysis parafac provide valuable quantitative information about changes in the characteristics of hs during radical based oxidation processes phong and hur 2015 but we did not have the number of samples required to construct a robust model eem fri was therefore used because fewer eem measurements were required the fri parameters were calculated using the approach originally developed by chen et al 2003 with slight modifications to the fri region classification system each eem was divided into four regions defined in fig s1 of appendix a the normalized excitation emission area volume of region i vi n was calculated using the equation 6 v v i n e x e m i Œª e x Œª e m Œ¥ Œª e x Œ¥ Œª e m a i f where i Œªex Œªem is the fluorescence intensity in ru for a specified data point Œ¥Œªex and Œ¥Œªem are the excitation and emission wavelength intervals respectively and ai f is the fractional area of region i the total fri volume vt n and the percentage fluorescence response pi n were calculated using eqs 7 and 8 7 v t n i 1 4 v i n 8 p i n v i n v t n 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 persulfate consumption more persulfate was consumed in the systems containing hs or hs model compounds except the system containing umrn discussed later than in the control system which contained only benzene fig 1 a this indicated that electron rich moieties in hs accelerate persulfate activation by donating electrons and or initiating radical chain reactions ahmad et al 2013 liu et al 2016 the differences in the amounts of persulfate consumed in the systems containing hs and the control system 1 3 mm shown as a dotted line in fig 1 were ascribed to persulfate being activated by the hs persulfate consumption in the control system was caused by thermal dissociation of persulfate to yield the sulfate radical the phenol group contents of the hs table s2 and model compounds text s1 and table s1 linearly correlated with the amount of persulfate consumed we therefore assumed that phenol groups in hs play important roles in persulfate activation by donating electrons even though the amount of persulfate consumed and the phenol content strongly correlated not all of the phenol groups in the hs may have been able to donate electrons directly to persulfate the electron donation process is affected by the ph for example the phenol group in sa has a pka of 13 6 so will not be in the phenolate form to an appreciable degree at ph 8 2 eq 2 accordingly we found that only a small amount of persulfate was consumed in the sa system fig 1 a the exceptionally high amount of persulfate consumed in the presence of bq was probably caused by activation by semiquinone radical anions eq 3 formed through comproportionation of bq and hq fang et al 2013 in addition to activation of persulfate by phenol groups in the reduced model compound systems reduced quinone and ketone compounds appeared to have contributed to persulfate consumption in the same way as phenol groups contributed in the pristine hs and model compound systems because the phenol plus quinone and ketone group contents strongly correlated with the amount of persulfate consumed fig 1 b this suggested that like phenol groups quinone and ketone groups donated electrons to persulfate after being reduced by bh4 to their respective hydroquinone and alcohol forms phenol groups formed through the reduction of quinones in the bq and jl systems directly reduced persulfate eq 2 because at least 2 of the phenol groups in these systems would have been dissociated see the pka values in table s1 in the reduced ap and bp systems however it is unlikely that electrons were transferred from the secondary alcohols 1 phenylethanol and diphenylmethanol respectively formed through reduction of the ketone groups in the model compounds to persulfate because these secondary alcohols have extremely high pka values 13 and would not have been in dissociated forms the linear correlations involving the amounts of persulfate consumed in the reduced ap and bp systems indicated that persulfate consumption mechanisms other than direct electron transfer from reduced ketones to persulfate occurred the increased persulfate consumption in the presence of secondary alcohols was most likely caused by persulfate being reduced by organic radicals produced through reactions between sulfate radicals and secondary alcohols eqs 9 and 10 such as the oxidation of 1 phenylethanol to give ap mcisaac and edwards 1969 the pa and trp systems consumed similar amounts of persulfate to the control systems because pa and trp are not redox active like phenol quinones and ketones 9 10 the amounts of persulfate consumed per hs functional group equivalent calculated from the slope of the linear regression were 0 89 mol eq for the pristine hs systems and 0 95 mol eq for the reduced systems these values are similar to the theoretical values for the stoichiometric equations 1 mol eq in which one oh group donates one electron to persulfate to give a sulfate radical however complete utilization of oh to reduce persulfate was not likely to have occurred because the oh groups could also be oxidized by sulfate radicals produced through the reduction of persulfate by hs the amount of sulfate radicals used to oxidize benzene would therefore be expected to be smaller than the amount of persulfate consumed through the scavenging of sulfate radicals by oh groups in hs 3 2 benzene oxidation the phenol group contents of the hs and model compound systems did not correlate with the amounts of benzene oxidized the regression line is not shown in fig 2 a even though the phenol group contents and amounts of persulfate consumed significantly correlated markedly more benzene was oxidized in the ga and hq systems than in the control systems in which benzene was oxidized by sulfate radicals produced through thermal dissociation of persulfate fig 2 a the high phenol group contents of the ga and hq systems probably contributed to the production of sulfate radicals that oxidized benzene however no more benzene was oxidized in the presence of the hs and other model compounds than in the controls in particular the amount of benzene that was oxidized in the ta system was not markedly higher than the amount oxidized in the controls even though the ta system contained a similar amount of phenol groups to the ga and hq systems and consumed markedly more persulfate than the controls fig 1 a the systems containing sa tyr and jl model compounds containing phenol groups also did not oxidize markedly more benzene than the controls the amount of benzene that was oxidized did not significantly correlate with the sum of the contents of the three redox active groups phenol quinone and ketone groups fig 2 b like the ga and hq systems the reduced bq system oxidized a large amount of benzene it was clear that the reduction process transformed bq into hq and this explained the relatively high reactivity of the reduced bq system similar amounts of benzene were oxidized in both the pristine and reduced ga ta and hq systems the phenol group content of the jl system was expected to have tripled during the reduction process because the borohydride would have reduced the quinone groups in jl however the amount of benzene that was oxidized in the reduced jl system was not higher than the amount of benzene that was oxidized in the controls the stoichiometries of the benzene oxidation reactions involving the redox active groups were assessed by fitting linear regressions to plots of the data for the systems in which markedly more benzene was oxidized than in the control systems i e the pristine ga and hq systems and the reduced ga bp ap bq and hq systems see fig s2 the stoichiometric ratio for benzene oxidation by a redox active group was 0 47 this indicated that one mole of an electron donating group in the systems mentioned above yielded 0 47 mol of sulfate radicals that could oxidize benzene assuming that negligible side reactions e g sulfate radical reactions with benzene oxidation products occurred liu et al 2016 the discrepancy between this stoichiometric ratio 0 47 and the stoichiometric ratios of 0 86 and 0 95 for persulfate consumption related to the redox active group contents fig 1 indicated that persulfate consumption by the hs and the model compounds did not always create sulfate radicals required to oxidize benzene the compounds bearing phenol groups except ga and hq generally gave much lower stoichiometric ratios for benzene oxidation and phenol group contents than ga and hq this indicated that the sulfate radical scavenging capacities of these compounds were higher than the persulfate activation capacities of the compounds notably the ta and reduced jl systems which had relatively large phenol group contents and therefore consumed large amounts of persulfate did not oxidize large amounts of benzene relative to the controls sulfate radicals are probably more efficiently scavenged by larger molecules such as ta than smaller molecules we therefore predicted that sulfate radicals might be more efficiently scavenged by phenolic moieties in higher molecular weight hs than phenolic moieties in lower molecular weight hs slightly larger amounts of sulfate radicals that could oxidize benzene were produced in the reduced bp and ap systems than in the control system fig 2b this implied that reduced ketones contributed more to activating persulfate than to scavenging sulfate radicals 3 3 stoichiometry of persulfate consumption and benzene oxidation in the presence of hs the amount of benzene that was oxidized per unit of persulfate consumed in the presence of the hs was always lower than in the control system fig 3 this indicated that the hs scavenged more sulfate radicals than were produced through persulfate activation the terrestrially derived aquatic hs including the reduced srha and srfa systems contributed more than the other hs to benzene oxidation and consumed the most persulfate more benzene was also oxidized by the pristine srha and srfa systems than the other hs systems this supported the conclusion that phenol groups in hs play roles in activating persulfate and the subsequent oxidation of benzene because srha and srfa contain more phenol groups than do the other hs table s2 umrn had the lowest phenolic group content and consumed the least persulfate regardless of the redox state of the umrn this indicated that umrn as well as containing few phenol groups contained only small amounts of electron accepting groups that were reduced by the borohydride and could subsequently activate persulfate the benzene to persulfate stoichiometric ratios were lower for the three soil derived hs lha ppha and esha and plfa than for the other hs more sulfate radicals were scavenged by the soil derived hs than the other hs because the soil derived hs were composed of larger molecules that could more efficiently scavenge sulfate radicals than the smaller model compounds preferential reactions between sulfate radicals and high molecular weight hs have been found in previous studies e g cheng et al 2018 tian et al 2018 the low benzene persulfate stoichiometric ratio for the plfa which lacks phenolic moieties could have been caused by the presence of more protein like moieties such as tyr which would have consumed persulfate through electrophilic substitution without producing sulfate radicals behrman and bidinger 1989 this indicated that the types of redox active moieties in hs strongly affect the yields of sulfate radicals that can oxidize benzene after persulfate has been activated by the hs 3 4 spectroscopic characteristics of the hs the suva of ga ta and hq which contain phenol groups were markedly increased by reacting with persulfate figs s3 and s4 this was ascribed to the formation of quinone moieties through oxidation of the phenol groups by persulfate no clear changes in the uv vis absorbances of pa and sa were found to be caused by reacting with persulfate pa does not contain phenol groups that could activate persulfate so the uv vis absorbance of pa did not markedly change through the reaction between pa and persulfate the aromatic carboxyl groups in pa did not appear to be altered by oxidation by persulfate because changes in absorbance were not observed in any part of the spectrum fig s3b sa contains a phenol group that was not involved in persulfate activation as mentioned in section 3 1 and absorbance by sa was not affected by sa reacting with persulfate the absorbance of tyr did not change markedly through the reaction between tyr and persulfate even though tyr contains a phenol moiety this confirmed that the phenol structure in tyr does not participate in the activation of persulfate however absorbance between 200 and 225 nm by trp decreased because of the reaction between trp and persulfate indicating that chromophoric components of trp were altered an increase in absorbance at 250 nm however was probably caused by trp being transformed into aromatic ketone containing substances e g kynurenine through oxidation triquigneaux et al 2012 the suvas of substances containing quinone and aromatic ketone moieties ap bp bq and jl were consistently lower after than before the reduction process figs s3 and s4 this indicated that quinone and aromatic ketone moieties were reduced to their phenolic and secondary alcohol forms respectively reacting with persulfate increased the suva of these reduced model compounds markedly because quinone and aromatic ketone moieties formed the suva of reduced ap bp and bq however did not increase to their original values indicating that the subsequent oxidation of reduced quinone and aromatic ketones by persulfate was not completely reversible fractional suva changes were used to evaluate changes in the redox properties of the hs caused by the treatments fig 4 the suva values for the hs samples were lower after than before reduction with borohydride indicating that the carbonyl groups quinone and ketone in the hs were reduced to phenol groups and secondary alcohol groups the suva values of the terrestrially derived aquatic hs srha and srfa and soil derived hs ppha and esha but not lha were decreased markedly by the reduction process these hs probably have higher electron accepting capacities than the microbially derived hs plfa the fractional suva changes for the lha and the microbially derived hs were similar but the absolute decrease in the suva was higher for the lha than the microbially derived hs this was consistent with the results of a previous study in which higher electron accepting capacities were found for terrestrially derived hs than microbially derived hs aeschbacher et al 2012 the oxidation treatments caused the hs suva to increase because phenols and secondary alcohols in the hs were oxidized to carbonyl groups the srha and srfa systems in which the most benzene was oxidized and persulfate consumed had higher suva increases than did the other systems the absolute suva increases caused by reacting with persulfate were also higher for srha and srfa than for the microbially derived and soil derived hs fig s5 this indicated that phenol groups in srha and srfa reacted with persulfate and were oxidized to quinone groups when the hs reduced using borohydride were oxidized by persulfate the suva values returned to the original suva values for the pristine hs or even became higher than the original suva values except for esha however the suva values were lower for the reduced oxidized samples than the oxidized samples this indicated that oxidation by persulfate did not restore some reduced hs moieties to carbonyl groups for example the ap suva was only partly recovered by oxidizing the reduced system fig s4 this could explain the incomplete recoveries of the suva in the reduced oxidized hs further oxidation of carbonyl groups to carboxylic groups could also explain the suva being lower for the reduced oxidized systems than the oxidized systems the eem fluorescence intensities of all of the hs were higher after than before the reduction process figs s6 s12 and table s3 this was caused by quenching of electron accepting moieties in the hs ma et al 2010 phillips and smith 2014 kim et al 2018b blue shifted emission peaks in the eems of the reduced hs also indicated that the electron accepting moieties in the hs had been reduced yang et al 2016 the fluorescence peak intensities were lower for the oxidized hs than the pristine hs oxidation of the reduced hs increased the eem peak intensities the eem peak intensities changed more in the humic and fulvic like regions figs s5 s11 and table s3 than the other regions this indicated that humic and fulvic like moieties were mainly responsible for reacting with and reducing persulfate 3 5 fri volume changes for the hs the pi n values for region iv humic like and region iii fulvic like were 80 of the total fri volumes for the terrestrially derived aquatic hs and soil derived hs table s4 region i protein like and region ii microbially derived contributed up to 32 5 of the fri volumes for the microbially derived hs the pi n values for region i and region ii increased and the pi n of region iv decreased when the hs except umrn were reduced however oxidation and reduction oxidation did not markedly alter the pi n values for the different region this indicated that no hs moiety preferentially donated electrons to either persulfate or the sulfate radical correlations between changes in the fri volume and persulfate consumption were therefore assessed using the decreases in vt n values caused by reacting with persulfate oxidation or reduction oxidation rather than changes in the pi n values a linear correlation was found between the decrease in fri volume and the amount of persulfate consumed fig 5 this suggested that the decrease in fri volume could be used to evaluate electron transfer from hs to persulfate without measuring the electron donating capacities of the hs which would be relatively complicated chon et al 2015 electron transfers between redox active carbonyl and phenol moieties in hs and persulfate can be predicted from changes in the fri volume 4 conclusions the results indicated that phenol moieties in hs were mainly responsible for the consumption of persulfate and contributed to the production of sulfate radicals for oxidizing pollutants markedly more persulfate was consumed by the hs model compounds containing phenolate moieties than the hs model compounds containing other moieties redox active carbonyl groups such as aromatic ketones and quinone groups were also able to donate electrons to persulfate when those moieties were reduced however different mechanisms were involved in persulfate activation by reduced ketones secondary alcohols and by phenols because direct electron transfer from reduced ketones to persulfate is not likely more persulfate was consumed and more sulfate radicals were produced by terrestrially derived aquatic hs srha and srfa which contain large numbers of phenol groups than by hs from other sources more sulfate radicals were scavenged by soil derived hs which contain larger molecules than other hs than by lower molecular weight hs the decrease in fri volume for the hs linearly correlated with the amount of persulfate consumed so the decrease in fri volume could be used to represent electron transfer from hs to persulfate when electron donating capacity measurements cannot readily be performed persulfate activation by hs was less beneficial than thermal activation in the control system in terms of the stoichiometry of pollutant oxidation and persulfate consumption even though it was found in previous studies that pollutants can be oxidized faster by hs activated persulfate than in systems not containing hs this was because the hs scavenged more sulfate radicals than they produced by activating persulfate however the yield of radicals used for oxidizing contaminants in the reduced srha system was 0 16 mol per mole of persulfate which was higher than for the conventional persulfate fe2 system 0 13 mol of so4 per mole of s2o8 2 kim et al 2018a this indicated that activating persulfate using hs could be stoichiometrically advantageous over activating persulfate using fe2 if an aquifer contains high concentrations of organic pollutants e g petroleum hydrocarbons that have high electron rich hs contents and the conditions are reducing eganhouse et al 1993 we previously found that nanosized zero valent iron nzvi effectively reduced electron accepting moieties in srha kim et al 2018b the hs activated persulfate system could be used downgradient of the nzvi reactive zone hs from upgradient would be expected to be reduced by the nzvi and the reduced hs would effectively activate persulfate and cause untreated organic pollutants to be removed eq 6 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

16256,persulfate activation through electron transfer from humic substances hs was investigated persulfate consumption in the presence of standard hs and hs model compounds linearly correlated with the phenol contents of the hs redox active carbonyl groups such as aromatic ketones and quinone also contributed to persulfate consumption by donating electrons while being reduced phenols activated persulfate through direct electron transfer from the phenolate forms but reduced ketones activated persulfate through reactions between their organic radicals and persulfate persulfate was activated more by terrestrially derived aquatic hs containing large numbers of phenol groups than by other species and this caused more benzene oxidation to occur in the presence of terrestrially derived aquatic hs than in the presence of other species larger amounts of sulfate radicals were scavenged by soil derived hs than other types of hs because soil derived hs were composed of larger molecules than other types of hs the fluorescence regional integration volume for hs reacted with persulfate linearly correlated with persulfate consumption decreases in the fluorescence regional integration value could be used to predict persulfate activation through electron transfer from hs to persulfate if the electron donating capacity cannot be determined persulfate activation by hs is expected to be stoichiometrically more advantageous than conventional persulfate fe2 processes when treating an aquifer containing large amounts of electron rich hs graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction aquifer contamination by organic pollutants has been considered to be one of the major threats to drinking water management in the past decades siegrist et al 2011 liu et al 2014 among treatment technologies developed for abating aquifer contaminants in situ chemical oxidation isco was reported to be advantageous over the other technologies due to its moderate cost and rapid complete nature of treatment siegrist et al 2011 waldemer et al 2007 isco can be conducted by injecting various oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide permanganate and persulfate to the contaminated source zone in the aquifer kakarla et al 2002 li and schwartz 2004 bruton and sedlak 2017 in recent decades persulfate s2o8 2 gained interest as an effective oxidant for isco because it is very reactive with various organic contaminants and is stable in aquifers sra et al 2010 tsitonaki et al 2010 cavanagh et al 2014 persulfate can be activated to give the sulfate radical so4 which rapidly oxidizes organic pollutants including petroleum hydrocarbons liang et al 2008 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons peluffo et al 2016 and pharmaceuticals park et al 2018 in soil and groundwater energy sources such as uv light qian et al 2015 heat bruton and sedlak 2017 and microwaves qi et al 2014 have been used to activate persulfate transition metals ferrous ions peng et al 2017 copper ions liu et al 2012 nanosized zero valent iron kim et al 2018a and iron oxide minerals teel et al 2011 liu et al 2016 have also been suggested to be suitable for activating persulfate to achieve isco humic substances hs contain various electron withdrawing groups e g quinone and electron donating groups e g phenol and play important roles in natural and engineered redox processes aeschbacher et al 2010 macalady and walton day 2011 hs has generally been known to scavenge hydroxyl radicals oh and therefore inhibit the oxidation of target pollutants during conventional advanced oxidation processes lee and von gunten 2010 mckay et al 2011 donham et al 2014 in addition to the role of hs as a radical scavenger several literature reported that hs have also been found to be able to produce oh radicals even in non irradiated aquatic environments page et al 2012 2013 liao et al 2019 page et al 2012 found that reduced hs produced hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals by reducing oxygen under sub oxic conditions like the different roles hs play in oh based processes hs also play divergent roles in persulfate based oxidation processes hs usually act as radical scavengers in activated persulfate systems luo et al 2016 dhaka et al 2017 wang et al 2019 in the absence of an activator electron rich functional groups in hs activate persulfate through electron transfer eq 1 in a similar way to activation by transition metals ahmad et al 2013 found that the phenolate anion can activate persulfate through electron transfer eq 2 rather than reduction by the hydroperoxyl radical anion ho2 which is produced after nucleophilic attack of phenolate on persulfate the semiquinone radical anion produced through comproportionation of benzoquinone and hydroquinone can also reduce persulfate to give so4 eq 3 fang et al 2013 however persulfate activation by electron rich functional groups in hs is expected to play only a minor role in pollutant oxidation because the functional groups themselves are radical scavengers lee et al 2020 1 s 2 o 8 2 hs so 4 so 4 2 hs oxidized 2 3 reactions between persulfate and hs need to be investigated further because of the two different roles hs play in persulfate based oxidation and because the mechanisms involved have not been thoroughly investigated the capacities of specific moieties in hs to act as persulfate activators or radical scavengers remain poorly understood it is possible to determine the phenol contents of hs ritchie and perdue 2003 but the persulfate activation potentials of redox active carbonyl moieties such as quinones and aromatic ketones wang and ma 2020 have not yet been assessed these redox active carbonyl moieties can be transformed into electron rich moieties in a reducing aquifer environment eqs 4 and 5 reactions between persulfate and hs in a pollutant source zone can be important during isco electron rich hs are frequently present in isco target areas because of microbial decomposition of organic pollutants at sufficiently high concentrations such as petroleum hydrocarbons and landfill leachate leenheer et al 2003 dvorski et al 2016 the role of electron rich hs becomes important when aquifer heterogeneity hampers delivery of chemical activators or energy to the area where persulfate and the target pollutants exist which will eventually result in insufficient persulfate activation 4 5 the aim of this study was to investigate the reactions between persulfate and hs with a focus on the electron donating capacities of and functional groups in hs the persulfate activation and radical scavenging capacities of hs were assessed by performing experiments using three different classes of hs microbially derived hs terrestrially derived aquatic hs and soil derived hs the different types of hs had different electron donating and electron accepting capacities aeschbacher et al 2012 and were expected to have different persulfate activation and radical scavenging capacities changes in the optical properties of the hs were monitored because changes in the chromophore composition may shed light on the redox reactions of hs during hs persulfate reactions the stoichiometries of the activation scavenging reactions between persulfate and specific hs moieties were investigated using hs model compounds containing known amounts of electron rich substances e g phenols and hydroquinones and their complimentary electron withdrawing counterparts e g aromatic ketones and quinones the results were used to assess the feasibility of hs activated persulfate processes being involved in isco 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals deionized di water 18 2 mœâ cm produced using a barnstead nanopure diamond system thermo fisher scientific usa was used in all of the tests

model compounds stock solutions of the seven standard hs and eleven hs model compounds were prepared as described below di water buffered to ph 8 2 with 50 mm borate was purged with n2 to remove dissolved oxygen and was then used for all of the batch tests dilutions and blank measurements unless otherwise specified the procedures described below were performed in an anaerobic chamber coy laboratory products usa to avoid the hs redox state changing because of exposure to by atmospheric oxygen and to simulate the environment in an anoxic aquifer a solution of each of the seven standard

hs and model compound solution was divided into two 250 ml aliquots and each aliquot was stored in an amber bottle one aliquot was used as a source of the unmodified pristine hs or model compound and the other aliquot was used as a source for modified reduced hs or model compound chemical reduction of hs or model compound was carried out by adding 260 mg of sodium borohydride to the aliquots for reduced system the number of moles of sodium borohydride added was 10 times higher than the number of moles of hs or model compound in the solution to ensure that the electron accepting moieties in the hs or model compound were completely reduced after 24 h boric acid was added to adjust the solution to ph 8 2 and remove the remaining borohydride the total organic carbon toc concentrations in the pristine and reduced solutions were determined then each solution was diluted to give a stock solution of the hs or model compound at a concentration of 200 mg c l each stock solution was analyzed

persulfate and 50 mg c l of the selected hs or model compound the mixture was immediately transferred to a 40 ml amber vial leaving no headspace then the vial was sealed with a ptfe lined cap a series of such vials was prepared for each of the hs and model compounds the benzene concentrations in two 40 ml vials for each of the hs and model compounds were determined at each selected sampling time control samples containing only benzene and persulfate i e not containing hs or model compounds were also prepared mixtures of hs and model compounds and persulfate i e not containing benzene were prepared and analyzed to identify the effects of persulfate on the optical properties of the hs and model compounds because benzene and its transformation byproducts may have interfered with the spectroscopic analyses of the hs and model compounds all the tests were conducted at room temperature controlled at 22 1 c the systems in which pristine hs and model compounds were oxidized by persulfate are later called oxidized systems and the systems in which reduced hs and model compounds were oxidized by persulfate are called reduced oxidized systems 2 4 measurements and analyses benzene was determined using a high performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a uv detector spd 20a shimadzu japan and a poroshell 120 c18 column agilent technologies usa isocratic elution was performed using a mixture of 20 methanol and 80 water as the mobile phase persulfate was determined using a colorimetric method described in a previous publication kim et al 2018a briefly an aqueous sample was added to a bicarbonate buffered iodide solution then the solution was mixed after 20 min absorbance of light at a wavelength of 400 nm was determined using an optizen pop uv vis spectrometer mecasys korea absorbance of light in the wavelength range 190 800 nm by the hs or model compound in each sample was determined with baseline correction for absorption by di water containing 50 mm borate absorbance by persulfate corresponding the persulfate concentration found in the sample was subtracted from the spectrum for the hs in each sample the specific uv absorbance suva at a wavelength of 254 nm was calculated by dividing the absorbance value by the toc concentration the suva values were used to quantitatively compare the absorbances of the samples and predict the redox states of the hs for example the suva was expected to increase when hq was oxidized to bq because the molar absorption coefficient at 254 nm is higher for bq than hq wenk et al 2013 analogously the changes in the suva were used to indicate oxidation reduction of phenol carbonyl group pairs in the hs and model compounds the toc concentrations were determined using a sievers 5310c toc analyzer usa fluorescence spectroscopy was performed using an ls 55 spectrofluorometer perkinelmer usa excitation emission matrix eem data for the excitation range 250 400 nm with a wavelength step of 5 nm and the emission wavelength range 280 550 nm with a wavelength step of 0 5 nm were acquired the entrance and exit slits of the monochromators were 10 nm wide each sample was diluted as appropriate to avoid inner filter effects the spectra were normalized using the toc and di water raman peak areas the fluorescence intensities in the eems are presented as raman units ru 2 5 fluorescence eem regional integration fluorescence regional integration fri of eems was performed to allow the eems of the hs samples to be quantitatively compared chen et al 2003 he and hur 2013 eem data and parallel factor analysis parafac provide valuable quantitative information about changes in the characteristics of hs during radical based oxidation processes phong and hur 2015 but we did not have the number of samples required to construct a robust model eem fri was therefore used because fewer eem measurements were required the fri parameters were calculated using the approach originally developed by chen et al 2003 with slight modifications to the fri region classification system each eem was divided into four regions defined in fig s1 of appendix a the normalized excitation emission area volume of region i vi n was calculated using the equation 6 v v i n e x e m i Œª e x Œª e m Œ¥ Œª e x Œ¥ Œª e m a i f where i Œªex Œªem is the fluorescence intensity in ru for a specified data point Œ¥Œªex and Œ¥Œªem are the excitation and emission wavelength intervals respectively and ai f is the fractional area of region i the total fri volume vt n and the percentage fluorescence response pi n were calculated using eqs 7 and 8 7 v t n i 1 4 v i n 8 p i n v i n v t n 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 persulfate consumption more persulfate was consumed in the systems containing hs or hs model compounds except the system containing umrn discussed later than in the control system which contained only benzene fig 1 a this indicated that electron rich moieties in hs accelerate persulfate activation by donating electrons and or initiating radical chain reactions ahmad et al 2013 liu et al 2016 the differences in the amounts of persulfate consumed in the systems containing hs and the control system 1 3 mm shown as a dotted line in fig 1 were ascribed to persulfate being activated by the hs persulfate consumption in the control system was caused by thermal dissociation of persulfate to yield the sulfate radical the phenol group contents of the hs table s2 and model compounds text s1 and table s1 linearly correlated with the amount of persulfate consumed we therefore assumed that phenol groups in hs play important roles in persulfate activation by donating electrons even though the amount of persulfate consumed and the phenol content strongly correlated not all of the phenol groups in the hs may have been able to donate electrons directly to persulfate the electron donation process is affected by the ph for example the phenol group in sa has a pka of 13 6 so will not be in the phenolate form to an appreciable degree at ph 8 2 eq 2 accordingly we found that only a small amount of persulfate was consumed in the sa system fig 1 a the exceptionally high amount of persulfate consumed in the presence of bq was probably caused by activation by semiquinone radical anions eq 3 formed through comproportionation of bq and hq fang et al 2013 in addition to activation of persulfate by phenol groups in the reduced model compound systems reduced quinone and ketone compounds appeared to have contributed to persulfate consumption in the same way as phenol groups contributed in the pristine hs and model compound systems because the phenol plus quinone and ketone group contents strongly correlated with the amount of persulfate consumed fig 1 b this suggested that like phenol groups quinone and ketone groups donated electrons to persulfate after being reduced by bh4 to their respective hydroquinone and alcohol forms phenol groups formed through the reduction of quinones in the bq and jl systems directly reduced persulfate eq 2 because at least 2 of the phenol groups in these systems would have been dissociated see the pka values in table s1 in the reduced ap and bp systems however it is unlikely that electrons were transferred from the secondary alcohols 1 phenylethanol and diphenylmethanol respectively formed through reduction of the ketone groups in the model compounds to persulfate because these secondary alcohols have extremely high pka values 13 and would not have been in dissociated forms the linear correlations involving the amounts of persulfate consumed in the reduced ap and bp systems indicated that persulfate consumption mechanisms other than direct electron transfer from reduced ketones to persulfate occurred the increased persulfate consumption in the presence of secondary alcohols was most likely caused by persulfate being reduced by organic radicals produced through reactions between sulfate radicals and secondary alcohols eqs 9 and 10 such as the oxidation of 1 phenylethanol to give ap mcisaac and edwards 1969 the pa and trp systems consumed similar amounts of persulfate to the control systems because pa and trp are not redox active like phenol quinones and ketones 9 10 the amounts of persulfate consumed per hs functional group equivalent calculated from the slope of the linear regression were 0 89 mol eq for the pristine hs systems and 0 95 mol eq for the reduced systems these values are similar to the theoretical values for the stoichiometric equations 1 mol eq in which one oh group donates one electron to persulfate to give a sulfate radical however complete utilization of oh to reduce persulfate was not likely to have occurred because the oh groups could also be oxidized by sulfate radicals produced through the reduction of persulfate by hs the amount of sulfate radicals used to oxidize benzene would therefore be expected to be smaller than the amount of persulfate consumed through the scavenging of sulfate radicals by oh groups in hs 3 2 benzene oxidation the phenol group contents of the hs and model compound systems did not correlate with the amounts of benzene oxidized the regression line is not shown in fig 2 a even though the phenol group contents and amounts of persulfate consumed significantly correlated markedly more benzene was oxidized in the ga and hq systems than in the control systems in which benzene was oxidized by sulfate radicals produced through thermal dissociation of persulfate fig 2 a the high phenol group contents of the ga and hq systems probably contributed to the production of sulfate radicals that oxidized benzene however no more benzene was oxidized in the presence of the hs and other model compounds than in the controls in particular the amount of benzene that was oxidized in the ta system was not markedly higher than the amount oxidized in the controls even though the ta system contained a similar amount of phenol groups to the ga and hq systems and consumed markedly more persulfate than the controls fig 1 a the systems containing sa tyr and jl model compounds containing phenol groups also did not oxidize markedly more benzene than the controls the amount of benzene that was oxidized did not significantly correlate with the sum of the contents of the three redox active groups phenol quinone and ketone groups fig 2 b like the ga and hq systems the reduced bq system oxidized a large amount of benzene it was clear that the reduction process transformed bq into hq and this explained the relatively high reactivity of the reduced bq system similar amounts of benzene were oxidized in both the pristine and reduced ga ta and hq systems the phenol group content of the jl system was expected to have tripled during the reduction process because the borohydride would have reduced the quinone groups in jl however the amount of benzene that was oxidized in the reduced jl system was not higher than the amount of benzene that was oxidized in the controls the stoichiometries of the benzene oxidation reactions involving the redox active groups were assessed by fitting linear regressions to plots of the data for the systems in which markedly more benzene was oxidized than in the control systems i e the pristine ga and hq systems and the reduced ga bp ap bq and hq systems see fig s2 the stoichiometric ratio for benzene oxidation by a redox active group was 0 47 this indicated that one mole of an electron donating group in the systems mentioned above yielded 0 47 mol of sulfate radicals that could oxidize benzene assuming that negligible side reactions e g sulfate radical reactions with benzene oxidation products occurred liu et al 2016 the discrepancy between this stoichiometric ratio 0 47 and the stoichiometric ratios of 0 86 and 0 95 for persulfate consumption related to the redox active group contents fig 1 indicated that persulfate consumption by the hs and the model compounds did not always create sulfate radicals required to oxidize benzene the compounds bearing phenol groups except ga and hq generally gave much lower stoichiometric ratios for benzene oxidation and phenol group contents than ga and hq this indicated that the sulfate radical scavenging capacities of these compounds were higher than the persulfate activation capacities of the compounds notably the ta and reduced jl systems which had relatively large phenol group contents and therefore consumed large amounts of persulfate did not oxidize large amounts of benzene relative to the controls sulfate radicals are probably more efficiently scavenged by larger molecules such as ta than smaller molecules we therefore predicted that sulfate radicals might be more efficiently scavenged by phenolic moieties in higher molecular weight hs than phenolic moieties in lower molecular weight hs slightly larger amounts of sulfate radicals that could oxidize benzene were produced in the reduced bp and ap systems than in the control system fig 2b this implied that reduced ketones contributed more to activating persulfate than to scavenging sulfate radicals 3 3 stoichiometry of persulfate consumption and benzene oxidation in the presence of hs the amount of benzene that was oxidized per unit of persulfate consumed in the presence of the hs was always lower than in the control system fig 3 this indicated that the hs scavenged more sulfate radicals than were produced through persulfate activation the terrestrially derived aquatic hs including the reduced srha and srfa systems contributed more than the other hs to benzene oxidation and consumed the most persulfate more benzene was also oxidized by the pristine srha and srfa systems than the other hs systems this supported the conclusion that phenol groups in hs play roles in activating persulfate and the subsequent oxidation of benzene because srha and srfa contain more phenol groups than do the other hs table s2 umrn had the lowest phenolic group content and consumed the least persulfate regardless of the redox state of the umrn this indicated that umrn as well as containing few phenol groups contained only small amounts of electron accepting groups that were reduced by the borohydride and could subsequently activate persulfate the benzene to persulfate stoichiometric ratios were lower for the three soil derived hs lha ppha and esha and plfa than for the other hs more sulfate radicals were scavenged by the soil derived hs than the other hs because the soil derived hs were composed of larger molecules that could more efficiently scavenge sulfate radicals than the smaller model compounds preferential reactions between sulfate radicals and high molecular weight hs have been found in previous studies e g cheng et al 2018 tian et al 2018 the low benzene persulfate stoichiometric ratio for the plfa which lacks phenolic moieties could have been caused by the presence of more protein like moieties such as tyr which would have consumed persulfate through electrophilic substitution without producing sulfate radicals behrman and bidinger 1989 this indicated that the types of redox active moieties in hs strongly affect the yields of sulfate radicals that can oxidize benzene after persulfate has been activated by the hs 3 4 spectroscopic characteristics of the hs the suva of ga ta and hq which contain phenol groups were markedly increased by reacting with persulfate figs s3 and s4 this was ascribed to the formation of quinone moieties through oxidation of the phenol groups by persulfate no clear changes in the uv vis absorbances of pa and sa were found to be caused by reacting with persulfate pa does not contain phenol groups that could activate persulfate so the uv vis absorbance of pa did not markedly change through the reaction between pa and persulfate the aromatic carboxyl groups in pa did not appear to be altered by oxidation by persulfate because changes in absorbance were not observed in any part of the spectrum fig s3b sa contains a phenol group that was not involved in persulfate activation as mentioned in section 3 1 and absorbance by sa was not affected by sa reacting with persulfate the absorbance of tyr did not change markedly through the reaction between tyr and persulfate even though tyr contains a phenol moiety this confirmed that the phenol structure in tyr does not participate in the activation of persulfate however absorbance between 200 and 225 nm by trp decreased because of the reaction between trp and persulfate indicating that chromophoric components of trp were altered an increase in absorbance at 250 nm however was probably caused by trp being transformed into aromatic ketone containing substances e g kynurenine through oxidation triquigneaux et al 2012 the suvas of substances containing quinone and aromatic ketone moieties ap bp bq and jl were consistently lower after than before the reduction process figs s3 and s4 this indicated that quinone and aromatic ketone moieties were reduced to their phenolic and secondary alcohol forms respectively reacting with persulfate increased the suva of these reduced model compounds markedly because quinone and aromatic ketone moieties formed the suva of reduced ap bp and bq however did not increase to their original values indicating that the subsequent oxidation of reduced quinone and aromatic ketones by persulfate was not completely reversible fractional suva changes were used to evaluate changes in the redox properties of the hs caused by the treatments fig 4 the suva values for the hs samples were lower after than before reduction with borohydride indicating that the carbonyl groups quinone and ketone in the hs were reduced to phenol groups and secondary alcohol groups the suva values of the terrestrially derived aquatic hs srha and srfa and soil derived hs ppha and esha but not lha were decreased markedly by the reduction process these hs probably have higher electron accepting capacities than the microbially derived hs plfa the fractional suva changes for the lha and the microbially derived hs were similar but the absolute decrease in the suva was higher for the lha than the microbially derived hs this was consistent with the results of a previous study in which higher electron accepting capacities were found for terrestrially derived hs than microbially derived hs aeschbacher et al 2012 the oxidation treatments caused the hs suva to increase because phenols and secondary alcohols in the hs were oxidized to carbonyl groups the srha and srfa systems in which the most benzene was oxidized and persulfate consumed had higher suva increases than did the other systems the absolute suva increases caused by reacting with persulfate were also higher for srha and srfa than for the microbially derived and soil derived hs fig s5 this indicated that phenol groups in srha and srfa reacted with persulfate and were oxidized to quinone groups when the hs reduced using borohydride were oxidized by persulfate the suva values returned to the original suva values for the pristine hs or even became higher than the original suva values except for esha however the suva values were lower for the reduced oxidized samples than the oxidized samples this indicated that oxidation by persulfate did not restore some reduced hs moieties to carbonyl groups for example the ap suva was only partly recovered by oxidizing the reduced system fig s4 this could explain the incomplete recoveries of the suva in the reduced oxidized hs further oxidation of carbonyl groups to carboxylic groups could also explain the suva being lower for the reduced oxidized systems than the oxidized systems the eem fluorescence intensities of all of the hs were higher after than before the reduction process figs s6 s12 and table s3 this was caused by quenching of electron accepting moieties in the hs ma et al 2010 phillips and smith 2014 kim et al 2018b blue shifted emission peaks in the eems of the reduced hs also indicated that the electron accepting moieties in the hs had been reduced yang et al 2016 the fluorescence peak intensities were lower for the oxidized hs than the pristine hs oxidation of the reduced hs increased the eem peak intensities the eem peak intensities changed more in the humic and fulvic like regions figs s5 s11 and table s3 than the other regions this indicated that humic and fulvic like moieties were mainly responsible for reacting with and reducing persulfate 3 5 fri volume changes for the hs the pi n values for region iv humic like and region iii fulvic like were 80 of the total fri volumes for the terrestrially derived aquatic hs and soil derived hs table s4 region i protein like and region ii microbially derived contributed up to 32 5 of the fri volumes for the microbially derived hs the pi n values for region i and region ii increased and the pi n of region iv decreased when the hs except umrn were reduced however oxidation and reduction oxidation did not markedly alter the pi n values for the different region this indicated that no hs moiety preferentially donated electrons to either persulfate or the sulfate radical correlations between changes in the fri volume and persulfate consumption were therefore assessed using the decreases in vt n values caused by reacting with persulfate oxidation or reduction oxidation rather than changes in the pi n values a linear correlation was found between the decrease in fri volume and the amount of persulfate consumed fig 5 this suggested that the decrease in fri volume could be used to evaluate electron transfer from hs to persulfate without measuring the electron donating capacities of the hs which would be relatively complicated chon et al 2015 electron transfers between redox active carbonyl and phenol moieties in hs and persulfate can be predicted from changes in the fri volume 4 conclusions the results indicated that phenol moieties in hs were mainly responsible for the consumption of persulfate and contributed to the production of sulfate radicals for oxidizing pollutants markedly more persulfate was consumed by the hs model compounds containing phenolate moieties than the hs model compounds containing other moieties redox active carbonyl groups such as aromatic ketones and quinone groups were also able to donate electrons to persulfate when those moieties were reduced however different mechanisms were involved in persulfate activation by reduced ketones secondary alcohols and by phenols because direct electron transfer from reduced ketones to persulfate is not likely more persulfate was consumed and more sulfate radicals were produced by terrestrially derived aquatic hs srha and srfa which contain large numbers of phenol groups than by hs from other sources more sulfate radicals were scavenged by soil derived hs which contain larger molecules than other hs than by lower molecular weight hs the decrease in fri volume for the hs linearly correlated with the amount of persulfate consumed so the decrease in fri volume could be used to represent electron transfer from hs to persulfate when electron donating capacity measurements cannot readily be performed persulfate activation by hs was less beneficial than thermal activation in the control system in terms of the stoichiometry of pollutant oxidation and persulfate consumption even though it was found in previous studies that pollutants can be oxidized faster by hs activated persulfate than in systems not containing hs this was because the hs scavenged more sulfate radicals than they produced by activating persulfate however the yield of radicals used for oxidizing contaminants in the reduced srha system was 0 16 mol per mole of persulfate which was higher than for the conventional persulfate fe2 system 0 13 mol of so4 per mole of s2o8 2 kim et al 2018a this indicated that activating persulfate using hs could be stoichiometrically advantageous over activating persulfate using fe2 if an aquifer contains high concentrations of organic pollutants e g petroleum hydrocarbons that have high electron rich hs contents and the conditions are reducing eganhouse et al 1993 we previously found that nanosized zero valent iron nzvi effectively reduced electron accepting moieties in srha kim et al 2018b the hs activated persulfate system could be used downgradient of the nzvi reactive zone hs from upgradient would be expected to be reduced by the nzvi and the reduced hs would effectively activate persulfate and cause untreated organic pollutants to be removed eq 6 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

16257,there are plentiful ways to synthesize sulfidized nanoscale zerovalent iron s nzvi and this study investigated the influence of sulfur reagents na2s na2s2o3 na2s2o4 and sulfidation sequence co sulfidation and post sulfidation method on the physicochemical properties reactivity and long term performance of s nzvi in simulated groundwater the results suggested that the co sulfidized nzvi s nzvico has higher reactivity 2 fold than s nzvipost due to the stronger electron transfer capacity deriving from the higher content of fe0 and reductive sulfur species however during aging the reactivity of s nzvico would be lost more rapidly than s nzvipost due to the faster corrosion of fe0 and more oxidation of reductive sulfur species s nzvipost has the superior long term performance with the degradation rate of trichloroethylene tce remained at 30 60 even after 90 d of aging sulfur precursors can control the selectivity of s nzvi by affecting the sulfur speciation on the particle surface the proportion of reductive sulfur species on s nzvipost synthesized by na2s was higher than s nzvipost synthesized by na2s2o3 or na2s2o4 resulting in a higher selectivity of the former s nzvipost than the latter s nzvipost in addition sulfidation procedures and sulfur precursors did not affect the degradation pathway of tce nevertheless the degradation product distribution can be affected by the different physicochemical transformation of various types of s nzvi with the aging time these results indicated that sulfur reagents and sulfidation procedures have crucial effects on the reactivity and long term performance of s nzvi which can be designed for the specific application scenarios graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aging long term reactivity sulfidation tce groundwater transformation 1 introduction nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi has been widely applied in environmental remediation for numerous hazardous contaminants i e halogenated organics nitroaromatics and heavy metals due to its high reactivity and large specific surface area wang and zhang 1997 chen et al 2016 dong and lo 2013 peng et al 2017 however there are still two main technical obstacles limiting the application of nzvi i the aggregation of nzvi caused by its strong magnetism decreases the reactivity and mobility sun et al 2020 li et al 2020 ii the great reducibility of nzvi makes it prone to react with water and other reducible species e g dissolved oxygen nitrate henderson and demond 2013 cheng et al 2019 the side reactions of nzvi with natural oxidants leads to the non selectivity toward target contaminants resulting the low utilization efficiency and short reactive lifespan to improve the performance of nzvi a great deal of researches has been reported including bimetallic nzvi yan et al 2010 polymer modified nzvi phenrat et al 2018 dong et al 2020a sulfide modified nzvi kim et al 2011 wang et al 2020 etc among the multifarious modification approaches that have been proposed to overcome the aforementioned limitations sulfidation of nzvi is considered to be a promising method which significantly enhances the reactivity and selectivity of nzvi fan et al 2016 chen et al 2020 the underlying mechanism of the improved performance was reported in some studies han and yan 2016 proposed that fes layer poisons hydrogen recombination to provide more atomic hydrogen for the degradation of tce rather than the formation of h2 whereas it is widely reported that the high electron conductivity of fes layer and the great affinity between trichloroethylene tce and the reactive sites of the iron sulfide shell contribute to the enhanced performance of s nzvi fan et al 2017 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 ning et al 2020 in previous studies different kinds of s precursors e g sulfide thiosulfate and dithionite han and yan 2016 fe precursors e g ferrous and ferric xu et al 2020a and sulfidized procedures e g co sulfidation and post sulfidation li et al 2018 xu et al 2019b were used to synthesize s nzvi these different methods might affect the sulfur species fe0 and sulfur content cao et al 2020 which lead to the difference in the reactivity and selectivity of s nzvi however the experiment conditions are quite different in various studies and the consensus cannot be reached by comparison directly several researchers made the effort to figure out the influence of sulfidation procedures and sulfur precursors a previous study compared the performance of s nzvi synthesized by co sulfidation method and post sulfidation method denoted as s nzvico and s nzvipost respectively and reported that the tce degradation rate of s nzvico was 90 times higher than that of s nzvipost bhattacharjee and ghoshal 2018 in contrast another study found that the s nzvipost with higher fe0 and s content possesses higher reactivity xu et al 2020c the effects of sulfur reagents on the s nzvi has been shown that the differences were negligible han and yan 2016 which is inconsistent with a recent investigation xu et al 2020a so far the effect of different sulfidation procedures and sulfur precursors on the properties and reactivity of s nzvi remains largely unclear it is noteworthy that sulfur reagents would undergo discrepant chemical process in the sulfidation processes with different acid base conditions influencing the amount and speciation of sulfur and iron in particles fan et al 2017 in addition in light of the influence of critical factors in groundwater i e typical anions and cations natural organic matter on the physicochemical transformation of nzvi dong et al 2020b the species evolution of various kinds of s nzvi with different structure and surface chemistry may also vary in aqueous environment and these differences are likely to affect the properties of the resulted s nzvi in practical applications although xu et al 2019b assessed the longevity of s nzvico and s nzvipost in deionized water the impact of sulfidation procedures and sulfur precursors on transformation and long term performance of s nzvi in anaerobic groundwater is still not well known in this work we synthesized s nzvi with different sulfur reagents i e na2s nas2o3 and na2s2o4 via co sulfidation method and post sulfidation method denoted as s nzvico 1 s nzvico 2 s nzvico 3 s nzvipost 1 s nzvipost 2 and s nzvipost 3 respectively the physicochemical properties and transformation of nzvi and different types of s nzvi in simulated groundwater were investigated for comparison tce a typical organic contaminant in groundwater was used as a probe to analyze the reactivity of fresh and aged nzvi and s nzvi in anaerobic simulated groundwater the knowledge provided in this study could help to

different sulfidation procedures and sulfur reagents as seen in fig 1 a c s nzvico was mainly composed of spherical cubic and irregular particles besides the surface of spherical particles was rough for the co sulfidation method the difference in morphology caused by sulfur reagents mainly lies in the particle size the particle synthesized by dithionite i e s nzvico 3 was larger than that produced by sulfide and thiosulfate i e s nzvico 1 and s nzvico 2 it seems that since the fecl3 solution used in co sulfidation method is acidic different kinds of sulfur precursors will outgas h2s to some degrees during the synthesis process resulting in the difference of actual incorporated s content as seen in fig s2a c the s content of s nzvico 3 was lower than that of s nzvico 1 and s nzvico 2 thus the discrepancy of particle size may be ascribed to the actual s fe denoted as s fe particle the spherical particles in s nzvipost were coated by film structure fig 1d f but that was not observed in s nzvico the film structure could be assigned to the formed iron sulfide species on the particle surface which is likely to control the affinity to water constituents and tce influencing the reactivity and corrosion rate in addition it can be obviously observed that the coating states of the film structure varied in the different types of s nzvipost which was potentially ascribed to the different corrosivity of sulfur precursors to fe0 or the variation of the formed sulfur species fig s3 and 2 display the xrd patterns of fresh nzvi s nzvico and s nzvipost the fe0 peaks of fe 110 and fe 200 planes were both present in the patterns of s nzvico while only the broad peak of fe0 fe 110 was observed in the patterns of nzvi and s nzvipost note that the intensity of fe0 fe 110 in s nzvipost was similar with that in nzvi which was lower than that in s nzvico consistent with previous study cao et al 2020 the crystallinity of fe can be increased in co sulfidated materials but affected slightly in post sulfidated materials as seen in fig s4 the diffraction peak of fe 110 has a shifting with co sulfidation suggesting the incorporation of sulfur panda et al 2022 roberts et al 2004 besides guo et al 2018 and xu et al 2020b also reported that co sulfidation method incorporated sulfur into the fe0 bcc structure to form an alloy compound instead of a phase segregated structure or a physically mixed structure whereas the post sulfidation process involves the interfacial reaction between sulfur reagents and fe0 which introduced the limited sulfur content on the particles surface and formed the phase segregated structure xu et al 2019a in addition the different sulfur precursors also altered the fe crystallinity of s nzvico but have little effect on that of s nzvipost for s nzvico since the iron sulfide forms in parallel with fe0 the aqueous chemistry of sulfur reagents may have effects on the nucleation process but the interfacial reaction between sulfur reagents and as prepared nzvi has a limited effect on fe crystallinity during post sulfidation thus the crystallinity of fe0 may be affected by sulfidation procedures and the sulfur reagents in co sulfidation method however how sulfur reagents affect the fe crystallinity in co sulfidation process remains to be explored considering that the sulfidation mechanisms may differ in diverse sulfidation conditions leading to the difference in surface chemical composition xps analyses were carried out fig 3 shows the spectrum of s 2p region for fresh s nzvico fig 3a the peaks corresponding to the s2 s2 2 and sn 2 were detected at 161 2 ev 162 5 ev and 163 2 ev respectively guo et al 2010 nunez garcia et al 2016 there were only reduced sulfur species in s nzvico however for s nzvipost fig 3b in addition to the presence of reduced sulfur species the peaks correspond to the oxidized sulfur species so3 2 and so4 2 were detected at 166 7 ev and 168 6 ev respectively baltrusaitis et al 2007 guo et al 2010 nunez garcia et al 2016 the difference in sulfur species could be ascribed to the different reaction conditions of the two kinds of sulfidation methods the reductive condition was maintained throughout the co sulfidation process since sodium borohydride is excessive fig 3a also shows that fes and fes2 were the s species of s nzvico 1 and s nzvico 2 while both fes and fesn exist in s nzvico 3 as seen in fig 3b the intensity of oxidized sulfur species peaks in s nzvipost 3 was higher than that in s nzvipost 1 and s nzvipost 2 these results indicate that sulfidized procedures and sulfur precursors play an important role in controlling the s species in s nzvi due to the different band gaps of reductive sulfur species e g fes 0 10 ev fes2 0 95 ev and fe3s4 0 00 ev xu et al 2020a the different s nzvi particles may exhibit diverse reactivity and selectivity which will be discussed in section 3 3 and 3 4 3 2 sulfidation procedures affect the structural transformation and corrosion rate of fe0 previous study demonstrated that corrosion of fe0 nanoparticles could occur after exposure to aqueous environment resulting in an evolution in morphology structure and surface composition with exposure time dong et al 2020b however the corrosion rate of fe could be influenced by the surface modification therefore to illustrate the effect of sulfidation methods on the corrosion process of s nzvi the morphologic and compositional changes of nzvi and s nzvi particles resulted by continuous exposure of particles to simulated groundwater were investigated by sem tem xrd and xps in the sem images of aged nzvi fig s1b d from day 30 to 60 the hexagonal platelets and irregular flakes increased and became greater in size and spherical particles gradually transformed to flaky shaped and cauliflower like structure indicating formation of green rust and iron oxyhydr oxide dong et al 2020b mangayayam et al 2019 from day 60 to 90 only slight evolution was observed in comparison corrosion of s nzvico particles occurred substantially faster with the spherical particles decreased sharply from day 0 to 30 fig s5 in contrast spherical particles of s nzvipost were still abundant after 90 days of aging fig s6 the structural transformation was also explored by tem as seen in fig 4 the conceptual model with tem images showed the various structural changes of the different s nzvi particles the s nzvipost particles fig 4 d f showed the chain like structure and core shell structure and according to the xrd results discussed above the sulfur only existed on the surface of s nzvipost particles which was consistent with the previous studies mangayayam et al 2019 xu et al 2021 whereas the boundary between the core and shell of s nzvico particles was not obvious and the surface was rough additionally the sulfur was incorporated and evenly distributed in the s nzvico particles xu et al 2021 these results are showing no difference in the conceptual model of fan et al 2017 compared with the sulfidation procedures sulfur reagents play minor roles in the structure fig 4a c indicate that the sulfur reagents mainly alter the particle size of s nzvico after exposure to simulated groundwater the s nzvi particles were corroded and the flaky like and needle like iron oxides were formed interestingly the diffusion directions of corrosion regions were quite different between the s nzvico and s nzvipost for the aged s nzvico fig 4 d f and g i the corrosion regions gradually diffused from the edge of the core toward the center forming the concentric structure and the spherical structure of some particles were destroyed in contrast the corrosion regions of s nzvipost particles diffused outward from the center of the core forming the hollow structure this is similar to the kirkendall effect where the sulfur diffused inward more slowly than iron did outward yin et al 2004 analogous structures were found in the s nzvipost particles with high sulfur content and long sulfidation time xu et al 2019a in light of the difference in the diffusion rates of iron and sulfur xu et al 2019a yin et al 2004 the discrepancy of the sulfur distribution may be responsible for the different corrosion regions fig 5a also shows the change of fe content with aging it indicates that the fe0 of s nzvico would be consumed most rapidly under simulated groundwater which is contrary to previous studies li et al 2016 xu et al 2019b the contradictory findings might result from the different aging conditions it was reported that chloride ions can attack the passive film to form the pits or crevices which avails the corrosion of metallic iron gotpagar et al 1999 moreover it was found that the s nzvico is more susceptible to corrosion than nzvi in the presence of chloride ions kim et al 2013 turcio ortega et al 2012 for s nzvipost the corrosion of fe0 might be impeded by the film structure the xrd patterns also showed the chemical composition evolution of s nzvi fig 2 the type of corrosion products does not change with aging on s nzvico and s nzvipost surface but the sulfidation procedures seem to make a slight difference in the transformation of iron oxides the feooh is formed in s nzvipost after 60 d while that is present in s nzvico after 30 d this would contribute to the higher electron transfer capacity of s nzvipost 30 d to some degree due to the lower band gap of iron oxides e g fe2o3 2 2 ev fe3o4 0 1 ev compared to iron oxyhydroxide feooh 2 6 ev xu et al 2020b in xps patterns fig 3 and fig s7 peaks for reduced sulfur species gradually decreased while peaks for oxidized sulfur species increased especially for s nzvico there was a sharp increase in the intensity of oxidized sulfur species from day 0 to 30 which may stem from the oxidation of reductive sulfur species or the adsorption of so4 2 from the bulk solution mangayayam et al 2019 after aging up to 90 d the reductive sulfur species was absent in s nzvipost 3 however it is noteworthy that the oxidation rate of sulfur species on fresh s nzvipost surface seemed slower because the oxidized sulfur species were present in the first place thus compared with s nzvico the oxidation of reduced sulfur species had smaller effect on the decrease in electron transfer capacity of s nzvipost during aging process besides the sulfur reagents hardly caused any significant difference in the evolution of sulfur species of the aged s nzvi particles 3 3 sulfidation procedures and sulfur precursors affect the reactivity and long term performance of s nzvi the reactivity and long term performance of particles were accessed by the removal and degradation rate of tce it was found that the different sulfidation procedures and sulfur precursors did affect the reactivity and long term performance of s nzvi the surface area normalized first order rate constant k sa of fresh s nzvico or s nzvipost for tce removal can be increased by 1 39 30 56 times than nzvi fig 5 b but it was unexpected that the k sa of s nzvipost 3 was slightly lower than nzvi this result may be contributed to the insufficient sulfur content incorporated into s nzvipost 3 fig s2 and the depletion of fe content during synthesis fig 5a however the promotion caused by sulfur reagents showed opposite trend in different sulfidation procedures for s nzvico the k sa of s nzvi synthesized by na2s2o4 was 8 fold and 3 fold times higher than that synthesized by na2s or na2s2o3 as described in section 3 1 the different sulfur precursors altered the fe crystallinity of s nzvico it was reported that the nzvi with lower fe crystallinity may possess the higher electron donating ability shen et al 2020 however in this study s nzvi synthesized by na2s2o4 with higher fe crystallinity exhibited better reactivity which is contrary to the findings of the literature this may be due to the fact that the electron transfer capacity of s nzvi is affected by the surface sulfur species in addition to the fe crystallinity and the former is more influential because of its outstanding conductivity whereas for s nzvipost the k sa of s nzvi synthesized by na2s was 22 fold and 46 fold times higher than that synthesized by na2s2o3 or na2s2o4 these results can be ascribed to the different composition of s nzvi as discussed in section 3 1 especially for s nzvipost the difference in sulfur content and proportion of oxidized sulfur species may account for the difference of reactivity it was observed that sulfur content could be in the decreasing order of s nzvipost 1 s nzvipost 2 s nzvipost 3 fig s2 and the proportion of oxidized sulfur species could be in the increasing order of s nzvipost 1 s nzvipost 2 s nzvipost 3 table s3 but the oxidized sulfur species do not make a contribution to electron transfer capacity enhancement han and yan 2016 thus the reactivity of s nzvipost 3 was the lowest in addition the k sa of s nzvico was higher than s nzvipost except for the s nzvi using na2s precursor for s nzvico 1 and s nzvipost 1 na2s has slight effect on the sulfur content on the particles surface hence s zvipost 1 may possess more reactive sites on per unit area due to the smaller specific surface area table s1 contributing to the higher k sa the k sa of nzvi decreased slightly after 5 d of aging and then remained constant fig 5b this was initiated by the decreased reactive sites on nzvi which was derived from the passivation of iron oxides fig s3 and the passivation layer retarded the further oxidation of nzvi as for the aged s nzvi particles the k sa decreased sharply from 0 d to 5 d and then decreased gradually and leveled off after 60 d of aging nevertheless during the 30 d of aging the k sa of s nzvico decreased significantly more than s nzvipost this should be related to the remarkable decline in electron transfer capacity and hydrophobicity of s nzvico due to the faster corrosion of fe0 fig 5a and more oxidation of reductive sulfur species fig s7a b however the change of degradation rate showed a completely different trend contrary to the removal rate the degradation rate increased during the 30 d of aging except for s nzvico 1 fig s8 the underlying mechanism of the enhancement in degradation rate with aging is unclear it might be ascribed to the combined effect of fe0 depletion crevices and surface corrosion products formation fe0 is the primary source of reducibility of s nzvi depletion of fe core can lead to the decrease in k sa values but keep the degradation rate mangayayam et al 2019 it was reported that green rust sulfate generated under the coexistence of sulfate ferrous and ferric iron has a high reactivity reduction and adsorption towards a large scope of contaminants including chlorinated organic erbs et al 1999 su et al 2018 moreover fe3o4 is one of the corrosion products its puffy structure provides an access to reactive sites for tce and conserve the reducibility under alkaline condition gu et al 2019 thus the degradation rate did not decrease drastically with aging as expected in addition the enhanced degradation rate of aged s nzvi might be due to the pits or crevices formed in the passive film which promote the contact between tce and reactive sites the decreased adsorption is ascribed to the lower hydrophobicity of corrosion products than that of reductive sulfur species resulting in the lower affinity to tce comparatively the k sa of s nzvipost decreased slightly meanwhile was always higher than that of s nzvico from day 30 to 90 as the surface chemical composition were similar the lower k sa value of s nzvico may be ascribed to the lower electron transfer capacity caused by concentric structure as discussed in section 3 2 as seen in fig s8 after 60 d of aging the degradation rate by s nzvico dropped sharply to almost 0 while that by s nzvipost was constant note that the tce degradation by s nzvipost 1 was abnormally higher than the removal rate which may be caused by the discrepancy between tce and the product analysis methods this indicates that after 60 d of aging the removal of tce by s nzvico basically depended on adsorption while reductive degradation still played a dominant role in s nzvipost as stated in section 3 2 s nzvico was inclined to react with some chemical components of groundwater accelerating the depletion of fe0 nevertheless the relatively denser film on the surface of s nzvipost prevented fe core from being corroded rapidly therefore the difference of structural transformation and fe content may be the key factors for the discrepancy of aged 60 d 90 d s nzvi for tce removal however xu et al 2019b reported that the reactive lifetime of s nzvico using the na2s2o4 precursor was about 2 times higher than s nzvipost using the na2s precursor in which the longevity of particles was assessed by the h2 evolution kinetics in water it s worth noting that the h2 evolution rate is related to the physicochemical and surface chemistry of particles during the aging process in groundwater anions cations and natural organic matter will affect the dissolution rate of fe0 and fes layer han et al 2019 species of the formed corrosion products mangayayam et al 2020 and the colloidal stability dong and lo 2013 hence these would further influence the reactivity and lifetime of aged s nzvi in addition s nzvi using different sulfur precursors showed discrepancy on reactivity and long term performance fig 5b s8 this may be because the sulfur precursors involved different chemical processes in different sulfidation procedures resulting in differences in the initial composition and their evolution for sulfide there are two main pathways to form fes 1 hs can form fes by replacing the adsorbed oh or corroding the iron oxides on fe0 eqs 2 5 hansson et al 2006 2 dissolved fe2 produced by the localized corrosion of fe0 reacts with hs directly eqs 6 9 cai et al 2021 previous studies have shown that the fes generated by these two ways have different morphologies and protective properties fan et al 2017 resulting in the discrepancy in the long term performance similarly thiosulfate is prone to chemical decomposition in aqueous solution thiosulfate decomposes into elemental sulfur bisulfate and sulfur dioxide under acidic conditions eqs 10 11 whereas it is disproportionated to sulfate and sulfide under alkaline conditions eq 12 choudhary et al 2015 as for dithionite the disproportionation gives rise to the formation of thiosulfate and sulfite at low ph eq 13 while sulfite and sulfide at high ph eq 14 fan et al 2017 therefore the subsequent sulfidation mechanisms are different which might further influence the formation and evolution of sulfur species 2 fe oh ads hs fe hsads oh 3

aged materials through the qualitative and quantitative analysis of chlorinated intermediates and non chlorinate products the effect of sulfidation sequence and sulfur precursors on the degradation pathway was speculated as illustrated in fig 6 the degradation product of tce by fresh particles was mainly ethylene for nzvi acetylene was also produced in the systems of s nzvico or s nzvipost however relatively low concentration of ethane was generated in addition to ethylene and acetylene accompanied by the presence of chlorinated intermediates i e dichloroethylene and vinyl chloride these indicate that Œ≤ elimination is the degradation pathway in nzvi system and sulfidation sequences and sulfur precursors did not change the degradation pathway of tce by s nzvi but ethylene and acetylene in the system of s nzvico were higher than that in s nzvipost han and yan 2016 found that s fe particle is a critical factor of the acetylene accumulation the higher sulfur dose causes the higher accumulation of acetylene it is consistent with the previous discussion that co sulfidation incorporated higher sulfur content into particles after a determined period of aging the degradation rate and product of tce by nzvi had no obvious change whereas the distribution of non chlorinate products changed in the s nzvi system in the system of s nzvico the primary product of the materials aged for 5 d was still ethylene but in s nzvico 2 system the concentration of ethane increased significantly while the concentration of ethylene and acetylene changed slightly it reveals that the reducibility of s nzvico 2 was improved and the hydrogenation reaction was promoted after 5 d of aging in contrast the concentrations of products by 5 day aged s nzvico 1 and s nzvico 3 remained almost constant it is known the low h atom density caused by s is not conducive to hydrogenolysis and the transformation from acetylene to ethylene and ethane is likely to occur in the high h atom density region phenrat and lowry 2019 thus the discrepancy in product distribution among these materials might be ascribed to the pits or crevices formed on the passive film of s nzvico 2 however it is generally believed that fe0 sites should be oxidized rapidly by water to form passive layer eq 6 mangayayam et al 2020 found that the corresponding anodic eq 15 and cathodic reactions eq 16 occur on locally separated sites hence these cracks allow more fe0 sites to be exposed for the hydrogenation reaction after 30 d of aging the total degradation rate changed slightly but the concentration of acetylene in the systems of s nzvico decreased and the main degradation product changed from ethylene to ethane this can be attributed to the oxidation of reductive sulfur species and formation of cracks on the passivation film as mentioned above nevertheless s nzvico almost lost the reactivity to degrade tce after 60 90 d of aging due to the massive depletion of fe0 and the formation of thick iron oxides shell 15 fe0 fe2 2e anodic sites 16 2e 2h2o h2 2oh cathodic sites compared with the systems of s nzvico ethylene was also the main degradation product by s nzvipost aged for 5 d but the accumulation of acetylene was lower in accordance with the effect of sulfur dose on the accumulation of acetylene as noted above the limited sulfur content introduced into s nzvipost could be the reason for low concentration of acetylene and due to the limited fe0 depletion and the formation of cracks non chlorinate products increased however after 30 d of aging except for ethane as the main degradation product of s nzvipost 3 the main degradation product of s nzvipost 1 and s nzvipost 2 was still ethylene this discrepancy should be caused by the lower content of reductive sulfur species and or more exposed fe0 sites in s nzvipost 3 reducing the Œ≤ elimination reaction rate which is consistent with the previous discussion in contrast to the s nzvico s nzvipost still showed a certain reactivity to degrade tce and the main degradation product was ethane after aging for 90 d the depletion of fe0 resulted in the decline of degradation but s nzvipost still kept a certain amount of reducibility it is noteworthy that through the qualitative analysis of chlorinated intermediates sulfidation procedures and sulfur precursors did not affect the degradation pathway of tce nevertheless the product distribution can be affected by the evolution of different types of s nzvi with the aging time to evaluate the selectivity of these particles the electron efficiency Œµe was calculated fig s9 for fresh particles the selectivity of all s nzvi particles was approximately 44 125 times higher than nzvi in addition the selectivity continued to increase during 30 d of aging however from day 30 to 90 selectivity of s nzvico decreased sharply while that of s nzvipost remained constant moreover the effect of sulfur precursors on selectivity is also different in the two kinds of sulfidation procedures for s nzvipost the selectivity of fresh and aged particles is in decreasing order of s nzvipost 1 s nzvipost 2 s nzvipost 3 which is consistent with the proportion of reductive sulfur species on the surface table s3 the similar correlation was shown between the selectivity of aged s nzvico and the proportion of reductive sulfur species whereas the selectivity of fresh s nzvico is in increasing order of s nzvico 1 s nzvico 3 s nzvico 2 as shown in fig 3a s nzvico 2 has the highest proportion of fes2 while s nzvico 3 has the highest proportion of fes and fesn it was reported that fes2 is more hydrophobic than fes gu et al 2019 xu et al 2020b while fes and fe3s4 have higher electron conductivity xu et al 2020a therefore it indicates that the selectivity of s nzvi depends on the combination of electron transfer capacity and hydrophobicity 4 conclusion the results of this work reveal that different sulfidation procedures and sulfur precursors control the morphology structure fe crystallinity the content and speciation of sulfur and the evolution of iron sulfides and iron oxides these physicochemical properties are critical factors affecting the reactivity of the fresh and aged s nzvi concretely speaking co sulfidation method can generate the s nzvico with higher crystallinity of fe0 and more sulfur content and inhibit the oxidation of iron sulfides in the synthesis process the reactivity of s nzvico to tce was higher than that of s nzvipost however in comparison the long term performance of s nzvipost was superior the sulfur reagents exhibit obvious differences in s nzvico which were mainly reflected in the size and crystallinity of fe0 as for s nzvipost sulfur reagents made a difference in the sulfur content on the surface thus sulfur precursors may play important and multiple roles in the properties of s nzvi during different synthesis conditions which can be chosen to optimize the performance of s nzvi according to the actual needs but further research is indispensable to give insight into the sulfidation mechanisms of different sulfur reagents to make out the key factors influencing the fe crystallinity moreover in this study the effect of sulfidation procedures on the long term performance in simulated groundwater is opposite to a previous research in deionized water xu et al 2019b it indicates that the influence of groundwater composition should be taken into account when it comes to evaluating the long term performance of s nzvi supporting information additional figures fig s1 s13 and tables table s1 s3 can be

16257,there are plentiful ways to synthesize sulfidized nanoscale zerovalent iron s nzvi and this study investigated the influence of sulfur reagents na2s na2s2o3 na2s2o4 and sulfidation sequence co sulfidation and post sulfidation method on the physicochemical properties reactivity and long term performance of s nzvi in simulated groundwater the results suggested that the co sulfidized nzvi s nzvico has higher reactivity 2 fold than s nzvipost due to the stronger electron transfer capacity deriving from the higher content of fe0 and reductive sulfur species however during aging the reactivity of s nzvico would be lost more rapidly than s nzvipost due to the faster corrosion of fe0 and more oxidation of reductive sulfur species s nzvipost has the superior long term performance with the degradation rate of trichloroethylene tce remained at 30 60 even after 90 d of aging sulfur precursors can control the selectivity of s nzvi by affecting the sulfur speciation on the particle surface the proportion of reductive sulfur species on s nzvipost synthesized by na2s was higher than s nzvipost synthesized by na2s2o3 or na2s2o4 resulting in a higher selectivity of the former s nzvipost than the latter s nzvipost in addition sulfidation procedures and sulfur precursors did not affect the degradation pathway of tce nevertheless the degradation product distribution can be affected by the different physicochemical transformation of various types of s nzvi with the aging time these results indicated that sulfur reagents and sulfidation procedures have crucial effects on the reactivity and long term performance of s nzvi which can be designed for the specific application scenarios graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aging long term reactivity sulfidation tce groundwater transformation 1 introduction nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi has been widely applied in environmental remediation for numerous hazardous contaminants i e halogenated organics nitroaromatics and heavy metals due to its high reactivity and large specific surface area wang and zhang 1997 chen et al 2016 dong and lo 2013 peng et al 2017 however there are still two main technical obstacles limiting the application of nzvi i the aggregation of nzvi caused by its strong magnetism decreases the reactivity and mobility sun et al 2020 li et al 2020 ii the great reducibility of nzvi makes it prone to react with water and other reducible species e g dissolved oxygen nitrate henderson and demond 2013 cheng et al 2019 the side reactions of nzvi with natural oxidants leads to the non selectivity toward target contaminants resulting the low utilization efficiency and short reactive lifespan to improve the performance of nzvi a great deal of researches has been reported including bimetallic nzvi yan et al 2010 polymer modified nzvi phenrat et al 2018 dong et al 2020a sulfide modified nzvi kim et al 2011 wang et al 2020 etc among the multifarious modification approaches that have been proposed to overcome the aforementioned limitations sulfidation of nzvi is considered to be a promising method which significantly enhances the reactivity and selectivity of nzvi fan et al 2016 chen et al 2020 the underlying mechanism of the improved performance was reported in some studies han and yan 2016 proposed that fes layer poisons hydrogen recombination to provide more atomic hydrogen for the degradation of tce rather than the formation of h2 whereas it is widely reported that the high electron conductivity of fes layer and the great affinity between trichloroethylene tce and the reactive sites of the iron sulfide shell contribute to the enhanced performance of s nzvi fan et al 2017 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 ning et al 2020 in previous studies different kinds of s precursors e g sulfide thiosulfate and dithionite han and yan 2016 fe precursors e g ferrous and ferric xu et al 2020a and sulfidized procedures e g co sulfidation and post sulfidation li et al 2018 xu et al 2019b were used to synthesize s nzvi these different methods might affect the sulfur species fe0 and sulfur content cao et al 2020 which lead to the difference in the reactivity and selectivity of s nzvi however the experiment conditions are quite different in various studies and the consensus cannot be reached by comparison directly several researchers made the effort to figure out the influence of sulfidation procedures and sulfur precursors a previous study compared the performance of s nzvi synthesized by co sulfidation method and post sulfidation method denoted as s nzvico and s nzvipost respectively and reported that the tce degradation rate of s nzvico was 90 times higher than that of s nzvipost bhattacharjee and ghoshal 2018 in contrast another study found that the s nzvipost with higher fe0 and s content possesses higher reactivity xu et al 2020c the effects of sulfur reagents on the s nzvi has been shown that the differences were negligible han and yan 2016 which is inconsistent with a recent investigation xu et al 2020a so far the effect of different sulfidation procedures and sulfur precursors on the properties and reactivity of s nzvi remains largely unclear it is noteworthy that sulfur reagents would undergo discrepant chemical process in the sulfidation processes with different acid base conditions influencing the amount and speciation of sulfur and iron in particles fan et al 2017 in addition in light of the influence of critical factors in groundwater i e typical anions and cations natural organic matter on the physicochemical transformation of nzvi dong et al 2020b the species evolution of various kinds of s nzvi with different structure and surface chemistry may also vary in aqueous environment and these differences are likely to affect the properties of the resulted s nzvi in practical applications although xu et al 2019b assessed the longevity of s nzvico and s nzvipost in deionized water the impact of sulfidation procedures and sulfur precursors on transformation and long term performance of s nzvi in anaerobic groundwater is still not well known in this work we synthesized s nzvi with different sulfur reagents i e na2s nas2o3 and na2s2o4 via co sulfidation method and post sulfidation method denoted as s nzvico 1 s nzvico 2 s nzvico 3 s nzvipost 1 s nzvipost 2 and s nzvipost 3 respectively the physicochemical properties and transformation of nzvi and different types of s nzvi in simulated groundwater were investigated for comparison tce a typical organic contaminant in groundwater was used as a probe to analyze the reactivity of fresh and aged nzvi and s nzvi in anaerobic simulated groundwater the knowledge provided in this study could help to

via the borohydride reduction method liu et al 2005 the s nzvico and s nzvipost were synthesized using the method proposed by previous studies kim et al 2011 xu et al 2019b dong et al 2019 respectively briefly the mixed solution of different sulfur precursors and nabh4 0 2 m was added dropwise into fecl3 0 05 m solution while stirring up under nitrogen purging for fabricating s nzvico s fe 0 033 the s nzvipost s fe 0 033 was prepared by dropwise addition of different sulfur precursors solutions into as prepared nzvi suspension 2 79 g l under nitrogen puring with stirring continuously after the addition of mixed solution of sulfur precursors and nabh4 or sulfur precursors solutions it was stirred for 30 min for the thorough reaction the resulting nanoparticles were washed with ethanol three times and separated by magnet then the nzvi or s nzvi particles were dried in a vacuum drying oven at 60 c for 12 h the dry particles were stored in sealing films at 4 c 2 3 batch experiments all the batch experiments were conducted in anaerobic simulated groundwater in order to assess the variation of physicochemical properties of nzvi and s nzvi with time the fresh nanoparticles were aged in anaerobic simulated groundwater with the mass loading of 3 g l the suspensions were kept in the dark cabinet and shaken by hand once a day at the specified time points 5 30 60 90 d the aged nanoparticles were separated and rinsed by ethanol after dried in a vacuum drying oven these particles were kept at 4 c prior to usage in characterization and batch experiments the experiments of tce degradation were conducted in 40 ml glass vials after n2 purging for 30 min the simulated groundwater was mixed with a prescribed volume of 10 g l tce stock solution dissolved in methanol to yield the 20 mg l tce at the initial stage then 60 mg nzvi or s nzvi was added into the vials to trigger the reaction the vials were placed on a constant temperature oscillator at 250 rmp at 20 2 c after a determined time of reaction the suspension was taken out and filtered through the 0 45 Œºm syringe filter subsequently the filtrate was shaken with hexane for several minutes and the supernatant was collected for analyses moreover the gas samples were withdrawn and injected into a gas chromatograph flame ionization detector gc fid agilent 7890 b to analyze the products of tce and the gc tcd system gc112a was used to measure the h2 evolution all the experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate 2 4 analytical methods the physicochemical properties of fresh and aged nanoparticles were characterized scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive spectroscopy eds were used to explore the morphology and surface chemical composition of fresh and aged nanoparticles the structure of fresh and aged particles was explored by transmission electron microscopy tem the x ray diffraction xrd analysis was conducted to confirm the crystal phases of the nanoparticles synthesized with different synthesis conditions the fe s and o species of nanoparticles were investigated by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps the tce residual concentration was detected by a gc fid equipped with a db 624 capillary column 30 m 0 53 mm the headspace gas was analyzed by a gc fid agilent 7890 b equipped with a gs gaspro capillary column 30 m 0 32 mm and the concentrations of these gas in aqueous were calculated by using their corresponding henry s law coefficients 3 70 10 2 4 24 10 3 and 1 67 10 3 mole l 1 atm 1 for acetylene ethylene and ethane respectively xu et al 2019b to quantitatively analyze the main degradation products of tce a pseudo first order kinetic model was used to calculate the tce removal rate constants k obs to better compare the selectivity of s nzvi the electron efficiency …õe of nanoparticles was assessed via the following equation eq 1 guan et al 2020 he et al 2020 1 Œµ e n i p i n i p i 2 m where the ni means the molars of electron required for one molar tce transformed to the product 6 for ethylene 4 for acetylene 8 for ethane xu et al 2019b pi is the molars of corresponding product and m is the molars of h2 evolution in the reactive system 3 results and discussions 3 1 sulfidized procedures and sulfur precursors affect the morphology fe crystallinity and s speciation in order to compare the morphology and surface chemistry of different nanoparticles sem eds xrd and xps were carried out for characterization the morphology of fresh nzvi is consistent with previous studies cao et al 2020 wang et al 2015 xu et al 2019b it shows the typical chain like structure composed of aggregated spherical particles fig s1a with the introduction of sulfur the morphology of s nzvi changed more or less with different sulfidation procedures and sulfur reagents as seen in fig 1 a c s nzvico was mainly composed of spherical cubic and irregular particles besides the surface of spherical particles was rough for the co sulfidation method the difference in morphology caused by sulfur reagents mainly lies in the particle size the particle synthesized by dithionite i e s nzvico 3 was larger than that produced by sulfide and thiosulfate i e s nzvico 1 and s nzvico 2 it seems that since the fecl3 solution used in co sulfidation method is acidic different kinds of sulfur precursors will outgas h2s to some degrees during the synthesis process resulting in the difference of actual incorporated s content as seen in fig s2a c the s content of s nzvico 3 was lower than that of s nzvico 1 and s nzvico 2 thus the discrepancy of particle size may be ascribed to the actual s fe denoted as s fe particle the spherical particles in s nzvipost were coated by film structure fig 1d f but that was not observed in s nzvico the film structure could be assigned to the formed iron sulfide species on the particle surface which is likely to control the affinity to water constituents and tce influencing the reactivity and corrosion rate in addition it can be obviously observed that the coating states of the film structure varied in the different types of s nzvipost which was potentially ascribed to the different corrosivity of sulfur precursors to fe0 or the variation of the formed sulfur species fig s3 and 2 display the xrd patterns of fresh nzvi s nzvico and s nzvipost the fe0 peaks of fe 110 and fe 200 planes were both present in the patterns of s nzvico while only the broad peak of fe0 fe 110 was observed in the patterns of nzvi and s nzvipost note that the intensity of fe0 fe 110 in s nzvipost was similar with that in nzvi which was lower than that in s nzvico consistent with previous study cao et al 2020 the crystallinity of fe can be increased in co sulfidated materials but affected slightly in post sulfidated materials as seen in fig s4 the diffraction peak of fe 110 has a shifting with co sulfidation suggesting the incorporation of sulfur panda et al 2022 roberts et al 2004 besides guo et al 2018 and xu et al 2020b also reported that co sulfidation method incorporated sulfur into the fe0 bcc structure to form an alloy compound instead of a phase segregated structure or a physically mixed structure whereas the post sulfidation process involves the interfacial reaction between sulfur reagents and fe0 which introduced the limited sulfur content on the particles surface and formed the phase segregated structure xu et al 2019a in addition the different sulfur precursors also altered the fe crystallinity of s nzvico but have little effect on that of s nzvipost for s nzvico since the iron sulfide forms in parallel with fe0 the aqueous chemistry of sulfur reagents may have effects on the nucleation process but the interfacial reaction between sulfur reagents and as prepared nzvi has a limited effect on fe crystallinity during post sulfidation thus the crystallinity of fe0 may be affected by sulfidation procedures and the sulfur reagents in co sulfidation method however how sulfur reagents affect the fe crystallinity in co sulfidation process remains to be explored considering that the sulfidation mechanisms may differ in diverse sulfidation conditions leading to the difference in surface chemical composition xps analyses were carried out fig 3 shows the spectrum of s 2p region for fresh s nzvico fig 3a the peaks corresponding to the s2 s2 2 and sn 2 were detected at 161 2 ev 162 5 ev and 163 2 ev respectively guo et al 2010 nunez garcia et al 2016 there were only reduced sulfur species in s nzvico however for s nzvipost fig 3b in addition to the presence of reduced sulfur species the peaks correspond to the oxidized sulfur species so3 2 and so4 2 were detected at 166 7 ev and 168 6 ev respectively baltrusaitis et al 2007 guo et al 2010 nunez garcia et al 2016 the difference in sulfur species could be ascribed to the different reaction conditions of the two kinds of sulfidation methods the reductive condition was maintained throughout the co sulfidation process since sodium borohydride is excessive fig 3a also shows that fes and fes2 were the s species of s nzvico 1 and s nzvico 2 while both fes and fesn exist in s nzvico 3 as seen in fig 3b the intensity of oxidized sulfur species peaks in s nzvipost 3 was higher than that in s nzvipost 1 and s nzvipost 2 these results indicate that sulfidized procedures and sulfur precursors play an important role in controlling the s species in s nzvi due to the different band gaps of reductive sulfur species e g fes 0 10 ev fes2 0 95 ev and fe3s4 0 00 ev xu et al 2020a the different s nzvi particles may exhibit diverse reactivity and selectivity which will be discussed in section 3 3 and 3 4 3 2 sulfidation procedures affect the structural transformation and corrosion rate of fe0 previous study demonstrated that corrosion of fe0 nanoparticles could occur after exposure to aqueous environment resulting in an evolution in morphology structure and surface composition with exposure time dong et al 2020b however the corrosion rate of fe could be influenced by the surface modification therefore to illustrate the effect of sulfidation methods on the corrosion process of s nzvi the morphologic and compositional changes of nzvi and s nzvi particles resulted by continuous exposure of particles to simulated groundwater were investigated by sem tem xrd and xps in the sem images of aged nzvi fig s1b d from day 30 to 60 the hexagonal platelets and irregular flakes increased and became greater in size and spherical particles gradually transformed to flaky shaped and cauliflower like structure indicating formation of green rust and iron oxyhydr oxide dong et al 2020b mangayayam et al 2019 from day 60 to 90 only slight evolution was observed in comparison corrosion of s nzvico particles occurred substantially faster with the spherical particles decreased sharply from day 0 to 30 fig s5 in contrast spherical particles of s nzvipost were still abundant after 90 days of aging fig s6 the structural transformation was also explored by tem as seen in fig 4 the conceptual model with tem images showed the various structural changes of the different s nzvi particles the s nzvipost particles fig 4 d f showed the chain like structure and core shell structure and according to the xrd results discussed above the sulfur only existed on the surface of s nzvipost particles which was consistent with the previous studies mangayayam et al 2019 xu et al 2021 whereas the boundary between the core and shell of s nzvico particles was not obvious and the surface was rough additionally the sulfur was incorporated and evenly distributed in the s nzvico particles xu et al 2021 these results are showing no difference in the conceptual model of fan et al 2017 compared with the sulfidation procedures sulfur reagents play minor roles in the structure fig 4a c indicate that the sulfur reagents mainly alter the particle size of s nzvico after exposure to simulated groundwater the s nzvi particles were corroded and the flaky like and needle like iron oxides were formed interestingly the diffusion directions of corrosion regions were quite different between the s nzvico and s nzvipost for the aged s nzvico fig 4 d f and g i the corrosion regions gradually diffused from the edge of the core toward the center forming the concentric structure and the spherical structure of some particles were destroyed in contrast the corrosion regions of s nzvipost particles diffused outward from the center of the core forming the hollow structure this is similar to the kirkendall effect where the sulfur diffused inward more slowly than iron did outward yin et al 2004 analogous structures were found in the s nzvipost particles with high sulfur content and long sulfidation time xu et al 2019a in light of the difference in the diffusion rates of iron and sulfur xu et al 2019a yin et al 2004 the discrepancy of the sulfur distribution may be responsible for the different corrosion regions fig 5a also shows the change of fe content with aging it indicates that the fe0 of s nzvico would be consumed most rapidly under simulated groundwater which is contrary to previous studies li et al 2016 xu et al 2019b the contradictory findings might result from the different aging conditions it was reported that chloride ions can attack the passive film to form the pits or crevices which avails the corrosion of metallic iron gotpagar et al 1999 moreover it was found that the s nzvico is more susceptible to corrosion than nzvi in the presence of chloride ions kim et al 2013 turcio ortega et al 2012 for s nzvipost the corrosion of fe0 might be impeded by the film structure the xrd patterns also showed the chemical composition evolution of s nzvi fig 2 the type of corrosion products does not change with aging on s nzvico and s nzvipost surface but the sulfidation procedures seem to make a slight difference in the transformation of iron oxides the feooh is formed in s nzvipost after 60 d while that is present in s nzvico after 30 d this would contribute to the higher electron transfer capacity of s nzvipost 30 d to some degree due to the lower band gap of iron oxides e g fe2o3 2 2 ev fe3o4 0 1 ev compared to iron oxyhydroxide feooh 2 6 ev xu et al 2020b in xps patterns fig 3 and fig s7 peaks for reduced sulfur species gradually decreased while peaks for oxidized sulfur species increased especially for s nzvico there was a sharp increase in the intensity of oxidized sulfur species from day 0 to 30 which may stem from the oxidation of reductive sulfur species or the adsorption of so4 2 from the bulk solution mangayayam et al 2019 after aging up to 90 d the reductive sulfur species was absent in s nzvipost 3 however it is noteworthy that the oxidation rate of sulfur species on fresh s nzvipost surface seemed slower because the oxidized sulfur species were present in the first place thus compared with s nzvico the oxidation of reduced sulfur species had smaller effect on the decrease in electron transfer capacity of s nzvipost during aging process besides the sulfur reagents hardly caused any significant difference in the evolution of sulfur species of the aged s nzvi particles 3 3 sulfidation procedures and sulfur precursors affect the reactivity and long term performance of s nzvi the reactivity and long term performance of particles were accessed by the removal and degradation rate of tce it was found that the different sulfidation procedures and sulfur precursors did affect the reactivity and long term performance of s nzvi the surface area normalized first order rate constant k sa of fresh s nzvico or s nzvipost for tce removal can be increased by 1 39 30 56 times than nzvi fig 5 b but it was unexpected that the k sa of s nzvipost 3 was slightly lower than nzvi this result may be contributed to the insufficient sulfur content incorporated into s nzvipost 3 fig s2 and the depletion of fe content during synthesis fig 5a however the promotion caused by sulfur reagents showed opposite trend in different sulfidation procedures for s nzvico the k sa of s nzvi synthesized by na2s2o4 was 8 fold and 3 fold times higher than that synthesized by na2s or na2s2o3 as described in section 3 1 the different sulfur precursors altered the fe crystallinity of s nzvico it was reported that the nzvi with lower fe crystallinity may possess the higher electron donating ability shen et al 2020 however in this study s nzvi synthesized by na2s2o4 with higher fe crystallinity exhibited better reactivity which is contrary to the findings of the literature this may be due to the fact that the electron transfer capacity of s nzvi is affected by the surface sulfur species in addition to the fe crystallinity and the former is more influential because of its outstanding conductivity whereas for s nzvipost the k sa of s nzvi synthesized by na2s was 22 fold and 46 fold times higher than that synthesized by na2s2o3 or na2s2o4 these results can be ascribed to the different composition of s nzvi as discussed in section 3 1 especially for s nzvipost the difference in sulfur content and proportion of oxidized sulfur species may account for the difference of reactivity it was observed that sulfur content could be in the decreasing order of s nzvipost 1 s nzvipost 2 s nzvipost 3 fig s2 and the proportion of oxidized sulfur species could be in the increasing order of s nzvipost 1 s nzvipost 2 s nzvipost 3 table s3 but the oxidized sulfur species do not make a contribution to electron transfer capacity enhancement han and yan 2016 thus the reactivity of s nzvipost 3 was the lowest in addition the k sa of s nzvico was higher than s nzvipost except for the s nzvi using na2s precursor for s nzvico 1 and s nzvipost 1 na2s has slight effect on the sulfur content on the particles surface hence s zvipost 1 may possess more reactive sites on per unit area due to the smaller specific surface area table s1 contributing to the higher k sa the k sa of nzvi decreased slightly after 5 d of aging and then remained constant fig 5b this was initiated by the decreased reactive sites on nzvi which was derived from the passivation of iron oxides fig s3 and the passivation layer retarded the further oxidation of nzvi as for the aged s nzvi particles the k sa decreased sharply from 0 d to 5 d and then decreased gradually and leveled off after 60 d of aging nevertheless during the 30 d of aging the k sa of s nzvico decreased significantly more than s nzvipost this should be related to the remarkable decline in electron transfer capacity and hydrophobicity of s nzvico due to the faster corrosion of fe0 fig 5a and more oxidation of reductive sulfur species fig s7a b however the change of degradation rate showed a completely different trend contrary to the removal rate the degradation rate increased during the 30 d of aging except for s nzvico 1 fig s8 the underlying mechanism of the enhancement in degradation rate with aging is unclear it might be ascribed to the combined effect of fe0 depletion crevices and surface corrosion products formation fe0 is the primary source of reducibility of s nzvi depletion of fe core can lead to the decrease in k sa values but keep the degradation rate mangayayam et al 2019 it was reported that green rust sulfate generated under the coexistence of sulfate ferrous and ferric iron has a high reactivity reduction and adsorption towards a large scope of contaminants including chlorinated organic erbs et al 1999 su et al 2018 moreover fe3o4 is one of the corrosion products its puffy structure provides an access to reactive sites for tce and conserve the reducibility under alkaline condition gu et al 2019 thus the degradation rate did not decrease drastically with aging as expected in addition the enhanced degradation rate of aged s nzvi might be due to the pits or crevices formed in the passive film which promote the contact between tce and reactive sites the decreased adsorption is ascribed to the lower hydrophobicity of corrosion products than that of reductive sulfur species resulting in the lower affinity to tce comparatively the k sa of s nzvipost decreased slightly meanwhile was always higher than that of s nzvico from day 30 to 90 as the surface chemical composition were similar the lower k sa value of s nzvico may be ascribed to the lower electron transfer capacity caused by concentric structure as discussed in section 3 2 as seen in fig s8 after 60 d of aging the degradation rate by s nzvico dropped sharply to almost 0 while that by s nzvipost was constant note that the tce degradation by s nzvipost 1 was abnormally higher than the removal rate which may be caused by the discrepancy between tce and the product analysis methods this indicates that after 60 d of aging the removal of tce by s nzvico basically depended on adsorption while reductive degradation still played a dominant role in s nzvipost as stated in section 3 2 s nzvico was inclined to react with some chemical components of groundwater accelerating the depletion of fe0 nevertheless the relatively denser film on the surface of s nzvipost prevented fe core from being corroded rapidly therefore the difference of structural transformation and fe content may be the key factors for the discrepancy of aged 60 d 90 d s nzvi for tce removal however xu et al 2019b reported that the reactive lifetime of s nzvico using the na2s2o4 precursor was about 2 times higher than s nzvipost using the na2s precursor in which the longevity of particles was assessed by the h2 evolution kinetics in water it s worth noting that the h2 evolution rate is related to the physicochemical and surface chemistry of particles during the aging process in groundwater anions cations and natural organic matter will affect the dissolution rate of fe0 and fes layer han et al 2019 species of the formed corrosion products mangayayam et al 2020 and the colloidal stability dong and lo 2013 hence these would further influence the reactivity and lifetime of aged s nzvi in addition s nzvi using different sulfur precursors showed discrepancy on reactivity and long term performance fig 5b s8 this may be because the sulfur precursors involved different chemical processes in different sulfidation procedures resulting in differences in the initial composition and their evolution for sulfide there are two main pathways to form fes 1 hs can form fes by replacing the adsorbed oh or corroding the iron oxides on fe0 eqs 2 5 hansson et al 2006 2 dissolved fe2 produced by the localized corrosion of fe0 reacts with hs directly eqs 6 9 cai et al 2021 previous studies have shown that the fes generated by these two ways have different morphologies and protective properties fan et al 2017 resulting in the discrepancy in the long term performance similarly thiosulfate is prone to chemical decomposition in aqueous solution thiosulfate decomposes into elemental sulfur bisulfate and sulfur dioxide under acidic conditions eqs 10 11 whereas it is disproportionated to sulfate and sulfide under alkaline conditions eq 12 choudhary et al 2015 as for dithionite the disproportionation gives rise to the formation of thiosulfate and sulfite at low ph eq 13 while sulfite and sulfide at high ph eq 14 fan et al 2017 therefore the subsequent sulfidation mechanisms are different which might further influence the formation and evolution of sulfur species 2 fe oh ads hs fe hsads oh 3

aged materials through the qualitative and quantitative analysis of chlorinated intermediates and non chlorinate products the effect of sulfidation sequence and sulfur precursors on the degradation pathway was speculated as illustrated in fig 6 the degradation product of tce by fresh particles was mainly ethylene for nzvi acetylene was also produced in the systems of s nzvico or s nzvipost however relatively low concentration of ethane was generated in addition to ethylene and acetylene accompanied by the presence of chlorinated intermediates i e dichloroethylene and vinyl chloride these indicate that Œ≤ elimination is the degradation pathway in nzvi system and sulfidation sequences and sulfur precursors did not change the degradation pathway of tce by s nzvi but ethylene and acetylene in the system of s nzvico were higher than that in s nzvipost han and yan 2016 found that s fe particle is a critical factor of the acetylene accumulation the higher sulfur dose causes the higher accumulation of acetylene it is consistent with the previous discussion that co sulfidation incorporated higher sulfur content into particles after a determined period of aging the degradation rate and product of tce by nzvi had no obvious change whereas the distribution of non chlorinate products changed in the s nzvi system in the system of s nzvico the primary product of the materials aged for 5 d was still ethylene but in s nzvico 2 system the concentration of ethane increased significantly while the concentration of ethylene and acetylene changed slightly it reveals that the reducibility of s nzvico 2 was improved and the hydrogenation reaction was promoted after 5 d of aging in contrast the concentrations of products by 5 day aged s nzvico 1 and s nzvico 3 remained almost constant it is known the low h atom density caused by s is not conducive to hydrogenolysis and the transformation from acetylene to ethylene and ethane is likely to occur in the high h atom density region phenrat and lowry 2019 thus the discrepancy in product distribution among these materials might be ascribed to the pits or crevices formed on the passive film of s nzvico 2 however it is generally believed that fe0 sites should be oxidized rapidly by water to form passive layer eq 6 mangayayam et al 2020 found that the corresponding anodic eq 15 and cathodic reactions eq 16 occur on locally separated sites hence these cracks allow more fe0 sites to be exposed for the hydrogenation reaction after 30 d of aging the total degradation rate changed slightly but the concentration of acetylene in the systems of s nzvico decreased and the main degradation product changed from ethylene to ethane this can be attributed to the oxidation of reductive sulfur species and formation of cracks on the passivation film as mentioned above nevertheless s nzvico almost lost the reactivity to degrade tce after 60 90 d of aging due to the massive depletion of fe0 and the formation of thick iron oxides shell 15 fe0 fe2 2e anodic sites 16 2e 2h2o h2 2oh cathodic sites compared with the systems of s nzvico ethylene was also the main degradation product by s nzvipost aged for 5 d but the accumulation of acetylene was lower in accordance with the effect of sulfur dose on the accumulation of acetylene as noted above the limited sulfur content introduced into s nzvipost could be the reason for low concentration of acetylene and due to the limited fe0 depletion and the formation of cracks non chlorinate products increased however after 30 d of aging except for ethane as the main degradation product of s nzvipost 3 the main degradation product of s nzvipost 1 and s nzvipost 2 was still ethylene this discrepancy should be caused by the lower content of reductive sulfur species and or more exposed fe0 sites in s nzvipost 3 reducing the Œ≤ elimination reaction rate which is consistent with the previous discussion in contrast to the s nzvico s nzvipost still showed a certain reactivity to degrade tce and the main degradation product was ethane after aging for 90 d the depletion of fe0 resulted in the decline of degradation but s nzvipost still kept a certain amount of reducibility it is noteworthy that through the qualitative analysis of chlorinated intermediates sulfidation procedures and sulfur precursors did not affect the degradation pathway of tce nevertheless the product distribution can be affected by the evolution of different types of s nzvi with the aging time to evaluate the selectivity of these particles the electron efficiency Œµe was calculated fig s9 for fresh particles the selectivity of all s nzvi particles was approximately 44 125 times higher than nzvi in addition the selectivity continued to increase during 30 d of aging however from day 30 to 90 selectivity of s nzvico decreased sharply while that of s nzvipost remained constant moreover the effect of sulfur precursors on selectivity is also different in the two kinds of sulfidation procedures for s nzvipost the selectivity of fresh and aged particles is in decreasing order of s nzvipost 1 s nzvipost 2 s nzvipost 3 which is consistent with the proportion of reductive sulfur species on the surface table s3 the similar correlation was shown between the selectivity of aged s nzvico and the proportion of reductive sulfur species whereas the selectivity of fresh s nzvico is in increasing order of s nzvico 1 s nzvico 3 s nzvico 2 as shown in fig 3a s nzvico 2 has the highest proportion of fes2 while s nzvico 3 has the highest proportion of fes and fesn it was reported that fes2 is more hydrophobic than fes gu et al 2019 xu et al 2020b while fes and fe3s4 have higher electron conductivity xu et al 2020a therefore it indicates that the selectivity of s nzvi depends on the combination of electron transfer capacity and hydrophobicity 4 conclusion the results of this work reveal that different sulfidation procedures and sulfur precursors control the morphology structure fe crystallinity the content and speciation of sulfur and the evolution of iron sulfides and iron oxides these physicochemical properties are critical factors affecting the reactivity of the fresh and aged s nzvi concretely speaking co sulfidation method can generate the s nzvico with higher crystallinity of fe0 and more sulfur content and inhibit the oxidation of iron sulfides in the synthesis process the reactivity of s nzvico to tce was higher than that of s nzvipost however in comparison the long term performance of s nzvipost was superior the sulfur reagents exhibit obvious differences in s nzvico which were mainly reflected in the size and crystallinity of fe0 as for s nzvipost sulfur reagents made a difference in the sulfur content on the surface thus sulfur precursors may play important and multiple roles in the properties of s nzvi during different synthesis conditions which can be chosen to optimize the performance of s nzvi according to the actual needs but further research is indispensable to give insight into the sulfidation mechanisms of different sulfur reagents to make out the key factors influencing the fe crystallinity moreover in this study the effect of sulfidation procedures on the long term performance in simulated groundwater is opposite to a previous research in deionized water xu et al 2019b it indicates that the influence of groundwater composition should be taken into account when it comes to evaluating the long term performance of s nzvi supporting information additional figures fig s1 s13 and tables table s1 s3 can be

capacity making estuaries shift from sinks to sources of n2o wells et al 2018 but the magnitude of this switch as n increases has been limitedly understood wells et al 2018 more studies on dynamics of estuarine n2o emissions and understanding how n2o emissions respond to changing environmental conditions are therefore crucial for the projection of n2o emissions from global estuaries estuaries are globally significant sources of n2o to atmosphere yan et al 2012 murray et al 2015 wells et al 2018 observing and modeling of estuary n2o emissions remain uncertain under the contexts of climate warming human activities and hydrologic conditions because these factors can cause high variability of water dissolved n2o concentrations and the production and reduction processes of n2o murray et al 2015 turner et al 2016 n concentration is the most significant proxy of the increases in water n2o emissions and oversaturation in estuaries murray et al 2015 wells et al 2018 other studies have also proposed that the temperature dissolved oxygen do and organic carbon have separate and combined effects on water dissolved n2o concentrations and fluxes in the estuaries allen et al 2011 murray et al 2015 2018 however many studies have documented that the large differences in n2o emissions across the subtropical estuaries are mainly attributed to the n concentrations murray et al 2018 wells et al 2018 2020 the fact that estuary n concentrations are increasing combined with the eutrophication can trigger denitrification and nitrification thereby leading to the increases in n2o production and emissions murray et al 2015 in addition hydrologic conditions can greatly affect n2o emissions by the fact that more water discharge and high turbidity can affect the biological processes of n2o production cooper et al 2017 xia et al 2017 although water flushing and residence time strongly and consistently affect water oxygen availability and turbulence how estuary water dissolved n2o concentrations and fluxes respond to changes in dry and wet seasons remain limited identifying the biologic sources of n2o would better project n2o emissions under multiple environmental variables in estuaries murray et al 2015 isotopic method is an available approach for characterizing the microbial processes of n2o production in natural environments toyoda et al 2009 wankel et al 2017 murray et al 2018 the Œ¥ 15n and Œ¥ 18o in n2o can shed light on processes of n2o production because each pathway has a unique effect on the stable isotope ratios 15n 14n 18o 16o murray et al 2018 because n2o has two sites including central Œ± site for Œ¥ 15nŒ± n2o and terminal Œ≤ site for Œ¥ 15nŒ≤ n2o toyoda and yoshida 1999 site preference defined as Œ¥ 15nŒ± n2o Œ¥ 15nŒ≤ n2o of n2o can also quantify the relative contributions of nitrification and denitrification to n2o production toyoda et al 2011 wankel et al 2017 of the two biologic processes denitrification can also consume n2o by reduction to n2 and is proposed to be the main process of n2o sink in estuaries eyre et al 2016 the n2o emissions are usually the net remaining part of n2o consumption after production and each process can cause isotopic effects of n2o toyoda et al 2011 in light of this isotopes and concentrations of no3 and nh4 combined with isotopes of n2o are of great significance in n2o sources partition in estuaries murray et al 2018 wells and eyre 2019 the projections of n2o emissions are highly variable due to large differences in environmental factors murray et al 2015 hu et al 2016 marzadri et al 2021 indirect n2o emission factor the ratio of dissolved n2o to dissolved inorganic n is increasingly used to upscale the indirect n2o emissions from aquatic environments the estimates of n2o emissions from global estuaries are projected based on the ipcc default value of 0 25 for estuary ipcc 2006 which indicate large uncertainty due to the high variability of indirect n2o emission factors with changing environmental conditions and across different estuaries murray et al 2015 it has been suggested that indirect n2o emission factors can decrease with increasing n concentrations wells et al 2018 and vary corresponding to different n forms hu et al 2016 the indirect n2o emission factors estimated by dividing dissolved n2o by no3 concentrations are also highly variable across different n concentrations and hydrologic rivers estuaries cooper et al 2017 wells et al 2018 water residence time and flushing capability can affect water dissolved n2o and no3 concentrations wells et al 2018 and further greatly affect indirect n2o emission factors in estuaries especially in the hydrologically modified estuaries cooper et al 2017 however the correlation between dissolved n2o and n concentrations and how dissolved n2o concentrations respond to different hydrologic characteristics and n concentrations in estuaries are constrained so far with this in mind we investigated dry and wet seasonal variations of dissolved n2o concentrations and fluxes and identified the sources of n2o emissions across five subtropical estuaries characterized by different hydrologic conditions and human impacts in southeast china the specific questions addressed in this study were to 1 investigate how water dissolved n2o concentrations and fluxes respond to the changes in seasons and hydrologic conditions across these estuaries 2 identify what are the crucial factors controlling the water n2o emissions and to quantify the relative contribution of nitrification and denitrification to n2o emissions 3 reevaluate the indirect n2o emission factors based on different estuary n concentrations and hydrologic characteristics this study provides available information for understanding of biogeochemical constraints on n2o emissions under changing hydrologic conditions and for refining indirect n2o emission factor and n2o projection of estuarine ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1

air temperature and wind speed varied between 23 5 and 32 5 c and between 1 5 and 2 8 m s 1 respectively across the seasons and estuaries table 2 water temperature ranged from 21 6 to 32 8 c across

in water dissolved n2o concentrations differed significantly across the seasons p 0 001 water n2o saturations varied significantly along the estuary gradient in these five estuaries p 0 001 fig s4 water n2o saturations varied from 118 to 615 in wet season fig 2c and from 126 to 531 in dry season fig 2d water n2o saturations also varied significantly between estuaries p 0 001 and the spatial variability varied between wet and dry seasons p 0 001 in jx and jj estuaries the water air n2o fluxes differed spatially along the estuary fig s5 the n2o fluxes ranged from 0 66 ¬µg m 2 h 1 in jx to 22 2 ¬µg m 2 h 1 in jlj whereas did not vary significantly between wet and dry seasons p 0 17 fig 2e 2f 3 3 sp value and sources of n2o bulk Œ¥ 15n no3 values fell between 0 35 and 6 15 and showed high variability in jj and jlj estuaries fig 3 a the Œ¥ 15n n2o values ranged from 2 86 to 11 31 and were higher in mlx jj and jlj estuaries fig 3b n2o had a Œ¥ 18o n2o between 16 73 and 34 78 across the estuaries and seasons fig s6a sp n2o fell between 1 58 and 11 72 which were maximal in mlx followed by jx and mj but minimal in jj and jlj there was a positive correlation between bulk Œ¥ 15n n2o

nitrification fungal and bacterial denitrification fig 3d the Œ¥ 15n n2o and sp n2o for jj and jlj were closer to denitrification nitrification was responsible for 18 66 38 08 of n2o emissions fig 3e and denitrification contributed 61 92 81 34 of n2o emissions fig 3f 3 4 controls on n2o concentration saturation and flux there was no significant relationship of water nh4 with 222rn fig 4 a 4b water dissolved n2o concentrations showed no significant correlation with 222rn concentrations in wet season fig 4c but increased with the increasing 222rn concentrations in mj and jj estuaries in dry season fig 4d water dissolved n2o concentrations saturations and fluxes increased progressively with the increasing no3 concentrations fig 5 water dissolved n2o concentrations saturations and fluxes were significantly affected by water temperature do and tn contents table 3 site taken as random factor also explained a considerable part of total variance about a 20 providing evidence that other non measured environmental traits also should play a significant role in water dissolved n2o concentrations and fluxes the best sem models showed that water n2o concentrations and saturations were mainly explained by water nh4 and do contents fig 6 a 6b n2o fluxes were mostly explained by water velocity and water and air temperature fig 6c water velocities that affected water no2 and no3 concentrations were the main direct factors affecting n2o fluxes 3 5 indirect n2o emission factor indirect n2o emission factors varied largely between 0 06 0 02 and 0 23 0 18 even though they did not differ significantly across these estuaries p 0 124 and between the wet and dry seasons p 0 316 fig 7 a average indirect n2o emission factors throughout the sampling cases were slightly higher in jx 0

0 25 the projected n2o fluxes based on ipcc default value were higher than the measured n2o fluxes fig 7c n2o emission factors decreased with the increasing tn concentrations fig 8 particularly in jj and jlj estuaries p 0 001 4 discussion 4 1 estuaries as sources of n2o emissions estuaries can emit and assimilate n2o under different environmental conditions the increasing water dissolved n2o concentrations could cause the net n2o sources in estuaries murray et al 2015 2018 wells et al 2018 in our study the water dissolved n2o concentrations increased from 15 8 jx to 84 9 nmol l 1 jj corresponding to the changes in tn concentrations however wells et al 2018 reported that the water dissolved n2o concentrations ranged from 13 5 to 22 1 nmol l 1 from low to high impact estuaries in subtropical australia water tn concentrations were 0 38 0 68 mg l 1 across the subtropical estuaries in subtropical australia wells et al 2018 which were lower than those in our study 0 64 5 59 mg l 1 this comparison suggests that water dissolved n2o concentrations increase positively with the increasing n concentrations in the estuaries benthic denitrification and nitrification are highly fueled by the high n concentrations in estuaries teixeira et al 2010 thereby leading to the increases in magnitudes of n2o production and n2o oversaturation murray et al 2015 these five estuaries surveyed captured one order of magnitude tn concentrations likely because local human activity intensities dominate the water n concentrations over watershed inputs teixeira et al 2010 wells et al 2018 the tn concentrations were lower in jx low impact than in other estuaries that are the highly urbanized estuaries table 1 in these estuaries dissolved n2o concentrations increased significantly with the increasing tn concentrations especially in mlx jj and jlj estuaries showing 6 10 times higher than the average concentration of 0 51 mg n l 1 from global rivers hu et al 2016 in addition the water n2o saturations in mlx jj and jlj ranged from 360 to 615 which were significantly higher than those in jx and mj 118 195 we found the broad correlations between water tn and n2o concentration and saturation table s1 and that both water no3 and nh4 concentrations explained a significant portion of the differences in dissolved n2o concentrations and saturations between the estuaries the good michaelis menten functions between n2o concentration and saturation with no3 concentration however indicated that n2o concentrations and saturations increased as the n concentrations increase the water n2o emissions calculated through scaling up the dissolved n2o concentrations were in a range of 0 66 22 2 ¬µg m 2 h 1 which were in agreement with the fluxes of 1 31 19 6 ¬µg m 2 h 1 in subtropical australia with different human impacts wells et al 2018 however water n2o emissions from the five estuaries were on average 7 23 ¬µg m 2 h 1 which were lower than the global average n2o fluxes from estuarine water 33 4 ¬µg m 2 h 1 murray et al 2015 and rivers 31 7 ¬µg m 2 h 1 marzadri et al 2021 but were higher than the n2o emissions from the mangrove wetlands in burdekin estuary 1 16 ¬µg m 2 h 1 and fitzroy estuary 2 22 ¬µg m 2 h 1 murray et al 2018 and constant creek 0 04 to 6 ¬µg m 2 h 1 murray et al 2020 these comparisons suggest that estuary waters are the hot spots of n2o emissions relative to estuary wetlands the high variability of n2o emissions across the five estuaries indicated that n2o emissions varied with the concomitant water n concentrations increases it also should be noted that although mj is a highly urbanized estuary the concentrations of no3 and tn were lower relative to other urbanized estuaries due to the large water discharge and water flow table 1 thereby making mj lower areal water n2o fluxes the large variabilities of n2o fluxes 7 33 fold between the five estuaries may be attributed to that the estuarine k values are parameterized particularly in n rich estuaries where small differences can present a large effect on the calculated n2o emissions wells et al 2018 these results mean that human activity is increasingly driving n2o emissions from estuaries by modifying n loads to rivers and perhaps that in recent decades some estuaries have shifted from sinks to sources of n2o 4 2 environmental controls on estuarine n2o emissions estuary n2o emissions are highly dependent on water dissolved n2o concentrations and environmental factors murray et al 2015 wells et al 2018 in addition to n concentrations meteorological and water parameters also showed important effects on dissolved n2o concentrations and emissions the difference in temperature between wet and dry seasons can drive the seasonal variability of water dissolved n2o concentrations and emissions within an individual estuary however high temperature can also strongly accelerate sediment oxygen consumption and organic carbon availability which in return increase denitrification rates and n2o yield because denitrifiers are more active in low oxygen and high carbon conditions eyre et al 2013 the high n estuaries seemed to emit higher amounts of n2o than low n estuaries possibly because oxygen decline and high no3 concentrations together trigger sediment denitrification wang et al 2021 leading to more n2o diffusion fig s7a some studies also expect spatial and seasonal differences in water n2o emissions most due to the spatial and seasonal changes in doc concentrations and or doc no3 ratios murray et al 2018 wang et al 2021 except for water n concentrations causing lower dissolved n2o concentrations and emissions in jx and mj than in other estuaries we also expected that these differences could be associated with high ratios of doc no3 in jx and mj 12 8 24 6 estuaries leading to greater consumption of n2o by denitrifying microbes murray et al 2018 in addition in terms of the three high water n estuaries jj estuary presented inverse seasonal patterns of dissolved n2o concentrations and emissions compared to mlx and jlj estuaries which may be also attributed to that the doc no3 ratios in dry season were greater in jj 8 19 14 9 than in mlx and jlj 1 71 4 14 estuaries from these results however we can conclude that estuarine n2o emissions would be sensitive to the changes of doc and no3 concentrations and estuary can easily shift from low to high emissions of n2o estuaries are characterized by a salinity gradient which can either influence the biogeochemistry of the water but also leads to oxygen minimum zones with increased turbidity saline conditions are more favorable for the nitrifiers marty et al 2001 n2o reduction could thus be enhanced by nitrifier denitrification shaw et al 2006 thereby decreasing n2o emissions in estuary mouths notably do was minimal but suspended sediment was maximal in mlx estuary which could be attributed to that the large suspended sediment fuels water oxygen depletion through increasing interface areas of biogeochemical reactions xia et al 2017 in this case the significant variability of water suspended sediment between wet and dry seasons in mlx estuary could also drive the seasonal differences in do table 2 high water velocity can decrease water residence time and weaken environmental stabilities of biogeochemical reactions cooper et al 2017 which can decrease water n2o accumulation and limit n2o diffusion from sediment to water our study also showed that n2o emissions decreased with the increasing water velocity and a significant negative relationship was found between them it also should be noted that the mj estuary characterized by the largest n concentrations showed the lower n2o emissions compared to other urbanized estuaries mostly due to the large discharge and water flow minimizing the water n concentrations the sem model showed that temperature has a direct effect favoring n2o fluxes consistently with previous studies reino et al 2017 whereas water temperature was inversely related to n2o fluxes effect consistent with the rises in n2o solubility constant with increasing water temperature yaghai and houache 2008 the linear mixed model confirmed that n2o formation and fluxes were mainly directly determined by water concentrations of nitrogen and oxygen but also indirectly affected by water and air temperature and water velocity there was no significant relationship of 222rn concentrations with nh4 and dissolved n2o concentrations throughout the estuaries in wet season nh4 concentrations peaked at the 222rn concentrations of 2000 2500 dpm m 3 in jj and jlj estuaries where there was also the n2o maxima however in dry season the nh4 concentrations increased at the same levels of 222rn concentrations making it impossible to discern whether the changes in nh4 come from either groundwater or surface water inputs the water dissolved n2o concentrations did not respond linearly to 222rn concentrations but peaked at the 222rn concentrations of 2000 2500 dpm m 3 in wet season the overall data of the estuaries in dry season showed that n2o concentrations increased with the increasing 222rn concentrations but within estuary changes did not further suggesting that groundwater may not drive the spatial and temporal variations of water dissolved n2o concentrations in addition the 222rn concentrations decreased from freshwater to estuary mouth which were not consistent with the tendency of dissolved n2o concentrations within an estuary the number of sewage along the studied estuaries were 2 22 which were minimal in jx and maximal in mj high dissolved n2o concentrations in jj and jlj estuaries representing more sewage outlets could therefore reflect direct sewage n2o inputs however high dissolved n2o concentrations were not observed in mj where there were 22 sewage outlets this inconsistency of n2o concentrations in response to sewage inputs likely suggest that sewage inputs may not dominate water dissolved n2o concentrations it has been also reported that internal biogeochemical processes rather than external inputs contribute dominantly to water n2o dynamics in high n concentrations estuaries wells et al 2018 these results mean that groundwater and wastewater n2o inputs were both unlikely to substantially affect surface water n2o dynamics in the studied estuaries 4 3 biological sources of n2o emissions biologic processes and allochthonous sources of no3 can affect the Œ¥ 15n no3 values in estuaries murray et al 2018 wells and eyre 2019 across the estuaries the highest average value of Œ¥ 15n no3 4 09 was observed in jx estuary mostly because denitrification can increase the value of Œ¥ 15n no3 wells and eyre 2019 by the fact that denitrifying bacteria are highly dependent on no3 under low n conditions granger et al 2008 the low variability of Œ¥ 15n no3 across the sampling cases in jx estuary indicated that natural sources mainly contribute to the water no3 wells and eyre 2019 the values of Œ¥ 15n no3 were minimal in mj between 0 82 and 2 75 which could be attributed to that the oxidation of nh4 to no3 can low the Œ¥ 15n no3 and that large freshwater dominates the Œ¥ 15n no3 because the lowest Œ¥ 15n no3 generally appears in upper reaches murray et al 2020 because the water suspended sediment was maximal in mlx estuary water no3 derived from soil leach was then denitrified resulting in a higher value of Œ¥ 15n no3 in addition that nh4 is nitrified to no3 on the surface of suspended sediment can decrease Œ¥ 15n no3 values murray et al 2018 the high variability of Œ¥ 15n no3 values in jj and jlj as the high n estuaries 0 10 to 8 47 for jj and 0 35 to 6 08 for jlj reflected that water no3 is derived from a source abundant with a higher Œ¥ 15n no3 signature of sewage inputs murray et al 2018 and is associated with fertilizer murray et al 2020 and could also reflect an in situ no3 production process lowing Œ¥ 15n no3 values wells and eyre 2019 it has been reported that n2o produced from nitrification has a higher sp toyoda et al 2011 fungal denitrification could also contribute to the sp increase in mlx likely due to that no3 delivered from nitrification can fuel n2o production through fungal denitrification wankel et al 2017 however the reduction of n2o to n2 can increase sp of the remaining n2o as well as the Œ¥ 15n value wankel et al 2017 the low n2o emissions but high sp of n2o in jx and mj estuaries indicated that complete denitrification could be responsible for the n2o reduction thereby resulting in a higher sp of n2o the sp also decreased under the high estuarine n2o saturations and dissolved n2o concentrations which further indicated that n2o could be mainly produced from bacterial denitrification murray et al 2018 throughout these five estuaries the sp values of water dissolved n2o varied between 1 58 and 11 72 suggesting that the dissolved n2o was produced from both nitrification and denitrification wenk et al 2016 in addition the negative correlation between Œ¥ 15n and sp in n2o also indicated that the n2o was partially produced by nitrification in these estuaries the net isotope effects and expected range of Œ¥ 15nbulk and sp of n2o have been employed to interpret the bacterial and fungal denitrification as well as nitrification for the n2o production all the data measured for these estuaries fell between bacterial and fungal denitrification and nitrification indicating that denitrification and nitrification were responsible for the n2o emissions in these estuaries the fungal denitrification showed smaller effects on Œ¥ 15nbulk and sp of n2o in jj and jlj relative to other estuaries which may be attributed to that high n concentrations can inhibit fungal biomass and low c n 25 conditions are not favorable for fungal community activity moore et al 2020 4 4 indirect n2o emission factor across subtropical estuaries indirect n2o emission factors are highly variable with changing environmental factors and across different estuaries kroeze et al 2005 in this study the indirect n2o emission factors varied largely between 0 06 and 0 23 4 times higher but they did not differ significantly across the estuaries p 0 124 and between wet and dry seasons p 0 316 however the average indirect n2o emission factor throughout the four seasons was relatively higher in jx fig 7b the reason could be that water no3 contents were minimal in this estuary in terms of the high n estuaries of jj and jlj the indirect n2o emission factors were higher in jj than jlj likely due to that jj had higher n2o concentrations but lower no3 contents relative to jlj in addition the average indirect n2o emission factors were mostly consistent in mj 0 082 mlx 0 088 and jj 0 086 indicating that the three estuaries may have proportionable n2o production in response to the coincident no3 and further evidencing no3 dependence of water dissolved n2o concentrations murray et al 2015 the different seasonal variability of indirect n2o emission factors across these estuaries indicated that n2o emissions in low n estuaries can be favored in dry season while wet season may be more favorable for n2o emissions in high n estuaries likely due to that the high water flow can upwell the n2o from benthic to surface water turner et al 2016 wells et al 2018 the global estuarine n2o emissions could be overestimated since they ignore the decline of emission factors with increasing n concentrations and channel size hu et al 2016 wells et al 2018 and neglect the differences in emission factors corresponding to different n forms murray et al 2015 the global estuarine n2o emissions are extrapolated that n2o is emitted as a 1 of inorganic n including nh4 no3 and no2 entering in estuaries kroeze et al 2005 these estimates are based on assumption that all n2o is produced from the surface water inorganic n but they ignores estuary benthic environments that present large n2o emissions potential kroeze et al 2005 murray et al 2015 the ipcc default value of 0 25 is estimated based on the assumptions that n is only nitrified and denitrified as well as n2o production from the two processes ipcc 2006 the indirect n2o emission factor in these subtropical estuaries was on average 0 11 which was estimated as the ratio of dissolved n2on concentration to no3 n concentration if we used inorganic n the indirect n2o emission factor would be less than 0 11 the indirect n2o emission factor of this study was also lower than the ipcc default value 0 25 ipcc et al 2006 and global rivers 0 17 marzadri et al 2021 the global n2o emissions estimates of estuarine environments were in a range of 0 15 0 91 tg n2on yr 1 murray et al 2015 representing 1 2 7 3 of the global terrestrial n2o emissions averaging 12 5 tg n2o n yr 1 tian et al 2015 therefore although the indirect n2o emission factors vary slightly the estimates of n2o emissions through upscaling global estuaries based on these emission factors would be large uncertain 4 5 implication for estuarine n2o emissions n2o production processes are kinetically dependent on no3 substrate turner et al 2016 wang et al 2021 we therefore used the michaelis menten kinetics to present n2o concentrations saturations and fluxes in response to no3 concentrations fig 5 in subtropical watershed of southeast china the long time data and models project a 55 increase of no3 transported into estuaries by the year 2050 zhang and chen 2014 which would increase n2o emissions from these estuaries by 31 17 48 based on the relationship in fig 5 conversely a regression model estimates that a 30 decline of net anthropogenic nitrogen inputs from the watershed can decrease no3 export by 21 into estuaries zhang and chen 2014 in light of this dissolved n2o concentrations in the studied estuaries would be decreased by 13 7 19 implying a substantial reduction in n2o emissions from these estuaries however n2o production processes are influenced by secondary factors turner et al 2016 for instance an increase in water turbidity stimulating nitrifying bacteria would enhance nitrification that can yield both n2o and no3 xia et al 2017 and therefore these projections likely represent a lower estimate in wet season in addition above extrapolation of n2o emissions under the n changes may be underestimated because n concentrations from waste water treatment plant have not been mentioned in addition in terms of warming potential and co2 balance of estuarine environments the areal emissions of estuary n2o in co2 equiv in this study could offset 4 9 of average co2 sink of china estuaries 32 49 mg co2 m 2 h 1 estimated by the invest model yi 2017 these results suggest that estuaries are positive contributors to climate warming and highlight the urgency of controlled estuarine n2o emissions it has been reported that n2o emissions are mainly controlled by n p stoichiometry not the c availability in the highly impacted estuaries wells et al 2018 the high n p ratios in the high n estuaries reflected the possibility that n enrichments on biologic growth could be increasing n2o production by favoring the microbial n cycling rather than the n assimilatory growth in addition nutrient substrate could amplify estuarine ecological consequences like decline of dissolved oxygen combined with high n concentrations which would many fold produce n2o the low n2o emissions observed in the estuary with large discharge and water flow indicated that the large remaining n could be directly transported into estuarine and coastal zones potentially exacerbating eutrophication and hypoxia the eutrophic and hypoxic estuaries in return face the functioning degradation from n retainer to reactors and even pipes wells et al 2018 wells and eyre 2019 therefore estuarine and coastal n2o emissions would be intensified and highly variable under the contexts of increased n conditions and hydrologic changes 5 conclusions in this study water dissolved n2o concentrations were lower in the estuaries characterized by large discharge and water flow even though they presented high n concentrations but despite n2o saturations and fluxes varied significantly across the estuaries and were higher in the estuaries with high n concentrations dissolved n2o concentrations were also strongly and significantly determined directly by water n and do concentrations and more indirectly by water temperature and velocity the low n2o fluxes but high sp of n2o indicated that complete denitrification was responsible for the decline of n2o emissions indirect n2o emission factors from these estuaries were lower than the ipcc default value indicating the decline of indirect n2o emission factor with the increasing water n concentrations average n2o emissions in co2 equiv estimated in this study could offset 4 9 of average co2 sink of china estuaries these results suggest that hydrologic conditions and n concentrations codetermine the dynamics of estuary n2o emissions and that subtropical estuaries are critical for n2o emission

16258,estuaries are expected to contribute large nitrous oxide n2o emissions however the environmental controls and implications of n2o emissions have not been well understood here we investigated water n2o concentrations fluxes and sources in wet and dry seasons for 2019 2020 in five subtropical estuaries spanning hydrologic characteristics and nitrogen concentrations gradient water dissolved n2o concentrations and fluxes were in a range of 15 8 84 9 nmol l 1 and 0 66 22 2 ¬µg m 2 h 1 respectively these studied estuaries were oversaturated in n2o with the saturations of 118 615 water dissolved n2o concentrations saturations and fluxes increased significantly as nitrogen concentrations increase whereas they did not differ significantly between the wet and dry seasons water n2o emissions however were also lower in the estuaries characterized by large discharge and water flow n2o saturations and fluxes were determined directly by water nitrogen and oxygen concentrations and more indirectly by water temperature and velocity the Œ¥ 15n n2o and site preference n2o varied respectively from 2 86 to 11 31 and from 1 58 to 11 72 which overlapped the values between nitrification and denitrification nitrification and denitrification were responsible for 18 7 38 1 and 61 9 81 3 of n2o emissions respectively indirect n2o emission factors were 0 08 0 14 and decreased with increasing total nitrogen concentrations it is estimated that water n2o emissions in co2 equiv could offset approximately 4 9 of average co2 sink of china estuaries therefore these results suggest that nitrogen concentrations and hydrologic characteristics together modify n2o emissions and that estuaries may be the important contributors to n2o emissions graphical abstract image graphical

doubled nitrogen n concentrations on terrestrial environments resulting in large emissions of n2o murray et al 2015 hu et al 2016 wu et al 2017 guo et al 2021 and the increase in atmospheric n2o concentration that has been estimated at a rate of 0 73 ppb yr 1 ipcc 2014 estuarine and coastal environments receive large n inputs from agricultural industrial and house discharge and are responsible for approximately 60 of the total oceanic n2o flux to atmosphere murray et al 2018 the increasing n2o yield triggered by high n concentrations can exceed estuarine n2o assimilative capacity making estuaries shift from sinks to sources of n2o wells et al 2018 but the magnitude of this switch as n increases has been limitedly understood wells et al 2018 more studies on dynamics of estuarine n2o emissions and understanding how n2o emissions respond to changing environmental conditions are therefore crucial for the projection of n2o emissions from global estuaries estuaries are globally significant sources of n2o to atmosphere yan et al 2012 murray et al 2015 wells et al 2018 observing and modeling of estuary n2o emissions remain uncertain under the contexts of climate warming human activities and hydrologic conditions because these factors can cause high variability of water dissolved n2o concentrations and the production and reduction processes of n2o murray et al 2015 turner et al 2016 n concentration is the most significant proxy of the increases in water n2o emissions and oversaturation in estuaries murray et al 2015 wells et al 2018 other studies have also proposed that the temperature dissolved oxygen do and organic carbon have separate and combined effects on water dissolved n2o concentrations and fluxes in the estuaries allen et al 2011 murray et al 2015 2018 however many studies have documented that the large differences in n2o emissions across the subtropical estuaries are mainly attributed to the n concentrations murray et al 2018 wells et al 2018 2020 the fact that estuary n concentrations are increasing combined with the eutrophication can trigger denitrification and nitrification thereby leading to the increases in n2o production and emissions murray et al 2015 in addition hydrologic conditions can greatly affect n2o emissions by the fact that more water discharge and high turbidity can affect the biological processes of n2o production cooper et al 2017 xia et al 2017 although water flushing and residence time strongly and consistently affect water oxygen availability and turbulence how estuary water dissolved n2o concentrations and fluxes respond to changes in dry and wet seasons remain limited identifying the biologic sources of n2o would better project n2o emissions under multiple environmental variables in estuaries murray et al 2015 isotopic method is an available approach for characterizing the microbial processes of n2o production in natural environments toyoda et al 2009 wankel et al 2017 murray et al 2018 the Œ¥ 15n and Œ¥ 18o in n2o can shed light on processes of n2o production because each pathway has a unique effect on the stable isotope ratios 15n 14n 18o 16o murray et al 2018 because n2o has two sites including central Œ± site for Œ¥ 15nŒ± n2o and terminal Œ≤ site for Œ¥ 15nŒ≤ n2o toyoda and yoshida 1999 site preference defined as Œ¥ 15nŒ± n2o Œ¥ 15nŒ≤ n2o of n2o can also quantify the relative contributions of nitrification and denitrification to n2o production toyoda et al 2011 wankel et al 2017 of the two biologic processes denitrification can also consume n2o by reduction to n2 and is proposed to be the main process of n2o sink in estuaries eyre et al 2016 the n2o emissions are usually the net remaining part of n2o consumption after production and each process can cause isotopic effects of n2o toyoda et al 2011 in light of this isotopes and concentrations of no3 and nh4 combined with isotopes of n2o are of great significance in n2o sources partition in estuaries murray et al 2018 wells and eyre 2019 the projections of n2o emissions are highly variable due to large differences in environmental factors murray et al 2015 hu et al 2016 marzadri et al 2021 indirect n2o emission factor the ratio of dissolved n2o to dissolved inorganic n is increasingly used to upscale the indirect n2o emissions from aquatic environments the estimates of n2o emissions from global estuaries are projected based on the ipcc default value of 0 25 for estuary ipcc 2006 which indicate large uncertainty due to the high variability of indirect n2o emission factors with changing environmental conditions and across different estuaries murray et al 2015 it has been suggested that indirect n2o emission factors can decrease with increasing n concentrations wells et al 2018 and vary corresponding to different n forms hu et al 2016 the indirect n2o emission factors estimated by dividing dissolved n2o by no3 concentrations are also highly variable across different n concentrations and hydrologic rivers estuaries cooper et al 2017 wells et al 2018 water residence time and flushing capability can affect water dissolved n2o and no3 concentrations wells et al 2018 and further greatly affect indirect n2o emission factors in estuaries especially in the hydrologically modified estuaries cooper et al 2017 however the correlation between dissolved n2o and n concentrations and how dissolved n2o concentrations respond to different hydrologic characteristics and n concentrations in estuaries are constrained so far with this in mind we investigated dry and wet seasonal variations of dissolved n2o concentrations and fluxes and identified the sources of n2o emissions across five subtropical estuaries characterized by different hydrologic conditions and human impacts in southeast china the specific questions addressed in this study were to 1 investigate how water dissolved n2o concentrations and fluxes respond to the changes in seasons and hydrologic conditions across these estuaries 2 identify what are the crucial factors controlling the water n2o emissions and to quantify the relative contribution of nitrification and denitrification to n2o emissions 3 reevaluate the indirect n2o emission factors based on different estuary n concentrations and hydrologic characteristics this study provides available information for understanding of biogeochemical constraints on n2o emissions under changing hydrologic conditions and for refining indirect n2o emission factor and n2o projection of estuarine ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1

high variability in jj and jlj estuaries fig 3 a the Œ¥ 15n n2o values ranged from 2 86 to 11 31 and were higher in mlx jj and jlj estuaries fig 3b n2o had a Œ¥ 18o n2o between 16 73 and 34 78 across the estuaries and seasons fig s6a sp n2o fell between 1 58 and 11 72 which were maximal in mlx followed by jx and mj but minimal in jj and jlj there was a positive correlation between bulk Œ¥ 15n n2o

dissolved n2o concentrations showed no significant correlation with 222rn concentrations in wet season fig 4c but increased with the increasing 222rn concentrations in mj and jj estuaries in dry

were significantly affected by water temperature do and tn contents table 3 site taken as random factor also explained a considerable part of total variance about a 20 providing evidence that other non measured environmental traits also should play a significant role in water dissolved n2o concentrations and fluxes the best sem models showed that water n2o concentrations and saturations were mainly explained by water nh4 and do contents fig 6 a 6b n2o fluxes were mostly explained by water velocity and water and air temperature fig 6c water velocities that affected water no2 and no3 concentrations were the main direct factors affecting n2o fluxes 3 5 indirect n2o emission factor indirect n2o emission factors varied largely between 0 06 0 02 and 0 23 0 18 even though they did not differ significantly across these estuaries p 0 124 and between the wet and dry seasons p 0 316 fig 7 a average indirect n2o emission factors throughout the sampling cases were slightly higher in jx 0 130 and jj 0 137 than in mj 0 082 mlx 0 088 and jlj 0 086 fig 7b even though they were not significantly different the emission factors from these estuaries were much lower than the ipcc default value 0 25 the projected n2o fluxes based on ipcc default value were higher than the measured n2o fluxes fig 7c n2o emission factors decreased with the increasing tn concentrations fig 8 particularly in jj and jlj estuaries p 0 001 4 discussion 4 1 estuaries as sources of n2o emissions estuaries can emit and assimilate n2o under different environmental conditions the increasing water dissolved n2o concentrations could cause the net n2o sources in estuaries murray et al 2015 2018 wells et al 2018 in our study the water dissolved n2o concentrations increased from 15 8 jx to 84 9 nmol l 1 jj corresponding to the changes in tn concentrations however wells et al 2018 reported that the water dissolved n2o concentrations ranged from 13 5 to 22 1 nmol l 1 from low to high impact estuaries in subtropical australia water tn concentrations were 0 38 0 68 mg l 1 across the subtropical estuaries in subtropical australia wells et al 2018 which were lower than those in our study 0 64 5 59 mg l 1 this comparison suggests that water dissolved n2o concentrations increase positively with the increasing n concentrations in the estuaries benthic denitrification and nitrification are highly fueled by the high n concentrations in estuaries teixeira et al 2010 thereby leading to the increases in magnitudes of n2o production and n2o oversaturation murray et al 2015 these five estuaries surveyed captured one order of magnitude tn concentrations likely because local human activity intensities dominate the water n concentrations over watershed inputs teixeira et al 2010 wells et al 2018 the tn concentrations were lower in jx low impact than in other estuaries that are the highly urbanized estuaries table 1 in these estuaries dissolved n2o concentrations increased significantly with the increasing tn concentrations especially in mlx jj and jlj estuaries showing 6 10 times higher than the average concentration of 0 51 mg n l 1 from global rivers hu et al 2016 in addition the water n2o saturations in mlx jj and jlj ranged from 360 to 615 which were significantly higher than those in jx and mj 118 195 we found the broad correlations between water tn and n2o concentration and saturation table s1 and that both water no3 and nh4 concentrations explained a significant portion of the differences in dissolved n2o concentrations and saturations between the estuaries the good michaelis menten functions between n2o concentration and saturation with no3 concentration however indicated that n2o concentrations and saturations increased as the n concentrations increase the water n2o emissions calculated through scaling up the dissolved n2o concentrations were in a range of 0 66 22 2 ¬µg m 2 h 1 which were in agreement with the fluxes of 1 31 19 6 ¬µg m 2 h 1 in subtropical australia with different human impacts wells et al 2018 however water n2o emissions from the five estuaries were on average 7 23 ¬µg m 2 h 1 which were lower than the global average n2o fluxes from estuarine water 33 4 ¬µg m 2 h 1 murray et al 2015 and rivers 31 7 ¬µg m 2 h 1 marzadri et al 2021 but were higher than the n2o emissions from the mangrove wetlands in burdekin estuary 1 16 ¬µg m 2 h 1 and fitzroy estuary 2 22 ¬µg m 2 h 1 murray et al 2018 and constant creek 0 04 to 6 ¬µg m 2 h 1 murray et al 2020 these comparisons suggest that estuary waters are the hot spots of n2o emissions relative to estuary wetlands the high variability of n2o emissions across the five estuaries indicated that n2o emissions varied with the concomitant water n concentrations increases it also should be noted that although mj is a highly urbanized estuary the concentrations of no3 and tn were lower relative to other urbanized estuaries due to the large water discharge and water flow table 1 thereby making mj lower areal water n2o fluxes the large variabilities of n2o fluxes 7 33 fold between the five estuaries may be attributed to that the estuarine k values are parameterized particularly in n rich estuaries where small differences can present a large effect on the calculated n2o emissions wells et al 2018 these results mean that human activity is increasingly driving n2o emissions from estuaries by modifying n loads to rivers and perhaps that in recent decades some estuaries have shifted from sinks to sources of n2o 4 2 environmental controls on estuarine n2o emissions estuary n2o emissions are highly dependent on water dissolved n2o concentrations and environmental factors murray et al 2015 wells et al 2018 in addition to n concentrations meteorological and water parameters also showed important effects on dissolved n2o concentrations and emissions the difference in temperature between wet and dry seasons can drive the seasonal variability of water dissolved n2o concentrations and emissions within an individual estuary however high temperature can also strongly accelerate sediment oxygen consumption and organic carbon availability which in return increase denitrification rates and n2o yield because denitrifiers are more active in low oxygen and high carbon conditions eyre et al 2013 the high n estuaries seemed to emit higher amounts of n2o than low n estuaries possibly because oxygen decline and high no3 concentrations together trigger sediment denitrification wang et al 2021 leading to more n2o diffusion fig s7a some studies also expect spatial and seasonal differences in water n2o emissions most due to the spatial and seasonal changes in doc concentrations and or doc no3 ratios murray et al 2018 wang et al 2021 except for water n concentrations causing lower dissolved n2o concentrations and emissions in jx and mj than in other estuaries we also expected that these differences could be associated with high ratios of doc no3 in jx and mj 12 8 24 6 estuaries leading to greater consumption of n2o by denitrifying microbes murray et al 2018 in addition in terms of the three high water n estuaries jj estuary presented inverse seasonal patterns of dissolved n2o concentrations and emissions compared to mlx and jlj estuaries which may be also attributed to that the doc no3 ratios in dry season were greater in jj 8 19 14 9 than in mlx and jlj 1 71 4 14 estuaries from these results however we can conclude that estuarine n2o emissions would be sensitive to the changes of doc and no3 concentrations and estuary can easily shift from low to high emissions of n2o estuaries are characterized by a salinity gradient which can either influence the biogeochemistry of the water but also leads to oxygen minimum zones with increased turbidity saline conditions are more favorable for the nitrifiers marty et al 2001 n2o reduction could thus be enhanced by nitrifier denitrification shaw et al 2006 thereby decreasing n2o emissions in estuary mouths notably do was minimal but suspended sediment was maximal in mlx estuary which could be attributed to that the large suspended sediment fuels water oxygen depletion through increasing interface areas of biogeochemical reactions xia et al 2017 in this case the significant variability of water suspended sediment between wet and dry seasons in mlx estuary could also drive the seasonal differences in do table 2 high water velocity can decrease water residence time and weaken environmental stabilities of biogeochemical reactions cooper et al 2017 which can decrease water n2o accumulation and limit n2o diffusion from sediment to water our study also showed that n2o emissions decreased with the increasing water velocity and a significant negative relationship was found between them it also should be noted that the mj estuary characterized by the largest n concentrations showed the lower n2o emissions compared to other urbanized estuaries mostly due to the large discharge and water flow minimizing the water n concentrations the sem model showed that temperature has a direct effect favoring n2o fluxes consistently with previous studies reino et al 2017 whereas water temperature was inversely related to n2o fluxes effect consistent with the rises in n2o solubility constant with increasing water temperature yaghai and houache 2008 the linear mixed model confirmed that n2o formation and fluxes were mainly directly determined by water concentrations of nitrogen and oxygen but also indirectly affected by water and air temperature and water velocity there was no significant relationship of 222rn concentrations with nh4 and dissolved n2o concentrations throughout the estuaries in wet season nh4 concentrations peaked at the 222rn concentrations of 2000 2500 dpm m 3 in jj and jlj estuaries where there was also the n2o maxima however in dry season the nh4 concentrations increased at the same levels of 222rn concentrations making it impossible to discern whether the changes in nh4 come from either groundwater or surface water inputs the water dissolved n2o concentrations did not respond linearly to 222rn concentrations but peaked at the 222rn concentrations of 2000 2500 dpm m 3 in wet season the overall data of the estuaries in dry season showed that n2o concentrations increased with the increasing 222rn concentrations but within estuary changes did not further suggesting that groundwater may not drive the spatial and temporal variations of water dissolved n2o concentrations in addition the 222rn concentrations decreased from freshwater to estuary mouth which were not consistent with the tendency of dissolved n2o concentrations within an estuary the number of sewage along the studied estuaries were 2 22 which were minimal in jx and maximal in mj high dissolved n2o concentrations in jj and jlj estuaries representing more sewage outlets could therefore reflect direct sewage n2o inputs however high dissolved n2o concentrations were not observed in mj where there were 22 sewage outlets this inconsistency of n2o concentrations in response to sewage inputs likely suggest that sewage inputs may not dominate water dissolved n2o concentrations it has been also reported that internal biogeochemical processes rather than external inputs contribute dominantly to water n2o dynamics in high n concentrations estuaries wells et al 2018 these results mean that groundwater and wastewater n2o inputs were both unlikely to substantially affect surface water n2o dynamics in the studied estuaries 4 3 biological sources of n2o emissions biologic processes and allochthonous sources of no3 can affect the Œ¥ 15n no3 values in estuaries murray et al 2018 wells and eyre 2019 across the estuaries the highest average value of Œ¥ 15n no3 4 09 was observed in jx estuary mostly because denitrification can increase the value of Œ¥ 15n no3 wells and eyre 2019 by the fact that denitrifying bacteria are highly dependent on no3 under low n conditions granger et al 2008 the low variability of Œ¥ 15n no3 across the sampling cases in jx estuary indicated that natural sources mainly contribute to the water no3 wells and eyre 2019 the values of Œ¥ 15n no3 were minimal in mj between 0 82 and 2 75 which could be attributed to that the oxidation of nh4 to no3 can low the Œ¥ 15n no3 and that large freshwater dominates the Œ¥ 15n no3 because the lowest Œ¥ 15n no3 generally appears in upper reaches murray et al 2020 because the water suspended sediment was maximal in mlx estuary water no3 derived from soil leach was then denitrified resulting in a higher value of Œ¥ 15n no3 in addition that nh4 is nitrified to no3 on the surface of suspended sediment can decrease Œ¥ 15n no3 values murray et al 2018 the high variability of Œ¥ 15n no3 values in jj and jlj as the high n estuaries 0 10 to 8 47 for jj and 0 35 to 6 08 for jlj reflected that water no3 is derived from a source abundant with a higher Œ¥ 15n no3 signature of sewage inputs murray et al 2018 and is associated with fertilizer murray et al 2020 and could also reflect an in situ no3 production process lowing Œ¥ 15n no3 values wells and eyre 2019 it has been reported that n2o produced from nitrification has a higher sp toyoda et al 2011 fungal denitrification could also contribute to the sp increase in mlx likely due to that no3 delivered from nitrification can fuel n2o production through fungal denitrification wankel et al 2017 however the reduction of n2o to n2 can increase sp of the remaining n2o as well as the Œ¥ 15n value wankel et al 2017 the low n2o emissions but high sp of n2o in jx and mj estuaries indicated that complete denitrification could be responsible for the n2o reduction thereby resulting in a higher sp of n2o the sp also decreased under the high estuarine n2o saturations and dissolved n2o concentrations which further indicated that n2o could be mainly produced from bacterial denitrification murray et al 2018 throughout these five estuaries the sp values of water dissolved n2o varied between 1 58 and 11 72 suggesting that the dissolved n2o was produced from both nitrification and denitrification wenk et al 2016 in addition the negative correlation between Œ¥ 15n and sp in n2o also indicated that the n2o was partially produced by nitrification in these estuaries the net isotope effects and expected range of Œ¥ 15nbulk and sp of n2o have been employed to interpret the bacterial and fungal denitrification as well as nitrification for the n2o production all the data measured for these estuaries fell between bacterial and fungal denitrification and nitrification indicating that denitrification and nitrification were responsible for the n2o emissions in these estuaries the fungal denitrification showed smaller effects on Œ¥ 15nbulk and sp of n2o in jj and jlj relative to other estuaries which may be attributed to that high n concentrations can inhibit fungal biomass and low c n 25 conditions are not favorable for fungal community activity moore et al 2020 4 4 indirect n2o emission factor across subtropical estuaries indirect n2o emission factors are highly variable with changing environmental factors and across different estuaries kroeze et al 2005 in this study the indirect n2o emission factors varied largely between 0 06 and 0 23 4 times higher but they did not differ significantly across the estuaries p 0 124 and between wet and dry seasons p 0 316 however the average indirect n2o emission factor throughout the four seasons was relatively higher in jx fig 7b the reason could be that water no3 contents were minimal in this estuary in terms of the high n estuaries of jj and jlj the indirect n2o emission factors were higher in jj than jlj likely due to that jj had higher n2o concentrations but lower no3 contents relative to jlj in addition the average indirect n2o emission factors were mostly consistent in mj 0 082 mlx 0 088 and jj 0 086 indicating that the three estuaries may have proportionable n2o production in response to the coincident no3 and further evidencing no3 dependence of water dissolved n2o concentrations murray et al 2015 the different seasonal variability of indirect n2o emission factors across these estuaries indicated that n2o emissions in low n estuaries can be favored in dry season while wet season may be more favorable for n2o emissions in high n estuaries likely due to that the high water flow can upwell the n2o from benthic to surface water turner et al 2016 wells et al 2018 the global estuarine n2o emissions could be overestimated since they ignore the decline of emission factors with increasing n concentrations and channel size hu et al 2016 wells et al 2018 and neglect the differences in emission factors corresponding to different n forms murray et al 2015 the global estuarine n2o emissions are extrapolated that n2o is emitted as a 1 of inorganic n including nh4 no3 and no2 entering in estuaries kroeze et al 2005 these estimates are based on assumption that all n2o is produced from the surface water inorganic n but they ignores estuary benthic environments that present large n2o emissions potential kroeze et al 2005 murray et al 2015 the ipcc default value of 0 25 is estimated based on the assumptions that n is only nitrified and denitrified as well as n2o production from the two processes ipcc 2006 the indirect n2o emission factor in these subtropical estuaries was on average 0 11 which was estimated as the ratio of dissolved n2on concentration to no3 n concentration if we used inorganic n the indirect n2o emission factor would be less than 0 11 the indirect n2o emission factor of this study was also lower than the ipcc default value 0 25 ipcc et al 2006 and global rivers 0 17 marzadri et al 2021 the global n2o emissions estimates of estuarine environments were in a range of 0 15 0 91 tg n2on yr 1 murray et al 2015 representing 1 2 7 3 of the global terrestrial n2o emissions averaging 12 5 tg n2o n yr 1 tian et al 2015 therefore although the indirect n2o emission factors vary slightly the estimates of n2o emissions through upscaling global estuaries based on these emission factors would be large uncertain 4 5 implication for estuarine n2o emissions n2o production processes are kinetically dependent on no3 substrate turner et al 2016 wang et al 2021 we therefore used the michaelis menten kinetics to present n2o concentrations saturations and fluxes in response to no3 concentrations fig 5 in subtropical watershed of southeast china the long time data and models project a 55 increase of no3 transported into estuaries by the year 2050 zhang and chen 2014 which would increase n2o emissions from these estuaries by 31 17 48 based on the relationship in fig 5 conversely a regression model estimates that a 30 decline of net anthropogenic nitrogen inputs from the watershed can decrease no3 export by 21 into estuaries zhang and chen 2014 in light of this dissolved n2o concentrations in the studied estuaries would be decreased by 13 7 19 implying a substantial reduction in n2o emissions from these estuaries however n2o production processes are influenced by secondary factors turner et al 2016 for instance an increase in water turbidity stimulating nitrifying bacteria would enhance nitrification that can yield both n2o and no3 xia et al 2017 and therefore these projections likely represent a lower estimate in wet season in addition above extrapolation of n2o emissions under the n changes may be underestimated because n concentrations from waste water treatment plant have not been mentioned in addition in terms of warming potential and co2 balance of estuarine environments the areal emissions of estuary n2o in co2 equiv in this study could offset 4 9 of average co2 sink of china estuaries 32 49 mg co2 m 2 h 1 estimated by the invest model yi 2017 these results suggest that estuaries are positive contributors to climate warming and highlight the urgency of controlled estuarine n2o emissions it has been reported that n2o emissions are mainly controlled by n p stoichiometry not the c availability in the highly impacted estuaries wells et al 2018 the high n p ratios in the high n estuaries reflected the possibility that n enrichments on biologic growth could be increasing n2o production by favoring the microbial n cycling rather than the n assimilatory growth in addition nutrient substrate could amplify estuarine ecological consequences like decline of dissolved oxygen combined with high n concentrations which would many fold produce n2o the low n2o emissions observed in the estuary with large discharge and water flow indicated that the large remaining n could be directly transported into estuarine and coastal zones potentially exacerbating eutrophication and hypoxia the eutrophic and hypoxic estuaries in return face the functioning degradation from n retainer to reactors and even pipes wells et al 2018 wells and eyre 2019 therefore estuarine and coastal n2o emissions would be intensified and highly variable under the contexts of increased n conditions and hydrologic changes 5 conclusions in this study water dissolved n2o concentrations were lower in the estuaries characterized by large discharge and water flow even though they presented high n concentrations but despite n2o saturations and fluxes varied significantly across the estuaries and were higher in the estuaries with high n concentrations dissolved n2o concentrations were also strongly and significantly determined directly by water n and do concentrations and more indirectly by water temperature and velocity the low n2o fluxes but high sp of n2o indicated that complete denitrification was responsible for the decline of n2o emissions indirect n2o emission factors from these estuaries were lower than the ipcc default value indicating the decline of indirect n2o emission factor with the increasing water n concentrations average n2o emissions in co2 equiv estimated in this study could offset 4 9 of average co2 sink of china estuaries these results suggest that hydrologic conditions and n concentrations codetermine the dynamics of estuary n2o emissions and that subtropical estuaries are critical for n2o emission

16259,antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args as emerging pollutants are released into environment increasing the risk of horizontal gene transfer hgt however a limited number of studies quantified the effects of arb disinfection on the hgt risk this study investigated the inactivation of e coli 10667 sul and the release and removal of args using an electrochemical flow through reactor eftr furthermore the transfer frequencies and potential mechanisms of hgt after disinfection were explored using non resistant e coli gmcc 13373 as the recipient and e coli dh5Œ± carrying plasmid rp4 as the donor a threshold of current density 0 25 ma cm2 was observed to destroy cells and release intracellular args iargs to increase extracellular args eargs concentration the further increase in the current density to 1 ma cm2 resulted in the decline of eargs concentration due to the higher degradation rate of eargs than the release rate of iargs the performance of args degradation and hgt frequency by eftr were compared with those of conventional disinfection processes including chlorination and ultraviolet radiation uv a higher args degradation 83 46 was observed by eftr compared with that under chlorination 10 23 and uv 27 07 accordingly eftr reduced the hgt frequency 0 69 of released args into the recipient forward transfer and the value was lower than that by chlorination 2 69 and uv 1 73 meanwhile the surviving injured e coli 10667 sul with increased cell permeability was transferred by plasmid rp4 from the donor reverse transfer with a higher frequency of 0 33 by eftr compared with that under chlorination 0 26 and uv 0 16 in addition the sul3 gene was the least resistant to eftr than sul1 and sul2 gene these findings provide important insights into the mechanism of hgt between the injured e coli 10667 sul and environmental bacteria eftr is a promising disinfection technology for preventing the spread of antibiotic resistance

eftr 1 introduction antibiotic resistance ar has become a global crisis that threatens public health and pollutes the ecological environment due to the extensive abuse of antibiotics in various fields including animal husbandry aquatic products and clinical medicine yu et al 2017 li et al 2015 h n li et al 2020 hou et al 2021a wastewater is a tremendous reservoir of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args rozman et al 2020 paulus et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 it is predicted that ar will result in the occurrence of more difficult to treat diseases and millions of premature deaths by 2050 if no action is implemented immediately ahmed et al 2020 jin et al 2018 disinfection is indispensable to reduce ar and control the number of arb in water ahmed et al 2020 conventional disinfection technologies including ultraviolet radiation uv chlorination and ozone have been widely used to ensure the safety of water quality however the destruction of arb and args still needs to be considered the arb inactivated by uv easily show photoreactivation in the absence of a residual disinfectant destiani and templeton 2019 wang et al 2012 several studies reported the regrowth of the surviving cells after uv treatment alexander et al 2016 sousa et al 2017 chlorination and ozone are effective in inactivating arb but will release args and enrich the args levels in water which pose a potential risk to public health yuan et al 2015 sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 yu et al 2017 the reported enrichment of the args level means the destruction of total dna tdna which includes intracellular dna idna and extracellular dna edna the idna locates in the intact bacterial compartment whereas edna originates from the lysis of dead cells and active secretion from live bacterial cells calder√≥n franco et al 2020 zarei baygi and smith 2021 slipko et al 2019 once the edna that carries args is released into the environment other bacteria recipient will probably take up the naked edna by horizontal genes transfer hgt resulting in the spread of args between bacteria of the same or different genera inter species rodriguez beltran et al 2013 wang et al 2016 lu et al 2020 dodd 2012 furthermore some injured bacteria after disinfection show high cell membrane permeability and easily uptake released args or plasmids from sensitive donor and then transform them into arb however the contribution of the injured bacteria to genetic transformation during the treatment of disinfection remains unclear therefore an efficient and emerging technology is urgently needed to reduce the enrichment of args and control the pathways of arb and args transmission although some disinfection processes were reported to remove arb and args yu et al 2021 ding et al 2019 a limited number of research have determined the effect of arb disinfection on hgt specifically no comparison was performed on different processes electrochemical oxidation has been considered as an efficient and safe water disinfection technology due to its unique advantages including the ease of operation mild conditions and non requirement of chemical agent addition duan et al 2016 in our previous works the electrochemical flow through reactor eftr exhibited a higher removal efficiency of contaminants and a lower energy consumption than a flow by reactor due to the high mass transfer efficiency the between anode and cathode as well enhanced bulk solution reactions involving reactive oxygen species ros zhang et al 2021 y q zhang et al 2019 liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019b chen et al 2021 wang et al 2019 although eftr can significantly remove various contaminants few studies have determined its removal of arb and args in addition electrochemical oxidation can disrupt the cell membrane and release args by producing ros that change the permeability of cells meng et al 2019 ghasemian et al 2017 hydroxyl radicals oh as intermediates of o2 evolution from water electrolysis at the anode are non selective radical and cause a majority of bacterial inactivation in the electrochemical oxidation process panizza and cerisola 2009 the production of oh is dependent on current density which is a crucial factor during electrochemical oxidation however no research has been conducted on the effects of current density on the release and degradation of args in this study an eftr was developed to simultaneously remove arb and args the threshold of the current densities required for the release of args was investigated then the effects of operating parameters including flow velocity electrode distance and electrolyte concentration on the inactivation of e coli 10 667 sul and degradation of eargs and iargs were examined for the first time we quantified the hgt frequencies of the released args from e coli 10 667 sul into the recipient forward transfer and the surviving injured e coli 10 667 sul transferred by plasmid rp4 reverse transfer after different disinfection processes including eftr chlorination and uv finally the mechanism of hgt in eftr chlorination and uv was analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents all chemical reagents were

anhydrous sodium sulfate 0 1 mol l as the supporting electrolyte was constantly circulated and magnetically stirred throughout the system with an electrolysis time of 90 min the homogeneous solution was delivered using a peristaltic pump into the eftr at a certain flow velocity of 0 17 cm s first passing through the anode then through the cathode with an electrodes distance of 1 mm this batch test was a differential column batch reactor so the solution eventually back to a beaker in order to obtain the optimal removal conditions a series of tests was conducted to investigate the effects of different factors on removal performances under the same conditions including current densities flow velocities electrode distances and electrolyte concentrations for chlorination disinfection test sodium hypochlorite was added into 150 ml e coli bacterial suspension with a concentration of 108 cfu ml to establish chlorine concentration of 30 mg l with stirring continuously for uv disinfection

easily degraded in environment therefore the free edna is not discussed in this study yuan et al 2019 mao et al 2014 wang et al 2016 exactly 2 ml samples were filtered through a 0 22 Œºm filter membrane and the tdna was extracted from the filter membrane in accordance with the instructions of fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals ca the extraction method of tdna has been reported in

manufacturer s instructions for idna si text s6 mao et al 2014 dong et al 2019 hao et al 2019 the dna concentration was detected by a q5000 micro uv spectrophotometer quawell usa the purity indexes of dna were assessed by the ratio of absorbance at 260 and 280 nm if the ratio was in the range of 1 8 2 0 it indicated the high purity of dna all extracted dna was stored at 20 c to quantify the copy number of total args targs and iargs sul1 sul2 and sul3 by bio rad iq5 qualitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr bio rad company ca usa the detailed information of the primer for args sul1 sul2 and sul3 are shown in table s1 the qpcr reaction mixtures with a total volume of 25 ¬µl contained 9 5 ¬µl sterilized ultrapure water 1 0 ¬µl forward primer 1 0 ¬µl reverse primer 12 5 ¬µl tb green premix ex taqii takara and 1 0 ¬µl samples sterilized ultrapure water was used as control the qpcr amplification process was as follows 95 c for 30 s followed by 40 cycles of 95 c for 5 s and 30 s at the annealing temperature the melting curve was generated to verify specificity all reactions were conducted in triplicate finally the gene copies of samples were calculated based on the standard curves 2 8 hgt experiments the risks of hgt caused by the release of args into the environment after electrochemical treatment were evaluated fig 2 the e coli dh5Œ± with concentration of 108 cfu ml carrying rp4 plasmid which encodes high level resistance to tetracycline 16 mg l and non resistant e coli gmcc 13 373 with concentration of 109 cfu ml were selected to determine the interaction between the e coli 10 667 sul by disinfection treatment of 90 min the injured e coli 10 667 sul and environmental bacteria experiment 1 which was called forward transfer showed the effect of the injured e coli 10 667 sul on environmental bacteria conversely experiment 2 was called reverse transfer and displayed the effect of environmental bacteria on the injured e coli 10 667 sul a total of 2 ml treated e coli cicc 10 667 sul suspension was incubated in 100 ml nutrient broth with 2 ml e coli gmcc 13 373 suspension and 2 ml e coli dh5Œ± suspension at 37 c respectively the mixture was shaken at 160 rpm for 6 48 h until the stationary growth phase the untreated e coli cicc 10 667 sul suspension was used as control afterward the sample was washed and spread on the nutrient agar plate containing appropriate antibiotics on the one hand e coli gmcc 13 373 as the recipient strain was screened by using plates without antibiotics the donor and the sum of donor and transconjugant were screened by using plates containing 50 mg l sulfanilamide on the other hand for e coli dh5Œ± as the donor strain the recipient was screened by using plates containing 50 mg l sulfanilamide and the transconjugant was screened by using plates containing 50 mg l sulfanilamide and 16 mg l tetracycline for the chlorination and uv disinfection the risks of hgt were evaluated using the same experimental methods as electrochemical disinfection all experiments were performed in triplicate the frequency of horizontal transfer for forward transfer and reverse transfer were calculated by eq 3 and 4 guo and zhang 2017 guo and yuan 2015 3 frequency of horizontal transfer forward transfer c p 2 c p 1 cfu ml c p 3 cfu ml 4 frequency of horizontal transfer reverse transfer c p 5 cfu ml c p 4 cfu ml where cp1 cp2 cp3 cp4 and cp5 are the concentration of different sample on the different nutrient agar plate respectively 2 9 statistical analysis the concentration of dna and copy number of args were expressed as mean value standard deviation sd the significant difference of samples under different conditions was assessed by anova at the 95 confidence level the linear correlation between e coli 10 667 sul and args concentration was analyzed using spss 21 0 software the p values of p 0 05 and p 0 01 were considered as statistically significant and were designated as and respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 e coli 10 667 sul inactivation and oh generation in eftr the current density is a primary factor that affects the e coli 10 667 sul inactivation as it can regulate the oh production on the surface of electrode in eftr as shown in figs s2a and 3a the inactivation of e coli 10 667 sul occurred in accordance with the pseudo first order kinetic model hou et al 2021b the inactivation efficiency of e coli 10 667 sul increased from 0 50 logs to 7 72 logs and the observed rate constant increased from 0 012 min 1 to 1 982 min 1 when the current density increased from 0 05 ma cm2 to 12 5 ma cm2 after the electrolysis time of 90 min the analysis of linear regression for the rate constant with current density showed that the current density had a direct influence on the e coli 10 667 sul inactivation p 0 01 fig 3 b the result suggested that the inactivation of e coli 10 667 sul was mainly controlled by an electrochemical process furthermore the steady state concentration of oh and cell voltage at different current densities were explored fig 3c when the current density ranged from 0 ma cm2 to 0 25 ma cm2 the voltage was lower than the standard reduction potential e0 oh h2o 2 8 v vs she leading to non generation of oh and low inactivation efficiency of e coli 10 667 sul however when the current density exceeded 1 ma cm2 the voltage was higher than the redox potential of sulfate radicals e0 3 1 v vs nhe the o2 and so4 2 were activated to produce o2 and so4 respectively and further promoted the generation of oh in eftr li et al 2020b olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 cao et al 2019 therefore the current density demonstrated the threshold values of 0 25 ma cm2 and 1 ma cm2 for oh generation kolthoff and lingane 2002 sir√©s and brillas 2012 when the corresponding steady state concentration of oh increased from 7 72 10 13 mol s l to 5 75 10 10 mol s l with the increase in current density from 0 05 ma cm2 to 12 5 ma cm2 the idna concentration decreased up to 81 8 figs 3c and 3d which suggested that a high steady state concentration of oh caused considerable damage to the idna grebei et al 2010 meanwhile the idna concentration significantly decreased and the edna concentration increased first and then decreased as the current density increased and the peak of edna concentration appeared at 1 0 ma cm2 the results indicated that the applied current caused the release of idna into the environment in addition the further increase in the current density would destroy the structure of edna leading to a slight decrease in edna concentration fig 3d 3 2 release and removal of args in eftr given that the release of args in the form of edna caused environmental risks the release and removal characteristics of args in eftr must be studied as shown in fig 4 a the iargs and eargs concentrations were investigated as the current density increased no significant changes were observed in the iargs and eargs concentrations when the current density was lower than 0 25 ma cm2 inset image in fig 4a when the increase in current density reached values higher than 0 25 ma cm2 the concentrations of iargs sharply decreased whereas those of eargs remarkably increased accordingly the fractions of iargs and eargs fig 4b presented similar trends with the concentration curves fig 4a the main cause for these results was the corresponding voltage at 0 25 ma cm2 that is 2 8 v which can produce oh on the electrode surface then the oh destroyed the cell membrane of bacteria and lysed the cell leading to the increase in extracellular secretion with the further increase in the current density to 1 ma cm2 the eargs concentration significantly decreased because more eargs strands were attacked by oh to form fragments due to the higher degradation rate of eargs than the release rate of iargs h n li et al 2020 bruguera casamada et al 2017 fig 4c demonstrates the cell morphology at various current densities the untreated e coli 10 667 sul had an intact cell structure and a smooth membrane surface when the current density increased to 0 25 ma cm2 the cell structure of e coli 10 667 sul was damaged and the cell surface generated crack and holes the higher current density of 1 ma cm2 resulted in more damaged cells this study was the first to determine the effects of current density on the release and degradation of args from e coli 10 667 sul moreover these results showed that a higher current density was required to degrade args than that to cause damage of e coli 10 667 sul therefore decreasing bacterial viability to fulfill the demand to control the risk caused by e coli 10 667 sul is insufficient a considerably high energy should be utilized to break down args in the e coli 10 667 sul 3 3 oxidative stress response and cell membrane permeability in eftr the production of ros can destroy cell membrane and increase cell membrane permeability in eftr promoting the damage of dna numerous antioxidant enzymes including sod and cat are induced to protect bacteria from the oxidative damage caused by ros thus the sod and cat activities also play an important role in relieving oxidative stress fraud and poole 2011 fig 5 shows that the production of ros increased with the increase in current density compared with the untreated control and was significantly induced at the current density higher than 0 25 ma cm2 in addition the oxidative stress response was induced by the high production of ros the sod has a special physiological activity and can clean free radicals in living organisms compared with the control group no current density the sod activity increased dramatically up to 6 9 times at the current density of 0 15 ma cm2 with the further increase in the current density beyond 0 25 ma cm2 the sod activity decreased but was still about 4 2 times that of the control group similar to the sod activity the cat activity significantly improved and then declined with the increase in current density the cat activity was still about 1 81 times that of the control group these results suggested that the change trend of sod and cat activities was consistent with the production of ros given the substantial amount of ros was produced with the current density sod and cat were synthesized by the bacteria to clean ros the increase in the cell membrane permeability promoted the damage of bacteria and dna which was caused by the ros production therefore a close relationship exists between ros production and cell membrane permeability 3 4 effects of operating condition on the inactivation of e coli 10 667 sul and removal of args the effects of flow velocities electrode distances and electrolyte concentrations on e coli 10 667 sul inactivation and args concentration were investigated figs 6 a 6b and s3 presents that the inactivation efficiency of e coli 10 667 sul increased whereas the dna and args concentration decreased slightly with the increase in flow velocity the reason is that the increase in flow velocity improved the reynolds number from 2535 to 28 030 which in turn enhanced the mass transfer coefficient of the contact interface between electrodes and bulk solution jiao et al 2020 ren et al 2020 as shown in figs 6c and 6e the inactivation efficiency of e coli 10 667 sul decreased first and then increased with electrode distance whereas the change trend showed the opposite with the increase in electrolyte concentration these results were similar to the removal efficiency of dna and args because e coli 10 667 sul inactivation was caused by dna damage figs 6d 6f s4 and s5 the increase in electrode distance improved the internal resistance of the electrodes and cell voltage at a certain electrolyte concentration leading to a high energy consumption xie et al 2017 ni et al 2020 an increase in electrolyte concentration could improve the conductivity of solution accelerate the electron transfer and produce more oh thus promoting the removal of args li et al 2016 however extremely high levels of sulfate ions would produce persulfate which could scavenge oh and inhibit the removal of args wu et al 2020 when the electrolyte concentration was 0 1 mol l the eargs concentration was the lowest resulting in the lowest risk of hgt therefore the electrode distance of 1 mm and electrolyte concentration of 0 1 mol l were selected for further studies 3 5 potential assessment of args horizon transfer the removal performance of args and hgt frequency using different disinfection technologies including eftr chlorination and uv were compared as shown in fig 7 a significant differences were observed regarding the inactivation of e coli 10 667 sul and removal of targs among the three disinfection technologies the inactivation of e coli 10 667 sul by eftr and chlorination were close to each other achieving 5 98 logs and 5 43 logs respectively which were both higher than that by uv disinfection 2 11 logs however the removal efficiency of targs by eftr 83 46 was notably higher than that by chlorination 10 23 and uv 27 07 the reason was that the reaction rate of selective reactive chlorine species rcs such as cl to dna molecules k 0 0013 min 1 was lower than that of oh k 0 0202 min 1 fig s6a the removal efficiency of targs by uv disinfection was significantly lower than that by eftr because the sulfa arb had higher uv tolerance and targs are not broke down by uv zheng et al 2017 similar studies have reported that the inactivation efficiency of arb reached 4 8 5 5 logs at a uv dose of 600 j m2 whereas the removal efficiency of args was very low 0 1 0 logs stange et al 2019 previous studies showed that uv could result in the formation of a pyrimidine dimer further hindering the idna replication and transcription chang et al 2017 wang et al 2020 therefore the iargs fraction in uv is lower than that in eftr and the eargs fraction in uv is higher than that in eftr fig s6b sharma et al 2016 furthermore the results in figs 7b and 7c show that different genes exhibited diverse resistant abilities to disinfection and the sul3 gene was the weakest due to the more number of potential dimers in the sul3 gene particularly thymus pyrimidine tt dimers tt dimers affect the dna replication and transcription weaken the hydrogen bonding between double stranded idna molecules and inhibit dna synthesis destiani et al 2017 chang et al 2017 liu and hu 2020 pei et al 2006 fig 7d shows the horizontal transfer frequency of the samples after treatment by three disinfection technologies the frequency of released args from injured e coli 10 667 sul into the surrounding recipient forward transfer by eftr 0 69 was lower than that by chlorination 2 69 and uv 1 73 because eftr presented a higher removal efficiency of args fig 7a meanwhile the reverse transfer of plasmid rp4 from the surrounding bacteria to the surviving injured e coli 10 667 sul was also investigated the survival injured e coli 10 667 sul were transferred by plasmid rp4 with a higher frequency of 0 33 by eftr compared with chlorination 0 27 and uv 0 16 this result suggested that the lowest reverse transfer frequency of uv was likely due to the formation of thymine dimer in double stranded helix idna molecules under uv irradiation inhibiting idna replication and transcription the cell membrane permeability of the survival injured e coli 10 667 sul by the eftr disinfection was increased leading to the highest reverse transfer frequency augsburger et al 2019 destiani et al 2017 chang et al 2017 however it should be noted that the total frequency of horizontal transfer of samples after treatment using eftr was significantly lower than that of chlorination and uv in addition the power consumption of eftr 3 90 w l was lower than that of chlorination 3 99 w l and uv 4 07 w l the detailed calculation is shown in si text s7 overall the above results demonstrate that eftr is a promising water disinfection technology for gram negative bacteria in the environment to prevent the spread of ar however the spread of ar by eftr disinfection for other bacteria is still needed to be considered in the future study 3 6 mechanism of hgt in eftr chlorination and uv processes fig 8 shows the mechanisms of hgt in eftr chlorination and uv processes for eftr the production of ros was a crucial factor for accelerating horizontal transfer due to the applied current oxidation by oh was responsible for the damage of cell structure and ultimately led to cell death curtin et al 2002 simultaneously the iargs were released into the water environment and became a source for the spread of eargs the recipient bacteria took up the naked dna containing eargs and incorporated it into their own chromosome or converted it into an autonomous extra chromosomal replicon leading to the occurrence of forward transfer lorenz and wackernagel 1994 hall 2012 on the other hand reverse transfer is the contact between the donor carrying plasmid and recipient bacteria through a pilus or pores to form a channel that transfers the plasmid dna huddleston 2014 the plasmid is a covalently closed circular double stranded dna molecule that replicates independently and expresses the genetic information they carry in the cytoplasm zahid et al 2009 hocl can destroy the cell wall and membrane and then enter into the cytoplasm during chlorine disinfection uv can induce dna damage by penetrating a relatively transparent structure as cell wall instead of free radical generation therefore the frequency of reverse transfer for uv was extremely low compared with eftr and chlorination from the above results an interaction exists between the treated e coli 10 667 sul and surrounding bacteria the released args spread through the two mechanisms of hgt in environment 4 conclusion this study demonstrated that eftr exhibited a superior performance in the simultaneous removal of e coli 10 667 sul and args the removal efficiencies of e coli 10 667 sul and targs achieved 7 72 logs and 96 1 after 90 min at the current density of 12 5 ma cm2 respectively this finding was due to the destroyed cell membrane of bacteria caused by oh resulting in the dna damage the current density exhibited a marked influence on the release of intracellular args a threshold of current density 0 25 ma cm2 was observed to destroy cells and release iargs leading to the increased eargs concentration the further increase in the current density to 1 ma cm2 resulted in the decline of eargs concentrations due to the higher degradation rate of eargs than the release rate of iargs the performance of args degradation and hgt frequency by eftr were compared with those of conventional disinfection processes including chlorination and uv a higher args degradation 83 46 was observed with eftr compared with chlorination 10 23 and uv 27 07 accordingly eftr reduced the hgt frequency 0 69 of the released args into the recipient forward transfer and the value was lower than that obtained by chlorination 2 69 and uv 1 73 meanwhile the surviving injured e coli 10 667 sul with increased cell permeability were transferred by plasmid rp4 from the donor reverse transfer with a higher frequency of 0 33 by eftr compared with chlorination 0 27 and uv 0 16 furthermore the mechanisms of e coli 10 667 sul inactivation and dna damage for different technologies were analyzed in conclusion eftr is a promising technology for water disinfection to prevent the spread of ar declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no conflict of

16259,antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args as emerging pollutants are released into environment increasing the risk of horizontal gene transfer hgt however a limited number of studies quantified the effects of arb disinfection on the hgt risk this study investigated the inactivation of e coli 10667 sul and the release and removal of args using an electrochemical flow through reactor eftr furthermore the transfer frequencies and potential mechanisms of hgt after disinfection were explored using non resistant e coli gmcc 13373 as the recipient and e coli dh5Œ± carrying plasmid rp4 as the donor a threshold of current density 0 25 ma cm2 was observed to destroy cells and release intracellular args iargs to increase extracellular args eargs concentration the further increase in the current density to 1 ma cm2 resulted in the decline of eargs concentration due to the higher degradation rate of eargs than the release rate of iargs the performance of args degradation and hgt frequency by eftr were compared with those of conventional disinfection processes including chlorination and ultraviolet radiation uv a higher args degradation 83 46 was observed by eftr compared with that under chlorination 10 23 and uv 27 07 accordingly eftr reduced the hgt frequency 0 69 of released args into the recipient forward transfer and the value was lower than that by chlorination 2 69 and uv 1 73 meanwhile the surviving injured e coli 10667 sul with increased cell permeability was transferred by plasmid rp4 from the donor reverse transfer with a higher frequency of 0 33 by eftr compared with that under chlorination 0 26 and uv 0 16 in addition the sul3 gene was the least resistant to eftr than sul1 and sul2 gene these findings provide important insights into the mechanism of hgt between the injured e coli 10667 sul and environmental bacteria eftr is a promising disinfection technology for preventing the spread of antibiotic resistance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic resistant bacteria arb antibiotic resistance genes args horizontal gene transfer hgt disinfection electrochemical flow through reactor eftr 1 introduction antibiotic resistance ar has become a global crisis that threatens public health and pollutes the ecological environment due to the extensive abuse of antibiotics in various fields including animal husbandry aquatic products and clinical medicine yu et al 2017 li et al 2015 h n li et al 2020 hou et al 2021a wastewater is a tremendous reservoir of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args rozman et al 2020 paulus et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 it is predicted that ar will result in the occurrence of more difficult to treat diseases and millions of premature deaths by 2050 if no action is implemented immediately ahmed et al 2020 jin et al 2018 disinfection is indispensable to reduce ar and control the number of arb in water ahmed et al 2020 conventional disinfection technologies including ultraviolet radiation uv chlorination and ozone have been widely used to ensure the safety of water quality however the destruction of arb and args still needs to be considered the arb inactivated by uv easily show photoreactivation in the absence of a residual disinfectant destiani and templeton 2019 wang et al 2012 several studies reported the regrowth of the surviving cells after uv treatment alexander et al 2016 sousa et al 2017 chlorination and ozone are effective in inactivating arb but will release args and enrich the args levels in water which pose a potential risk to public health yuan et al 2015 sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 yu et al 2017 the reported enrichment of the args level means the destruction of total dna tdna which includes intracellular dna idna and extracellular dna edna the idna locates in the intact bacterial compartment whereas edna originates from the lysis of dead cells and active secretion from live bacterial cells calder√≥n franco et al 2020 zarei baygi and smith 2021 slipko et al 2019 once the edna that carries args is released into the environment other bacteria recipient will probably take up the naked edna by horizontal genes transfer hgt resulting in the spread of args between bacteria of the same or different genera inter species rodriguez beltran et al 2013 wang et al 2016 lu et al 2020 dodd 2012 furthermore some injured bacteria after disinfection show high cell membrane permeability and easily uptake released args or plasmids from sensitive donor and then transform them into arb however the contribution of the injured bacteria to genetic transformation during the treatment of disinfection remains unclear therefore an efficient and emerging technology is urgently needed to reduce the enrichment of args and control the pathways of arb and args transmission although some disinfection processes were reported to remove arb and args yu et al 2021 ding et al 2019 a limited number of research have determined the effect of arb disinfection on hgt specifically no comparison was performed on different processes electrochemical oxidation has been considered as an efficient and safe water disinfection technology due to its unique advantages including the ease of operation mild conditions and non requirement of chemical agent addition duan et al 2016 in our previous works the electrochemical flow through reactor eftr exhibited a higher removal efficiency of contaminants and a lower energy consumption than a flow by reactor due to the high mass transfer efficiency the between anode and cathode as well enhanced bulk solution reactions involving reactive oxygen species ros zhang et al 2021 y q zhang et al 2019 liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019b chen et al 2021 wang et al 2019 although eftr can significantly remove various contaminants few studies have determined its removal of arb and args in addition electrochemical oxidation can disrupt the cell membrane and release args by producing ros that change the permeability of cells meng et al 2019 ghasemian et al 2017 hydroxyl radicals oh as intermediates of o2 evolution from water electrolysis at the anode are non selective radical and cause a majority of bacterial inactivation in the electrochemical oxidation process panizza and cerisola 2009 the production of oh is dependent on current density which is a crucial factor during electrochemical oxidation however no research has been conducted on the effects of current density on the release and degradation of args in this study an eftr was developed to simultaneously remove arb and args the threshold of the current densities required for the release of args was investigated then the effects of operating parameters including flow velocity electrode distance and electrolyte concentration on the inactivation of e coli 10 667 sul and degradation of eargs and iargs were examined for the first time we quantified the hgt frequencies of the released args from e coli 10 667 sul into the recipient forward transfer and the surviving injured e coli 10 667 sul transferred by plasmid rp4 reverse transfer after different disinfection processes including eftr chlorination and uv finally the mechanism of hgt in eftr chlorination and uv was analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents all chemical reagents were analytical grade and kits of higher purity were purchased from various commercial suppliers more details are shown in text s1 of supporting information si ultrapure water with a resistivity 18 2 mœâ cm milli q purification system was used to prepare all solutions 2 2 bacterial strains and culture conditions escherichia coli e coli cicc 10 667 which shows a high level resistance to sulfanilamide sul1 sul2 and sul3 50 mg l was selected as the target arb because e coli is a kind of common gram negative bacteria in nature with simple culture conditions easy operation strong and fast propagation

7 2 at 37 c by shaking at 160 rpm for 16 24 h until the stationary growth phase guo et al 2013 the bacterial strains were collected by centrifuging at 10 000 rpm for 10 min at 4 c the cells were washed thrice with a sterilized saline solution nacl 0 9 and resuspended in sterilized ultrapure water to obtain a bacterial suspension with a concentration of about 108 cfu ml colony forming unit ml 2 3 disinfection tests electrochemical oxidation tests were conducted using the eftr at room temperature fig 1 the porous ti enta sno2 sb 5 cm 5 cm described in our previous work was used as the anode chen et al 2019 placed in parallel with a stainless steel plate as cathode and connected using a dc regulated power supply the current density was 7 5 ma cm2 on the basis of the facial area of the anode 20 cm2 the interspace surface area and porosity of anode were 0 012 m2 g and 0 33 respectively a total of 150 ml e coli bacterial suspension with a concentration of 108 cfu ml containing anhydrous sodium sulfate 0 1 mol l as the supporting electrolyte was constantly circulated and magnetically stirred throughout the system with an electrolysis time of 90 min the homogeneous solution was delivered using a peristaltic pump into the eftr at a certain flow velocity of 0 17 cm s first passing through the anode then through the cathode with an electrodes distance of 1 mm this batch test was a differential column batch reactor so the solution eventually back to a beaker in order to obtain the optimal removal conditions a series of tests was conducted to investigate the effects of different factors on removal performances under the same conditions including current densities flow velocities electrode distances and electrolyte concentrations for chlorination disinfection test sodium hypochlorite was added into 150 ml e coli bacterial suspension with a concentration of 108 cfu ml to establish chlorine concentration of 30 mg l with stirring continuously for uv disinfection test 150 ml e coli bacterial suspension with the same concentration was magnetically stirred in the dark then a low pressure uv lamp 23 w with emission primarily at 254 nm was parallelly placed above the bacterial suspension to expose uv fluence of 250 mj cm2 in all disinfection tests 2 ml of samples was collected at certain time for 0 10 30 60 and 90 min respectively and stored at 4 c for subsequent analysis all disinfection tests were repeated three times and samples were collected in triplicate 2 4 analytical methods the inactivation performance of e coli 10 667 sul was assessed by measuring the number of bacteria in a sterile environment the samples were spread on nutrient agar plates by gradient dilution finally the number of colonies on the plates were counted after incubation at 37 c for 24 h the cell surface morphology of samples was observed by scanning electron microscope sem merlin compact zeiss germany after pretreatment shown in si text s2 the observed

diacetate dcfda cellular ros detection assay kit abcam uk and the cell membrane permeability was tested using the propidium iodide dye pi with the concentration of 1 mg ml life technologies usa both were quantified by the cytoflex flow cytometer beckman coulter usa at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 525 nm in addition oxidative stress indexes including superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat were detected strictly using the kit from the nanjing jiancheng bioengineering institute and a uv spectrophotometer all measurements were performed in accordance with the manufacturer s instructions and in triplicates the details are shown in si text s4 2 6 detection of oh steady state concentration to determine the main oh formed during electrochemical oxidation

easily degraded in environment therefore the free edna is not discussed in this study yuan et al 2019 mao et al 2014 wang et al 2016 exactly 2 ml samples were filtered through a 0 22 Œºm filter membrane and the tdna was extracted from the filter membrane in accordance with the instructions of fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals ca the extraction method of tdna has been reported in previous research zheng et al 2017 h n li et al 2020 wang et al 2020 a total of 2 ml samples was pretreated and purified using dneasy power water kit qiagen gmbh hilden germany following the manufacturer s instructions for idna si text s6 mao et al 2014 dong et al 2019 hao et al 2019 the dna concentration was detected by a q5000 micro uv spectrophotometer quawell usa the purity indexes of dna were assessed by the ratio of absorbance at 260 and 280 nm if the ratio was in the range of 1 8 2 0 it indicated the high purity of dna all extracted dna was stored at 20 c to quantify the copy number of total args targs and iargs sul1 sul2 and sul3 by bio rad iq5 qualitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr bio rad company ca usa the detailed information of the primer for args sul1 sul2 and

ex taqii takara and 1 0 ¬µl samples sterilized ultrapure water was used as control the qpcr amplification process was as follows 95 c for 30 s followed by 40 cycles of 95 c for 5 s and 30 s at the annealing temperature the melting curve was generated to verify specificity all reactions were conducted in triplicate finally the gene copies of samples were calculated based on the standard curves 2 8 hgt experiments the risks of hgt caused by the release of args into the environment after electrochemical treatment were evaluated fig 2 the e coli dh5Œ± with concentration of 108 cfu ml carrying rp4 plasmid which encodes high level resistance to tetracycline 16 mg l and non resistant e coli gmcc 13 373 with concentration of 109 cfu ml were selected to determine the interaction between the e coli 10 667 sul by disinfection treatment of 90 min the injured e coli 10 667 sul and environmental bacteria experiment 1 which was called forward transfer showed the effect of the injured e coli 10 667 sul on environmental bacteria conversely experiment 2 was called reverse transfer and displayed the effect of environmental bacteria on the injured e coli 10 667 sul a total of 2 ml treated e coli cicc 10 667 sul suspension was incubated in 100 ml nutrient broth with 2 ml e coli gmcc 13 373 suspension and 2 ml e coli dh5Œ± suspension at 37 c respectively the mixture was shaken at 160 rpm for 6 48 h until the stationary growth phase the untreated e coli cicc 10 667 sul suspension was used as control afterward the sample was washed and spread on the nutrient agar plate containing appropriate antibiotics on the one hand e coli gmcc 13 373 as the recipient strain was screened by using plates without antibiotics the donor and the sum of donor and transconjugant were screened by using plates containing 50 mg l sulfanilamide on the other hand for e coli dh5Œ± as the donor strain the recipient was screened by using plates containing 50 mg l sulfanilamide and the transconjugant was screened by using plates containing 50 mg l sulfanilamide and 16 mg l tetracycline for the chlorination and uv disinfection the risks of hgt were evaluated using the same experimental methods as electrochemical disinfection all experiments were performed in triplicate the frequency of horizontal transfer for forward transfer and reverse transfer were calculated by eq 3 and 4 guo and zhang 2017 guo and yuan 2015 3 frequency of horizontal transfer forward transfer c p 2 c p 1 cfu ml c p 3 cfu ml 4 frequency of horizontal transfer reverse transfer c p 5 cfu ml c p 4 cfu ml where cp1 cp2 cp3 cp4 and cp5 are the concentration of different sample on the different nutrient agar plate respectively 2 9 statistical analysis the concentration of dna and copy number of args were expressed as mean value standard deviation sd the significant difference of samples under different conditions was assessed by anova at the 95 confidence level the linear correlation between e coli 10 667 sul and args concentration was analyzed using spss 21 0 software the p values of p 0 05 and p 0 01 were considered as statistically significant and were designated as and respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 e coli 10 667 sul inactivation and oh generation in eftr the current density is a primary factor that affects the e coli 10 667 sul inactivation as it can regulate the oh production on the surface of electrode in eftr as shown in figs s2a and 3a the inactivation of e coli 10 667 sul occurred in accordance with the pseudo first order kinetic model hou et al 2021b the inactivation efficiency of e coli 10 667 sul increased from 0 50 logs to 7 72 logs and the observed rate constant increased from 0 012 min 1 to 1 982 min 1 when the current density increased from 0 05 ma cm2 to 12 5 ma cm2 after the electrolysis time of 90 min the analysis of linear regression for the rate constant with current density showed that the current density had a direct influence on the e coli 10 667 sul inactivation p 0 01 fig 3 b the result suggested that the inactivation of e coli 10 667 sul was mainly controlled by an electrochemical process furthermore the steady state concentration of oh and cell voltage at different current densities were explored fig 3c when the current density ranged from 0 ma cm2 to 0 25 ma cm2 the voltage was lower than the standard reduction potential e0 oh h2o 2 8 v vs she leading to non generation of oh and low inactivation efficiency of e coli 10 667 sul however when the current density exceeded 1 ma cm2 the voltage was higher than the redox potential of sulfate radicals e0 3 1 v vs nhe the o2 and so4 2 were activated to produce o2 and so4 respectively and further promoted the generation of oh in eftr li et al 2020b olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 cao et al 2019 therefore the current density demonstrated the threshold values of 0 25 ma cm2 and 1 ma cm2 for oh generation kolthoff and lingane 2002 sir√©s and brillas 2012 when the corresponding steady state concentration of oh increased from 7 72 10 13 mol s l to 5 75 10 10 mol s l with the increase in current density from 0 05 ma cm2 to 12 5 ma cm2 the idna concentration decreased up to 81 8 figs 3c and 3d which suggested that a high steady state concentration of oh caused considerable damage to the idna grebei et al 2010 meanwhile the idna concentration significantly decreased and the edna concentration increased first and then decreased as the current density increased and the peak of edna concentration appeared at 1 0 ma cm2 the results indicated that the applied current caused the release of idna into the environment in addition the further increase in the current density would destroy the structure of edna leading to a slight decrease in edna concentration fig 3d 3 2 release and removal of args in eftr given that the release of args in the form of edna caused environmental risks the release and removal characteristics of args in eftr must be studied as shown in fig 4 a the iargs and eargs concentrations were investigated as the current density increased no significant changes were observed in the iargs and eargs concentrations when the current density was lower than 0 25 ma cm2 inset image in fig 4a when the increase in current density reached values higher than 0 25 ma cm2 the concentrations of iargs sharply decreased whereas those of eargs remarkably increased accordingly the fractions of iargs and eargs fig 4b presented similar trends with the concentration curves fig 4a the main cause for these results was the corresponding voltage at 0 25 ma cm2 that is 2 8 v which can produce oh on the electrode surface then the oh destroyed the cell membrane of bacteria and lysed the cell leading to the increase in extracellular secretion with the further increase in the current density to 1 ma cm2 the eargs concentration significantly decreased because more eargs strands were attacked by oh to form fragments due to the higher degradation rate of eargs than the release rate of iargs h n li et al 2020 bruguera casamada et al 2017 fig 4c demonstrates the cell morphology at various current densities the untreated e coli 10 667 sul had an intact cell structure and a smooth membrane surface when the current density increased to 0 25 ma cm2 the cell structure of e coli 10 667 sul was damaged and the cell surface generated crack and holes the higher current density of 1 ma cm2 resulted in more damaged cells this study was the first to determine the effects of current density on the release and degradation of args from e coli 10 667 sul moreover these results showed that a higher current density was required to degrade args than that to cause damage of e coli 10 667 sul therefore decreasing bacterial viability to fulfill the demand to control the risk caused by e coli 10 667 sul is insufficient a considerably high energy should be utilized to break down args in the e coli 10 667 sul 3 3 oxidative stress response and cell membrane permeability in eftr the production of ros can destroy cell membrane and increase cell membrane permeability in eftr promoting the damage of dna numerous antioxidant enzymes including sod and cat are induced to protect bacteria from the oxidative damage caused by ros thus the sod and cat activities also play an important role in relieving oxidative stress fraud and poole 2011 fig 5 shows that the production of ros increased with the increase in current density compared with the untreated control and was significantly induced at the current density higher than 0 25 ma cm2 in addition the oxidative stress response was induced by the high production of ros the sod has a special physiological activity and can clean free radicals in living organisms compared with the control group no current density the sod activity increased dramatically up to 6 9 times at the current density of 0 15 ma cm2 with the further increase in the current density beyond 0 25 ma cm2 the sod activity decreased but was still about 4 2 times that of the control group similar to the sod activity the cat activity significantly improved and then declined with the increase in current density the cat activity was still about 1 81 times that of the control group these results suggested that the change trend of sod and cat activities was consistent with the production of ros given the substantial amount of ros was produced with the current density sod and cat were synthesized by the bacteria to clean ros the increase in the cell membrane permeability promoted the damage of bacteria and dna which was caused by the ros production therefore a close relationship exists between ros production and cell membrane permeability 3 4 effects of operating condition on the inactivation of e coli 10 667 sul and removal of args the effects of flow velocities electrode distances and electrolyte concentrations on e coli 10 667 sul inactivation and args concentration were investigated figs 6 a 6b and s3 presents that the inactivation efficiency of e coli 10 667 sul increased whereas the dna and args concentration decreased slightly with the increase in flow velocity the reason is that the increase in flow velocity improved the reynolds number from 2535 to 28 030 which in turn enhanced the mass transfer coefficient of the contact interface between electrodes and bulk solution jiao et al 2020 ren et al 2020 as shown in figs 6c and 6e the inactivation efficiency of e coli 10 667 sul decreased first and then increased with electrode distance whereas the change trend showed the opposite with the increase in electrolyte concentration these results were similar to the removal efficiency of dna and args because e coli 10 667 sul inactivation was caused by dna damage figs 6d 6f s4 and s5 the increase in electrode distance improved the internal resistance of the electrodes and cell voltage at a certain electrolyte concentration leading to a high energy consumption xie et al 2017 ni et al 2020 an increase in electrolyte concentration could improve the conductivity of solution accelerate the electron transfer and produce more oh thus promoting the removal of args li et al 2016 however extremely high levels of sulfate ions would produce persulfate which could scavenge oh and inhibit the removal of args wu et al 2020 when the electrolyte concentration was 0 1 mol l the eargs concentration was the lowest resulting in the lowest risk of hgt therefore the electrode distance of 1 mm and electrolyte concentration of 0 1 mol l were selected for further studies 3 5 potential assessment of args horizon transfer the removal performance of args and hgt frequency using different disinfection technologies including eftr chlorination and uv were compared as shown in fig 7 a significant differences were observed regarding the inactivation of e coli 10 667 sul and removal of targs among the three disinfection technologies the inactivation of e coli 10 667 sul by eftr and chlorination were close to each other achieving 5 98 logs and 5 43 logs respectively which were both higher than that by uv disinfection 2 11 logs however the removal efficiency of targs by eftr 83 46 was notably higher than that by chlorination 10 23 and uv 27 07 the reason was that the reaction rate of selective reactive chlorine species rcs such as cl to dna molecules k 0 0013 min 1 was lower than that of oh k 0 0202 min 1 fig s6a the removal efficiency of targs by uv disinfection was significantly lower than that by eftr because the sulfa arb had higher uv tolerance and targs are not broke down by uv zheng et al 2017 similar studies have reported that the inactivation efficiency of arb reached 4 8 5 5 logs at a uv dose of 600 j m2 whereas the removal efficiency of args was very low 0 1 0 logs stange et al 2019 previous studies showed that uv could result in the formation of a pyrimidine dimer further hindering the idna replication and transcription chang et al 2017 wang et al 2020 therefore the iargs fraction in uv is lower than that in eftr and the eargs fraction in uv is higher than that in eftr fig s6b sharma et al 2016 furthermore the results in figs 7b and 7c show that different genes exhibited diverse resistant abilities to disinfection and the sul3 gene was the weakest due to the more number of potential dimers in the sul3 gene particularly thymus pyrimidine tt dimers tt dimers affect the dna replication and transcription weaken the hydrogen bonding between double stranded idna molecules and inhibit dna synthesis destiani et al 2017 chang et al 2017 liu and hu 2020 pei et al 2006 fig 7d shows the horizontal transfer frequency of the samples after treatment by three disinfection technologies the frequency of released args from injured e coli 10 667 sul into the surrounding recipient forward transfer by eftr 0 69 was lower than that by chlorination 2 69 and uv 1 73 because eftr presented a higher removal efficiency of args fig 7a meanwhile the reverse transfer of plasmid rp4 from the surrounding bacteria to the surviving injured e coli 10 667 sul was also investigated the survival injured e coli 10 667 sul were transferred by plasmid rp4 with a higher frequency of 0 33 by eftr compared with chlorination 0 27 and uv 0 16 this result suggested that the lowest reverse transfer frequency of uv was likely due to the formation of thymine dimer in double stranded helix idna molecules under uv irradiation inhibiting idna replication and transcription the cell membrane permeability of the survival injured e coli 10 667 sul by the eftr disinfection was increased leading to the highest reverse transfer frequency augsburger et al 2019 destiani et al 2017 chang et al 2017 however it should be noted that the total frequency of horizontal transfer of samples after treatment using eftr was significantly lower than that of chlorination and uv in addition the power consumption of eftr 3 90 w l was lower than that of chlorination 3 99 w l and uv 4 07 w l the detailed calculation is shown in si text s7 overall the above results demonstrate that eftr is a promising water disinfection technology for gram negative bacteria in the environment to prevent the spread of ar however the spread of ar by eftr disinfection for other bacteria is still needed to be considered in the future study 3 6 mechanism of hgt in eftr chlorination and uv processes fig 8 shows the mechanisms of hgt in eftr chlorination and uv processes for eftr the production of ros was a crucial factor for accelerating horizontal transfer due to the applied current oxidation by oh was responsible for the damage of cell structure and ultimately led to cell death curtin et al 2002 simultaneously the iargs were released into the water environment and became a source for the spread of eargs the recipient bacteria took up the naked dna containing eargs and incorporated it into their own chromosome or converted it into an autonomous extra chromosomal replicon leading to the occurrence of forward transfer lorenz and wackernagel 1994 hall 2012 on the other hand reverse transfer is the contact between the donor carrying plasmid and recipient bacteria through a pilus or pores to form a channel that transfers the plasmid dna huddleston 2014 the plasmid is a covalently closed circular double stranded dna molecule that replicates independently and expresses the genetic information they carry in the cytoplasm zahid et al 2009 hocl can destroy the cell wall and membrane and then enter into the cytoplasm during chlorine disinfection uv can induce dna damage by penetrating a relatively transparent structure as cell wall instead of free radical generation therefore the frequency of reverse transfer for uv was extremely low compared with eftr and chlorination from the above results an interaction exists between the treated e coli 10 667 sul and surrounding bacteria the released args spread through the two mechanisms of hgt in environment 4 conclusion this study demonstrated that eftr exhibited a superior performance in the simultaneous removal of e coli 10 667 sul and args the removal efficiencies of e coli 10 667 sul and targs achieved 7 72 logs and 96 1 after 90 min at the current density of 12 5 ma cm2 respectively this finding was due to the destroyed cell membrane of bacteria caused by oh resulting in the dna damage the current density exhibited a marked influence on the release of intracellular args a threshold of current density 0 25 ma cm2 was observed to destroy cells and release iargs leading to the increased eargs concentration the further increase in the current density to 1 ma cm2 resulted in the decline of eargs concentrations due to the higher degradation rate of eargs than the release rate of iargs the performance of args degradation and hgt frequency by eftr were compared with those of conventional disinfection processes including chlorination and uv a higher args degradation 83 46 was observed with eftr compared with chlorination 10 23 and uv 27 07 accordingly eftr reduced the hgt frequency 0 69 of the released args into the recipient forward transfer and the value was lower than that obtained by chlorination 2 69 and uv 1 73 meanwhile the surviving injured e coli 10 667 sul with increased cell permeability were transferred by plasmid rp4 from the donor reverse transfer with a higher frequency of 0 33 by eftr compared with chlorination 0 27 and uv 0 16 furthermore the mechanisms of e coli 10 667 sul inactivation and dna damage for different technologies were analyzed in conclusion eftr is a promising technology for water disinfection to prevent the spread of ar declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no conflict of
