20210,many external sources of excitation can interfere with the performance of drones such as propeller or flapping motion this work investigates the effects external excitation plays on the nonlinear system s dynamics of gannet inspired drones using euler bernoulli beam theory the partial differential equations of motion are solved following the hamilton s principle galerkin discretization is then applied to convert the equations of motion to ordinary differential equations in which to obtain an approximation for the nonlinear dynamic response before buckling occurs the model is inspired by the gannet bird where the head is simplified to a cone shape the neck is resembled by a soft beam and the rest of the body is represented by a stiff thicker beam to suggest a buckling behavior physical for the diving bird if buckling is to occur the results observe the direct effects the external forcing the damping the impact velocity and the boundary conditions have on the resonant frequency range and deflection the results estimate that increasing the forcing amplitude will in turn amplify the hardening behavior and the maximum displacement to maintain a lower forcing amplitude consistent with a reasonable external acceleration a smaller drone mass should be employed it is observed that higher damping should be applied to minimize the drone s nonlinear effects the speed at which the drone impacts the water should be chosen to be lower than the estimated buckling speed to avoid lower natural frequencies and to reduce the hysteresis region in order to minimize the nonlinear behavior from the boundary conditions explored stiffer boundary conditions should be employed to increase the buckling speed and reduce the deflection when entering water keywords bioinspiration segmented beams dynamic analysis euler bernoulli beam theory galerkin discretization nonlinear analysis 1 introduction marine drones able to fly dive swim and exit water can increase the physical range of mission performance from air near the water s surface to under the water drones are used to eliminate the need for direct human involvement which may allow ease with performing surveillance and observation for military civilian and environmental applications shahid et al 2019 siddall and kovač 2014 yang et al 2015 hassanalian and abdelkefi 2017 salazar et al 2018 2019 murphy et al 2008 smaller sized drones could also allow for entry into small spaces however design of a drone includes machine components that create their own source of vibrations such as an actuator used for wing swept back to aid in smooth water entry wing flapping to provide movement between mediums or wing extension to help control lift these external vibrations can lead to issues with undesired resonances potentially affecting the resulting performance of the drone if the speed of the actuator and the drone are not carefully selected this study is interested in incorporating an external source of excitation to better understand the influence between excitation and the drone s inherent nonlinear dynamics and performance investigation on the nonlinear frequency response has been analyzed for single beams to compare experimental measures with discretization and direct techniques by lacarbonara et al 1998 and to explore using higher modes for approximation by emam and nayfeh 2004 nonlinear frequency responses have also been performed for single hinged hinged microbeams by ghayesh et al 2013 for cantilever carbon nanotube beams by talò et al 2020 and for continuous carbon nanotube beams intended for mass sensing applications by ali akbari et al 2019 and ghaffari et al 2020 for this current study a discretization technique using the galerkin approach is considered to transform the nonlinear partial differential equations of motion pde formulated from the extended hamilton s principle to an ordinary differential equation ode in order to estimate the nonlinear response activated from external vibration the drone models are inspired by the gannet bird because of their efficient performance with diving into water to catch prey raubenhelmer 2013 bhar et al 2019 ropert coudert et al 2004 at the point of impact when the head is underwater and the rest of the drone is not the drone resembles closely to a beam subjected to an axial load due to this observation this study simplifies the drone to a cone beam beam shape in order to model the drone according to beam theory to analyze the buckling and frequency behavior as well as the nonlinear dynamics of the drone subjected to an excitation force the cone beam beam shape represents the head the slim neck and the more rigid and thicker body respectively previous experimental design and numerical and analytical studies have been performed on the response of diving birds and diving systems as they impact water siddall et al 2017 tested the folding wing design to perform smooth water entry weiss weiss showed that a 3d cone can be an estimated representation of the gannet in a streamlined position using computation fluid dynamics yang et al 2012 2013 and wang et al 2013 investigated the direct effect the dive angle and initial velocity have on the force during water entry using computational fluid dynamics wu et al 2019 used a computer science algorithm to determine the forcing and diving trajectory zimmerman et al 2018 developed and verified an analytical model using euler bernoulli theory assumptions with experimental measurements for a gannet inspired system during diving a particular focus was paid to determine the buckling configuration for the system zimmerman and abdelkefi 2020 increased the accuracy of the analytical model from zimmerman et al 2018 to account for systems with lower slenderness ratios by using timoshenko beam theory because this study includes a change in material and geometric properties from one beam to the next and because of the existence of the von karman nonlinearity an exact analytical solution cannot be performed so a numerical procedure is carried out to estimate the drone s response at impact this numerical study should provide guidance on how external excitation can affect the performance of the drone in terms of the forcing damping impact speed and boundary conditions the following study includes the parameter description of the representative gannet inspired diving drones the derivation of the equations of motion and boundary conditions the static and linear vibration modeling and analysis the mathematical modeling on the discretization approach the determination of mode convergence the parametric study to observe the nonlinear hysteresis effects from forcing damping impact velocity and boundary conditions the discussion and recommendations and the concluding comments 2 gannet inspired drone model parameters and description the profile of the gannet drone during a dive is sectioned off into three segments the head which acts as the k 1 boundary condition the neck represented by the slimmer beam and the body represented as the thicker beam as drawn in fig 1 the joint between the neck and the body can be represented by a k 2 continuity condition which in this study is considered as clamped the joint at the end of the body is denoted by the k 3 boundary condition the gannet drone at water entry is subjected to an axial load p and base excitation f 1 2 cos ω t the axial load includes the summation of forces that occur from the change in medium detailed in zimmerman and abdelkefi 2020 the base excitation excites the drone in the direction of bending if the excitation is to be along the axial direction then parametric excitation would need to be considered however for this study it is assumed that the source of excitation will directly affect the motion in the bending direction the neck and body are modeled as separate beams with different cross sectional areas and material properties to better represent a gannet inspired drone the body of a drone may need to be larger in the cross section than the neck to store electrical components the material of the body may also need to be designed stronger than the neck segment to protect the internal components the purpose of the neck is to resemble a similar stiffness as the gannet bird since major electrical components will not be stored in the neck it does not need as strong of a framework as the body however designers can incorporate a type of carbon composite frame to increase the bending resistance of the drone during diving to obtain higher survivability rates for this study it is assumed that only one material is used for the neck beam and it is solid the beam for the body is also modeled as a solid uniform structure with the assumption that the mass resulting from the solid shape is representative of the mass that would be contributed from internal electrical components table 1 presents the geometric parameters of the chosen gannet inspired drones considered for analysis drone label a falls within the geometric range of a gannet bird and an unmanned air vehicle uav drone label b is similar to drone label a but is reduced to the micro air vehicle mav size hassanalian and abdelkefi 2017 drone label c is also reduced to the mav size but with parameters different than system b as found in table 1 systems a and b are designed to have a higher slenderness ratio to fall within a small range of error for euler bernoulli beam theory assumptions to be correct system c is designed to show the evident difference between euler bernoulli and timoshenko theories that occurs for shorter and thicker beams due to the importance of shear deformation wang et al 2007 table 2 describes the material properties for the drone systems all considered drones have the same material properties to maintain a neck stiffness similar to the gannet and a higher head and body stiffness after introducing the systems under investigation next the nonlinear equations of motion are derived using hamilton s principle followed by the static response of the drones 3 systems equations of motion the bending deformation that occurs as a beam buckles under euler bernoulli theory can be observed in zimmerman et al 2018 for segmented beams the bending is much similar and will occur mainly on the neck beam assuming that the material and geometric properties of the body beam are much stronger and larger than the neck beam it should be noted that details on timoshenko beam theory are not provided in this study but readers are referred to zimmerman and abdelkefi 2020 for information on the extensive analytical mathematical modeling the methods for deriving the equations associated with segmented beams for both euler bernoulli and timoshenko beam theories are similar to the procedure from zimmerman and abdelkefi 2020 the following detailed derivations are for euler bernoulli theory with the inclusion of the excitation force under euler bernoulli theory the virtual kinetic energy of the system for segmented beams is found as 1 δ t 0 x b m 1 w 1 δ w 1 d x x b l m 2 w 2 δ w 2 d x

timoshenko theory the limits of applicability for euler bernoulli theory are investigated and chosen to further the study for nonlinear dynamic analysis for its ease in modeling 4 static buckling formulation and analysis before nonlinear dynamics is performed on the systems under consideration the static response is carried out to determine which drone systems are capable of being modeled under euler bernoulli theory to obtain the static governing equations the time dependent terms from the equations of motion are dropped finding 9 ψ 1 4 λ 2 ψ 1 0 ψ 2 4 s λ 2 ψ 2 0 where λ 2 p ˆ s p l

1 s 2 ψ 2 η table 3 details the buckling speeds the drone systems can endure under different boundary conditions it also displays the error euler bernoulli theory has with respect to timoshenko beam theory in table 3 two values are listed for timoshenko theory because the shear modulus listed for vinyl polysiloxane in table 2 is estimated the second value considered for the shear modulus in this investigation is g 1 585 10 6 pa in response to this slight change with respect to the pla shear modulus the error with euler bernoulli theory shows to decrease significantly highlighting the sensitivity the shear modulus has on the buckling occurrence it should be noted that column t 1 refers to the timoshenko value calculated from the shear modulus of 0 317 10 6 pa and column t 2 refers to the timoshenko value calculated from the shear modulus of 1 585 10 6 pa the static analysis focuses on the extreme boundary condition cases clamped clamped and hinged hinged however in table 3 the boundary conditions of hinged clamped are also included to show that their buckling velocities will lie within the two extreme cases the analysis of varying the stiffnesses to be within the two extreme bounds will be further explored in section 6 2 3 the bifurcation diagrams in fig 2 are shown for drone systems a b and c under clamped clamped c c and hinged hinged h h boundary conditions to visually show the variance in error from table 3 considering both shear modulus estimations the bifurcation diagrams describe the velocity at which the system buckles and the deformation that occurs past the point of buckling measured at the quarter length the first timoshenko estimation t 1 is denoted by the solid line the second timoshenko estimation t 2 is found by the dash dot line and euler bernoulli e b is represented by the dashed line notice that reducing the stiffness in the boundary conditions to hinged conditions provides very low error between timoshenko estimations and euler bernoulli theory it is observed that using the second shear modulus estimation for timoshenko theory provides excellent agreement with euler bernoulli theory for clamped clamped boundary conditions as well as the hinged hinged boundary conditions for drone systems a and b observations from fig 2 suggest that clamped clamped boundary conditions provide more error for euler bernoulli theory than hinged hinged however the consideration of a higher shear modulus value for vinyl polysiloxane decreases the error for drones a and b hinged hinged boundary conditions contribute a softening effect to the beam significantly decreasing the error between theories regardless of the chosen shear modulus value hinged hinged boundary conditions also reveal lower buckling speeds and higher buckling amplitudes due to the softening effect drone c shows large error for euler bernoulli theory under both clamped clamped and hinged hinged boundary conditions therefore the authors estimate that because of the uncertainty with the vinyl polysiloxane shear calculation drone systems a and b can be modeled under euler bernoulli theory for ease in modeling while drone system c cannot even with the increased shift in the shear modulus value drone systems a and b are chosen for further analysis of exploring the pre and post buckling linear vibrations euler bernoulli theory is also assumed to be adequate for modeling the nonlinear frequency response of these selected systems 5 determination of the coupled natural frequencies and mode shapes the pre buckling region follows the same form as the post buckling modeling but with the static relations set to zero therefore the following equations are in terms of post buckling only but can easily be applied for pre buckling readers can also refer to zimmerman and abdelkefi 2020 for further detail to obtain a post buckling dynamic analysis a small dynamic disturbance should be introduced to the static buckling providing the relations 12 w ˆ 1 x

diving speeds in these plots the post buckling region is also observed to show the frequency trend as it approaches and surpasses buckling the linear vibration problem is a necessary step before investigating the nonlinear frequency response because it describes where resonance will occur according to each buckling speed fig 3 a and b are the natural frequencies for drone a under clamped clamped and hinged hinged boundary conditions respectively fig 3 c and d are the natural frequencies for drone b under clamped clamped and hinged hinged boundary conditions note that the clamped clamped boundary conditions are considered when the k 1 and k 3 stiffnesses equal 105 nm and the hinged hinged boundary conditions are considered when k 1 and k 3 stiffnesses equal 10 5 nm to avoid numerical complications in fig 3 there is a clear frequency difference between timoshenko and euler bernoulli theories for the clamped clamped conditions marking how the first mode of natural frequency tends to zero at buckling for each theory for the hinged hinged conditions this marking is unclear because the buckling speeds have minimal error however the calculated value for higher modes can be observed because of the minimal error under hinged hinged conditions the velocity where each theory approaches zero is not identified but specifics can be observed from section 4 table 4 is displayed to sample the natural frequency error between theories at chosen impact speeds the error generally increases as the modes increase due to a softening that occurs in the system as it surpasses one mode clamped clamped shows to vary from the trend when reaching the third mode however because the first mode shows reasonable error the authors proceed with euler bernoulli for ease in modeling when the shear in the neck is stronger as with the case for the second estimated timoshenko value t 2 then a lower percentage of error is observed note that if the system becomes significantly thicker then the increase of error between theories will be influenced by the low slenderness ratio as was observed previously with drone system c a sample observation on the pre buckling mode shapes for each condition found in fig 3 are shown in fig 4 considering the impact velocity of 2 m s the mode shapes influence the behavior of the nonlinear frequency response in section 6 which is why 2 m s is chosen post buckling mode shapes are not considered because they do not provide relevant information to this study as the system s behavior before buckling is more critical for drone survivability the material and geometric parameters clearly affect the characteristics of the system determination of the exact material properties is also evidently needed for the best prediction of how the fabricated drone will behave experimentally as was shown by how significantly the shear modulus value predicts the behavior next the modeling of the nonlinear response to forcing excitation is provided 6 performance analysis and considerations of forcing excitations the frequency response analysis can be performed in the pre and post buckling however because the concern for any disturbances to act on the drone during diving is of more importance before the drone becomes damaged the nonlinear modeling for the frequency response only considers the dynamic pre buckling region note that system resonances will occur in the post buckling region which may be of concern for other applications but provide irrelevant information for this study and are therefore not investigated further details on the pre buckling nonlinear modeling are presented to show the procedure of applying discretization to reduce the pde to an ode 6 1 nonlinear reduced order modeling for the pre buckling region to approximate the nonlinear frequency response a method must be employed to convert the pde to an ode because the pde is dependent on coordinates x and t galerkin discretization allows the equation to become dependent on t only for the pre buckling region the galerkin approach is employed which can be defined as 24 w x t n 1 n ϕ n x q n t which for segmented beams can be rewritten as 25 w 1 x t n 1 n ϕ 1 n x q n t w 2 x t n 1 n ϕ 2 n x q n t where n is the number of retained modes ϕ n x represents the n th linear vibration mode shape and q n t denotes the

next a convergence analysis is achieved to select the number of modes adequate for approximating the nonlinear frequency behavior 6 2 convergence analysis required number of modes for the galerkin method a convergence analysis is performed to determine the number of modes that are appropriate for estimating the system s response this allows for an approximation of the frequency response without losing accuracy from neglecting additional modes clamped clamped and hinged hinged boundary conditions are considered for convergence determination to capture the effects when the stiffness is very high versus very low considering these boundary conditions a low and high forcing of 1 and 10 n are demonstrated with a low and high damping factor of 0 005 and 0 1 for drone a in figs 5 and 6 because drone b has a much lower mass the low and high forcing considered are 0 1 and 1 n with the same low and high damping factors as drone a as shown in fig 7 in this study a general forcing trend is considered because forcing can occur from multiple sources such as base excitation propellers or actuation mechanisms the forcing estimation for this study arises from base excitation it should be noted that it would take experimental measures to obtain exact forcing parameters and therefore a parametric study is performed to observe the trend from decreasing to increasing parameters in figs 5 7 a hardening behavior is clearly observed hardening occurs from the von karman cubic nonlinearity found in equation 22 if the frequency response is investigated in the post buckling region then the presence of a quadratic nonlinearity would be observed in addition to the cubic nonlinearity and hence a softening nonlinear behavior may appear note that lower damping and higher forcing can affect convergence as observed in fig 5 c 6 c and 7 c from these convergence plots the hysteresis region from the clamped clamped to the hinged hinged boundary conditions show a difference in that clamped clamped provides a larger bandwidth but a smaller deflection than the hinged hinged boundary conditions the deflection observation can be explained by the pre buckling mode shapes in section 5 it should be mentioned that high values of amplitudes can be seen in figs 5 7 due to considering low damping and high forcing values simultaneously the target of this is to determine the required number of modes in the galerkin discretization to be considered for further investigation to directly determine the error between modes table 5 takes the maximum value for the third mode and calculates the error with the first and second mode with respect to the third mode at the corresponding excitation frequency as shown convergence usually occurs after the second mode so three modes should be sufficient for representing higher modes from this section three modes are concluded to be sufficient since the error between the second and third modes shows to be minimal and therefore only three modes are utilized for the remainder of this study 6 3 survivability of drones during diving as mentioned previously without experimental measurements the appropriate forcing cannot be determined for such a system so a parametric study is carried out to investigate the general trend of how velocity forcing damping and boundary conditions all affect the resonance region the analysis is broken up into three sections to study the effects based on clamped clamped boundary conditions hinged hinged boundary conditions and the effects when varying the boundary conditions in between the two extremes 6 3 1 clamped clamped marine drone configuration to investigate the nonlinear response of drone a the forcing values of 1 4 7 and 10 n are considered with damping of 0 005 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 fig 8 a presents the velocity trend with both increasing and decreasing initial conditions where applicable fig 8 b shows the damping trend with increasing and decreasing initial conditions fig 8 c observes the forcing trend for increasing and decreasing initial conditions the vibration backbone is also presented denoted by the orange dash dot line to show the maximum deflection profile with increasing forcing it follows from the plotted curves in fig 8 a that as the impact velocity increases in addition to the decrease in the linear coupled frequency which is presented by the vertical dotted lines in fig 8 a the nonlinear hardening behavior more prominently occurs to explain this result table 6 shows the nonlinear coefficient considering only one mode in the galerkin discretization to provide a further understanding on how the hardening behavior becomes affected when subjected to varying impact speeds indeed based on equation 22 when this nonlinear coefficient is negative a hardening behavior takes place the magnitude of this coefficient gives an idea on the strength of the present nonlinearity as described in table 6 and fig 8 a in addition to the nonlinear hardening behavior increasing in fig 8 a the amplitude of the displacement also increases accordingly the velocity directly corresponds to the axial load applied on the system as the axial load increases the system will respond with higher deflection until it can no longer withstand buckling as the damping increases in fig 8 b the system responds with lower deflection and the nonlinearity effects diminish as the forcing increases in fig 8 c the nonlinearity becomes more present and the resonance band covers a larger frequency range these plots imply that to minimize the nonlinear effects the deflection and the resonance range the impact velocity and external excitation force should decrease and the damping should increase similar to drone a the study on drone b considers the damping factors of 0 005 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 however the forcing considered is 0 1 0 5 and 1 n the decrease in the forcing range is due to drone b being smaller meaning that a forcing range from 1 to 10 n would require much higher base acceleration speeds than with drone a fig 9 a and b and 9 c show the velocity trend the damping trend and the forcing trend under increasing and decreasing initial conditions where applicable the vibration backbone is also included in fig 9 c again the nonlinear hardening behavior is observed as the velocity increases in fig 9 a so table 7 is presented to show the nonlinear coefficient considering only one mode as the impact speed decreases the b 1111 decreases accordingly also the deflection decreases as well because as the speed decreases the axial load decreases resulting in less load attributing to the deformation on the drone next the extreme boundary conditions of hinged hinged are investigated because the mode shapes change significantly for non geometric and material uniform beams with changing boundary conditions the shift in the nonlinearity is not as fluid as a uniform beam 6 3 2 hinged hinged marine drone configuration the hinged hinged boundary conditions are only considered for drone a to understand the general trend from one extreme boundary condition to the other in this study the forcing values of 1 4 7 and 10 n are considered with damping of 0 005 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 as was used with the clamped clamped case for drone a fig 10 a observes the nonlinear hardening effects with different speeds fig 10 b considers a variance on damping coefficient and fig 10 c investigates the variance on forcing excitation the hinged hinged case for drone a reveals deformations higher than the clamped clamped case for drone a as expected because there is a greater linear softening in the beam because the natural frequencies occur much lower due to the softening there is not a large change in frequency occurrences between the chosen speeds as is observed in fig 10 a therefore it is observed that a velocity of 8 m s will affect the same frequencies that are present for lower impact speeds a larger negative b 1111 coefficient also results in a stronger nonlinear hardening behavior contributing to the larger broadband and higher deflection found for the frequency response for drone a at 8 m s details on the nonlinear coefficient are listed in table 8 similar trends are found for increasing the forcing and damping in fig 10 c the nonlinearity effect of hardening is diminished due to the high damping that is chosen providing insight on how to control the nonlinear dynamics from creating nonlinear response during diving the extreme boundary conditions are explored next the observation on changing the boundary conditions from one extreme to the next and the stiffnesses in between are shown 6 3 3 understanding the stiffness variance effects on the survivability of the marine drone this section deeply explores the variance on the boundary stiffnesses because of the continuous beam s complex geometric and material properties the trend also becomes complex to observe the trend table 9 shows the buckling speed the linear natural frequency and the nonlinear coefficient that corresponds to the cubic nonlinearity of the system changing from hinged hinged to clamped clamped is straightforward for a symmetric uniform beam where the buckling speed and linear frequency increase accordingly the nonlinear coefficient decreases as the nonlinear hardening behavior is stronger for the hinged hinged case than the clamped clamped case while for geometric and material complex beams the trend of the buckling and linear frequency will portray a similar trend the nonlinear coefficient is not consistent since it is purely dependent on the mode shapes because the mode shape vary deeply due to the non uniform system table 9 reviews the nonlinear trend considering different stiffnesses for reference from the work of nayfeh and mook 2008 using perturbation techniques the response of the system depends on the nonlinear coefficient the natural frequency the damping coefficient the forcing frequency and the forcing amplitude as detailed in equation 23 because the nonlinear coefficient is influenced by many different variables the offset trend for a continuous beam with changing material and geometric parameters seems reasonable 31 ξ ω 1 2 ω ω 1 3 b 1111 q 1 2 8 ω 1 2 f 2 4 ω 1 2 q 1 2 according to table 9 if the stronger thicker beam is clamped essentially moving minimally compared with the thinner flexible beam then a familiar trend can be observed with the changing k 1 boundary condition from hinged to clamped where more hardening and more deflection is observed for the hinged condition because of this familiar trend the nonlinear frequency response is visually shown in fig 11 the plotted curves in this figure show the hardening to softening observation from hinged to clamped conditions at the impact speed of 8 m s and the damping factor of 0 1 fig 11 a b and 11 c consider the changing k 1 boundary condition when the force is set to 1 n 5 n and 10 n respectively the other observation to note with fig 11 is that as the forcing increases from 1 n to 10 n the hardening behavior appears more prominently the resonance broadband covers a larger frequency range and the deflection increases this hints that to promote drone survivability a smaller drone mass should be selected to decrease the total base excitation on the system if the base acceleration is out of the designer s control next a discussion is presented based off the observations that have been interpreted with the nonlinear frequency response recommendations for drone design are also discussed based off the estimated trends that were obtained from this current investigation 7 discussion and recommendations the size of the drone should be engineered with respect to the space needed for machine and electrical components as well as in accordance with the mission requirements extra space may be required to hold the components needed to perform wing folding wing and body compression and extension and propulsion in that case a thicker drone body width would need to be incorporated in which timoshenko modeling should then be used in place of euler bernoulli theory to obtain more accurate estimations a drone reduced to the mav size may be useful for maneuvering in and out of small spaces due to debris or brush obstruction a smaller sized drone may also provide other benefits due to its reduction in mass such as requiring less lift for flight to obtain higher rates of drone survivability increasing the speed of buckling would be helpful because then the drone can safely dive at higher speeds without significantly lowering its natural frequency as it does when it nears buckling for example if the drone systems a and b under clamped boundary conditions were set to dive at 20 m s then more nonlinear dynamic response could occur due to the natural frequency being close to zero at this velocity however if the buckling velocities were increased by either designing a more rigid neck from choosing a stronger material or including a strong frame then assigning a diving velocity near 20 m s would make the drone less likely to fail from material deformation or buckling an increase in forcing was found to increase the resonance bandwidth under drone applications a large broadband is not desired for drone design because this increases the range at which the drone could malfunction making it difficult to select an appropriate speed for a propeller or making it hard to avoid base excitation conversely increasing the damping reduces the hardening behavior and thus decreases not only the broadband region but also lowers the resonance amplitude lowering the chance of catastrophic behavior therefore when designing a drone high damping should be considered to reduce the effects from the forcing and nonlinearity which will help the drone withstand possible external sources of excitation noticeable effects occur on the nonlinear frequency response as the velocity varies increasing the velocity increases the axial load experienced on the system resulting in a lower natural frequency as observed in section 4 increasing the axial load appears to directly affect the nonlinearity of the system by increasing the bandwidth of the resonance region moreover with increasing initial conditions the resulting maximum deflection is also increased at higher impact velocities with these observations considering impact velocities well below the buckling speed might be useful in preventing buckling prediction error low natural frequencies and large resonance bands the boundary conditions of the drone when entering water should also be carefully selected to maximize the impact speed at which the drone will buckle clamped clamped conditions consistently show to not only increase the buckling speed but also decrease the deflection subjected to resonance and reduce the resonance broadband when compared with a hinged condition if possible near clamped clamped conditions should be employed based off the estimated response from this study however the exploration of other boundary conditions such as the cantilever condition could provide further insight on drone behavior during diving and may show to be the more appropriate choice for minimizing catastrophic behavior or buckling in summary to increase the survivability of the drone on a diving mission four drone design considerations should be reviewed first a large damper should be included to minimize the nonlinear characteristics of the system regardless of the external excitation applied second forcing from the excitation components should be minimized where reasonable to also reduce the hysteresis region minimizing the force from sources of base excitation without reducing a significant amount of acceleration can be accomplished with systems that have a smaller mass i e mavs third a much lower velocity than the buckling speed should be considered to avoid lower resonant frequencies and to also minimize the nonlinear effects drone systems with very high buckling speed characteristics are ideal so that a lower velocity can be chosen without compromising the effectiveness of the drone increasing the buckling speed characteristics would entail considering materials with a higher bending stiffness and thicker geometry as was demonstrated in zimmerman and abdelkefi 2020 other factors to consider are the half beak angle of the head the length and radius of the head and the length of the body which are also shown in zimmerman et al 2018 and zimmerman and abdelkefi 2020 fourth the boundary conditions should be chosen appropriately to minimize the nonlinearity effect the resonance region and the deflection of the drone during diving 8 conclusions this work investigated the effects the impact velocity damping external forcing amplitude and boundary conditions have on gannet inspired drones during diving euler bernoulli theory was utilized for model development using the extended hamilton s principle the equations of motion were derived galerkin discretization was applied to reduce the equations of motion to an ode to approximate the nonlinear dynamic response subjected to external excitation a convergence analysis was carried out to determine the required number of modes in the galerkin discretization to accurately estimate the system s response the general trend of how the drone behaved according to the changing parameters of forcing damping velocity and boundary conditions were studied offering an idea of how the drone may respond if not designed with careful consideration it was observed that the nonlinearity effect is more prominent with an increase in forcing and impact speed and a decrease in damping and boundary condition stiffnesses the nonlinearity effect if dominant increases the maximum deflection and increases the resonance broadband supplying the drone with a higher chance of encountering catastrophic behavior declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
20210,many external sources of excitation can interfere with the performance of drones such as propeller or flapping motion this work investigates the effects external excitation plays on the nonlinear system s dynamics of gannet inspired drones using euler bernoulli beam theory the partial differential equations of motion are solved following the hamilton s principle galerkin discretization is then applied to convert the equations of motion to ordinary differential equations in which to obtain an approximation for the nonlinear dynamic response before buckling occurs the model is inspired by the gannet bird where the head is simplified to a cone shape the neck is resembled by a soft beam and the rest of the body is represented by a stiff thicker beam to suggest a buckling behavior physical for the diving bird if buckling is to occur the results observe the direct effects the external forcing the damping the impact velocity and the boundary conditions have on the resonant frequency range and deflection the results estimate that increasing the forcing amplitude will in turn amplify the hardening behavior and the maximum displacement to maintain a lower forcing amplitude consistent with a reasonable external acceleration a smaller drone mass should be employed it is observed that higher damping should be applied to minimize the drone s nonlinear effects the speed at which the drone impacts the water should be chosen to be lower than the estimated buckling speed to avoid lower natural frequencies and to reduce the hysteresis region in order to minimize the nonlinear behavior from the boundary conditions explored stiffer boundary conditions should be employed to increase the buckling speed and reduce the deflection when entering water keywords bioinspiration segmented beams dynamic analysis euler bernoulli beam theory galerkin discretization nonlinear analysis 1 introduction marine drones able to fly dive swim and exit water can increase the physical range of mission performance from air near the water s surface to under the water drones are used to eliminate the need for direct human involvement which may allow ease with performing surveillance and observation for military civilian and environmental applications shahid et al 2019 siddall and kovač 2014 yang et al 2015 hassanalian and abdelkefi 2017 salazar et al 2018 2019 murphy et al 2008 smaller sized drones could also allow for entry into small spaces however design of a drone includes machine components that create their own source of vibrations such as an actuator used for wing swept back to aid in smooth water entry wing flapping to provide movement between mediums or wing extension to help control lift these external vibrations can lead to issues with undesired resonances potentially affecting the resulting performance of the drone if the speed of the actuator and the drone are not carefully selected this study is interested in incorporating an external source of excitation to better understand the influence between excitation and the drone s inherent nonlinear dynamics and performance investigation on the nonlinear frequency response has been analyzed for single beams to compare experimental measures with discretization and direct techniques by lacarbonara et al 1998 and to explore using higher modes for approximation by emam and nayfeh 2004 nonlinear frequency responses have also been performed for single hinged hinged microbeams by ghayesh et al 2013 for cantilever carbon nanotube beams by talò et al 2020 and for continuous carbon nanotube beams intended for mass sensing applications by ali akbari et al 2019 and ghaffari et al 2020 for this current study a discretization technique using the galerkin approach is considered to transform the nonlinear partial differential equations of motion pde formulated from the extended hamilton s principle to an ordinary differential equation ode in order to estimate the nonlinear response activated from external vibration the drone models are inspired by the gannet bird because of their efficient performance with diving into water to catch prey raubenhelmer 2013 bhar et al 2019 ropert coudert et al 2004 at the point of impact when the head is underwater and the rest of the drone is not the drone resembles closely to a beam subjected to an axial load due to this observation this study simplifies the drone to a cone beam beam shape in order to model the drone according to beam theory to analyze the buckling and frequency behavior as well as the nonlinear dynamics of the drone subjected to an excitation force the cone beam beam shape represents the head the slim neck and the more rigid and thicker body respectively previous experimental design and numerical and analytical studies have been performed on the response of diving birds and diving systems as they impact water siddall et al 2017 tested the folding wing design to perform smooth water entry weiss weiss showed that a 3d cone can be an estimated representation of the gannet in a streamlined position using computation fluid dynamics yang et al 2012 2013 and wang et al 2013 investigated the direct effect the dive angle and initial velocity have on the force during water entry using computational fluid dynamics wu et al 2019 used a computer science algorithm to determine the forcing and diving trajectory zimmerman et al 2018 developed and verified an analytical model using euler bernoulli theory assumptions with experimental measurements for a gannet inspired system during diving a particular focus was paid to determine the buckling configuration for the system zimmerman and abdelkefi 2020 increased the accuracy of the analytical model from zimmerman et al 2018 to account for systems with lower slenderness ratios by using timoshenko beam theory because this study includes a change in material and geometric properties from one beam to the next and because of the existence of the von karman nonlinearity an exact analytical solution cannot be performed so a numerical procedure is carried out to estimate the drone s response at impact this numerical study should provide guidance on how external excitation can affect the performance of the drone in terms of the forcing damping impact speed and boundary conditions the following study includes the parameter description of the representative gannet inspired diving drones the derivation of the equations of motion and boundary conditions the static and linear vibration modeling and analysis the mathematical modeling on the discretization approach the determination of mode convergence the parametric study to observe the nonlinear hysteresis effects from forcing damping impact velocity and boundary conditions the discussion and recommendations and the concluding comments 2 gannet inspired drone model parameters and description the profile of the gannet drone during a dive is sectioned off into three segments the head which acts as the k 1 boundary condition the neck represented by the slimmer beam and the body represented as the thicker beam as drawn in fig 1 the joint between the neck and the body can be represented by a k 2 continuity condition which in this study is considered as clamped the joint at the end of the body is denoted by the k 3 boundary condition the gannet drone at water entry is subjected to an axial load p and base excitation f 1 2 cos ω t the axial load includes the summation of forces that occur from the change in medium detailed in zimmerman and abdelkefi 2020 the base excitation excites the drone in the direction of bending if the excitation is to be along the axial direction then parametric excitation would need to be considered however for this study it is assumed that the source of excitation will directly affect the motion in the bending direction the neck and body are modeled as separate beams with different cross sectional areas and material properties to better represent a gannet inspired drone the body of a drone may need to be larger in the cross section than the neck to store electrical components the material of the body may also need to be designed stronger than the neck segment to protect the internal components the purpose of the neck is to resemble a similar stiffness as the gannet bird since major electrical components will not be stored in the neck it does not need as strong of a framework as the body however designers can incorporate a type of carbon composite frame to increase the bending resistance of the drone during diving to obtain higher survivability rates for this study it is assumed that only one material is used for the neck beam and it is solid the beam for the body is also modeled as a solid uniform structure with the assumption that the mass resulting from the solid shape is representative of the mass that would be contributed from internal electrical components table 1 presents the geometric parameters of the chosen gannet inspired drones considered for analysis drone label a falls within the geometric range of a gannet bird and an unmanned air vehicle uav drone label b is similar to drone label a but is reduced to the micro air vehicle mav size hassanalian and abdelkefi 2017 drone label c is also reduced to the mav size but with parameters different than system b as found in table 1 systems a and b are designed to have a higher slenderness ratio to fall within a small range of error for euler bernoulli beam theory assumptions to be correct system c is designed to show the evident difference between euler bernoulli and timoshenko theories that occurs for shorter and thicker beams due to the importance of shear deformation wang et al 2007 table 2 describes the material properties for the drone systems all considered drones have the same material properties to maintain a neck stiffness similar to the gannet and a higher head and body stiffness after introducing the systems under investigation next the nonlinear equations of motion are derived using hamilton s principle followed by the static response of the drones 3 systems equations of motion the bending deformation that occurs as a beam buckles under euler bernoulli theory can be observed in zimmerman et al 2018 for segmented beams the bending is much similar and will occur mainly on the neck beam assuming that the material and geometric properties of the body beam are much stronger and larger than the neck beam it should be noted that details on timoshenko beam theory are not provided in this study but readers are referred to zimmerman and abdelkefi 2020 for information on the extensive analytical mathematical modeling the methods for deriving the equations associated with segmented beams for both euler bernoulli and timoshenko beam theories are similar to the procedure from zimmerman and abdelkefi 2020 the following detailed derivations are for euler bernoulli theory

timoshenko theory the limits of applicability for euler bernoulli theory are investigated and chosen to further the study for nonlinear dynamic analysis for its ease in modeling 4 static buckling formulation and analysis before nonlinear dynamics is performed on the systems under consideration the static response is carried out to determine which drone systems are capable of being modeled under euler bernoulli theory to obtain the static governing equations the time dependent terms from the equations of motion are dropped finding 9 ψ 1 4 λ 2 ψ 1 0 ψ 2 4 s λ 2 ψ 2 0 where λ 2 p ˆ s p l

theory in table 3 two values are listed for timoshenko theory because the shear modulus listed for vinyl polysiloxane in table 2 is estimated the second value considered for the shear modulus in this investigation is g 1 585 10 6 pa in response to this slight change with respect to the pla shear modulus the error with euler bernoulli theory shows to decrease significantly highlighting the sensitivity the shear modulus has on the buckling occurrence it should be noted that column t 1 refers to the timoshenko value calculated from the shear modulus of 0 317 10 6 pa and column t 2 refers to the timoshenko value calculated from the shear modulus of 1 585 10 6 pa the static analysis focuses on the extreme boundary condition cases clamped clamped and hinged hinged however in table 3 the boundary conditions of hinged clamped are also included to show that their buckling velocities will lie within the two extreme cases the analysis of varying the stiffnesses to be within the two extreme bounds will be further explored in section 6 2 3 the bifurcation diagrams in fig 2 are shown for drone systems a b and c under clamped clamped c c and hinged hinged h h boundary conditions to visually show the variance in error from table 3 considering both shear modulus estimations the bifurcation diagrams describe the velocity at which the system buckles and the deformation that occurs past the point of buckling measured at the quarter length the first timoshenko estimation t 1 is denoted by the solid line the second timoshenko estimation t 2 is found by the dash dot line and euler bernoulli e b is represented by the dashed line notice that reducing the stiffness in the boundary conditions to hinged conditions provides very low error between timoshenko estimations and euler bernoulli theory it is observed that using the second shear modulus estimation for timoshenko theory provides excellent agreement with euler bernoulli theory for clamped clamped boundary conditions as well as the hinged hinged boundary conditions for drone systems a and b observations from fig 2 suggest that clamped clamped boundary conditions provide more error for euler bernoulli theory than hinged hinged however the consideration of a higher shear modulus value for vinyl polysiloxane decreases the error for drones a and b hinged hinged boundary conditions contribute a softening effect to the beam significantly decreasing the error between theories regardless of the chosen shear modulus value hinged hinged boundary conditions also reveal lower buckling speeds and higher buckling amplitudes due to the softening effect drone c shows large error for euler bernoulli theory under both clamped clamped and hinged hinged boundary conditions therefore the authors estimate that because of the uncertainty with the vinyl polysiloxane shear calculation drone systems a and b can be modeled under euler bernoulli theory for ease in modeling while drone system c cannot even with the increased shift in the shear modulus value drone systems a and b are chosen for further analysis of exploring the pre and post buckling linear vibrations euler bernoulli theory is also assumed to be adequate for modeling the nonlinear frequency response of these selected systems 5 determination of the coupled natural frequencies and mode shapes the pre buckling region follows the same form as the post buckling modeling but with the static relations set to zero therefore the following equations are in terms of post buckling only but can easily be applied for pre buckling readers can also refer to zimmerman and abdelkefi 2020 for further detail to obtain a post buckling dynamic analysis a small dynamic disturbance should be introduced to the static buckling providing the relations 12 w ˆ 1 x

diving speeds in these plots the post buckling region is also observed to show the frequency trend as it approaches and surpasses buckling the linear vibration problem is a necessary step before investigating the nonlinear frequency response because it describes where resonance will occur according to each buckling speed fig 3 a and b are the natural frequencies for drone a under clamped clamped and hinged hinged boundary conditions respectively fig 3 c and d are the natural frequencies for drone b under clamped clamped and hinged hinged boundary conditions note that the clamped clamped boundary conditions are considered when the k 1 and k 3 stiffnesses equal 105 nm and the hinged hinged boundary conditions are considered when k 1 and k 3 stiffnesses equal 10 5 nm to avoid numerical complications in fig 3 there is a clear frequency difference between timoshenko and euler bernoulli theories for the clamped clamped conditions marking how the first mode of natural frequency tends to zero at buckling for each theory for the hinged hinged conditions this marking is unclear because the buckling speeds have minimal error however the calculated value for higher modes can be observed because of the minimal error under hinged hinged conditions the velocity where each theory approaches zero is not identified but specifics can be observed from section 4 table 4 is displayed to sample the natural frequency error between theories at chosen impact speeds the error generally increases as the modes increase due to a softening that occurs in the system as it surpasses one mode clamped clamped shows to vary from the trend when reaching the third mode however because the first mode shows reasonable error the authors proceed with euler bernoulli for ease in modeling when the shear in the neck is stronger as with the case for the second estimated timoshenko value t 2 then a lower percentage of error is observed note that if the system becomes significantly thicker then the increase of error between theories will be influenced by the low slenderness ratio as was observed previously with drone system c a sample observation on the pre buckling mode shapes for each condition found in fig 3 are shown in fig 4 considering the impact velocity of 2 m s the mode shapes influence the behavior of the nonlinear frequency response in section 6 which is why 2 m s is chosen post buckling mode shapes are not considered because they do not provide relevant information to this study as the system s behavior before buckling is more critical for drone survivability the material and geometric parameters clearly affect the characteristics of the system determination of the exact material properties is also evidently needed for the best prediction of how the fabricated drone will behave experimentally as was shown by how significantly the shear modulus value predicts the behavior next the modeling of the nonlinear response to forcing excitation is provided 6 performance analysis and considerations of forcing excitations the frequency response analysis can be performed in the pre and post buckling however because the concern for any disturbances to act on the drone during diving is of more importance before the drone becomes damaged the nonlinear modeling for the frequency response only considers the dynamic pre buckling region note that system resonances will occur in the post buckling region which may be of concern for other applications but provide irrelevant information for this study and are therefore not investigated further details on the pre buckling nonlinear modeling are presented to show the procedure of applying discretization to reduce the pde to an ode 6 1 nonlinear reduced order modeling for the pre buckling region to approximate the nonlinear frequency response a method must be employed to convert the pde to an ode because the pde is dependent on coordinates x and t galerkin discretization allows the equation to become dependent on t only for the pre buckling region the galerkin approach is employed which can be defined as 24 w x t n 1 n ϕ n x q n t which for segmented beams can be rewritten as 25 w 1 x t n 1 n ϕ 1 n x q n t w 2 x t n 1 n ϕ 2 n x q n t where n is the number of retained modes ϕ n x represents the n th linear vibration mode shape and q n t denotes the n th modal coordinate from the equations of motion the orthogonality conditions are defined as 26 0 η ϕ 1 n ϕ 1 m d x ζ η 1 ϕ 2 n ϕ 2 m d x δ n m 27 0 η ℓ ϕ 1 n ϕ 1 m d x η 1 ℓ ϕ 2 n ϕ 2 m d x δ n m ω

next a convergence analysis is achieved to select the number of modes adequate for approximating the nonlinear frequency behavior 6 2 convergence analysis required number of modes for the galerkin method a convergence analysis is performed to determine the number of modes that are appropriate for estimating the system s response this allows for an approximation of the frequency response without losing accuracy from neglecting additional modes clamped clamped and hinged hinged boundary conditions are considered for convergence determination to capture the effects when the stiffness is very high versus very low considering these boundary conditions a low and high forcing of 1 and 10 n are demonstrated with a low and high damping factor of 0 005 and 0 1 for drone a in figs 5 and 6 because drone b has a much lower mass the low and high forcing considered are 0 1 and 1 n with the same low and high damping factors as drone a as shown in fig 7 in this study a general forcing trend is considered because forcing can occur from multiple sources such as base excitation propellers or actuation mechanisms the forcing estimation for this study arises from base excitation it should be noted that it would take experimental measures to obtain exact forcing parameters and therefore a parametric study is performed to observe the trend from decreasing to increasing parameters in figs 5 7 a hardening behavior is clearly observed hardening occurs from the von karman cubic nonlinearity found in equation 22 if the frequency response is investigated in the post buckling region then the presence of a quadratic nonlinearity would be observed in addition to the cubic nonlinearity and hence a softening nonlinear behavior may appear note that lower damping and higher forcing can affect convergence as observed in fig 5 c 6 c and 7 c from these convergence plots the hysteresis region from the clamped clamped to the hinged hinged boundary conditions show a difference in that clamped clamped provides a larger bandwidth but a smaller deflection than the hinged hinged boundary conditions the deflection observation can be explained by the pre buckling mode shapes in section 5 it should be mentioned that high values of amplitudes can be seen in figs 5 7 due to considering low damping and high forcing values simultaneously the target of this is to determine the required number of modes in the galerkin discretization to be considered for further investigation to directly determine the error between modes table 5 takes the maximum value for the third mode and calculates the error with the first and second mode with respect to the third mode at the corresponding excitation frequency as shown convergence usually occurs after the second mode so three modes should be sufficient for representing higher modes from this section three modes are concluded to be sufficient since the error between the second and third modes shows to be minimal and therefore only three modes are utilized for the remainder of this study 6 3 survivability of drones during diving as mentioned previously without experimental measurements the appropriate forcing cannot be determined for such a system so a parametric study is carried out to investigate the general trend of how velocity forcing damping and boundary conditions all affect the resonance region the analysis is broken up into three sections to study the effects based on clamped clamped boundary conditions hinged hinged boundary conditions and the effects when varying the boundary conditions in between the two extremes 6 3 1 clamped clamped marine drone configuration to investigate the nonlinear response of drone a the forcing values of 1 4 7 and 10 n are considered with damping of 0 005 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 fig 8 a presents the velocity trend with both increasing and decreasing initial conditions where applicable fig 8 b shows the damping trend with increasing and decreasing initial conditions fig 8 c observes the forcing trend for increasing and decreasing initial conditions the vibration backbone is also presented denoted by the orange dash dot line to show the maximum deflection profile with increasing forcing it follows from the plotted curves in fig 8 a that as the impact velocity increases in addition to the decrease in the linear coupled frequency which is presented by the vertical dotted lines in fig 8 a the nonlinear hardening behavior more prominently occurs to explain this result table 6 shows the nonlinear coefficient considering only one mode in the galerkin discretization to provide a further understanding on how the hardening behavior becomes affected when subjected to varying impact speeds indeed based on equation 22 when this nonlinear coefficient is negative a hardening behavior takes place the magnitude of this coefficient gives an idea on the strength of the present nonlinearity as described in table 6 and fig 8 a in addition to the nonlinear hardening behavior increasing in fig 8 a the amplitude of the displacement also increases accordingly the velocity directly corresponds to the axial load applied on the system as the axial load increases the system will respond with higher deflection until it can no longer withstand buckling as the damping increases in fig 8 b the system responds with lower deflection and the nonlinearity effects diminish as the forcing increases in fig 8 c the nonlinearity becomes more present and the resonance band covers a larger frequency range these plots imply that to minimize the nonlinear effects the deflection and the resonance range the impact velocity and external excitation force should decrease and the damping should increase similar to drone a the study on drone b considers the damping factors of 0 005 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 however the forcing considered is 0 1 0 5 and 1 n the decrease in the forcing range is due to drone b being smaller meaning that a forcing range from 1 to 10 n would require much higher base acceleration speeds than with drone a fig 9 a and b and 9 c show the velocity trend the damping trend and the forcing trend under increasing and decreasing initial conditions where applicable the vibration backbone is also included in fig 9 c again the nonlinear hardening behavior is observed as the velocity increases in fig 9 a so table 7 is presented to show the nonlinear coefficient considering only one mode as the impact speed decreases the b 1111 decreases accordingly also the deflection decreases as well because as the speed decreases the axial load decreases resulting in less load attributing to the deformation on the drone next the extreme boundary conditions of hinged hinged are investigated because the mode shapes change significantly for non geometric and material uniform beams with changing boundary conditions the shift in the nonlinearity is not as fluid as a uniform beam 6 3 2 hinged hinged marine drone configuration the hinged hinged boundary conditions are only considered for drone a to understand the general trend from one extreme boundary condition to the other in this study the forcing values of 1 4 7 and 10 n are considered with damping of 0 005 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 as was used with the clamped clamped case for drone a fig 10 a observes the nonlinear hardening effects with different speeds fig 10 b considers a variance on damping coefficient and fig 10 c investigates the variance on forcing excitation the hinged hinged case for drone a reveals deformations higher than the clamped clamped case for drone a as expected because there is a greater linear softening in the beam because the natural frequencies occur much lower due to the softening there is not a large change in frequency occurrences between the chosen speeds as is observed in fig 10 a therefore it is observed that a velocity of 8 m s will affect the same frequencies that are present for lower impact speeds a larger negative b 1111 coefficient also results in a stronger nonlinear hardening behavior contributing to the larger broadband and higher deflection found for the frequency response for drone a at 8 m s details on the nonlinear coefficient are listed in table 8 similar trends are found for increasing the forcing and damping in fig 10 c the nonlinearity effect of hardening is diminished due to the high damping that is chosen providing insight on how to control the nonlinear dynamics from creating nonlinear response during diving the extreme boundary conditions are explored next the observation on changing the boundary conditions from one extreme to the next and the stiffnesses in between are shown 6 3 3 understanding the stiffness variance effects on the survivability of the marine drone this section deeply explores the variance on the boundary stiffnesses because of the continuous beam s complex geometric and material properties the trend also becomes complex to observe the trend table 9 shows the buckling speed the linear natural frequency and the nonlinear coefficient that corresponds to the cubic nonlinearity of the system changing from hinged hinged to clamped clamped is straightforward for a symmetric uniform beam where the buckling speed and linear frequency increase accordingly the nonlinear coefficient decreases as the nonlinear hardening behavior is stronger for the hinged hinged case than the clamped clamped case while for geometric and material complex beams the trend of the buckling and linear frequency will portray a similar trend the nonlinear coefficient is not consistent since it is purely dependent on the mode shapes because the mode shape vary deeply due to the non uniform system table 9 reviews the nonlinear trend considering different stiffnesses for reference from the work of nayfeh and mook 2008 using perturbation techniques the response of the system depends on the nonlinear coefficient the natural frequency the damping coefficient the forcing frequency and the forcing amplitude as detailed in equation 23 because the nonlinear coefficient is influenced by many different variables the offset trend for a continuous beam with changing material and geometric parameters seems reasonable 31 ξ ω 1 2 ω ω 1 3 b 1111 q 1 2 8 ω 1 2 f 2 4 ω 1 2 q 1 2 according to table 9 if the stronger thicker beam is clamped essentially moving minimally compared with the thinner flexible beam then a familiar trend can be observed with the changing k 1 boundary condition from hinged to clamped where more hardening and more deflection is observed for the hinged condition because of this familiar trend the nonlinear frequency response is visually shown in fig 11 the plotted curves in this figure show the hardening to softening observation from hinged to clamped conditions at the impact speed of 8 m s and the damping factor of 0 1 fig 11 a b and 11 c consider the changing k 1 boundary condition when the force is set to 1 n 5 n and 10 n respectively the other observation to note with fig 11 is that as the forcing increases from 1 n to 10 n the hardening behavior appears more prominently the resonance broadband covers a larger frequency range and the deflection increases this hints that to promote drone survivability a smaller drone mass should be selected to decrease the total base excitation on the system if the base acceleration is out of the designer s control next a discussion is presented based off the observations that have been interpreted with the nonlinear frequency response recommendations for drone design are also discussed based off the estimated trends that were obtained from this current investigation 7 discussion and recommendations the size of the drone should be engineered with respect to the space needed for machine and electrical components as well as in accordance with the mission requirements extra space may be required to hold the components needed to perform wing folding wing and body compression and extension and propulsion in that case a thicker drone body width would need to be incorporated in which timoshenko modeling should then be used in place of euler bernoulli theory to obtain more accurate estimations a drone reduced to the mav size may be useful for maneuvering in and out of small spaces due to debris or brush obstruction a smaller sized drone may also provide other benefits due to its reduction in mass such as requiring less lift for flight to obtain higher rates of drone survivability increasing the speed of buckling would be helpful because then the drone can safely dive at higher speeds without significantly lowering its natural frequency as it does when it nears buckling for example if the drone systems a and b under clamped boundary conditions were set to dive at 20 m s then more nonlinear dynamic response could occur due to the natural frequency being close to zero at this velocity however if the buckling velocities were increased by either designing a more rigid neck from choosing a stronger material or including a strong frame then assigning a diving velocity near 20 m s would make the drone less likely to fail from material deformation or buckling an increase in forcing was found to increase the resonance bandwidth under drone applications a large broadband is not desired for drone design because this increases the range at which the drone could malfunction making it difficult to select an appropriate speed for a propeller or making it hard to avoid base excitation conversely increasing the damping reduces the hardening behavior and thus decreases not only the broadband region but also lowers the resonance amplitude lowering the chance of catastrophic behavior therefore when designing a drone high damping should be considered to reduce the effects from the forcing and nonlinearity which will help the drone withstand possible external sources of excitation noticeable effects occur on the nonlinear frequency response as the velocity varies increasing the velocity increases the axial load experienced on the system resulting in a lower natural frequency as observed in section 4 increasing the axial load appears to directly affect the nonlinearity of the system by increasing the bandwidth of the resonance region moreover with increasing initial conditions the resulting maximum deflection is also increased at higher impact velocities with these observations considering impact velocities well below the buckling speed might be useful in preventing buckling prediction error low natural frequencies and large resonance bands the boundary conditions of the drone when entering water should also be carefully selected to maximize the impact speed at which the drone will buckle clamped clamped conditions consistently show to not only increase the buckling speed but also decrease the deflection subjected to resonance and reduce the resonance broadband when compared with a hinged condition if possible near clamped clamped conditions should be employed based off the estimated response from this study however the exploration of other boundary conditions such as the cantilever condition could provide further insight on drone behavior during diving and may show to be the more appropriate choice for minimizing catastrophic behavior or buckling in summary to increase the survivability of the drone on a diving mission four drone design considerations should be reviewed first a large damper should be included to minimize the nonlinear characteristics of the system regardless of the external excitation applied second forcing from the excitation components should be minimized where reasonable to also reduce the hysteresis region minimizing the force from sources of base excitation without reducing a significant amount of acceleration can be accomplished with systems that have a smaller mass i e mavs third a much lower velocity than the buckling speed should be considered to avoid lower resonant frequencies and to also minimize the nonlinear effects drone systems with very high buckling speed characteristics are ideal so that a lower velocity can be chosen without compromising the effectiveness of the drone increasing the buckling speed characteristics would entail considering materials with a higher bending stiffness and thicker geometry as was demonstrated in zimmerman and abdelkefi 2020 other factors to consider are the half beak angle of the head the length and radius of the head and the length of the body which are also shown in zimmerman et al 2018 and zimmerman and abdelkefi 2020 fourth the boundary conditions should be chosen appropriately to minimize the nonlinearity effect the resonance region and the deflection of the drone during diving 8 conclusions this work investigated the effects the impact velocity damping external forcing amplitude and boundary conditions have on gannet inspired drones during diving euler bernoulli theory was utilized for model development using the extended hamilton s principle the equations of motion were derived galerkin discretization was applied to reduce the equations of motion to an ode to approximate the nonlinear dynamic response subjected to external excitation a convergence analysis was carried out to determine the required number of modes in the galerkin discretization to accurately estimate the system s response the general trend of how the drone behaved according to the changing parameters of forcing damping velocity and boundary conditions were studied offering an idea of how the drone may respond if not designed with careful consideration it was observed that the nonlinearity effect is more prominent with an increase in forcing and impact speed and a decrease in damping and boundary condition stiffnesses the nonlinearity effect if dominant increases the maximum deflection and increases the resonance broadband supplying the drone with a higher chance of encountering catastrophic behavior declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
20211,underwater explosion seriously affects the combat performance and vitality of submarines in order to improve the blast resistance of stiffened double cylindrical shells a new type of stiffened style that replaces the traditional t shaped stiffeners with circular tube stiffeners namely o shaped stiffeners are studied a series of comparative underwater explosion tests are carried out on two scaled stiffened double cylindrical shells with o and t shaped stiffeners based on the tests more detailed numerical simulations are made to explore the influence of the structure parameters on the shock performance of the whole structure it is shown that the o shaped stiffeners show more superior crushing performance than t shaped ones when the large plastic deformation appears on the shells as the plastic deformation of the t shaped stiffeners is dominated by harmonic buckling while that of the o shaped stiffeners is dominated by the flattening deformation of circular tubes the latter can produce greater plastic deformation and absorb more shock energy to reduce the internal energy of pressure hull and thin hull the shock response spectrums measuring at pressure hull can also be significantly attenuated at high frequency band therefore the o shaped stiffeners may be more effective sacrificial connected structures in the submarine keywords underwater explosion double cylindrical shells stiffeners shock response 1 introduction research on the strength of hull structures subjected to underwater explosive loadings is of significant importance in determining the bearing capacity of submarines underwater explosion rese 1950 klaseboer et al 2005 gong and lam 1999 shin 2004 zhang et al 2014 liang and tai 2006a stiffened double cylindrical shells is one of the main forms of submarine structures and mainly consists of three parts a pressure hull stiffeners and a thin hull the detonation of an explosive charge in water generates spherical shock waves the propagation path of shock loadings is as follows external water thin hull stiffeners in the gap of the double shells pressure hull equipment fig 1 guided by the propagation path of shock waves in the stiffened double cylindrical shells many methods have been proposed to defend against underwater explosion previous research which were paid widespread attentions mainly can be divided into two categories replacing the traditional steel plate by composite sandwich structures fleck and deshpande 2004 jin et al 2019a gauch et al 2018 xue and hutchinson 2003 and plastering a layer of sacrificial coatings on the ship hull chen et al 2009 jin et al 2019b leblanc and shukla 2014 leblanc et al 2015 xiao et al 2014 xue and hutchinson 2004 demonstrated that the potential for superior strength and energy absorbing capacity of the sandwich plates compared with solid plates having the same mass fan et al 2016 studied and analyzed the effects of key design parameters on blast resistance and failure mechanism of sandwich panels experimentally yin et al jin et al 2015 yin et al 2017 conducted a one dimensional analytical model to investigate the shock mitigation effects of double layer claddings and stepwise graded cellular claddings to underwater blasts they also analyzed the shock mitigation effects of sacrificial coatings for the stiffened double cylindrical shells yin et al 2020 however the stiffened structure on the transfer path of the shock loading has not received enough attention at present the research on blast resistance of stiffeners of submarines is still relatively rare in fact as the connecting structure of the pressure hull and the thin hull the stiffeners play an important role in ensuring the overall stiffness of the double cylindrical shell and absorbing shock energy under a severe underwater explosion event external water may flood in the submarine and threaten the safety of the entire submarine because of the damage of thin hull meanwhile the violent dynamic response of pressure shell will also affect the stability of the equipment in the cabin therefore the pressure hull and the thin hull should be safeguarded as a result using stiffeners as sacrificial structure to protect the thin hull and the pressure hull is necessary at this time wang and guo 2016 shahandeh and showkati 2016 in the past the traditional stiffener of the submarine is usually t shaped and consists of a web and a flange this structural form is simple to process but the bulking plastic deformation is more difficult to trigger besides its energy absorption capacity is limited showkati and shahandeh 2010 in summary it is particularly worth proposing a new form of stiffener which could generate large deformation easily and has more efficient energy absorption performance in recent years the impact resistance of tubular structures has been significantly developed baroutaji et al 2017 song et al 2012 zhao and abdennadher 2004 li et al 2020 mahdi and sebaey 2014 taher et al 2006 several investigations have been carried out to study the response of metallic tubes to explore their basic mechanism of deformation under lateral loads mutchler 1960 examined the behavior of an aluminum round tube when compressed laterally between two plates runtz and hodge deruntz and hodge 1963 carried out a limit analysis of the same problem by assuming that plastic hinges are formed at four locations at intersections of the horizontal and vertical axis in the tube cross section gupta et al 2005 obtained the deformation histories and load compression curves of round metallic tubes the effects of process parameters on the energy absorbing capacity of tubes are also discussed at same time liu et al 2017 investigated the mechanical responses and energy absorption capacities of aluminum foam filled and empty circular tubes experimentally and theoretically seyed et al elahi et al 2017 derived a theoretical model to predict energy absorption of empty and polyurethane foam filled tubes by correlating with actual experimental data the above research suggests that the circular thin walled structures have outstanding energy absorption capacity therefore the circular tubes have been widely used in the fields of vehicle collision and aerospace as energy absorbing elements wang et al 35 wang et al 2020 proposed a novel circular triangular nested tube energy absorber and revealed its deformation modes force displacement responses and energy absorption performance sun et al 36 sun et al 2016 performed experimental tests and simulation analysis of functionally graded tubes under bending loads the results demonstrate that a proper selection of thickness gradient can effectively enhance the energy absorption of tubal structures under transverse loading however there is no research on the application of circular tubes for underwater explosion protection based on the investigation of previous works replacing t shaped stiffeners with circular tubes o shaped stiffeners to may be an effective method to enhance the blast resistance of stiffened double cylindrical shells the objective of the present paper is to elaborate the blast advantage of this improvement measure the outline of this paper is as follows in section 2 the experimental procedure is first reported in section 3 the numerical model is established and the numerical results are compared with the experimental results to verify the validity of the numerical model by using the validated numerical models the effects of o shaped stiffeners on stiffened double cylindrical shells subjected to underwater blasts are discussed in section 4 finally concluding remarks are given in section 5 2 experimental specimens and setup 2 1 specimens in this paper underwater explosion tests have been conducted on two kinds of stiffened double cylindrical shells with different shaped stiffeners between inner pressure hull and outer thin hull the geometry and dimension of testing specimens are shown in fig 2 the length outer diameter and inner diameter of the stiffened double cylindrical shells are 1500 mm 1400 mm and 1200 mm respectively there exist 14 same stiffeners in the gap equally spaced with a distance of 100 mm fig 2 also gives the sketches of the t shaped stiffener and the o shaped stiffener all the parts of the shells are made of q345 low carbon steel and the thicknesses of the pressure hull stiffener and thin hull are 6 mm 3 mm and 3 mm respectively the masses of the o shaped and t shaped stiffened shells were 923 kg and 915 kg and the relative difference value was 0 88 the two specimens have almost same weight which could be seen as the basis of the comparison 2 2 experimental setup the underwater explosion tests were carried out in a lake which is approximately 15 m in depth and 60 m in diameter to minimize the influence of reflected shock waves as much as possible the experimental system of the underwater explosion tests is schematically shown in fig 3 the stiffened double cylindrical shells were placed horizontally with half immersed in water and four corner points of the hull are suspended on the supporting beam by connecting ropes the underwater explosive charge tnt indicated by the black star is located right under the central position of the double cylindrical shells in vertical direction and the stand off distance is determined according to the designed testing cases a pressure transducer pcb 138a25 is placed 3 6 m away from the explosion source in horizontal direction to monitor the free field pressure in water the physical experiment setup can be seen in fig 4 two different stand off distance values were adopted during the tests and the details of testing cases are listed in table 1 all the accelerations sensors and bidirectional strain gauges are installed inside the pressure hull to monitor the dynamic response in the underwater explosion tests fig 5 three vertical accelerometers a1 a2 a3 were located directly above the stiffeners three strain gauges e1 e2 e3 were arranged between stiffeners to give the circumferential and axial strains during underwater explosion events the specific distribution of all measuring points is also shown in fig 5 the sampling frequency of all measuring points is 50 khz 3 numerical model and verification the dynamic responses of double cylindrical shells with different kinds of stiffeners under explosion are also simulated by abaqus explicit software the experimental results and simulation results are compared to verify the accuracy of the finite element model 3 1 finite element model in this paper the acoustic structural coupling method is employed to compute the dynamic responses of stiffened double cylindrical shells subjected to far field noncontact underwater explosion because of symmetry only a quarter of the specimen was modeled symmetric boundary conditions for the x z and y z planes were imposed the whole finite element model shown in fig 6 consists of two parts stiffened double cylindrical shells and external water the geometry and dimensions of the structural finite element model were the same with the experimental specimens reduced integration points shell element sr4 is used for the shells and the ac3d8r element is used for the external fluid fig 7 gives the numerical models of two kind stiffened double cylindrical shells the external fluid has a bulk modulus of 2 13e9 pa and a sound speed of 1500 m s the stiffened shells were modeled with element of 5 mm to ensure at least 20 elements on the section of circular stiffener the mesh density is sparse gradually from the double cylindrical shells to the edge of external water the meshes are measured 5 mm at the fluid structure interface but 45 mm at the outer surface the boundary condition of the outer fluid element was set as a non reflective boundary during analysis the free surface of the water has a pressure boundary of atmosphere pressure equal to 0 101 mpa the structure water interactions were implemented using a surface based tie constraint the material of stiffened double cylindrical shells is low carbon steel q345 the plastic deformation of the structure appears in an extreme short time thus the strain rate effect of material must be considered in this study cowper symonds constitutive model is employed to calculate the flow stress cowper and symonds 1957 the relationship between the flow stress and the strain rate can be described as 1 σ d y σ y 1 ε d 1 n where σ d y denotes the dynamic yield stress σ y denotes the static yield stress and d n represent the strain rate parameters of the material jones 2011 the material properties of the stiffened double cylindrical shell are given in table 2 according to the survey of symonds the strain rate sensitivity model provides a reasonably good representation of test results up to strain rate of 1000 s 1 symonds 1967 3 2 shocking load according to cole 1948 marine structures are exposed to two types of loads shock wave and bubble pulsation in the initial stage of the explosion the charge instantly converts into a hot explosion gas and induces a shock wave with its peak pressure up to 5000 mpa the shock wave propagates spherically in the surrounding water and is superimposed with the hydrostatic pressure most cases demonstrated that the shock wave contributes to the damage on marine structures occurs in the early stage of the underwater explosion this paper only considers the effects of the shock wave the explosion energy is a function of the charge weight and stand off distance the pressure time history at any location has an instantaneous pressure increase followed by a decay which can be approximated by an exponential function the far field shock wave pressure profiles can be presented as 2 p r t p c a c r 1 a f a c r b v c t a c where r is the distance from the explosive charge with radius a c the parameters p c v c a and b are constants associated with the charge material two choices for f τ are 3 f τ e τ τ 1 f τ 0 8251 e 1 338 τ 0 1749 e 0 1805 τ 1 τ 7 during underwater explosion events two types of cavitation may occur bulk cavitation and local cavitation wu et al 2020 the former is caused by the reflection of the shock wave at free surface and the latter occurs when the shock wave strikes on the flexible structure of double cylindrical shells both of them cannot be ignored in this paper when the underwater shock wave impinges upon a flexible structure the absolute pressure at the fluid structure interface may be negative because of the negative scattered pressure however the water cannot sustain tension local cavitation will occur in water as the pressure drops to the vapor pressure then the cavitation bubble will collapse and reload on the structure in the finite element model the total wave formulation was adopted and the cavitation was generated using the cavitation limit and initial conditions a linearly varying initial hydrostatic pressure in the fluid and the cavitation limit are specified to consider the local cavitation the constitutive behavior for an acoustic medium capable of undergoing cavitation can be stated as 4 p max p v p c p 0 where p v is the pseudo pressure of the fluid particle p c is the fluid cavitation limit and p 0 is the initial acoustic static pressure the measured shock wave and the predicted pressure using a single exponential fit and a double exponential fit are compared in fig 8 a the double exponential fit pressure is in good agreement with measured pressure not only in the peak value but also in the decay trend therefore the double exponential fit is employed in the following analysis to give the incident shock wave the calculated corresponding incident shock wave profile is shown in fig 8 b 3 3 comparisons between experimental results and numerical simulations in order to verify the reliability and accuracy of the finite element model the numerical simulation results are analyzed in three ways the absolute pressure in the external water the deformation mode of stiffened double cylindrical shells and the dynamic response of the measuring points on the pressure hull fig 9 shows the absolute pressure in the fluid field during the numerical simulation process at various times for designed case no 3 in the initial stage the underwater explosion shock wave propagates spherically firstly reaches the thin hull of cylindrical shells impinges on the flexible structure and generates a reflected wave therefore the local cavitation occurs in water as the pressure drops to the vapor pressure approximately 0 3 psi in fig 9 b at the same time on both sides of the double cylindrical shells the shock wave continued propagating until arriving at the free surface a large region of bulk cavitation is generated fig 9 d after that the two cavitation areas continue expanding to the critical boundaries fig 9 e but then gradually shrank its size because of the hydrostatic pressure finally the two cavitation areas collapsed and reload on the structure inducing the second dynamic response of structures in summary the propagation of the shock wave in external water is in line with the previous understanding of the underwater explosion fig 10 shows the results of the plastic deformation of the experimental model and the numerical model after underwater explosion the pressure hull is basically unchanged before and after underwater explosion while some slight periodic hollows appear on the thin hull especially at the middle area of the structure the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental results fig 11 compared the experimental data and numerical data of the maximum circumferential and axial strains of measuring points the peak values of the axial strains on the pressure shell is far greater than that of the circumferential strains the no matter in which direction the numerical results are very close to the experimental results by comparing the deformation mode and the deformation degree of the structure it can be seen that the test and the numerical simulation maintain a high degree of consistency the dynamic shock response results of the measuring points on the pressure hull are directly related to the harshness of the impact environment of the equipment in the cabin fig 12 a compared the tested and simulated velocity histories on the measuring point a1 when the stand off distance is 4 4 m good agreement for both the peak velocity and the velocity profile are observed the velocity of point a1 achieves its maximum value within 3 ms during which the high pressure shock wave plays a significant role after that the shell oscillates freely to zero with the rapid attenuation of the shock wave the error of peak values is 7 69 which is within the allowable range the shock response spectrum is the description of the impact response of the structure in frequency domain parzianello et al 2010 botta and cerri 2007 it can quantify the severity of the impact in the frequency domain and parameterize the severity of the impact environment comparisons of the shock response spectrums between simulation results and test results is given in fig 12 b the two curves keep basically same in the whole frequency domain there exists a little difference at the low frequency band because of the zero drift phenomenon occurred during the measurement all above comparisons verify the feasibility and acceptable accuracy of the numerical simulation model 4 results and discussions the verified numerical model is used to conduct a series of simulations to compare the dynamic response of double cylindrical shells with t shaped stiffeners and o shaped stiffeners respectively the advantageous shock resistance of circular tube stiffeners is presented by these simulations in this section the comparisons and discussions are from four perspectives the deformation modes of two kind stiffeners the shock environment analysis the performance of the energy absorption and the effect of the thickness of stiffeners the configurations are detailed listed in table 3 comparisons of configuration 1 8 will explain whether using o shaped stiffeners can improve the blast resistance of the structure and how the o shaped stiffener works the hull shock factor hsf liang and tai 2006b is employed to describe intensity of the shock wave the hsf is determined as 5 c h s f m r where m is the weight of explosion in tnt equivalence kg r is the stand off distance from the charge to the target m in this study the hsf is set to be 0 119 0 227 0 461 and 0 595 respectively for each hsf the simulations of t and o shaped stiffened double cylindrical shells are conducted finally the energy absorption capacity of o shaped stiffeners is intrinsically related to its thickness the thickness ratio is the ratio between the thickness of stiffeners to that of the thin hull therefore configurations 8 10 are conducted to explore how the thickness affects the blast resistance of double cylindrical shells 4 1 deformation mode fig 13 shows the equivalent plastic strain peeq results of t and o shaped stiffened cylindrical shells after impact for case no 1 and 2 when the shock factor is 0 119 the peak pressure of the shock wave is 4 73 mpa and the strength is not enough to generate obvious plastic deformation of the double cylindrical shells the max peeqs of double cylindrical shells are 4 08 10 3 and 4 1 10 3 plastic deformations are distributed on the thin hull at this time neither t nor o shaped stiffeners generate large deformation the energy absorption capacity of the o shaped stiffener is not exerted yet fig 14 shows the equivalent plastic deformation results of t and o shaped stiffened cylindrical shells after impact for case no 7 and 8 when the shock factor is 0 595 the peak of the shock wave reaches 15 9 mpa the max peeqs of double cylindrical shells are 1 33 10 1and 1 48 10 1 which means large deformation appear on the double cylindrical shells compared with fig 13 the plastic deformations appear not only on the thin hull but also on the stiffeners in fig 14 the stiffeners are involved in absorbing the shock energy focusing on the stiffeners different deformation modes of the t and o shaped stiffeners are observed and given in fig 15 the tube of the o shaped stiffener was gradually flattened to an oval by the shock loading and the plastic strain was mainly distributed in the four symmetrical points of the cross section of the tube however the t shaped stiffener shows a completely different deformation mode the t shaped stiffener exhibits a harmonic buckling around the central point as a balance point the max plastic deformation mainly locates at the peak and valley of the harmonic the axial and circumferential strain histories of measuring point e1 on the pressure hull with a shock factor of 0 595 are plotted in fig 16 both the circumferential and axial strains of t and o shaped stiffened hulls rapidly rise to their maximum values in the initial stage after the transient oscillation the circumferential and axial strains attenuate to stable values that is the plastic strains of the measuring point the circumferential plastic strain of e1 of o shaped shells was 2200 μ ε which was much larger than the axial plastic strain 611 μ ε it is obvious that both the maximum absolute value and stable absolute value substantially decreased when the t shaped stiffeners are changed to o shaped stiffeners the results show that the o shaped stiffener can alleviate the plastic deformation of the pressure hull and protect the internal equipment 4 2 shock environment analysis the shock environment of the submarine is an important indicator to describe its blast resistance the peak values of the acceleration of the measuring points for four hsfs are shown in table 4 when the hsfs are 0 119 and 0 227 it is obviously that the maximum acceleration for o stiffened shells is much smaller than the t stiffened shells the same trend of accelerations was observed in the testing and fem results compared with the t shaped stiffeners the reduction rates of peak accelerations of shells with o shaped stiffeners are over 19 for hsf 0 119 and 0 227 and 43 for hsf 0 461 and 0 595 therefore using circular tubes as stiffeners plays a more prominent role in decreasing the peak accelerations of structures in time domain the comparison of the shock response spectrums of measuring points of the two kind stiffened structures is shown in fig 17 and fig 18 when the hull shock factor is 0 119 there exists no obvious difference of the shock response spectrums between two stiffened structures in the whole frequency domain this is because there exists no water in the gap between the pressure hull and the thin hull the shock waves cannot impinge on the pressure hull directly and the shock loading must transfer through stiffeners the strength of the shock wave is not enough to make the stiffened double cylindrical shells generate large deformation and the deformation areas are mainly distributed on the thin hull however when the hull shock factor increases to a certain extent such as 0 595 large deformations appear in the structure replacing t shaped stiffeners with o shaped stiffeners does not change the low frequency modals of hulls but changes the local modals at high frequency band reflected in the impact spectrum comparison the shock response spectrums of the two hulls are basically the same at low and middle frequency bands but at the high frequency band the shock environment of o shaped stiffened double cylindrical shells is significantly reduced compared with that of t shaped stiffened double cylindrical shells the results illustrate that the o shaped stiffeners in the hulls play the key role in improve the dynamic response of the pressure hull at the high frequency band 4 3 performance of energy absorption the histories of the internal energy of each part of two stiffened double cylindrical shells are presented in fig 19 when the hsf is 0 119 both the peak internal energy and profile of t stiffened shells and o stiffened shells are very close fig 19 a the internal energy attenuates to zero finally indicated internal energy of the pressure hull is mainly the elastic deformation energy in contrast to the pressure hull the internal energy of the thin hull attenuates to a stable value fig 19 c which means slight plastic deformation appears on the thin hull besides the elastic deformation this character is in good agreement with the deformation mode shown in fig 13 the t shaped stiffeners and o shaped stiffeners do not represent obvious divergence in energy absorbing capacity for the hsf 0 119 in fig 19 e when the hsf is 0 595 the histories of the internal energy of the pressure hull of two stiffened shells are shown in fig 19 b the maximum and stable internal energy of the pressure hull significantly decreased by 12 and 11 6 respectively because of o shaped stiffeners the similar phenomenon also appears on the thin hull in fig 19 d compared with the t shaped stiffeners the maximum and stable internal energy of o shaped stiffeners increased by 117 and 57 which demonstrates that the o shaped stiffeners have a more superior elastic and plastic deformation energy capacity than t shaped stiffeners the above discussions reveal that part of the internal energy of the pressure hull and the thin hull transfers to the o shaped stiffeners the o shaped stiffener can be seen as a sacrificial structure in shells to protect the pressure hull and the thin hull 4 4 effects of thickness ratio the energy absorbing capacity of thin walled tubes is related closely to its thickness the thickness ratio is defined as the ratio between the thickness of the o shaped stiffener to that of the thin hull in this study using the finite element model described above the numerical simulations case no 7 10 are undertaken to analyze the effects of thickness ratios on the blast resistance of shells if the thickness of the o shaped stiffener is similar to that of the thin hull the large deformation tends to appear on the thin hull but not on the o shaped stiffeners the superior energy absorbing capacity of the o shaped stiffener cannot be brought into play therefore thinning the o shaped stiffeners and thicken the thin hull to keep total mass of the stiffened double cylindrical shells unchanging is necessary fig 20 gives the simulated equivalent plastic strain results of hulls with different thickness ratios obvious periodic hollows appear on the thin hull and the max peeq value is 0 0622 when the thickness ratio is 1 0 in fig 20 a in fig 20 d almost all the plastic deformations concentrate on the o shaped stiffeners and the max peeq value is 0 1445 when the thickness ratio is 0 375 it shows that the large plastic deformation gradually migrates to the o shaped stiffeners with the thickness ratio decreased from 1 0 to 0 375 but the max peeq value increased decreasing the thickness ratios will change the plastic deformation mode of stiffened double cylindrical shells it is helpful to concentrate plastic areas on stiffeners fig 021 compared the shock response spectrums of measuring points a1 and a2 of stiffened shells with graded thickness ratios with the decreasing of the thickness ratios the dynamic responses remain essentially unchanged at the low frequency band but decreased significantly at the high frequency band especially beyond 2 khz the results indicate that decreasing the thickness ratios is helpful to suppress the dynamic response of pressure hull at the high frequency band in addition fig 022 compared the internal energy changes of the each part of the stiffened shells with different thickness ratios the time histories of the internal energy have similar profiles but significantly distinct amplitudes with decreasing of thickness ratios from 1 to 0 375 the plastic deformation energy of the pressure hull and the thin shell decreased by 33 5 and 32 9 respectively while that of the o shaped stiffeners increased by 486 8 a part of the plastic deformation energy of the pressure hull and the thin shell transferred to the o shaped stiffeners the results suggest that thinner o shaped stiffeners can absorb more shock energy this is because the plastic deformation of the thinner stiffeners is easier to trigger the above research indicates that stiffened shells with smaller thickness ratios have a better blast resistance however the thickness of stiffeners cannot be reduced without a limit and the balance should be considered from more aspects 5 conclusions in this paper the underwater blast resistance of double cylindrical shells with two types of stiffeners were investigated experimentally and numerically a series of comparative live fire tests were made on two scaled cabin models one with t shaped stiffeners and the other with o shaped stiffeners a detailed numerical analysis on the shock responses of the models is made using abaqus explicit in order to explore the difference between the energy absorption characteristics of two types of stiffeners it can be concluded that 1 replacing traditional t shaped stiffeners with o shaped stiffeners is helpful to reduce the dynamic response of the shell when subjected to intensive shock loading at high frequency band it is also conducive to diminish the plastic strain of the pressure hull if large plastic deformation appears on the stiffened double cylindrical shells 2 when compressed by shock loading the plastic deformation mode of t shaped stiffeners is harmonic bulking around the central point and the maximum plastic strain is located at the peak and valley of the harmonic the plastic deformation mode of o shaped stiffeners is that the tube was gradually flattened to an oval and the plastic strain is mainly distributed on the four symmetrical points of the cross section of the tube 3 when the shock factor is 0 595 the internal energy of the pressure hull can be reduced by 12 while that of stiffeners increased by 117 after replacing t shaped stiffeners with o shaped stiffeners as a sacrificial structure the o shaped stiffener can absorb more shock energy to protect the pressure hull and the thin hull 4 the ratio between thickness of o shaped stiffeners to that of the thin hull could directly affect the blast resistance of stiffened double cylindrical shells when the thickness ratio decreases from 1 0 to 0 375 the plastic deformation of o shaped stiffeners triggered easily the dynamic response of the pressure hull decreased at the high frequency band the internal energy of the pressure hull and the thin hull can be reduced by 33 5 and 32 9 respectively and while that of stiffeners increased by 486 8 credit authorship contribution statement shizhang huang

20211,underwater explosion seriously affects the combat performance and vitality of submarines in order to improve the blast resistance of stiffened double cylindrical shells a new type of stiffened style that replaces the traditional t shaped stiffeners with circular tube stiffeners namely o shaped stiffeners are studied a series of comparative underwater explosion tests are carried out on two scaled stiffened double cylindrical shells with o and t shaped stiffeners based on the tests more detailed numerical simulations are made to explore the influence of the structure parameters on the shock performance of the whole structure it is shown that the o shaped stiffeners show more superior crushing performance than t shaped ones when the large plastic deformation appears on the shells as the plastic deformation of the t shaped stiffeners is dominated by harmonic buckling while that of the o shaped stiffeners is dominated by the flattening deformation of circular tubes the latter can produce greater plastic deformation and absorb more shock energy to reduce the internal energy of pressure hull and thin hull the shock response spectrums measuring at pressure hull can also be significantly attenuated at high frequency band therefore the o shaped stiffeners may be more effective sacrificial connected structures in the submarine keywords underwater explosion double cylindrical shells stiffeners shock response 1 introduction research on the strength of hull structures subjected to underwater explosive loadings is of significant importance in determining the bearing capacity of submarines underwater explosion rese 1950 klaseboer et al 2005 gong and lam 1999 shin 2004 zhang et al 2014 liang and tai 2006a stiffened double cylindrical shells is one of the main forms of submarine structures and mainly consists of three parts a pressure hull stiffeners and a thin hull the detonation of an explosive charge in water generates spherical shock waves the propagation path of shock loadings is as follows external water thin hull stiffeners in the gap of the double shells pressure hull equipment fig 1 guided by the propagation path of shock waves in the stiffened double cylindrical shells many methods have been proposed to defend against underwater explosion previous research which were paid widespread attentions mainly can be divided into two categories replacing the traditional steel plate by composite sandwich structures fleck and deshpande 2004 jin et al 2019a gauch et al 2018 xue and hutchinson 2003 and plastering a layer of sacrificial coatings on the ship hull chen et al 2009 jin et al 2019b leblanc and shukla 2014 leblanc et al 2015 xiao et al 2014 xue and hutchinson 2004 demonstrated that the potential for superior strength and energy absorbing capacity of the sandwich plates compared with solid plates having the same mass fan et al 2016 studied and analyzed the effects of key design parameters on blast resistance and failure mechanism of sandwich panels experimentally yin et al jin et al 2015 yin et al 2017 conducted a one dimensional analytical model to investigate the shock mitigation effects of double layer claddings and stepwise graded cellular claddings to underwater blasts they also analyzed the shock mitigation effects of sacrificial coatings for the stiffened double cylindrical shells yin et al 2020 however the stiffened structure on the transfer path of the shock loading has not received enough attention at present the research on blast resistance of stiffeners of submarines is still relatively rare in fact as the connecting structure of the pressure hull and the thin hull the stiffeners play an important role in ensuring the overall stiffness of the double cylindrical shell and absorbing shock energy under a severe underwater explosion event external water may flood in the submarine and threaten the safety of the entire submarine because of the damage of thin hull meanwhile the violent dynamic response of pressure shell will also affect the stability of the equipment in the cabin therefore the pressure hull and the thin hull should be safeguarded as a result using stiffeners as sacrificial structure to protect the thin hull and the pressure hull is necessary at this time wang and guo 2016 shahandeh and showkati 2016 in the past the traditional stiffener of the submarine is usually t shaped and consists of a web and a flange this structural form is simple to process but the bulking plastic deformation is more difficult to trigger besides its energy absorption capacity is limited showkati and shahandeh 2010 in summary it is particularly worth proposing a new form of stiffener which could generate large deformation easily and has more efficient energy absorption performance in recent years the impact resistance of tubular structures has been significantly developed baroutaji et al 2017 song et al 2012 zhao and abdennadher 2004 li et al 2020 mahdi and sebaey 2014 taher et al 2006 several investigations have been carried out to study the response of metallic tubes to explore their basic mechanism of deformation under lateral loads mutchler 1960 examined the behavior of an aluminum round tube when compressed laterally between two plates runtz and hodge deruntz and hodge 1963 carried out a limit analysis of the same problem by assuming that plastic hinges are formed at four locations at intersections of the horizontal and vertical axis in the tube cross section gupta et al 2005 obtained the deformation histories and load compression curves of round metallic tubes the effects of process parameters on the energy absorbing capacity of tubes are also discussed at same time liu et al 2017 investigated the mechanical responses and energy absorption capacities of aluminum foam filled and empty circular tubes experimentally and theoretically seyed et al elahi et al 2017 derived a theoretical model to predict energy absorption of empty and polyurethane foam filled tubes by correlating with actual experimental data the above research suggests that the circular thin walled structures have outstanding energy absorption capacity therefore the circular tubes have been widely used in the fields of vehicle collision and aerospace as energy absorbing elements wang et al 35 wang et al 2020 proposed a novel circular triangular nested tube energy absorber and revealed its deformation modes force displacement responses and energy absorption performance sun et al 36 sun et al 2016 performed experimental tests and simulation analysis of functionally graded tubes under bending loads the results demonstrate that a proper selection of thickness gradient can effectively enhance the energy absorption of tubal structures under transverse loading however there is no research on the application of circular tubes for underwater explosion protection based on the investigation of previous works replacing t shaped stiffeners with circular tubes o shaped stiffeners to may be an effective method to enhance the blast resistance of stiffened double cylindrical shells the objective of the present paper is to elaborate the blast advantage of this improvement measure the outline of this paper is as follows in section 2 the experimental procedure is first reported in section 3 the numerical model is established and the numerical results are compared with the experimental results to verify the validity of the numerical model by using the validated numerical models the effects of o shaped stiffeners on stiffened double cylindrical shells subjected to underwater blasts are discussed in section 4 finally concluding remarks are given in section 5 2 experimental specimens and setup 2 1 specimens in this paper underwater explosion tests have been conducted on two kinds of stiffened double cylindrical shells with different shaped stiffeners between inner pressure hull and outer thin hull the geometry and dimension of testing specimens are shown in fig 2 the length outer diameter and inner diameter of the stiffened double cylindrical shells are 1500 mm 1400 mm and 1200 mm respectively there exist 14 same stiffeners in the gap equally spaced with a distance of 100 mm fig 2 also gives the sketches of the t shaped stiffener and the o shaped stiffener all the parts of the shells are made of q345 low carbon steel and the thicknesses of the pressure hull stiffener and thin hull are 6 mm 3 mm and 3 mm respectively the masses of the o shaped and t shaped stiffened shells were 923 kg and 915 kg and the relative difference value was 0 88 the two specimens have almost same weight which could be seen as the basis of the comparison 2 2 experimental setup the underwater explosion tests were carried out in a lake which is approximately 15 m in depth and 60 m in diameter to minimize the influence of reflected shock waves as much as possible the experimental system of the underwater explosion tests is schematically shown in fig 3 the stiffened double cylindrical shells were placed horizontally with half immersed in water and four corner points of the hull are suspended on the supporting beam by connecting ropes the underwater explosive charge tnt indicated by the black star is located right under the central position of the double cylindrical shells in vertical direction and the stand off distance is determined according to the designed testing cases a pressure transducer pcb 138a25 is placed 3 6 m away from the explosion source in horizontal direction to monitor the free field pressure in water the physical experiment setup can be seen in fig 4 two different stand off distance values were adopted during the tests and the details of testing cases are listed in table 1 all the accelerations sensors and bidirectional strain gauges are installed inside the pressure hull to monitor the dynamic response in the underwater explosion tests fig 5 three vertical accelerometers a1 a2 a3 were located directly above the stiffeners three strain gauges e1 e2 e3 were arranged between stiffeners to give the circumferential and axial strains during underwater explosion events the specific distribution of all measuring points is also shown in fig 5 the sampling frequency of all measuring points is 50 khz 3 numerical model and verification the dynamic responses of double cylindrical shells with different kinds of stiffeners under explosion are also simulated by abaqus explicit software the experimental results and simulation results are compared to verify the accuracy of the finite element model 3 1 finite element model in this paper the acoustic structural coupling method is employed to compute the dynamic responses of stiffened double cylindrical shells subjected to far field noncontact underwater explosion because of symmetry only a quarter of the specimen was modeled symmetric boundary conditions for the x z and y z planes were imposed the whole finite element model shown in fig 6 consists of two parts stiffened double cylindrical shells and external water the geometry and dimensions of the structural finite element model were the same with the experimental specimens reduced integration points shell element sr4 is used for the shells and the ac3d8r element is used for the external fluid fig 7 gives the numerical models of two kind stiffened double cylindrical shells the external fluid has a bulk modulus of 2 13e9 pa and a sound speed of 1500 m s the stiffened shells were modeled with element of 5 mm to ensure at least 20 elements on the section of circular stiffener the mesh density is sparse gradually from the double cylindrical shells to the edge of external water the meshes are measured 5 mm at the fluid structure interface but 45 mm at the outer surface the boundary condition of the outer fluid element was set as a non reflective boundary during analysis the free surface of the water has a pressure boundary of atmosphere pressure equal to 0 101 mpa the structure water interactions were implemented using a surface based tie constraint the material of stiffened double cylindrical shells is low carbon steel q345 the plastic deformation of the structure appears in an extreme short time thus the strain rate effect of material must be considered in this study cowper symonds constitutive model is employed to calculate the flow stress cowper and symonds 1957 the relationship between the flow stress and the strain rate can be described as 1 σ d y σ y 1 ε d 1 n where σ d y denotes the dynamic yield stress σ y denotes the static yield stress and d n represent the strain rate parameters of the material jones 2011 the material properties of the stiffened double cylindrical shell are given in table 2 according to the survey of symonds the strain rate sensitivity model provides a reasonably good representation of test results up to strain rate of 1000 s 1 symonds 1967 3 2 shocking load according to cole 1948 marine structures are exposed to two types of loads shock wave and bubble pulsation in the initial stage of the explosion the charge instantly converts into a hot explosion gas and induces a shock wave with its peak pressure up to 5000 mpa the shock wave propagates spherically in the surrounding water and is superimposed with the hydrostatic pressure most cases demonstrated that the shock wave contributes to the damage on marine structures occurs in the early stage of the underwater explosion this paper only considers the effects of the shock wave the explosion energy is a function of the charge weight and stand off distance the pressure time history at any location has an instantaneous pressure increase followed by a decay which can be approximated by an exponential function the far field shock wave pressure profiles can be presented as 2 p r t p c a c r 1 a f a c r b v c t a c where r is the distance from the explosive charge with radius a c the parameters p c v c a and b are constants associated with the charge material two choices for f τ are 3 f τ e τ τ 1 f τ 0 8251 e 1 338 τ 0 1749 e 0 1805 τ 1 τ 7 during underwater explosion events two types of cavitation may occur bulk cavitation and local cavitation wu et al 2020 the former is caused by the reflection of the shock wave at free surface and the latter occurs when the shock wave strikes on the flexible structure of double cylindrical shells both of them cannot be ignored in this paper when the underwater shock wave impinges upon a flexible structure the absolute pressure at the fluid structure interface may be negative because of the negative scattered pressure however the water cannot sustain tension local cavitation will occur in water as the pressure drops to the vapor pressure then the cavitation bubble will collapse and reload on the structure in the finite element model the total wave formulation was adopted and the cavitation was generated using the cavitation limit and initial conditions a linearly varying initial hydrostatic pressure in the fluid and the cavitation limit are specified to consider the local cavitation the constitutive behavior for an acoustic medium capable of undergoing cavitation can be stated as 4 p max p v p c p 0 where p v is the pseudo pressure of the fluid particle p c is the fluid cavitation limit and p 0 is the initial acoustic static pressure the measured shock wave and the predicted pressure using a single exponential fit and a double exponential fit are compared in fig 8 a the double exponential fit pressure is in good agreement with measured pressure not only in the peak value but also in the decay trend therefore the double exponential fit is employed in the following analysis to give the incident shock wave the calculated corresponding incident shock wave profile is shown in fig 8 b 3 3 comparisons between experimental results and numerical simulations in order to verify the reliability and accuracy of the finite element model the numerical simulation results are analyzed in three ways the absolute pressure in the external water the deformation mode of stiffened double cylindrical shells and the dynamic response of the measuring points on the pressure hull fig 9 shows the absolute pressure in the fluid field during the numerical simulation process at various times for designed case no 3 in the initial stage the underwater explosion shock wave propagates spherically firstly reaches the thin hull of cylindrical shells impinges on the flexible structure and generates a reflected wave therefore the local cavitation occurs in water as the pressure drops to the vapor pressure approximately 0 3 psi in fig 9 b at the same time on both sides of the double cylindrical shells the shock wave continued propagating until arriving at the free surface a large region of bulk cavitation is generated fig 9 d after that the two cavitation areas continue expanding to the critical boundaries fig 9 e but then gradually shrank its size because of the hydrostatic pressure finally the two cavitation areas collapsed and reload on the structure inducing the second dynamic response of structures in summary the propagation of the shock wave in external water is in line with the previous understanding of the underwater explosion fig 10 shows the results of the plastic deformation of the experimental model and the numerical model after underwater explosion the pressure hull is basically unchanged before and after underwater explosion while some slight periodic hollows appear on the thin hull especially at the middle area of the structure the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental results fig 11 compared the experimental data and numerical data of the maximum circumferential and axial strains of measuring points the peak values of the axial strains on the pressure shell is far greater than that of the circumferential strains the no matter in which direction the numerical results are very close to the experimental results by comparing the deformation mode and the deformation degree of the structure it can be seen that the test and the numerical simulation maintain a high degree of consistency the dynamic shock response results of the measuring points on the pressure hull are directly related to the harshness of the impact environment of the equipment in the cabin fig 12 a compared the tested and simulated velocity histories on the measuring point a1 when the stand off distance is 4 4 m good agreement for both the peak velocity and the velocity profile are observed the velocity of point a1 achieves its maximum value within 3 ms during which the high pressure shock wave plays a significant role after that the shell oscillates freely to zero with the rapid attenuation of the shock wave the error of peak values is 7 69 which is within the allowable range the shock response spectrum is the description of the impact response of the structure in frequency domain parzianello et al 2010 botta and cerri 2007 it can quantify the severity of the impact in the frequency domain and parameterize the severity of the impact environment comparisons of the shock response spectrums between simulation results and test results is given in fig 12 b the two curves keep basically same in the whole frequency domain there exists a little difference at the low frequency band because of the zero drift phenomenon occurred during the measurement all above comparisons verify the feasibility and acceptable accuracy of the numerical simulation model 4 results and discussions the verified numerical model is used to conduct a series of simulations to compare the dynamic response of double cylindrical shells with t shaped stiffeners and o shaped stiffeners respectively the advantageous shock resistance of circular tube stiffeners is presented by these simulations in this section the comparisons and discussions are from four perspectives the deformation modes of two kind stiffeners the shock environment analysis the performance of the energy absorption and the effect of the thickness of stiffeners the configurations are detailed listed in table 3 comparisons of configuration 1 8 will explain whether using o shaped stiffeners can improve the blast resistance of the structure and how the o shaped stiffener works the hull shock factor hsf liang and tai 2006b is employed to describe intensity of the shock wave the hsf is determined as 5 c h s f m r where m is the weight of explosion in tnt equivalence kg r is the stand off distance from the charge to the target m in this study the hsf is set to be 0 119 0 227 0 461 and 0 595 respectively for each hsf the simulations of t and o shaped stiffened double cylindrical shells are conducted finally the energy absorption capacity of o shaped stiffeners is intrinsically related to its thickness the thickness ratio is the ratio between the thickness of stiffeners to that of the thin hull therefore configurations 8 10 are conducted to explore how the thickness affects the blast resistance of double cylindrical shells 4 1 deformation mode fig 13 shows the equivalent plastic strain peeq results of t and o shaped stiffened cylindrical shells after impact for case no 1 and 2 when the shock factor is 0 119 the peak pressure of the shock wave is 4 73 mpa and the strength is not enough to generate obvious plastic deformation of the double cylindrical shells the max peeqs of double cylindrical shells are 4 08 10 3 and 4 1 10 3 plastic deformations are distributed on the thin hull at this time neither t nor o shaped stiffeners generate large deformation the energy absorption capacity of the o shaped stiffener is not exerted yet fig 14 shows the equivalent plastic deformation results of t and o shaped stiffened cylindrical shells after impact for case no 7 and 8 when the shock factor is 0 595 the peak of the shock wave reaches 15 9 mpa the max peeqs of double cylindrical shells are 1 33 10 1and 1 48 10 1 which means large deformation appear on the double cylindrical shells compared with fig 13 the plastic deformations appear not only on the thin hull but also on the stiffeners in fig 14 the stiffeners are involved in absorbing the shock energy focusing on the stiffeners different deformation modes of the t and o shaped stiffeners are observed and given in fig 15 the tube of the o shaped stiffener was gradually flattened to an oval by the shock loading and the plastic strain was mainly distributed in the four symmetrical points of the cross section of the tube however the t shaped stiffener shows a completely different deformation mode the t shaped stiffener exhibits a harmonic buckling around the central point as a balance point the max plastic deformation mainly locates at the peak and valley of the harmonic the axial and circumferential strain histories of measuring point e1 on the pressure hull with a shock factor of 0 595 are plotted in fig 16 both the circumferential and axial strains of t and o shaped stiffened hulls rapidly rise to their maximum values in the initial stage after the transient oscillation the circumferential and axial strains attenuate to stable values that is the plastic strains of the measuring point the circumferential plastic strain of e1 of o shaped shells was 2200 μ ε which was much larger than the axial plastic strain 611 μ ε it is obvious that both the maximum absolute value and stable absolute value substantially decreased when the t shaped stiffeners are changed to o shaped stiffeners the results show that the o shaped stiffener can alleviate the plastic deformation of the pressure hull and protect the internal equipment 4 2 shock environment analysis the shock environment of the submarine is an important indicator to describe its blast resistance the peak values of the acceleration of the measuring points for four hsfs are shown in table 4 when the hsfs are 0 119 and 0 227 it is obviously that the maximum acceleration for o stiffened shells is much smaller than the t stiffened shells the same trend of accelerations was observed in the testing and fem results compared with the t shaped stiffeners the reduction rates of peak accelerations of shells with o shaped stiffeners are over 19 for hsf 0 119 and 0 227 and 43 for hsf 0 461 and 0 595 therefore using circular tubes as stiffeners plays a more prominent role in decreasing the peak accelerations of structures in time domain the comparison of the shock response spectrums of measuring points of the two kind stiffened structures is shown in fig 17 and fig 18 when the hull shock factor is 0 119 there exists no obvious difference of the shock response spectrums between two stiffened structures in the whole frequency domain this is because there exists no water in the gap between the pressure hull and the thin hull the shock waves cannot impinge on the pressure hull directly and the shock loading must transfer through stiffeners the strength of the shock wave is not enough to make the stiffened double cylindrical shells generate large deformation and the deformation areas are mainly distributed on the thin hull however when the hull shock factor increases to a certain extent such as 0 595 large deformations appear in the structure replacing t shaped stiffeners with o shaped stiffeners does not change the low frequency modals of hulls but changes the local modals at high frequency band reflected in the impact spectrum comparison the shock response spectrums of the two hulls are basically the same at low and middle frequency bands but at the high frequency band the shock environment of o shaped stiffened double cylindrical shells is significantly reduced compared with that of t shaped stiffened double cylindrical shells the results illustrate that the o shaped stiffeners in the hulls play the key role in improve the dynamic response of the pressure hull at the high frequency band 4 3 performance of energy absorption the histories of the internal energy of each part of two stiffened double cylindrical shells are presented in fig 19 when the hsf is 0 119 both the peak internal energy and profile of t stiffened shells and o stiffened shells are very close fig 19 a the internal energy attenuates to zero finally indicated internal energy of the pressure hull is mainly the elastic deformation energy in contrast to the pressure hull the internal energy of the thin hull attenuates to a stable value fig 19 c which means slight plastic deformation appears on the thin hull besides the elastic deformation this character is in good agreement with the deformation mode shown in fig 13 the t shaped stiffeners and o shaped stiffeners do not represent obvious divergence in energy absorbing capacity for the hsf 0 119 in fig 19 e when the hsf is 0 595 the histories of the internal energy of the pressure hull of two stiffened shells are shown in fig 19 b the maximum and stable internal energy of the pressure hull significantly decreased by 12 and 11 6 respectively because of o shaped stiffeners the similar phenomenon also appears on the thin hull in fig 19 d compared with the t shaped stiffeners the maximum and stable internal energy of o shaped stiffeners increased by 117 and 57 which demonstrates that the o shaped stiffeners have a more superior elastic and plastic deformation energy capacity than t shaped stiffeners the above discussions reveal that part of the internal energy of the pressure hull and the thin hull transfers to the o shaped stiffeners the o shaped stiffener can be seen as a sacrificial structure in shells to protect the pressure hull and the thin hull 4 4 effects of thickness ratio the energy absorbing capacity of thin walled tubes is related closely to its thickness the thickness ratio is defined as the ratio between the thickness of the o shaped stiffener to that of the thin hull in this study using the finite element model described above the numerical simulations case no 7 10 are undertaken to analyze the effects of thickness ratios on the blast resistance of shells if the thickness of the o shaped stiffener is similar to that of the thin hull the large deformation tends to appear on the thin hull but not on the o shaped stiffeners the superior energy absorbing capacity of the o shaped stiffener cannot be brought into play therefore thinning the o shaped stiffeners and thicken the thin hull to keep total mass of the stiffened double cylindrical shells unchanging is necessary fig 20 gives the simulated equivalent plastic strain results of hulls with different thickness ratios obvious periodic hollows appear on the thin hull and the max peeq value is 0 0622 when the thickness ratio is 1 0 in fig 20 a in fig 20 d almost all the plastic deformations concentrate on the o shaped stiffeners and the max peeq value is 0 1445 when the thickness ratio is 0 375 it shows that the large plastic deformation gradually migrates to the o shaped stiffeners with the thickness ratio decreased from 1 0 to 0 375 but the max peeq value increased decreasing the thickness ratios will change the plastic deformation mode of stiffened double cylindrical shells it is helpful to concentrate plastic areas on stiffeners fig 021 compared the shock response spectrums of measuring points a1 and a2 of stiffened shells with graded thickness ratios with the decreasing of the thickness ratios the dynamic responses remain essentially unchanged at the low frequency band but decreased significantly at the high frequency band especially beyond 2 khz the results indicate that decreasing the thickness ratios is helpful to suppress the dynamic response of pressure hull at the high frequency band in addition fig 022 compared the internal energy changes of the each part of the stiffened shells with different thickness ratios the time histories of the internal energy have similar profiles but significantly distinct amplitudes with decreasing of thickness ratios from 1 to 0 375 the plastic deformation energy of the pressure hull and the thin shell decreased by 33 5 and 32 9 respectively while that of the o shaped stiffeners increased by 486 8 a part of the plastic deformation energy of the pressure hull and the thin shell transferred to the o shaped stiffeners the results suggest that thinner o shaped stiffeners can absorb more shock energy this is because the plastic deformation of the thinner stiffeners is easier to trigger the above research indicates that stiffened shells with smaller thickness ratios have a better blast resistance however the thickness of stiffeners cannot be reduced without a limit and the balance should be considered from more aspects 5 conclusions in this paper the underwater blast resistance of double cylindrical shells with two types of stiffeners were investigated experimentally and numerically a series of comparative live fire tests were made on two scaled cabin models one with t shaped stiffeners and the other with o shaped stiffeners a detailed numerical analysis on the shock responses of the models is made using abaqus explicit in order to explore the difference between the energy absorption characteristics of two types of stiffeners it can be concluded that 1 replacing traditional t shaped stiffeners with o shaped stiffeners is helpful to reduce the dynamic response of the shell when subjected to intensive shock loading at high frequency band it is also conducive to diminish the plastic strain of the pressure hull if large plastic deformation appears on the stiffened double cylindrical shells 2 when compressed by shock loading the plastic deformation mode of t shaped stiffeners is harmonic bulking around the central point and the maximum plastic strain is located at the peak and valley of the harmonic the plastic deformation mode of o shaped stiffeners is that the tube was gradually flattened to an oval and the plastic strain is mainly distributed on the four symmetrical points of the cross section of the tube 3 when the shock factor is 0 595 the internal energy of the pressure hull can be reduced by 12 while that of stiffeners increased by 117 after replacing t shaped stiffeners with o shaped stiffeners as a sacrificial structure the o shaped stiffener can absorb more shock energy to protect the pressure hull and the thin hull 4 the ratio between thickness of o shaped stiffeners to that of the thin hull could directly affect the blast resistance of stiffened double cylindrical shells when the thickness ratio decreases from 1 0 to 0 375 the plastic deformation of o shaped stiffeners triggered easily the dynamic response of the pressure hull decreased at the high frequency band the internal energy of the pressure hull and the thin hull can be reduced by 33 5 and 32 9 respectively and while that of stiffeners increased by 486 8 credit authorship contribution statement shizhang huang

20212,the paper presents numerical analyses of a pile supported tension leg platform tlp wind turbine during seismic loading and seabed liquefaction taking consistently into account the pile tendon platform interaction the emphasis is on the system response when subsoil liquefaction is extensive leading to degradation of the pseudo static safety factor against pile pullout well below unity it is shown that the pile resistance to pullout failure decreases drastically during shaking but fully recovers during the following dissipation of earthquake induced excess pore pressures and even exceeds the initial pre shaking resistance pile head displacements develop steadily both during shaking and dissipation but only while the static pullout safety factor remains less than unity due to the high tensional stiffness of the tendons relative to the buoyancy stiffness of the platform considered in this study the pile head pullout is mostly transmitted to the platform with a relatively small part corresponding to reduction of tendon elongation the resulting loss of buoy stability and tendon pretension may prove detrimental for the short term operation of the platform however except possibly from the rare scenario of concurrent extreme environmental loads both effects are recoverable as they are unlikely to cause irreparable damage to the foundation and the superstructure keywords tension leg platform wind turbine offshore piles liquefaction 3d numerical analysis seismic loading 1 introduction tension leg platforms tlps can be seen as highly pretensioned varieties of semi submersible platforms with the station keeping ensured by tendons i e long steel rods fixed to the seabed foundation instead of more or less taut mooring lines compared to bottom fixed support platforms e g gravity base tripod monopile and jacket supporting structures where the overall construction cost increases rapidly with water depth the cost of tlps depends on depth only for the station keeping component and becomes competitive for relatively large water depths beyond about 80 m e g big foot tlp magnolia tlp ursa tlp etc as a result this concept has received renewed attention in connection with the construction of offshore wind turbines owts at large distances from the shore where the speed of wind is high in addition to the lower construction cost the tlp concept is also appealing for high seismicity areas e g italy east mediterranean california china japan as it is rather insensitive to seismic actions especially when the pile foundation response is considered along with the tendon buoy dynamic model in fact it is widely acknowledged today e g liou et al 1988 venkataramana 1994 chandrasekaran 2008 suroor and arablouei 2019 that because of the high degree of lateral flexibility of the tendons horizontal seabed seismic motions have no significant influence on platform and tendon force response and only vertical seismic motions should be considered in designing the tlp but even in that case seismic loading may prove significant in the rare scenario of concurrent extreme environmental loads e g distinctly strong currents and high sea waves causing functional problems due to slackening of the tendons nevertheless it should be noted that the previous findings apply to seismically stable soil and foundation conditions but they are still under consideration for liquefiable sand and silt seafloor soil profiles this is because a tlp foundation typically consists of very long driven piles which upon seismic shaking and seabed liquefaction may suffer partial or total loss of their capacity to sustain the pretension of the tendons kaynia 2019 the static design of this foundation type is described with sufficient detail in a number of design guidelines e g dnv 2013 api 2014 however available guidance on the seismic design is limited and practically non existent for earthquake induced liquefaction in the foundation soil furthermore available studies for offshore foundations in liquefiable soils are fairly recent and mostly refer to pile and bucket foundations of bottom fixed support platforms esfeh and kaynia 2019 2020 ko and li 2020 wang et al 2020 huang and han 2020 in view of the above objective shortcomings the seismic design of tlp pile foundations is necessarily based on seismic code provisions for ordinary buildings where the liquefiable soil layers along the pile are either improved to mitigate liquefaction or totally ignored in computing the pullout capacity of the pile it is realized that the first option may not be practically feasible for offshore structures in deep waters while the second option will inevitably increase the foundation cost in addition it will be shown in the following that this approach may prove unnecessarily conservative for tlps as the pile head displacement during liquefaction is likely to be finite and will not lead to system collapse as in the case of bottom fixed support platforms to examine the above design issues the paper presents numerical analyses of a model tlp supported wind turbine during seismic loading and seabed liquefaction taking consistently into account the pile tendon platform interaction the basic data for the numerical analyses are derived from the poseidon model tlp which was conceptually designed and analyzed for combined wind and wave energy exploitation in mediterranean sea conditions mazarakos et al 2014 2016 2019 the emphasis is on the system response in an extreme case i e when liquefaction in the subsoil is extensive leading to degradation of the pseudo static factor of safety against pullout failure of the pile well below unity for this purpose it is assumed that the liquefiable soil deposit extends along the entire pile length instead of forming one or more layers of limited thickness 2 the poseidon floating platform the general layout of the poseidon platform is depicted in fig 1 while table 1 summarizes the properties of the platform the system consists of a triangular platform supported by cylindrical floaters with a 5 mw nrel wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 mounted at deck s center and cylindrical oscillating water column owc devices at its corners the spacing between each owc is 50 m in the center of the platform a cylindrical solid body is arranged to support the wind turbine three identical owc devices consisting of two concentric vertical cylinders for each device are placed at the corners of a triangular floater and can oscillate about their mean equilibrium position moving as a unit the draught of the platform is 20 m while the tower of the wind turbine is cantilevered at an elevation of 10 m above sea water level swl at the top of the main column of the floating platform to secure the platform the floating structure is held in position by a tension leg mooring system which consists of three steel tendons anchored at the seabed the tendons are symmetrically placed and mounted at the base of the offset columns i e at a depth of 20 m below swl the diameter of each tendon is 0 13 m while their length varies in each examined location in all cases the pretension load of each tendon is equal to f 10800 kn this load is transferred to the foundation of the platform which consists of a single driven open ended steel pipe pile under each tendon the mass including ballast of the floating platform is 2183 6 t this mass was calculated so that the combined weight of the rotor nacelle assembly tower platform plus the applied tlp pretension and the weight of the mooring system in water balances the buoyancy of the platform in the static equilibrium position in still water the equivalent in terms of buoyancy force cross sectional area of the platform is 298 53 m2 the pilot foundation design of the poseidon platform was conducted for two installation locations in aegean sea with seabed depth of approximately 200 m location a and 120 m location b given that the exact geotechnical conditions in each location are unknown the foundation design was conducted parametrically assuming four typical soil profiles in each location that cover the basic soil types commonly encountered in offshore sites two for the case of a clayey seabed soft and stiff clay and two for the case of a sandy seabed with sand of medium density and dense sand among these of interest for the present study is the case of the non cohesive seabed with medium density sand which is susceptible to earthquake induced liquefaction the relative density of the sand is assumed equal to d r 50 the friction angle to ϕ 33ο and the unit weight to γ 20 kn m3 the foundation piles were properly designed to withstand the combined static f and cyclic q c axial loads applied during the normal and extreme environmental design conditions in more detail the static loads come from the pretension of the steel tendons i e f 10800 kn while the cyclic loads are due to sea waves during a storm table 2 summarizes the significant wave height h s the corresponding wave period t p and the corresponding cyclic load q c in each tendon in both locations for normal as well as for extreme environmental design conditions bouckovalas et al 2015 initially the geometry of the pile length and diameter was determined in order to ensure that the factor of safety against static pullout is greater than 2 0 for normal environmental conditions and greater than 1 5 for extreme environmental conditions dnv 2013 api 2014 the ultimate pullout capacity of the pile q ult is calculated as 1 q ult q s ult w where w is the buoyant weight of the pile and q s ult the ultimate skin friction estimated as the integral along the pile of the unit skin friction f s defined as follows 2 f s k σ vo tan δ f s lim where k is the lateral earth pressure coefficient σ νo the effective overburden pressure δ the friction angle at the soil pile interface and f s lim the limiting unit skin friction following the suggestions by dnv det norske veritas dnv 2013 the lateral earth pressure coefficient is conservatively set equal to k 0 5 while according to api american petroleum institute api 2014 the interface angle is set to δ 25ο and the limiting unit skin friction to f s lim 81 kpa for the medium density sand considered herein in the sequel it was examined whether the static pile design is also adequate against cyclic pullout of the pile due to the repetitive action of the sea waves jardine and standing 2012 tsuha et al 2012 rimoy 2013 due to the relatively small cyclic loads the pile design for both sites a and b was finally controlled by the factor of safety against static pullout under normal environmental conditions this led to the selection of a steel pipe pile of length l 55 m and outer diameter d 2 5 m note that the preceding design also accounts for potential scouring of the seabed along the top 3 m about 1 3d of the pile dnv 2013 thus the final pile length considered in the subsequent numerical analyses is l 52 m the wall thickness of the pile was set to t 31 35 mm in order to avoid soil smearing during the tip penetration and damage during pile driving api 2014 3 numerical modeling and methodology outline 3 1 the 3 d numerical model the problem is analyzed numerically by means of 3 d coupled dynamic analyses with the finite difference code flac3d v6 0 itasca 2017 the specific code employs an explicit scheme for the integration of the equations of motion which is more efficient for highly nonlinear problems like the one analyzed herein while it allows for coupling between water flow and dynamic loading the numerical methodology has been widely verified and applied in the past in problems involving soil liquefaction and soil foundation structure interaction proving its capability both to qualitatively describe the governing mechanisms as well as to provide quantitative estimates of the performance chaloulos et al 2013 bouckovalas et al 2016 dimitriadi et al 2018 the 3 d mesh built to simulate the problem is shown in fig 2 a a pile of length l and diameter d is installed in a liquefiable uniform layer of nevada sand of relative density d r and permeability k note that the specific type of sand is considered since the constitutive model applied in the study has been calibrated against tests results for this type of sand see following paragraphs as the owcs are at large distance apart i e 50 m or 25d each pile and tendon support is simulated independently the liquefiable sand layer extends to the pile tip elevation followed in depth by a much denser sand layer of thickness 4d the pile supports a floater defined in terms of its cross sectional area a fl through a pretensioned tendon of free length before pretension l free cross sectional area a t and young s modulus e t the floater tendon system can be adequately represented by two serially connected springs fig 2b which are simulated herein by two sets of cable elements fig 2a the properties of the cables length cross sectional area and young s modulus are properly calibrated to provide the axial stiffness of the tendon k t i e the tendon s resistance against unit tensile displacement and the axial stiffness of the floater k fl i e the floater s resistance against unit downward displacement computed as tsiapas et al 2021 3 k t e t a t l free and 4 k f l a fl γ w taking into account that the vertical plane crossing the pile axis in the direction of seismic shaking is a plane of symmetry only half of the physical problem is simulated while displacements normal to that plane are restrained during static uplift loading of the pile the base of the model is fixed in all three directions and vertical hinges are applied on the vertical boundaries during seismic shaking the hinges at the lateral boundaries are replaced with tied nodes which impose the same boundary displacements at grid points of the same elevation replicating free field conditions while a harmonic motion of n cycles with amplitude a max and period t is directly applied at the base assuming rigid bedrock conditions the in plane and out of plane width of the mesh is 40d and 20d respectively the thickness of each zone is 1 0 m while the width is approximately equal to 0 2d next to the pile and gradually increases to about 2d at the lateral boundaries the highly nonlinear response of the liquefiable sand is simulated with ntua sand andrianopoulos et al 2010 papadimitriou and bouckovalas 2002 implemented in flac3d as a c plug in constitutive model ntua sand can accurately simulate both the nonlinear hysteretic response of sands as well as shakedown effects and liquefaction softening during cyclic loading the model has been calibrated against both static and cyclic tests on saturated fine nevada sand specimens for a wide range of initial conditions arulmoli et al 1992 ntua sand is also used to simulate the response of the dense sand layer below the pile tip while the pile is simulated through elastic solid elements with the axial stiffness of a hollow steel pile with diameter d 2 5 m and wall thickness t 31 35 mm a key aspect of the numerical methodology is the accurate simulation of the pile soil interface as both the pile soil relative slip and the pullout capacity of the pile are directly related to the strength characteristics and the radial stresses of that interface for that purpose the three different numerical schemes shown in fig 3 are applied and extensively evaluated in the first case fig 3a a thin layer 5 cm of solid mohr coulomb elements is inserted between the elements that simulate the soil and the pile in the second case fig 3b a single set of interface elements is placed between the pile and the soil and in the third case fig 3c six sets of interface elements are installed one for each of the set of zones that encircle the pile it should be noted that the last two schemes should not make a difference theoretically however in flac3d they produce different numerical results as it will be shown in the following interface elements in flac3d are one sided i e they are attached to a host surface so that when another zone surface called the target surface comes in contact with it the two surfaces may interact through the interface element interaction occurs both in the direction normal to the interface to simulate possible separation between the host and the target surface as well as in the direction parallel to the interface to simulate possible sliding flac3d incorporates an elastic perfectly plastic law for the interfaces defined in terms of the elastic stiffnesses and the strength parameters in the normal direction a tensile strength is assigned which limits the maximum tensile normal stress at the interface in the parallel direction a mohr coulomb failure criterion is adopted in terms of the interface cohesion and friction angle and also the effective normal stress based on the results of sensitivity analyses for the problem at hand large values are assigned to the elastic stiffnesses of the interface to ensure rigid plastic response i e that no interface straining occurs before yield the tensile strength and the shearing cohesion of the interface are set to zero while the interface friction angle is set to δ 25 api 2014 from a numerical point of view it is important to clarify that the criterion for selecting the appropriate interface scheme is the ability to ensure that the radial stresses at the interface and in the surrounding soil are equal this is a basic requirement so that the skin friction of the pile is consistently predicted during all stages of seismic shaking and liquefaction and is accurately integrated into the overall response of the pile tendon floater system to show this fig 4 compares all three schemes in terms of the distribution of the radial stresses along the pile both at the interface elements and the corresponding neighboring soil elements the comparison is shown for two distinct stages of a typical analysis at geostatic equilibrium prior to application of the pretension and at the end of shaking soil and interface radial stresses are shown in green and red lines respectively while the black dashed line shows the analytically computed horizontal geostatic stresses the use of thin mohr coulomb zones fig 4a captures accurately the initial geostatic stress field at the soil and at the interface but fails at the end of shaking where predicted interface stresses are significantly larger compared to those at the soil the use of a single interface fig 4b fails to establish a realistic stress field even under initial geostatic conditions in this case soil and interface stresses have notable differences they both diverge from the initial geostatic distribution while the observed differences increase at the end of shaking the source of this unrealistic response is not clear it is only speculated that it may be related to the way the normal direction of the interface is defined relative to the corresponding target surface in the contrary the scheme with the multiple interfaces fig 4c which is finally adopted for the numerical analyses captures accurately the initial geostatic stress field as well as the reduced due to excess pore pressure buildup interface and soil stresses at the end of shaking to further assess the effects of the previous modeling differences on the macroscopic response of the pile the above radial stress distributions were used to analytically calculate the pullout capacity of the pile before as well as after shaking the calculations are performed by implementing the numerically computed stresses in the api and dnv guidelines see eqs 1 and 2 for the case of the multiple interfaces scheme for which the interface stress distribution follows that of the adjacent soil the pre shaking and post shaking pullout capacities are estimated to be 23600 kn and 2540 kn respectively with the latter being significantly decreased as a result of soil liquefaction fig 4c compared to the above the use of mohr coulomb elements captures quite accurately the pre shaking capacity but significantly overestimates the post seismic capacity at 23500 kn the use of a single interface element also provides a consistent estimate of the pre shaking capacity while still failing to capture the post shaking capacity with the corresponding prediction being equal to 8803 kn 3 2 numerical solution sequence the seismic response analysis of the pile tendon floater system is performed in two stages initially the pretension force f 10800 kn is applied statically at the structural node corresponding to the top of the floater in the sequel the displacement of that node is constrained and the input seismic motion is applied at the base of the model the analysis continues beyond the end of shaking until excess pore pressures dissipate completely during this second stage the displacements of the pile head and the floater are continuously monitored along with the loss of tendon pretension and floater buoyancy τo better understand the mechanisms that control the system response it was also necessary to monitor the variation with time during shaking and following excess pore water pressure dissipation of the degraded pullout capacity of the pile when numerically performed this last task may increase the computational effort enormously as it is not part of the main seismic response analysis but it has to be performed independently at regular time intervals based on the ever current stress state around the pile for this reason the static pullout capacity of the pile is computed analytically according to the api api 2014 and dnv dnv 2013 recommendations combined with the liquefaction affected radial stresses at the pile soil interface predicted during the seismic stage of the numerical analysis this semi analytical methodology has been implemented in the numerical analysis through a user defined subroutine written in flac3d s inbuilt programming language fish to provide the continuous with time variation of the pile capacity to sustain the tendon pretension load prior to the application of seismic loading the numerical methodology was first employed to calculate the static i e in the absence of excess pore pressure buildup response of the pile fig 5 presents the numerical load displacement curve for the total load q and the friction resistance q s black and red solid lines respectively computed numerically for an interface friction angle δ 25ο and the reduced due to scouring pile length l 52 m the analysis is performed under drained conditions by applying a constant upward velocity at the free end of the buoyancy spring determined so that inertial effects are minimized also plotted in this figure are the corresponding analytical estimates dashed lines for the ultimate values of q and q s note that for the comparison shown herein the analytical estimates are obtained without considering the cutoff limit for the shaft friction eq 2 since the numerical analyses do not incorporate this effect observe that the numerical and the analytical methodologies are in fairly good agreement with regard to both the ultimate skin friction as well as the ultimate pile capacity 4 liquefaction effects on pile tendon floater response the basic analysis presented herein is performed for location b water depth 120 m assuming that the relative density of the liquefiable layer is d r 50 and that of the underlying non liquefiable sand is d r 90 the permeability is set equal to k 6 6 10 5 m s for both layers based on the results of constant head tests on specimens of nevada sand arulmoli et al 1992 note that the specific soil permeability value is also representative of silty sand formations the single tendon pile support considered in the analysis is attached to a floater with equivalent cross section area a fl 99 51 m2 i e 1 3 of the total while the free length of the tendon is l free 100 m the associated cross section area is a t 0 01327 m2 and the modulus of elasticity is e t 200 gpa according to εqs 3 and 4 the preceding values lead to an axial stiffness k t 62800 kn m and k fl 995 kn m for the tendon and the floater respectively the input seismic motion consists of n 15 uniform acceleration cycles corresponding to a mw 7 5 earthquake with amplitude a max 0 24 g and period t 0 5 sec the results of these analyses are presented and evaluated in the following in order to investigate the mechanisms that govern the response of the soil pile tendon floater system from a design point of view the emphasis is on the degradation of the pile pullout capacity the accumulation of pullout displacements as well as the ensuing effects on the tendon pretension and the stability of the floater 4 1 pile response fig 6 summarizes the response of the pile tendon floater system more specifically fig 6a presents time histories of the pile s pullout capacity q ult and the tendon s force f black and red line respectively both during and after the end of shaking until full excess pore pressure dissipation similarly fig 6b presents the factor of safety against pullout of the pile fs q ult f as well as the stability safety factor fs st a w fl a is the total buoyancy force and w fl is the weight of the floater while fig 6c shows the uplift displacement of the pile head and the floater in order to further verify the semi analytical procedure for the estimation of q ult during and after shaking a set of numerical analyses is performed at selected time instances to compute q ult and compare with the analytical estimates the analyses are performed by restoring the stress and density state from the dynamic analysis at the selected time instance and by applying a vertical upwards displacement at the uppermost cable node corresponding to the head of the floater analyses are performed assuming undrained conditions i e the fluid flow option is switched to off the results of these analyses shown with blue bullets in fig 6a are consistently in good agreement with the corresponding analytical estimates both during and after the end of shaking as shown in fig 6a the pullout capacity of the pile q ult is initially equal to its pre shaking value 23600 kn and starts to decrease immediately after the beginning of shaking as a result of excess pore pressure buildup at approximately t 3 6 3 7 sec q ult becomes less than the pretension force f signifying a factor of safety against pile pullout less than unity fig 6b q ult continues to decrease until the end of shaking at t 8 sec where it reaches a local minimum q ult min 2540 kn corresponding to a degraded factor of safety fs 0 24 this local minimum practically corresponds to the buoyant weight of the pile as the contribution from the side friction is negligible due to the extensive soil liquefaction after the end of shaking and as excess pore pressures start to dissipate and the soil regains its shear strength q ult gradually increases at approximately t 260 sec the factor of safety becomes again larger than unity while at t 3000 sec when the hydrostatic pore pressure distribution has been restored q ult stabilizes it is noteworthy that this final value of q ult 32150 kn is approximately 36 higher than the initial pre shaking pullout capacity value as a result the final pullout factor of safety increases from its initial pre shaking value of fs 2 19 to fs 3 70 this strength gain which is also confirmed by the numerical analyses see blue bullet at t 3000 sec can be attributed to the long term increase in lateral effective stresses that takes place due to shaking and the following soil consolidation this is demonstrated in fig 7 which presents the variation with depth of the effective radial stresses before shaking and at the end of consolidation red and green lines respectively it therefore turns out that the radial stresses at the end of consolidation are considerably increased especially at deeper elevations thus inducing a significantly larger pullout capacity this is a common phenomenon observed also in cyclic laboratory tests e g cyclic oedometer and dss direct simple shear tests attributed to the lateral displacement constraint imposed on the pile soil interface elements by the rigid pile boundary based on the above the following characteristic time instances can be identified with regard to the time histories in fig 6 point a t a 3 6 3 7 sec the factor of safety drops below 1 0 for the first time point b t b 8 0 sec end of shaking when q ult reaches a local minimum approximately equal to the buoyant weight of the pile point c t c 260 sec the factor of safety becomes again larger than 1 0 point d t d 3000 sec end of consolidation when the post shaking pullout capacity stabilizes to a value larger than the initial the evolution of the factor of safety against pullout is the key factor explaining the accumulation of pile displacements more specifically as shown in fig 6c pile displacements are limited to 5 6 cm while the factor of safety remains greater than 1 0 until point a however as long as the fs becomes and remains lower than 1 0 between points a and c the rate of displacement accumulation increases substantially it is noteworthy that at the end of shaking only a fraction of the total pullout displacement has accumulated namely at the end of shaking at point b displacements are approximately equal to 0 24 m and at the end of the failure stage at point c they increase to 2 10 m afterwards between points c and d the factor of safety becomes again larger than 1 0 and pile head displacements stabilize the above observations suggest that the accumulation of pile pullout displacements is primarily influenced by the duration of the failure stage i e the time period during which the factor of safety remains below unity i e t c t a in fig 6b to confirm this finding the numerical analysis was repeated for a tenfold permeability coefficient k 6 6 10 4 m s such as for clean sands and the results are compared with those for the baseline analysis in fig 8 black and red lines respectively in terms of the pullout factor of safety and the pile head displacements observe that in the case of more permeable soil excess pore pressures dissipate faster and consequently the failure stage t c t a is substantially shorter as a result although the co seismic displacements are practically the same the final displacements are substantially decreased from 2 10 m to 0 85 m 4 2 soil response the above patterns are directly associated with the excess pore pressure generation and soil liquefaction in particular fig 9 shows time histories of excess pore pressure ratio r u from the baseline analysis at depths z 1 10 and 40 m below ground surface both at the free field and next to the pile red and black lines respectively in addition fig 10 shows the corresponding excess pore pressure ratio contours at t t b 8 sec i e at the end of shaking and at t t c 260 sec i e when the post seismic factor of safety against pullout becomes greater than unity in order to account for the stress distribution that takes place during shaking the traditional r u definition i e r u δu σ vo is herein adjusted as 5 r u δ u σ v δ u where δu is the generated excess pore pressures and σ v the ever current vertical effective stress focusing first on the co seismic response t 0 8 sec fig 9 shows that complete liquefaction i e r u 0 9 1 0 extends gradually to almost the entire soil mass with the exception of the area around the pile head where the excess pore pressure ratio stabilizes at a peak value of r u 0 5 0 6 fig 9a this non liquefied zone is more clearly illustrated in fig 10a where it forms an inverted cone and extends to a depth of about 4 5 m 1 6 2 0d this type of response can be attributed both to the low effective overburden stresses that prevail at shallow depths which favor a more dilative response as well on the large pile soil relative displacement and the associated shear induced dilation note that a similar soil response has been observed in the past for piles loaded laterally due to liquefaction induced lateral spreading gonzález et al 2009 chaloulos et al 2014 as shown in fig 10a a similar yet narrower zone 1 0 1 5d is formed near the tip presumably due to the suction caused by the detachment of the pile tip from the underlying sand to gain insight on the mechanisms behind this type of response fig 11 presents the stress paths in the form of shear vs vertical effective stress and the corresponding stress strain curves at the free field fig 11a and b and next to the pile fig 11c and d both at a depth of z 1 5 m below the ground surface i e inside the zone of dilative response as shown in fig 11a and b the response at the free field is typical of a soil element undergoing strain controlled undrained cyclic simple shear loading as the seismic loading progresses the vertical effective stress gradually decreases reflecting the soil s tendency to contract after approximately 5 6 loading cycles the vertical effective stress practically becomes equal to zero indicating complete liquefaction of the soil similarly as suggested by the stress strain response the soil stiffness gradually decreases the stress strain loops become gradually more horizontal on the other hand the soil next to the pile exhibits a significantly different type of response as shown in the stress path of fig 11c the soil has an initial static shear stress approximately equal to 2 0 kpa i e a static stress ratio of 2 0 14 0 0 14 as a result of the static pullout of the pile as in the free field case the vertical effective stress initially decreases however after 2 3 loading cycles it starts increasing denoting the soil s tendency to dilate while it temporarily becomes larger than its initial pre shaking value this type of response is also reflected in the stress strain curve fig 11d where the loops appear to demonstrate a hardening type of response post seismically i e at t 8 sec excess pore pressures dissipate primarily towards the ground surface as evidenced in fig 9 and in fig 10b which show that the excess pore pressures at large depths dissipate faster furthermore fig 9 shows that this upward flow causes the pore pressures near the pile head where the soil has not fully liquefied to increase slightly before they also start to dissipate it is also noteworthy that the duration of the dissipation process is disproportionally large compared to the duration of shaking for the baseline case shown herein with a permeability coefficient k 6 6 10 5 m s complete excess pore pressure dissipation does not occur until t 2500 3000 sec while the shaking ends at t 8 sec it is interesting to observe the correlation between the generation of excess pore pressures and the degradation of the pile s pullout capacity namely as shown in fig 6b the factor of safety drops below unity i e at t a 3 6 3 7 sec at the time when the excess pore pressures ratios in fig 9 become significant i e r u 0 6 furthermore the ultimate pullout capacity q ult and the factor of safety fs reach a local minimum at the end of shaking i e at t b 8 0 sec when the bulk of the foundation soil has liquefied fig 10a finally as shown in fig 10b at t t c 260 sec the dissipation process has progressed significantly so that the soil has regained a considerable amount of its shear strength and the factor of safety becomes again larger than unity in this context it would be practical to develop an analytical correlation between the pull out capacity and the excess pore pressure ratio in the vicinity of the pile ru pile however this is not feasible as the value of the latter at the pile soil interface is affected by a large number of soil foundation seismic excitation parameters while it is the result of complex pile soil interaction mechanisms e g pore fluid flow shear induced dilation etc which cannot be incorporated in a simplified analytical relationship 4 3 tendon floater response pullout of the pile causes the floater to move upwards and the tendon to lose part of its elongation and pretension force this is shown in fig 6c which presents the time history of the upward displacement of the floater red line compared to that of the pile head black line observe that the upward displacement evolution of the floater resembles that of the pile head initially until t a it is very limited and afterwards it increases steadily with time until the end of the failure phase i e at t c finally the floater stabilizes to an upward displacement of about 2 06 m that is approximately 4 cm less than the final pile head displacement of 2 10 m thus for the poseidon model tlp examined herein pile head displacement is almost entirely by approximately 98 transmitted to the floater with only a small part corresponding to reduction of the tendon elongation as a result the tension force of the tendon is reduced by approximately 20 from f 10800 kn to approximately f f 8700 kn fig 6a while the stability safety factor of the floater decreases by 10 from fs st o 2 18 to fs st f 1 96 fig 6b it should be noted that the system studied herein employs a relatively short tendon due to the shallow water depth with high tensional stiffness for larger water depths and less stiff tendons the percentage of pile head pullout that is transferred to the floater will substantially decrease leading to higher loss of pretension and platform stability 5 conclusions in summary the following are concluded with regard to the effects of seismic liquefaction on the overall performance of the model tlp system examined in this study a upon complete free field liquefaction the excess pore pressure ratio becomes approximately equal to unity r u 0 9 1 0 along almost the entire pile length significantly lower excess pore pressures r u 0 0 0 6 develop along the top 4 5 m 1 6 2 0d of the pile where the combination of relatively low effective geostatic stresses and large shear strains due to the pullout pile displacements leads to dilation of the sand in contact to the pile b as a result the skin friction resistance of the pile is drastically reduced during shaking and it is almost eliminated when free field liquefaction extends over the entire pile length at that stage the main force resisting the pretension of the tendons is the buoyant weight of the pile thus the minimum degraded factor of safety at the end of shaking was approximately equal to fs 0 24 regardless of the assumed permeability coefficient of the liquefiable seabed soil c the pile resistance to pullout failure increases with dissipation of the excess pore pressures developed during shaking while the associated factor of safety becomes gradually larger than unity it is of special practical interest to note that the long term value of the pullout resistance after complete excess pore pressure dissipation exceeded the initial design value by about 36 this is attributed to the increase of the total and effective radial soil stresses at the pile soil interface caused by seismic shaking d pile head displacements develop essentially within the time period during and after shaking when the factor of safety against static pullout of the pile remains less than unity i e during foundation failure as a result the final pile head displacements were reduced from 2 10 m to 0 85 m when the permeability coefficient of the liquefiable sand was tenfold increased and consequently the period of foundation failure decreased from 250 sec to about 30 sec the displacements are insignificant before and after that time period as long as the factor of safety remains larger than unity e due to the high stiffness of the tendons considered herein relative to the buoyancy stiffness of the platform pile head displacements were almost entirely 98 transmitted to the platform with only a very small part 2 corresponding to reduction of tendon elongation thus the maximum rise of the platform was 2 06 m leading to a 11 0 decrease in the stability factor of safety fs st of the platform while the maximum reduction in the tendon elongation was 4 1 cm leading to a 20 loss of pretension the above observations confirm that earthquake induced liquefaction is not catastrophic for tlp systems as for other bottom fixed support platforms e g gravity base tripod monopile and jacket supporting structures despite the temporary complete loss of soil strength pile head displacements are sustainable and the same applies to the loss of tendon pretension and floater buoyancy which are not likely to jeopardize the overall safety of the platform furthermore the above effects are potentially recoverable as pretension of the tendons can be restored thus ensuring functionality and seismic resilience for the tlp installation nevertheless it should be acknowledged that the basic pile tendon buoy interaction mechanisms identified herein should be further investigated with the aid of parametric analyses for a wide range of design parameters and also verified experimentally of particular interest is the differential rise tilting of the platform which may develop due to lateral soil inhomogeneity and differences in the tendon loads as well as the potentially detrimental effect on the platform stability of any other concurrent hostile environmental conditions such high sea waves strong winds and currents credit authors contribution statement yannis k chaloulos yannis z tsiapas george d bouckovalas

20212,the paper presents numerical analyses of a pile supported tension leg platform tlp wind turbine during seismic loading and seabed liquefaction taking consistently into account the pile tendon platform interaction the emphasis is on the system response when subsoil liquefaction is extensive leading to degradation of the pseudo static safety factor against pile pullout well below unity it is shown that the pile resistance to pullout failure decreases drastically during shaking but fully recovers during the following dissipation of earthquake induced excess pore pressures and even exceeds the initial pre shaking resistance pile head displacements develop steadily both during shaking and dissipation but only while the static pullout safety factor remains less than unity due to the high tensional stiffness of the tendons relative to the buoyancy stiffness of the platform considered in this study the pile head pullout is mostly transmitted to the platform with a relatively small part corresponding to reduction of tendon elongation the resulting loss of buoy stability and tendon pretension may prove detrimental for the short term operation of the platform however except possibly from the rare scenario of concurrent extreme environmental loads both effects are recoverable as they are unlikely to cause irreparable damage to the foundation and the superstructure keywords tension leg platform wind turbine offshore piles liquefaction 3d numerical analysis seismic loading 1 introduction tension leg platforms tlps can be seen as highly pretensioned varieties of semi submersible platforms with the station keeping ensured by tendons i e long steel rods fixed to the seabed foundation instead of more or less taut mooring lines compared to bottom fixed support platforms e g gravity base tripod monopile and jacket supporting structures where the overall construction cost increases rapidly with water depth the cost of tlps depends on depth only for the station keeping component and becomes competitive for relatively large water depths beyond about 80 m e g big foot tlp magnolia tlp ursa tlp etc as a result this concept has received renewed attention in connection with the construction of offshore wind turbines owts at large distances from the shore where the speed of wind is high in addition to the lower construction cost the tlp concept is also appealing for high seismicity areas e g italy east mediterranean california china japan as it is rather insensitive to seismic actions especially when the pile foundation response is considered along with the tendon buoy dynamic model in fact it is widely acknowledged today e g liou et al 1988 venkataramana 1994 chandrasekaran 2008 suroor and arablouei 2019 that because of the high degree of lateral flexibility of the tendons horizontal seabed seismic motions have no significant influence on platform and tendon force response and only vertical seismic motions should be considered in designing the tlp but even in that case seismic loading may prove significant in the rare scenario of concurrent extreme environmental loads e g distinctly strong currents and high sea waves causing functional problems due to slackening of the tendons nevertheless it should be noted that the previous findings apply to seismically stable soil and foundation conditions but they are still under consideration for liquefiable sand and silt seafloor soil profiles this is because a tlp foundation typically consists of very long driven piles which upon seismic shaking and seabed liquefaction may suffer partial or total loss of their capacity to sustain the pretension of the tendons kaynia 2019 the static design of this foundation type is described with sufficient detail in a number of design guidelines e g dnv 2013 api 2014 however available guidance on the seismic design is limited and practically non existent for earthquake induced liquefaction in the foundation soil furthermore available studies for offshore foundations in liquefiable soils are fairly recent and mostly refer to pile and bucket foundations of bottom fixed support platforms esfeh and kaynia 2019 2020 ko and li 2020 wang et al 2020 huang and han 2020 in view of the above objective shortcomings the seismic design of tlp pile foundations is necessarily based on seismic code provisions for ordinary buildings where the liquefiable soil layers along the pile are either improved to mitigate liquefaction or totally ignored in computing the pullout capacity of the pile it is realized that the first option may not be practically feasible for offshore structures in deep waters while the second option will inevitably increase the foundation cost in addition it will be shown in the following that this approach may prove unnecessarily conservative for tlps as the pile head displacement during liquefaction is likely to be finite and will not lead to system collapse as in the case of bottom fixed support platforms to examine the above design issues the paper presents numerical analyses of a model tlp supported wind turbine during seismic loading and seabed liquefaction taking consistently into account the pile tendon platform interaction the basic data for the numerical analyses are derived from the poseidon model tlp which was conceptually designed and analyzed for combined wind and wave energy exploitation in mediterranean sea conditions mazarakos et al 2014 2016 2019 the emphasis is on the system response in an extreme case i e when liquefaction in the subsoil is extensive leading to degradation of the pseudo static factor of safety against pullout failure of the pile well below unity for this purpose it is assumed that the liquefiable soil deposit extends along the entire pile length instead of forming one or more layers of limited thickness 2 the poseidon floating platform the general layout of the poseidon platform is depicted in fig 1 while table 1 summarizes the properties of the platform the system consists of a triangular platform supported by cylindrical floaters with a 5 mw nrel wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 mounted at deck s center and cylindrical oscillating water column owc devices at its corners the spacing between each owc is 50 m in the center of the platform a cylindrical solid body is arranged to support the wind turbine three identical owc devices consisting of two concentric vertical cylinders for each device are placed at the corners of a triangular floater and can oscillate about their mean equilibrium position moving as a unit the draught of the platform is 20 m while the tower of the wind turbine is cantilevered at an elevation of 10 m above sea water level swl at the top of the main column of the floating platform to secure the platform the floating structure is held in position by a tension leg mooring system which consists of three steel tendons anchored at the seabed the tendons are symmetrically placed and mounted at the base of the offset columns i e at a depth of 20 m below swl the diameter of each tendon is 0 13 m while their length varies in each examined location in all cases the pretension load of each tendon is equal to f 10800 kn this load is transferred to the foundation of the platform which consists of a single driven open ended steel pipe pile under each tendon the mass including ballast of the floating platform is 2183 6 t this mass was calculated so that the combined weight of the rotor nacelle assembly tower platform plus the applied tlp pretension and the weight of the mooring system in water balances the buoyancy of the platform in the static equilibrium position in still water the equivalent in terms of buoyancy force cross sectional area of the platform is 298 53 m2 the pilot foundation design of the poseidon platform was conducted for two installation locations in aegean sea with seabed depth of approximately 200 m location a and 120 m location b given that the exact geotechnical conditions in each location are unknown the foundation design was conducted parametrically assuming four typical soil profiles in each location that cover the basic soil types commonly encountered in offshore sites two for the case of a clayey seabed soft and stiff clay and two for the case of a sandy seabed with sand of medium density and dense sand among these of interest for the present study is the case of the non cohesive seabed with medium density sand which is susceptible to earthquake induced liquefaction the relative density of the sand is assumed equal to d r 50 the friction angle to ϕ 33ο and the unit weight to γ 20 kn m3 the foundation piles were properly designed to withstand the combined static f and cyclic q c axial loads applied during the normal and extreme environmental design conditions in more detail the static loads come from the pretension of the steel tendons i e f 10800 kn while the cyclic loads are due to sea waves during a storm table 2 summarizes the significant wave height h s the corresponding wave period t p and the corresponding cyclic load q c in each tendon in both locations for normal as well as for extreme environmental design conditions bouckovalas et al 2015 initially the geometry of the pile length and diameter was determined in order to ensure that the factor of safety against static pullout is greater than 2 0 for normal environmental conditions and greater than 1 5 for extreme environmental conditions dnv 2013 api 2014 the ultimate pullout capacity of the pile q ult is calculated as 1 q ult q s ult w where w is the buoyant weight of the pile and q s ult the ultimate skin friction estimated as the integral along the pile of the unit skin friction f s defined as follows 2 f s k σ vo tan δ f s lim where k is the lateral earth pressure coefficient σ νo the effective overburden pressure δ the friction angle at the soil pile interface and f s lim the limiting unit skin friction following the suggestions by dnv det norske veritas dnv 2013 the lateral earth pressure coefficient is conservatively set equal to k 0 5 while according to api american petroleum institute api 2014 the interface angle is set to δ 25ο and the limiting unit skin friction to f s lim 81 kpa for the medium density sand considered herein in the sequel it was examined whether the static pile design is also adequate against cyclic pullout of the pile due to the repetitive action of the sea waves jardine and standing 2012 tsuha et al 2012 rimoy 2013 due to the relatively small cyclic loads the pile design for both sites a and b was finally controlled by the factor of safety against static pullout under normal environmental conditions this led to the selection of a steel pipe pile of length l 55 m and outer diameter d 2 5 m note that the preceding design also accounts for potential scouring of the seabed along the top 3 m about 1 3d of the pile dnv 2013 thus the final pile length considered in the subsequent numerical analyses is l 52 m the wall thickness of the pile was set to t 31 35 mm in order to avoid soil smearing during the tip penetration and damage during pile driving api 2014 3 numerical modeling and methodology outline 3 1 the 3 d numerical model the problem is analyzed numerically by means of 3 d coupled dynamic analyses with the finite difference code flac3d v6 0 itasca 2017 the specific code employs an explicit scheme for the integration of the equations of motion which is more efficient for highly nonlinear problems like the one analyzed herein while it allows for coupling between water flow and dynamic loading the numerical methodology has been widely verified and applied in the past in problems involving soil liquefaction and soil foundation structure interaction proving its capability both to qualitatively describe the governing mechanisms as well as to provide quantitative estimates of the performance chaloulos et al 2013 bouckovalas et al 2016 dimitriadi et al 2018 the 3 d mesh built to simulate the problem is shown in fig 2 a a pile of length l and diameter d is installed in a liquefiable uniform layer of nevada sand of relative density d r and permeability k note that the specific type of sand is considered since the constitutive model applied in the study has been calibrated against tests results for this type of sand see following paragraphs as the owcs are at large distance apart i e 50 m or 25d each pile and tendon support is simulated independently the liquefiable sand layer extends to the pile tip elevation followed in depth by a much denser sand layer of thickness 4d the pile supports a floater defined in terms of its cross sectional area a fl through a pretensioned tendon of free length before pretension l free cross sectional area a t and young s modulus e t the floater tendon system can be adequately represented by two serially connected springs fig 2b which are simulated herein by two sets of cable elements fig 2a the properties of the cables length cross sectional area and young s modulus are properly calibrated to provide the axial stiffness of the tendon k t i e the tendon s resistance against unit tensile displacement and the axial stiffness of the floater k fl i e the floater s resistance against unit downward displacement computed as tsiapas et al 2021 3 k t e t a t l free and 4 k f l a fl γ w taking into account that the vertical plane crossing the pile axis in the direction of seismic shaking is a plane of symmetry only half of the physical problem is simulated while displacements normal to that plane are restrained during static uplift loading of the pile the base of the model is fixed in all three directions and vertical hinges are applied on the vertical boundaries during seismic shaking the hinges at the lateral boundaries are replaced with tied nodes which impose the same boundary displacements at grid points of the same elevation replicating free field conditions while a harmonic motion of n cycles with amplitude a max and period t is directly applied at the base assuming rigid bedrock conditions the in plane and out of plane width of the mesh is 40d and 20d respectively the thickness of each zone is 1 0 m while the width is approximately equal to 0 2d next to the pile and gradually increases to about 2d at the lateral boundaries the highly nonlinear response of the liquefiable sand is simulated with ntua sand andrianopoulos et al 2010 papadimitriou and bouckovalas 2002 implemented in flac3d as a c plug in constitutive model ntua sand can accurately simulate both the nonlinear hysteretic response of sands as well as shakedown effects and liquefaction softening during cyclic loading the model has been calibrated against both static and cyclic tests on saturated fine nevada sand specimens for a wide range of initial conditions arulmoli et al 1992 ntua sand is also used to simulate the response of the dense sand layer below the pile tip while the pile is simulated through elastic solid elements with the axial stiffness of a hollow steel pile with diameter d 2 5 m and wall thickness t 31 35 mm a key aspect of the numerical methodology is the accurate simulation of the pile soil interface as both the pile soil relative slip and the pullout capacity of the pile are directly related to the strength characteristics and the radial stresses of that interface for that purpose the three different numerical schemes shown in fig 3 are applied and extensively evaluated in the first case fig 3a a thin layer 5 cm of solid mohr coulomb elements is inserted between the elements that simulate the soil and the pile in the second case fig 3b a single set of interface elements is placed between the pile and the soil and in the third case fig 3c six sets of interface elements are installed one for each of the set of zones that encircle the pile it should be noted that the last two schemes should not make a difference theoretically however in flac3d they produce different numerical results as it will be shown in the following interface elements in flac3d are one sided i e they are attached to a host surface so that when another zone surface called the target surface comes in contact with it the two surfaces may interact through the interface element interaction occurs both in the direction normal to the interface to simulate possible separation between the host and the target surface as well as in the direction parallel to the interface to simulate possible sliding flac3d incorporates an elastic perfectly plastic law for the interfaces defined in terms of the elastic stiffnesses and the strength parameters in the normal direction a tensile strength is assigned which limits the maximum tensile normal stress at the interface in the parallel direction a mohr coulomb failure criterion is adopted in terms of the interface cohesion and friction angle and also the effective normal stress based on the results of sensitivity analyses for the problem at hand large values are assigned to the elastic stiffnesses of the interface to ensure rigid plastic response i e that no interface straining occurs before yield the tensile strength and the shearing cohesion of the interface are set to zero while the interface friction angle is set to δ 25 api 2014 from a numerical point of view it is important to clarify that the criterion for selecting the appropriate interface scheme is the ability to ensure that the radial stresses at the interface and in the surrounding soil are equal this is a basic requirement so that the skin friction of the pile is consistently predicted during all stages of seismic shaking and liquefaction and is accurately integrated into the overall response of the pile tendon floater system to show this fig 4 compares all three schemes in terms of the distribution of the radial stresses along the pile both at the interface elements and the corresponding neighboring soil elements the comparison is shown for two distinct stages of a typical analysis at geostatic equilibrium prior to application of the pretension and at the end of shaking soil and interface radial stresses are shown in green and red lines respectively while the black dashed line shows the analytically computed horizontal geostatic stresses the use of thin mohr coulomb zones fig 4a captures accurately the initial geostatic stress field at the soil and at the interface but fails at the end of shaking where predicted interface stresses are significantly larger compared to those at the soil the use of a single interface fig 4b fails to establish a realistic stress field even under initial geostatic conditions in this case soil and interface stresses have notable differences they both diverge from the initial geostatic distribution while the observed differences increase at the end of shaking the source of this unrealistic response is not clear it is only speculated that it may be related to the way the normal direction of the interface is defined relative to the corresponding target surface in the contrary the scheme with the multiple interfaces fig 4c which is finally adopted for the numerical analyses captures accurately the initial geostatic stress field as well as the reduced due to excess pore pressure buildup interface and soil stresses at the end of shaking to further assess the effects of the previous modeling differences on the macroscopic response of the pile the above radial stress distributions were used to analytically calculate the pullout capacity of the pile before as well as after shaking the calculations are performed by implementing the numerically computed stresses in the api and dnv guidelines see eqs 1 and 2 for the case of the multiple interfaces scheme for which the interface stress distribution follows that of the adjacent soil the pre shaking and post shaking pullout capacities are estimated to be 23600 kn and 2540 kn respectively with the latter being significantly decreased as a result of soil liquefaction fig 4c compared to the above the use of mohr coulomb elements captures quite accurately the pre shaking capacity but significantly overestimates the post seismic capacity at 23500 kn the use of a single interface element also provides a consistent estimate of the pre shaking capacity while still failing to capture the post shaking capacity with the corresponding prediction being equal to 8803 kn 3 2 numerical solution sequence the seismic response analysis of the pile tendon floater system is performed in two stages initially the pretension force f 10800 kn is applied statically at the structural node corresponding to the top of the floater in the sequel the displacement of that node is constrained and the input seismic motion is applied at the base of the model the analysis continues beyond the end of shaking until excess pore pressures dissipate completely during this second stage the displacements of the pile head and the floater are continuously monitored along with the loss of tendon pretension and floater buoyancy τo better understand the mechanisms that control the system response it was also necessary to monitor the variation with time during shaking and following excess pore water pressure dissipation of the degraded pullout capacity of the pile when numerically performed this last task may increase the computational effort enormously as it is not part of the main seismic response analysis but it has to be performed independently at regular time intervals based on the ever current stress state around the pile for this reason the static pullout capacity of the pile is computed analytically according to the api api 2014 and dnv dnv 2013 recommendations combined with the liquefaction affected radial stresses at the pile soil interface predicted during the seismic stage of the numerical analysis this semi analytical methodology has been implemented in the numerical analysis through a user defined subroutine written in flac3d s inbuilt programming language fish to provide the continuous with time variation of the pile capacity to sustain the tendon pretension load prior to the application of seismic loading the numerical methodology was first employed to calculate the static i e in the absence of excess pore pressure buildup response of the pile fig 5 presents the numerical load displacement curve for the total load q and the friction resistance q s black and red solid lines respectively computed numerically for an interface friction angle δ 25ο and the reduced due to scouring pile length l 52 m the analysis is performed under drained conditions by applying a constant upward velocity at the free end of the buoyancy spring determined so that inertial effects are minimized also plotted in this figure are the corresponding analytical estimates dashed lines for the ultimate values of q and q s note that for the comparison shown herein the analytical estimates are obtained without considering the cutoff limit for the shaft friction eq 2 since the numerical analyses do not incorporate this effect observe that the numerical and the analytical methodologies are in fairly good agreement with regard to both the ultimate skin friction as well as the ultimate pile capacity 4 liquefaction effects on pile tendon floater response the basic analysis presented herein is performed for location b water depth 120 m assuming that the relative density of the liquefiable layer is d r 50 and that of the underlying non liquefiable sand is d r 90 the permeability is set equal to k 6 6 10 5 m s for both layers based on the results of constant head tests on specimens of nevada sand arulmoli et al 1992 note that the specific soil permeability value is also representative of silty sand formations the single tendon pile support considered in the analysis is attached to a floater with equivalent cross section area a fl 99 51 m2 i e 1 3 of the total while the free length of the tendon is l free 100 m the associated cross section area is a t 0 01327 m2 and the modulus of elasticity is e t 200 gpa according to εqs 3 and 4 the preceding values lead to an axial stiffness k t 62800 kn m and k fl 995 kn m for the tendon and the floater respectively the input seismic motion consists of n 15 uniform acceleration cycles corresponding to a mw 7 5 earthquake with amplitude a max 0 24 g and period t 0 5 sec the results of these analyses are presented and evaluated in the following in order to investigate the mechanisms that govern the response of the soil pile tendon floater system from a design point of view the emphasis is on the degradation of the pile pullout capacity the accumulation of pullout displacements as well as the ensuing effects on the tendon pretension and the stability of the floater 4 1 pile response fig 6 summarizes the response of the pile tendon floater system more specifically fig 6a presents time histories of the pile s pullout capacity q ult and the tendon s force f black and red line respectively both during and after the end of shaking until full excess pore pressure dissipation similarly fig 6b presents the factor of safety against pullout of the pile fs q ult f as well as the stability safety factor fs st a w fl a is the total buoyancy force and w fl is the weight of the floater while fig 6c shows the uplift displacement of the pile head and the floater in order to further verify the semi analytical procedure for the estimation of q ult during and after shaking a set of numerical analyses is performed at selected time instances to compute q ult and compare with the analytical estimates the analyses are performed by restoring the stress and density state from the dynamic analysis at the selected time instance and by applying a vertical upwards displacement at the uppermost cable node corresponding to the head of the floater analyses are performed assuming undrained conditions i e the fluid flow option is switched to off the results of these analyses shown with blue bullets in fig 6a are consistently in good agreement with the corresponding analytical estimates both during and after the end of shaking as shown in fig 6a the pullout capacity of the pile q ult is initially equal to its pre shaking value 23600 kn and starts to decrease immediately after the beginning of shaking as a result of excess pore pressure buildup at approximately t 3 6 3 7 sec q ult becomes less than the pretension force f signifying a factor of safety against pile pullout less than unity fig 6b q ult continues to decrease until the end of shaking at t 8 sec where it reaches a local minimum q ult min 2540 kn corresponding to a degraded factor of safety fs 0 24 this local minimum practically corresponds to the buoyant weight of the pile as the contribution from the side friction is negligible due to the extensive soil liquefaction after the end of shaking and as excess pore pressures start to dissipate and the soil regains its shear strength q ult gradually increases at approximately t 260 sec the factor of safety becomes again larger than unity while at t 3000 sec when the hydrostatic pore pressure distribution has been restored q ult stabilizes it is noteworthy that this final value of q ult 32150 kn is approximately 36 higher than the initial pre shaking pullout capacity value as a result the final pullout factor of safety increases from its initial pre shaking value of fs 2 19 to fs 3 70 this strength gain which is also confirmed by the numerical analyses see blue bullet at t 3000 sec can be attributed to the long term increase in lateral effective stresses that takes place due to shaking and the following soil consolidation this is demonstrated in fig 7 which presents the variation with depth of the effective radial stresses before shaking and at the end of consolidation red and green lines respectively it therefore turns out that the radial stresses at the end of consolidation are considerably increased especially at deeper elevations thus inducing a significantly larger pullout capacity this is a common phenomenon observed also in cyclic laboratory tests e g cyclic oedometer and dss direct simple shear tests attributed to the lateral displacement constraint imposed on the pile soil interface elements by the rigid pile boundary based on the above the following characteristic time instances can be identified with regard to the time histories in fig 6 point a t a 3 6 3 7 sec the factor of safety drops below 1 0 for the first time point b t b 8 0 sec end of shaking when q ult reaches a local minimum approximately equal to the buoyant weight of the pile point c t c 260 sec the factor of safety becomes again larger than 1 0 point d t d 3000 sec end of consolidation when the post shaking pullout capacity stabilizes to a value larger than the initial the evolution of the factor of safety against pullout is the key factor explaining the accumulation of pile displacements more specifically as shown in fig 6c pile displacements are limited to 5 6 cm while the factor of safety remains greater than 1 0 until point a however as long as the fs becomes and remains lower than 1 0 between points a and c the rate of displacement accumulation increases substantially it is noteworthy that at the end of shaking only a fraction of the total pullout displacement has accumulated namely at the end of shaking at point b displacements are approximately equal to 0 24 m and at the end of the failure stage at point c they increase to 2 10 m afterwards between points c and d the factor of safety becomes again larger than 1 0 and pile head displacements stabilize the above observations suggest that the accumulation of pile pullout displacements is primarily influenced by the duration of the failure stage i e the time period during which the factor of safety remains below unity i e t c t a in fig 6b to confirm this finding the numerical analysis was repeated for a tenfold permeability coefficient k 6 6 10 4 m s such as for clean sands and the results are compared with those for the baseline analysis in fig 8 black and red lines respectively in terms of the pullout factor of safety and the pile head displacements observe that in the case of more permeable soil excess pore pressures dissipate faster and consequently the failure stage t c t a is substantially shorter as a result although the co seismic displacements are practically the same the final displacements are substantially decreased from 2 10 m to 0 85 m 4 2 soil response the above patterns are directly associated with the excess pore pressure generation and soil liquefaction in particular fig 9 shows time histories of excess pore pressure ratio r u from the baseline analysis at depths z 1 10 and 40 m below ground surface both at the free field and next to the pile red and black lines respectively in addition fig 10 shows the corresponding excess pore pressure ratio contours at t t b 8 sec i e at the end of shaking and at t t c 260 sec i e when the post seismic factor of safety against pullout becomes greater than unity in order to account for the stress distribution that takes place during shaking the traditional r u definition i e r u δu σ vo is herein adjusted as 5 r u δ u σ v δ u where δu is the generated excess pore pressures and σ v the ever current vertical effective stress focusing first on the co seismic response t 0 8 sec fig 9 shows that complete liquefaction i e r u 0 9 1 0 extends gradually to almost the entire soil mass with the exception of the area around the pile head where the excess pore pressure ratio stabilizes at a peak value of r u 0 5 0 6 fig 9a this non liquefied zone is more clearly illustrated in fig 10a where it forms an inverted cone and extends to a depth of about 4 5 m 1 6 2 0d this type of response can be attributed both to the low effective overburden stresses that prevail at shallow depths which favor a more dilative response as well on the large pile soil relative displacement and the associated shear induced dilation note that a similar soil response has been observed in the past for piles loaded laterally due to liquefaction induced lateral spreading gonzález et al 2009 chaloulos et al 2014 as shown in fig 10a a similar yet narrower zone 1 0 1 5d is formed near the tip presumably due to the suction caused by the detachment of the pile tip from the underlying sand to gain insight on the mechanisms behind this type of response fig 11 presents the stress paths in the form of shear vs vertical effective stress and the corresponding stress strain curves at the free field fig 11a and b and next to the pile fig 11c and d both at a depth of z 1 5 m below the ground surface i e inside the zone of dilative response as shown in fig 11a and b the response at the free field is typical of a soil element undergoing strain controlled undrained cyclic simple shear loading as the seismic loading progresses the vertical effective stress gradually decreases reflecting the soil s tendency to contract after approximately 5 6 loading cycles the vertical effective stress practically becomes equal to zero indicating complete liquefaction of the soil similarly as suggested by the stress strain response the soil stiffness gradually decreases the stress strain loops become gradually more horizontal on the other hand the soil next to the pile exhibits a significantly different type of response as shown in the stress path of fig 11c the soil has an initial static shear stress approximately equal to 2 0 kpa i e a static stress ratio of 2 0 14 0 0 14 as a result of the static pullout of the pile as in the free field case the vertical effective stress initially decreases however after 2 3 loading cycles it starts increasing denoting the soil s tendency to dilate while it temporarily becomes larger than its initial pre shaking value this type of response is also reflected in the stress strain curve fig 11d where the loops appear to demonstrate a hardening type of response post seismically i e at t 8 sec excess pore pressures dissipate primarily towards the ground surface as evidenced in fig 9 and in fig 10b which show that the excess pore pressures at large depths dissipate faster furthermore fig 9 shows that this upward flow causes the pore pressures near the pile head where the soil has not fully liquefied to increase slightly before they also start to dissipate it is also noteworthy that the duration of the dissipation process is disproportionally large compared to the duration of shaking for the baseline case shown herein with a permeability coefficient k 6 6 10 5 m s complete excess pore pressure dissipation does not occur until t 2500 3000 sec while the shaking ends at t 8 sec it is interesting to observe the correlation between the generation of excess pore pressures and the degradation of the pile s pullout capacity namely as shown in fig 6b the factor of safety drops below unity i e at t a 3 6 3 7 sec at the time when the excess pore pressures ratios in fig 9 become significant i e r u 0 6 furthermore the ultimate pullout capacity q ult and the factor of safety fs reach a local minimum at the end of shaking i e at t b 8 0 sec when the bulk of the foundation soil has liquefied fig 10a finally as shown in fig 10b at t t c 260 sec the dissipation process has progressed significantly so that the soil has regained a considerable amount of its shear strength and the factor of safety becomes again larger than unity in this context it would be practical to develop an analytical correlation between the pull out capacity and the excess pore pressure ratio in the vicinity of the pile ru pile however this is not feasible as the value of the latter at the pile soil interface is affected by a large number of soil foundation seismic excitation parameters while it is the result of complex pile soil interaction mechanisms e g pore fluid flow shear induced dilation etc which cannot be incorporated in a simplified analytical relationship 4 3 tendon floater response pullout of the pile causes the floater to move upwards and the tendon to lose part of its elongation and pretension force this is shown in fig 6c which presents the time history of the upward displacement of the floater red line compared to that of the pile head black line observe that the upward displacement evolution of the floater resembles that of the pile head initially until t a it is very limited and afterwards it increases steadily with time until the end of the failure phase i e at t c finally the floater stabilizes to an upward displacement of about 2 06 m that is approximately 4 cm less than the final pile head displacement of 2 10 m thus for the poseidon model tlp examined herein pile head displacement is almost entirely by approximately 98 transmitted to the floater with only a small part corresponding to reduction of the tendon elongation as a result the tension force of the tendon is reduced by approximately 20 from f 10800 kn to approximately f f 8700 kn fig 6a while the stability safety factor of the floater decreases by 10 from fs st o 2 18 to fs st f 1 96 fig 6b it should be noted that the system studied herein employs a relatively short tendon due to the shallow water depth with high tensional stiffness for larger water depths and less stiff tendons the percentage of pile head pullout that is transferred to the floater will substantially decrease leading to higher loss of pretension and platform stability 5 conclusions in summary the following are concluded with regard to the effects of seismic liquefaction on the overall performance of the model tlp system examined in this study a upon complete free field liquefaction the excess pore pressure ratio becomes approximately equal to unity r u 0 9 1 0 along almost the entire pile length significantly lower excess pore pressures r u 0 0 0 6 develop along the top 4 5 m 1 6 2 0d of the pile where the combination of relatively low effective geostatic stresses and large shear strains due to the pullout pile displacements leads to dilation of the sand in contact to the pile b as a result the skin friction resistance of the pile is drastically reduced during shaking and it is almost eliminated when free field liquefaction extends over the entire pile length at that stage the main force resisting the pretension of the tendons is the buoyant weight of the pile thus the minimum degraded factor of safety at the end of shaking was approximately equal to fs 0 24 regardless of the assumed permeability coefficient of the liquefiable seabed soil c the pile resistance to pullout failure increases with dissipation of the excess pore pressures developed during shaking while the associated factor of safety becomes gradually larger than unity it is of special practical interest to note that the long term value of the pullout resistance after complete excess pore pressure dissipation exceeded the initial design value by about 36 this is attributed to the increase of the total and effective radial soil stresses at the pile soil interface caused by seismic shaking d pile head displacements develop essentially within the time period during and after shaking when the factor of safety against static pullout of the pile remains less than unity i e during foundation failure as a result the final pile head displacements were reduced from 2 10 m to 0 85 m when the permeability coefficient of the liquefiable sand was tenfold increased and consequently the period of foundation failure decreased from 250 sec to about 30 sec the displacements are insignificant before and after that time period as long as the factor of safety remains larger than unity e due to the high stiffness of the tendons considered herein relative to the buoyancy stiffness of the platform pile head displacements were almost entirely 98 transmitted to the platform with only a very small part 2 corresponding to reduction of tendon elongation thus the maximum rise of the platform was 2 06 m leading to a 11 0 decrease in the stability factor of safety fs st of the platform while the maximum reduction in the tendon elongation was 4 1 cm leading to a 20 loss of pretension the above observations confirm that earthquake induced liquefaction is not catastrophic for tlp systems as for other bottom fixed support platforms e g gravity base tripod monopile and jacket supporting structures despite the temporary complete loss of soil strength pile head displacements are sustainable and the same applies to the loss of tendon pretension and floater buoyancy which are not likely to jeopardize the overall safety of the platform furthermore the above effects are potentially recoverable as pretension of the tendons can be restored thus ensuring functionality and seismic resilience for the tlp installation nevertheless it should be acknowledged that the basic pile tendon buoy interaction mechanisms identified herein should be further investigated with the aid of parametric analyses for a wide range of design parameters and also verified experimentally of particular interest is the differential rise tilting of the platform which may develop due to lateral soil inhomogeneity and differences in the tendon loads as well as the potentially detrimental effect on the platform stability of any

20213,reliability and performance based design of a riser cluster requires an accurate estimation of the extreme values of the stochastic relative distance between the risers during a given time duration this study presents a comprehensive assessment of six methods for estimating the collision probability between two risers with limited simulation length a pair of steep wave risers in tandem arrangement subjected to combined current and wave loads is modeled the wake effect generated by the upstream riser acting on the downstream riser is considered firstly the critical locations at which collisions during a short duration are likely to occur are identified after obtaining nonlinear riser responses 3 hour short term extreme relative motions are calculated which are used for the collision probability estimation several methods for the extreme value analysis including the gumbel probability paper method the general extreme value method and the average conditional exceedance rate method are presented this paper also proposes two methods which offer reliable and satisfactory results for the extreme value analysis of highly skewed processes keywords riser collision probability riser clusters extreme value analysis current and waves wake effect 1 introduction as the offshore industry moves to deeper water risers are commonly arranged as clusters with small spacing due to limited size of the platform as well as cost considerations the dynamic response of riser clusters induced by waves currents and platform motions becomes complex and this complexity is increased by the arrangement of risers the influence of neighboring risers may lead to hydrodynamic loads on the individual risers which are significantly different from the loads they would experience in isolation this hydrodynamic interference may cause large relative motions between risers resulting in potential collisions rustad et al 2008 for instance when a downstream cylinder is placed within the wake field generated by an upstream cylinder the flow around the downstream cylinder will be changed due to the presence of the upstream one this change will reduce the drag force acting on the downstream cylinder and it also might induce an additional lift force if the cylinders are in a staggered arrangement this wake effect in turn reduces the clearance between the cylinders a literature review on the topic of wake induced oscillation can be found in fu et al 2015 furthermore the differences in excitation force on neighboring risers may cause relative motions to be large resulting in the small clearance between risers additionally the floater motions also affect the motions of the individual risers all these factors may lead to the possibility of riser collision especially when risers are subjected to a severe sea state however relatively few studies have been carried out regarding riser collision considering the wake effect due to the high degree of non linearity time domain analysis is required for the collision assessment problem however it is impractical to simulate collision events because of the limitations of the simulation time and the complication of the contact problem firstly collision is a rare event in practice so for a well designed riser system extremely long simulation periods are usually required for such an event to occur secondly when a clash between risers does occur the motions of individual risers will both be changed which are different from when ignoring the presence of the other riser however simulating the contact and the motions after contact is still a challenge for most of the available software and in general for global dynamic analysis computer algorithms thus the riser collision process represented by the normalized minimum distance between risers is formulated as the main quantity of interest since this is a random process application of extreme value analysis is required many techniques for estimation of the extreme value distribution have been proposed including the gumbel probability paper gpp method gumbel 1958 the generalized extreme value gev method the average conditional exceedance rate acer method næss and gaidai 2009 naess and karpa 2013 karpa and naess 2013 and the method based on the translation process model winterstein 1987 1988 ding and chen 2014 the accuracy and uncertainty associated with these methods are affected by the properties of the process and the modeling adequacy of these properties based on limited data the generalized extreme value method requires a number of time series of equal length and that the maximum value from each time history is extracted with the assumption that these maxima are stochastically independent and identically distributed the extreme value converges to one of three general distribution functions i e gumbel weibull or frechet distributions gumbel 1958 this method requires a large number of simulations in order to obtain a result with acceptable accuracy therefore an alternative method for the estimation of the extreme value distribution based on a limited number of simulations is introduced the acer method expresses the mean level up crossing rate at the upper tail as a function of the level η this makes it possible to avoid the commonly adopted assumption that the extreme value data follow an appropriate asymptotic extreme value distribution næss and gaidai 2009 the translation process method deals with non gaussian processes it translates non gaussian process to standard gaussian process through a monotonic translation function so that the traditional extreme theory for the gaussian process can be applied the translation function can be determined using the statistical moments of the non gaussian process i e the moment based hermite method duggal and niedzwecki 1994 this method was used as the probabilistic collision model for a pair of top tension riser for a given location duggal and niedzwecki 1993 this paper introduces another approach to calculate the translation function by mapping the cdf of the non gaussian process data to a prescribed parent distribution model however in the literature few studies have been carried out for the collision probabilities he and low 2013 leira et al 2002 but most of them do not focus on the extreme value problem the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the performances of the gumbel probability paper method the generalized extreme value method the acer method and two proposed methods in the application of the riser collision probability estimation particular attention is given to a pair of flexible wave risers in tandem arrangement subjected to a combined current and waves flow the wake effect generated by the upstream riser is considered the shortest relative distance between the risers is searched for according to the riser motion for a given time duration the collision probability is then estimated with short term time history samples for the different extreme value analysis methods 2 extreme value analysis 2 1 generalized extreme value distribution the largest maximum for each time history is the highest value among all the local maxima 1 x e max x m 1 x m 2 x m n where x e and x m i i 1 n represent the largest maximum and the individual local maxima from a given time series respectively by assuming that all the individual maxima are stochastically independent and identically distributed with a common distribution function f x m x the distribution of x e is given as bury 1975 2 f x e x p x e x f x m x n it is proven that this equation will normally converge towards one of three types of extreme value distributions as n i e gumbel weibull or frechet bury 1975 these three types of extreme value distributions have a common form i e the generalized extreme value gev distribution given as 3 f x e x exp 1 γ x μ σ 1 γ where μ is the location parameter σ is the scale parameter and γ is the shape parameter the shape parameter strictly affects the shape of the distribution and governs the tail of each distribution the shape parameter is derived from the skewness as it represents where the majority of the data lies here γ 0 corresponds to the frechet distribution and γ 0 corresponds to the reversed weibull distribution note that the reversed weibull distribution is the only type of the extreme value distribution with a finite upper limit furthermore γ 0 is the limiting case when γ 0 which leads to the gumbel distribution in general a distribution with a larger number of fitting parameters will be able to model the input data more accurately than a distribution with a smaller number of parameters however the gumbel distribution is efficient for small sample sizes if the size is greater than 50 gev shows a better overall performance cunnane 1989 2 2 gumbel probability paper method the gumbel model is the most commonly used distribution model for marine structures the cumulative distribution function cdf of the gumbel model is given as 4 f x e x exp exp α x μ where α is the scale parameter and μ is the location parameter the parameters can be determined by fitting a straight line to the data in a gumbel probability paper gpp details can be found by naess and moan 2012 by taking the logarithm of both the left and right hand side of this equation twice the following equation is obtained 5 ln ln f x e x α x μ further by introducing y ln ln f x e x a linear function i e y α x μ is obtained which implies that in a x y axis system the cumulative distribution becomes a straight line then the parameters α and μ can be estimated by least square fitting of the samples to the straight line 2 3 average conditional exceedance rate unlike the above mentioned methods based on the parametric distribution functions the acer method estimates the extreme value distribution by constructing a sequence of non parametric distribution functions i e the acer functions naess and gaidai 2008 næss and gaidai 2009 karpa and naess 2013 gaidai et al 2016 2018 chai et al 2018 here the basic idea of the acer method is summarized as following based on the time series of the individual maxima the extreme value can be expressed as 6 f x e x p k x exp n k 1 ε ˆ x where n is the counted number of maxima during a given time duration t 0 k is the order of the acer function p k is the approximation of the extreme value distribution based on the k th order acer function and ε ˆ x is the empirical acer function of order k which can be determined by applying the existing time series as k increases more complex model the bias of eq 6 will generally reduce but variance will increase in order to predict the extreme value distribution in the upper tail region an extrapolation scheme is applied specifically in the upper tail region e g for x x m 0 where x x m 0 is an appropriately chosen tail marker the acer function behaves similarly to the function exp a x b c where a 0 b x m 0 and c 0 are suitable constants the empirical acer function is assumed to have the form 7 ε ˆ k x q k exp a k x b k c k x x m 0 where a k b k c k and q k are suitable constants which depend on the order k it should be noted that eq 7 is applicable in the upper tail region i e x x m 0 by comparing the empirical ε ˆ k x for different values of k an appropriate value of k is selected to capture the dependence structure of the time series the constants a k b k c k and q k can be determined by minimizing the following mean square error function 8 f q k a k b k c k i 1 n ρ j ln ε ˆ k x m i ln q a x m i b c 2 where x m i i 1 n are levels at which the acer functions have been empirically estimated the weight factor ρ j is given by the relationship ρ j ln c i x m i ln c i x m i 2 where c i represents the 95 confidence interval which can be approximately expressed as 9 c i x m i ε ˆ k x m i 1 1 96 n k 1 ε ˆ k x m i therefore it is seen in eqs 8 and 9 that the weight factor ρ j decreases as the level x m i increases which implies that the extrapolation scheme puts more emphasis on the more reliable data points moreover it should be noted that there is a level x m i beyond which the weight factor ρ j is no longer defined since the c i estimated by eq 9 would be negative as the levels exceed x m i 2 4 proposed method 1 gumbel parameters based on weibull tail fitting of maxima the requirement related to a large number of simulations for the gpp and the gev methods has led to the development of alternative methods for the estimation of the extreme value distribution from a small number of simulations so that the individual maxima from the limited time history can be used for the extreme value estimation one possible model is that if the individual maxima follow the 3 parameter weibull distribution the extreme value which is followed by the gumbel distribution can be determined based on the distribution parameters of the weibull model the 3 parameter weibull distribution function commonly used as a model for individual response maxima is given as 10 f x m x 1 exp x μ σ λ where μ σ and λ are the location scale and shape parameters respectively as recommended those three parameters are determined by the moment method farnes and moan 1993 it is also recommended that only the global maxima i e the largest maxima between positive slope up crossings of the threshold should be selected this method reduces the potential correlation between selected maxima and eliminates the majority of smaller amplitude extremes that are less significant for estimation of extreme values distribution fig 1 illustrates the global maxima which are marked by red color i e x m after obtaining the weibull parameters the extreme value which is assumed to follow the gumbel distribution has the approximated scale and location parameters bury 1975 11 μ x e 0 57722 α x e u σ ln n 1 λ 0 57722 μ ln n 1 λ λ α x e λ σ ln n 1 λ λ where n is the number of global maxima for a given time duration μ x e and α x e are the location and scale parameters of the gumbel distribution function respectively μ σ and λ are weibull distribution parameters as given in eq 10 since the aim of the fitting is to obtain a weibull model to be used for estimation of extremes it is important that the fitting procedure gives a good fit to the upper tail data therefore a threshold value is used so that the effect of the lower tail data below the threshold can be neglected the idea of only considering observations above a threshold value for estimation of parameters in a proposed distribution model has been applied for extreme value prediction of the response of a single flexible riser sodahl 1991 in the present study the weibull tail fitting method will be used the choice of threshold is based on experience in this paper the method for determining the threshold is based on the mean and standard deviation of the original time series for instance for a given 3 h simulation the smallest threshold is set to be the mean value e g x 0 μ x and largest threshold is to be the 1 4 times the standard deviation e g x 0 μ x 1 4 s t d based on the recommendations by moriarty et al 2004 other threshold values are inserted for refinement totally five threshold values are applied i e x 0 μ x η x where η x 0 0 5 1 1 2 1 4 s t d 2 5 proposed method 2 translation process method based on cdf mapping the basic idea of the translation process method is to translate the non gaussian process to a standard gaussian process so that the extreme value distribution of the non gaussian process can be estimated from that of the standard gaussian process the translation function is given by 12 f x x φ u x g u f x 1 φ u where u is the standard gaussian process φ u is the corresponding cdf g is the translation function from the x space to the u space and f x 1 is the inverse function of f x the extreme value distribution is then calculated via the gaussian extreme value theory 13 f x e x exp ν x t exp ν 0 t exp g 1 x 2 2 where ν x is the up crossing rate at a threshold level x which is identical to the mean up crossing rate in the u space at level u g 1 x φ 1 f x x since the translation function is monotonic ν 0 is the zero up crossing rate t is the time duration and g 1 x φ 1 f x x is the inverse translation function therefore an appropriate distribution model f x x which is able to capture the upper tail well is essential in this section a combined distribution model is used so that the behavior of the upper tails can be captured the idea of using a combined distribution model for cdf mapping has been applied by e g peng et al 2014 in this section a different combined distribution model for the upper tail fitting is presented an empirical distribution based on the measured data i e a kernel sampling density is applied in the lower tail probability region and a 3 parameter weibull distribution is applied in the upper tail the details of the kernel sampling density is not given here since this paper is focused on analysis of the extreme value distribution which is governed by the upper tail the expression of the cdf of the upper tail data larger than the tail marker x 0 followed by the weibull distribution is given as 14 f 3 w b x x x x 0 f x x f x x 0 1 f x x 0 where f 3 w b is the cdf of 3 parameter weibull distribution as given in eq 10 and x 0 is the tail marker or threshold and corresponds to the location parameter μ in eq 10 the cdf of the maxima in the upper tail is then calculated by 15 f x x f x k e l x 0 1 f x k e l x 0 f 3 w b x x x 0 where f x k e l x is the cdf of the kernel sampling distribution which is applied for the data smaller than the tail marker x 0 moreover f x x 0 f x k e l x 0 ensuring that the cdf is continuous at x x 0 after determining the distribution model f x x the translation function is established by cdf mapping i e eq 12 3 riser system modeling before further assessment it is necessary to address some challenges related to conducting the riser collision analysis firstly the wake effect significantly influences the relative distance between risers however application of the wake models in the finite element software is still a challenge secondly even though there are many existing methods for extreme value estimation it is still a challenge to find a suitable definition of a random variable to describe the stochastic properties of the riser collision problem in this section these aspects will be addressed by examining a pair of risers in a steep wave configuration subjected to combined current plus waves time domain simulation is necessary for calculating the non linear riser response under combined current and wave loads especially the non linearity is increased when the wake effect is taken into account the wake effect is considered by combining the finite element software riflex 1987 along with the blevins wake model blevins 2005 the riflex is specially designed to handle static and dynamic analyses of slender marine structures the blevins wake model expresses the drag and lift forces on the downstream riser as a function of the relative distance between risers 3 1 description of riser system the semi submersible floater is modeled as a rigid body and the motion of the floater is specified through the linear motion transfer functions in 6 degrees of freedom dofs amplitudes and phase angles at the center of gravity are presented in fig 2 for the surge motion the risers in the steep wave configuration are illustrated in fig 3 each of the risers have a total length of 160 m with a diameter of 0 25 m the buoyancy elements are attached along the riser over a length of 50 m with a diameter of 0 63 m starting 10 m from the lower end the main riser properties are summarized in table 1 the initial relative distance between the top ends of riser is l 0 10 m the water depth is 100 m 3 2 environmental conditions the wave condition is described by a jonswap wave spectrum with a peak factor of η 3 3 a significant wave height h s 14 m and a peak period t p 18 s in addition a linearly decreasing current with surface velocity v c 1 m s and seabed velocity v c 0 8 m s has been included both waves and current are perpendicular to the risers 3 3 hydrodynamic forces in riflex the hydrodynamic forces are calculated based on two dimensional strip theory the wave induced excitation forces froude krylov and diffraction forces are computed by a long wavelength approximation which involves added mass and potential damping of the actual cross section together with the wave kinematics for a slender structure the main component of the hydrodynamic forces is the viscous drag force the viscous load is computed using the drag term in the modified morison equation taking into account the relative motion between the riser and the fluid flow the morison equation per unit length is expressed as 16 f t 1 2 c d d v t x t v t x t ρ c m π 4 d 2 v t ρ c m 1 π 4 d 2 x t where ρ is the water density c d and c m are the drag and inertia coefficients respectively v and v are the water fluid velocity and acceleration respectively x and ẍ are the riser velocity and acceleration respectively for current plus wave flow v is given as a superposition of current and wave orbital velocities 3 4 wake model the wake effect generated by the upstream riser needs to be accounted for usually the wake effect is translated into a reduced flow velocity over the downstream riser in this study the wake model developed by blevins 2005 is used by which the reduction of the local flow velocity over the downstream cylinder is transformed to the reduction of the drag coefficient the formula is given as 17 c d l t c d 0 1 k 1 c d 0 d u l exp k 2 t 2 c d 0 d u l 2 where l t is the longitude and transverse locations of the downstream cylinder with respect to the upstream cylinder c d is the downstream cylinder drag coefficient based on the local flow velocity c d 0 is the reference drag coefficient based on the undisturbed flow velocity d u is the diameter of the upstream cylinder the parameters k 1 1 and k 2 4 5 are constants and determined by fitting curve to the experimental data at l d 3 5 9 and 20 3 using the least squares method price and paidoussis 1984 however more data is required in order to validate this model the blevins model also comprises an inward lift force on the downstream cylinder towards the wake center line the lift force is proportional to the transverse gradient of the drag force according to the rawlins postulate in the present study however the downstream riser is placed at the wake center line so that the lift force caused by the asymmetry flow can be neglected actually the blevins model is valid for a relative distance between the centers of cylinders larger than 2 3 times the diameter of the upstream cylinder at distances less than this value the interference becomes more complex with a negative suction force involved more details about the lift force induced by the wake effect are given in blevins 2005 for the inertia force a typical value of 2 is used for the inertia coefficient and it is considered independent of the relative distance the upstream riser is considered as a single and isolated cylinder and the hydrodynamic force is also considered to be independent of the relative distance 3 5 time domain simulation the time domain simulations are conducted by using the commercial finite element analysis software riflex where each riser is modeled by means of line elements riflex is specially designed to handle static and dynamic analyses of flexible risers and other slender structures the static analysis methods comprise catenary analysis available for a limited range of systems the dynamic analysis methods comprise linear and nonlinear time domain analysis the wake effect in steady current is firstly considered in the static analysis since the drag force acting on the downstream riser depends on the response i e the relative distance between risers an iteration procedure is necessary for determining the final static equilibrium deflection however riflex does not have the functionality to give a varying c d x as input and therefore such a representation is achieved by combining riflex with an automatic workflow developed by the author firstly riflex runs a static analysis based on the initial distance and calculates the relative distance between two segments then the shortest relative distance x and the associated c d x is computed the workflow generates new input files and automatically calls riflex for a new analysis this procedure is repeated until a converge is achieved the risers equilibrium static position is then determined more details about the implementation of the wake model in the static analysis can be found in fu et al 2017 the 3 h dynamic responses of the risers have been simulated 50 times with different random seeds for generating time series of waves when computing the dynamic response of interacting risers the calculated c d for the downstream riser obtained from the static analysis is applied in the dynamic analysis 3 6 definition of random process the relative distance is essential for estimating the riser collision probability the basic principle for calculating the relative distance is that each riser is modeled as a line represented by a series of line segments according to their properties and geometries each segment comprises a series of beam elements for each pair of segments the minimum distance can be checked element by element at each time step this check is carried out for all combinations of elements until the point with the smallest distance is detected within the segments this calculated minimum relative distance is taken as the random process which can be used further for extreme value analysis however it is convenient to transform the extreme minimum value problem to the non dimensional extreme maximum value problem by introducing the following process 18 x t l t d where l t is the minimum center to center distance between two critical segments at time t in this case x t 0 and the risers physically collide when x t 1 fig 4 compares the time history of x t with the corresponding maxima and l t with the corresponding minima 3 7 identification of critical segments as mentioned the shortest distance between each pair of segments is checked element by element at each time step this check is carried out for all combinations of elements until the point of smallest distance is detected within the segments which is very time consuming especially if the simulation duration is long and the number of elements is large this procedure also implies that the exact location of shortest distance might change at each time step however it should be noted that some element combinations may not be relevant for calculation of the shortest distance therefore some critical segments where the collisions are likely to occur can initially be identified a 10 min simulation is preformed in order to find the critical segments along the risers the minimum distance is checked element by element in riflex sintef 2017 the locations where the minimum distance occurs are recorded as illustrated in fig 5 the blue and orange circles are the critical dynamic locations of the upstream and downstream risers respectively the static equilibrium deflection shapes are plotted in the same figure and the buoyancy modules are presented by the green lines it is found from the figure that there are three segments which have high risk of collision indicated as s 1 s 2 and s 3 more details for identification of critical segments can be found in fu et al 2017 4 comparison of different methods the assessment of the different methods for estimation of the extreme values will be done based on the data obtained from the 50 3 h simulations conducted in section 3 table 2 summarizes the first four moments of the random process x defined in eq 18 for different critical segments i e the mean standard deviation std skewness and kurtosis the coefficients of variations covs of these statistical moments are also shown in the same table the cov is defined as the ratio between the std and the mean value denoting the variation of estimation from each short term simulation generally the higher statistical moments present larger variations it should be noted that the skewness of x is negative indicating that the lower tail of the distribution x is longer from the table it also appears that the smallest mean value is found for s2 indicating a higher probability of collision at s2 it is also found that even though the segment s3 has the largest mean value it gives the largest std indicating a high risk of collision the statistics of the global maxima from the 50 3 h simulations i e x m are summarized in table 3 including the first four moments and the associated covs for different thresholds the mean value and std of the extreme value i e x e estimated from 50 3 h simulations are given in table 4 4 1 gpp and gev method the extreme values extracted from the 50 3 h simulations are assumed to be gev distributed the distribution parameters are determined by using the maximum likelihood estimates anderson and mathématicien 1958 in order to compare with the gumbel model the results for segments s 1 s 2 and s 3 obtained from the gev model are plotted in the gumbel probability paper in fig 6 the associated distribution parameters and the 3 h collision probabilities i e p f 3 h 1 f x e 3 h are summarized in table 5 from the results it is found that the fitted curves are nearly straight lines and the shape parameter γ is quite close to zero which is desired for practical application of the 2 parameter gumbel distribution instead of the 3 parameter gev distribution therefore in the following sections the gpp method will be used as a reference method for benchmarking the results of the other ones fig 7 presents the fitted gumbel distributions in the gumbel probability paper by applying the least square fitting method table 6 lists the associated distribution parameters and the calculated 3 h collision probabilities the results show that collision most likely occurs for s2 and the probability to have a collision at s1 is much lower 4 2 threshold and tail marker proposed method 1 pm1 as mentioned previously five different thresholds are investigated in this section i e x 0 μ x 0 0 5 1 1 2 1 4 s t d fig 8 presents an example of the selected global maxima with threshold x 0 μ x s t d which are identified from one 3 h time history sample fig 9 shows the estimated maxima and extreme distributions of one 3 h time history for different threshold values in terms of the probability of exceedance i e p f 3 h 1 f x e 3 h the estimated weibull distributions of the global maxima are illustrated in fig 9 a the estimated gumbel distributions of the extreme values are presented in fig 9 b the empirical extremes extracted from 50 3 h simulations are plotted in the same figure from fig 9 it appears that the choice of threshold has a significant effect on the statistics and the shape of the distribution the lower threshold values i e η 0 and η 0 5 s t d preserve the largest number of maxima from the time series however the distribution is heavily weighted to lower values and the fitted distribution does not agree well for the upper tail data as the threshold value increases i e η 1 2 s t d and η 1 4 s t d the weight of the upper tail data becomes important but the amount of data is reduced from the results it is found that η s t d captures most numbers of the extreme value data for the present study therefore the threshold η s t d will be adopted when the weibull tail fitting method pm1 is applied proposed method 2 pm2 for the translation process method based on cfd mapping of a combined parent distribution pm2 the tail marker is also important fig 10 a shows the translation functions of the pm2 with different tail markers i e η 0 0 5 1 0 1 2 1 4 s t d generally it is observed from the figure that for this highly skewed non gaussian processes the pm2 method can give a reliable estimation in the upper tail region the cdf mapping gives acceptable estimates as the upper tail behavior is well captured from fig 10 b it appears that there are more extremes to be captured as the tail marker increasing however the increase of η from η s t d to a higher value does not change the results significantly thus η s t d is considered to be adequate for extreme estimation acer regarding the acer methods the empirical acer functions ε ˆ k x for different orders of k are given in fig 11 a which are based on the data from the 50 3 h histories it appears that for the lower range of the individual maxima there is a noticeable variation of the empirical acer functions for different orders of k which implies a significant effect of dependence between the data points however the result is almost not affected by a further increase of k when k 2 in the upper range which means that there is no dependence effects that need to be accounted for thus k 2 is considered to be adequate for the estimation of extremes the advantage of the case with the second order empirical acer function is that the result is the most accurately estimated one because most data are available for its estimation the estimation of acer functions requires a better fitting of ε ˆ k x at higher thresholds and the estimation is not sensitive to the initial tail marker therefore the tail marker η σ is chosen which is consistent with the selection for the previous tail fitting method fig 11 b presents the empirical function ε ˆ 2 x and its 95 ci obtained from the time series as well as the estimated acer function in the upper tail region and the corresponding estimated 95 ci provided by the extrapolation scheme 4 3 comparison of different methods due to the statistical uncertainties which are inherent in the stochastic response process repeated simulations are required in order to obtain a reliable estimation when the methods pm1 and pm2 are applied the distribution of the extreme value is determined based on the averages of the expected value and the standard deviation for each simulation given by 19 e x e 1 n i 1 n e i x e s t d x e 1 n 1 i 1 n e i x e e x e 1 2 where n is the number of the time histories provided by the simulations and e i x e is the expected value for simulation number i as mentioned previously the purpose of this paper is to estimate the extreme value distribution by using limited data fig 12 illustrates the collision probability for the different methods at s2 versus the number of simulations n the threshold value for the acer the pm1 and the pm2 methods is chosen as η s t d according to the previous discussion generally it appears that the gpp and gev methods give slightly higher collision probabilities compared with the other methods due to the fact that the results are estimated by fitting to the largest maxima regarding the convergence it appears that the results obtained by applying the pm2 the acer and the gpp are almost not affected by a further increase of n when n 20 when the data is limited e g n 15 the accuracy of the gpp method is significantly influenced by the number of simulations while the pm2 and the acer methods are able to give an acceptable result when the data is limited finally the estimated extreme value distributions in terms of probability of exceedance for the three critical segments are shown in fig 13 the extracted 50 extreme samples are plotted in the same figure from the figure it also appears that all the methods are able to capture most of the largest maxima for all three segments for segment s1 it appears that the risk of collision is significantly lower and the extreme samples are not good enough to predict the collision events the collision probabilities for different methods are given in table 7 as expected both segments s2 and s3 give higher risk of collision due to the smallest mean value or the largest std of relative distance respectively fig 13 c shows that the collision probabilities obtained from pm1 and pm2 agree well with the results obtained from gpp and gev for the segment s3 which indicates the potential applicability of the proposed methods however fig 13 b illustrates that the methods pm1 and pm2 result in lower collision probabilities compared with the methods gpp and gev this is partly due to the dependence between the selected maxima compared with segment s3 the relative distance for segment s2 shows a stronger non gaussian behavior even when the global maxima are used the dependence between the maxima especially the small maxima decreases the weighting of the larger maxima leading to a lower collision probability unfortunately the acer method fails to give a satisfactory estimation because it is not able to capture the largest extreme values a possible reason is that the weighting of the smaller maxima is too high the results also emphasize the importance of the tail marker 5 conclusions this paper evaluated the performance of different methods for the short term extreme value analysis for the riser collision problem a pair of tandem arrangement risers in a steep wave configuration subjected to combined current and wave loads are modeled the blevins wake model is used to calculate the reduced drag force caused by the wake effect the minimum relative distance between the risers is computed at each time step the random process is obtained by changing the sign of the minimum distance in order to deal with the maxima extreme value problem the performance of the gumbel probability paper method the generalized extreme value method the average conditional exceedance rate method and the two proposed methods i e the gumbel method based on weibull tail fitting of maxima and the translation process method based on a combined parent distribution are evaluated the results show that the gumbel distribution is a good model for the estimation of the riser collision probability when a large number of simulations are available however the proposed method pm2 which is based on the cdf mapping of the combined distribution gave a satisfactory estimation when the amount of data is limited the proposed method 1 pm1 also resulted in a good prediction with limited data in the present study the potential weaknesses and strengths of the proposed methods are given however a wider range of collision scenarios need to be studied in order to further validate the methods it should be noted that the selection of an appropriate threshold value has a significant effect on the weibull tail fitting the performance of the acer method is somewhat unstable for the present study credit

20213,reliability and performance based design of a riser cluster requires an accurate estimation of the extreme values of the stochastic relative distance between the risers during a given time duration this study presents a comprehensive assessment of six methods for estimating the collision probability between two risers with limited simulation length a pair of steep wave risers in tandem arrangement subjected to combined current and wave loads is modeled the wake effect generated by the upstream riser acting on the downstream riser is considered firstly the critical locations at which collisions during a short duration are likely to occur are identified after obtaining nonlinear riser responses 3 hour short term extreme relative motions are calculated which are used for the collision probability estimation several methods for the extreme value analysis including the gumbel probability paper method the general extreme value method and the average conditional exceedance rate method are presented this paper also proposes two methods which offer reliable and satisfactory results for the extreme value analysis of highly skewed processes keywords riser collision probability riser clusters extreme value analysis current and waves wake effect 1 introduction as the offshore industry moves to deeper water risers are commonly arranged as clusters with small spacing due to limited size of the platform as well as cost considerations the dynamic response of riser clusters induced by waves currents and platform motions becomes complex and this complexity is increased by the arrangement of risers the influence of neighboring risers may lead to hydrodynamic loads on the individual risers which are significantly different from the loads they would experience in isolation this hydrodynamic interference may cause large relative motions between risers resulting in potential collisions rustad et al 2008 for instance when a downstream cylinder is placed within the wake field generated by an upstream cylinder the flow around the downstream cylinder will be changed due to the presence of the upstream one this change will reduce the drag force acting on the downstream cylinder and it also might induce an additional lift force if the cylinders are in a staggered arrangement this wake effect in turn reduces the clearance between the cylinders a literature review on the topic of wake induced oscillation can be found in fu et al 2015 furthermore the differences in excitation force on neighboring risers may cause relative motions to be large resulting in the small clearance between risers additionally the floater motions also affect the motions of the individual risers all these factors may lead to the possibility of riser collision especially when risers are subjected to a severe sea state however relatively few studies have been carried out regarding riser collision considering the wake effect due to the high degree of non linearity time domain analysis is required for the collision assessment problem however it is impractical to simulate collision events because of the limitations of the simulation time and the complication of the contact problem firstly collision is a rare event in practice so for a well designed riser system extremely long simulation periods are usually required for such an event to occur secondly when a clash between risers does occur the motions of individual risers will both be changed which are different from when ignoring the presence of the other riser however simulating the contact and the motions after contact is still a challenge for most of the available software and in general for global dynamic analysis computer algorithms thus the riser collision process represented by the normalized minimum distance between risers is formulated as the main quantity of interest since this is a random process application of extreme value analysis is required many techniques for estimation of the extreme value distribution have been proposed including the gumbel probability paper gpp method gumbel 1958 the generalized extreme value gev method the average conditional exceedance rate acer method næss and gaidai 2009 naess and karpa 2013 karpa and naess 2013 and the method based on the translation process model winterstein 1987 1988 ding and chen 2014 the accuracy and uncertainty associated with these methods are affected by the properties of the process and the modeling adequacy of these properties based on limited data the generalized extreme value method requires a number of time series of equal length and that the maximum value from each time history is extracted with the assumption that these maxima are stochastically independent and identically distributed the extreme value converges to one of three general distribution functions i e gumbel weibull or frechet distributions gumbel 1958 this method requires a large number of simulations in order to obtain a result with acceptable accuracy therefore an alternative method for the estimation of the extreme value distribution based on a limited number of simulations is introduced the acer method expresses the mean level up crossing rate at the upper tail as a function of the level η this makes it possible to avoid the commonly adopted assumption that the extreme value data follow an appropriate asymptotic extreme value distribution næss and gaidai 2009 the translation process method deals with non gaussian processes it translates non gaussian process to standard gaussian process through a monotonic translation function so that the traditional extreme theory for the gaussian process can be applied the translation function can be determined using the statistical moments of the non gaussian process i e the moment based hermite method duggal and niedzwecki 1994 this method was used as the probabilistic collision model for a pair of top tension riser for a given location duggal and niedzwecki 1993 this paper introduces another approach to calculate the translation function by mapping the cdf of the non gaussian process data to a prescribed parent distribution model however in the literature few studies have been carried out for the collision probabilities he and low 2013 leira et al 2002 but most of them do not focus on the extreme value problem the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the performances of the gumbel probability paper method the generalized extreme value method the acer method and two proposed methods in the application of the riser collision probability estimation particular attention is given to a pair of flexible wave risers in tandem arrangement subjected to a combined current and waves flow the wake effect generated by the upstream riser is considered the shortest relative distance between the risers is searched for according to the riser motion for a given time duration the collision probability is then estimated with short term time history samples for the different extreme value analysis methods 2 extreme value analysis 2 1 generalized extreme value distribution the largest maximum for each time history is the highest value among all the local maxima 1 x e max x m 1 x m 2 x m n where x e and x m i i 1 n represent the largest maximum and the individual local maxima from a given time series respectively by assuming that all the individual maxima are stochastically independent and identically distributed with a common distribution function f x m x the distribution of x e is given as bury 1975 2 f x e x p x e x f x m x n it is proven that this equation will normally converge towards one of three types of extreme value distributions as n i e gumbel weibull or frechet bury 1975 these three types of extreme value distributions have a common form i e the generalized extreme value gev distribution given as 3 f x e x exp 1 γ x μ σ 1 γ where μ is the location parameter σ is the scale parameter and γ is the shape parameter the shape parameter strictly affects the shape of the distribution and governs the tail of each distribution the shape parameter is derived from the skewness as it represents where the majority of the data lies here γ 0 corresponds to the frechet distribution and γ 0 corresponds to the reversed weibull distribution note that the reversed weibull distribution is the only type of the extreme value distribution with a finite upper limit furthermore γ 0 is the limiting case when γ 0 which leads to the gumbel distribution in general a distribution with a larger number of fitting parameters will be able to model the input data more accurately than a distribution with a smaller number of parameters however the gumbel distribution is efficient for small sample sizes if the size is greater than 50 gev shows a better overall performance cunnane 1989 2 2 gumbel probability paper method the gumbel model is the most commonly used distribution model for marine structures the cumulative distribution function cdf of the gumbel model is given as 4 f x e x exp exp α x μ where α is the scale parameter and μ is the location parameter the parameters can be determined by fitting a straight line to the data in a gumbel probability paper gpp details can be found by naess and moan 2012 by taking the logarithm of both the left and right hand side of this equation twice the following equation is obtained 5 ln ln f x e x α x μ further by introducing y ln ln f x e x a linear function i e y α x μ is obtained which implies that in a x y axis system the cumulative distribution becomes a straight line then the parameters α and μ can be estimated by least square fitting of the samples to the straight line 2 3 average conditional exceedance rate unlike the above mentioned methods based on the parametric distribution functions the acer method estimates the extreme value distribution by constructing a sequence of non parametric distribution functions i e the acer functions naess and gaidai 2008 næss and gaidai 2009 karpa and naess 2013 gaidai et al 2016 2018 chai et al 2018 here the basic idea of the acer method is summarized as following based on the time series of the individual maxima the extreme value can be expressed as 6 f x e x p k x exp n k 1 ε ˆ x where n is the counted number of maxima during a given time duration t 0 k is the order of the acer function p k is the approximation of the extreme value distribution based on the k th order acer function and ε ˆ x is the empirical acer function of order k which can be determined by applying the existing time series as k increases more complex model the bias of eq 6 will generally reduce but variance will increase in order to predict the extreme value distribution in the upper tail region an extrapolation scheme is applied specifically in the upper tail region e g for x x m 0 where x x m 0 is an appropriately chosen tail marker the acer function behaves similarly to the function exp a x b c where a 0 b x m 0 and c 0 are suitable constants the empirical acer function is assumed to have the form 7 ε ˆ k x q k exp a k x b k c k x x m 0 where a k b k c k and q k are suitable constants which depend on the order k it should be noted that eq 7 is applicable in the upper tail region i e x x m 0 by comparing the empirical ε ˆ k x for different values of k an appropriate value of k is selected to capture the dependence structure of the time series the constants a k b k c k and q k can be determined by minimizing the following mean square error function 8 f q k a k b k c k i 1 n ρ j ln ε ˆ k x m i ln q a x m i b c 2 where x m i i 1 n are levels at which the acer functions have been empirically estimated the weight factor ρ j is given by the relationship ρ j ln c i x m i ln c i x m i 2 where c i represents the 95 confidence interval which can be approximately expressed as 9 c i x m i ε ˆ k x m i 1 1 96 n k 1 ε ˆ k x m i therefore it is seen in eqs 8 and 9 that the weight factor ρ j decreases as the level x m i increases which implies that the extrapolation scheme puts more emphasis on the more reliable data points moreover it should be noted that there is a level x m i beyond which the weight factor ρ j is no longer defined since the c i estimated by eq 9 would be negative as the levels exceed x m i 2 4 proposed method 1 gumbel parameters based on weibull tail fitting of maxima the requirement related to a large number of simulations for the gpp and the gev methods has led to the development of alternative methods for the estimation of the extreme value distribution from a small number of simulations so that the individual maxima from the limited time history can be used for the extreme value estimation one possible model is that if the individual maxima follow the 3 parameter weibull distribution the extreme value which is followed by the gumbel distribution can be determined based on the distribution parameters of the weibull model the 3 parameter weibull distribution function commonly used as a model for individual response maxima is given as 10 f x m x 1 exp x μ σ λ where μ σ and λ are the location scale and shape parameters respectively as recommended those three parameters are determined by the moment method farnes and moan 1993 it is also recommended that only the global maxima i e the largest maxima between positive slope up crossings of the threshold should be selected this method reduces the potential correlation between selected maxima and eliminates the majority of smaller amplitude extremes that are less significant for estimation of extreme values distribution fig 1 illustrates the global maxima which are marked by red color i e x m after obtaining the weibull parameters the extreme value which is assumed to follow the gumbel distribution has the approximated scale and location parameters bury 1975 11 μ x e 0 57722 α x e u σ ln n 1 λ 0 57722 μ ln n 1 λ λ α x e λ σ ln n 1 λ λ where n is the number of global maxima for a given time duration μ x e and α x e are the location and scale parameters of the gumbel distribution function respectively μ σ and λ are weibull distribution parameters as given in eq 10 since the aim of the fitting is to obtain a weibull model to be used for estimation of extremes it is important that the fitting procedure gives a good fit to the upper tail data therefore a threshold value is used so that the effect of the lower tail data below the threshold can be neglected the idea of only considering observations above a threshold value for estimation of parameters in a proposed distribution model has been applied for extreme value prediction of the response of a single flexible riser sodahl 1991 in the present study the weibull tail fitting method will be used the choice of threshold is based on experience in this paper the method for determining the threshold is based on the mean and standard deviation of the original time series for instance for a given 3 h simulation the smallest threshold is set to be the mean value e g x 0 μ x and largest threshold is to be the 1 4 times the standard deviation e g x 0 μ x 1 4 s t d based on the recommendations by moriarty et al 2004 other threshold values are inserted for refinement totally five threshold values are applied i e x 0 μ x η x where η x 0 0 5 1 1 2 1 4 s t d 2 5 proposed method 2 translation process method based on cdf mapping the basic idea of the translation process method is to translate the non gaussian process to a standard gaussian process so that the extreme value distribution of the non gaussian process can be estimated from that of the standard gaussian process the translation function is given by 12 f x x φ u x g u f x 1 φ u where u is the standard gaussian process φ u is the corresponding cdf g is the translation function from the x space to the u space and f x 1 is the inverse function of f x the extreme value distribution is then calculated via the gaussian extreme value theory 13 f x e x exp ν x t exp ν 0 t exp g 1 x 2 2 where ν x is the up crossing rate at a threshold level x which is identical to the mean up crossing rate in the u space at level u g 1 x φ 1 f x x since the translation function is monotonic ν 0 is the zero up crossing rate t is the time duration and g 1 x φ 1 f x x is the inverse translation function therefore an appropriate distribution model f x x which is able to capture the upper tail well is essential in this section a combined distribution model is used so that the behavior of the upper tails can be captured the idea of using a combined distribution model for cdf mapping has been applied by e g peng et al 2014 in this section a different combined distribution model for the upper tail fitting is presented an empirical distribution based on the measured data i e a kernel sampling density is applied in the lower tail probability region and a 3 parameter weibull distribution is applied in the upper tail the details of the kernel sampling density is not given here since this paper is focused on analysis of the extreme value distribution which is governed by the upper tail the expression of the cdf of the upper tail data larger than the tail marker x 0 followed by the weibull distribution is given as 14 f 3 w b x x x x 0 f x x f x x 0 1 f x x 0 where f 3 w b is the cdf of 3 parameter weibull distribution as given in eq 10 and x 0 is the tail marker or threshold and corresponds to the location parameter μ in eq 10 the cdf of the maxima in the upper tail is then calculated by 15 f x x f x k e l x 0 1 f x k e l x 0 f 3 w b x x x 0 where f x k e l x is the cdf of the kernel sampling distribution which is applied for the data smaller than the tail marker x 0 moreover f x x 0 f x k e l x 0 ensuring that the cdf is continuous at x x 0 after determining the distribution model f x x the translation function is established by cdf mapping i e eq 12 3 riser system modeling before further assessment it is necessary to address some challenges related to conducting the riser collision analysis firstly the wake effect significantly influences the relative distance between risers however application of the wake models in the finite element software is still a challenge secondly even though there are many existing methods for extreme value estimation it is still a challenge to find a suitable definition of a random variable to describe the stochastic properties of the riser collision problem in this section these aspects will be addressed by examining a pair of risers in a steep wave configuration subjected to combined current plus waves time domain simulation is necessary for calculating the non linear riser response under combined current and wave loads especially the non linearity is increased when the wake effect is taken into account the wake effect is considered by combining the finite element software riflex 1987 along with the blevins wake model blevins 2005 the riflex is specially designed to handle static and dynamic analyses of slender marine structures the blevins wake model expresses the drag and lift forces on the downstream riser as a function of the relative distance between risers 3 1 description of riser system the semi submersible floater is modeled as a rigid body and the motion of the floater is specified through the linear motion transfer functions in 6 degrees of freedom dofs amplitudes and phase angles at the center of gravity are presented in fig 2 for the surge motion the risers in the steep wave configuration are illustrated in fig 3 each of the risers have a total length of 160 m with a diameter of 0 25 m the buoyancy elements are attached along the riser over a length of 50 m with a diameter of 0 63 m starting 10 m from the lower end the main riser properties are summarized in table 1 the initial relative distance between the top ends of riser is l 0 10 m the water depth is 100 m 3 2 environmental conditions the wave condition is described by a jonswap wave spectrum with a peak factor of η 3 3 a significant wave height h s 14 m and a peak period t p 18 s in addition a linearly decreasing current with surface velocity v c 1 m s and seabed velocity v c 0 8 m s has been included both waves and current are perpendicular to the risers 3 3 hydrodynamic forces in riflex the hydrodynamic forces are calculated based on two dimensional strip theory the wave induced excitation forces froude krylov and diffraction forces are computed by a long wavelength approximation which involves added mass and potential damping of the actual cross section together with the wave kinematics for a slender structure the main component of the hydrodynamic forces is the viscous drag force the viscous load is computed using the drag term in the modified morison equation taking into account the relative motion between the riser and the fluid flow the morison equation per unit length is expressed as 16 f t 1 2 c d d v t x t v t x t ρ c m π 4 d 2 v t ρ c m 1 π 4 d 2 x t where ρ is the water density c d and c m are the drag and inertia coefficients respectively v and v are the water fluid velocity and acceleration respectively x and ẍ are the riser velocity and acceleration respectively for current plus wave flow v is given as a superposition of current and wave orbital velocities 3 4 wake model the wake effect generated by the upstream riser needs to be accounted for usually the wake effect is translated into a reduced flow velocity over the downstream riser in this study the wake model developed by blevins 2005 is used by which the reduction of the local flow velocity over the downstream cylinder is transformed to the reduction of the drag coefficient the formula is given as 17 c d l t c d 0 1 k 1 c d 0 d u l exp k 2 t 2 c d 0 d u l 2 where l t is the longitude and transverse locations of the downstream cylinder with respect to the upstream cylinder c d is the downstream cylinder drag coefficient based on the local flow velocity c d 0 is the reference drag coefficient based on the undisturbed flow velocity d u is the diameter of the upstream cylinder the parameters k 1 1 and k 2 4 5 are constants and determined by fitting curve to the experimental data at l d 3 5 9 and 20 3 using the least squares method price and paidoussis 1984 however more data is required in order to validate this model the blevins model also comprises an inward lift force on the downstream cylinder towards the wake center line the lift force is proportional to the transverse gradient of the drag force according to the rawlins postulate in the present study however the downstream riser is placed at the wake center line so that the lift force caused by the asymmetry flow can be neglected actually the blevins model is valid for a relative distance between the centers of cylinders larger than 2 3 times the diameter of the upstream cylinder at distances less than this value the interference becomes more complex with a negative suction force involved more details about the lift force induced by the wake effect are given in blevins 2005 for the inertia force a typical value of 2 is used for the inertia coefficient and it is considered independent of the relative distance the upstream riser is considered as a single and isolated cylinder and the hydrodynamic force is also considered to be independent of the relative distance 3 5 time domain simulation the time domain simulations are conducted by using the commercial finite element analysis software riflex where each riser is modeled by means of line elements riflex is specially designed to handle static and dynamic analyses of flexible risers and other slender structures the static analysis methods comprise catenary analysis available for a limited range of systems the dynamic analysis methods comprise linear and nonlinear time domain analysis the wake effect in steady current is firstly considered in the static analysis since the drag force acting on the downstream riser depends on the response i e the relative distance between risers an iteration procedure is necessary for determining the final static equilibrium deflection however riflex does not have the functionality to give a varying c d x as input and therefore such a representation is achieved by combining riflex with an automatic workflow developed by the author firstly riflex runs a static analysis based on the initial distance and calculates the relative distance between two segments then the shortest relative distance x and the associated c d x is computed the workflow generates new input files and automatically calls riflex for a new analysis this procedure is repeated until a converge is achieved the risers equilibrium static position is then determined more details about the implementation of the wake model in the static analysis can be found in fu et al 2017 the 3 h dynamic responses of the risers have been simulated 50 times with different random seeds for generating time series of waves when computing the dynamic response of interacting risers the calculated c d for the downstream riser obtained from the static analysis is applied in the dynamic analysis 3 6 definition of random process the relative distance is essential for estimating the riser collision probability the basic principle for calculating the relative distance is that each riser is modeled as a line represented by a series of line segments according to their properties and geometries each segment comprises a series of beam elements for each pair of segments the minimum distance can be checked element by element at each time step this check is carried out for all combinations of elements until the point with the smallest distance is detected within the segments this calculated minimum relative distance is taken as the random process which can be used further for extreme value analysis however it is convenient to transform the extreme minimum value problem to the non dimensional extreme maximum value problem by introducing the following process 18 x t l t d where l t is the minimum center to center distance between two critical segments at time t in this case x t 0 and the risers physically collide when x t 1 fig 4 compares the time history of x t with the corresponding maxima and l t with the corresponding minima 3 7 identification of critical segments as mentioned the shortest distance between each pair of segments is checked element by element at each time step this check is carried out for all combinations of elements until the point of smallest distance is detected within the segments which is very time consuming especially if the simulation duration is long and the number of elements is large this procedure also implies that the exact location of shortest distance might change at each time step however it should be noted that some element combinations may not be relevant for calculation of the shortest distance therefore some critical segments where the collisions are likely to occur can initially be identified a 10 min simulation is preformed in order to find the critical segments along the risers the minimum distance is checked element by element in riflex sintef 2017 the locations where the minimum distance occurs are recorded as illustrated in fig 5 the blue and orange circles are the critical dynamic locations of the upstream and downstream risers respectively the static equilibrium deflection shapes are plotted in the same figure and the buoyancy modules are presented by the green lines it is found from the figure that there are three segments which have high risk of collision indicated as s 1 s 2 and s 3 more details for identification of critical segments can be found in fu et al 2017 4 comparison of different methods the assessment of the different methods for estimation of the extreme values will be done based on the data obtained from the 50 3 h simulations conducted in section 3 table 2 summarizes the first four moments of the random process x defined in eq 18 for different critical segments i e the mean standard deviation std skewness and kurtosis the coefficients of variations covs of these statistical moments are also shown in the same table the cov is defined as the ratio between the std and the mean value denoting the variation of estimation from each short term simulation generally the higher statistical moments present larger variations it should be noted that the skewness of x is negative indicating that the lower tail of the distribution x is longer from the table it also appears that the smallest mean value is found for s2 indicating a higher probability of collision at s2 it is also found that even though the segment s3 has the largest mean value it gives the largest std indicating a high risk of collision the statistics of the global maxima from the 50 3 h simulations i e x m are summarized in table 3 including the first four moments and the associated covs for different thresholds the mean value and std of the extreme value i e x e estimated from 50 3 h simulations are given in table 4 4 1 gpp and gev method the extreme values extracted from the 50 3 h simulations are assumed to be gev distributed the distribution parameters are determined by using the maximum likelihood estimates anderson and mathématicien 1958 in order to compare with the gumbel model the results for segments s 1 s 2 and s 3 obtained from the gev model are plotted in the gumbel probability paper in fig 6 the associated distribution parameters and the 3 h collision probabilities i e p f 3 h 1 f x e 3 h are summarized in table 5 from the results it is found that the fitted curves are nearly straight lines and the shape parameter γ is quite close to zero which is desired for practical application of the 2 parameter gumbel distribution instead of the 3 parameter gev distribution therefore in the following sections the gpp method will be used as a reference method for benchmarking the results of the other ones fig 7 presents the fitted gumbel distributions in the gumbel probability paper by applying the least square fitting method table 6 lists the associated distribution parameters and the calculated 3 h collision probabilities the results show that collision most likely occurs for s2 and the probability to have a collision at s1 is much lower 4 2 threshold and tail marker proposed method 1 pm1 as mentioned previously five different thresholds are investigated in this section i e x 0 μ x 0 0 5 1 1 2 1 4 s t d fig 8 presents an example of the selected global maxima with threshold x 0 μ x s t d which are identified from one 3 h time history sample fig 9 shows the estimated maxima and extreme distributions of one 3 h time history for different threshold values in terms of the probability of exceedance i e p f 3 h 1 f x e 3 h the estimated weibull distributions of the global maxima are illustrated in fig 9 a the estimated gumbel distributions of the extreme values are presented in fig 9 b the empirical extremes extracted from 50 3 h simulations are plotted in the same figure from fig 9 it appears that the choice of threshold has a significant effect on the statistics and the shape of the distribution the lower threshold values i e η 0 and η 0 5 s t d preserve the largest number of maxima from the time series however the distribution is heavily weighted to lower values and the fitted distribution does not agree well for the upper tail data as the threshold value increases i e η 1 2 s t d and η 1 4 s t d the weight of the upper tail data becomes important but the amount of data is reduced from the results it is found that η s t d captures most numbers of the extreme value data for the present study therefore the threshold η s t d will be adopted when the weibull tail fitting method pm1 is applied proposed method 2 pm2 for the translation process method based on cfd mapping of a combined parent distribution pm2 the tail marker is also important fig 10 a shows the translation functions of the pm2 with different tail markers i e η 0 0 5 1 0 1 2 1 4 s t d generally it is observed from the figure that for this highly skewed non gaussian processes the pm2 method can give a reliable estimation in the upper tail region the cdf mapping gives acceptable estimates as the upper tail behavior is well captured from fig 10 b it appears that there are more extremes to be captured as the tail marker increasing however the increase of η from η s t d to a higher value does not change the results significantly thus η s t d is considered to be adequate for extreme estimation acer regarding the acer methods the empirical acer functions ε ˆ k x for different orders of k are given in fig 11 a which are based on the data from the 50 3 h histories it appears that for the lower range of the individual maxima there is a noticeable variation of the empirical acer functions for different orders of k which implies a significant effect of dependence between the data points however the result is almost not affected by a further increase of k when k 2 in the upper range which means that there is no dependence effects that need to be accounted for thus k 2 is considered to be adequate for the estimation of extremes the advantage of the case with the second order empirical acer function is that the result is the most accurately estimated one because most data are available for its estimation the estimation of acer functions requires a better fitting of ε ˆ k x at higher thresholds and the estimation is not sensitive to the initial tail marker therefore the tail marker η σ is chosen which is consistent with the selection for the previous tail fitting method fig 11 b presents the empirical function ε ˆ 2 x and its 95 ci obtained from the time series as well as the estimated acer function in the upper tail region and the corresponding estimated 95 ci provided by the extrapolation scheme 4 3 comparison of different methods due to the statistical uncertainties which are inherent in the stochastic response process repeated simulations are required in order to obtain a reliable estimation when the methods pm1 and pm2 are applied the distribution of the extreme value is determined based on the averages of the expected value and the standard deviation for each simulation given by 19 e x e 1 n i 1 n e i x e s t d x e 1 n 1 i 1 n e i x e e x e 1 2 where n is the number of the time histories provided by the simulations and e i x e is the expected value for simulation number i as mentioned previously the purpose of this paper is to estimate the extreme value distribution by using limited data fig 12 illustrates the collision probability for the different methods at s2 versus the number of simulations n the threshold value for the acer the pm1 and the pm2 methods is chosen as η s t d according to the previous discussion generally it appears that the gpp and gev methods give slightly higher collision probabilities compared with the other methods due to the fact that the results are estimated by fitting to the largest maxima regarding the convergence it appears that the results obtained by applying the pm2 the acer and the gpp are almost not affected by a further increase of n when n 20 when the data is limited e g n 15 the accuracy of the gpp method is significantly influenced by the number of simulations while the pm2 and the acer methods are able to give an acceptable result when the data is limited finally the estimated extreme value distributions in terms of probability of exceedance for the three critical segments are shown in fig 13 the extracted 50 extreme samples are plotted in the same figure from the figure it also appears that all the methods are able to capture most of the largest maxima for all three segments for segment s1 it appears that the risk of collision is significantly lower and the extreme samples are not good enough to predict the collision events the collision probabilities for different methods are given in table 7 as expected both segments s2 and s3 give higher risk of collision due to the smallest mean value or the largest std of relative distance respectively fig 13 c shows that the collision probabilities obtained from pm1 and pm2 agree well with the results obtained from gpp and gev for the segment s3 which indicates the potential applicability of the proposed methods however fig 13 b illustrates that the methods pm1 and pm2 result in lower collision probabilities compared with the methods gpp and gev this is partly due to the dependence between the selected maxima compared with segment s3 the relative distance for segment s2 shows a stronger non gaussian behavior even when the global maxima are used the dependence between the maxima especially the small maxima decreases the weighting of the larger maxima leading to a lower collision probability unfortunately the acer method fails to give a satisfactory estimation because it is not able to capture the largest extreme values a possible reason is that the weighting of the smaller maxima is too high the results also emphasize the importance of the tail marker 5 conclusions this paper evaluated the performance of different methods for the short term extreme value analysis for the riser collision problem a pair of tandem arrangement risers in a steep wave configuration subjected to combined current and wave loads are modeled the blevins wake model is used to calculate the reduced drag force caused by the wake effect the minimum relative distance between the risers is computed at each time step the random process is obtained by changing the sign of the minimum distance in order to deal with the maxima extreme value problem the performance of the gumbel probability paper method the generalized extreme value method the average conditional exceedance rate method and the two proposed methods i e the gumbel method based on weibull tail fitting of maxima and the translation process method based on a combined parent distribution are evaluated the results show that the gumbel distribution is a good model for the estimation of the riser collision probability when a large number of simulations are available however the proposed method pm2 which is based on the cdf mapping of the combined distribution gave a satisfactory estimation when the amount of data is limited the proposed method 1 pm1 also resulted in a good prediction with limited data in the present study the potential weaknesses and strengths of the proposed methods are given however a wider range of collision scenarios need to be studied in order to further validate the methods it should be noted that the selection of an appropriate threshold value has a significant effect on the weibull tail fitting the performance of the acer method is somewhat unstable for the present study credit

expansibility paley et al 2008 peng et al 2017a dai et al 2018 xiang et al 2018 peng et al 2021b gao et al 2021 as one of the critical issues in multiple usvs system formation control has drawn increasing attention in scientific research do 2011 fu and yu 2018 liu et al 2020a c jiang et al 2021 to achieve expected formation behaviors a variety of schemes are developed such as virtual structure qin et al 2020b leader follower method peng et al 2013 cui et al 2010 shojaei 2015 jin 2016 dai et al 2020 liu et al 2020d graph based strategy peng et al 2014 liu et al 2017b li et al 2018 liu et al 2020b peng et al 2020a etc particularly graph based strategy is widely adopted due to its advantage of achieving formation pattern through distributed control structure there has been considerable attention drawn to the distributed formation control of usvs peng et al 2017a b liu et al 2017b li et al 2018 gu et al 2019a liu et al 2020b gao et al 2021 in peng et al 2017a a

approach and finite time stability theory in gu et al 2019a a distributed containment maneuvering controller is constructed for marine vessels regardless of the model uncertainties and the ocean disturbances in liu et al 2020b a ring networked coordination design is proposed for cooperative path following of under actuated usvs and a symmetric formation pattern can be achieved in gao et al 2021 a resource aware control method is designed to address the coordinated target tracking problem of multiple usvs with communication delays based on the distributed event triggered extended state observer although significant progress has been achieved on the distributed formation control of multiple usvs in the aforementioned works peng et al 2017a b liu et al 2017b li et al 2018 gu et al 2019a liu et al 2020b and gao et al 2021 the application of the above methods is still limited by the following restrictions first the physical constraints existing in usvs are not considered in peng et al 2017a b liu et al 2017b li et al 2018 gu et al 2019a liu et al 2020b and gao et al 2021 second the collision avoidance requirements are not taken into account during the formation control design of multiple usvs for multiple usvs the coupled inter vehicle safety requirement is a fundamental issue peng et al 2021b and the capability of collision avoidance is critical to the formation control of multiple usvs several prevailing collision avoidance schemes on the formation tracking control problem are proposed see the li et al 2021 ghommam et al 2020 huang et al 2020 gu et al 2021 peng et al 2019a 2020a park and yoo 2019 xu et al 2020 dai et al 2018 and he et al 2019 in li et al 2021 a repulsive potential function is incorporated into sliding manifold to achieve the distributed formation control with collision avoidance in ghommam et al 2020 a local path replanning based repulsive potential function technique is proposed to avoid collisions among usvs in huang et al 2020 an artificial potential field and a fast terminal sliding mode surface are used to design the safe formation tracking controller in gu et al 2021 peng et al 2019a and peng et al 2020a an artificial potential field is combined with the distributed guidance law to realize distributed path maneuvering of usvs with collision avoidance in park and yoo 2019 and xu et al 2020 a transformed formation error technique is utilized to achieve collision avoidance and distributed formation tracking in dai et al 2018 and he et al 2019 a prescribed performance technique is proposed for the formation control of multiple usvs with collision avoidance it is noted that the methods in dai et al 2018 he et al 2019 and peng et al 2020a are confined to fully actuated usvs rather than under actuated usvs however most of usvs belong to under actuated systems due to the lack of an independent lateral thruster in the sway dynamics in addition the aforementioned works gu et al 2021 peng et al 2019a 2020a dai et al 2018 he et al 2019 ignore the physical constraints of usvs in practice physical constraints are intrinsically existing in usvs due to the saturation of rudders and thrusters in zheng and feroskhan 2017 zheng et al 2018b amd qin et al 2020a and the limitation of the translational and rotational velocity in rout et al 2020 and li and yan 2017 the issue of simultaneously considering the physical constraints and inter vehicle collision avoidance in distributed formation tracking control of under actuated usvs has not been fully investigated to date especially in presence of model uncertainties and disturbances motivated by the above observations this paper addresses distributed formation tracking control with collision avoidance for a fleet of under actuated usvs subject to physical constraints and dynamical uncertainties an extended state observer based distributed model predictive formation control method is proposed specially the vehicle dynamics is firstly transformed into an almost spherical form composed of a position motion subsystem and an angular motion subsystem then an extended state observer eso is developed to estimate unknown nonlinear model uncertainties and external disturbances in each subsystem furthermore based on the recovered model information through the eso a distributed model predictive position controller and a model predictive angular controller are designed such that physical constraints and collision avoidance are guaranteed the formation control problem is formulated as a constrained quadratic programming qp problem which can be solved in a decentralized manner compared with the existing control methods of usvs the main contributions of the work are summarized as follows in contrast to the distributed formation control methods in chen and wei 2014 peng et al 2017a b c 2020a fu and yu 2018 qin et al 2019 and peng et al 2020b where control schemes are designed for fully actuated usvs this paper is dedicated to addressing the distributed formation control of under actuated usvs besides in contrast to do 2011 li et al 2018 gu et al 2019a liu et al 2020a b peng et al 2019a and li et al 2018 where the distributed formation control methods are designed for under actuated usvs without constraints this paper takes the physical constraints existing in usvs into account in contrast to the constrained control methods in zheng and feroskhan 2017 zheng et al 2018a b fu and yu 2018 liu et al 2020c and qin et al 2020a where input constraints of usvs are handled both the input saturation and state constraints are considered herein in addition in contrast to peng et al 2017b 2019b and fu and yu 2018 where inter vehicle safety requirements are not considered the proposed method can achieve formation pattern while avoiding collisions between vehicles in contrast to the mpc methods given in oh and sun 2010 yan and wang 2012 and li and yan 2017 where the tracking problem of a single marine vehicle is addressed this paper is dedicated to addressing the coordinated formation control of multiple under actuated usvs by using a distributed mpc method besides in contrast to the mpc methods in fahimi 2007 oh and sun 2010 yan and wang 2012 liu et al 2018 and wei et al 2021 where the precise models of usvs are available to design the proposed eso based distributed mpc strategy does not require the accurate models of usvs the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 gives the preliminaries and the problem formulation section 3 presents the proposed eso based distributed model predictive formation control design the main analysis and discussion of the simulation results are illustrated in section 4 and the conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 preliminaries

d i ν i ν i g ν i η i τ i w t which can be considered as lumped disturbance in body fixed reference frame including unmodeled hydrodynamics model uncertainties and external environmental disturbances according to do 2011 by using a coordinate transformation the vehicle dynamics in 3 can be transformed to an almost spherical form consisting of two subsystems as follows 4 p i q i q i f i q p i q i r

trajectory tracking control of usvs is shown in fig 1 in this paper the control objective is to steer a group of usvs to track a time varying reference trajectory produced by the virtual leader and maintain a desired formation pattern simultaneously while satisfying the physical constraints and the inter vehicle safety requirements 3 control design in this section an eso based distributed model predictive control strategy is developed for the group of usvs to fulfill trajectory tracking and formation synchronization task an eso is incorporated to estimate the lumped disturbances in the position motion subsystem and the angular motion subsystem base on the recovered model information an eso based distributed model predictive position tracking controller and a model predictive angular motion controller are designed such that the physical constraints and the collision avoidance requirements can be guaranteed the formation control with collision avoidance problem is formulated as an constrained qp problem the architecture of the proposed eso based distributed model predictive formation control strategy is shown in fig 2 3 1 eso design the prediction model of usvs is fundamental to the control design however the accurate model is difficult to acquire in practice even though the model can be identified with high accuracy offline it may suffer from the unknown internal

trajectory tracking of five usvs is considered without inter vehicle collision avoidance constraints fig 4 shows the formation trajectories of five usvs in which five usvs can track the reference trajectory with prescribed formation pattern however as shown in fig 7 the distance between usv 2 and usv 3 exceeds the collision distance during the formation configuration stage which leads to the collision between usv 2 and usv 3 then the collision avoidance constraints is considered in the formation trajectory tracking task and the simulation results are presented formation trajectories of five usvs are plotted in fig 5 it can be observed that five usvs can maintain a prescribed formation shape and track the preset reference trajectory meanwhile collision avoidance between usvs can be achieved during the formation configuration stage snap shots of five usvs and their trajectories at different time instant during the formation configuration stage are shown in fig 6 the collision avoidance performance is shown in fig 8 contrary to fig 7 the distances between usvs within the detection region are always larger than the collision distance which demonstrates that the inter vehicle collision avoidance can be realized from fig 11 during 0 100s five usvs try to realize formation configuration and collision avoidance in a cooperative fashion during 100 400s a static formation pattern is stabilized with small tracking errors fig 12 illustrates the estimation performance of the eso it implies that the lumped disturbance composed of the internal model uncertainties and the external disturbances in each control channel can be accurately estimated fig 10 shows the control inputs of the surge force and the yaw moment of each usv from which it can be seen that both the surge force and the yaw moment are smooth within the given constraints fig 13 shows that the surge velocity sway velocity and yaw velocity of each usv are bounded 4 2 formation control scenario guided

method is compared with the standard mpc method without eso under environmental disturbances to test the sensitivity of the prediction and control horizon to formation tracking control performance some sets of parameters are selected for simulation the simulation results are provided in figs 14 18 and table 1 where the results comparison between the proposed eso based distributed model predictive formation control method and the standard mpc method without eso are presented the discussion of the simulation results are presented as follows formation trajectories of five usvs by using the two methods are shown in fig 14 it is observed in fig 14 that five under actuated usvs can achieve formation trajectory tracking by using the two methods however the formation trajectories of the usvs of using the proposed method are more smooth than that of using the standard mpc method this indicates that the impacts of the disturbances can be eliminated by the proposed method and the proposed method in this paper can achieve more steady tracking performance than the standard mpc method without eso the estimation performance of the eso in this paper is depicted in fig 15 it is shown in fig 15 that the information of the lumped disturbances can be accurately estimated by the eso fig 16 depicts the detailed formation tracking errors of five usvs by using the two methods from which it can be seen that the proposed method in this paper achieves smaller tracking errors than by using the standard mpc method due to its disturbance estimation capability in real time the standard mpc method relies on the model of usvs and there exist tracking errors under the effect of the lump disturbances fig 17 shows the control inputs of five usvs by using the two methods it can be seen from fig 17 that both the proposed method and the standard mpc method satisfy the given constraints however the control inputs of the proposed method performs a smaller fluctuation than that of the standard mpc method without eso because it can accurately capture the lumped disturbance in real time the profiles of the surge sway and yaw velocities of five usvs by using the two methods are provided in fig 18 the formation control performance is influenced by the prediction and control horizon and the results under different parameter selections are summarized in table 1 from table 1 it can be found that if the prediction horizon is too small the short prediction range of future states leads to the failure of the inter vehicle collision avoidance it is also found in table 1 that increasing the prediction and control horizon in a range can improve the formation tracking accuracy however if the prediction horizon is too large the future state cannot be accurately predicted based on the current model information estimated by the eso which results in the degradation of the formation tracking performance 5 conclusion this paper consider the distributed formation tracking control problem of a group of under actuated usvs subject to constraints and uncertainties an eso based distributed model predictive formation control method is proposed to achieve formation tracking with inter vehicle collision avoidance at first the usv dynamics is transformed into an almost spherical form composed of a position motion subsystem and an angular motion subsystem then an eso is employed to estimate the model uncertainties and the external environmental disturbances in each subsystem based on the recovered model information through the eso a distributed eso based model predictive position controller and an eso based model predictive angular controller are designed to achieve formation tracking and inter vehicle collision avoidance the formation tracking problem is formulated as a constrained qp problem which can be locally solved in a decentralized manner the simulations of five under actuated usvs under different motion scenarios are carried out to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed eso based distributed model predictive formation control method the performance of the proposed method is compared with the standard mpc method without eso and the proposed method performs better with smaller tracking errors the simulation results show the efficacy of the proposed eso based distributed model predictive formation control method in this study some prior information on the control input gains of usvs is required in future works it is rewarding to investigate distributed mpc of usvs with fully unknown model based on machine learning in this paper the disturbance is assumed to be constant during the prediction horizon it is desirable to investigate the robust distributed model predictive formation control strategy

vehicles extended state observer model predictive control quadratic programming collision avoidance 1 introduction nowadays unmanned surface vehicles usvs can find various applications in both civil and military fields such as remote sensing ocean floor survey maritime search and rescue oil pipeline inspection sensor network and so on liu et al 2017a shi et al 2017 liu et al 2019a b peng et al 2021b qin et al 2020a rout et al 2020 liu et al 2020a peng et al 2021a compared with a single usv multiple usvs system shows the superiority in terms of additional flexibility robustness and expansibility paley et al 2008 peng et al 2017a dai et al 2018 xiang et al 2018 peng et al 2021b gao et al 2021 as one of the critical issues in multiple usvs system formation control has drawn increasing attention in scientific research do 2011 fu and yu 2018 liu et al 2020a c jiang et al 2021 to achieve expected formation behaviors a variety of schemes are developed such as virtual structure qin et al 2020b leader follower method peng et al 2013 cui et al 2010 shojaei 2015 jin 2016 dai et al 2020 liu et al 2020d graph based strategy peng et al 2014 liu et al 2017b li et al 2018 liu et al 2020b peng et al 2020a etc particularly graph based strategy is widely adopted due to its advantage of achieving formation pattern through distributed control structure there has been considerable attention drawn to the distributed formation control of usvs peng et al 2017a b liu et al 2017b li et al 2018 gu et al 2019a liu et al 2020b gao et al 2021 in peng et al 2017a a distributed containment control method is presented for usvs with multiple parameterized paths via spatial temporal decoupling in peng et al 2017b a neurodynamics based output feedback scheme is proposed for distributed containment maneuvering of usvs without using velocity measurements in liu et al 2017b a modular adaptive control method is developed for cooperative path maneuvering of usvs based on a line of sight guidance scheme and a path variable containment approach in li et al 2018 a distributed controller is designed for under actuated ships based on nonlinear sliding mode control approach and finite time stability theory in gu et al 2019a a distributed containment maneuvering controller is constructed for marine vessels regardless of the model uncertainties and the ocean disturbances in liu et al 2020b a ring networked coordination design is proposed for cooperative path following of under actuated usvs and a symmetric formation pattern can be achieved in gao et al 2021 a resource aware control method is designed to address the coordinated target tracking problem of multiple usvs with communication delays based on the distributed event triggered extended state observer although significant progress has been achieved on the distributed formation control of multiple usvs in the aforementioned works peng et al 2017a b liu et al 2017b li et al 2018 gu et al 2019a liu et al 2020b and gao et al 2021 the application of the above methods is still limited by the following restrictions first the physical constraints existing in usvs are not considered in peng et al 2017a b liu et al 2017b li et al 2018 gu et al 2019a liu et al 2020b and gao et al 2021 second the collision avoidance requirements are not taken into account during the formation control design of multiple usvs for multiple usvs the coupled inter vehicle safety requirement is a fundamental issue peng et al 2021b and the capability of collision avoidance is critical to the formation control of multiple usvs several prevailing collision avoidance schemes on the formation tracking control problem are proposed see the li et al 2021 ghommam et al 2020 huang et al 2020 gu et al 2021 peng et al 2019a 2020a park and yoo 2019 xu et al 2020 dai et al 2018 and he et al 2019 in li et al 2021 a repulsive potential function is incorporated into sliding manifold to achieve the distributed formation control with collision avoidance in ghommam et al 2020 a local path replanning based repulsive potential function technique is proposed to avoid collisions among usvs in huang et al 2020 an artificial potential field and a fast terminal sliding mode surface are used to design the safe formation tracking controller in gu et al 2021 peng et al 2019a and peng et al 2020a an artificial potential field is combined with the distributed guidance law to realize distributed path maneuvering of usvs with collision avoidance in park and yoo 2019 and xu et al 2020 a transformed formation error technique is utilized to achieve collision avoidance and distributed formation tracking in dai et al 2018 and he et al 2019 a prescribed performance technique is proposed for the formation control of multiple usvs with collision avoidance it is noted that the methods in dai et al 2018 he et al 2019 and peng et al 2020a are confined to fully actuated usvs rather than under actuated usvs however most of usvs belong to under actuated systems due to the lack of an independent lateral thruster in the sway dynamics in addition the aforementioned works gu et al 2021 peng et al 2019a 2020a dai et al 2018 he et al 2019 ignore the physical constraints of usvs in practice physical constraints are intrinsically existing in usvs due to the saturation of rudders and thrusters in zheng and feroskhan 2017 zheng et al 2018b amd qin et al 2020a and the limitation of the translational and rotational velocity in rout et al 2020 and li and yan 2017 the issue of simultaneously considering the physical constraints and inter vehicle collision avoidance in distributed formation tracking control of under actuated usvs has not been fully investigated to date especially in presence of model uncertainties and disturbances motivated by the above observations this paper addresses distributed formation tracking control with collision avoidance for a fleet of under actuated usvs subject to physical constraints and dynamical uncertainties an extended state observer based distributed model predictive formation control method is proposed specially the vehicle dynamics is firstly transformed into an almost spherical form composed of a position motion subsystem and an angular motion subsystem then an extended state observer eso is developed to estimate unknown nonlinear model uncertainties and external disturbances in each subsystem furthermore based on the recovered model information through the eso a distributed model predictive position controller and a model predictive angular controller are designed such that physical constraints and collision avoidance are guaranteed the formation control problem is formulated as a constrained quadratic programming qp problem which can be solved in a decentralized manner compared with the existing control methods of usvs the main contributions of the work are summarized as follows in contrast to the distributed formation control methods in chen and wei 2014 peng et al 2017a b c 2020a fu and yu 2018 qin et al 2019 and peng et al 2020b where control schemes are designed for fully actuated usvs this paper is dedicated to addressing the distributed formation control of under actuated usvs besides in contrast to do 2011 li et al 2018 gu et al 2019a liu et al 2020a b peng et al 2019a and li et al 2018 where the distributed formation control methods are designed for under actuated usvs without constraints this paper takes the physical constraints existing in usvs into account in contrast to the constrained control methods in zheng and feroskhan 2017 zheng et al 2018a b fu and yu 2018 liu et al 2020c and qin et al 2020a where input constraints of usvs are handled both the input saturation and state constraints are considered herein in addition in contrast to peng et al 2017b 2019b and fu and yu 2018 where inter vehicle safety requirements are not considered the proposed method can achieve formation pattern while avoiding collisions between vehicles in contrast to the mpc methods given in oh and sun 2010 yan and wang 2012 and li and yan 2017 where the tracking problem of a single marine vehicle is addressed this paper is dedicated to addressing the coordinated formation control of multiple under actuated usvs by using a distributed mpc method besides in contrast to the mpc methods in fahimi 2007 oh and sun 2010 yan and wang 2012 liu et al 2018 and wei et al 2021 where the precise models of usvs are available to design the proposed eso based distributed mpc strategy does not require the accurate models of usvs the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 gives the preliminaries and the problem formulation section 3 presents the proposed eso based

0 0 0 1 then the usv dynamics 1 can be rewritten in a compact form as follows 3 η i r i ψ i ν i ν i σ i m i 1 τ i where σ i σ i u σ i v σ i r t ℜ 3 is a state vector expressed as σ i m i 1 c i ν i ν i d i ν i ν i g ν i η i τ i w t which can be considered as lumped disturbance in body fixed reference frame including unmodeled hydrodynamics model uncertainties and external environmental disturbances according to do 2011 by using a coordinate transformation the vehicle dynamics in 3 can be transformed to an almost spherical form consisting of two subsystems as follows 4 p i q i q i f i q p i q i r

trajectory tracking control of usvs is shown in fig 1 in this paper the control objective is to steer a group of usvs to track a time varying reference trajectory produced by the virtual leader and maintain a desired formation pattern simultaneously while satisfying the physical constraints and the inter vehicle safety requirements 3 control design in this section an eso based distributed model predictive control strategy is developed for the group of usvs to fulfill trajectory tracking and formation synchronization task an eso is incorporated to estimate the lumped disturbances in the position motion subsystem and the angular motion subsystem base on the recovered model information an eso based distributed model predictive position tracking controller and a model predictive angular motion controller are designed such that the physical constraints and the collision avoidance requirements can be guaranteed the formation control with collision avoidance problem is formulated as an constrained qp problem the architecture of the proposed eso based distributed model predictive formation control strategy is shown in fig 2 3 1 eso design the prediction model of usvs is fundamental to the control design however the accurate model is difficult to acquire in practice even though the model can be identified with high accuracy offline it may suffer from the unknown internal perturbations and the time varying environmental disturbances as such an eso is incorporated to recover the prediction model and enhance the robustness of the controller herein an eso is developed to estimate the lumped disturbances f i q and f i r composed of the nonlinear model uncertainties and the external environmental disturbances in earth fixed inertial reference and it can be designed as

with n n dimension 3 2 position tracking controller design in this subsection based on the information of the eso and the neighbors the eso based model predictive controller of position motion subsystem is designed to accomplish position tracking subject to system constraints and lumped disturbances while guaranteeing collision avoidance some system constraints especially the nonconvex constraints such as system dynamic constraint and collision avoidance constraint are handled before formulating the optimization problems taking control objective into consideration the local cost function and optimization problem is then formulated and it is further reformulated as a constrained qp problem to obtain the optimal control input increment rewrite dynamics of the position motion

invariant during the short period of time k k n t satoh et al 2014 which reflects that only the current estimation information f ˆ i q k is available the assumption is assumed to be reasonable as a matter of fact only the first element of the computed optimal control input series is used and the future control input series is computed again at the next sampling time the position motion subsystem dynamics 9 can be discretized with the sampling period t as follows 10 x i q k t a i q x i q k b i q τ i q k c i q where a i q i 2 t i 2 0 2 2 i 2 ℜ 4 4 b i q 0 2 2 t m i u i 2 t ℜ 4 2 c i q 0 2 1 t f

using the proposed eso based distributed model predictive formation control method are illustrated in figs 4 13 the discussion of the simulation results is presented as follows firstly the formation trajectory tracking of five usvs is considered without inter vehicle collision avoidance constraints fig 4 shows the formation trajectories of five usvs in which five usvs can track the reference trajectory with prescribed formation pattern however as shown in fig 7 the distance between usv 2 and usv 3 exceeds the collision distance during the formation configuration stage which leads to the collision between usv 2 and usv 3 then the collision avoidance constraints is considered in the formation trajectory tracking task and the simulation results are presented formation trajectories of five usvs are plotted in fig 5 it can be observed that five usvs can maintain a prescribed formation shape and track the preset reference trajectory meanwhile collision avoidance between usvs can be achieved during the formation configuration stage snap shots of five usvs and their trajectories at different time instant during the formation configuration stage are shown in fig 6 the collision avoidance performance is shown in fig 8 contrary to fig 7 the distances between usvs within the detection region are always larger than the collision distance which demonstrates that the inter vehicle collision avoidance can be realized from fig 11 during 0 100s five usvs try to realize formation configuration and collision avoidance in a cooperative fashion during 100 400s a static formation pattern is stabilized with small tracking errors fig 12 illustrates the estimation performance of the eso it implies that the lumped disturbance composed of the internal model uncertainties and the external disturbances in each control channel can be accurately estimated fig 10 shows the control inputs of the surge force and the yaw moment of each usv from which it can be seen that both the surge force and the yaw moment are smooth within the given constraints fig 13 shows that the surge velocity sway velocity and yaw velocity of each usv are bounded 4 2 formation control scenario guided by curve trajectory in this subsection a new motion scenario is simulated to further illustrate the efficacy of the proposed eso based distributed model predictive formation control method the reference trajectory generated by the virtual leader usv 0 is selected as p 0 0 3 t 40 6 sin 0 02 t π 2 t and q 0 0 3 0 12 cos 0 02 t π 2 t according to fossen 2012 the time varying external environmental disturbances in this section are modeled as first order gauss markov processes with τ i w t γ i τ i w t ω i where γ i ℜ 3 3 and ω i ℜ 3 represent cutoff frequency and white noise respectively the prediction and control horizon in position tracking controller are chosen as n p 15 and n c 5 the prediction and control horizon in angular motion subsystem are chosen as n r p 5 and n r c 3 the initial states of five usvs are chosen as x 1 q 43 2 0 0 t x 2 q 52 15 0 0 t x 3 q 52 20 0 0 t x 4 q 55 5 0 0 t x 5 q 35 9 0 0 t the desired formation pattern is set as d 10 d 01 0 0 0 0 t d 21 d 12 0 8 0 0 t d 31 d 13 0 8 0 0 t d 53 d 35 0 8 0 0 t and d 42 d 24 0 8 0 0 t the weighting matrices are selected as s i 1 diag 1 5 1 5 s i 2 diag 1 1 q 10 diag 3 5 3 5 5 5 q 21 diag 5 5 8 8 q 31 diag 5 5 8 5 8 5 q 53 diag 5 5 8 8 q 42 diag 5 5 7 7 the bounds of δ τ i q τ i q τ i u δ τ i r τ i r are the same as the subsection 4 1 in order to further illustrate the efficacy the proposed method is compared with the standard mpc method without eso under environmental disturbances to test the sensitivity of the prediction and control horizon to formation tracking control performance some sets of parameters are selected for simulation the simulation results are provided in figs 14 18 and table 1 where the results comparison between the proposed eso based distributed model predictive formation control method and the standard mpc method without eso are presented the discussion of the simulation results are presented as follows formation trajectories of five usvs by using the two methods are shown in fig 14 it is observed in fig 14 that five under actuated usvs can achieve formation trajectory tracking by using the two methods however the formation trajectories of the usvs of using the proposed method are more smooth than that of using the standard mpc method this indicates that the impacts of the disturbances can be eliminated by the proposed method and the proposed method in this paper can achieve more steady tracking performance than the standard mpc method without eso the estimation performance of the eso in this paper is depicted in fig 15 it is shown in fig 15 that the information of the lumped disturbances can be accurately estimated by the eso fig 16 depicts the detailed formation tracking errors of five usvs by using the two methods from which it can be seen that the proposed method in this paper achieves smaller tracking errors than by using the standard mpc method due to its disturbance estimation capability in real time the standard mpc method relies on the model of usvs and there exist tracking errors under the effect of the lump disturbances fig 17 shows the control inputs of five usvs by using the two methods it can be seen from fig 17 that both the proposed method and the standard mpc method satisfy the given constraints however the control inputs of the proposed method performs a smaller fluctuation than that of the standard mpc method without eso because it can accurately capture the lumped disturbance in real time the profiles of the surge sway and yaw velocities of five usvs by using the two methods are provided in fig 18 the formation control performance is influenced by the prediction and control horizon and the results under different parameter selections are summarized in table 1 from table 1 it can be found that if the prediction horizon is too small the short prediction range of future states leads to the failure of the inter vehicle collision avoidance it is also found in table 1 that increasing the prediction and control horizon in a range can improve the formation tracking accuracy however if the prediction horizon is too large the future state cannot be accurately predicted based on the current model information estimated by the eso which results in the degradation of the formation tracking performance 5 conclusion this paper consider the distributed formation tracking control problem of a group of under actuated usvs subject to constraints and uncertainties an eso based distributed model predictive formation control method is proposed to achieve formation tracking with inter vehicle collision avoidance at first the usv dynamics is transformed into an almost spherical form composed of a position motion subsystem and an angular motion subsystem then an eso is employed to estimate the model uncertainties and the external environmental disturbances in each subsystem based on the recovered model information through the eso a distributed eso based model predictive position controller and an eso based model predictive angular controller are designed to achieve formation tracking and inter vehicle collision avoidance the formation tracking problem is formulated as a constrained qp problem which can be locally solved in a decentralized manner the simulations of five under actuated usvs under different motion scenarios are carried out to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed eso based distributed model predictive formation control method the performance of the proposed method is compared with the standard mpc method without eso and the proposed method performs better with smaller tracking errors the simulation results show the efficacy of the proposed eso based distributed model predictive formation control method in this study some prior information on the control input gains of usvs is required in future works it is rewarding to investigate distributed mpc of usvs with fully unknown model based on machine learning in this paper the disturbance is assumed to be constant during the prediction horizon it is desirable to investigate the robust distributed model predictive formation control strategy considering change rate of the disturbance the presented work does not consider the convention on the international regulations for preventing collisions colregs in future works it is necessary to include the colregs into the distributed formation control law design credit authorship contribution statement guanghao lv algorithm research simulation study writing original draft writing review
