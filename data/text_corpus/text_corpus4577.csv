22885,at present most hull form optimisation methods adopt some optimisation algorithms to search the design space to obtain an optimal solution these optimisation methods ignore the implicit relationship between optimisation variables and objective functions which often leads to low efficiency and difficulty in obtaining a global optimal solution if we can learn in advance the relevant design knowledge of a design space we can effectively determine the ship form optimisation and save time this paper proposes a knowledge extraction method based on two data mining techniques partial correlation analysis and self organising map som by considering numerical functions and dtmb5415 as the research objectives knowledge extraction is performed by combining the partial correlation analysis and som based on optimisation data through a comparative analysis of results the effectiveness of the data mining technology is verified and the obtained knowledge plays an important role in directing the ship form optimisation keywords data mining hull form optimisation design knowledge 1 introduction along with computational fluid dynamics cfd and rapid development in computer technology ship optimisation technology based on cfd has continuously developed in the optimisation of a ship form a large amount of optimisation data is needed to obtain the ideal optimisation objectives peri and campana 2005 kim and yang 2010 because of the complex interaction between the optimisation objectives and design variables implicit information on the data cannot be intuitively provided research on hull form optimisation only provides the optimal simulation results for data optimisation thus the design knowledge of the optimisation data are ignored to solve these problems data mining technology is introduced into the optimisation research from large incomplete noisy fuzzy and stochastic optimisation data rules and visual forms to extract the hidden design knowledge are used for guidance and understanding the ship optimisation problem in recent years data mining has attracted much attention as an effective data analysis tool for simulation for example wang et al 2004 mapped the optimisation performance space using the rough set theory and located noteworthy multiple subspaces by screening the excellent subspace of the performance objectives a large reduction in the design space was realised santana quintero et al 2010 used the rough set theory to identify better performance of a space used as a guide for optimisation of the genetic algorithm direction which greatly improved the efficiency of the optimisation algorithm diez et al 2014 and chen et al 2015 used the karhunen loeve expansion to evaluate the hull eliminate the factors with less influence and realised dimensionality reduction using few design variable modelling jeong et al 2005 obayashi et al 2007 and jeong and kim 2013 applied data mining technology for profile optimisation of an impeller and used the rough set theory and decision tree to extract the airfoil design rules to improve each objective viswanath et al 2010 mapped high dimensional data to a low dimensional hidden space using topology mapping optimised the hidden space in a low dimensional hidden space to identify the greatest advantages and sampled the high dimensional design space that corresponded to the greatest advantages of a low dimensional hidden space to obtain a new sample set and complete the space reduction zahir and gao 2012 proposed a space reduction method based on a low precision approximation model this method optimised the whole optimisation space using the low precision approximation model then analysed its search trajectory and determined the reduced space that was worthy of attention according to the problem of low optimisation efficiency in an aerodynamic configuration optimisation design of aircraft wu et al 2016 used the partial correlation analysis results to reduce the range of relevant design variables and reconstructed the optimal design space to extract the design knowledge between the hull design variables and objectives the current thesis optimises the wave drag of dtmb5415 using multiple froude numbers fr and then uses partial correlation analysis and a self organising map som to extract the design knowledge of the wave drag optimisation data this paper is divided into four parts the first part introduces the data mining technology the second part verifies the feasibility of the data mining technology design knowledge extraction using a mathematical function example the third part is based on the dtmb5415 hull form optimisation data and uses the data mining technology to carry out the design knowledge of the objective function and design variables the fourth part summaries the research contents 2 data mining technology in this study two data mining techniques are used to extract the design rules partial correlation analysis and som the partial correlation analysis can determine the relationship between the variables and objectives som can cluster the sample data project the high dimensional data with similar features to an adjacent area of a low dimensional space and directly analyse the data features 2 1 partial correlation analysis in statistics the process of describing the degree of linear correlation between the variables and expression of appropriate statistical indicators is called correlation analysis different correlation analysis methods can be used depending on the purpose of the study or the type of variables the commonly used correlation analysis theories are the following binary fixed length variable correlation analysis binary ordered variable correlation analysis and partial correlation analysis the partial correlation analysis needs to control the linear effect of other variables during analysis of the correlation mastering the data of multiple variables while calculating the partial correlation coefficient is necessary on the one hand the possible effects on the variables are considered on the other hand certain methods are used to control the other variables and to study the close degree of correlation between two variables to obtain a more accurate analysis to obtain more accurate and reliable mining information the partial correlation coefficient is selected to determine the linear correlation between the variables and objectives he 2007 the partial correlation coefficient is calculated using a correlation coefficient symmetric matrix which is composed of simple coefficients the simple correlation coefficient r ij of variables x i and x j can be expressed as 1 r i j x i x i x j x j x i x i 2 x j x j 2 the correlation coefficient symmetric matrix r is expressed as follows 2 r r 11 r 12 r 1 n r 21 r 22 r 2 n r n 1 r n 2 r n n the partial correlation coefficient r ij of variables x i and x j can be expressed as 3 r i j δ i j δ i i δ i i δ i j δ i i δ j j are algebraic cofactors corresponding to elements r ij r ii and r jj in the s correlation coefficient symmetric matrix from the above mentioned theory the correlation coefficient between the variables and objectives can be obtained by choosing appropriate data a positive or negative sign indicates a positive or negative correlation between the variable and object the coefficient size represents the linear correlation between the design variables and objectives if the absolute value of the coefficient is more than 0 4 we consider that a strong linear relationship exists between the variable and object otherwise a weaker linear relationship exists 2 2 som theory self organising map som neural network nn was first proposed by kohonen kohonen 1982 1988 1989 an unsupervised nn is used to cluster sample data sets into groups and high dimensional data with similar characteristics are then projected onto an adjacent area in a low dimensional space in this manner the data characteristics can be easily and intuitively analysed soms have been widely used in sample classification data visualisation spatial reduction and other related areas somnn has several noteworthy characteristics the network can adaptively change the parameters and structure within the network and can learn without supervision or any prior knowledge i e it is self organising nn contains a number of neurons and through the learning process the statistical features of the input are represented in various neuron connection weights if for some reason such as noise or hardware failure a neuron is damaged or fails the remaining neurons can retain the information to ensure that nn continues to function i e it is fault tolerant by adjusting the weights in the network through the training process the neurons in the network output layer are tuned to a specific input pattern therefore the neurons can generalise without requiring a large number of training samples somnn can project the high dimensional data onto the output layers of a two dimensional map the internal links among the data can be inspected thus the relationships are easily visualised owing to these characteristics somnn is useful for processing high dimensional data the design space can be selected for preliminary investigation using an appropriate number of samples the relationship between the design variables and design goals can be more readily analysed and the design space can be reduced 2 2 1 som neural network structure somnn contains two layers input and output layers the competitive layer as shown in fig 1 the input layer receives sample input vector x x1 x2 x n the number of neurons is equal to the sample dimension in the output layer each neuron is randomly assigned weight vector w w1 w2 w n the neurons compete with one another the weight vectors of the superior neurons and their adjacent neurons are iteratively updated the sample data are mapped into neurons with hexagonal meshes 2 3 introduction to som learning algorithms the som network uses an unsupervised learning algorithm when each sample is applied to the input layer the neurons in the output layer compete with one another based on distance measurement the weight vectors of the winning neuron and the adjacent neurons are adjusted after a sufficient number of training samples the distribution of the weight vectors becomes similar to the probability density distribution of the input samples i e the weight vector is closer to the input vector sample data with similar characteristics can be mapped onto the neurons adjacent to the output layer the specific steps of the som learning algorithm are described as follows 1 initialization a weight vector unit vector is randomly assigned for each neuron the output layer to obtain w w 1 w 2 w n where n is the dimension of the sample data at the input layer determine the initial winning area radius 0 and the initial learning rate η 0 0 η 0 1 2 input vector normalisation the input vector is composed of the values of the design variables and objective functions normalisation process is conducted to obtain vector x x 1 x 2 x n 3 similarity measurement euclidean distance d x i w j j 1 2 m is calculated where m is the number of neurons in the output layer between the input sample i and all neurons in the output layer neuron c with the shortest distance is determined to identify the winning neuron 4 weight vector adjustment the weights of the winning neuron c and the neurons in the adjacent areas are adjusted as follows 4 w t 1 w t η t h t x i w t in eq 4 η t and h t are the learning rate and the neighborhood function respectively both these functions decrease as time increases neighborhood function h t is a gaussian function 5 h t exp d c f 2 r 2 t where d cf is the distance between the winning neuron c and neuron f within the winning neighborhood and r is the radius of the winning field the radius r t and the learning rate η t both decrease as the number of training iterations t increases 6 r t 1 i n t r t 1 1 t t 1 7 η t 1 η t η 0 t 5 process repetition the next training sample is applied to the input layer and the process returns to step 2 until training count t is equal to chosen limit t by training using a sufficient number of samples the spatial distribution of the weight vectors of the neurons in the competition layer approximates the spatial probability distribution of the input pattern by inspecting the two dimensional map the relationships between the design goals and design variables can be analysed these relationships provide the basis for the design space reduction 3 numerical example the partial correlation analysis and som can both extract the trend of the variables and objectives the calculated partial correlation coefficient is clear and no error occurs from artificial judgment however the partial correlation analysis cannot fully analyse the relationship between each variable and the object in a weak liner function the computation of som is rather complicated and the generated map needs to be artificially determined however the related problems in nonlinear problems can be analysed and the distribution range of the variables can be provided therefore this study combines the two data mining technologies first partial correlation analysis is used for data mining if most of the variables and objective functions cannot be analysed then som can be used for data mining fig 2 shows the overall procedure the knowledge extraction framework in this study 3 1 design knowledge extraction of strong linear relation function different dimensional functions are used to verify the ability of the partial correlation analysis and som to analyse the relationship between the variables and objectives in a low dimension the two dimensional sum of squares function is used to test the methodology the two dimensional sum of squares function is defined as follows 8 f 2 s u m x y x 2 y 2 x y 0 1 the solution and minimum value are min f 2 s u m 0 0 0 the particle swarm optimisation pso algorithm is used to optimise the function the number of swarm particles is set to 50 the number of iterations is set to 10 for the optimised data the above mentioned data mining technologies are used to extract the design knowledge the partial correlation coefficients of the function variables and objects are listed in table 1 the partial correlation coefficients are 0 85 and 0 77 the linear relationship between the variables and object is positively correlated which means that the smaller the values of x and y in the optimisation space are the smaller is the object fig 3 shows the som variables and object identified by colours the solutions at the upper side have preferable f 2 s u m x y 0 the solutions at the upper part have relatively small values of x and y in high dimension six dimensional sum squares function is used to test the methodology the six dimensional sum squares function is defined as follows 9 f 6 s u m x i 6 x i 2 x i 0 3 the solution and minimum value are min f 6 s u m x f 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 the pso algorithm is used to optimise the function the number of swarm particles is set to 50 the number of iterations is set to 10 the partial correlation coefficients of the function variables and object are listed in table 2 the partial correlation coefficient between all variables and the object is greater than 0 4 a strong positive correlation exists between the variables and object fig 4 shows the som of the variables and object identified by colours the solutions at the upper side have preferable f 6 s u m x the solutions at the upper part have a relatively small value of x i the extracted design knowledge is consistent with that extracted by the partial correlation analysis the above example shows that the two methods can accurately extract the information contained in the function the data mining results of the partial correlation analysis and som in the strong linear relationship function are consistent they can be used as a design knowledge extraction tool 3 2 design knowledge extraction of a weak linear relationship function in a low dimension the mccormick function is applied to verify the ability of the partial correlation analysis and som to extract the design knowledge from weak linear relationships the function is expressed as 10 f m c c o r m i c k x y sin x y x y 2 1 5 x 2 5 y 1 where x 1 5 4 and y 3 4 the solution and minimum value are min f mccormick 0 54719 1 54718 1 933 the pso algorithm is used to optimise the function the number of swarm particles is set to 50 the number of iterations is set to 10 as listed in table 3 the partial correlation coefficient of x and the object is 0 64 a strong positively correlated linear relationship exists which means that x takes small values in optimisation space 1 5 4 which is conducive for obtaining an optimal solution however the coefficient between y and the object is 0 18 which cannot be quantitatively analysed fig 5 shows the som of the variables and object identified by colours the solutions at the upper part have preferable f m c c o r m i c k x y the range of values corresponding to the x and y map on the upper part are 1 26 0 17 and 2 58 0 74 therefore assigning a small value of variables x and y in optimisation spaces 1 5 4 and 3 4 is good for the function to obtain the optimal solution the result of the x analysis using som is consistent with that using the partial correlation analysis in a high dimension the six dimensional hartman function is used to verify the ability of the partial correlation analysis and som to extract the design knowledge from weak linear relationships the six dimensional hartman function is defined as follows 11 f h a r t m a n x i 1 4 c i exp j 1 6 a i j x j p i j 2 0 x j 1 where a i j 10 3 17 3 5 1 7 8 0 05 10 17 0 1 8 14 3 3 5 1 7 10 17 8 17 8 0 05 10 0 1 14 p i j 0 1312 0 1696 0 5569 0 0124 0 8283 0 5886 0 2329 0 4135 0 8307 0 3736 0 1004 0 9991 0 2348 0 1415 0 3522 0 3522 0 3047 0 6650 0 4047 0 8828 0 8732 0 5743 0 1091 0 0381 the solution and minimum value are min f hartman 0 201 0 15 0 477 0 275 0 311 0 657 3 322 the pso algorithm is used to optimise the function the number of swarm particles is set to 60 the number of iterations is set to 20 the partial correlation coefficients of the function variables and object are listed in table 4 small x 1 x 2 and x 5 values and a large x 6 value are necessary conditions for the hartman function however the coefficients between variables x 3 and x 4 and the object are too small to be quantitatively analysed fig 6 shows the som of the variables and object identified by colours the solutions at the upper part have preferable f hartman x as shown in fig 6 a the ranges of values corresponding to variables x 3 and x 4 in the map shown in fig 6 a are 0 46 0 53 and 0 24 0 35 therefore an intermediate x 3 value and a small x 4 value in optimisation space 0 1 are necessary conditions for the hartman function other som variables x 1 x 2 x 5 and x 6 are shown in fig 6 b we can learn that the design knowledge extracted by som is the same as that extracted by the partial correlation analysis thus we can obtain the following summary from the combination of the above examples the partial correlation coefficients can be easily obtained and no artificial judgment is required however the partial correlation analysis cannot fully analyse the relationship between each variable and the object in a weak liner function soms can be used for both linear and nonlinear problems and the range of variables can be quantitatively obtained 3 3 design knowledge extraction of multi objective function due to the defect of partial correlation analysis in nonlinearity and the nonlinear relationship in the function example can be clearly known only som is used for data mining in multi objective examples of functions in a low dimension the mccormick and schaffer functions are used to test the methodology the functions are defined as follows 12 f m c x y sin x y x y 2 1 5 x 2 5 y 1 f s c x y 0 5 sin 2 x 2 y 2 0 5 1 0 001 x 2 y 2 2 where x 1 5 4 and y 3 4 the solution and minimum value are min f m c 0 54719 1 54718 1 933 f s c 0 0 0 the multi objective pso mopso algorithm is used to optimise the function the number of swarm particles is set to 60 the number of iterations is set to 20 fig 7 shows the non dominated solutions obtained after mopso we can confirm that f mc and f sc exhibit a strong trade off relationship the som method is used to map and analyse the optimisation data to obtain the som map shown in fig 8 the maps show that the optimal value f x of the mccormick function is located near the lower part of the map as shown in the red box the optimal value f x of the schaffer function is located near the upper left part as shown in the black box in the red box we can see that the range of x can be reduced to 1 13 0 40 and y can be reduced to 2 29 0 74 thus small x and y value in optimisation space 1 5 4 and 3 4 are necessary conditions for the mccormick function in the black box we can see that the range of x can be reduced to 0 11 0 92 and y can be reduced to 0 72 0 32 thus a small x value and intermediate y value in optimisation spaces 1 5 4 and 3 4 are necessary conditions for the schaffer function the above mentioned design knowledge is consistent with the actual value of the optimal solution of the functions in a high dimension the six dimensional sum of squares function namely eq 9 and the six dimensional hartman function eq 11 are used to test the methodology the mopso algorithm is used to optimise the function the number of swarm particles is set to 60 the number of iterations is set to 20 where x i 0 1 i 1 2 6 the solution and minimum value are min f 6 s u m 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 f h a r t m a n 0 201 0 15 0 15 0 477 0 275 0 311 0 657 3 322 fig 9 shows the non dominated solutions obtained after mopso we can confirm that f 6sum and f hartman show a strong trade off relationship the som method is used to map and analyse the optimisation data to obtain the som shown in fig 10 optimal value f x of the six dimensional sum of squares function is located near the upper right part of the map as shown in the red box in the red box the range of x 1 x 6 can be reduced to 0 0 25 therefore small values of x 1 x 6 are necessary conditions for the six dimensional sum of squares function the maps show that optimal value f x of the hartman function is located near the upper left part of the map as shown in the black box in the black box we can see that the range of x 1 x 2 x 4 and x 5 can be reduced to 0 0 25 the range of x 3 can be reduced to 0 222 0 547 and the range of x 6 can be reduced to 0 547 0 708 therefore small values of x 1 x 2 x 4 and x 5 an intermediate value of x 3 and a large value of x 6 in optimisation space 0 1 are necessary conditions for the six dimensional hartman function the extraction design rules are the same as that presented in sections 2 1 and 2 2 by extracting the design knowledge from the single object and multi objective optimisations we obtain the following summary 1 in the strong linear function the partial correlation analysis and som can both accurately extract the same design knowledge 2 the partial correlation coefficients can be easily obtained and no artificial judgment is required however the partial correlation analysis cannot fully analyse the relationship between each variable and the object in a weak liner function 3 soms are applicable for both linear and nonlinear problems and the range of variables can be quantitatively obtained however the operation is more complicated and requires artificial judgment in the colour patch analysis in the subsequent research of engineering optimisation the linear nonlinear relationship between variables and targets cannot be judged in advance therefore we combine the two data mining techniques to extract the design knowledge first the partial correlation analysis is used for data mining if most of the variables and objective functions cannot be analysed som is used for data mining 4 data mining of dtmb5415 dtmb 5415 has a very well designed cone shaped sonar dome a transom stern and a slender hull body the main elements are listed in table 5 4 1 design knowledge extraction framework fig 11 shows the overall procedure of the design knowledge extraction framework in this study it consists of shape optimisation and design knowledge extraction in the shape optimisation the design space is explored using the mopso algorithm we use the radial basis function rbf interpolation method to realise the deformation of the ship hull surface the shipflow software is used as cfd solver in the design knowledge extraction we employ the design knowledge extraction method described in section 2 to realise the design knowledge extraction 4 2 shape optimisation of dtmb5415 4 2 1 description of the optimisation problem 1 optimisation objectives the present study is focused on the wave drag performance of hull form over a wide speed range therefore the objective functions of the optimisation are defined as follows f o b j 1 min c w 1 f r 1 0 22 f o b j 2 min c w 2 f r 2 0 28 f o b j 3 min c w 3 f r 3 0 41 where fr is froude number c w i denotes the wave drag coefficient of the hull form obtained during the optimisation process 2 optimisation variables eleven variable points are selected as shown in fig 12 where variable point x 3 changes along the x direction to control the length parameter of a sonar dome variable points y 1 y 2 and y 4 y 11 change along the y direction where variable points y 6 and y 9 control the width parameter of the sonar dome variable points y 1 y 5 y 7 and y 10 are arranged along the waterline to control the size of the inflow angle and shape of the inflow section on the waterline and y 2 y 4 y 8 and y 11 can have a great effect on the bilge line table 6 3 optimisation constraints 1 displacement constraint o p t 0 2 only the fore bodies can be modified and the length l breadth b draft t and stern lines are not changed the fixed points as shown in fig 13 4 2 2 hull surface modification method based on rbf interpolation we briefly introduce rbf for automatic modification kim et al 2008 2010 rbf is a type of real valued function that is symmetric along the radial direction whose value depends only on the euclidean distance between any point x and the centre of point x i buhmann 2004 the basis function is expressed as follows 13 φ x x i i 1 2 n where x i is the centre of rbf and φ is the rbf of the variable euclidean distance when rbf interpolation is used during hull form modification the function is defined as follows morris et al 2010 14 s x i 1 n λ i φ x x i p x where s x represents the displacement of point x x y z on the hull surface p x which is a low order polynomial is used to recover the translation and rotation and has the specific form p x c 1 x c 2 y c 3 z c 4 n is the number of control points and x x i is the euclidean distance between two points here the three dimensional wendland function with a compact support feature is adopted as the basis function 15 φ x 1 x 4 4 x 1 0 x 1 0 x 1 equation 15 guarantees that the constructed system matrix is a positive definite matrix equation coefficients λ i and c i are obtained by changing the control point coordinates morse et al 2001 16 s x i f i i 1 2 n where f i is the displacement of the control point additional requirements include the following 22 17 k 1 n λ k x k t 0 k 1 n λ k 0 the values of coefficients λ i and c i are obtained by solving the linear system 18 f 0 m q q t 0 λ c where λ λ 1 λ 2 λ n t c c 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 t f f 1 f 2 f n t m i j φ x i x j i j 1 2 n 19 q x 1 y 1 z 1 1 x 2 y 2 z 2 1 x n y n z n 1 all unknown coefficients in eq 14 can be obtained by solving eq 19 then the new coordinates for all unknown points can be obtained through rbf interpolation 4 2 3 mopso the optimisation problem is solved by mopso whose iteration is expressed as coello et al 2002 2004 20 v j i w v j i 1 c 1 r 1 p b e s t j p j i 1 c 2 r 2 g b e s t p j i 1 21 p j i p j i 1 v j i where p j i is the position of the jth swarm particle at the ith iteration pbest j is the best position ever visited by the jth particle personal optimum gbest is the position of the best overall optimum ever visited by all particles global optimum and v j is the particle speed coefficients w c 1 and c 2 are used to control the inertia and personal social behaviour of the swarm here w 0 8 and c 1 c 2 2 the number of swarm particles is set to 60 the number of iterations is set to 20 the multi objective procedures including the meta heuristics provide two main properties the first one must generate high quality non dominated solutions on the pareto front of the modm multi objective decision making problem the second one concerns a proper diversity for the generated solutions on the pareto front of the modm problem the simplicity and success of the simple pso among the other meta heuristic procedures result in the development of its multi objective variants the developed procedures in this part are roughly categorised into five main classes namely aggregating lexicographic sub population pareto based and combination of classes reyes sierra and coello coello 2006 4 2 4 validation of cfd the validation study for shipflow software is carried out before the optimisation shipflow is the flow solver for the potential flow around three dimensional bodies based on a surface singularity panel method for dtmb 5415 model the comparisons between experimental data and wave drag c w given by shipflow software and ittc formula c f are shown in fig 14 it can be seen from fig 14 that the drag coefficient predicted by shipflow software and ittc formula are in consistent agreement with the experimental measurements this demonstrates that the cfd calculation accuracy is guaranteed and it can be applied to the automatic optimisation of the hull form 4 2 5 optimisation result analysis fig 15 shows the non dominated solutions obtained after the multi objective shape optimisation we can confirm that cw 1 cw 3 and cw 2 cw 3 display a trade off relationship whereas cw 1 cw 2 displays a linear relationship this result implies that the performance in terms of the wave drag at low fr 0 22 and intermediate fr 0 28 design speeds is opposite to that at a high design speed fr 0 41 and the performance in terms of the wave drag at a low design speed is consistent with that at the intermediate design speed three typical optimum solutions cases 1 3 are selected among the non dominated solution employed to investigate the wave drag performance under different speed ranges as shown in fig 15 case 1 is a solution with low wave drag performance at a low design speed case 3 is a solution with low wave drag performance at a high design speed case 2 is compromise solution between cases 1 and 3 table 7 lists the values of the variables table 8 lists the variations in the geometric properties and percentages of the wave drag coefficients from those in the baseline configuration fig 16 shows the comparison of the wave drags r w between the initial and that of each of these three cases case 1 exhibits the best wave drag performance in the low speed range whereas case 3 exhibits the best wave drag performance in the high speed range as expected case 2 shows intermediate wave drag performance at all speed ranges the best wave drag performance in the high speed range 4 3 design knowledge extraction 4 3 1 partial correlation analysis partial correlation analysis is applied to data mining of the dtmb5415 optimised data the partial correlation coefficient among 11 design variables y 1 y 2 x 3 and y 4 y 11 and objectives f o b j 1 f o b j 2 and f o b j 3 are calculated using eqs 1 3 and the results are listed in table 9 according to the results y 1 x 3 y 7 and y 8 have a strong positive correlation with f o b j 1 y 2 has a strong negative correlation with f o b j 1 x 3 y 8 and y 10 have a strong positive correlation with f o b j 2 x 3 has a strong positive correlation with f o b j 3 f o b j 1 f o b j 2 and f o b j 3 are the drag performance at low intermediate and high speed we confirm that x 3 has a positive correlation with the wave drag coefficient at different speeds a longer sonar dome is beneficial to the wave drag coefficient under different fr s fig 17 shows the comparison of the body plans buttock lines and waterlines of the initial hull form with those in case 1 low speed hull form the arrow in fig 14 shows the trend of the optimisation variables compared with the initial hull form case 1 has a slightly wider section shape at the lower part near y 2 and a narrower waterline in the bow part near y 1 and y 7 the sonar dome length near x 3 is moderately elongated and the waterline of the bow is concave according to the general knowledge on ship design the waterline is thin and the inlet angle is small which are beneficial for reducing wave drag the concave waterline helps reduce the pressure along the ship forward direction of the bow thereby reducing drag at different speeds good wave drag performance is realised when the size and position of the bulbous bow are properly chosen therefore the design knowledge extracted by the partial correlation analysis satisfies the general knowledge about ship design at high speed the linear correlation between variables and targets is poor thus the design knowledge under high speed needs to be analysed using som 4 3 2 som at high speed som is applied to data mining of the dtmb5415 optimised data colours representing the output layer can be used to analyse the relationship between the wave drag coefficient and optimisation variables fig 18 shows that smaller f o b j 3 is distributed in the upper right portion of the map by observing the map of the design variables corresponding to the upper right neurons the colour patches of y 1 x 3 y 5 and y 10 in the area are blue whereas the colour patches of y 4 and y 11 in the area are red we can confirm that smaller values of y 1 x 3 y 5 and y 10 and larger values of y 4 and y 11 are beneficial in reducing the wave drag coefficient at high speed fig 19 shows the comparison of the body plans buttock lines and waterlines of the initial hull form with those in case 3 high speed hull form compared with the initial hull form case 3 has a slightly wider section shape at the lower part y 4 and y 11 and narrower waterlines in the bow part near y 1 y 5 and y 10 the body plan of the bow is deformed from v to u the sonar dome length near x 3 is moderately elongated and longer than that in case 1 the waterline is slightly thin and appears similar to a straight line according to the general knowledge on ship design at high speed the u shape body plans of the bow can reduce wave drag at high speed because more displacement is distributed below the waterline simultaneously an extreme u shape should be avoided to increase the bilge vortex the sonar dome length is longer than that at low speed because wavelengths increase with the speed of a ship when the ship speed increases the wave expands backward and the high pressure area expands thus the waterline must be thin and should be straight at high speed therefore the design knowledge extracted by som satisfies the general knowledge about ship design at high speed to verify the results of the partial correlation analysis the som method is used to map the data of f o b j 1 and f o b j 2 fig 20 shows that smaller f o b j 1 and f o b j 2 are distributed in the upper middle portion of the map by observing the map of the design variables corresponding to the upper middle neurons the colour patches of y 1 x 3 y 7 and y 8 are blue whereas the colour patch of y 2 is yellow we can confirm that smaller values of y 1 x 3 y 7 and y 8 and a larger value of y 2 are beneficial for reducing the wave drag coefficient at low speed the design knowledge extracted by som is consistent with that extracted by the partial correlation analysis thus the design knowledge obtained through the present data mining can be summarised as follows 1 case 1 low speed hull form has a slightly wider section shape at the lower part near y 2 and a narrower waterline in the bow part near y 1 and y 7 the bulbous length near x 3 is moderately elongated and the waterline of the bow is concave 2 case 3 high speed hull form has a slightly wider section shape at the lower part y 4 and y 11 and a narrower waterline in the bow part near y 1 y 5 and y 10 the body plans of the bow is deformed from v to u the bulbous length near x 3 is moderately elongated and longer than that in case 1 the waterline is slightly thin and appears similar to a straight line 3 the design knowledge obtained by the partial correlation analysis and som satisfies the general knowledge about ship design 5 conclusion in this paper partial correlation analysis and som are applied to extract the design knowledge based on the optimised data of dtmb5415 the dtmb5415 design knowledge obtained using data mining tools can be summarised as follows 1 a longer bulb is beneficial for reducing the wave making resistance coefficient at both low and high speeds 2 the variation in the bulbous bow width has a little effect on the wave drag coefficient in each velocity section 3 at high speed u shape body plans of the bow are favourable for reducing the wave drag coefficient 4 as the speed increases the shape of the waterline changes from concave to a straight line in the design knowledge extraction partial correlation analysis and som are applied to acquire useful design knowledge regarding the hull forms the design knowledge can

22885,at present most hull form optimisation methods adopt some optimisation algorithms to search the design space to obtain an optimal solution these optimisation methods ignore the implicit relationship between optimisation variables and objective functions which often leads to low efficiency and difficulty in obtaining a global optimal solution if we can learn in advance the relevant design knowledge of a design space we can effectively determine the ship form optimisation and save time this paper proposes a knowledge extraction method based on two data mining techniques partial correlation analysis and self organising map som by considering numerical functions and dtmb5415 as the research objectives knowledge extraction is performed by combining the partial correlation analysis and som based on optimisation data through a comparative analysis of results the effectiveness of the data mining technology is verified and the obtained knowledge plays an important role in directing the ship form optimisation keywords data mining hull form optimisation design knowledge 1 introduction along with computational fluid dynamics cfd and rapid development in computer technology ship optimisation technology based on cfd has continuously developed in the optimisation of a ship form a large amount of optimisation data is needed to obtain the ideal optimisation objectives peri and campana 2005 kim and yang 2010 because of the complex interaction between the optimisation objectives and design variables implicit information on the data cannot be intuitively provided research on hull form optimisation only provides the optimal simulation results for data optimisation thus the design knowledge of the optimisation data are ignored to solve these problems data mining technology is introduced into the optimisation research from large incomplete noisy fuzzy and stochastic optimisation data rules and visual forms to extract the hidden design knowledge are used for guidance and understanding the ship optimisation problem in recent years data mining has attracted much attention as an effective data analysis tool for simulation for example wang et al 2004 mapped the optimisation performance space using the rough set theory and located noteworthy multiple subspaces by screening the excellent subspace of the performance objectives a large reduction in the design space was realised santana quintero et al 2010 used the rough set theory to identify better performance of a space used as a guide for optimisation of the genetic algorithm direction which greatly improved the efficiency of the optimisation algorithm diez et al 2014 and chen et al 2015 used the karhunen loeve expansion to evaluate the hull eliminate the factors with less influence and realised dimensionality reduction using few design variable modelling jeong et al 2005 obayashi et al 2007 and jeong and kim 2013 applied data mining technology for profile optimisation of an impeller and used the rough set theory and decision tree to extract the airfoil design rules to improve each objective viswanath et al 2010 mapped high dimensional data to a low dimensional hidden space using topology mapping optimised the hidden space in a low dimensional hidden space to identify the greatest advantages and sampled the high dimensional design space that corresponded to the greatest advantages of a low dimensional hidden space to obtain a new sample set and complete the space reduction zahir and gao 2012 proposed a space reduction method based on a low precision approximation model this method optimised the whole optimisation space using the low precision approximation model then analysed its search trajectory and determined the reduced space that was worthy of attention according to the problem of low optimisation efficiency in an aerodynamic configuration optimisation design of aircraft wu et al 2016 used the partial correlation analysis results to reduce the range of relevant design variables and reconstructed the optimal design space to extract the design knowledge between the hull design variables and objectives the current thesis optimises the wave drag of dtmb5415 using multiple froude numbers fr and then uses partial correlation analysis and a self organising map som to extract the design knowledge of the wave drag optimisation data this paper is divided into four parts the first part introduces the data mining technology the second part verifies the feasibility of the data mining technology design knowledge extraction using a mathematical function example the third part is based on the dtmb5415 hull form optimisation data and uses the data mining technology to carry out the design knowledge of the objective function and design variables the fourth part summaries the research contents 2 data mining technology in this study two data mining techniques are used to extract the design rules partial correlation analysis and som the partial correlation analysis can determine the relationship between the variables and objectives som can cluster the sample data project the high dimensional data with similar features to an adjacent area of a low dimensional space and directly analyse the data features 2 1 partial correlation analysis in statistics the process of describing the degree of linear correlation between the variables and expression of appropriate statistical indicators is called correlation analysis different correlation analysis methods can be used depending on the purpose of the study or the type of variables the commonly used correlation analysis theories are the following binary fixed length variable correlation analysis binary ordered variable correlation analysis and partial correlation analysis the partial correlation analysis needs to control the linear effect of other variables during analysis of the correlation mastering the data of multiple variables while calculating the partial correlation coefficient is necessary on the one hand the possible effects on the variables are considered on the other hand certain methods are used to control the other variables and to study the close degree of correlation between two variables to obtain a more accurate analysis to obtain more accurate and reliable mining information the partial correlation coefficient is selected to determine the linear correlation between the variables and objectives he 2007 the partial correlation coefficient is calculated using a correlation coefficient symmetric matrix which is composed of simple coefficients the simple correlation coefficient r ij of variables x i and x j can be expressed as 1 r i j x i x i x j x j x i x i 2 x j x j 2 the correlation coefficient symmetric matrix r is expressed as follows 2 r r 11 r 12 r 1 n r 21 r 22 r 2 n r n 1 r n 2 r n n the partial correlation coefficient r ij of variables x i and x j can be expressed as 3 r i j δ i j δ i i δ i i δ i j δ i i δ j j are algebraic cofactors corresponding to elements r ij r ii and r jj in the s correlation coefficient symmetric matrix from the above mentioned theory the correlation coefficient between the variables and objectives can be obtained by choosing appropriate data a positive or negative sign indicates a positive or negative correlation between the variable and object the coefficient size represents the linear correlation between the design variables and objectives if the absolute value of the coefficient is more than 0 4 we consider that a strong linear relationship exists between the variable and object otherwise a weaker linear relationship exists 2 2 som theory self organising map som neural network nn was first proposed by kohonen kohonen 1982 1988 1989 an unsupervised nn is used to cluster sample data sets into groups and high dimensional data with similar characteristics are then projected onto an adjacent area in a low dimensional space in this manner the data characteristics can be easily and intuitively analysed soms have been widely used in sample classification data visualisation spatial reduction and other related areas somnn has several noteworthy characteristics the network can adaptively change the parameters and structure within the network and can learn without supervision or any prior knowledge i e it is self organising nn contains a number of neurons and through the learning process the statistical features of the input are represented in various neuron connection weights if for some reason such as noise or hardware failure a neuron is damaged or fails the remaining neurons can retain the information to ensure that nn continues to function i e it is fault tolerant by adjusting the weights in the network through the training process the neurons in the network output layer are tuned to a specific input pattern therefore the neurons can generalise without requiring a large number of training samples somnn can project the high dimensional data onto the output layers of a two dimensional map the internal links among the data can be inspected thus the relationships are easily visualised owing to these characteristics somnn is useful for processing high dimensional data the design space can be selected for preliminary investigation using an appropriate number of samples the relationship between the design variables and design goals can be more readily analysed and the design space can be reduced 2 2 1 som neural network structure somnn contains two layers input and output layers the competitive layer as shown in fig 1 the input layer receives sample input vector x x1 x2 x n the number of neurons is equal to the sample dimension in the output layer each neuron is randomly assigned weight vector w w1 w2 w n the neurons compete with one another the weight vectors of the superior neurons and their adjacent neurons are iteratively updated the sample data are mapped into neurons with hexagonal meshes 2 3 introduction to som learning algorithms the som network uses an unsupervised learning algorithm when each sample is applied to the input layer the neurons in the output layer compete with one another based on distance measurement the weight vectors of the winning neuron and the adjacent neurons are adjusted after a sufficient number of training samples the distribution of the weight vectors becomes similar to the probability density distribution of the input samples i e the weight vector is closer to the input vector sample data with similar characteristics can be mapped onto the neurons adjacent to the output layer the specific steps of the som learning algorithm are described as follows 1 initialization a weight vector unit vector is randomly assigned for each neuron the output layer to obtain w w 1 w 2 w n where n is the dimension of the sample data at the input layer determine the initial winning area radius 0 and the initial learning rate η 0 0 η 0 1 2 input vector normalisation the input vector is composed of the values of the design variables and objective functions normalisation process is conducted to obtain vector x x 1 x 2 x n 3 similarity measurement euclidean distance d x i w j j 1 2 m is calculated where m is the number of neurons in the output layer between the input sample i and all neurons in the output layer neuron c with the shortest distance is determined to identify the winning neuron 4 weight vector adjustment the weights of the winning neuron c and the neurons in the adjacent areas are adjusted as follows 4 w t 1 w t η t h t x i w t in eq 4 η t and h t are the learning rate and the neighborhood function respectively both these functions decrease as time increases neighborhood function h t is a gaussian function 5 h t exp d c f 2 r 2 t where d cf is the distance between the winning neuron c and neuron f within the winning neighborhood and r is the radius of the winning field the radius r t and the learning rate η t both decrease as the number of training iterations t increases 6 r t 1 i n t r t 1 1 t t 1 7 η t 1 η t η 0 t 5 process repetition the next training sample is applied to the input layer and the process returns to step 2 until training count t is equal to chosen limit t by training using a sufficient number of samples the spatial distribution of the weight vectors of the neurons in the competition layer approximates the spatial probability distribution of the input pattern by inspecting the two dimensional map the relationships between the design goals and design variables can be analysed these relationships provide the basis for the design space reduction 3 numerical example the partial correlation analysis and som can both extract the trend of the variables and objectives the calculated partial correlation coefficient is clear and no error occurs from artificial judgment however the partial correlation analysis cannot fully analyse the relationship between each variable and the object in a weak liner function the computation of som is rather complicated and the generated map needs to be artificially determined however the related problems in nonlinear problems can be analysed and the distribution range of the variables can be provided therefore this study combines the two data mining technologies first partial correlation analysis is used for data mining if most of the variables and objective functions cannot be analysed then som can be used for data mining fig 2 shows the overall procedure the knowledge extraction framework in this study 3 1 design knowledge extraction of strong linear relation function different dimensional functions are used to verify the ability of the partial correlation analysis and som to analyse the relationship between the variables and objectives in a low dimension the two dimensional sum of squares function is used to test the methodology the two dimensional sum of squares function is defined as follows 8 f 2 s u m x y x 2 y 2 x y 0 1 the solution and minimum value are min f 2 s u m 0 0 0 the particle swarm optimisation pso algorithm is used to optimise the function the number of swarm particles is set to 50 the number of iterations is set to 10 for the optimised data the above mentioned data mining technologies are used to extract the design knowledge the partial correlation coefficients of the function variables and objects are listed in table 1 the partial correlation coefficients are 0 85 and 0 77 the linear relationship between the variables and object is positively correlated which means that the smaller the values of x and y in the optimisation space are the smaller is the object fig 3 shows the som variables and object identified by colours the solutions at the upper side have preferable f 2 s u m x y 0 the solutions at the upper part have relatively small values of x and y in high dimension six dimensional sum squares function is used to test the methodology the six dimensional sum squares function is defined as follows 9 f 6 s u m x i 6 x i 2 x i 0 3 the solution and minimum value are min f 6 s u m x f 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 the pso algorithm is used to optimise the function the number of swarm particles is set to 50 the number of iterations is set to 10 the partial correlation coefficients of the function variables and object are listed in table 2 the partial correlation coefficient between all variables and the object is greater than 0 4 a strong positive correlation exists between the variables and object fig 4 shows the som of the variables and object identified by colours the solutions at the upper side have preferable f 6 s u m x the solutions at the upper part have a relatively small value of x i the extracted design knowledge is consistent with that extracted by the partial correlation analysis the above example shows that the two methods can accurately extract the information contained in the function the data mining results of the partial correlation analysis and som in the strong linear relationship function are consistent they can be used as a design knowledge extraction tool 3 2 design knowledge extraction of a weak linear relationship function in a low dimension the mccormick function is applied to verify the ability of the partial correlation analysis and som to extract the design knowledge from weak linear relationships the function is expressed as 10 f m c c o r m i c k x y sin x y x y 2 1 5 x 2 5 y 1 where x 1 5 4 and y 3 4 the solution and minimum value are min f mccormick 0 54719 1 54718 1 933 the pso algorithm is used to optimise the function the number of swarm particles is set to 50 the number of iterations is set to 10 as listed in table 3 the partial correlation coefficient of x and the object is 0 64 a strong positively correlated linear relationship exists which means that x takes small values in optimisation space 1 5 4 which is conducive for obtaining an optimal solution however the coefficient between y and the object is 0 18 which cannot be quantitatively analysed fig 5 shows the som of the variables and object identified by colours the solutions at the upper part have preferable f m c c o r m i c k x y the range of values corresponding to the x and y map on the upper part are 1 26 0 17 and 2 58 0 74 therefore assigning a small value of variables x and y in optimisation spaces 1 5 4 and 3 4 is good for the function to obtain the optimal solution the result of the x analysis using som is consistent with that using the partial correlation analysis in a high dimension the six dimensional hartman function is used to verify the ability of the partial correlation analysis and som to extract the design knowledge from weak linear relationships the six dimensional hartman function is defined as follows 11 f h a r t m a n x i 1 4 c i exp j 1 6 a i j x j p i j 2 0 x j 1 where a i j 10 3 17 3 5 1 7 8 0 05 10 17 0 1 8 14 3 3 5 1 7 10 17 8 17 8 0 05 10 0 1 14 p i j 0 1312 0 1696 0 5569 0 0124 0 8283 0 5886 0 2329 0 4135 0 8307 0 3736 0 1004 0 9991 0 2348 0 1415 0 3522 0 3522 0 3047 0 6650 0 4047 0 8828 0 8732 0 5743 0 1091 0 0381 the solution and minimum value are min f hartman 0 201 0 15 0 477 0 275 0 311 0 657 3 322 the pso algorithm is used to optimise the function the number of swarm particles is set to 60 the number of iterations is set to 20 the partial correlation coefficients of the function variables and object are listed in table 4 small x 1 x 2 and x 5 values and a large x 6 value are necessary conditions for the hartman function however the coefficients between variables x 3 and x 4 and the object are too small to be quantitatively analysed fig 6 shows the som of the variables and object identified by colours the solutions at the upper part have preferable f hartman x as shown in fig 6 a the ranges of values corresponding to variables x 3 and x 4 in the map shown in fig 6 a are 0 46 0 53 and 0 24 0 35 therefore an intermediate x 3 value and a small x 4 value in optimisation space 0 1 are necessary conditions for the hartman function other som variables x 1 x 2 x 5 and x 6 are shown in fig 6 b we can learn that the design knowledge extracted by som is the same as that extracted by the partial correlation analysis thus we can obtain the following summary from the combination of the above examples the partial correlation coefficients can be easily obtained and no artificial judgment is required however the partial correlation analysis cannot fully analyse the relationship between each variable and the object in a weak liner function soms can be used for both linear and nonlinear problems and the range of variables can be quantitatively obtained 3 3 design knowledge extraction of multi objective function due to the defect of partial correlation analysis in nonlinearity and the nonlinear relationship in the function example can be clearly known only som is used for data mining in multi objective examples of functions in a low dimension the mccormick and schaffer functions are used to test the methodology the functions are defined as follows 12 f m c x y sin x y x y 2 1 5 x 2 5 y 1 f s c x y 0 5 sin 2 x 2 y 2 0 5 1 0 001 x 2 y 2 2 where x 1 5 4 and y 3 4 the solution and minimum value are min f m c 0 54719 1 54718 1 933 f s c 0 0 0 the multi objective pso mopso algorithm is used to optimise the function the number of swarm particles is set to 60 the number of iterations is set to 20 fig 7 shows the non dominated solutions obtained after mopso we can confirm that f mc and f sc exhibit a strong trade off relationship the som method is used to map and analyse the optimisation data to obtain the som map shown in fig 8 the maps show that the optimal value f x of the mccormick function is located near the lower part of the map as shown in the red box the optimal value f x of the schaffer function is located near the upper left part as shown in the black box in the red box we can see that the range of x can be reduced to 1 13 0 40 and y can be reduced to 2 29 0 74 thus small x and y value in optimisation space 1 5 4 and 3 4 are necessary conditions for the mccormick function in the black box we can see that the range of x can be reduced to 0 11 0 92 and y can be reduced to 0 72 0 32 thus a small x value and intermediate y value in optimisation spaces 1 5 4 and 3 4 are necessary conditions for the schaffer function the above mentioned design knowledge is consistent with the actual value of the optimal solution of the functions in a high dimension the six dimensional sum of squares function namely eq 9 and the six dimensional hartman function eq 11 are used to test the methodology the mopso algorithm is used to optimise the function the number of swarm particles is set to 60 the number of iterations is set to 20 where x i 0 1 i 1 2 6 the solution and minimum value are min f 6 s u m 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 f h a r t m a n 0 201 0 15 0 15 0 477 0 275 0 311 0 657 3 322 fig 9 shows the non dominated solutions obtained after mopso we can confirm that f 6sum and f hartman show a strong trade off relationship the som method is used to map and analyse the optimisation data to obtain the som shown in fig 10 optimal value f x of the six dimensional sum of squares function is located near the upper right part of the map as shown in the red box in the red box the range of x 1 x 6 can be reduced to 0 0 25 therefore small values of x 1 x 6 are necessary conditions for the six dimensional sum of squares function the maps show that optimal value f x of the hartman function is located near the upper left part of the map as shown in the black box in the black box we can see that the range of x 1 x 2 x 4 and x 5 can be reduced to 0 0 25 the range of x 3 can be reduced to 0 222 0 547 and the range of x 6 can be reduced to 0 547 0 708 therefore small values of x 1 x 2 x 4 and x 5 an intermediate value of x 3 and a large value of x 6 in optimisation space 0 1 are necessary conditions for the six dimensional hartman function the extraction design rules are the same as that presented in sections 2 1 and 2 2 by extracting the design knowledge from the single object and multi objective optimisations we obtain the following summary 1 in the strong linear function the partial correlation analysis and som can both accurately extract the same design knowledge 2 the partial correlation coefficients can be easily obtained and no artificial judgment is required however the partial correlation analysis cannot fully analyse the relationship between each variable and the object in a weak liner function 3 soms are applicable for both linear and nonlinear problems and the range of variables can be quantitatively obtained however the operation is more complicated and requires artificial judgment in the colour patch analysis in the subsequent research of engineering optimisation the linear nonlinear relationship between variables and targets cannot be judged in advance therefore we combine the two data mining techniques to extract the design knowledge first the partial correlation analysis is used for data mining if most of the variables and objective functions cannot be analysed som is used for data mining 4 data mining of dtmb5415 dtmb 5415 has a very well designed cone shaped sonar dome a transom stern and a slender hull body the main elements are listed in table 5 4 1 design knowledge extraction framework fig 11 shows the overall procedure of the design knowledge extraction framework in this study it consists of shape optimisation and design knowledge extraction in the shape optimisation the design space is explored using the mopso algorithm we use the radial basis function rbf interpolation method to realise the deformation of the ship hull surface the shipflow software is used as cfd solver in the design knowledge extraction we employ the design knowledge extraction method described in section 2 to realise the design knowledge extraction 4 2 shape optimisation of dtmb5415 4 2 1 description of the optimisation problem 1 optimisation objectives the present study is focused on the wave drag performance of hull form over a wide speed range therefore the objective functions of the optimisation are defined as follows f o b j 1 min c w 1 f r 1 0 22 f o b j 2 min c w 2 f r 2 0 28 f o b j 3 min c w 3 f r 3 0 41 where fr is froude number c w i denotes the wave drag coefficient of the hull form obtained during the optimisation process 2 optimisation variables eleven variable points are selected as shown in fig 12 where variable point x 3 changes along the x direction to control the length parameter of a sonar dome variable points y 1 y 2 and y 4 y 11 change along the y direction where variable points y 6 and y 9 control the width parameter of the sonar dome variable points y 1 y 5 y 7 and y 10 are arranged along the waterline to control the size of the inflow angle and shape of the inflow section on the waterline and y 2 y 4 y 8 and y 11 can have a great effect on the bilge line table 6 3 optimisation constraints 1 displacement constraint o p t 0 2 only the fore bodies can be modified and the length l breadth b draft t and stern lines are not changed the fixed points as shown in fig 13 4 2 2 hull surface modification method based on rbf interpolation we briefly introduce rbf for automatic modification kim et al 2008 2010 rbf is a type of real valued function that is symmetric along the radial direction whose value depends only on the euclidean distance between any point x and the centre of point x i buhmann 2004 the basis function is expressed as follows 13 φ x x i i 1 2 n where x i is the centre of rbf and φ is the rbf of the variable euclidean distance when rbf interpolation is used during hull form modification the function is defined as follows morris et al 2010 14 s x i 1 n λ i φ x x i p x where s x represents the displacement of point x x y z on the hull surface p x which is a low order polynomial is used to recover the translation and rotation and has the specific form p x c 1 x c 2 y c 3 z c 4 n is the number of control points and x x i is the euclidean distance between two points here the three dimensional wendland function with a compact support feature is adopted as the basis function 15 φ x 1 x 4 4 x 1 0 x 1 0 x 1 equation 15 guarantees that the constructed system matrix is a positive definite matrix equation coefficients λ i and c i are obtained by changing the control point coordinates morse et al 2001 16 s x i f i i 1 2 n where f i is the displacement of the control point additional requirements include the following 22 17 k 1 n λ k x k t 0 k 1 n λ k 0 the values of coefficients λ i and c i are obtained by solving the linear system 18 f 0 m q q t 0 λ c where λ λ 1 λ 2 λ n t c c 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 t f f 1 f 2 f n t m i j φ x i x j i j 1 2 n 19 q x 1 y 1 z 1 1 x 2 y 2 z 2 1 x n y n z n 1 all unknown coefficients in eq 14 can be obtained by solving eq 19 then the new coordinates for all unknown points can be obtained through rbf interpolation 4 2 3 mopso the optimisation problem is solved by mopso whose iteration is expressed as coello et al 2002 2004 20 v j i w v j i 1 c 1 r 1 p b e s t j p j i 1 c 2 r 2 g b e s t p j i 1 21 p j i p j i 1 v j i where p j i is the position of the jth swarm particle at the ith iteration pbest j is the best position ever visited by the jth particle personal optimum gbest is the position of the best overall optimum ever visited by all particles global optimum and v j is the particle speed coefficients w c 1 and c 2 are used to control the inertia and personal social behaviour of the swarm here w 0 8 and c 1 c 2 2 the number of swarm particles is set to 60 the number of iterations is set to 20 the multi objective procedures including the meta heuristics provide two main properties the first one must generate high quality non dominated solutions on the pareto front of the modm multi objective decision making problem the second one concerns a proper diversity for the generated solutions on the pareto front of the modm problem the simplicity and success of the simple pso among the other meta heuristic procedures result in the development of its multi objective variants the developed procedures in this part are roughly categorised into five main classes namely aggregating lexicographic sub population pareto based and combination of classes reyes sierra and coello coello 2006 4 2 4 validation of cfd the validation study for shipflow software is carried out before the optimisation shipflow is the flow solver for the potential flow around three dimensional bodies based on a surface singularity panel method for dtmb 5415 model the comparisons between experimental data and wave drag c w given by shipflow software and ittc formula c f are shown in fig 14 it can be seen from fig 14 that the drag coefficient predicted by shipflow software and ittc formula are in consistent agreement with the experimental measurements this demonstrates that the cfd calculation accuracy is guaranteed and it can be applied to the automatic optimisation of the hull form 4 2 5 optimisation result analysis fig 15 shows the non dominated solutions obtained after the multi objective shape optimisation we can confirm that cw 1 cw 3 and cw 2 cw 3 display a trade off relationship whereas cw 1 cw 2 displays a linear relationship this result implies that the performance in terms of the wave drag at low fr 0 22 and intermediate fr 0 28 design speeds is opposite to that at a high design speed fr 0 41 and the performance in terms of the wave drag at a low design speed is consistent with that at the intermediate design speed three typical optimum solutions cases 1 3 are selected among the non dominated solution employed to investigate the wave drag performance under different speed ranges as shown in fig 15 case 1 is a solution with low wave drag performance at a low design speed case 3 is a solution with low wave drag performance at a high design speed case 2 is compromise solution between cases 1 and 3 table 7 lists the values of the variables table 8 lists the variations in the geometric properties and percentages of the wave drag coefficients from those in the baseline configuration fig 16 shows the comparison of the wave drags r w between the initial and that of each of these three cases case 1 exhibits the best wave drag performance in the low speed range whereas case 3 exhibits the best wave drag performance in the high speed range as expected case 2 shows intermediate wave drag performance at all speed ranges the best wave drag performance in the high speed range 4 3 design knowledge extraction 4 3 1 partial correlation analysis partial correlation analysis is applied to data mining of the dtmb5415 optimised data the partial correlation coefficient among 11 design variables y 1 y 2 x 3 and y 4 y 11 and objectives f o b j 1 f o b j 2 and f o b j 3 are calculated using eqs 1 3 and the results are listed in table 9 according to the results y 1 x 3 y 7 and y 8 have a strong positive correlation with f o b j 1 y 2 has a strong negative correlation with f o b j 1 x 3 y 8 and y 10 have a strong positive correlation with f o b j 2 x 3 has a strong positive correlation with f o b j 3 f o b j 1 f o b j 2 and f o b j 3 are the drag performance at low intermediate and high speed we confirm that x 3 has a positive correlation with the wave drag coefficient at different speeds a longer sonar dome is beneficial to the wave drag coefficient under different fr s fig 17 shows the comparison of the body plans buttock lines and waterlines of the initial hull form with those in case 1 low speed hull form the arrow in fig 14 shows the trend of the optimisation variables compared with the initial hull form case 1 has a slightly wider section shape at the lower part near y 2 and a narrower waterline in the bow part near y 1 and y 7 the sonar dome length near x 3 is moderately elongated and the waterline of the bow is concave according to the general knowledge on ship design the waterline is thin and the inlet angle is small which are beneficial for reducing wave drag the concave waterline helps reduce the pressure along the ship forward direction of the bow thereby reducing drag at different speeds good wave drag performance is realised when the size and position of the bulbous bow are properly chosen therefore the design knowledge extracted by the partial correlation analysis satisfies the general knowledge about ship design at high speed the linear correlation between variables and targets is poor thus the design knowledge under high speed needs to be analysed using som 4 3 2 som at high speed som is applied to data mining of the dtmb5415 optimised data colours representing the output layer can be used to analyse the relationship between the wave drag coefficient and optimisation variables fig 18 shows that smaller f o b j 3 is distributed in the upper right portion of the map by observing the map of the design variables corresponding to the upper right neurons the colour patches of y 1 x 3 y 5 and y 10 in the area are blue whereas the colour patches of y 4 and y 11 in the area are red we can confirm that smaller values of y 1 x 3 y 5 and y 10 and larger values of y 4 and y 11 are beneficial in reducing the wave drag coefficient at high speed fig 19 shows the comparison of the body plans buttock lines and waterlines of the initial hull form with those in case 3 high speed hull form compared with the initial hull form case 3 has a slightly wider section shape at the lower part y 4 and y 11 and narrower waterlines in the bow part near y 1 y 5 and y 10 the body plan of the bow is deformed from v to u the sonar dome length near x 3 is moderately elongated and longer than that in case 1 the waterline is slightly thin and appears similar to a straight line according to the general knowledge on ship design at high speed the u shape body plans of the bow can reduce wave drag at high speed because more displacement is distributed below the waterline simultaneously an extreme u shape should be avoided to increase the bilge vortex the sonar dome length is longer than that at low speed because wavelengths increase with the speed of a ship when the ship speed increases the wave expands backward and the high pressure area expands thus the waterline must be thin and should be straight at high speed therefore the design knowledge extracted by som satisfies the general knowledge about ship design at high speed to verify the results of the partial correlation analysis the som method is used to map the data of f o b j 1 and f o b j 2 fig 20 shows that smaller f o b j 1 and f o b j 2 are distributed in the upper middle portion of the map by observing the map of the design variables corresponding to the upper middle neurons the colour patches of y 1 x 3 y 7 and y 8 are blue whereas the colour patch of y 2 is yellow we can confirm that smaller values of y 1 x 3 y 7 and y 8 and a larger value of y 2 are beneficial for reducing the wave drag coefficient at low speed the design knowledge extracted by som is consistent with that extracted by the partial correlation analysis thus the design knowledge obtained through the present data mining can be summarised as follows 1 case 1 low speed hull form has a slightly wider section shape at the lower part near y 2 and a narrower waterline in the bow part near y 1 and y 7 the bulbous length near x 3 is moderately elongated and the waterline of the bow is concave 2 case 3 high speed hull form has a slightly wider section shape at the lower part y 4 and y 11 and a narrower waterline in the bow part near y 1 y 5 and y 10 the body plans of the bow is deformed from v to u the bulbous length near x 3 is moderately elongated and longer than that in case 1 the waterline is slightly thin and appears similar to a straight line 3 the design knowledge obtained by the partial correlation analysis and som satisfies the general knowledge about ship design 5 conclusion in this paper partial correlation analysis and som are applied to extract the design knowledge based on the optimised data of dtmb5415 the dtmb5415 design knowledge obtained using data mining tools can be summarised as follows 1 a longer bulb is beneficial for reducing the wave making resistance coefficient at both low and high speeds 2 the variation in the bulbous bow width has a little effect on the wave drag coefficient in each velocity section 3 at high speed u shape body plans of the bow are favourable for reducing the wave drag coefficient 4 as the speed increases the shape of the waterline changes from concave to a straight line in the design knowledge extraction partial correlation analysis and som are applied to acquire useful design knowledge regarding the hull forms the design knowledge can help designers understand better and obtain some references and help in ship design and optimisation acknowledgments this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant

22886,in this study a rigorous poroelastodynamic solution is proposed for monopiles which accounts for 3d three dimensional dynamic interaction of the soil and pile the dynamic biot s theory is used to model the soil while timoshenko beam is used to model the monopile the perfect contact conditions between the soil and monopile are realized by decomposing the pile s horizontal translation to radial hoop and vertical displacements correspondingly 3d radial hoop and vertical stresses on the pile surface are used to formulate the governing equations of the interaction problem using the integral equation methods the governing differential equations are reduced to coupled integral equations which are solved numerically selected numerical results for coupled lateral and rocking dynamic impedances together with the 3d dynamic contact stresses at the soil pile interface are studied for different pile and poroelastic material parameters and frequencies of excitation the distributed soil reaction force and moment along the pile are also obtained by integrating the 3d radial hoop and vertical stresses along the circumference of the pile at the soil pile interface finally bending moment shear force horizontal translation and rocking rotation of the monopile are obtained based on the classical dynamic timoshenko beam theory keywords offshore wind turbines monopiles lateral vibration 3d wave equations biot equations 1 introduction monopiles are currently the most common foundation types for offshore wind turbines however the dynamic response of offshore wind turbines owts supported on monopiles is still a subject of considerable research partly due to the unconventional large diameter of monopiles and partly because of the lack of understanding of the dynamic interaction of saturated soil and monopiles compared to traditional piles monopiles have larger diameters and lower aspect ratios as low as 5 dynamic impedance of the monopile is a key parameter for evaluation of the dynamic response of the wind turbine however the dynamic interaction of monopiles with soil is still not well studied compared to traditional piles with larger aspect ratios most existing studies have considered the dynamic interaction of a slender pile with a single phased elastic soil e g novak 1974 novak and nogami 1977 gazetas and dobry 1984 rajapakse and shah 1987 kaynia and kausel 1991 for design purposes laterally loaded piles are often analyzed by p y curves e g ei naggar and bentley 2000 dnv os j101 2011 bisoi and haldar 2014 which depict the relationship between lateral soil resistance p and the corresponding lateral displacement y at different depths of the pile the response of monopiles has also been studied using small scale model tests e g bhattacharya et

traditional piles are often modelled using euler bernoulli beam with an equivalent flexural rigidity for non solid sections and with only distributed lateral reaction forces along the pile however for monopiles with large diameters and small aspect ratios the soil inside the monopile and the soil reaction moments caused by the vertical shear stresses along the pile could potentially affect the response of the pile these issues are addressed in this paper where the 3d biot wave equations are used for the soil and the timoshenko beam theory including both distributed forces and moments along the pile is used for the monopile the details of the process are given in the following sections 2 governing equations we consider the problem of a monopile buried in the seabed and subjected to time harmonic force and moment with circular frequency ω at pile head for simplicity of presentation the term e i ω t is omitted below from all the terms the outer radius of the monopile is a the length is l and the wall thickness is h with h a it is assumed that the displacements are small linear response then p r a θ z p θ a θ z and p z a θ z are used to indicate the radial hoop and vertical stresses acting on the surface of the pile respectively see fig 1 a for positive directions the distributed stresses p i a θ z i r θ z on the pile surface may be represented as 1 p i a θ z p i a z m 0 m a i m cos m θ b i m sin m θ where p i a z is the stress amplitude and a function of z only fig 1a the details of the unknown coefficients m a im and b im are described in section 3 1 the equivalent

monopile is subjected to unit vertical radial and hoop ring loads at plane z c the amplitude of the distributed loads can be represented as δ z c where δ is the dirac delta function these distributed

written as 24 w x 0 0 ϕ 0 0 the shear force and bending moment at the base of the pile are assumed zero although this method is developed for pipe piles it may also be used to study solid piles by

half space could be determined by the boundary conditions refer to he 2014 for the details 4 coupled dynamic pile soil response using the green s functions obtained in the preceding section one can

equation 41 can be solved numerically and for details of the solution methodology refer to he et al 2017 5 numerical results for practical engineering purposes the dynamic responses of a monopile embedded in three saturated sands with different relative densities referred to as loose medium dense and dense are studied the material properties of these sands are listed in table 1 besides e p 200 10 9 pa and ν p 0 3 are used for the steel pile for a free head pile subjected to horizontal load f 0 and moment m 0 on the top of the pile the corresponding displacement u h and rotation θ can be expressed by 42 u h f 0 k h m 0 k h m θ m 0 k m f 0 k h m where k h k h m and k m are the horizontal cross coupled and rocking impedance respectively non dimensional impedance coefficients are defined as 43 k h k h μ s a k h m k h m μ s a 2 k m k m μ s a 3 moreover all the quantities below with a bar mean dimensionless quantities and their definitions can be found in the corresponding figures 5 1 comparison with existing solutions for validation of the developed model the results are compared with the existing solutions for a solid pile in an elastic half space by rajapakse and shah 1987 and for a single pile in layered half space by kaynia 1982 the solution for a pile in a single phased elastic soil was obtained from the present model by setting b n and ρ f to small values almost zero close agreement between the results of rajapakse and shah and the present method is observed in fig 3 which validates the developed green s functions and the numerical implementations the comparisons of k m and k h with kaynia 1982 are also good however there is a larger deviation in this comparison which is believed to be partly due to the use of the euler s beam theory by kaynia 1982 and partly due to the fact that kaynia 1982 ignored the unsymmetrical vertical shear stresses on the pile surface which might have a non negligible effect on the horizontal response of large diameter piles 5 2 numerical results for the dynamic impedances dynamic impedance functions are important in offshore wind turbine designs due to the dynamic sensitivity of these structures in order to study the impedance functions the sensitivity of the dimensionless impedance functions are studied in this section for the following parameters a non dimensional frequency ω ω a μ s ρ b shear modulus ratio e p μ s c thickness radius ratio h a d non dimensional resistive damping b b a ρ μ s and e pile length to radius ratio l a the influence of ω on the dimensionless impedance functions are presented in fig 4 here re stands for real part and im stands for imaginary part which represent stiffness and damping respectively the figure shows that for a monopile with l a 12 and h a 0 02 in sand the quantities re k h re k h m and re k m change gently with frequency ω while im k h im k h m and im k m increase almost linearly with ω when ω 0 1 fig 5 presents the effect of variation of shear modulus ratio on the impedances which shows that for a monopile with l a 12 and h a 0 02 in sand k h k h m and k m increase almost exponentially with e p μ s in the range e p μ s 10 3 10 6 for a steel monopile with e p 200 10 9 pa e p μ s 10 3 10 6 corresponds to the shear modulus of the soil in the range 0 2 mpa and 200 mpa fig 6 presents the sensitivity of the impedances to the pile s wall thickness for the non dimensional frequency ω 0 3 this value is chosen as the average in the range considered for the results in fig 4 and because it represents the higher modes in owts which are believed to be more important as the size of turbines increases the figure reveals that for a monopile with l a 12 the impedances k h k h m and k m increase with h a but the rate of increase differs for sand with different stiffness an interesting issue is the effect of permeability on the dynamic behavior of the monopiles in porous media especially damping due to water flow in the pores damgaard et al 2014 studied the influence of permeability on pile stiffness by a two dimensional finite element model while 3d semi analytical results are given here the parameter b ρ f g n 2 k f defined in section 2 1 actually represents the damping due to the relative motion between the solid part and the fluid part biot 1962 fig 7 presents the influence of b on the dimensionless impedance functions which indicates that for a monopile with l a 12 and h a 0 02 the dimensionless impedances increase gently with b when b 10 and remain almost constant when b 10 moreover a monopile in loose sand is influenced most strongly by this parameter fig 8 shows the influence of monopile s length to radius ratio l a on the impedances for the monopile in the three sands one can observe that for monopiles in dense sand the impedances of piles with l a in the range 6 16 remain fairly constant which means in order to increase the dimensional impedances in dense sand it is more useful to increase the radius than the length of the pile for the monopile in loose sand the real part of the impedances has tendencies to increase from l a 6 to l a 12 with the re k m increasing most while the imaginary part tends to increase initially and decrease afterwards with im k m decreasing most the trends of the results for the monopile in medium dense sand seem to lie between those of the dense and loose sand 5 3 simple formulas for impedance functions for practical engineering use an attempt has been made in the following to use a symbolic regression method koza 1994 schmidt and lipson 2009 to fit simple formulas to the impedances as functions of the parameters considered in this study namely 44 k f l e h b ω where e e p μ s l l a and h h a the results for the k h are given in 45 and 46 45 re k

with caution these formulas are applied in an example in the following we assume a monopile with radius a 4 0 m length l 32 0 m h 80 mm e p 200 gpa embedded in loose sand refer to table 1 subjected to a horizontal load 3 mn and a rocking moment 120 mn m at a frequency f 1 0 hz the non dimensional quantities are 54 l l a 8 e e p μ s 33333 h h a 0 02 ω 2 π f a μ s ρ 0 41 b ρ f g n 2 k f a ρ μ s 102 1

soil monopile interaction due to pile head loads to better understand the interaction between the soil and the monopile it is helpful to study the distribution of the resultant dynamic interaction stresses p z z p r z and p θ z on the 3d interface of the monopile and the soil fig 9 a f show the variations with depth of p z z p r z and p θ z in a monopile with l a 12 in the medium dense sand at frequencies ω 0 1 and ω 0 3 due to a pure horizontal force or a pure rocking moment the figures reveal that ω has a major influence on the imaginary parts of p r z p z z and p θ z it can also be observed that p r z p z z and p θ z in the upper half of the pile are larger than those in the lower half for the pure horizontal force case while p r z p z z and p θ z are relatively uniform along the pile for the pure rocking moment for the imaginary part it means the responses lag behind the excitations which reflect the influence of radiation damping for practical engineering purposes it is useful to integrate the 3d soil pile tractions to obtain the distributed forces f z and moments m z along the pile treated as a beam the results are illustrated in fig 10 which show that both f z and m z in the upper half of the pile are larger than in the lower half under the pure horizontal force while they distribute relatively uniformly due to the rocking moment it can also be observed in fig 10 that force singularities exist at both the top and bottom of the pile the deflections and rotations of the monopile in medium dense sand due to horizontal load and moment acting separately are shown in fig 11 the reason for the piecewise linear variations is the use of linear interpolation functions for the defection of the pile it can be seen that re w x z is larger at the lower frequency ω 0 1 re θ z shows little difference between the two frequencies ω 0 1 and ω 0 3 and im w x z and im θ z are larger at the higher frequency ω 0 3 it can also be concluded from fig 11 that the monopile does not behave like a rigid body and the imaginary part which reflects the effect of damping is practically negligible for the frequencies considered the results of shear force h z and bending moment m z of the monopile in medium dense sand due to the horizontal force h 0 or bending moment m 0 on top of the pile are presented in fig 12 the plots indicate that the bending moment m z caused by the top moment m 0 decreases gradually along the pile while the distribution of the shear force h z caused by the pure horizontal load h 0 has larger variations the results presented above can be combined to obtain the internal forces for any combinations of horizontal loads and moments a practical way of showing the combined effect of these loads is use of load eccentricity e l t d if h 0 denotes the lateral load from the wave or wind l t is the height of this load from the mudline d 2a is the diameter of the monopile then the results for two normalized eccentricities e 5 and e 15 which can approximately represent the wave loading and wind loading respectively zdravkovic et al 2015 are presented in fig 13 the figure displays the influence of e on the internal pile forces due to soil pile interaction for these two cases 6 conclusions a rigorous solution for the lateral dynamic response of a monopile foundation embedded in a porous seabed has been presented in this paper the soil in the model is modelled by green s functions for ring loads in a biot soil and the pile is modelled by a 3d steel pipe section from the numerical results for the considered monopile the following observations have been made 1 re k h re k h m and re k m change only slightly with increasing ω while im k h im k h m and im k m increase almost linearly with ω when ω 0 1 2 k h k h m and k m increase

22886,in this study a rigorous poroelastodynamic solution is proposed for monopiles which accounts for 3d three dimensional dynamic interaction of the soil and pile the dynamic biot s theory is used to model the soil while timoshenko beam is used to model the monopile the perfect contact conditions between the soil and monopile are realized by decomposing the pile s horizontal translation to radial hoop and vertical displacements correspondingly 3d radial hoop and vertical stresses on the pile surface are used to formulate the governing equations of the interaction problem using the integral equation methods the governing differential equations are reduced to coupled integral equations which are solved numerically selected numerical results for coupled lateral and rocking dynamic impedances together with the 3d dynamic contact stresses at the soil pile interface are studied for different pile and poroelastic material parameters and frequencies of excitation the distributed soil reaction force and moment along the pile are also obtained by integrating the 3d radial hoop and vertical stresses along the circumference of the pile at the soil pile interface finally bending moment shear force horizontal translation and rocking rotation of the monopile are obtained based on the classical dynamic timoshenko beam theory keywords offshore wind turbines monopiles lateral vibration 3d wave equations biot equations 1 introduction monopiles are currently the most common foundation types for offshore wind turbines however the dynamic response of offshore wind turbines owts supported on monopiles is still a subject of considerable research partly due to the unconventional large diameter of monopiles and partly because of the lack of understanding of the dynamic interaction of saturated soil and monopiles compared to traditional piles monopiles have larger diameters and lower aspect ratios as low as 5 dynamic impedance of the monopile is a key parameter for evaluation of the dynamic response of the wind turbine however the dynamic interaction of monopiles with soil is still not well studied compared to traditional piles with larger aspect ratios most existing studies have considered the dynamic interaction of a slender pile with a single phased elastic soil e g novak 1974 novak and nogami 1977 gazetas and dobry 1984 rajapakse and shah 1987 kaynia and kausel 1991 for design purposes laterally loaded piles are often analyzed by p y curves e g ei naggar and bentley 2000 dnv os j101 2011 bisoi and haldar 2014 which depict the relationship between lateral soil resistance p and the corresponding lateral displacement y at different depths of the pile the response of monopiles has also been studied using small scale model tests e g bhattacharya et

traditional piles are often modelled using euler bernoulli beam with an equivalent flexural rigidity for non solid sections and with only distributed lateral reaction forces along the pile however for monopiles with large diameters and small aspect ratios the soil inside the monopile and the soil reaction moments caused by the vertical shear stresses along the pile could potentially affect the response of the pile these issues are addressed in this paper where the 3d biot wave equations are used for the soil and the timoshenko beam theory including both distributed forces and moments along the pile is used for the monopile the details of the process are given in the following sections 2 governing equations we consider the problem of a monopile buried in the seabed and subjected to time harmonic force and moment with circular frequency ω at pile head for simplicity of presentation the term e i ω t is omitted below from all the terms the outer radius of the monopile is a the length is l and the wall thickness is h with h a it is assumed that the displacements are small linear response then p r a θ z p θ a θ z and p z a θ z are used to indicate the radial hoop and vertical stresses acting on the surface of the pile respectively see fig 1 a for positive directions the distributed stresses p i a θ z i r θ z on the pile surface may be represented as 1 p i a θ z p i a z m 0 m a i m cos m θ b i m sin m θ where p i a z is the stress amplitude and a function of z only fig 1a the details of the unknown coefficients m a im and b im are described in section 3 1 the equivalent

comparison with existing solutions for validation of the developed model the results are compared with the existing solutions for a solid pile in an elastic half space by rajapakse and shah 1987 and for a single pile in layered half space by kaynia 1982 the solution for a pile in a single phased elastic soil was obtained from the present model by setting b n and ρ f to small values almost zero close agreement between the results of rajapakse and shah and the present method is observed in fig 3 which validates the developed green s functions and the numerical implementations the comparisons of k m and k h with kaynia 1982 are also good however there is a larger deviation in this comparison which is believed to be partly due to the use of the euler s beam theory by kaynia 1982 and partly due to the fact that kaynia 1982 ignored the unsymmetrical vertical shear stresses on the pile surface which might have a non negligible effect on the horizontal response of large diameter piles 5 2 numerical results for the dynamic impedances dynamic impedance functions are important in offshore wind turbine designs due to the dynamic sensitivity of these structures in order to study the impedance functions the sensitivity of the dimensionless impedance functions are studied in this section for the following parameters a non dimensional frequency ω ω a μ s ρ b shear modulus ratio e p μ s c thickness radius ratio h a d non dimensional resistive damping b b a ρ μ s and e pile length to radius ratio l a the influence of ω on the dimensionless impedance functions are presented in fig 4 here re stands for real part and im stands for imaginary part which represent stiffness and damping respectively the figure shows that for a monopile with l a 12 and h a 0 02 in sand the quantities re k h re k h m and re k m change gently with frequency ω while im k h im k h m and im k m increase almost linearly with ω when ω 0 1 fig 5 presents the effect of variation of shear modulus ratio on the impedances which shows that for a monopile with l a 12 and h a 0 02 in sand k h k h m and k m increase almost exponentially with e p μ s in the range e p μ s 10 3 10 6 for a steel monopile with e p 200 10 9 pa e p μ s 10 3 10 6 corresponds to the shear modulus of the soil in the range 0 2 mpa and 200 mpa fig 6 presents the sensitivity of the impedances to the pile s wall thickness for the non dimensional frequency ω 0 3 this value is chosen as the average in the range considered for the results in fig 4 and because it represents the higher modes in owts which are believed to be more important as the size of turbines increases the figure reveals that for a monopile with l a 12 the impedances k h k h m and k m increase with h a but the rate of increase differs for sand with different stiffness an interesting issue is the effect of permeability on the dynamic behavior of the monopiles in porous media especially damping due to water flow in the pores damgaard et al 2014 studied the influence of permeability on pile stiffness by a two dimensional finite element model while 3d semi analytical results are given here the parameter b ρ f g n 2 k f defined in section 2 1 actually represents the damping due to the relative motion between the solid part and the fluid part biot 1962 fig 7 presents the influence of b on the dimensionless impedance functions which indicates that for a monopile with l a 12 and h a 0 02 the dimensionless impedances increase gently with b when b 10 and remain almost constant when b 10 moreover a monopile in loose sand is influenced most strongly by this parameter fig 8 shows the influence of monopile s length to radius ratio l a on the impedances for the monopile in the three sands one can observe that for monopiles in dense sand the impedances of piles with l a in the range 6 16 remain fairly constant which means in order to increase the dimensional impedances in dense sand it is more useful to increase the radius than the length of the pile for the monopile in loose sand the real part of the impedances has tendencies to increase from l a 6 to l a 12 with the re k m increasing most while the imaginary part tends to increase initially and decrease afterwards with im k m decreasing most the trends of the results for the monopile in medium dense sand seem to lie between those of the dense and loose sand 5 3 simple formulas for impedance functions for practical engineering use an attempt has been made in the following to use a symbolic regression method koza 1994 schmidt and lipson 2009 to fit simple formulas to the impedances as functions of the parameters considered in this study namely 44 k f l e h b ω where e e p μ s l l a and h h a the results for the k h are given in 45 and 46 45 re k h 8 36 3100 h ω 19 7 b 18 1 0 15 e l h 3 56 l 0 38 e h 1 93 ω with r 2 0 97 mean absolute error 0 1 maximum error 0 6 46 im k h 43 8 h 42 1 31 165 b 0 386 ω e ω l 2 0 282 0 353 with r 2 0 98 mean absolute error 0 2 maximum error 0 8 the results for k h m are expressed in 47 and 48 47 re k h m 23 3 68 2 l b 4 19 e h 0 65 e h l 21 5 ω with r 2 0 98 mean absolute error 1 6 maximum error 8 6 48 im

l 2 98 e h l 13 4 ω 389 with r 2 0 99 mean absolute error 3 4 maximum error 30 9 50 im k m 0 0325 e ω h 1 46 0 000477 e 0 00124 b 0 0001955 ω e 2 h 2 with r 2 0 96 mean absolute error 1 8 maximum error 30 8 a simpler version can be expressed as 51 re k m 3 86 e l h 3 75 l with r 2 0 98 mean absolute error 6 9 maximum error 67 5 52 im k m 0 435 e ω h ω 8 99 ω with r 2 0 96 mean absolute error 2 8 maximum error 28 4 it should be noted that these formulas are fitted with the parameters in the range 53 6 l 16 1000 e 50000 0 01 h 0 06 0 01 ω 0 5 10 3 b 10 4 and should be used outside this range with caution these formulas are applied in an example in the following we assume a monopile with radius a 4 0 m length l 32 0 m h 80 mm e p 200 gpa embedded in loose sand refer to table 1 subjected to a horizontal load 3 mn and a rocking moment 120 mn m at a frequency f 1 0 hz the non dimensional quantities are 54 l l a 8 e e p μ s 33333 h h a 0 02 ω 2 π f a μ s ρ 0 41 b ρ f g n 2 k f a ρ μ s 102 1 which by substituting in formulas 45 50 yield the following non dimensional impedances 55 k h 10 3 8 0 i k h m 67 9 32 4 i k m 227 3 81 7 i by substituting these values into 43 one gets the impedances 56 k h k h μ s a 2 5 1 9 i 10 8 n m k h m k h m μ s a 2 6 5 3 1 i 10 9 n k m k m μ s a 3 8 7 3 1 i 10 10 n m finally using eq 42 one may compute the resulting pile head motions 57 u h 22 6 13 0 i mm θ 0 091 0 035 i 0 which means an amplitude u h 26 1 mm with phase lag φ u 30 0 0 the displacement response lags behind the excitation force and θ 0 098 0 with phase lag φ θ 21 2 0 5 4 characteristics of soil monopile interaction due to pile head loads to better understand the interaction between the soil and the monopile it is helpful to study the distribution of the resultant dynamic interaction stresses p z z p r z and p θ z on the 3d interface of the monopile and the soil fig 9 a f show the variations with depth of p z z p r z and p θ z in a monopile with l a 12 in the medium dense sand at frequencies ω 0 1 and ω 0 3 due to a pure horizontal force or a pure rocking moment the figures reveal that ω has a major influence on the imaginary parts of p r z p z z and p θ z it can also be observed that p r z p z z and p θ z in the upper half of the pile are larger than those in the lower half for the pure horizontal force case while p r z p z z and p θ z are relatively uniform along the pile for the pure rocking moment for the imaginary part it means the responses lag behind the excitations which reflect the influence of radiation damping for practical engineering purposes it is useful to integrate the 3d soil pile tractions to obtain the distributed forces f z and moments m z along the pile treated as a beam the results are illustrated in fig 10 which show that both f z and m z in the upper half of the pile are larger than in the lower half under the pure horizontal force while they distribute relatively uniformly due to the rocking moment it can also be observed in fig 10 that force singularities exist at both the top and bottom of the pile the deflections and rotations of the monopile in medium dense sand due to horizontal load and moment acting separately are shown in fig 11 the reason for the piecewise linear variations is the use of linear interpolation functions for the defection of the pile it can be seen that re w x z is larger at the lower frequency ω 0 1 re θ z shows little difference between the two frequencies ω 0 1 and ω 0 3 and im w x z and im θ z are larger at the higher frequency ω 0 3 it can also be concluded from fig 11 that the monopile does not behave like a rigid body and the imaginary part which reflects the effect of damping is practically negligible for the frequencies considered the results of shear force h z and bending moment m z of the monopile in medium dense sand due to the horizontal force h 0 or bending moment m 0 on top of the pile are presented in fig 12 the plots indicate that the bending moment m z caused by the top moment m 0 decreases gradually along the pile while the distribution of the shear force h z caused by the pure horizontal load h 0 has larger variations the results presented above can be combined to obtain the internal forces for any combinations of horizontal loads and moments a practical way of showing the combined effect of these loads is use of load eccentricity e l t d if h 0 denotes the lateral load from the wave or wind l t is the height of this load from the mudline d 2a is the diameter of the monopile then the results for two normalized eccentricities e 5 and e 15 which can approximately represent the wave loading and wind loading respectively zdravkovic et al 2015 are presented in fig 13 the figure displays the influence of e on the internal pile forces due to soil pile interaction for these two cases 6 conclusions a rigorous solution for the lateral dynamic response of a monopile foundation embedded in a porous seabed has been presented in this paper the soil in the model is modelled by green s functions for ring loads in a biot soil and the pile is modelled by a 3d steel pipe section from the numerical results for the considered monopile the following observations have been made 1 re k h re k h m and re k m change only slightly with increasing ω while im k h im k h m and im k m increase almost linearly with ω when ω 0 1 2 k h k h m and k m increase with e p μ s within the range e p μ s 10 3 10 6 3 k h k h m and k m increase almost linearly with h a within the range h a 0 01 0 06 4 k h k h m and k m increase gently with increasing the dimensionless damping b within the range b 10 5 length ratio l a has a stronger influence on monopile embedded in loose sand than in denser sands moreover using the computed results simple formulas

22887,an accurate added mass model representation for a flexible elliptical cylinder vibrating in water is presented to accomplish this the analytical expressions for the hydrodynamic forces on elliptical cylinders are first derived in the elliptical coordinate system then explicit expressions for computing the free vibration response of the elliptical cylinder vibrating in water like natural frequencies and mode shapes are given by solving the coupled differential equations the expressions for calculating the forced vibration responses of a flexible cylinder surrounded by water are further given however the expressions of the exact model are too complicated and require the use of computer program to generate the results based on the fundamental frequency reduction rate a simple formula for the added mass representation is proposed to simulate a flexible elliptical cylinder vibrating in water the simple formula for evaluating the natural frequencies and the simple model for evaluating the seismic responses of the submerged cylinder are also presented in the study keywords earthquake fluid structure interaction elliptical cylinder added mass simplified formula 1 introduction the dynamic response behaviour of structures surrounded by water such as intake towers oil storage tanks and bridge piers is influenced by the surrounding water structures located in a seismic region will inevitably suffer from earthquakes in the form of associated hydrodynamic pressures therefore when designing submerged structures it is extremely important to evaluate the changes in the hydrodynamic pressure during earthquakes many researchers have studied the hydrodynamic pressure on submerged structures liaw and chopra 1974 and tanaka and hudspeth 1988 utilized the analytical method and williams 1986 utilized the boundary integral method to calculate the dynamic response of circular cylinders subjected to horizontal ground excitation these results illustrate the decrease in the natural frequencies of the cylinders due to the presence of the surrounding water and the effects of surrounding water hydrodynamic pressure can be conveniently modeled as the product of a hypothetical mass of water and the acceleration of the structure chen 1997 developed a finite difference scheme to solve nonlinear hydrodynamic pressures acting on a rigid circular cylinder during earthquakes it was determined that the hydrodynamic pressure profile increases as the size factor defined as the ratio of diameter of the cylinder to water depth increases liao 1985 and williams 1987 investigated the hydrodynamic interactions between submerged circular cylinders the results indicate that the hydrodynamic interaction is negligible when the relative distance defined as the ratio of the distance between the centers of the cylinders to the sum of the radius of cylinders exceeds 4 while it becomes relevant when the relative distance is less than 2 in addition the earthquake induced hydrodynamic pressure on axisymmetric cylinders was investigated by some researchers such as liaw and chopra 1975 sun and nogami 1991 park et al 1991 and avilés and li 2001 the analytical methods liaw and chopra 1974 tanaka and hudspeth 1988 and numerical methods liaw and chopra 1975 williams 1986 sun and nogami 1991 can be used to accurately simulate the water structure interaction however these methods are not convenient for engineering applications therefore some simplified methods have been developed in recent decades it is already known that when a submerged structure vibrates in incompressible water a part of the water around the structure acts upon it as an added mass currently the value of the added mass that represent the inertia influence of water in contact with a structure is obtained by one of two methods the first method is assuming the structure is rigid and computing an added mass to reproduce the hydrodynamic pressure on the vibrating structure li and yang 2013 du et al 2014 and jiang et al 2017 presented the simplified formulas of the added mass for rigid circular cylinders goyal and chopra 1989 developed a simplified procedure to evaluate the added mass for a rigid intake tower with a two symmetric axes cross section those simplified formulas of the added mass are not only convenient but also sufficiently accurate for practical applications the other method is to obtain the added mass based on the fundamental frequency reduction rate of the flexible structure han and xu 1996 yang and li 2013 han and xu 1996 presented a theoretical model of an added mass representation for a flexible circular cylinder vibrating in water and presented a simple formula for evaluating the natural frequencies using the added mass representation yang and li 2013 calculated the added mass for flexible cylinders with an arbitrary cross section where the fundamental frequency reduction rate was obtained by the finite element method there is excellent agreement with the natural frequencies computed from the analytical model and the simple model han and xu 1996 cylinders with elliptical cross sections are currently under consideration for use as bridge piers offshore oil production and storage facilities compared with circular cylinder the stiffness of the elliptical cylinder along the direction of major and minor axes is different thus the elliptical cylinders can reduce the construction costs when the loads on offshore structures along the direction of major and minor axes are quite different consequently the efficient determination of earthquake induced hydrodynamic pressure on such cylinders has become of considerable practical interest recently wang et al 2018 presented simplified formulas for the added mass for rigid elliptical cylinders however the simple model of an added mass representation for a flexible elliptical cylinder vibrating in water has not been well studied in addition a simple and accurate added mass model for simulating the water cylinder interaction under an earthquake action has not been given in this work a simple added mass model is proposed for the dynamic analysis of flexible elliptical cylinders surrounded by water to accomplish this an exact model for the fluid structure interaction including an elliptical cylinder freely vibrating in water and undergoing forced vibration from seismic loading is proposed based on the analytical solution for the hydrodynamic forces however the expressions of the exact model are too complicated and require the use of a computer program to generate the results therefore a simple model is developed where the added mass representation for the rigid motion is obtained by assuming the structure rigid and the added mass representation for the elastic vibration is obtained by the fundamental frequency reduction rate it should be noted that the estimation of the added mass for simulating the fluid structure interaction in other fields is also important such as the flapping flight see for example the research presented by lefrançois 2017 la mantia and dabnichki 2013 and references therein 2 exact solution for the fluid structure interaction the fluid is assumed to be irrotational incompressible and inviscid a cantilevered elliptical cylinder of semi major a semi minor axes b and submerged in a fluid of constant depth h is subjected to earthquake loading as shown in fig 1 the nomenclature is shown in table 1 the cylinder is assumed to be linearly elastic and it is treated as a one dimensional structure governed by beam theory the bottom of the cylinder is fixed at the rigid ground the water is treated as calm before the action of the earthquake and only the radiation wave is simulated under earthquake according to liaw and chopra 1974 and li and yang 2013 the free surface wave is of little consequence in the earthquake response of towers surrounded by water therefore free surface waves are assumed to not be generated in this study 2 1 solutions for hydrodynamic forces a harmonic wave with frequency ω is considered here as the seismic excitation the ground motion can be expressed as u g t u g e i ω t and the displacement of the cylinder relative to the ground motion can be expressed as u t u e i ω t where t is time and u g and u are the displacement of the ground and the deformation of the cylinder in the frequency domain respectively based on the elliptical coordinate system wang et al 2018 derived the analytical solution of the hydrodynamic forces on a rigid elliptical cylinder surrounded by water subjected to earthquake loading the expressions of the hydrodynamic forces on a flexible elliptical cylinder surrounded by water will be deduced using the same method the elliptic coordinate system is depicted in fig 2 the governing equation in the fluid domain is the laplace equation which in an elliptical coordinate system ξ η z is 1 2 μ 2 cosh 2 ξ cos 2 η

in the direction of the minor axis of an elliptical cylinder the symmetry conditions about the η 0 5π plan are given by the follows 6a p η η 0 5 π 0 6b p η 0 0 4 the pressure waves propagate away from the structure and decay with the travelling distance so the hydrodynamic pressure at infinity is zero as follows 7 p ξ 0 5 in the case of ground motion in the direction of the major axis of elliptical cylinder p should satisfy the following 8 p ξ ξ ξ 0 ρ 2 u s 2 t b cos η and in the case of ground motion in the direction of the minor axis of elliptical cylinder p should satisfy the following 9 p ξ

between the two studies are tabulated in table 2 it is seen that good agreements are observed 2 3 forced vibration it is assumed that the cylinder can only be distorted in the first n mode shapes of vibration in a vacuum liaw and chopra 1974 therefore the elastic displacement of the cylinder under an earthquake action in the time domain can be written as follows 33 u i 1 n ϕ i z χ i t where ϕ i z are the mode shapes in a vacuum and χ i t are generalized coordinates employing the superposition method of mode of vibration and using the orthogonality of the mode shapes in water the equation of

on the dynamic properties and dynamic responses of elliptical cylinders the free and forced vibration responses of a flexible cylinder fully submerged in water are studied and compared with the results of vibration in a vacuum 3 1 free vibration response the free vibration responses of an elliptical cylinder vibrating in water and in a vacuum are performed using the following data ρ 1000 kg m3 ρ s 2500 kg m3 e 30000 mpa and h 40m the first three frequencies of free vibration are computed from eq 31 fig 3 a and b shows the fundamental frequency reduction rate τ against b h and a h in the case of the cylinder vibrating along the direction of the major axis and minor axis with different a b respectively where τ is defined as τ ω 0 ω i ω 0 it can be seen that a cylinder vibrates at a slower frequency in water than in a vacuum and the relative difference in frequencies decreases as the ratio b h or a h increases which is mainly because the added mass per unit length decreases as the ratio b h or a h increases wang et al 2018 it can also be seen that the fundamental frequency reduction rate τ decreases as the ratio a b increases in the case of the cylinder vibrating along the major axis while it increases as the ratio a b increases in the case of the cylinder vibrating along the minor axis this phenomenon is mainly caused by the fact that the added mass per unit length decreases as the ratio a b increases in the case of the cylinder vibrating along the major axis while it increases as the ratio a b increases in the case of the cylinder vibrating along the minor axis wang et al 2018 fig 4 a and b shows the frequency reduction rate τ for the first three modes against b h and a h in the case of the cylinder vibrating along the major axis and minor axis with a b 2 respectively the results indicate that fluid structure interaction has a greater influence on the second natural frequencies than the first and third natural frequencies figs 5 and 6 show the first three modes in the case of a cylinder b h 0 2 vibrating along the direction of the major axis and in the case of the cylinder a h 0 5 vibrating along the direction of the minor axis with a b 3 respectively it can be seen that the fundamental vibration modes in water and in a vacuum are identical while for the higher modes their differences become more obvious especially in the case of a cylinder vibrating along the minor axis this phenomenon may be because that the displacement of the cylinder in the first modes increases from the base to the top 3 2 forced vibration response the forced vibration response of an elliptical cylinder vibrating in water and in a vacuum are performed using the following data h 40m a b 3 and ζ i 0 02 the displacement time histories of the ground motion are shown in fig 7 fig 8 a and b shows the relative displacement responses at the top of the cylinder with b h 0 2 in the case of ground motion along the major axis and with a h 0 5 in the case of ground motion along the minor axis it can be seen that the fluid structure interaction has a significant influence on the dynamic responses of the submerged cylinders liaw and chopra 1974 investigated the dynamic responses of circular cylinders surrounded by water however the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the cylinder in water were replaced by the mode of the cylinder without the surrounding water fig 9 shows the relative displacement responses at the top of the cylinder in the case of mode shapes and in the case of mode shapes and natural frequencies replaced by the mode of the cylinder without the surrounding water it can be seen that the mode shapes in water can be replaced by the mode shapes in a vacuum but the natural frequencies can not be replaced by the natural frequencies in a vacuum this is mainly because the water cylinder interaction has little influence on the fundamental vibration modes of the cylinder while it has a significant influence on the natural frequencies of the cylinder 4 simple model for fluid structure interaction 4 1 free vibration to compute the natural frequencies of a flexible cylinder vibrating in water eq 31 must be solved however it is difficult to do so without using a computer program to avoid this requirement a simple but highly accurate formula will be given based on the fundamental frequency reduction rate of the flexible structure han and xu 1996 yang and li 2013 the added mass concept is introduced here to compute the natural frequencies of the cylinder surrounded by water and a uniform added mass representation is sufficiently accurate the fundamental frequency of a cylinder vibrating in a vacuum is given by the following 38 ω 01 k m where k denotes the stiffness of the cylinder the fundamental frequency of a cylinder vibrating in water is given by the following 39 ω 1 k m c m ρ a 0 where c m is the unknown added mass coefficients a 0 π b 2 if the cylinder is vibrating along the major axis and a 0 π a 2 if the cylinder is vibrating along the minor axis solving for the unknown c m in eq 39 we have 40 c m 1 ω 01 2 ω 1 2 m ρ a 0 the fundamental frequencies ω 01 and ω 1 can be obtained by solving eq 21 and eq 31 respectively table 3 shows the added mass coefficient c m for an elliptical cylinder with the same ratio a b 3 for different e ρ s and h it can be determined that c m only varies with the ratio b h if the cylinder is vibrating along the major axis and only varies with the ratio a h if the cylinder is vibrating along the minor axis it should be noted that an added mass coefficient c m 0 can also be derived by assuming the cylinder is rigid according to eqs 13 and 16 c m 0 is defined by the following 41 c m 0 j 1 2 s j h 2 λ 2 where s j s x j in the case of ground motion along the major axis and s j s y j in the case of ground motion along the minor axis fig 10 shows the ratio of c m to c m 0 against b h and a h in the case of the cylinder vibrating along the direction of the major axis and minor axis with different a b respectively it can be seen that the added mass coefficient c m is smaller than the added mass coefficient c m 0 the relative difference in c m and c m 0 varies with the ratio b h or a h the larger the ratio b h or a h which corresponds to a more squat structure the larger the relative difference is to provide convenience for engineering applications it is extremely necessary to give a simplified formula for the added mass coefficient c m it was determined that the added mass coefficient c m can be well simplified as follows 42a c m c m 0 p 1 e p 2 b h p 3 e p 4 b h vibration in major axis 42b c m c m 0 q 1 e q 2 a h q 3 e q 4 a h vibration in minor axis in which parameters p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 q 1 q 2 q 3 and q 4 are obtained by the curve fitting toolbox in matlab attaway 2013 parameters p 1 p 2 p 3 and p 4 are shown in table 4 and parameters q 1 q 2 q 3 and q 4 are shown in table 5 fig 11 shows the relative error between the exact solution and the simplified formulas it can be seen that the error of the present simplified formulas is less than 10 percent which satisfies the engineering precision demand it should be noted that the simplified formulas for the added mass coefficient c m 0 were presented by wang et al 2018 then the natural frequencies of vibration for an elliptical cylinder surrounded by water can be obtained as follows 43a ω 1 k x η k 2 a 2 h 2 e a ρ s a c m 0 ρ b p 1 e p 2 b h p 3 e p 4 b h 43b ω 1 k y η k 2 b 2 h 2 e b ρ s b c m 0 ρ a q 1 e q 2 a h q 3 e q 4 a h where η k β h is solved by eq 21 such as η 1 1 875 η 2 4 694 and η 3 7 855 ω 1 k x and ω 1 k y denote the natural frequencies in the case of the cylinder vibrating along major axis and minor axis respectively fig 12 shows the relative error for the natural frequencies between the exact solution and the simplified formulas it can be seen that the error of the present simplified formulas is less than 10 percent especially less than 1 percent for the fundamental frequency which satisfies the engineering precision demand it should be noted that the applicable range of the simplified formula proposed in this study is 0 02 b h 2 or 0 02 a h 2 in that range a higher precision can be assured 4 2 forced vibration based on the above discussion in the process of solving the seismic responses of the submerged cylinder the mode shapes of the cylinder in water are replaced by the mode shapes in a vacuum in eqs 35a and 35b and the natural frequencies in water are computed by the simplified formulas in eq 43 correspondingly eqs 35e and 35f are replaced by the following 44e m g i c m g m 0 0 h ϕ i z d z 44f m s i c m s m 0 0 h ϕ i 2 z dz where c m g and c m s are the added mass coefficients corresponding to the rigid motion and flexible motion three schemes for the added mass representation are discussed here namely c m g c m s c m 0 case 1 c m g c m s c m case 2 and c m g c m 0 c m s c m case 3 fig 13 a and b shows the relative displacement responses at the top of the cylinder with b h 0 2 in the case of ground motion along the major axis and with a h 0 5 in the case of ground motion along the minor axis for different cases respectively it can be seen that the responses in case 1 are quite different from the exact solution while the responses in case 2 and case 3 are similar to the exact solution fig 14 shows the peak displacement along the height it can be seen that the peak displacement in case 2 is smaller than the exact solution while the peak displacement in case 3 is slightly greater than the exact solution to ensure the safety of the structures case 2 is recommended for computing the seismic responses of the cylinder surrounded by water 5 conclusions an exact model is developed in this study to compute the responses of a flexible elliptical cylinder vibrating in incompressible water including free vibration responses and seismic responses based on the proposed model and using the fundamental frequency of the cylinder in water and in a vacuum a simple formula for the added mass representation is proposed a simple formula for evaluating the natural frequencies is further proposed by using this added mass representation whose results agree well with the exact solution finally a simple model for evaluating the seismic responses of the submerged cylinder is presented where the mode shapes are replaced by the mode shapes in a vacuum the added mass representation for the rigid motion is obtained by assuming the structure is rigid and the added

22887,an accurate added mass model representation for a flexible elliptical cylinder vibrating in water is presented to accomplish this the analytical expressions for the hydrodynamic forces on elliptical cylinders are first derived in the elliptical coordinate system then explicit expressions for computing the free vibration response of the elliptical cylinder vibrating in water like natural frequencies and mode shapes are given by solving the coupled differential equations the expressions for calculating the forced vibration responses of a flexible cylinder surrounded by water are further given however the expressions of the exact model are too complicated and require the use of computer program to generate the results based on the fundamental frequency reduction rate a simple formula for the added mass representation is proposed to simulate a flexible elliptical cylinder vibrating in water the simple formula for evaluating the natural frequencies and the simple model for evaluating the seismic responses of the submerged cylinder are also presented in the study keywords earthquake fluid structure interaction elliptical cylinder added mass simplified formula 1 introduction the dynamic response behaviour of structures surrounded by water such as intake towers oil storage tanks and bridge piers is influenced by the surrounding water structures located in a seismic region will inevitably suffer from earthquakes in the form of associated hydrodynamic pressures therefore when designing submerged structures it is extremely important to evaluate the changes in the hydrodynamic pressure during earthquakes many researchers have studied the hydrodynamic pressure on submerged structures liaw and chopra 1974 and tanaka and hudspeth 1988 utilized the analytical method and williams 1986 utilized the boundary integral method to calculate the dynamic response of circular cylinders subjected to horizontal ground excitation these results illustrate the decrease in the natural frequencies of the cylinders due to the presence of the surrounding water and the effects of surrounding water hydrodynamic pressure can be conveniently modeled as the product of a hypothetical mass of water and the acceleration of the structure chen 1997 developed a finite difference scheme to solve nonlinear hydrodynamic pressures acting on a rigid circular cylinder during earthquakes it was determined that the hydrodynamic pressure profile increases as the size factor defined as the ratio of diameter of the cylinder to water depth increases liao 1985 and williams 1987 investigated the hydrodynamic interactions between submerged circular cylinders the results indicate that the hydrodynamic interaction is negligible when the relative distance defined as the ratio of the distance between the centers of the cylinders to the sum of the radius of cylinders exceeds 4 while it becomes relevant when the relative distance is less than 2 in addition the earthquake induced hydrodynamic pressure on axisymmetric cylinders was investigated by some researchers such as liaw and chopra 1975 sun and nogami 1991 park et al 1991 and avilés and li 2001 the analytical methods liaw and chopra 1974 tanaka and hudspeth 1988 and numerical methods liaw and chopra 1975 williams 1986 sun and nogami 1991 can be used to accurately simulate the water structure interaction however these methods are not convenient for engineering applications therefore some simplified methods have been developed in recent decades it is already known that when a submerged structure vibrates in incompressible water a part of the water around the structure acts upon it as an added mass currently the value of the added mass that represent the inertia influence of water in contact with a structure is obtained by one of two methods the first method is assuming the structure is rigid and computing an added mass to reproduce the hydrodynamic pressure on the vibrating structure li and yang 2013 du et al 2014 and jiang et al 2017 presented the simplified formulas of the added mass for rigid circular cylinders goyal and chopra 1989 developed a simplified procedure to evaluate the added mass for a rigid intake tower with a two symmetric axes cross section those simplified formulas of the added mass are not only convenient but also sufficiently accurate for practical applications the other method is to obtain the added mass based on the fundamental frequency reduction rate of the flexible structure han and xu 1996 yang and li 2013 han and xu 1996 presented a theoretical model of an added mass representation for a flexible circular cylinder vibrating in water and presented a simple formula for evaluating the natural frequencies using the added mass representation yang and li 2013 calculated the added mass for flexible cylinders with an arbitrary cross section where the fundamental frequency reduction rate was obtained by the finite element method there is excellent agreement with the natural frequencies computed from the analytical model and the simple model han and xu 1996 cylinders with elliptical cross sections are currently under consideration for use as bridge piers offshore oil production and storage facilities compared with circular cylinder the stiffness of the elliptical cylinder along the direction of major and minor axes is different thus the elliptical cylinders can reduce the construction costs when the loads on offshore structures along the direction of major and minor axes are quite different consequently the efficient determination of earthquake induced hydrodynamic pressure on such cylinders has become of considerable practical interest recently wang et al 2018 presented simplified formulas for the added mass for rigid elliptical cylinders however the simple model of an added mass representation for a flexible elliptical cylinder vibrating in water has not been well studied in addition a simple and accurate added mass model for simulating the water cylinder interaction under an earthquake action has not been given in this work a simple added mass model is proposed for the dynamic analysis of flexible elliptical cylinders surrounded by water to accomplish this an exact model for the fluid structure interaction including an elliptical cylinder freely vibrating in water and undergoing forced vibration from seismic loading is proposed based on the analytical solution for the hydrodynamic forces however the expressions of the exact model are too complicated and require the use of a computer program to generate the results therefore a simple model is developed where the added mass representation for the rigid motion is obtained by assuming the structure rigid and the added mass representation for the elastic vibration is obtained by the fundamental frequency reduction rate it should be noted that the estimation of the added mass for simulating the fluid structure interaction in other fields is also important such as the flapping flight see for example the research presented by lefrançois 2017 la mantia and dabnichki 2013 and references therein 2 exact solution for the fluid structure interaction the fluid is assumed to be irrotational incompressible and inviscid a cantilevered elliptical cylinder of semi major a semi minor axes b and submerged in a fluid of constant depth h is subjected to earthquake loading as shown in fig 1 the nomenclature is shown in table 1 the cylinder is assumed to be linearly elastic and it is treated as a one dimensional structure governed by beam theory the bottom of the cylinder is fixed at the rigid ground the water is treated as calm before the action of the earthquake and only the radiation wave is simulated under earthquake according to liaw and chopra 1974 and li and yang 2013 the free surface wave is of little consequence in the earthquake response of towers surrounded by water therefore free surface waves are assumed to not be generated in this study 2 1 solutions for hydrodynamic forces a harmonic wave with frequency ω is considered here as the seismic excitation the ground motion can be expressed as u g t u g e i ω t and the displacement of the cylinder relative to the ground motion can be expressed as u t u e i ω t where t is time and u g and u are the displacement of the ground and the deformation of the cylinder in the frequency domain respectively based on the elliptical coordinate system wang et al 2018 derived the analytical solution of the hydrodynamic forces on a rigid elliptical cylinder surrounded by water subjected to earthquake loading the expressions of the hydrodynamic forces on a flexible elliptical cylinder surrounded by water will be deduced using the same method the elliptic coordinate system is depicted in fig 2 the governing equation in the fluid domain is the laplace equation which in an elliptical coordinate system ξ η z is 1 2 μ 2 cosh 2 ξ cos 2 η

satisfied are as follows 1 no vertical motion at the boundary z 0 i e 3 p z z 0 0 2 the hydrodynamic pressure at the free surface of the water is zero as follows 4 p z h 0 3 in the case of ground motion in the direction of the major axis of the elliptical cylinder the symmetry conditions about the η 0 plan are given by the following 5a p η η 0 0 5b p η 0 5 π 0 in the case of the ground motion in the direction of the minor axis of an elliptical cylinder the symmetry conditions about the η 0 5π plan are given by the follows 6a p η η 0 5 π 0 6b p η 0 0 4 the pressure waves propagate away from the structure and decay with the travelling distance so the hydrodynamic pressure at infinity is zero as follows 7 p ξ 0 5 in the case of ground motion in the direction of the major axis of elliptical cylinder p should satisfy the following 8 p ξ ξ ξ 0 ρ 2 u s 2 t b cos η and in the case of ground motion in the direction of the minor axis of elliptical cylinder p should satisfy the following 9 p ξ ξ ξ 0 ρ 2 u s 2 t a sin η where ρ is the mass density of the fluid u s u g u for forced vibration analysis and u s u for free vibration analysis using the method of separation of variables and the

elliptical cylinder along the major axis in the time domain can be obtained by the following 12 f x 0 2 π p 1 ξ ξ 0 b cos η d η substituting eq 10 into eq 12 after some manipulations the resultant expression is as follows 13 f x 2 ρ π b 2 h j 1 u j s x j cos λ z 14 s x j a 1 1 2 k e 1 ξ 0 q k e 1 ξ 0 q the hydrodynamic force on different locations of the elliptical cylinder along the minor axis in time domain can be obtained by the following 15 f y 0 2 π p 2 ξ ξ 0 a sin η d η substituting eq 11 into eq 15 and after some manipulations the resultant expression is as follows 16 f y 2 ρ π a 2 h

in water ϕ can be expanded to the expressions of the mode shapes in a vacuum which can be expressed as follows 19 ϕ i d i ϕ i where ϕ i are the mode shapes in a vacuum and d i are the expansion coefficients the mode shapes in a vacuum ϕ i is represented by the following 20 ϕ i z sin β z sinh β z sin β h sinh β h cos β h cosh β h cosh β z cos β z where β can be solved by the frequency equation in eq 21 as follows 21 1 cosh β h cos β h 0 then the natural frequencies of the cantilever beam in a vacuum ω 0 i can be obtained by ω 0 i β 2 e i m the mode shapes and natural frequencies in a vacuum should satisfy the following 22 e i d 4 ϕ d z 4 ω 0 i 2 m ϕ 0 substituting eqs 19 and 20 into eq 18 after some manipulations the resultant expression is as follows 23 i ω 0 i 2 ω 2 m ϕ i d i

natural frequencies of circular cylinders in water are compared with those in a previous study han and xu 1996 where e 29 4 gpa ρ s 2450 kg m3 and h 20 m the natural frequencies and the difference between the two studies are tabulated in table 2 it is seen that good agreements are observed 2 3 forced vibration it is assumed that the cylinder can only be distorted in the first n mode shapes of vibration in a vacuum liaw and chopra 1974 therefore the elastic displacement of the cylinder under an earthquake action in the time domain can be written as follows 33 u i 1 n ϕ i z χ i t where ϕ i z are the mode shapes in a vacuum and χ i t are generalized coordinates employing the superposition method of mode of vibration and using the orthogonality of the mode shapes in water the equation of motion for the response of the cylinder to horizontal ground motion is expressed as follows 34 m i χ i c i χ i k i χ i m 0 i u g m g i u g m s i χ i the generalized properties denoted in this equation

seismic loading then the generalized modal displacement χ i t can be obtained by the following 37 χ i t 1 2 π q i ω e i ω t d ω 3 examples in order to investigate the effects of the surrounding water on the dynamic properties and dynamic responses of elliptical cylinders the free and forced vibration responses of a flexible cylinder fully submerged in water are studied and compared with the results of vibration in a vacuum 3 1 free vibration response the free vibration responses of an elliptical cylinder vibrating in water and in a vacuum are performed using the following data ρ 1000 kg m3 ρ s 2500 kg m3 e 30000 mpa and h 40m the first three frequencies of free vibration are computed from eq 31 fig 3 a and b shows the fundamental frequency reduction rate τ against b h and a h in the case of the cylinder vibrating along the direction of the major axis and minor axis with different a b respectively where τ is defined as τ ω 0 ω i ω 0 it can be seen that a cylinder vibrates at a slower frequency in water than in a vacuum and the relative difference in frequencies decreases as the ratio b h or a h increases which is mainly because the added mass per unit length decreases as the ratio b h or a h increases wang et al 2018 it can also be seen that the fundamental frequency reduction rate τ decreases as the ratio a b increases in the case of the cylinder vibrating along the major axis while it increases as the ratio a b increases in the case of the cylinder vibrating along the minor axis this phenomenon is mainly caused by the fact that the added mass per unit length decreases as the ratio a b increases in the case of the cylinder vibrating along the major axis while it increases as the ratio a b increases in the case of the cylinder vibrating along the minor axis wang et al 2018 fig 4 a and b shows the frequency reduction rate τ for the first three modes against b h and a h in the case of the cylinder vibrating along the major axis and minor axis with a b 2 respectively the results indicate that fluid structure interaction has a greater influence on the second natural frequencies than the first and third natural frequencies figs 5 and 6 show the first three modes in the case of a cylinder b h 0 2 vibrating along the direction of the major axis and in the case of the cylinder a h 0 5 vibrating along the direction of the minor axis with a b 3 respectively it can be seen that the fundamental vibration modes in water and in a vacuum are identical while for the higher modes their differences become more obvious especially in the case of a cylinder vibrating along the minor axis this phenomenon may be because that the displacement of the cylinder in the first modes increases from the base to the top 3 2 forced vibration response the forced vibration response of an elliptical cylinder vibrating in water and in a vacuum are performed using the following data h 40m a b 3 and ζ i 0 02 the displacement time histories of the ground motion are shown in fig 7 fig 8 a and b shows the relative displacement responses at the top of the cylinder with b h 0 2 in the case of ground motion along the major axis and with a h 0 5 in the case of ground motion along the minor axis it can be seen that the fluid structure interaction has a significant influence on the dynamic responses of the submerged cylinders liaw and chopra 1974 investigated the dynamic responses of circular cylinders surrounded by water however the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the cylinder in water were replaced by the mode of the cylinder without the surrounding water fig 9 shows the relative displacement responses at the top of the cylinder in the case of mode shapes and in the case of mode shapes and natural frequencies replaced by the mode of the cylinder without the surrounding water it can be seen that the mode shapes in water can be replaced by the mode shapes in a vacuum but the natural frequencies can not be replaced by the natural frequencies in a vacuum this is mainly because the water cylinder interaction has little influence on the fundamental vibration modes of the cylinder while it has a significant influence on the natural frequencies of the cylinder 4 simple model for fluid structure interaction 4 1 free vibration to compute the natural frequencies of a flexible cylinder vibrating in water eq 31 must be solved however it is difficult to do so without using a computer program to avoid this requirement a simple but highly accurate formula will be given based on the fundamental frequency reduction rate of the flexible structure han and xu 1996 yang and li 2013 the added mass concept is introduced here to compute the natural frequencies of the cylinder surrounded by water and a uniform added mass representation is sufficiently accurate the fundamental frequency of a cylinder vibrating in a vacuum is given by the following 38 ω 01 k m where k denotes the stiffness of the cylinder the fundamental frequency of a cylinder vibrating in water is given by the following 39 ω 1 k m c m ρ a 0 where c m is the unknown added mass coefficients a 0 π b 2 if the cylinder is vibrating along the major axis and a 0 π a 2 if the cylinder is vibrating along the minor axis solving for the unknown c m in eq 39 we have 40 c m 1 ω 01 2 ω 1 2 m ρ a 0 the fundamental frequencies ω 01 and ω 1 can be obtained by solving eq 21 and eq 31 respectively table 3 shows the added mass coefficient c m for an elliptical cylinder with the same ratio a b 3 for different e ρ s and h it can be determined that c m only varies with the ratio b h if the cylinder is vibrating along the major axis and only varies with the ratio a h if the cylinder is vibrating along the minor axis it should be noted that an added mass coefficient c m 0 can also be derived by assuming the cylinder is rigid according to eqs 13 and 16 c m 0 is defined by the following 41 c m 0 j 1 2 s j h 2 λ 2 where s j s x j in the case of ground motion along the major axis and s j s y j in the case of ground motion along the minor axis fig 10 shows the ratio of c m to c m 0 against b h and a h in the case of the cylinder vibrating along the direction of the major axis and minor axis with different a b respectively it can be seen that the added mass coefficient c m is smaller than the added mass coefficient c m 0 the relative difference in c m and c m 0 varies with the ratio b h or a h the larger the ratio b h or a h which corresponds to a more squat structure the larger the relative difference is to provide convenience for engineering applications it is extremely necessary to give a simplified formula for the added mass coefficient c m it was determined that the added mass coefficient c m can be well simplified as follows 42a c m c m 0 p 1 e p 2 b h p 3 e p 4 b h vibration in major axis 42b c m c m 0 q 1 e q 2 a h q 3 e q 4 a h vibration in minor axis in which parameters p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 q 1 q 2 q 3 and q 4 are obtained by the curve fitting toolbox in matlab attaway 2013 parameters p 1 p 2 p 3 and p 4 are shown in table 4 and parameters q 1 q 2 q 3 and q 4 are shown in table 5 fig 11 shows the relative error between the exact solution and the simplified formulas it can be seen that the error of the present simplified formulas is less than 10 percent which satisfies the engineering precision demand it should be noted that the simplified formulas for the added mass coefficient c m 0 were presented by wang et al 2018 then the natural frequencies of vibration for an elliptical cylinder surrounded by water can be obtained as follows 43a ω 1 k x η k 2 a 2 h 2 e a ρ s a c m 0 ρ b p 1 e p 2 b h p 3 e p 4 b h 43b ω 1 k y η k 2 b 2 h 2 e b ρ s b c m 0 ρ a q 1 e q 2 a h q 3 e q 4 a h where η k β h is solved by eq 21 such as η 1 1 875 η 2 4 694 and η 3 7 855 ω 1 k x and ω 1 k y denote the natural frequencies in the case of the cylinder vibrating along major axis and minor axis respectively fig 12 shows the relative error for the natural frequencies between the exact solution and the simplified formulas it can be seen that the error of the present simplified formulas is less than 10 percent especially less than 1 percent for the fundamental frequency which satisfies the engineering precision demand it should be noted that the applicable range of the simplified formula proposed in this study is 0 02 b h 2 or 0 02 a h 2 in that range a higher precision can be assured 4 2 forced vibration based on the above discussion in the process of solving the seismic responses of the submerged cylinder the mode shapes of the cylinder in water are replaced by the mode shapes in a vacuum in eqs 35a and 35b and the natural frequencies in water are computed by the simplified formulas in eq 43 correspondingly eqs 35e and 35f are replaced by the following 44e m g i c m g m 0 0 h ϕ i z d z 44f m s i c m s m 0 0 h ϕ i 2 z dz where c m g and c m s are the added mass coefficients corresponding to the rigid motion and flexible motion three schemes for the added mass representation are discussed here namely c m g c m s c m 0 case 1 c m g c m s c m case 2 and c m g c m 0 c m s c m case 3 fig 13 a and b shows the relative displacement responses at the top of the cylinder with b h 0 2 in the case of ground motion along the major axis and with a h 0 5 in the case of ground motion along the minor axis for different cases respectively it can be seen that the responses in case 1 are quite different from the exact solution while the responses in case 2 and case 3 are similar to the exact solution fig 14 shows the peak displacement along the height it can be seen that the peak displacement in case 2 is smaller than the exact solution while the peak displacement in case 3 is slightly greater than the exact solution to ensure the safety of the structures case 2 is recommended for computing the seismic responses of the cylinder surrounded by water 5 conclusions an exact model is developed in this study to compute the responses of a flexible elliptical cylinder vibrating in incompressible water including free vibration responses and seismic responses based on the proposed model and using the fundamental frequency of the cylinder in water and in a vacuum a simple formula for the added mass representation is proposed a simple formula for evaluating the natural frequencies is further proposed by using this added mass representation whose results agree well with the exact solution finally a simple model for evaluating the seismic responses of the submerged cylinder is presented where the mode shapes are replaced by the mode shapes in a vacuum the added mass representation for the rigid motion is obtained by assuming the structure is rigid and the added mass representation for the elastic vibration is obtained by the fundamental frequency reduction rate acknowledgements this work was jointly funded by national natural science foundation of china

22888,introduction of the energy efficiency design index eedi raised concerns that ship designers may simply reduce the installed power to satisfy eedi requirements to address the problem by in depth research eu funded project shopera energy efficient safe ship operation developed criteria and acceptance standards for the assessment of sufficiency of propulsion and steering systems of ships for manoeuvrability in adverse conditions here their impact on ships of all types in the eedi framework is investigated and compared with the statistics of relevant accidents collected in shopera the comparison shows that the proposed standards seem appropriate for tankers roro cargo vessels pure car carriers and gas carriers whereas for small bulk carriers and small general cargo vessels stricter standards may be needed if the same safety level is targeted for small ships as for large ones the results also show that ships of almost all types studied can satisfy the proposed standards together with the eedi phase 3 requirements excepting bulk carriers and tankers which can satisfy the proposed standards and eedi phase 2 requirements but not those of phase 3 for roro passenger ships satisfying the eedi phase 3 requirements alone may be problematic because of other limitations concerning design and operation keywords manoeuvrability in adverse conditions eedi criteria standards case studies 1 introduction introduction of the energy efficiency design index eedi to improve energy efficiency of shipping and reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions has raised concerns that ship designers may simply reduce the installed power to satisfy eedi requirements this can lead to insufficient propulsion and steering abilities of ships to manoeuvre under adverse weather conditions this concern initiated studies by the international association of classification societies iacs which led to the 2012 interim guidelines for determining minimum propulsion power to maintain the manoeuvrability of ships in adverse conditions imo 2012 revised in 2013 imo 2013 and updated by resolutions imo 2014 imo 2015 to support the development of regulations concerning manoeuvrability in adverse conditions by in depth research several research projects were initiated world wide among them the eu funded project shopera energy efficient safe ship operation www shopera org 2013 2016 imo 2016 representing the whole spectrum of the european maritime industry classification societies universities research organisations ship designers shipyards and ship operators the project developed criteria for the assessment of sufficiency of propulsion and steering systems of ships for manoeuvrability in adverse conditions adapted and validated hydrodynamic methods for analysis of seakeeping and manoeuvring performance of ships in complex environmental conditions integrated these tools into a ship design software platform combined with a multi objective optimization procedure and ultimately contributed to the development of updated requirements to the propulsion and steering abilities of ships for sufficient manoeuvrability in adverse conditions imo 2016 this paper investigates the impact of the proposed requirements on design and operational characteristics of various ship types the following terminology is used here the term criterion refers to a characteristic of the ship such as ability to turn keep course weather vane etc relevant for the considered problem the corresponding measure e g turning diameter or overshoot angle quantifies numerically the ship s performance with respect to the respective criterion for the manoeuvrability in adverse conditions a convenient and popular measure is the marginal i e maximum weather severity specified by wave height and wind speed up to which the ship can fulfil the criterion change or keep course weather vane etc the term standard refers to the acceptance limit for a measure to consider the ship as fulfilling the defined criterion here the standard is the prescribed significant wave height and the related wind force at which the ship should be able to fulfil the corresponding criterion shopera considered three scenarios of adverse conditions in which manoeuvrability of ships is challenged in different ways and which require therefore specific criteria manoeuvring in the open sea in coastal waters and in restricted areas at limited speed shigunov and papanikolaou 2015 the open sea scenario imposes less strict requirements on the manoeuvring it is sufficient that the ship can weather vane i e change heading into a favourable one with respect to the environment and keep this heading this leads to the following practical weather vaning criterion the ship should be able to keep heading in head to bow quartering seaway up to 60 off bow the second scenario manoeuvring in coastal waters imposes stronger functional requirements on ship s manoeuvrability in principle any manoeuvre may be required sometimes in complex navigational situations and in seaway directions unfavourable for manoeuvring however the environmental conditions are less severe than in the open sea because in an increasing storm ship masters timely search for shelter or leave to the open sea therefore this scenario requires both a sufficient steering ability to avoid grounding collision or contact and a sufficient propulsion ability to enable timely leaving coastal area both are required in any seaway direction correspondingly two practical criteria were proposed for coastal areas steering ability the ship s ability to perform any manoeuvre in seaway from any direction and propulsion ability the ship s ability to maintain 6 knots speed in seaway from any direction because the ability of the ship to perform any manoeuvre is impossible to evaluate in practice a practical easy to evaluate steering ability criterion was proposed that the ship should be able to overcome environmental forces to start or continue course change in seaway from any direction note that the required speed in the propulsion ability criterion was increased from 4 knots in 2013 interim guidelines to 6 knots to consider possibly strong currents in coastal areas the third scenario manoeuvrability at limited speed in restricted areas concerns situations where the ship master must reduce the applied engine power and forward speed significantly below the available power because of navigational restrictions e g during approaching to or entering ports or navigation in channels and rivers as practical criterion course keeping at a specified low speed in strong wind in shallow water in shallow water near a bank and in shallow water during overtaking by a quicker ship were proposed this criterion was found relevant for majority of manoeuvrability related accidents in adverse weather conditions for roro ropax cruise and container ships ventikos et al 2015 however since full power is not applied in this scenario the corresponding criteria will not impose any restrictions on the minimum installed power or conflict with eedi requirements therefore this scenario is not considered the developed criteria once accepted need to be applied to all vessels subject to eedi regulations whereas the compliance with the imo manoeuvrability standards imo 2002 is demonstrated in full scale trials this is impossible for the assessment of ship manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions a practical assessment procedure developed by shopera and referred to as comprehensive assessment shigunov 2017 is based on separate evaluation of different acting forces and moments due to waves wind propeller rudder etc from simple model tests numerical simulations or empirical formulae and combination of these contributions in a simple numerical model shigunov 2017 whereas such assessment may be required for cases with large uncertainties such as innovative propulsion and steering solutions simpler assessment procedures are also required which can be used for the majority of ships however the simplifications must be compensated by some safety margins which makes such simplified procedures more conservative than the comprehensive assessment still they are sufficiently accurate for most conventional vessels can be employed by designers already in early design stage and can be routinely used by administrations shopera developed a procedure of complexity of a spreadsheet calculation called simplified assessment description will be published elsewhere which considers the physics of the problem but uses a reduced number of assessment situations and reduced complexity of motion equations while still allowing free choice between experimental numerical or empirical methods to evaluate different input elements to evaluate the manoeuvrability criteria the brake power required to satisfy a criterion is compared with the available brake power whereas the former is the result of the assessment procedure the latter depends on the characteristics of the main engine which should be provided by the engine manufacturer including engine specific limits under high load the paper summarizes the relevant data used for the definition of standards and proposes an approach to quantitatively fine tune the standards in section 2 following this approach the standards are determined by the application of criteria for manoeuvrability in adverse conditions to all ship types and sizes in the eedi framework in section 3 in section 4 the standards are verified by their comparison with accident statistics section 5 studies feasibility of the simultaneous satisfaction of the requirements to manoeuvrability in adverse conditions and eedi requirements 2 approach to defining standards with an increasing wave height the brake power p b required to fulfil the weather vaning ability steering ability or propulsion ability criterion will increase at some wave height referred to as the marginal wave height this power will achieve the available brake power p b av so that the ship will not be able to fulfil the considered criterion if the wave height is further increased to differentiate between sufficiently and insufficiently safe ships the acceptance limit standard needs to be established for the marginal wave height in shopera several sources were used to estimate the relevant values for the standards observations of wind and waves in the open sea and coastal areas relevant regulations interviews of ship masters detailed accident investigations as well as statistics of accidents due to insufficient manoeuvrability in adverse conditions including accident rates locations and corresponding environmental conditions it is not feasible and not necessary to design ships for manoeuvring in the worst possible storms that can be theoretically encountered when considering ship s economy and the fact that ships unable to manoeuvre in the open sea may drift for a limited time without risk for safety whereas in the coastal areas ships timely escape dangerous areas or search for a shelter before the storm escalates the relevant data concerning statistics of the weather conditions during ship collisions from the harmonisation of rules and design rationale harder project indicate that more than 80 of the collisions happened at significant wave height below 2 m whereas significant wave heights exceeding 4 m were practically not recorded paper imo 2010 collected requirements of classification societies related to the redundancy or duplication of the propulsion system to define criteria and environmental conditions relevant for steering and propulsion in adverse weather indicates rather mild standard weather conditions wind speed up to 21 m s and significant wave height up to 5 4 m for weather vaning and wind force up to bft 8 for 6 0 knots advance speed requirement for the scenario of increasing storm in coastal waters the 2013 interim guidelines imo 2013 imo 2014 imo 2015 defined the standards by benchmarking of tankers bulk carriers and container ships in the eedi database with respect to course keeping and advance speed criteria this led to the significant wave height 4 0 m and wind speed 15 7 m s for ships with l pp 200 m and less and significant wave height 5 5 m and wind speed 19 0 m s for l pp 250 m and greater with a linear interpolation of wave height and wind speed for l pp between 200 m and 250 m a summary of accident investigation reports in shigunov 2017 see also references therein indicates that the most frequent cause of heavy weather related grounding accidents is long waiting at anchor until it starts dragging and starting the engine too late or at a too low rate to avoid grounding in several accidents however vessels were not able to move away from the coast or turn into waves and wind despite full engine power applied the reports indicate wind force up to bft 10 more than 23 m s and significant wave heights above 6 0 m during accidents in coastal areas however in the well documented case n n 2008 where the significant wave height exceeded 6 0 m too long waiting of the vessel at anchor in an increasing storm was found as one of the main reasons of the accident the study of this accident in shigunov 2017 shows that at the significant wave height of 4 5 m about 80 of the initial number of vessels were still at anchor whereas 50 of the vessels left anchorage before significant wave height achieved about 5 5 m and 80 of the vessels have left to the open sea before the significant wave height achieved 6 0 m fig 1 the two vessels remained at anchor after that underwent a grounding and a near grounding accidents the conducted interviews of the masters of about 50 container ships bulk carriers and tankers concerning ship characteristics and environmental conditions relevant for manoeuvrability in heavy weather shigunov 2017 indicate that in the open sea the captain usually has more freedom and can decide what severity of weather conditions is acceptable depending on the freeboard cargo stability and propulsion and steering characteristics of the vessel even when caught in violent storms where steering against seaway may be impossible for any vessel drifting with seaway can be an option for a limited time however power matters in coastal areas when it is necessary to escape the storm and bring the ship into safe weather conditions in coastal areas the relevant environmental conditions are less severe because ship masters do not remain near the coast in a growing storm but either search for shelter or leave to the open sea 50 of the ship masters leave coastal areas before wind force achieves bft 8 and significant wave height achieves 5 0 m up to wave height of 6 m 80 of ships leave coastal areas however some ship masters reported wind force up to bft 10 and significant wave height up to 11 m as relevant for manoeuvrability problems shopera carried out an analysis of statistics of the accidents related to insufficient manoeuvrability in adverse conditions ventikos et al 2015 the calculated accident rates are in the range of 10 5 to 10 3 accidents per ship per year table 1 i e by one order of magnitude less than accident rates found in formal safety assessments which do not consider the prevailing weather conditions the most vulnerable ship types with respect to navigational accidents in adverse conditions are general cargo ships followed by ro ro ships cruise ships and bulk carriers table 1 factors increasing accident frequency are frequent port calls general cargo vessels roro ferries and large windage area cruise and roro vessels car carriers among the three navigational accident types groundings have the highest rates for cargo carrying ships in general whereas ro ro ships show the highest rates of contacts the accident locations vary between port areas dominating location for ro ro ferries roro cargo cruise and general cargo vessels and bulk carriers generally restricted waters significant contribution for general cargo vessels and bulk carriers and less frequently open sea en route conditions a significant contribution for general cargo vessels tankers and bulk carriers while very insignificant for other vessel types fig 2 important result is that including very rare abnormal weather events hurricanes typhoons etc in statistical analysis does not significantly alter the statistics majority of manoeuvrability related accidents happen in coastal areas observed significant wave height and wind speed average over all accidents are remarkably low 1 49 m and 10 m s respectively on the other hand maximum significant wave heights and wind speeds during few manoeuvrability related accidents can achieve up to 7 0 m and 20 m s respectively there is a statistically significant difference in mean wave height between ship types which means that some ship types are more affected by adverse weather scenarios than the others the largest wave heights during accidents are observed for roro ferries bulk carriers and cruise vessels and lowest for gas carriers in general the collected evidence shows significant scatter in the environmental conditions relevant for manoeuvrability from 1 5 to 2 0 m according to accident statistics in ventikos et al 2015 to 4 0 5 5 m according to redundancy requirements imo 2010 2013 interim guidelines imo 2013 imo 2014 imo 2015 interviews of ship masters and investigations of individual accidents although some cases indicate greater wave heights according to individual accident investigations and few interviews such cases were usually a result of human error and led to serious accidents i e they cannot be considered as typical operational practices whereas the above results are useful to estimate the relevant severity of environmental conditions exact definition of standards requires a more quantitative approach the most rational way to fine tune the standards is to benchmark the existing fleet with respect to the new criteria because the accident statistics ventikos et al 2015 show that the present safety level with respect to manoeuvrability related accidents in heavy weather is in general satisfactory a reasonable percentage of existing vessels should be able to satisfy the proposed standards note further in favour of such benchmarking that ship s manoeuvrability especially manoeuvrability in adverse conditions depends more than other ship s characteristics on the operational practices because operational practices cannot be changed abruptly e g due to the introduction of eedi calibration of design safety requirements with respect to the existing operating ships is a suitable solution note also that whereas the proposed manoeuvrability criteria address relevant characteristics of the ship its engine and propulsion and steering systems they are significantly simplified to remain practicable and thus the definition of standards should be considered as fine tuning of the assessment to reliably differentiate between sufficiently and insufficiently safe ships therefore dedicated case studies concerning all ship types covered by eedi regulations were conducted to define standards their adequacy was further verified by comparison with the accident statistics of the fleet in service as a function of ship type and size note that in addition to the wave height relevant wind speed wave period and wave energy spectrum should be defined following recommendations in imo 2016 and shigunov 2018 for the relevant environmental conditions for the assessment of propulsion ability and steering ability in coastal areas wind speed was assumed as v w 9 h s 0 44 m s peak wave period was varied from 3 6 h s 0 5 to the lower value of 5 0 h s 0 5 and 12 s and jonswap wave energy spectrum was used with the peak parameter 3 3 and cos2 angular wave energy spreading 3 definition of standards 3 1 selection of representative ships the case studies concerned bulk carriers tankers general cargo vessels container ships lng carriers gas carriers reefers roro cargo vessels ropax vessels and cruise vessels defined according to marpol annex iv chapter 1 regulation 2 imo 2011 and selected within the whole range of representative sizes because the installed power may differ significantly between ships of the same type and size to provide a rational basis for the definition of standards several series of ships consisting of ships of all sizes were selected along the lines in axes installed power mcr length between perpendiculars l pp each of these series cuts a certain percentage 5 10 20 30 etc of vessels of lower power at each size in addition four series of ships consisting of ships of all sizes were selected in such a way that ships in each series marginally fulfil the requirements of a certain phase of eedi implementation phase 0 1 2 and 3 finally a series of bulk carriers and tankers was selected for comparison along the minimum power lines mpl imo 2013 imo 2014 imo 2015 the examples of these series for bulk carriers are shown in fig 3 fig 4 shows series of container ships and general cargo vessels used for comparison covering the relevant range of ship sizes and including vessels along the low power boundaries of their ihs fairplay databases n n 2016 circled 3 2 assessment results for representative ships for the selected series of ships marginal wave heights with respect to the steering ability and propulsion ability criteria were defined using the comprehensive assessment fig 5 shows the marginal significant wave heights for the propulsion ability left and steering ability right criteria for bulk carriers and tankers with the installed power cutting 5 of low power vessels of their fairplay databases together with results for low power container ships and general cargo vessels the marginal wave heights for bulk carriers and tankers are very similar and lie significantly below those for container ships general cargo vessels have marginal wave heights comparable to bulk carriers and tankers or significantly greater depending on design one observation from these results is that the marginal wave heights depend on ship size larger vessels can satisfy the proposed criteria at greater wave heights than smaller vessels this follows from the physics of the problem however whether the standards should be ship size dependent is a subject for discussion with interested stakeholders in favour of ship size dependent standards note first that this dependency follows from the application of manoeuvrability criteria to existing vessels and thus reflects real existing design and operation practices and second that the consequences of accidents are generally greater for larger vessels thus the safety standards for them may need to be stricter these results as well as the results presented below also show that the marginal wave heights differ sometimes substantially between different ship types marginal wave heights of bulk carriers and tankers are lower than those of the other vessel types due to their bigger block coefficients and lower installed power per displacement compared to vessels of the same size of other types reaching a conclusion on ship type dependency of standards also requires a discussion with interested stakeholders the arguments in favour of ship type dependent standards are first that the differences in the marginal wave heights between different ship types result from the application of manoeuvrability criteria to existing vessels thus they reflect established design and operational practices and second that the consequences of accidents differ sometimes significantly between different ship types especially between passenger and cargo vessels on the other hand the differences in the manoeuvrability characteristics in adverse conditions reflect at least partially differences in the economic performance profiles of various ship types which should not affect the minimum required safety level this is evident when comparing e g the operational profile of ropax ships with that of slow steaming tankers and bulk carriers marginal wave heights for bulk carriers and tankers with the installed power cutting 10 and 20 of low power vessels of their fairplay databases are shown in fig 6 for vessels marginally satisfying the requirements of eedi implementation phases 1 2 and 3 in fig 7 and for vessels on mpl of 2013 interim guidelines imo 2013 imo 2014 imo 2015 in fig 8 3 3 proposals of standards in imo 2016 the following standard wave heights were proposed h s min 2 2 l pp 75 5 5 for the propulsion ability assessment and h s 2 0 l pp 100 for the steering ability assessment the standard wave height proposed for the propulsion ability assessment was based on the lowest marginal wave heights over the considered ship types i e on the marginal wave heights for bulk carriers and tankers and on the requirement that the standard should be equal to the standard wave height of 5 5 m from the 2013 interim guidelines for vessels with l pp 250 m and for other ship sizes cut approximately the same percentage of low power vessels as for vessels with l pp 250 m the level off of the standard at h s 5 5 m for l pp 250 m similarly to 2013 interim guidelines follows from the observation that largest ships involved in accidents are significantly smaller than average ships in service of the same type ventikos et al 2015 especially for container ships tankers and general cargo ships because they are less sensitive to adverse weather conditions have less frequent port calls compared to smaller ships and because they usually call for tug assistance when approaching port or navigating in restricted waters to define the standard wave height for the steering ability assessment in imo 2016 it was assumed that on the average the same percentage of vessels of each size should fail the steering ability requirement as the propulsion ability requirement because the steering ability criterion is stricter than the propulsion ability criterion the marginal wave heights are lower another way to define standards is to remember that according to the statistics of manoeuvrability related accidents in adverse weather conditions ventikos et al 2015 existing ships are in general sufficiently safe in this respect therefore ships of different types and sizes selected in axes l pp installed power along the lines cutting 5 or 10 of low power vessels of their fairplay databases can be assumed representative of existing low power vessels figs 5 and 6 however the 5 boundary may be influenced by wrong reporting in the ihs fairplay databases therefore the 10 low power boundary seems more suitable for bulk carriers and tankers along this boundary the marginal significant wave height can be approximated for propulsion ability criterion as h s min 4 5 l pp 170 70 6 0 and for steering ability criterion as h s 3 5 l pp 170 105 note that these approximations are valid only for bulk carriers and tankers with l pp 150 m table 2 and fig 9 summarise the proposals for standards 3 4 correlation between and redundancy of criteria another question investigated in the case studies was the possibility of redundancy of criteria the weather vaning ability criterion was treated in a simplified way as the ability of the ship to keep position in bow to bow quartering seaway this simplification follows from the observation that the ship with the traditional steering devices at the stern will not be able to keep heading under the action of environmental forces if the forward speed is not sufficiently large because of significantly reduced manoeuvring reactions on the hull and steering force on the rudder fig 10 left compares marginal significant wave heights for the propulsion ability x axis and weather vaning ability y axis criteria for the selected ships the latter are consistently greater than the former note also that the marginal wave heights according to these criteria are very well correlated which means that one of these criteria is sufficient the right hand side plot compares marginal wave heights according to propulsion ability x axis and steering ability y axis criteria these are also correlated to some degree however with significantly more spreading than for the position keeping ability vs propulsion ability up to the significant wave height of about 5 5 m the difference in the marginal wave heights between these two criteria does not exceed 1 0 m and the difference does not exceed 1 5 m up to significant wave height of about 8 5 m see the dash dot dot line which is 1 0 m below the bisect for significant wave heights up to 4 0 m and 1 5 m below the bisect for significant wave heights above 5 5 m these results mean that fulfilling propulsion ability criterion at some significant wave height means fulfilment of steering ability criterion at lower wave heights by 1 0 m for l pp 200 0 m to 1 5 m l pp 250 0 m for the sample this correlation is however not automatic and occurred because the selected ships have a properly sized rudder further it was investigated whether the imo manoeuvrability standards can ensure such a sufficient correlation between the marginal wave heights for propulsion ability and steering ability criteria for the well known benchmark tanker kvlcc2 the minimum required rudder area to fulfil the turning ability initial turning ability and yaw checking and course keeping abilities was found to be 67 0 83 4 and 116 2 m2 respectively when the largest area of these was employed the difference in marginal wave heights between propulsion ability and steering ability criteria was less than 1 5 m i e for this ship the fulfilment of the propulsion ability criterion together with the imo manoeuvrability standards ensures a sufficient correlation more case studies are needed to verify this conclusion for other ship types and sizes it was also investigated whether the imo manoeuvrability standards can make also the propulsion ability criterion redundant in which case assessment of manoeuvrability in waves is in principle not necessary the standard manoeuvres according to the imo manoeuvrability standards were simulated to check this suggestion the installed power was varied for kvlcc2 the results show that the installed power has very weak influence on the turning circle and the overshoot angles of 10 10 and 20 20 zig zag manoeuvres thus the imo manoeuvrability standards cannot make the propulsion ability criterion redundant 4 verification of standards 4 1 approach the adequacy of the proposed standards was evaluated by their comparison with the safety level of fleet in service for different ship types and sizes using accident statistics ventikos et al 2015 note that there were no relevant accidents recorded for refrigerated cargo carriers and lng carriers therefore the assessment results for these ship types are not included in this paper the study concerned bulk carriers tankers general cargo vessels container ships lng and gas carriers reefers roro cargo vessels ropax vessels and cruise vessels defined according to marpol annex iv ch 1 reg 2 imo 2011 and selected within the whole range of representative sizes and installed power values in addition to the series of designs used above to define standards 4 2 bulk carriers for bulk carriers fig 11 shows installed mcr required to satisfy different standards vs deadweight left and lpp right the standards include the minimum power lines mpl of 2013 interim guidelines denoted as mpl minimum mcr required to satisfy the propulsion ability 1 and steering ability 2 requirements with the standard proposed in imo 2016 shopera p and shopera s respectively minimum mcr required to satisfy the propulsion ability criterion with the standard wave height and wind speed according to 2013 interim guidelines 2013 ig and minimum mcr required to satisfy the propulsion ability and steering ability requirements with the standards based on 10 low power ships cut off 10 p and 10 s together with the ihs fairplay database fair play and the average values of mcr l pp and deadweight from the accident database ventikos et al 2015 accidents the vertical lines in the left hand side plot indicate size classes small deadweight below 10000 t handysize 10000 40000 t handymax 40000 65000 t panamax 65000 100000 t and capesize above 100000 t the vertical lines in the right hand side plot correspond to l pp of 200 and 250 m differentiating standards in 2013 interim guidelines according to the accident statistics bulk carriers have a rather high frequency of accidents 17 of relevant accidents over all ship types per year third after general cargo vessels and roro partly because of the very large fleet at risk in terms of the number of accidents per ship per year however bulk carriers are only on the fifth place after general cargo roro and cruise vessels and pure car carriers about half of all accidents happened in port and the other half is distributed between restricted and open waters this together with the fact that bulk carriers involved in accidents are on the average significantly smaller than fleet in service suggests that part of accidents may happen due to insufficient power for manoeuvring in adverse conditions the highest frequency of accidents is observed for handysize handymax and panamax size classes no relevant accidents were found for capesize bulk carriers numerical analysis shows that the average mcr of handysize and handymax size bulk carriers from the accident database exceeds the required mcr according to the both imo 2016 and imo 2013 imo 2014 imo 2015 standards and even the required mcr according to mpl which suggests that the mpl and standard wave heights may need to be increased for small bulk carriers particularly handysize and handymax size note however that ensuring the same safety level for small vessels as for big vessels is technically and economically challenging large bulk carriers have enough mcr for propulsion ability which agrees with the accident statistics the required mcr to satisfy steering ability criterion corresponding to standards in imo 2016 agrees with the required mcr for propulsion ability criterion for small bulk carriers but is much greater for large bulk carriers l pp 250 m referring to the accident data for big ships the levelling off of the standard wave height for steering ability criterion can be used for l pp 250 m similarly to the propulsion ability standard the required minimum mcr to satisfy standards based on 10 low power cut off agree well between the propulsion ability and steering ability criteria 4 3 tankers fig 12 compares the required mcr according to different standards with fairplay database and accident statistics for tankers the vertical lines in the left hand side plot indicate size boundaries for small deadweight below 10000 t handysize 10000 60000 t panamax 60000 80000 t aframax 80000 120000 t suezmax 120000 200000 t and vlcc ulcc above 200000 t tankers while having the largest fleet in service tankers are involved only in 8 of all relevant accidents and are on the seventh place in terms of the number of relevant accidents per ship per year about 60 of accidents happened en route this and the fact that tankers involved in accidents are on average smaller than fleet in service suggests that part of accidents may happen due to insufficient power for manoeuvring in adverse conditions the distribution of accidents per size class is bimodal with one peak for small tankers 30 4 and the other one for aframax tankers 39 1 vlcc and ulcc tankers were not involved in the relevant accidents the average mcr of small panamax and aframax tankers in the accident database is relatively low significantly less than the mpl of 2013 interim guidelines the power defined from numerical assessment required to satisfy the proposed standards is close to the power from the accident database almost all big tankers can satisfy the shopera proposed standards which agrees with the accident database 4 4 container ships fig 13 shows the studied container ships together with their fairplay database and accident data container ships account only for 4 of the relevant accidents per year and are the safest ship type from considered in terms of the number of accidents per ship per year because they are sufficiently powered and especially larger ships have less frequent port calls than other ship types and usually require tug assistance most of accidents happen in ports some in restricted waters and almost none en route fig 2 which suggests that the relevant criterion for manoeuvrability of container ships in adverse conditions is the limited speed manoeuvrability in restricted waters which is not related to the installed power the marginal wave heights of the studied container vessels calculated with the comprehensive assessment are compared with the standards from imo 2016 and imo 2013 imo 2014 imo 2015 in fig 14 the results show that all studied ships satisfy all standards even the ships selected along the low power boundary of their fairplay database although almost half of ships have a lower power than the installed power according to the accident database the accidents of container ships are not due to insufficient power therefore it is impossible to conclude whether the proposed standards for propulsion ability and steering ability criteria are sufficient for container ships in any case manoeuvrability of container ships at limited speed in restricted waters not relevant here should be addressed with dedicated criteria 4 5 general cargo ships general cargo ships have the largest contribution to relevant accidents 34 of all relevant accidents and because of the relatively small fleet in service 7 of the entire fleet have the highest rate of the relevant accidents per ship per year one contributing factor is the frequent calls at small ports on the other hand whereas the dominating portion of accidents happen in ports the shares of accidents en route and in restricted waters are also significant the ships involved in accidents are smaller than the average fleet in service all general cargo ships involved in accidents have deadweight less than 20000 t this suggests that insufficient power for manoeuvrability in adverse conditions may be a contributing factor to the high frequency of accidents fig 15 shows the studied general cargo vessels together with their fairplay database and accident data and fig 16 compares the marginal wave heights obtained with the simplified and comprehensive assessments using the standards from imo 2016 and imo 2013 imo 2014 imo 2015 almost half of existing small general cargo ships have lower power than that from the accident database besides the average power of ships involved in accidents satisfies mpl and standards from imo 2016 therefore the standards may need to be increased for small general cargo vessels similarly to small bulk carriers 4 6 cruise ships fig 17 shows the cruise ships used in the case studies together with their fairplay database and accident data cruise vessels are involved only in 5 of relevant accidents however because of the small size of fleet at risk they occupy the third place after general cargo and roro vessels in terms of the number of accidents per ship per year almost all relevant accidents happen in port a very insignificant portion in restricted areas and no accidents en route cruise vessels involved in relevant accidents are big ships in terms of size and power majority of cruise ships in the accident database are middle sized vessels of grt from 10000 to 60000 t 63 6 and there are no small vessels with grt up to 10000 t in the accident data this means that insufficient installed power for propulsion ability and steering ability in adverse conditions is not a relevant reason of the accidents of cruise ships and the relevant scenario is manoeuvring at limited speed in ports and restricted waters which will lead to additional requirements on the steering system but not to requirements on the installed power fig 18 shows marginal wave heights computed with conservative simplified assessment of propulsion ability left and steering ability right together with standards from imo 2016 and imo 2013 imo 2014 imo 2015 the results show that cruise ships easily satisfy all these standards because the accidents are not due to insufficient power it is impossible to conclude whether the proposed standards for propulsion ability and steering ability criteria are sufficient for cruise ships 4 7 pure car carriers fig 19 shows the installed power of the studied pure car carriers together with their fairplay database and accident data pure car carriers are involved in 4 of relevant accidents and are ranked at a rather high fourth place after general cargo roro and cruise vessels in terms of the number of relevant accidents per ship per year ships involved in the relevant accidents are rather large ventikos et al 2015 37 5 of accidents concerned ships with deadweight above 17500 t majority of relevant accidents happened in port a small portion in restricted waters and only about 10 en route this means that insufficient installed power for propulsion ability and steering ability may be a reason of some accidents but cannot be the main reason more relevant scenario is the manoeuvrability at limited speed in restricted waters including ports which does not lead to limitations on the installed power fig 20 shows the marginal wave heights for the studied ships computed with the simplified assessment for propulsion ability left and steering ability right criteria vs standards from imo 2016 and imo 2013 imo 2014 imo 2015 the marginal wave heights for both propulsion ability and steering ability exceed all standards however sometimes only marginally which agrees with the data from accidents thus the proposed standards seem adequate for this ship type 4 8 roro ships roro ships are involved in 26 of relevant accidents over all ship types and are second after general cargo ships in terms of the number of accidents per ship per year fig 21 shows the ro ro cargo ships used in the case studies their fairplay database and accident data the selected ships include a large power group close to the maximum power boundary of their fairplay database and a low power group close to the low power boundary of their fairplay database the dominating part of relevant accidents happen in ports and a smaller portion 25 en route all sizes of ships are involved in accidents in terms of deadweight however installed power of the accident ships is higher than installed power of about half of existing ships of the same size thus insufficient installed power may be relevant in some accidents but is not the dominating reason more relevant scenario is the limited speed manoeuvrability in restricted waters including ports fig 22 shows the marginal wave heights obtained with the simplified assessment of propulsion ability left and steering ability right together with standards from imo 2016 and imo 2013 imo 2014 imo 2015 excepting one vessel the marginal wave heights of studied ships exceed the standards one low power ship does not satisfy standards but is likely to satisfy them marginally when the comprehensive assessment is used thus the assessment results are consistent with the accident statistics and the proposed standards seem appropriate for this ship type 4 9 ropax ships for roro passenger ships the relevant accidents happen almost exclusively in port a large portion of accidents are contacts mostly striking the pier during berthing or unberthing very insignificant portion of accidents happen in restricted waters or en route fig 23 shows studied ships together with their fairplay database and accident data ships involved in accidents have larger installed power than the average installed power of ships in service of the same size the locations of accidents and installed power of the accident ships imply that insufficient installed power is not the most contributing reason of accidents for roro passenger vessels whereas limited speed manoeuvrability in ports is the most contributing reason of accidents fig 24 shows marginal wave heights from the simplified assessment of propulsion ability left and steering ability right together with standards from imo 2016 and imo 2013 imo 2014 imo 2015 all selected ships satisfy standards by a large margin however because insufficient installed power is not a reason of accidents for roro passenger ships we cannot conclude on the adequacy of the proposed standards for this ship type 4 10 gas carriers gas carriers contribute to only 3 of relevant accidents and occupy the sixth place in terms of the number of accidents per ship per year the accidents are almost uniformly distributed between ports restricted waters and en route 72 of gas carriers involved in the relevant accidents are small vessels with up to 40000 m3 gas carrying capacity on the average ships involved in accidents are smaller than the fleet in service in terms of deadweight and installed power thus insufficient power for propulsion and steering in adverse weather conditions may be a reason of some accidents for this ship type fig 25 shows studied gas carriers together with their fairplay database and data from the relevant accidents fig 26 shows the marginal wave heights according to simplified propulsion ability left and steering ability right assessment together with the standards from imo 2016 and imo 2013 imo 2014 imo 2015 marginal wave heights according to the propulsion ability criterion for the smaller ships are close to the standard from imo 2016 note that the installed power of the smallest ship is less than the average installed power from the accident database thus the accident statistics agree with the standards from imo 2016 and thus confirm their adequacy for this ship type 5 potential for contradiction with eedi the marginal wave heights obtained with the comprehensive assessment fig 7 show despite some spreading of results for individual ships that in general propulsion ability standards imo 2016 and imo 2013 imo 2014 imo 2015 as well as standards based on 10 low power boundary are satisfied by eedi phase 1 and 2 compliant bulk carriers and tankers whereas satisfying these standards may be difficult for eedi phase 3 compliant bulk carriers and tankers fig 27 compares marginal wave heights obtained with the simplified propulsion ability left and steering ability right assessment between bulk carriers tankers container vessels general cargo vessels lng and gas carriers roro cargo vessels reefers and ropax vessels each plot includes vessels marginally satisfying requirements of a certain eedi phase 3 2 1 and 0 from top to bottom although the absolute values of the marginal wave heights in fig 27 are not relevant because they were obtained with the more conservative simplified assessment procedure and are therefore reduced compared to the results of the comprehensive assessment in fig 7 the differences between different ship types are correctly estimated the results show that for each eedi phase bulk carriers and tankers show remarkably similar marginal significant wave heights which are lowest over all ship types container vessels satisfying requirements of the same phase of eedi implementation demonstrate significantly larger marginal wave heights due to high installed power passenger vessels ropax and cruise vessels show significantly greater marginal wave heights than vessels of other types compliant with the requirements of the same phase of eedi implementation partially due to advanced propulsion and steering systems twin screw diesel electric main propulsion controlled pitch propeller pods all considered vessel types excepting bulk carriers and tankers can satisfy the requirements of the proposed manoeuvrability criteria with the proposed standards and simultaneously fulfil the requirements of phase 3 of eedi implementation on the other hand bulk carriers and tankers satisfying the proposed manoeuvrability standards can fulfil the eedi phase 2 requirements but not those of phase 3 when conventional propulsion and usual light propeller margins are used reducing the installed power to achieve eedi phase 3 requirements is therefore not possible without reducing standards for manoeuvrability in adverse conditions all selected ro ro passenger ships were not able to fulfil the eedi phase 3 requirements at the same time they demonstrated marginal wave heights with respect to the propulsion ability and steering ability in adverse conditions well in excess of the proposed standards optimisation studies zaraphonitis et al 2016 and plessas et al 2018 show that roro passenger vessels able to fulfil eedi phase 3 requirements are also able to satisfy the proposed standards for manoeuvrability in adverse conditions however the fulfilment of eedi phase 3 requirements themselves may be problematic for these vessels because of other limitations concerning design and operation for ro ro cargo ships it was impossible to fulfil eedi phase 3 requirements even for the vessels selected along the low power boundary of their fairplay database only one vessel could fulfil phase 2 requirements at the same time the assessment of steering ability and propulsion ability in adverse conditions does not show significant margins to reduce the installed power and still satisfy the proposed standards cruise ships ro ro vehicle carriers refrigerated cargo carriers and lng and gas carriers selected in such a way as to fulfil the eedi phase 3 requirements were also able to satisfy the criteria for manoeuvrability in adverse conditions with the proposed standards whereas all selected container and general cargo ships could fulfil both the eedi phase 3 requirements and the propulsion ability and steering ability criteria with the proposed standards container ships with big margins 6 discussion to address manoeuvrability in adverse conditions three scenarios and corresponding criteria shigunov and papanikolaou 2015 were applied weather vaning in the open sea weather vaning criterion manoeuvrability in coastal areas propulsion ability and steering ability criteria and limited speed manoeuvrability in restricted areas criteria concerning course keeping in strong wind in shallow and restricted waters these criteria were applied here to ships of all types covered by eedi regulations imo 2011 to investigate possible redundancies and to evaluate the proposed standards i e acceptance limits in terms of significant wave height and corresponding wind speed with respect to accident data and eedi implications correlation of the weather vaning criterion for the open sea with the propulsion criterion for coastal waters suggests that open sea scenario may be redundant although comparison with alternative formulations of the weather vaning criterion would be useful for conclusion the third scenario limited speed manoeuvring in restricted waters was not considered since the corresponding criteria lead to enhanced requirements to the steering system but do not impose restrictions on the minimum installed power therefore only the propulsion ability and steering ability criteria were considered using numerical assessment of propulsion and steering abilities of all ship types included in eedi framework in comparison with statistics ventikos et al 2015 of accidents due to insufficient manoeuvring ability in adverse conditions the rate of accidents due to insufficient manoeuvrability in adverse conditions per ship per year is largest for general cargo vessels followed by roro ships cruise ships and pure car carriers and further by bulk carriers gas carriers and tankers container ships lng carriers and refrigerated cargo carriers have the lowest rate of relevant accidents among the considered ship types for all considered ship types the most relevant scenario in practice is the limited speed manoeuvrability in restricted waters and ports for which the installed power is not relevant for roro passenger vessels cruise vessels and container ships this scenario is almost exclusively relevant for the manoeuvrability related accidents and for roro cargo vessels and pure car carriers it is dominating accidents due to insufficient power for manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions are relevant for tankers bulk carriers small general cargo vessels roro cargo vessels and perhaps to some extent also for pure car carriers and gas carriers from these ship types bulk carriers and tankers demonstrate very similar marginal wave heights with respect to propulsion ability and steering ability which are lower than the marginal wave heights for other ship types note that tankers and bulk carriers were used to define standards in imo 2016 and imo 2013 imo 2014 imo 2015 in comparison with the accident statistics these standards seem appropriate for tankers roro cargo vessels pure car carriers and gas carriers on the other hand for small bulk carriers handysize and handymax and small general cargo vessels deadweight less than 20000 t the average power of ships involved in accidents corresponds to higher marginal wave heights than standards imo 2016 and imo 2013 imo 2014 imo 2015 and even exceeds the minimum power lines of imo 2013 imo 2014 imo 2015 thus increase of standard wave heights and raise of minimum power lines may be appropriate for these ship types and sizes if the same safety level is targeted for small ships as for large ones note however that this will render as unsafe a significant part of ships in service which have lower installed power than the average installed power of accident ships the investigation of the compatibility of the proposed standards with eedi requirements shows that general cargo container and cruise ships pure car carriers lng and gas carriers and refrigerated cargo carriers when selected in such a way as to satisfy eedi phase 3 requirements are also able to fulfil the propulsion ability and steering ability criteria with the standards proposed in imo 2016 the same concerns in principle roro passenger ships however for these vessels the satisfaction of the eedi phase 3 requirements itself may be problematic because of other limitations concerning design and operation this conclusion is confirmed by optimisation studies zaraphonitis et al 2016 and plessas et al 2018 for roro cargo ships it was impossible to satisfy eedi phase 3 requirements even for vessels along the low power boundary of their fairplay database and the corresponding marginal wave heights showed that it is not possible to reduce the installed power of such vessels and still satisfy the proposed propulsion ability and steering ability standards bulk carriers and tankers showed the lowest marginal wave heights over all ship types if compared ships are selected to satisfy the requirements of the same phase of eedi implementation bulk carriers and tankers selected to marginally satisfy the propulsion ability and steering ability standards proposed in imo 2016 can fulfil eedi phase 2 requirements but not necessarily the requirements of phase 3 thus satisfaction of eedi phase 3 requirements by simple reduction in the installed power is not possible for bulk carriers and tankers without reducing standards a reduction in standards seems however not appropriate considering accident statistics especially for handysize and handymax bulk carriers on the other hand raising standards for these size categories will make problematic even the fulfilment of the requirements of phase 2 of eedi implementation a more general question requiring further discussion is the dependency of the acceptance standards on ship size and type the marginal wave heights were found dependent on ship size and type for the existing ships whether the acceptance standards should also be ship size and type dependent should be discussed with all interested stakeholders the last note concerns vessels with the deadweight below 20000 t shopera has studied many such vessels equipped with diesel engines and fixed pitch or controllable pitch propellers the results show progressively decreasing marginal wave heights with decreasing vessel sizes systematic studies involving a wider and more versatile selection of such ships need to be carried out to refine standards for such vessels 7 conclusions comparison of the available criteria for manoeuvrability in adverse conditions showed that the criteria concerning propulsion ability and steering ability in coastal areas are sufficient for the assessment of manoeuvrability in adverse conditions application of these criteria to representative low power ships of all types and sizes covered by eedi regulations showed that bulk carriers and tankers demonstrate similar marginal wave heights which are lower than those for other ship types therefore if acceptance standards should be independent from the ship type they should be based on the marginal wave heights of existing bulk carriers and tankers comparison of so defined acceptance standards with the statistics of weather conditions during relevant accidents showed that the standards seem appropriate for all ship types apart from small bulk carriers and general cargo vessels for these ships the average power of vessels involved in accidents corresponds to greater marginal wave heights than the defined standards thus an increase in standards may be necessary if the same safety level is targeted for small ships as for large ones if comparative ships of different types and sizes are selected so that they marginally satisfy the requirements of the same phase of eedi implementation bulk carriers and tankers again show the lowest marginal wave heights if satisfaction of eedi requirements is achieved by simple reduction in the installed power while fulfilling the propulsion ability and steering ability requirements with the proposed acceptance standards bulk carriers and tankers can satisfy requirements of phase 2 but not phase 3 whereas ships of other types can satisfy requirements of phase 3 of eedi implementation acknowledgements the authors acknowledge the contributions of participants of the shopera case studies especially dr evangelos

22888,introduction of the energy efficiency design index eedi raised concerns that ship designers may simply reduce the installed power to satisfy eedi requirements to address the problem by in depth research eu funded project shopera energy efficient safe ship operation developed criteria and acceptance standards for the assessment of sufficiency of propulsion and steering systems of ships for manoeuvrability in adverse conditions here their impact on ships of all types in the eedi framework is investigated and compared with the statistics of relevant accidents collected in shopera the comparison shows that the proposed standards seem appropriate for tankers roro cargo vessels pure car carriers and gas carriers whereas for small bulk carriers and small general cargo vessels stricter standards may be needed if the same safety level is targeted for small ships as for large ones the results also show that ships of almost all types studied can satisfy the proposed standards together with the eedi phase 3 requirements excepting bulk carriers and tankers which can satisfy the proposed standards and eedi phase 2 requirements but not those of phase 3 for roro passenger ships satisfying the eedi phase 3 requirements alone may be problematic because of other limitations concerning design and operation keywords manoeuvrability in adverse conditions eedi criteria standards case studies 1 introduction introduction of the energy efficiency design index eedi to improve energy efficiency of shipping and reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions has raised concerns that ship designers may simply reduce the installed power to satisfy eedi requirements this can lead to insufficient propulsion and steering abilities of ships to manoeuvre under adverse weather conditions this concern initiated studies by the international association of classification societies iacs which led to the 2012 interim guidelines for determining minimum propulsion power to maintain the manoeuvrability of ships in adverse conditions imo 2012 revised in 2013 imo 2013 and updated by resolutions imo 2014 imo 2015 to support the development of regulations concerning manoeuvrability in adverse conditions by in depth research several research projects were initiated world wide among them the eu funded project shopera energy efficient safe ship operation www shopera org 2013 2016 imo 2016 representing the whole spectrum of the european maritime industry classification societies universities research organisations ship designers shipyards and ship operators the project developed criteria for the assessment of sufficiency of propulsion and steering systems of ships for manoeuvrability in adverse conditions adapted and validated hydrodynamic methods for analysis of seakeeping and manoeuvring performance of ships in complex environmental conditions integrated these tools into a ship design software platform combined with a multi objective optimization procedure and ultimately contributed to the development of updated requirements to the propulsion and steering abilities of ships for sufficient manoeuvrability in adverse conditions imo 2016 this paper investigates the impact of the proposed requirements on design and operational characteristics of various ship types the following terminology is used here the term criterion refers to a characteristic of the ship such as ability to turn keep course weather vane etc relevant for the considered problem the corresponding measure e g turning diameter or overshoot angle quantifies numerically the ship s performance with respect to the respective criterion for the manoeuvrability in adverse conditions a convenient and popular measure is the marginal i e maximum weather severity specified by wave height and wind speed up to which the ship can fulfil the criterion change or keep course weather vane etc the term standard refers to the acceptance limit for a measure to consider the ship as fulfilling the defined criterion here the standard is the prescribed significant wave height and the related wind force at which the ship should be able to fulfil the corresponding criterion shopera considered three scenarios of adverse conditions in which manoeuvrability of ships is challenged in different ways and which require therefore specific criteria manoeuvring in the open sea in coastal waters and in restricted areas at limited speed shigunov and papanikolaou 2015 the open sea scenario imposes less strict requirements on the manoeuvring it is sufficient that the ship can weather vane i e change heading into a favourable one with respect to the environment and keep this heading this leads to the following practical weather vaning criterion the ship should be able to keep heading in head to bow quartering seaway up to 60 off bow the second scenario manoeuvring in coastal waters imposes stronger functional requirements on ship s manoeuvrability in principle any manoeuvre may be required sometimes in complex navigational situations and in seaway directions unfavourable for manoeuvring however the environmental conditions are less severe than in the open sea because in an increasing storm ship masters timely search for shelter or leave to the open sea therefore this scenario requires both a sufficient steering ability to avoid grounding collision or contact and a sufficient propulsion ability to enable timely leaving coastal area both are required in any seaway direction correspondingly two practical criteria were proposed for coastal areas steering ability the ship s ability to perform any manoeuvre in seaway from any direction and propulsion ability the ship s ability to maintain 6 knots speed in seaway from any direction because the ability of the ship to perform any manoeuvre is impossible to evaluate in practice a practical easy to evaluate steering ability criterion was proposed that the ship should be able to overcome environmental forces to start or continue course change in seaway from any direction note that the required speed in the propulsion ability criterion was increased from 4 knots in 2013 interim guidelines to 6 knots to consider possibly strong currents in coastal areas the third scenario manoeuvrability at limited speed in restricted areas concerns situations where the ship master must reduce the applied engine power and forward speed significantly below the available power because of navigational restrictions e g during approaching to or entering ports or navigation in channels and rivers as practical criterion course keeping at a specified low speed in strong wind in shallow water in shallow water near a bank and in shallow water during overtaking by a quicker ship were proposed this criterion was found relevant for majority of manoeuvrability related accidents in adverse weather conditions for roro ropax cruise and container ships ventikos et al 2015 however since full power is not applied in this scenario the corresponding criteria will not impose any restrictions on the minimum installed power or conflict with eedi requirements therefore this scenario is not considered the developed criteria once accepted need to be applied to all vessels subject to eedi regulations whereas the compliance with the imo manoeuvrability standards imo 2002 is demonstrated in full scale trials this is impossible for the assessment of ship manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions a practical assessment procedure developed by shopera and referred to as comprehensive assessment shigunov 2017 is based on separate evaluation of different acting forces and moments due to waves wind propeller rudder etc from simple model tests numerical simulations or empirical formulae and combination of these contributions in a simple numerical model shigunov 2017 whereas such assessment may be required for cases with large uncertainties such as innovative propulsion and steering solutions simpler assessment procedures are also required which can be used for the majority of ships however the simplifications must be compensated by some safety margins which makes such simplified procedures more conservative than the comprehensive assessment still they are sufficiently accurate for most conventional vessels can be employed by designers already in early design stage and can be routinely used by administrations shopera developed a procedure of complexity of a spreadsheet calculation called simplified assessment description will be published elsewhere which considers the physics of the problem but uses a reduced number of assessment situations and reduced complexity of motion equations while still allowing free choice between experimental numerical or empirical methods to evaluate different input elements to evaluate the manoeuvrability criteria the brake power required to satisfy a criterion is compared with the available brake power whereas the former is the result of the assessment procedure the latter depends on the characteristics of the main engine which should be provided by the engine manufacturer including engine specific limits under high load the paper summarizes the relevant data used for the definition of standards and proposes an approach to quantitatively fine tune the standards in section 2 following this approach the standards are determined by the application of criteria for manoeuvrability in adverse conditions to all ship types and sizes in the eedi framework in section 3 in section 4 the standards are verified by their comparison with accident statistics section 5 studies feasibility of the simultaneous satisfaction of the requirements to manoeuvrability in adverse conditions and eedi requirements 2 approach to defining standards with an increasing wave height the brake power p b required to fulfil the weather vaning ability steering ability or propulsion ability criterion will increase at some wave height referred to as the marginal wave height this power will achieve the available brake power p b av so that the ship will not be able to fulfil the considered criterion if the wave height is further increased to differentiate between sufficiently and insufficiently safe ships the acceptance limit standard needs to be established for the marginal wave height in shopera several sources were used to estimate the relevant values for the standards observations of wind and waves in the open sea and coastal areas relevant regulations interviews of ship masters detailed accident investigations as well as statistics of accidents due to insufficient manoeuvrability in adverse conditions including accident rates locations and corresponding environmental conditions it is not feasible and not necessary to design ships for manoeuvring in the worst possible storms that can be theoretically encountered when considering ship s economy and the fact that ships unable to manoeuvre in the open sea may drift for a limited time without risk for safety whereas in the coastal areas ships timely escape dangerous areas or search for a shelter before the storm escalates the relevant data concerning statistics of the weather conditions during ship collisions from the harmonisation of rules and design rationale harder project indicate that more than 80 of the collisions happened at significant wave height below 2 m whereas significant wave heights exceeding 4 m were practically not recorded paper imo 2010 collected requirements of classification societies related to the redundancy or duplication of the propulsion system to define criteria and environmental conditions relevant for steering and propulsion in adverse weather indicates rather mild standard weather conditions wind speed up to 21 m s and significant wave height up to 5 4 m for weather vaning and wind force up to bft 8 for 6 0 knots advance speed requirement for the scenario of increasing storm in coastal waters the 2013 interim guidelines imo 2013 imo 2014 imo 2015 defined the standards by benchmarking of tankers bulk carriers and container ships in the eedi database with respect to course keeping and advance speed criteria this led to the significant wave height 4 0 m and wind speed 15 7 m s for ships with l pp 200 m and less and significant wave height 5 5 m and wind speed 19 0 m s for l pp 250 m and greater with a linear interpolation of wave height and wind speed for l pp between 200 m and 250 m a summary of accident investigation reports in shigunov 2017 see also references therein indicates that the most frequent cause of heavy weather related grounding accidents is long waiting at anchor until it starts dragging and starting the engine too late or at a too low rate to avoid grounding in several accidents however vessels were not able to move away from the coast or turn into waves and wind despite full engine power applied the reports indicate wind force up to bft 10 more than 23 m s and significant wave heights above 6 0 m during accidents in coastal areas however in the well documented case n n 2008 where the significant wave height exceeded 6 0 m too long waiting of the vessel at anchor in an increasing storm was found as one of the main reasons of the accident the study of this accident in shigunov 2017 shows that at the significant wave height of 4 5 m about 80 of the initial number of vessels were still at anchor whereas 50 of the vessels left anchorage before significant wave height achieved about 5 5 m and 80 of the vessels have left to the open sea before the significant wave height achieved 6 0 m fig 1 the two vessels remained at anchor after that underwent a grounding and a near grounding accidents the conducted interviews of the masters of about 50 container ships bulk carriers and tankers concerning ship characteristics and environmental conditions relevant for manoeuvrability in heavy weather shigunov 2017 indicate that in the open sea the captain usually has more freedom and can decide what severity of weather conditions is acceptable depending on the freeboard cargo stability and propulsion and steering characteristics of the vessel even when caught in violent storms where steering against seaway may be impossible for any vessel drifting with seaway can be an option for a limited time however power matters in coastal areas when it is necessary to escape the storm and bring the ship into safe weather conditions in coastal areas the relevant environmental conditions are less severe because ship masters do not remain near the coast in a growing storm but either search for shelter or leave to the open sea 50 of the ship masters leave coastal areas before wind force achieves bft 8 and significant wave height achieves 5 0 m up to wave height of 6 m 80 of ships leave coastal areas however some ship masters reported wind force up to bft 10 and significant wave height up to 11 m as relevant for manoeuvrability problems shopera carried out an analysis of statistics of the accidents related to insufficient manoeuvrability in adverse conditions ventikos et al 2015 the calculated accident rates are in the range of 10 5 to 10 3 accidents per ship per year table 1 i e by one order of magnitude less than accident rates found in formal safety assessments which do not consider the prevailing weather conditions the most vulnerable ship types with respect to navigational accidents in adverse conditions are general cargo ships followed by ro ro ships cruise ships and bulk carriers table 1 factors increasing accident frequency are frequent port calls general cargo vessels roro ferries and large windage area cruise and roro vessels car carriers among the three navigational accident types groundings have the highest rates for cargo carrying ships in general whereas ro ro ships show the highest rates of contacts the accident locations vary between port areas dominating location for ro ro ferries roro cargo cruise and general cargo vessels and bulk carriers generally restricted waters significant contribution for general cargo vessels and bulk carriers and less frequently open sea en route conditions a significant contribution for general cargo vessels tankers and bulk carriers while very insignificant for other vessel types fig 2 important result is that including very rare abnormal weather events hurricanes typhoons etc in statistical analysis does not significantly alter the statistics majority of manoeuvrability related accidents happen in coastal areas observed significant wave height and wind speed average over all accidents are remarkably low 1 49 m and 10 m s respectively on the other hand maximum significant wave heights and wind speeds during few manoeuvrability related accidents can achieve up to 7 0 m and 20 m s respectively there is a statistically significant difference in mean wave height between ship types which means that some ship types are more affected by adverse weather scenarios than the others the largest wave heights during accidents are observed for roro ferries bulk carriers and cruise vessels and lowest for gas carriers in general the collected evidence shows significant scatter in the environmental conditions relevant for manoeuvrability from 1 5 to 2 0 m according to accident statistics in ventikos et al 2015 to 4 0 5 5 m according to redundancy requirements imo 2010 2013 interim guidelines imo 2013 imo 2014 imo 2015 interviews of ship masters and investigations of individual accidents although some cases indicate greater wave heights according to individual accident investigations and few interviews such cases were usually a result of human error and led to serious accidents i e they cannot be considered as typical operational practices whereas the above results are useful to estimate the relevant severity of environmental conditions exact definition of standards requires a more quantitative approach the most rational way to fine tune the standards is to benchmark the existing fleet with respect to the new criteria because the accident statistics ventikos et al 2015 show that the present safety level with respect to manoeuvrability related accidents in heavy weather is in general satisfactory a reasonable percentage of existing vessels should be able to satisfy the proposed standards note further in favour of such benchmarking that ship s manoeuvrability especially manoeuvrability in adverse conditions depends more than other ship s characteristics on the operational practices because operational practices cannot be changed abruptly e g due to the introduction of eedi calibration of design safety requirements with respect to the existing operating ships is a suitable solution note also that whereas the proposed manoeuvrability criteria address relevant characteristics of the ship its engine and propulsion and steering systems they are significantly simplified to remain practicable and thus the definition of standards should be considered as fine tuning of the assessment to reliably differentiate between sufficiently and insufficiently safe ships therefore dedicated case studies concerning all ship types covered by eedi regulations were conducted to define standards their adequacy was further verified by comparison with the accident statistics of the fleet in service as a function of ship type and size note that in addition to the wave height relevant wind speed wave period and wave energy spectrum should be defined following recommendations in imo 2016 and shigunov 2018 for the relevant environmental conditions for the assessment of propulsion ability and steering ability in coastal areas wind speed was assumed as v w 9 h s 0 44 m s peak wave period was varied from 3 6 h s 0 5 to the lower value of 5 0 h s 0 5 and 12 s and jonswap wave energy spectrum was used with the peak parameter 3 3 and cos2 angular wave energy spreading 3 definition of standards 3 1 selection of representative ships the case studies concerned bulk carriers tankers general cargo vessels container ships lng carriers gas carriers reefers roro cargo vessels ropax vessels and cruise vessels defined according to marpol annex iv chapter 1 regulation 2 imo 2011 and selected within the whole range of representative sizes because the installed power may differ significantly between ships of the same type and size to provide a rational basis for the definition of standards several series of ships consisting of ships of all sizes were selected along the lines in axes installed power mcr length between perpendiculars l pp each of these series cuts a certain percentage 5 10 20 30 etc of vessels of lower power at each size in addition four series of ships consisting of ships of all sizes were selected in such a way that ships in each series marginally fulfil the requirements of a certain phase of eedi implementation phase 0 1 2 and 3 finally a series of bulk carriers and tankers was selected for comparison along the minimum power lines mpl imo 2013 imo 2014 imo 2015 the examples of these series for bulk carriers are shown in fig 3 fig 4 shows series of container ships and general cargo vessels used for comparison covering the relevant range of ship sizes and including vessels along the low power boundaries of their ihs fairplay databases n n 2016 circled 3 2 assessment results for representative ships for the selected series of ships marginal wave heights with respect to the steering ability and propulsion ability criteria were defined using the comprehensive assessment fig 5 shows the marginal significant wave heights for the propulsion ability left and steering ability right criteria for bulk carriers and tankers with the installed power cutting 5 of low power vessels of their fairplay databases together with results for low power container ships and general cargo vessels the marginal wave heights for bulk carriers and tankers are very similar and lie significantly below those for container ships general cargo vessels have marginal wave heights comparable to bulk carriers and tankers or significantly greater depending on design one observation from these results is that the marginal wave heights depend on ship size larger vessels can satisfy the proposed criteria at greater wave heights than smaller vessels this follows from the physics of the problem however whether the standards should be ship size dependent is a subject for discussion with interested stakeholders in favour of ship size dependent standards note first that this dependency follows from the application of manoeuvrability criteria to existing vessels and thus reflects real existing design and operation practices and second that the consequences of accidents are generally greater for larger vessels thus the safety standards for them may need to be stricter these results as well as the results presented below also show that the marginal wave heights differ sometimes substantially between different ship types marginal wave heights of bulk carriers and tankers are lower than those of the other vessel types due to their bigger block coefficients and lower installed power per displacement compared to vessels of the same size of other types reaching a conclusion on ship type dependency of standards also requires a discussion with interested stakeholders the arguments in favour of ship type dependent standards are first that the differences in the marginal wave heights between different ship types result from the application of manoeuvrability criteria to existing vessels thus they reflect established design and operational practices and second that the consequences of accidents differ sometimes significantly between different ship types especially between passenger and cargo vessels on the other hand the differences in the manoeuvrability characteristics in adverse conditions reflect at least partially differences in the economic performance profiles of various ship types which should not affect the minimum required safety level this is evident when comparing e g the operational profile of ropax ships with that of slow steaming tankers and bulk carriers marginal wave heights for bulk carriers and tankers with the installed power cutting 10 and 20 of low power vessels of their fairplay databases are shown in fig 6 for vessels marginally satisfying the requirements of eedi implementation phases 1 2 and 3 in fig 7 and for vessels on mpl of 2013 interim guidelines imo 2013 imo 2014 imo 2015 in fig 8 3 3 proposals of standards in imo 2016 the following standard wave heights were proposed h s min 2 2 l pp 75 5 5 for the propulsion ability assessment and h s 2 0 l pp 100 for the steering ability assessment the standard wave height proposed for the propulsion ability assessment was based on the lowest marginal wave heights over the considered ship types i e on the marginal wave heights for bulk carriers and tankers and on the requirement that the standard should be equal to the standard wave height of 5 5 m from the 2013 interim guidelines for vessels with l pp 250 m and for other ship sizes cut approximately the same percentage of low power vessels as for vessels with l pp 250 m the level off of the standard at h s 5 5 m for l pp 250 m similarly to 2013 interim guidelines follows from the observation that largest ships involved in accidents are significantly smaller than average ships in service of the same type ventikos et al 2015 especially for container ships tankers and general cargo ships because they are less sensitive to adverse weather conditions have less frequent port calls compared to smaller ships and because they usually call for tug assistance when approaching port or navigating in restricted waters to define the standard wave height for the steering ability assessment in imo 2016 it was assumed that on the average the same percentage of vessels of each size should fail the steering ability requirement as the propulsion ability requirement because the steering ability criterion is stricter than the propulsion ability criterion the marginal wave heights are lower another way to define standards is to remember that according to the statistics of manoeuvrability related accidents in adverse weather conditions ventikos et al 2015 existing ships are in general sufficiently safe in this respect therefore ships of different types and sizes selected in axes l pp installed power along the lines cutting 5 or 10 of low power vessels of their fairplay databases can be assumed representative of existing low power vessels figs 5 and 6 however the 5 boundary may be influenced by wrong reporting in the ihs fairplay databases therefore the 10 low power boundary seems more suitable for bulk carriers and tankers along this boundary the marginal significant wave height can be approximated for propulsion ability criterion as h s min 4 5 l pp 170 70 6 0 and for steering ability criterion as h s 3 5 l pp 170 105 note that these approximations are valid only for bulk carriers and tankers with l pp 150 m table 2 and fig 9 summarise the proposals for standards 3 4 correlation between and redundancy of criteria another question investigated in the case studies was the possibility of redundancy of criteria the weather vaning ability criterion was treated in a simplified way as the ability of the ship to keep position in bow to bow quartering seaway this simplification follows from the observation that the ship with the traditional steering devices at the stern will not be able to keep heading under the action of environmental forces if the forward speed is not sufficiently large because of significantly reduced manoeuvring reactions on the hull and steering force on the rudder fig 10 left compares marginal significant wave heights for the propulsion ability x axis and weather vaning ability y axis criteria for the selected ships the latter are consistently greater than the former note also that the marginal wave heights according to these criteria are very well correlated which means that one of these criteria is sufficient the right hand side plot compares marginal wave heights according to propulsion ability x axis and steering ability y axis criteria these are also correlated to some degree however with significantly more spreading than for the position keeping ability vs propulsion ability up to the significant wave height of about 5 5 m the difference in the marginal wave heights between these two criteria does not exceed 1 0 m and the difference does not exceed 1 5 m up to significant wave height of about 8 5 m see the dash dot dot line which is 1 0 m below the bisect for significant wave heights up to 4 0 m and 1 5 m below the bisect for significant wave heights above 5 5 m these results mean that fulfilling propulsion ability criterion at some significant wave height means fulfilment of steering ability criterion at lower wave heights by 1 0 m for l pp 200 0 m to 1 5 m l pp 250 0 m for the sample this correlation is however not automatic and occurred because the selected ships have a properly sized rudder further it was investigated whether the imo manoeuvrability standards can ensure such a sufficient correlation between the marginal wave heights for propulsion ability and steering ability criteria for the well known benchmark tanker kvlcc2 the minimum required rudder area to fulfil the turning ability initial turning ability and yaw checking and course keeping abilities was found to be 67 0 83 4 and 116 2 m2 respectively when the largest area of these was employed the difference in marginal wave heights between propulsion ability and steering ability criteria was less than 1 5 m i e for this ship the fulfilment of the propulsion ability criterion together with the imo manoeuvrability standards ensures a sufficient correlation more case studies are needed to verify this conclusion for other ship types and sizes it was also investigated whether the imo manoeuvrability standards can make also the propulsion ability criterion redundant in which case assessment of manoeuvrability in waves is in principle not necessary the standard manoeuvres according to the imo manoeuvrability standards were simulated to check this suggestion the installed power was varied for kvlcc2 the results show that the installed power has very weak influence on the turning circle and the overshoot angles of 10 10 and 20 20 zig zag manoeuvres thus the imo manoeuvrability standards cannot make the propulsion ability criterion redundant 4 verification of standards 4 1 approach the adequacy of the proposed standards was evaluated by their comparison with the safety level of fleet in service for different ship types and sizes using accident statistics ventikos et al 2015 note that there were no relevant accidents recorded for refrigerated cargo carriers and lng carriers therefore the assessment results for these ship types are not included in this paper the study concerned bulk carriers tankers general cargo vessels container ships lng and gas carriers reefers roro cargo vessels ropax vessels and cruise vessels defined according to marpol annex iv ch 1 reg 2 imo 2011 and selected within the whole range of representative sizes and installed power values in addition to the series of designs used above to define standards 4 2 bulk carriers for bulk carriers fig 11 shows installed mcr required to satisfy different standards vs deadweight left and lpp right the standards include the minimum power lines mpl of 2013 interim guidelines denoted as mpl minimum mcr required to satisfy the propulsion ability 1 and steering ability 2 requirements with the standard proposed in imo 2016 shopera p and shopera s respectively minimum mcr required to satisfy the propulsion ability criterion with the standard wave height and wind speed according to 2013 interim guidelines 2013 ig and minimum mcr required to satisfy the propulsion ability and steering ability requirements with the standards based on 10 low power ships cut off 10 p and 10 s together with the ihs fairplay database fair play and the average values of mcr l pp and deadweight from the accident database ventikos et al 2015 accidents the vertical lines in the left hand side plot indicate size classes small deadweight below 10000 t handysize 10000 40000 t handymax 40000 65000 t panamax 65000 100000 t and capesize above 100000 t the vertical lines in the right hand side plot correspond to l pp of 200 and 250 m differentiating standards in 2013 interim guidelines according to the accident statistics bulk carriers have a rather high frequency of accidents 17 of relevant accidents over all ship types per year third after general cargo vessels and roro partly because of the very large fleet at risk in terms of the number of accidents per ship per year however bulk carriers are only on the fifth place after general cargo roro and cruise vessels and pure car carriers about half of all accidents happened in port and the other half is distributed between restricted and open waters this together with the fact that bulk carriers involved in accidents are on the average significantly smaller than fleet in service suggests that part of accidents may happen due to insufficient power for manoeuvring in adverse conditions the highest frequency of accidents is observed for handysize handymax and panamax size classes no relevant accidents were found for capesize bulk carriers numerical analysis shows that the average mcr of handysize and handymax size bulk carriers from the accident database exceeds the required mcr according to the both imo 2016 and imo 2013 imo 2014 imo 2015 standards and even the required mcr according to mpl which suggests that the mpl and standard wave heights may need to be increased for small bulk carriers particularly handysize and handymax size note however that ensuring the same safety level for small vessels as for big vessels is technically and economically challenging large bulk carriers have enough mcr for propulsion ability which agrees with the accident statistics the required mcr to satisfy steering ability criterion corresponding to standards in imo 2016 agrees with the required mcr for propulsion ability criterion for small bulk carriers but is much greater for large bulk carriers l pp 250 m referring to the accident data for big ships the levelling off of the standard wave height for steering ability criterion can be used for l pp 250 m similarly to the propulsion ability standard the required minimum mcr to satisfy standards based on 10 low power cut off agree well between the propulsion ability and steering ability criteria 4 3 tankers fig 12 compares the required mcr according to different standards with fairplay database and accident statistics for tankers the vertical lines in the left hand side plot indicate size boundaries for small deadweight below 10000 t handysize 10000 60000 t panamax 60000 80000 t aframax 80000 120000 t suezmax 120000 200000 t and vlcc ulcc above 200000 t tankers while having the largest fleet in service tankers are involved only in 8 of all relevant accidents and are on the seventh place in terms of the number of relevant accidents per ship per year about 60 of accidents happened en route this and the fact that tankers involved in accidents are on average smaller than fleet in service suggests that part of accidents may happen due to insufficient power for manoeuvring in adverse conditions the distribution of accidents per size class is bimodal with one peak for small tankers 30 4 and the other one for aframax tankers 39 1 vlcc and ulcc tankers were not involved in the relevant accidents the average mcr of small panamax and aframax tankers in the accident database is relatively low significantly less than the mpl of 2013 interim guidelines the power defined from numerical assessment required to satisfy the proposed standards is close to the power from the accident database almost all big tankers can satisfy the shopera proposed standards which agrees with the accident database 4 4 container ships fig 13 shows the studied container ships together with their fairplay database and accident data container ships account only for 4 of the relevant accidents per year and are the safest ship type from considered in terms of the number of accidents per ship per year because they are sufficiently powered and especially larger ships have less frequent port calls than other ship types and usually require tug assistance most of accidents happen in ports some in restricted waters and almost none en route fig 2 which suggests that the relevant criterion for manoeuvrability of container ships in adverse conditions is the limited speed manoeuvrability in restricted waters which is not related to the installed power the marginal wave heights of the studied container vessels calculated with the comprehensive assessment are compared with the standards from imo 2016 and imo 2013 imo 2014 imo 2015 in fig 14 the results show that all studied ships satisfy all standards even the ships selected along the low power boundary of their fairplay database although almost half of ships have a lower power than the installed power according to the accident database the accidents of container ships are not due to insufficient power therefore it is impossible to conclude whether the proposed standards for propulsion ability and steering ability criteria are sufficient for container ships in any case manoeuvrability of container ships at limited speed in restricted waters not relevant here should be addressed with dedicated criteria 4 5 general cargo ships general cargo ships have the largest contribution to relevant accidents 34 of all relevant accidents and because of the relatively small fleet in service 7 of the entire fleet have the highest rate of the relevant accidents per ship per year one contributing factor is the frequent calls at small ports on the other hand whereas the dominating portion of accidents happen in ports the shares of accidents en route and in restricted waters are also significant the ships involved in accidents are smaller than the average fleet in service all general cargo ships involved in accidents have deadweight less than 20000 t this suggests that insufficient power for manoeuvrability in adverse conditions may be a contributing factor to the high frequency of accidents fig 15 shows the studied general cargo vessels together with their fairplay database and accident data and fig 16 compares the marginal wave heights obtained with the simplified and comprehensive assessments using the standards from imo 2016 and imo 2013 imo 2014 imo 2015 almost half of existing small general cargo ships have lower power than that from the accident database besides the average power of ships involved in accidents satisfies mpl and standards from imo 2016 therefore the standards may need to be increased for small general cargo vessels similarly to small bulk carriers 4 6 cruise ships fig 17 shows the cruise ships used in the case studies together with their fairplay database and accident data cruise vessels are involved only in 5 of relevant accidents however because of the small size of fleet at risk they occupy the third place after general cargo and roro vessels in terms of the number of accidents per ship per year almost all relevant accidents happen in port a very insignificant portion in restricted areas and no accidents en route cruise vessels involved in relevant accidents are big ships in terms of size and power majority of cruise ships in the accident database are middle sized vessels of grt from 10000 to 60000 t 63 6 and there are no small vessels with grt up to 10000 t in the accident data this means that insufficient installed power for propulsion ability and steering ability in adverse conditions is not a relevant reason of the accidents of cruise ships and the relevant scenario is manoeuvring at limited speed in ports and restricted waters which will lead to additional requirements on the steering system but not to requirements on the installed power fig 18 shows marginal wave heights computed with conservative simplified assessment of propulsion ability left and steering ability right together with standards from imo 2016 and imo 2013 imo 2014 imo 2015 the results show that cruise ships easily satisfy all these standards because the accidents are not due to insufficient power it is impossible to conclude whether the proposed standards for propulsion ability and steering ability criteria are sufficient for cruise ships 4 7 pure car carriers fig 19 shows the installed power of the studied pure car carriers together with their fairplay database and accident data pure car carriers are involved in 4 of relevant accidents and are ranked at a rather high fourth place after general cargo roro and cruise vessels in terms of the number of relevant accidents per ship per year ships involved in the relevant accidents are rather large ventikos et al 2015 37 5 of accidents concerned ships with deadweight above 17500 t majority of relevant accidents happened in port a small portion in restricted waters and only about 10 en route this means that insufficient installed power for propulsion ability and steering ability may be a reason of some accidents but cannot be the main reason more relevant scenario is the manoeuvrability at limited speed in restricted waters including ports which does not lead to limitations on the installed power fig 20 shows the marginal wave heights for the studied ships computed with the simplified assessment for propulsion ability left and steering ability right criteria vs standards from imo 2016 and imo 2013 imo 2014 imo 2015 the marginal wave heights for both propulsion ability and steering ability exceed all standards however sometimes only marginally which agrees with the data from accidents thus the proposed standards seem adequate for this ship type 4 8 roro ships roro ships are involved in 26 of relevant accidents over all ship types and are second after general cargo ships in terms of the number of accidents per ship per year fig 21 shows the ro ro cargo ships used in the case studies their fairplay database and accident data the selected ships include a large power group close to the maximum power boundary of their fairplay database and a low power group close to the low power boundary of their fairplay database the dominating part of relevant accidents happen in ports and a smaller portion 25 en route all sizes of ships are involved in accidents in terms of deadweight however installed power of the accident ships is higher than installed power of about half of existing ships of the same size thus insufficient installed power may be relevant in some accidents but is not the dominating reason more relevant scenario is the limited speed manoeuvrability in restricted waters including ports fig 22 shows the marginal wave heights obtained with the simplified assessment of propulsion ability left and steering ability right together with standards from imo 2016 and imo 2013 imo 2014 imo 2015 excepting one vessel the marginal wave heights of studied ships exceed the standards one low power ship does not satisfy standards but is likely to satisfy them marginally when the comprehensive assessment is used thus the assessment results are consistent with the accident statistics and the proposed standards seem appropriate for this ship type 4 9 ropax ships for roro passenger ships the relevant accidents happen almost exclusively in port a large portion of accidents are contacts mostly striking the pier during berthing or unberthing very insignificant portion of accidents happen in restricted waters or en route fig 23 shows studied ships together with their fairplay database and accident data ships involved in accidents have larger installed power than the average installed power of ships in service of the same size the locations of accidents and installed power of the accident ships imply that insufficient installed power is not the most contributing reason of accidents for roro passenger vessels whereas limited speed manoeuvrability in ports is the most contributing reason of accidents fig 24 shows marginal wave heights from the simplified assessment of propulsion ability left and steering ability right together with standards from imo 2016 and imo 2013 imo 2014 imo 2015 all selected ships satisfy standards by a large margin however because insufficient installed power is not a reason of accidents for roro passenger ships we cannot conclude on the adequacy of the proposed standards for this ship type 4 10 gas carriers gas carriers contribute to only 3 of relevant accidents and occupy the sixth place in terms of the number of accidents per ship per year the accidents are almost uniformly distributed between ports restricted waters and en route 72 of gas carriers involved in the relevant accidents are small vessels with up to 40000 m3 gas carrying capacity on the average ships involved in accidents are smaller than the fleet in service in terms of deadweight and installed power thus insufficient power for propulsion and steering in adverse weather conditions may be a reason of some accidents for this ship type fig 25 shows studied gas carriers together with their fairplay database and data from the relevant accidents fig 26 shows the marginal wave heights according to simplified propulsion ability left and steering ability right assessment together with the standards from imo 2016 and imo 2013 imo 2014 imo 2015 marginal wave heights according to the propulsion ability criterion for the smaller ships are close to the standard from imo 2016 note that the installed power of the smallest ship is less than the average installed power from the accident database thus the accident statistics agree with the standards from imo 2016 and thus confirm their adequacy for this ship type 5 potential for contradiction with eedi the marginal wave heights obtained with the comprehensive assessment fig 7 show despite some spreading of results for individual ships that in general propulsion ability standards imo 2016 and imo 2013 imo 2014 imo 2015 as well as standards based on 10 low power boundary are satisfied by eedi phase 1 and 2 compliant bulk carriers and tankers whereas satisfying these standards may be difficult for eedi phase 3 compliant bulk carriers and tankers fig 27 compares marginal wave heights obtained with the simplified propulsion ability left and steering ability right assessment between bulk carriers tankers container vessels general cargo vessels lng and gas carriers roro cargo vessels reefers and ropax vessels each plot includes vessels marginally satisfying requirements of a certain eedi phase 3 2 1 and 0 from top to bottom although the absolute values of the marginal wave heights in fig 27 are not relevant because they were obtained with the more conservative simplified assessment procedure and are therefore reduced compared to the results of the comprehensive assessment in fig 7 the differences between different ship types are correctly estimated the results show that for each eedi phase bulk carriers and tankers show remarkably similar marginal significant wave heights which are lowest over all ship types container vessels satisfying requirements of the same phase of eedi implementation demonstrate significantly larger marginal wave heights due to high installed power passenger vessels ropax and cruise vessels show significantly greater marginal wave heights than vessels of other types compliant with the requirements of the same phase of eedi implementation partially due to advanced propulsion and steering systems twin screw diesel electric main propulsion controlled pitch propeller pods all considered vessel types excepting bulk carriers and tankers can satisfy the requirements of the proposed manoeuvrability criteria with the proposed standards and simultaneously fulfil the requirements of phase 3 of eedi implementation on the other hand bulk carriers and tankers satisfying the proposed manoeuvrability standards can fulfil the eedi phase 2 requirements but not those of phase 3 when conventional propulsion and usual light propeller margins are used reducing the installed power to achieve eedi phase 3 requirements is therefore not possible without reducing standards for manoeuvrability in adverse conditions all selected ro ro passenger ships were not able to fulfil the eedi phase 3 requirements at the same time they demonstrated marginal wave heights with respect to the propulsion ability and steering ability in adverse conditions well in excess of the proposed standards optimisation studies zaraphonitis et al 2016 and plessas et al 2018 show that roro passenger vessels able to fulfil eedi phase 3 requirements are also able to satisfy the proposed standards for manoeuvrability in adverse conditions however the fulfilment of eedi phase 3 requirements themselves may be problematic for these vessels because of other limitations concerning design and operation for ro ro cargo ships it was impossible to fulfil eedi phase 3 requirements even for the vessels selected along the low power boundary of their fairplay database only one vessel could fulfil phase 2 requirements at the same time the assessment of steering ability and propulsion ability in adverse conditions does not show significant margins to reduce the installed power and still satisfy the proposed standards cruise ships ro ro vehicle carriers refrigerated cargo carriers and lng and gas carriers selected in such a way as to fulfil the eedi phase 3 requirements were also able to satisfy the criteria for manoeuvrability in adverse conditions with the proposed standards whereas all selected container and general cargo ships could fulfil both the eedi phase 3 requirements and the propulsion ability and steering ability criteria with the proposed standards container ships with big margins 6 discussion to address manoeuvrability in adverse conditions three scenarios and corresponding criteria shigunov and papanikolaou 2015 were applied weather vaning in the open sea weather vaning criterion manoeuvrability in coastal areas propulsion ability and steering ability criteria and limited speed manoeuvrability in restricted areas criteria concerning course keeping in strong wind in shallow and restricted waters these criteria were applied here to ships of all types covered by eedi regulations imo 2011 to investigate possible redundancies and to evaluate the proposed standards i e acceptance limits in terms of significant wave height and corresponding wind speed with respect to accident data and eedi implications correlation of the weather vaning criterion for the open sea with the propulsion criterion for coastal waters suggests that open sea scenario may be redundant although comparison with alternative formulations of the weather vaning criterion would be useful for conclusion the third scenario limited speed manoeuvring in restricted waters was not considered since the corresponding criteria lead to enhanced requirements to the steering system but do not impose restrictions on the minimum installed power therefore only the propulsion ability and steering ability criteria were considered using numerical assessment of propulsion and steering abilities of all ship types included in eedi framework in comparison with statistics ventikos et al 2015 of accidents due to insufficient manoeuvring ability in adverse conditions the rate of accidents due to insufficient manoeuvrability in adverse conditions per ship per year is largest for general cargo vessels followed by roro ships cruise ships and pure car carriers and further by bulk carriers gas carriers and tankers container ships lng carriers and refrigerated cargo carriers have the lowest rate of relevant accidents among the considered ship types for all considered ship types the most relevant scenario in practice is the limited speed manoeuvrability in restricted waters and ports for which the installed power is not relevant for roro passenger vessels cruise vessels and container ships this scenario is almost exclusively relevant for the manoeuvrability related accidents and for roro cargo vessels and pure car carriers it is dominating accidents due to insufficient power for manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions are relevant for tankers bulk carriers small general cargo vessels roro cargo vessels and perhaps to some extent also for pure car carriers and gas carriers from these ship types bulk carriers and tankers demonstrate very similar marginal wave heights with respect to propulsion ability and steering ability which are lower than the marginal wave heights for other ship types note that tankers and bulk carriers were used to define standards in imo 2016 and imo 2013 imo 2014 imo 2015 in comparison with the accident statistics these standards seem appropriate for tankers roro cargo vessels pure car carriers and gas carriers on the other hand for small bulk carriers handysize and handymax and small general cargo vessels deadweight less than 20000 t the average power of ships involved in accidents corresponds to higher marginal wave heights than standards imo 2016 and imo 2013 imo 2014 imo 2015 and even exceeds the minimum power lines of imo 2013 imo 2014 imo 2015 thus increase of standard wave heights and raise of minimum power lines may be appropriate for these ship types and sizes if the same safety level is targeted for small ships as for large ones note however that this will render as unsafe a significant part of ships in service which have lower installed power than the average installed power of accident ships the investigation of the compatibility of the proposed standards with eedi requirements shows that general cargo container and cruise ships pure car carriers lng and gas carriers and refrigerated cargo carriers when selected in such a way as to satisfy eedi phase 3 requirements are also able to fulfil the propulsion ability and steering ability criteria with the standards proposed in imo 2016 the same concerns in principle roro passenger ships however for these vessels the satisfaction of the eedi phase 3 requirements itself may be problematic because of other limitations concerning design and operation this conclusion is confirmed by optimisation studies zaraphonitis et al 2016 and plessas et al 2018 for roro cargo ships it was impossible to satisfy eedi phase 3 requirements even for vessels along the low power boundary of their fairplay database and the corresponding marginal wave heights showed that it is not possible to reduce the installed power of such vessels and still satisfy the proposed propulsion ability and steering ability standards bulk carriers and tankers showed the lowest marginal wave heights over all ship types if compared ships are selected to satisfy the requirements of the same phase of eedi implementation bulk carriers and tankers selected to marginally satisfy the propulsion ability and steering ability standards proposed in imo 2016 can fulfil eedi phase 2 requirements but not necessarily the requirements of phase 3 thus satisfaction of eedi phase 3 requirements by simple reduction in the installed power is not possible for bulk carriers and tankers without reducing standards a reduction in standards seems however not appropriate considering accident statistics especially for handysize and handymax bulk carriers on the other hand raising standards for these size categories will make problematic even the fulfilment of the requirements of phase 2 of eedi implementation a more general question requiring further discussion is the dependency of the acceptance standards on ship size and type the marginal wave heights were found dependent on ship size and type for the existing ships whether the acceptance standards should also be ship size and type dependent should be discussed with all interested stakeholders the last note concerns vessels with the deadweight below 20000 t shopera has studied many such vessels equipped with diesel engines and fixed pitch or controllable pitch propellers the results show progressively decreasing marginal wave heights with decreasing vessel sizes systematic studies involving a wider and more versatile selection of such ships need to be carried out to refine standards for such vessels 7 conclusions comparison of the available criteria for manoeuvrability in adverse conditions showed that the criteria concerning propulsion ability and steering ability in coastal areas are sufficient for the assessment of manoeuvrability in adverse conditions application of these criteria to representative low power ships of all types and sizes covered by eedi regulations showed that bulk carriers and tankers demonstrate similar marginal wave heights which are lower than those for other ship types therefore if acceptance standards should be independent from the ship type they should be based on the marginal wave heights of existing bulk carriers and tankers comparison of so defined acceptance standards with the statistics of weather conditions during relevant accidents showed that the standards seem appropriate for all ship types apart from small bulk carriers and general cargo vessels for these ships the average power of vessels involved in accidents corresponds to greater marginal wave heights than the defined standards thus an increase in standards may be necessary if the same safety level is targeted for small ships as for large ones if comparative ships of different types and sizes are selected so that they marginally satisfy the requirements of the same phase of eedi implementation bulk carriers and tankers again show the lowest marginal wave heights if satisfaction of eedi requirements is achieved by simple reduction in the installed power while fulfilling the propulsion ability and steering ability requirements with the proposed acceptance standards bulk carriers and tankers can satisfy requirements of phase 2 but not phase 3 whereas ships of other types can satisfy requirements of phase 3 of eedi implementation acknowledgements the authors acknowledge the contributions of participants of the shopera case studies especially dr evangelos

22889,in this paper application of a nonlinear tracking control algorithm for dynamics testing of underwater vehicles is presented the controller suitable for fully actuated vehicles is based on a velocity transformation which results from the inertia matrix decomposition after use of the transformation some properties of the system dynamics are observable the matrices containing the dynamical parameters set are included next into the control gain matrices consequently it is possible introducing a set of indexes to propose a procedure for dynamics investigation the approach can serve as a useful tool before experiment because it gives an insight into the vehicle dynamic model the simulation studies demonstrated on a 6 dof underwater vehicle model show effectiveness of the given strategy keywords underwater vehicle nonlinear control transformed equations of motion dynamics evaluation simulation 1 introduction autonomous marine vehicles are employed in risky missions both commercial and scientific one of the benefits is their low cost in comparison with full scale and fully manned vessels underwater vehicles are some examples although there are various control tasks which can be realized by submarines in this work we limit ourselves only to the problem of trajectory tracking taking into account availability of variables in the control input vector the vehicles can be dived into two groups namely underactuated and fully actuated for each group suitable methods for trajectory tracking are proposed in this paper only some examples of the method used for underwater vehicles are recalled trajectory tracking with prescribed performance technique was given in bechlioulis et al 2017 chen et al 2017 proposed computed torque controller together with fuzzy inverse trajectory compensator do 2013 described a global tracking controller applied to underactuated odin vehicle problem of trajectory tracking based on backstepping technique was considered in li et al 2017 another approach using neural network was proposed in park 2014 an adaptive integral terminal sliding mode controller based on double loop control structure was shown in qiao and zhang 2019 this algorithm provided the tracking task taking into account adaptive dynamic compensation of uncertainties and disturbances another adaptive sliding mode control algorithm combined with neural network controller of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles with uncertain dynamics was presented in yan et al 2019 the integral sliding mode controller contained the dual closed loop design moreover some practical situations were considered which showed that there are systematic parametric uncertainties and external disturbances in the literature the tracking control strategies for fully actuated vehicles are also found one of them that took into account the hydrodynamic effects affecting the tracking performance was given in antonelli et al 2003 bessa et al 2010 proposed fuzzy sliding control method and chen et al fuzzy inverse desired trajectory compensation approach chen et al 2016 application of fuzzy neural network strategy for robust adaptive tracking was shown in liu et al 2016 various sliding mode control based methods are also used for trajectory tracking e g fjellstad and fossen 1994 garcia valdovinos et al 2014 joe et al 2014 munoz vazquez et al 2017 soylu et al 2016 wang et al 2016 sometimes combined with other methods as neural network gao et al 2017 or as supplement to the conventional time delay controller to improve the control precision kim et al

controller the saturation type controller and the smooth transition type controller known from the literature were compared via simulations in qiao et al 2017 there exist also experimental oriented tracking controllers e g in fischer et al 2014 robust integral of sign of the error based control scheme or in zhao and yuh 2005 so called adaptive plus disturbance observer control algorithm robust with respect to external disturbance and uncertainties in the system experimental comparison of three controllers namely pd el exact linearizing model based controller and nl nonlinear model based controller was done in martin and whitcomb 2018 this document differs from previous research because 1 the proposed algorithm includes directly the dynamical couplings in two control gains 2 it serves both for underwater vehicle trajectory tracking and dynamics investigation thanks to its feature it works quickly and the gain matrices are always related to the dynamic couplings of the system however it is limited for fully actuated vehicles the stability proof of the closed loop system with the controller is done in the sense of lyapunov the main difference between the proposed controller and various known strategies is that it gives some insight into the dynamics of the system which results from the inertia matrix decomposition this property is the basis for the study of underwater vehicle dynamics if the presented investigation method is applied we are able to test three models namely the vehicle model the selected desired trajectory and the disturbance model moreover changing parameters set and using the proposed indexes we can compare different vehicle structures the investigation method may be useful at the design stage because it needs only simulation verification the dynamics test procedure is as follows 1 design of the tracking controller that includes the selected desired trajectories the vehicle model and the disturbances model 2 use of the indexes related to the decomposed inertia matrix 3 investigation of the vehicle dynamics based on the indexes 4 conclusions made from the simulation test the performed computer simulations on a 6 dof basic model of underwater vehicle and calculations of indexes for models with modified parameters demonstrate validity of the proposed approach the reminder of this article is organized as follows in section 2 the transformed equations of motion are described in section 3 the proposed tracking control algorithm is introduced and its application for dynamics investigation is discussed in section 4 simulations are performed to demonstrate the proposed strategy finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 1 1 notation m r 6 6 the inertia matrix that includes a rigid body mass matrix and an added mass matrix

the gvc π r 6 the control vector in terms of the gvc w ξ r 6 the lumped dynamics estimation error in terms of the gvc 2 vehicle equations of motion with a diagonal inertia matrix the modeling of real underwater vehicles is difficult because the system as well as the environmental disturbances must be approximated the equations of motion are strongly nonlinear and additionally many physical phenomena as the propeller propulsion or hull resistance must be taken into consideration these problems are described for example in abs 2006 bo et al 2009 the general model can be simplified to a model which is suitable for the vehicle control the dynamical model of a 6 dof underwater vehicle presented in fig 1 is expressed in the body fixed reference frame can be assumed as follows fossen 1994 lantos and marton 2011 1 m ν c ν ν d ν ν g η f τ 2 η j η ν where 1 is the vehicle dynamics and 2 is the kinematics moreover we assume the model which approximated internal and external disturbances in the form 3 f δ m ν δ c ν ν δ d ν ν δ g η d t in the above equation the matrices δ m δ c ν δ d ν and the vector δ g η describe the internal inaccuracies and other model uncertainties the external disturbances are reflected in the vector d t remark 1 the model of uncertainties 3 is only an approximation of inaccuracy and physical phenomena model for moving slowly underwater vehicle such approximation seems reasonable however one of the aims of our approach is the test of effects arising from the considered disturbances model such model may appear useful for simulations because the parameters uncertainties and disturbances are included into f then the inertia matrix m can be treated as constant and symmetric the proposed controller will be expressed in terms of generalized velocity components gvc for this reason we introduce the following transformation of rates 4 ν ϒ ξ where the matrix ϒ arises from decomposition of the matrix m into three matrices i e m ϒ t 1 n ϒ 1 if we calculate the time derivative of ν then we get ν ϒ ξ taking the above into account and inserting 4 into 1 and pre multiplying both sides by ϒ t we obtain 5 m ϒ ξ c ν ϒ ξ d ν ϒ ξ g η f τ 6 ϒ t m ϒ ξ ϒ t c ν ϒ ξ ϒ t d ν ϒ ξ ϒ t g η ϒ t f ϒ t τ next after grouping the terms the transformed equations of motion can be written in the following form 7 n ξ c ξ ξ ξ d ξ ξ ξ g ξ η f ξ π 8 η j η ϒ ξ where the matrices and the vectors are 9 n ϒ t m ϒ 10 c ξ ξ ϒ t c ν ϒ 11 d ξ ξ ϒ t d ν ϒ 12 g ξ η ϒ t g η 13 f ξ ϒ t f 14 π ϒ t τ equations 7 and 4 together with 8 describe the motion of an underwater

time derivatives are bounded in the euclidean norm i e f ξ η ν ν t a 1 η ν ν t f ξ η ν ν t a 2 η ν ν t 15 f ξ η ν ν t a 3 η ν ν t the assumption is made taking into account references qiao and zhang 2016 soylu et al 2008 2016 in which similar conditions concerning underwater vehicles control were applied 3 dynamics investigation strategy the proposed method consists of two stages a tracking control algorithm design and its use for dynamics test the diagram which explains the method is shown in fig 2 3 1 design of nonlinear controller in this section the first stage of the procedure is considered the controller using the vector of the transformed variables ξ is presented in the theorem given below theorem 1 consider the dynamic model 7 4 and the kinematic relationship 8 together with the nonlinear tracking controller 16 π n ξ r c ξ ξ ξ r d ξ ξ ξ r g ξ η k d s ξ j ξ t η k p η f ξ where 17 ξ r j ξ 1 η η d λ η 18 s ξ ξ r ξ j ξ 1 η η λ η 19 s ξ ξ r ξ j ξ 1 η η λ η j ξ 1 η η λ η

vehicle to move at low speed for slow motion of the vehicle values of the vector f ζ will be relative small additionally values of the adaptive term w ξ decrease if the adaptive term starts to work for those reasons assumptions 1 and 2 seem to be reasonable in the worst case the system stability can be guaranteed by increasing values of k d and γ proof the closed loop system 7 8 taking into account the controller 16 we can write in the form 22 n ξ c ξ ξ ξ d ξ ξ ξ g ξ η f ξ n ξ r c ξ ξ ξ r d ξ ξ ξ r g ξ η k d s ξ j ξ t η k p η f ξ what leads to 23 n s ξ c ξ ξ d ξ ξ k d s ξ j ξ t η k p η w ξ 0 the proposed lyapunov function candidate is as follows 24 l s ξ η w ξ 1 2 s ξ t n s ξ 1 2 η t k p η 1 2 w ξ t γ 1 w ξ we calculate the time derivative of the function l 24 and apply equations 4 7 14 consequently we get 25 l s ξ η w ξ s ξ t n s ξ 1 2 s ξ t n s ξ η t k p η w ξ t γ 1 w ξ because the matrices m and ϒ have only constant elements thus n d d t ϒ t m ϒ 0 using also the relationship 23

taking into consideration 10 we obtain s ξ t c ξ ξ s ξ ϒ s ξ t c ν ϒ s ξ s t c ν s 0 because s t c ν s 0 for all s r n the matrix c ν is a skew symmetric one fossen 1994 moreover applying 21 the relationships γ γ t we get γγ 1 i i denotes the identity matrix therefore recalling 18 we can write 27 l s ξ η w ξ s ξ t d ξ ξ k d s ξ η λ η t j ξ t η j ξ t η k p η η t k p η f ξ t γ 1 w ξ s ξ t d ξ ξ

also qiao and zhang 2016 it is known that inequality of type as 28 does not imply that l 0 as t what means that the system trajectories may not converge to the desired state in the finite time it is possible to solve this problem applying barbalat s lemma e g slotine and li 1991 because l is lower bounded l 0 and l is negative semi definite only under assumptions 1 and 2 i e l 0 then one obtains that l must have limit there exists a non negative constant ρ such that lim t 0 l t ρ moreover equation 28 leads one to conclusion that l t l 0 which implies that s ξ η and w ξ are bounded taking into account assumption 1 and equations 16 21 it may be verified that s ξ w ξ f ξ and f ξ are also bounded consequently l can be determined and it is bounded one has lim t 0 0 t l σ d σ lim t 0 l t l 0 ρ l 0 from barbalat s lemma it results that lim t 0 l t 0 then l 0 as t this in turn implies that s ξ η 0 as t 3 2 application gvc equations and control algorithm for dynamics test the procedure for studying dynamics is based on the controller 16 because it contains the vehicle parameters in the control gains obviously one could test the performance of the vehicles using other control scheme to obtain information concerning dynamics however the proposed algorithm includes the parameters set in the matrices arising from the inertia mass decomposition when the vehicle parameters are changed then without modifying the controller gains one can recognize the effect of dynamic parameters on the vehicle behavior this type of method seems intuitive and allows one to select various vehicle parameters in order to investigate the system dynamics the first two indexes are used to estimate typical controller performance i e position and velocity errors however next indexes are related to the description of the dynamics using the gvc and to the decomposition of the inertia matrix and the couplings determination even the kinetic energy index allows one to calculate the part of energy that must be reduced by each variable individually the considered control scheme can be applied to trajectory tracking and also to investigate of dynamics of the vehicle more specifically to recognize dynamic couplings in the system this analysis is useful for evaluating various models of underwater vehicles the research procedure is as follows at the beginning we select initial model called case 1 which has a symmetric inertia matrix next we neglect all off diagonal elements and get the diagonal matrix called case 0 it has the subscript d in all indexes it is an approximation of the model from case 1 then we choose other models with changed parameters e g case 2 case 3 which will be tested comparisons of all models are based on a set of indexes we propose three groups of such indexes namely concerning the quality of control investigation the input signal effort and energy determination and the dynamic couplings investigation they are summarized below 3 2 1 quality of control investigation the main goal of the controller is tracking of the desired position and velocity trajectories hence we propose two indexes for evaluation of the control task index 1 is related to investigation of the position errors and index 2 to the velocity errors 29 index 1 i 1 δ η s δ η d δ η s d i 1 6 max η i min η i the subscript s means the tested model and d the model with the diagonal inertia matrix 30 index 2 i 2 δ η s δ η d δ η s d i 1 6 max η i min η i the indexes arise from application of the controller 16 3 2 2 input signal effort and energy determination index 3 refers to 14 31 index 3 i 4 δ π s δ π d δ π s d 6 i 1 mean π i 2 note that for the diagonal structure d we obtain π d τ d because the matrix ϒ is identity one index 4 refers to the kinetic energy which is reduced if the vehicle moves it is possible to determine k i reduced by each variable 32 index 4 i 5 δ k s δ k d δ k s d mean k i 1 6 mean k i this index results from the kinetic energy of the vehicle k e expressed in terms of the vector ξ as follows 33 k 1 2 ν t m ν 1 2 ξ t n ξ 1 2 i 1 6 n i ξ i 2 i 1 6 k i 3 2 3 dynamic couplings investigation indexes they make possible to determine couplings and their impact on vehicle motion index 5 results from use of the matrix ϒ in 4 the matrix ϒ 1 i allows one to calculate off diagonal elements because the matrix ϒ is upper triangular the elements occur only for the symmetric matrix m and represent dynamic couplings 34 index 5 i 1 δ ϒ c s δ ϒ c d δ ϒ c s c d 1 ϒ 1 i s ϒ 1 d where δ ϒ c d 1 index 6 arises from 14 and from that the matrix ϒ t i shows effect of couplings affecting for input signals τ obviously for a diagonal inertia matrix the last matrix will be zero matrix 35 index 6 i 6 δ π c s δ π c d δ π c 1 i 1 6 mean π i τ i 2 δ π s where δ π c d 1 index 7 is introduced to determine effect of couplings for the velocity vector ν this index reflects a deformation of the velocity because ξ ϒ 1 ν it results from 4 36 index 7 i 7 δ ξ c s δ ξ c d δ ξ c 1 i 1 6 max ξ i ν i min ξ i ν i where δ ξ c d 1 the seven indexes are next collected in one complex index i c s for each case defined by the equation 37 i c s 7 j 1 w j i j where the weight coefficients w i are chosen in accordance with the realized task e g tracking error accuracy energy consumptions couplings determination or taking into consideration more goals finally we analyze the obtained results and make conclusions concerning the tested vehicle structures 4 simulation results numerical simulations were carried out in order to verify the proposed dynamics investigation method at first the vehicle model and its parameters were assumed from herman 2009 as case 1 the inertia decomposition matrix was the same as in this reference all simulations were obtained using matlab with simulink the fifth order dormand prince formula ode5 with the fixed step size 0 01 s 4 1 control performance test the numerical simulations were carried out to show effectiveness of the controller 16 the aim of the simulation test is to show the performance of the algorithm containing dynamic couplings of the vehicle in the control gains for tracking it is assumed the following desired trajectory position and velocity profiles 38 η d 7 cos 0 1 t 6 7 sin 0 1 t 2 0 3 t 0 0 6 e 0 3 t 0 4 e 0 5 t t 39 η d 0 7 sin 0 1 t 0 7 cos 0 1 t 0 3 0 0 18 e 0 3 t 0 2 e 0 5 t t the disturbances term including the unknown dynamics as well as the external disturbances is expressed by the following vector of applied forces and torques 40 f 25 μ 1 e 1 100 8 μ 1 e 1 40 50 μ 2 1 5 μ 2 100 μ 3 2 e 3 6 50 μ 3 2 e 3 3 where the components are μ 1 6 cos 0 5 t sin 0 8 t μ 2 0 3 sin 0 5 t e 5 0 4 e cos 0 4 t 1 and μ 3 π 5 sin π 15 t π 4 cos π 5 t their time history is depicted in fig 3 the gain matrices for the gvc controller were selected to ensure position and velocity tracking error convergence without great overshoot and the lumped uncertainty error convergence as a results the obtained set of parameters is as follows 41 k d 10 3 diag 4 5 4 5 4 5 2 0 2 0 2 0 42 k p diag 1 1 1 1 1 1 43 λ diag 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 44 γ 10 3 diag 20 20 20 10 10 10 the desired and realized trajectories are shown in fig 4 we see that the control algorithm works correctly as it results from fig 5 all position linear and angular errors as well the appropriate velocity errors are close to zero after about 10 s the input forces and torques are presented in fig 6 a and b in fig 6 c and d the lumped dynamics estimation errors w are given it can be observed that their values tend to a limit value as it arises from the stability proof taking into account the simulation results we can say that the controller ensures satisfactory performance for case 1 therefore we assume this vehicle structure as the basic model 4 2 study of vehicle dynamics the second aim of this work is the use the proposed control algorithm to the vehicle dynamics investigation similar as the earlier test case 1 other tests were also conducted for case 0 the off diagonal elements of the matrix m were omitted and x g y g z g t were equal zero other parameters remained the same it means that the matrix is diagonal for the comparison two other models were also used namely case 2 and case 3 the sets of parameters are given in table 1 the dynamical and the geometrical parameters of these models are different it may be difficult to evaluate the considered model without some criteria in order to make such comparison the approach described in subsection 3 2 was proposed the obtained results are summarized in table 2 comparing separately values from table 2 we see that δ η and δ η are comparable in all cases thus the selected gain values cause that the controller works correctly even if the parameters set is changed it means that the assumed set of control gains gives acceptable tracking results for all tested models we conclude that the presented approach is robust in the chosen example however it appears that the structure from case 3 has the strongest couplings δ ϒ c δ π c δ ξ c and the kinetic energy consumption δ k is great we observe that the same task can be accomplished with different energy inputs to obtain more information we apply indexes and together with their weight coefficients values of the indexes are shown in table 3 case 1 is an ideal model or in other words an approximated model we observe that the obtained values of indexes are comparable for case 1 an case 2 the worst values are for case 3 based on i 1 i 7 it is difficult to decide which structure case 1 or case 2 is better to obtain more information three sets of weight coefficients are assumed they are chosen taking into account quantities important for the designer 4 2 1 set of weight coefficients 1 the most important is tracking performance the set is given by w 1 w 2 0 3 w 3 w 4 w 7 0 1 w 5 w 6 0 05 the index i c 1 is given in table 3 for case 1 the index is slightly lesser than for case 2 for case 3 it is unacceptable 4 2 2 set of weight coefficients 2 we decide that the errors of position and velocity and the control effort measured by π and the kinetic energy consumption k are important hence we assume w 1 w 2 w 3 w 4 0 2 whereas w 5 w 6 0 05 and w 7 0 1 the index i c 2 table 3 indicates that case 1 is better than case 2 for case 3 the index value is extremely large set of weight coefficients 3 finally we use the proposed approach to determine dynamic couplings without information about the control quality therefore we assume w 1 w 2 w 3 w 4 0 w 5 0 3 and w 6 w 7 0 35 the index i c 3 indicates that the strongest dynamical couplings are for case 3 for case 2 differences are small but couplings are bigger for case 1 than for case 2 4 2 3 discussion of results the test showed that using the proposed approach we are able to indicate among various models the model which not only guarantees good performance of the controller but also which is better from the kinetic energy point of view or from the point of view of the control effort moreover it is possible to eliminate structures which realize the control task but with high energy consumption in our example the worst values were obtained for case 3 thus the last model should be rejected it is difficult to choose between case 1 and case 2 however even slightly differences can give us an answer for this question case 1 represents the best structure small differences can be explained by the fact that in the control gains only dynamic couplings are taken into consideration instead of full vehicle dynamics the procedure is useful if we want to determine those couplings in the vehicle 5 conclusions a method of application of the tracking control algorithm for the underwater dynamics investigation is presented in this article the main value of the method is that using some indexes we are able to perform simulations to compare various model structures the introduced control algorithm can serve not only for trajectory tracking but also for dynamic couplings determination it is realized after transformation of the velocity vector expressed in the body fixed coordinates thanks to some useful observations arising from the inertia matrix decomposition and including the decomposed matrices into the control gains we obtain valuable information which is not available in the same way for well known trajectory tracking controllers the simulation test done on a 6 dof underwater vehicle and models with changed parameters showed effectiveness of the presented approach based on simulations and the introduced indexes we received some hints for the structure redesign in addition we obtained information about the effect of couplings on the behavior of the vehicle this method can be used before experimental research for comparison of various system models acknowledgments the work was supported by the poznan university of technology

underwater vehicles is difficult because the system as well as the environmental disturbances must be approximated the equations of motion are strongly nonlinear and additionally many physical phenomena as the propeller propulsion or hull resistance must be taken into consideration these problems are described for example in abs 2006 bo et al 2009 the general model can be simplified to a model which is suitable for the vehicle control the dynamical model of a 6 dof underwater vehicle presented in fig 1 is expressed in the body fixed reference frame can be assumed as follows fossen 1994 lantos and marton 2011 1 m ν c ν ν d ν ν g η f τ 2 η j η ν where 1 is the vehicle dynamics and 2 is the kinematics moreover we assume the model which approximated internal and external disturbances in the form 3 f δ m ν δ c ν ν δ d ν ν δ g η d t in the above equation the matrices δ m δ c ν δ d ν and the vector δ g η describe the internal inaccuracies and other model uncertainties the external disturbances are reflected in the vector d t remark 1 the model of uncertainties 3 is only an approximation of inaccuracy and physical phenomena model for moving slowly underwater vehicle such approximation seems reasonable however one of the aims of our approach is the test of effects arising from the considered disturbances model such model may appear useful for simulations because the parameters uncertainties and disturbances are included into f then the inertia matrix m can be treated as constant and symmetric the proposed controller will be expressed in terms of generalized velocity components gvc for this reason we introduce the following transformation of rates 4 ν ϒ ξ where the matrix ϒ arises from decomposition of the matrix m into three matrices i e m ϒ t 1 n ϒ 1 if we calculate the time derivative of ν then we get ν ϒ ξ taking the above into account and inserting 4 into 1 and pre multiplying both sides by ϒ t we obtain 5 m ϒ ξ c ν ϒ ξ d ν ϒ ξ g η f τ 6 ϒ t m ϒ ξ

control algorithm design and its use for dynamics test the diagram which explains the method is shown in fig 2 3 1 design of nonlinear controller in this section the first stage of the procedure is considered the controller using the vector of the transformed variables ξ is presented in the theorem given below theorem 1 consider the dynamic model 7 4 and the kinematic relationship 8 together

vehicle to move at low speed for slow motion of the vehicle values of the vector f ζ will be relative small additionally values of the adaptive term w ξ decrease if the adaptive term starts to work for those reasons assumptions 1 and 2 seem to be reasonable in the worst case the system stability can be guaranteed by increasing values of k d and γ proof the closed loop system 7 8 taking into account the controller 16 we can write in the form 22 n ξ c ξ ξ ξ d ξ ξ ξ g ξ η f ξ n ξ r c ξ ξ ξ r d ξ ξ ξ r g ξ η k d s ξ j ξ t η k p η f ξ what leads to 23 n s ξ c ξ ξ d ξ ξ k d s ξ j ξ t η k p η w

14 consequently we get 25 l s ξ η w ξ s ξ t n s ξ 1 2 s ξ t n s ξ η t k p η w ξ t γ 1 w ξ because the matrices m and ϒ have only constant elements thus n d d t ϒ t m ϒ 0 using also the relationship 23

taking into consideration 10 we obtain s ξ t c ξ ξ s ξ ϒ s ξ t c ν ϒ s ξ s t c ν s 0 because s t c ν s 0 for all s r n the matrix c ν is a skew symmetric one fossen 1994 moreover applying 21 the relationships γ γ t we get γγ 1 i i denotes the identity matrix therefore recalling 18 we can write 27 l s ξ η w ξ s ξ t d ξ ξ k d s ξ η λ η t j ξ t η j ξ t η k p η η t k p η f ξ t γ 1 w ξ s ξ t d ξ ξ

also qiao and zhang 2016 it is known that inequality of type as 28 does not imply that l 0 as t what means that the system trajectories may not converge to the desired state in the finite time it is possible to solve this problem applying barbalat s lemma e g slotine and li 1991 because l is lower bounded l 0 and l is negative semi definite only under assumptions 1 and 2 i e l 0 then one obtains that l must have limit there exists a non negative constant ρ such that lim t 0 l t ρ moreover equation 28 leads one to conclusion that l t l 0 which implies that s ξ η and w ξ are bounded taking into account assumption 1 and equations 16 21 it may be verified that s ξ w ξ f ξ and f ξ are also bounded consequently l can be determined and it is bounded one has lim t 0 0 t l σ d σ lim t 0 l t l 0 ρ l 0 from barbalat s lemma it results that lim t 0 l t 0 then l 0 as t this in turn implies that s ξ η 0 as t 3 2 application gvc equations and control algorithm for dynamics test the procedure for studying dynamics is based on the controller 16 because it contains the vehicle parameters in the control gains obviously one could test the performance of the vehicles using other control scheme to obtain information concerning dynamics however the proposed algorithm includes the parameters set in the matrices arising from the inertia mass decomposition when the vehicle parameters are changed then without modifying the controller gains one can recognize the effect of dynamic parameters on the vehicle behavior this type of method seems intuitive and allows one to select various vehicle parameters in order to investigate the system dynamics the first two indexes are used to estimate typical controller performance i e position and velocity errors however next indexes are related to the description of the dynamics using the gvc and to the decomposition of the inertia matrix and the couplings determination even the kinetic energy index allows one to calculate the part of energy that must be reduced by each variable individually the considered control scheme can be applied to trajectory tracking and also to investigate of dynamics of the vehicle more specifically to recognize dynamic couplings in the system this analysis is useful for evaluating various models of underwater vehicles the research procedure is as follows at the beginning we select initial model called case 1 which has a symmetric inertia matrix next we neglect all off diagonal elements and get the diagonal matrix called case 0 it has the subscript d in all indexes it is an approximation of the model from case 1 then we choose other models with changed parameters e g case 2 case 3 which will be tested comparisons of all models are based on a set of indexes we propose three groups of such indexes namely concerning the quality of control investigation the input signal effort and energy determination and the dynamic couplings investigation they are summarized below 3 2 1 quality of control investigation the main goal of the controller is tracking of the desired position and velocity trajectories hence we propose two indexes for evaluation of the control task index 1 is related to investigation of the position errors and index 2 to the velocity errors 29 index 1 i 1 δ η s δ η d δ η s d i 1 6 max η i min η i the subscript s means the tested model and d the model with the diagonal inertia matrix 30 index 2 i 2 δ η s δ η d δ η s d i 1 6 max η i min η i the indexes arise from application of the controller 16 3 2 2 input signal effort and energy determination index 3 refers to 14 31 index 3 i 4 δ π s δ π d δ π s d 6 i 1 mean π i 2 note that for the diagonal structure d we obtain π d τ d because the matrix ϒ is identity one index 4 refers to the kinetic energy which is reduced if the vehicle moves it is possible to determine k i reduced by each variable 32 index 4 i 5 δ k s δ k d δ k s d mean k i 1 6 mean k i this index results from the kinetic energy of the vehicle k e expressed in terms of the vector ξ as follows 33 k 1 2 ν t m ν 1 2 ξ t n ξ 1 2 i 1 6 n i ξ i 2 i 1 6 k i 3 2 3 dynamic couplings investigation indexes they make possible to determine couplings and their impact on vehicle motion index 5 results from use of the matrix ϒ in 4 the matrix ϒ 1 i allows one to calculate off diagonal elements because the matrix ϒ is upper triangular the elements occur only for the symmetric matrix m and represent dynamic couplings 34 index 5 i 1 δ ϒ c s δ ϒ c d δ ϒ c s c d 1 ϒ 1 i s ϒ 1 d where δ ϒ c d 1 index 6 arises from 14 and from that the matrix ϒ t i shows effect of couplings affecting for input signals τ obviously for a diagonal inertia matrix the last matrix will be zero matrix 35 index 6 i 6 δ π c s δ π c d δ π c 1 i 1 6 mean π i τ i 2 δ π s where δ π c d 1 index 7 is introduced to determine effect of couplings for the velocity vector ν this index reflects a deformation of the velocity because ξ ϒ 1 ν it results from 4 36 index 7 i 7 δ ξ c s δ ξ c d δ ξ c 1 i 1 6 max ξ i ν i min ξ i ν i where δ ξ c d 1 the seven indexes are next collected in one complex index i c s for each case defined by the equation 37 i c s 7 j 1 w j i j where the weight coefficients w i are chosen in accordance with the realized task e g tracking error accuracy energy consumptions couplings determination or taking into consideration more goals finally we analyze the obtained results and make conclusions concerning the tested vehicle structures 4 simulation results numerical simulations were carried out in order to verify the proposed dynamics investigation method at first the vehicle model and its parameters were assumed from herman 2009 as case 1 the inertia decomposition matrix was the same as in this reference all simulations were obtained using matlab with simulink the fifth order dormand prince formula ode5 with the fixed step size 0 01 s 4 1 control performance test the numerical simulations were carried out to show effectiveness of the controller 16 the aim of the simulation test is to show the performance of the algorithm containing dynamic couplings of the vehicle in the control gains for tracking it is assumed the following desired trajectory position and velocity profiles 38 η d 7 cos 0 1 t 6 7 sin 0 1 t 2 0 3 t 0 0 6 e 0 3 t 0 4 e 0 5 t t 39 η d 0 7 sin 0 1 t 0 7 cos 0 1 t 0 3 0 0 18 e 0 3 t 0 2 e 0 5 t t the disturbances term including the unknown dynamics as well as the external disturbances is expressed by the following vector of applied forces and torques 40 f 25 μ 1 e 1 100 8 μ 1 e 1 40 50 μ 2 1 5 μ 2 100 μ 3 2 e 3 6 50 μ 3 2 e 3 3 where the components are μ 1 6 cos 0 5 t sin 0 8 t μ 2 0 3 sin 0 5 t e 5 0 4 e cos 0 4 t 1 and μ 3 π 5 sin π 15 t π 4 cos π 5 t their time history is depicted in fig 3 the gain matrices for the gvc controller were selected to ensure position and velocity tracking error convergence without great overshoot and the lumped uncertainty error convergence as a results the obtained set of parameters is as follows 41 k d 10 3 diag 4 5 4 5 4 5 2 0 2 0 2 0 42 k p diag 1 1 1 1 1 1 43 λ diag 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 44 γ 10 3 diag 20 20 20 10 10 10 the desired and realized trajectories are shown in fig 4 we see that the control algorithm works correctly as it results from fig 5 all position linear and angular errors as well the appropriate velocity errors are close to zero after about 10 s the input forces and torques are presented in fig 6 a and b in fig 6 c and d the lumped dynamics estimation errors w are given it can be observed that their values tend to a limit value as it arises from the stability proof taking into account the simulation results we can say that the controller ensures satisfactory performance for case 1 therefore we assume this vehicle structure as the basic model 4 2 study of vehicle dynamics the second aim of this work is the use the proposed control algorithm to the vehicle dynamics investigation similar as the earlier test case 1 other tests were also conducted for case 0 the off diagonal elements of the matrix m were omitted and x g y g z g t were equal zero other parameters remained the same it means that the matrix is diagonal for the comparison two other models were also used namely case 2 and case 3 the sets of parameters are given in table 1 the dynamical and the geometrical parameters of these models are different it may be difficult to evaluate the considered model without some criteria in order to make such comparison the approach described in subsection 3 2 was proposed the obtained results are summarized in table 2 comparing separately values from table 2 we see that δ η and δ η are comparable in all cases thus the selected gain values cause that the controller works correctly even if the parameters set is changed it means that the assumed set of control gains gives acceptable tracking results for all tested models we conclude that the presented approach is robust in the chosen example however it appears that the structure from case 3 has the strongest couplings δ ϒ c δ π c δ ξ c and the kinetic energy consumption δ k is great we observe that the same task can be accomplished with different energy inputs to obtain more information we apply indexes and together with their weight coefficients values of the indexes are shown in table 3 case 1 is an ideal model or in other words an approximated model we observe that the obtained values of indexes are comparable for case 1 an case 2 the worst values are for case 3 based on i 1 i 7 it is difficult to decide which structure case 1 or case 2 is better to obtain more information three sets of weight coefficients are assumed they are chosen taking into account quantities important for the designer 4 2 1 set of weight coefficients 1 the most important is tracking performance the set is given by w 1 w 2 0 3 w 3 w 4 w 7 0 1 w 5 w 6 0 05 the index i c 1 is given in table 3 for case 1 the index is slightly lesser than for case 2 for case 3 it is unacceptable 4 2 2 set of weight coefficients 2 we decide that the errors of position and velocity and the control effort measured by π and the kinetic energy consumption k are important hence we assume w 1 w 2 w 3 w 4 0 2 whereas w 5 w 6 0 05 and w 7 0 1 the index i c 2 table 3 indicates that case 1 is better than case 2 for case 3 the index value is extremely large set of weight coefficients 3 finally we use the proposed approach to determine dynamic couplings without information about the control quality therefore we assume w 1 w 2 w 3 w 4 0 w 5 0 3 and w 6 w 7 0 35 the index i c 3 indicates that the strongest dynamical couplings are for case 3 for case 2 differences are small but couplings are bigger for case 1 than for case 2 4 2 3 discussion of results the test showed that using the proposed approach we are able to indicate among various models the model which not only guarantees good performance of the controller but also which is better from the kinetic energy point of view or from the point of view of the control effort moreover it is possible to eliminate structures which realize the control task but with high energy consumption in our example the worst values were obtained for case 3 thus the last model should be rejected it is difficult to choose between case 1 and case 2 however even slightly differences can give us an answer for this question case 1 represents the best structure small differences can be explained by the fact that in the control gains only dynamic couplings are taken into consideration instead of full vehicle dynamics the procedure is useful if we want to determine those couplings in the vehicle 5 conclusions a method of application of the tracking control algorithm for the underwater dynamics investigation is presented in this article the main value of the method is that using some indexes we are able to perform simulations to compare various model structures the introduced control algorithm can serve not only for trajectory tracking but also for dynamic couplings determination it is realized after transformation of the velocity vector expressed in the body fixed coordinates thanks to some useful observations arising from the inertia matrix decomposition and including the decomposed matrices into the control gains we obtain valuable information which is not available in the same way for well known trajectory tracking controllers the simulation test done on a 6 dof underwater vehicle and models with changed parameters showed effectiveness of the presented approach based on simulations and the introduced indexes we received some hints for the structure redesign in addition we obtained information about the effect of couplings on the behavior of the vehicle this method can be used before experimental research for comparison of various system models acknowledgments the work was supported by the poznan university of technology
