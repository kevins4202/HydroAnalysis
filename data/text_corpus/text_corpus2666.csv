13330,membrane concentrated landfill leachate mcll is a complex wastewater with high amounts of recalcitrant organic pollutants tio2 based photocatalysis is a promising technique to treat recalcitrant organic pollutants but the low quantum efficiency limits its application in this work an enhanced photocatalysis approach was proposed to treat mcll based on the synergistic effects of tio2 cuwo4 and h2o2 through which 90 56 1 1 cod and 71 83 1 3 toc can be removed and the degradation process followed pseudo first order kinetics the structural changes of mcll were examined by spectroscopic techniques uv vis spectral results indicate the effective removal of chromophores in mcll with decreases in molecular weight aromaticity and cc co content fluorescence excitation emission matrix coupled with parallel factor analysis was used to characterize the changes of fluorescent substances during the enhanced photocatalysis process two fluorescent components i e humic like and fulvic like components were identified both of which were effectively removed two dimensional correlation spectroscopy suggested the degradation of substances in mcll in the order humic like fulvic like components unsaturated conjugate structure the aromatic structure containing benzene ring this work provides a deep understanding of structural changes of mcll and offers a guidance for the treatment of mcll through enhanced photocatalysis by h2o2 tio2 cuwo4 synergism graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords membrane concentrated landfill leachate photocatalysis dissolved organic matter synergistic effect two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 1 introduction landfill leachate is produced in the sanitary landfilling of municipal solid waste which contains high amounts of refractory organic pollutants and possesses potential threat to the surrounding environment 1 traditional physical chemical and biological treatment technologies fail to meet the elevated effluent discharge standards 2 3 at present the main treatment for landfill leachate is biological treatment followed by advanced treatment the process includes membrane bioreactor mbr nano filtration nf reverse osmosis ro pretreatment disc tube ro and anaerobic biological treatment mbr nf ro 4 5 although the effluent quality with these treatments is excellent the residual membrane concentrated landfill leachate mcll is difficult to deal with for its low biodegradability and high levels of recalcitrant organics such as humic acid ha fulvic acid fa polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and teterocyclic compounds 6 7 advanced oxidation processes have been widely used in the treatment of refractory pollutant through generating active oxidizing substances with high redox potentials that can degrade the macromolecular pollutants into small molecules or directly mineralize the pollutants into co2 and h2o 8 9 among the various advanced oxidation processes tio2 based heterogeneous photocatalysis has many advantages including low operating cost non toxicity and high photocatalytic activity 10 however the low quantum efficiency narrow excitation wavelength range and easy recombination of the photo produced electron and hole pairs limit its practical application 11 12 to improve the photocatalysis activity of tio2 one way is to accelerate the interfacial charge transfer in tio2 by using co catalysts 13 recently cu doped tio2 materials have exhibited significantly enhanced photocatalysis activity 14 in which cuwo4 serves as an interesting candidate the main reason is that h2o2 is formed by the conduction band electron ecb on cuwo4 reducing o2 15 as a result the recombination effect of ecb and valence hand hole hvb is suppressed and the chemical reaction at the interface is promoted therefore the introduction of cuwo4 into tio2 photocatalytic system can have notable improvement on degrading organic pollutants 16 adding chemical oxidants during the photocatalysis process can also improve the degradation efficiency by generating oxidizing active substances such as oh and so4 17 the combination of h2o2 and tio2 has been reported for the enhanced photocatalytic oxidation of organic contaminants such as linuron 18 atrazine 19 phenol reactive red 20 sodium pentachlorophenate 21 and various types of wastewater 22 23 understanding the changes of pollutants through spectroscopic technology is very helpful for technical optimization and subsequent processing spectral methods have been widely used to characterize dissolved organic matter dom during treatment process such as uv vis spectra and fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem which can characterize the changes of aromaticity fluorescent component and functional groups 24 26 moreover chemometric methods promote the application of spectroscopy techniques parallel factor parafac analysis is a power tool to track the changes of different fluorescent component in dom 27 28 two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2dcos can extend one dimensional spectra to the second dimension so that the spectral resolution can be enhanced and the sequential order of spectral signal change can be identified by the signals in the covariance matrixes 29 30 in this work an enhanced photocatalytic approach based on the synergism of tio2 cuwo4 h2o2 system was developed to remove refractory organics in mcll the factors affecting the removal efficiency including the dosages of h2o2 cuwo4 tio2 and ph were explored during the enhanced photocatalytic process furthermore the degradation behaviors of dom in mcll were explored by using spectroscopic analyses 2 experimental 2 1 mcll sample the mcll sample was collected from a municipal solid waste landfilling plant in changsha city hunan province china the treatment technique used in the plant was mbr coupled with nf ro process the pretreatment process and properties of mcll are described in detail in text s1 and table s1 in supporting information respectively 2 2 preparation of cuwo4 cuwo4 was synthesized by the co precipitation method briefly 10 mmol cu no3 2 3h2o and 10 mmol nawo4 2h2o were dissolved in 1 l beaker with 250 ml pure water at 60 c the temperature was then increased to 90 c for 3 h thereafter once the samples were cooled down to room temperature they were vacuum filtered and the residual precipitate was washed using 50 ethanol finally the as synthesized cuwo4 was dried at 60 c for 10 h followed by sintering at 500 c for 3 h the xrd pattern of as synthesized cuwo4 is shown in fig s1 indicating the successful synthesis of high purity cuwo4 powder 19 2 3 photocatalytic experiments photocatalytic experiments were carried out in a self designed cylindrical glass reactor with 7 5 cm of internal diameter and 14 cm of height fig s2 a set amount of tio2 cuwo4 h2o2 30 w w and 250 ml mcll diluted 5 times were mixed in the photocatalytic reactor at room temperature by circulating cooling water the ph value was adjusted to the preset levels by adding 1 0 m h2so4 or 1 0 m naoh solution the reaction was irradiated by a 9 w ultraviolet lamp with a wavelength of 254 nm 2 4 analytical methods the ph and conductivity of the samples were recorded using ph meter mettler toledo fe20 usa and conductivity meter mettler toledo le703 usa respectively the concentration of cu2 was detected by icp oes icap 7400 thermo scientific usa toc concentration was detected using a toc analyzer toc l shimadzu japan cod was measured according to the standard method of china gb 11914 89 after microwave digestion before measurement the mcll samples were placed in water bath at 50 c for 2 0 h to remove residue h2o2 the uv vis spectra of mcll samples were measured using an uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2600 shimadzu japan the wavelength range was 230 nm to 350 nm with a scan interval of 0 5 nm fluorescence spectra were obtained from a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 4600 hitachi japan the detailed parameters are described in text s2 parallel factor parafac analysis and 2dcos were used to decipher the spectral information and to understand the removal behaviors of dom in mcll the detailed parameters and procedures are shown in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 mcll degradation efficiencies under different reaction systems to evaluate the performance of synergistic photocatalysis by h2o2 tio2 cuwo4 for mcll degradation the removal of cod in mcll with different reaction systems were compared as shown in fig 1 the cod removal efficiencies in different reaction systems followed the order uv h2o2 tio2 cuwo4 uv h2o2 tio2 uv h2o2 cuwo4 uv h2o2 h2o2 tio2 cuwo4 h2o2 tio2 cuwo4 system exhibited the minimum cod removal rate this is because tio2 and cuwo4 cannot rapidly catalyze h2o2 to produce oh without uv light obviously tio2 based photocatalytic activity can be greatly enhanced in the presence of cuwo4 photo generated electrons and holes can recombine rapidly during the tio2 photocatalytic process which reduced the photocatalytic performance 31 the transfer of electron hole pairs can be accelerated by adding cuwo4 due to the difference in band gap 32 cuwo4 can capture the photogenerated electrons generated by tio2 and promote the separation of electron hole pairs followed by accelerating the photogenerated holes to oxidize pollutants 16 in addition the electrons stored in cuwo4 can reduce o2 to h2o2 which also had a positive effect on the reaction system 33 3 2 removal of dom from mcll under different influencing factors to optimize the enhanced photocatalytic process the effects of h2o2 tio2 and cuwo4 dosages and ph on the removal of toc and cod in mcll were investigated through univariate condition experiments as shown in fig 2 a the removal rates of toc and cod showed an initial increase with h2o2 dosage from 20 to 90 mmol l and then decreased slightly with further increasing h2o2 at first the addition of h2o2 increased the yield of active radicals by eqs 1 2 however further increasing h2o2 dosages resulted in consumption of the generated oh through eqs 3 4 thus the photocatalytic efficiency was inhibited therefore 90 mmol l h2o2 was chosen as the optimal dosage for the enhanced photocatalysis process 1 tio 2 e cb h 2 o 2 tio 2 oh oh 2 h 2 o 2 hν 2 oh 3 h 2 o 2 oh ho 2 h 2 o 4 ho 2 oh h 2 o o 2 the impacts of cuwo4 dosage on toc and cod removal are shown in fig 2b the photocatalytic efficiency in the presence of cuwo4 increased and reached the maximum value at 1 2 g l cuwo4 when the dosage of cuwo4 exceeded 1 2 g l the decline of removal rates was possibly due to the shielding effect of excess cuwo4 19 the removal rates of cod and toc were compared at initial ph values varying from 2 to 6 as shown in fig 2c the photocatalytic efficiency was ph dependent and the maximum toc and cod removal rates were obtained at ph 3 0 in addition ph value can affect copper ion dissolution the dissolution rates of copper ions increased from 0 35 to 2 19 when ph decreased from 6 to 2 overall the dissolution of copper ion was negligible as a result the optimal ph value was set at 3 0 as shown in fig 2d the removal rates of cod and toc were significantly affected by the addition of tio2 and reached maximum value at 0 8 g l tio2 with the increase in the amount of catalyst from 0 4 to 0 8 g l the production of photo generated electrons and holes increased and the number of active sites in the reaction system increased 34 however further increasing the amount of catalyst from 0 8 g l to 2 g l resulted in a decrease in the removal rates of toc and cod this might be due to the agglomeration of the catalyst molecules that reduced the surface area and the dense tio2 molecules increased the reflection of light which reduced the utilization rate of ultraviolet light 15 based on the above results the optimal condition for the treatment of mcll by the enhanced photocatalysis process was 90 mmol l h2o2 0 8 g l tio2 1 2 g l cuwo4 at ph 3 0 for 5 h and the removal rates of cod and toc can reach up to 90 56 1 1 and 71 83 1 3 respectively 3 3 spectral changes of mcll by enhanced photocatalysis treatment to explore the degradation of dom structure in mcll the spectral changes of dom during the enhanced photocatalysis process were monitored and analyzed uv254 is a typical indicator of aromatic structure and is positively correlated with the values of cod and toc 35 as shown in fig 3 a the change of uv254 of mcll followed pseudo first order kinetics during the enhanced photocatalysis process with the increase of h2o2 dosages the degradation rate increased table s2 the uv vis absorbance rapidly decreased with time fig s3 which may be due to the destruction of the conjugated structure in mcll 36 the changes of uv vis spectral parameters are shown in fig 3b as the reaction progress the e2 e3 a250 a365 ratio gradually increased implying the decrease of molecular weight and the removal of aromatic structure 37 sr s275 295 s350 400 negatively related to molecular weight showed the same trend with e2 e3 38 39 e2 e4 a265 a465 is positively related to the contents of cc and co 40 this ratio increased firstly and then decreased which may be due to initial exposure and subsequent disruption of double bonds the removal of fluorescent dom in mcll was also investigated during the enhanced photocatalysis process fig 4 a and b show the fluorescence eem spectra of mcll before and after photocatalysis process respectively there were two peaks for the untreated mcll one strong peak located at ex em 250 450 nm and one weak peak at 330 410 nm which were associated with humic like substances and fulvic like substances 41 42 after the enhanced photocatalysis process a significant change in both position and intensity of the peaks were observed fig 4b two weak peaks at ex em 230 370 nm and 270 350 nm were observed with less intensity indicating the effective removal of fluorescent substances i e humic like substances and fulvic like substances eem parafac was employed to decompose the fluorescence spectra into individual fluorophores and obtain the relative concentration of each fluorophore 43 two fluorescent dom components were obtained based on core consistency test as shown in fig 4 a major peak located at ex em 250 450 nm was appeared in component 1 c1 two primary peaks at ex em 320 nm 280 390 nm and a weak peak at ex em 250 390 nm were appeared in component 2 c2 according to the location of the peaks c1 was related to humic like substances while c2 was associated with fulvic like substances 44 45 in the raw mcll c1 revealed a higher abundance with the relative distribution of 65 86 after the photocatalysis process c2 56 24 became the dominant the removal rates of fluorescent components in mcll under different operation conditions are shown in fig 5 the trend of fluorescent dom removal c1 and c2 was similar to that of cod and toc humic like substances exhibited a higher removal than fulvic like substances indicating that large sized humic like substances were more effectively removed by the enhanced photocatalysis process the main active oxidant of the enhanced photocatalytic process was oh and therefore the characteristics of the whole reaction was basically similar to other processes dominated by oh 46 3 4 mechanistic analysis of dom degradation by the enhanced photocatalysis process to further investigate the structural degradation pathway of dom in mcll 2dcos was applied to analyze the spectral variation during the enhanced photocatalysis process as shown in fig 6 a there is one predominant auto correlation peak located at 230 240 nm with high intensity in the uv vis synchronous 2dcos map indicating the significant removal of unsaturated conjugated bonds 47 one positive cross correlation peak 230 240 nm 240 320 nm appeared on the upper left of the diagonal in the asynchronous map fig 6b this suggested that the auto correlation peak in fig 6a was composed of two closely located peaks i e peaks at 230 240 nm and 240 320 nm the uv absorption at wavelength range 240 320 nm indicate the presence of benzene rings 48 judged from the signs of the peaks in the 2dcos maps the absorbance change at 230 240 nm was prior to that at 240 320 nm this implied that the unsaturated conjugate structure was destroyed prior to the aromatic structure containing benzene ring the synchronous fluorescence intensity decreased sharply with time in the range 200 500 nm indicating the oxidative removal of dom shown in fig s4 there was one predominant auto correlation peak located at 280 370 nm in the fluorescence synchronous 2dcos map with high intensity fig 6c while a strong negative cross correlation peak ex em 320 370 nm was observed on the upper left of the diagonal fig 6d likewise the auto correlation peak at 280 370 nm was resulted from the overlap of auto correlation peaks at 320 nm and 370 nm based on the signs of cross correlation peaks the fluorescence change can be concluded to follow the order 370 nm 320 nm indicating the prior degradation of humic like substances over fulvic like substances 49 the degradation mechanism pathway of mcll through synergistic photocatalysis process is visualized in fig 7 cuwo4 can capture the tio2 generated photoelectrons inhibiting the recombination of electrons and holes so that more oh can be produced and the oxidation efficiency was improved during the photocatalysis process humic like substances were removed in preference to fulvic like substances with a higher extent meanwhile the unsaturated conjugate structure was destroyed prior to the aromatic structure containing benzene ring in brief the photocatalytic process tends to destroy macromolecules complex structures firstly 4 conclusions in this study an enhanced photocatalysis approach was proposed for the treatment of mcll based on the synergism of h2o2 tio2 cuwo4 and spectroscopic methods were used to explore the degradation of dom in mcll during the enhanced photocatalysis process the removal rates of cod and toc were 90 56 1 1 and 71 83 1 3 respectively under the optimal condition of 90 mmol l h2o2 0 8 g l tio2 1 2 g l cuwo4 at ph 3 0 for 5 h the degradation of dom in mcll followed pseudo first order kinetics during the enhanced photocatalysis process uv vis spectral results indicate the effective removal of chromophores in mcll with decreases in molecular weight aromaticity and c c c o content eem parafac identified two fluorescent components in mcll i e humic like and fulvic like substances both components can be effectively removed during the photocatalysis process the 2dcos results suggested the prior degradation of unsaturated conjugate structure over the aromatic structure containing benzene ring and humic like substances were removed in preference to fulvic like substances the application of spectroscopy technology to the treatment process of mcll provides very meaningful

tio2 cuwo4 uv h2o2 tio2 uv h2o2 cuwo4 uv h2o2 h2o2 tio2 cuwo4 h2o2 tio2 cuwo4 system exhibited the minimum cod removal rate this is because tio2 and cuwo4 cannot rapidly catalyze h2o2 to produce oh

of the peaks in the 2dcos maps the absorbance change at 230 240 nm was prior to that at 240 320 nm this implied that the unsaturated conjugate structure was destroyed prior to the aromatic structure containing benzene ring the synchronous fluorescence intensity decreased sharply with time in the range 200 500 nm indicating the oxidative removal of dom shown in fig s4 there was one predominant auto correlation peak located at 280 370 nm in the fluorescence synchronous 2dcos map with high intensity fig 6c while a strong negative cross correlation peak ex em 320 370 nm was observed on the upper left of the diagonal fig 6d likewise the auto correlation peak at 280 370 nm was resulted from the overlap of auto correlation peaks at 320 nm and 370 nm based on the signs of cross correlation peaks the fluorescence change can be concluded to follow the order 370 nm 320 nm indicating the prior degradation of humic like substances over fulvic like substances 49 the degradation mechanism pathway of mcll through synergistic photocatalysis process is visualized in fig 7 cuwo4 can capture the tio2 generated photoelectrons inhibiting the recombination of electrons and holes so that more oh can be produced and the oxidation efficiency was improved during the photocatalysis process humic like substances were removed in preference to fulvic like substances with a higher extent meanwhile the unsaturated conjugate structure was destroyed prior to the aromatic structure containing benzene ring in brief the photocatalytic process tends to destroy macromolecules complex structures firstly 4 conclusions in this study an enhanced photocatalysis approach was proposed for the treatment of mcll based on the synergism of h2o2 tio2 cuwo4 and spectroscopic methods were used to explore the degradation of dom in mcll during the enhanced photocatalysis process the removal rates of cod and toc were 90 56 1 1 and 71 83 1 3 respectively under the optimal condition of 90 mmol l h2o2 0 8 g l tio2 1 2 g l cuwo4 at ph 3 0 for 5 h the degradation of dom in mcll followed pseudo first order kinetics during the enhanced photocatalysis process uv vis spectral results indicate the effective removal of chromophores in mcll with decreases in molecular weight aromaticity and c c c o content eem parafac identified two fluorescent components in mcll i e humic like and fulvic like substances both components can be effectively removed during the photocatalysis process the 2dcos results suggested the prior degradation of unsaturated conjugate structure over the aromatic structure containing benzene ring and humic like substances were removed in preference to fulvic like substances the application of spectroscopy technology to the treatment process of mcll provides very meaningful

13331,the presence of antibiotics in wastewater domestic water and sewage has been found to produce ecotoxicological effects on living beings fluoroquinolones fqs are recognized as critically important and highly prioritized antimicrobial and are frequently used in veterinary and human medicine the recalcitrance of these antibiotics along with their poor metabolism has led to their detection in manures and wastewater ciprofloxacin cip is a synthetic and commonly prescribed fq and the metabolite of enrofloxacin the veterinary drug cip has negative effects on the flora and fauna due to the emergence of bacterial resistance against fqs special attention is given to the environmental degradation of these antibiotics by microorganisms physicochemical processes and bioremediation are employed for the removal of cip but the lipophilic and hydrophobic nature of the antibiotics acts as a hindrance to their complete removal from the environment the present review gives an insight into the sources of fqs in the environment their detection and their impact on living beings cip removal is being paid special attention and recent trends in its removal are discussed graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords antibiotics fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin resistance bioremediation 1 introduction antibiotics are one of the greatest advancements in the field of medicine and they have been employed for the treatment of a wide range of illnesses and for promoting animal growth the antibiotics are partially absorbed by the system and a considerable fraction is excreted either in its original form or metabolized form therefore the use of animal excreta in agriculture can act as one of the major routes of the entry of antibiotics into the environmental matrices 1 the entry of antibiotics into the aquatic environment at lower concentrations poses a long term risk to aquatic organisms 2 excessive usage of antibiotics has resulted in antibiotic pollution in the environment and these polluted sites act as hotspots for the spread of antibiotic resistance in environmental bacteria the subinhibitory concentration of the antibiotics exerts selective pressure on microbes driving the evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria 3 among the antibiotics fqs are of interest since they have been increasingly used in households hospitals and veterinary applications 4 in biological treatment plants more than 70 of cip and norfloxacin nor gets adsorbed on the sludge surface as sludge is an accumulator of the antibiotics the contaminated sludge is used as biosolids in agricultural fields owing to the multitude of hazards 5 fqs are used worldwide in veterinary and human medicine they are the third largest class of antibiotics up to 70 of the fqs are excreted in an unmetabolized form which promotes resistance in microbial populations fqs are recalcitrant to degradation and have high adsorption affinities which result in their persistent nature and have a reported half life up to 580 days in soil and 10 6 days in surface water 6 over the last few years the fqs are detected frequently in wastewater but there were no reports which showed their degradation in the conventional wwtps the quinolone emergence was accidental as a by product of an antimalarial agent chloroquine nalidixic acid is the first quinolone to be discovered and showed antibacterial activity against enterobacteria 7 nalidixic acid is used in the treatment of simple urinary tract infections only later other quinolones were synthesized which broaden the antibacterial spectrum of these drugs different functional groups are introduced into the structure of quinolone which gives new compounds with better pharmacokinetics a wide spectrum of action high stability and less toxicity 8 table 1 shows the development of quinolone antibiotic generations fqs are eliminated via renal excretion and hepatic metabolism fqs get only partially metabolized in the liver and excreted via urine and bile cip is excreted in urine 65 and feces 25 23 quinolones are used in the treatment of both gram positive and gram negative bacterium the latest generation is active against anaerobic bacteria and bacteria which are resistant to sulfonamides and beta lactams nor and ofloxacin are used as both human and veterinary medicine whereas danofloxacin marbofloxacin enrofloxacin and sarafloxacin are used are veterinary medicine and cip is used as a human medicine only 24 cip is a second generation fq that is frequently detected in the effluents of wastewater treatment plants wwtps soils surface water and groundwater 25 cip is active against a wide range of bacteria and is used in the treatment of bacterial infections table 2 shows the cip detection using various analytical techniques it acts by inhibiting the bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid dna replication while interacting with the topoisomerase ii dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv in bacteria 30 mainly the broad spectrum activity of the fqs is due to the binding of the topoisomerase on the ketone and carboxyl group the high antibacterial activity of the fqs is due to the presence of fluorine at the 6th position substitutions at ethyl cyclopropyl and fluorophenyl position and piperazine ring can have an impact on the biological activity 31 cip is one of the most widely used fqs in human medicines 32 it is one of the main metabolites of enrofloxacin enr enr is n deethylated in animals which results in active cip showing enhanced antimicrobial activity 33 cip presence has been detected in environmental matrices such as soil 34 sediment 35 surface water wastewater 36 and manure 37 according to the reports of gonzales martinez 38 cip has an impact on the community structure of the microbes and their catabolic diversity 2 sources of fqs in the environment animal manure wwtp effluent biosolids contaminated with fqs are potential reservoirs of the antibiotics the mobility of the fqs in the water depends on the solubility the solubility of 1 g l is said to be hydrophilic and resistant to hydrolysis 39 the water solubility of the cip is 30 g l and enr is 130 g l 40 fqs enter the environment via both veterinary and human waste waste streams that originate from the hospitals animal farms and residential areas contain the fqs antibiotic fqs are partially metabolized so their excretion ratio ranges between 30 for norfloxacin nor and 70 for ofloxacin ofl 41 however enrofloxacin enr is metabolized completely into cip by de ethylation 42 the human application can result in fqs pollution the disposal of unused antibiotics into the environment and the discharge of effluent water containing fqs can cause pollution hospital wastewater contains the fqs which are used as human medicines in the range of 3 ng l to 240 μg l mainly cip ofl and nor are detected in hospital waste 43 the fqs concentration in the hospital wastewater is 30 times higher than in urban wastewater waste from livestock applications can also lead to fqs pollution in the environment enr ofl nor and cip are reported to be present in the range of 63 ng l to 585 ng l fqs are reported in manure in the concentration of up to 1 4 g kg 1 43 the data of fqs concentrations in aquaculture is scarce nor and ofl is reported to be present in the effluent water from breeding farms and fish nurseries 44 aquaculture is one of the most important sources of antibiotics the bohai bay in north china is an important source of antibiotics 45 table 3 shows the distribution of fqs all around the world fqs is present in a huge concentration in manure as it is not metabolized or absorbed in vivo in the chickens and livestock animals 55 3 ecotoxicity of fqs and its impact on living organisms ecotoxicological data are available for less than 1 of the drugs antibiotics are designed to act on specific tissues or organs or target a specific molecular or metabolic pathway but it affects non target organisms also fqs and their metabolites are highly toxic to algae plants bacteria crustaceans and fishes 56 the fqs compounds exert ecological effects on the soil microbial communities 57 the negative impacts of fqs include the ecotoxicological effects decrease in the microbial diversity growth inhibition and bleaching of leaves along with an increase in mortality freshwater sediments are also affected by the fqs the microbial community changes with repeated exposure to cip 58 ec50 or effective concentration defines the antibiotic potency and is the concentration of the antibiotic producing half of a maximal effect the fqs continuous discharge into the surface water creates toxic conditions for the aquatic biota cyanobacteria have ec50 0 005 0 465 mg l which make it the most sensitive organism to fqs whereas the ec50 of algae and plants reach up to 38 5 mg l for the environmental risk assessment the hazard quotient hq is calculated which is expressed by the measured environmental concentration mec divided by the predicted no effect concentration pnec 59 the fqs toxicity varies in different species and is mainly dependent on the sorption of these antibiotics in soil 60 the fqs residues in the food chain even at lower concentrations can lead to a potential risk to the consumers the translocation of the antibiotics from the soil to the edible part of the plant imparts a major risk to human health the phytotoxicity of the fqs was studied in vitro rather than under natural conditions the impact of fqs was seen on the plant growth and development and germination of seeds in roots the accumulation and sorption of nor and cip take place which then gets translocated above the ground 61 nor can get accumulated in the saline soil but no translocation was observed from roots to other parts of soybean migliore et al 62 reported that enr concentration 50 5000 μg l affects the length of leaves and modify the root length of the plants such as phaseolus vulgaris cucumis sativus and in triticum aestivum and brassica campestris l affects the root and shoot elongation in medicago sativa the lev concentration 1 10 000 μg l can cause the elongation of root 63 the chlorophyll content is reduced significantly in triticum aestivum l on exposure to cip 0 5 15 mg l the toxicity and photodegradation of cip doxycycline and oxytetracycline have been studied in the uv h202 and uv processes vibrio fischeri was used to evaluate the toxicity of the antibiotics during the uv photolysis when the parent compound structure was preserved the toxicity increased in the uv h202 process toxicity decreased when the non toxic products were formed by hydroxyl radical oxidation 64 at higher concentrations the fqs can cause toxic effects to invertebrate and vertebrate species the fqs can lead to convulsions inhibition of the gamma aminobutyric acid dysfunction of the reproductive organs and gastrointestinal problems arthropathy the excitement of the central nervous system and ocular problems 65 in carassius auratus goldfish exposure to fqs can result in damage to gonadal dna the aquatic organisms are also sensitive to fqs exposure for ex in the green algae desmodesmus subspicatus the ec50 was observed to be 8 042 mg l and has limited sensitivity to cip 66 in duckweed lemna minor yellowing of fronds was observed on exposure to cip and the ec50 was found to be 0 203 mg l 67 the toxicity of cip ofl enr lomefloxacin levofloxacin flumequine and clinafloxacin to the eukaryotic and prokaryotic aquatic organisms was studied the microcystis aeruginosa was sensitive to an even lower concentration of levofloxacin 0 0079 mg l daphnia magna when exposed to the antibiotic showed lethargic behavior and acute toxicity in pseudokirchneriella subcapitata commonly known as green algae high ec50 up to 120 mg l was observed cip exposure at a concentration higher than 12 5 mg l can cause a decrease in the growth and chlorophyll content of chlorella vulgaris also the increase in glutathione s transferase levels in the c vulgaris was observed in response to protect the cells also cip exposure can lead to a sharp increase in the activity of glutathione reductase glutathione peroxidase catalase superoxide dismutase the increase in enzyme activity is a result of induced oxidative stress 68 the effect of fqs was seen on the goldfish carassius auratus the nor can significantly decrease the acetylcholinesterase brain activity and superoxide dismutase activities were increased significantly after 7 days at 10 mg l of nor a significant increase in the serum vitellogenin levels was observed and at higher concentrations dna damage was seen ecotoxicological effects are seen on the tadpoles of xenopus spp teratogenic effects are seen on exposure to fqs 69 70 4 wwtps in the spread of fqs resistance wwtps are designed to minimize the concentration of pathogens and antibiotics 71 these wwtps receive hospital industrial and domestic waste and become a hotspot for the promotion of multi drug resistance in bacteria 72 the antibiotic resistant genes args are present in sediments groundwater wetlands and surface water 73 the antibiotics employed in livestock treatment and animal feed may also play a role in the development of resistance in bacteria the wwtps discharges into rivers sediments and irrigation leading to a high concentration of antibiotics along with the args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arbs even with no antibiotic pressure args can persist in the environment 74 the activated sludge system of the wwtps is a hotspot for the transfer of args the antibiotic resistance is promoted in the pathogenic bacteria by the spread of the args in allochthonous bacteria and horizontal gene transfer according to the reports of wang et al 75 quinolones along with macrolides trimethoprim and sulfonamides are the major class of antibiotics abundant in the effluent and influent wwtps in europe north america asia and africa beta lactams such as penicillin and cephalosporins are not abundant in the wwtps as they are easily hydrolyzed and do not have a stable structure tetracycline tet azithromycin sulfamethoxazole cip nor have stable structures and are frequently prescribed 75 tet and trimethoprim are most abundant in wwtp with a frequency of 80 followed by sulfamethoxazole 70 erythromycin 45 cip 40 and sulfamethazine 10 quinolones are widely used in the treatment of digestive urinary and respiratory tract infections a study reported by faleye et al 76 reported that the quinolones are present at high concentrations in the influent water of south africa the level of antibiotics treated effluent water and in raw sewage was studied between the years 1999 2019 and it was observed that the quinolones levels in the influent were eliminated by 15 8 from 2010 to 2019 as compared to 1999 2009 this is mainly attributed to the management and knowledge about the usage of antibiotics in recent years the quinolones were present at similar levels in the effluent also as compared to other antibiotics whose levels were lowered in the effluent this suggests that quinolones are frequently prescribed over the last 20 years as the broad spectrum antibiotic for the treatment of gram negative and gram positive bacteria 76 5 antibiotic removal in the wwtps the removal efficiency of antibiotics was also studied by wang et al 75 the quinolones along with beta lactams and lincomycin was removed up to 77 followed by tetracyclines whereas the sulfonamides macrolides and trimethoprim are recalcitrant to degradation so exhibit the lowest removal in wwtps the beta lactams get rapidly hydrolyzed via enzymatic and chemical hydrolysis quinolones get absorbed into the sewage sludge and have high sorption constant which can explain their highest removal 77 the removal efficiency depends on the structure of the antibiotics the conditions and the physicochemical properties of the antibiotics the main mechanisms for antibiotic removal in the wwtps are adsorption to sludge hydrolysis and biodegradation antibiotics are mainly non volatile as they have a high molecular weight 78 different biological treatment processes are important for antibiotic removal anoxic oxic a o processes and activated sludge are the main processes by which the removal takes place the removal efficiency of specific antibiotics is variable despite the use of the same process the municipal wastewater is a complex matrix and ph adjustment extraction reagent and matrix interference affects the accuracy of antibiotic detection the sludge retention time srt temperature and hydraulic retention time hrt also affects the removal efficiency higher removal of antibiotics is attributed to high temperature srt and hrt the seasonal variations also affect the removal for ex a study by zuccato et al 79 reported the removal of antibiotics in six wwtps adopting activated sludge removal in winters and summer in wwtps in italy and observed that the removal of sulfamethoxazole 71 and amoxicillin 100 is higher in summer as compared to winters 17 and 75 whereas in the case of cip and clindamycin similar removal was obtained 50 and 60 another study by golovko et al 80 showed the effect of srt hrt and temperature on the removal of 15 antibiotics and found that cip and clindamycin removal showed correlations with temperature and srt 80 the studies by behera et al 81 also showed that the conventional activated sludge process is less efficient than the activated sludge process with anoxic oxic conditions 81 all these studies on the removal of antibiotics in wwtps conclude that the antibiotics cannot be completely removed by the conventional wastewater treatment processes to reduce the risk of antibiotic contamination in the environment newer and more efficient technologies are employed for ex the adsorption process 82 fenton like oxidation 83 sulfate radical based oxidation 84 and ozonation 6 fqs induced resistance in bacteria extensive use of fqs has led to the increased resistance to antimicrobials bacterial resistance has emerged rapidly escherichia coli salmonella spp mycobacterium tuberculosis clostridium spp klebsiella pneumoniae staphylococcus aureus neisseria gonorrhea pseudomonas aeruginosa proteus mirabilis are reported to be resistant to fqs table 4 shows the quinolone resistance mechanism in bacteria initially the resistance was related to chromosomal mechanisms and mainly due to the alteration in the target site of the quinolones dn gyrase or type ii topoisomerases decrease in the permeability due to the modifications in the lipopolysaccharide and structural modifications of porins and due to the regulatory gene mutations 85 the chromosomal genes are involved in low level resistance mechanisms the genes for quinolones resistance are also present on plasmids and all the plasmids carry multiple resistance determinants 86 the plasmid heterogeneity contributes to the variety of hosts for plasmid mediated resistance to quinolones three different mechanisms have been associated with plasmid mediated quinolone resistance pmqr namely the drug modification acetylation of quinolones aac lb cr acetyltransferase qnr proteins and active efflux pumps qepa and oqxab pumps the pmqr genes are mainly related to the transposable or mobile elements present on plasmids and qnr genes are linked to the sul1 type integrons 85 these plasmid mediated mechanisms can offer only a low level of resistance to quinolones but when complemented with chromosomal resistance these mechanisms can reach the clinical resistance level aac lb cr acetyltransferase is a variant of the enzyme acetyltransferase with two amino acid changes trp102arg and asp179tyr and causes resistance to amikacin tobramycin kanamycin 87 the enzyme acetylates the amino n4 nitrogen of norfloxacin and cip and also acetylates other quinolones at the secondary nitrogen n4 on the piperazinyl substituent the asp179tyr substitution permits the ℼ stacking interaction with the quinolone ring and aids in the binding of quinolone and the trp102arg helps in the optimal interaction of the tyr face to carboxyl or keto groups quiroga et al 88 reported seven different alleles of aac lb cr conferring a similar level of resistance to quinolones and a 26 amino acid larger variant of aac lb cr with trp128arg and asp205tyr substitution 88 the qnr proteins are the members of the pentapeptide repeat prp family 89 and contain tandemly repeated amino acid sequences six major qnr families have been identified so far namely qnra qnrb qnrs qnrc qnrd and qnrvc qnra can bind to the dna gyrase holoenzyme gyra and gyrb subunits in the absence of cip atp and relaxed dna 90 the expression of qnr genes is regulated by environmental conditions the sos system is a natural tactic for bacteria against any kind of stress including the quinolones and aggression 91 the qnrb and qnrd variants contain a binding site for lexa in their promoter region lexa regulates the sos response to dna damage and cip is known to induce the sos system up to 9 fold 92 the transcription of qnrb or qnrd genes is induced by fqs beta lactams and trimethoprim qepa belongs to the major facilitator superfamily mfs transporters qepa aids in the elimination of hydrophilic fqs nor and cip from the cell by an active efflux mechanism leading to an increase in minimum inhibitory concentration mic 93 qep a shares significant amino acid sequences with putative membrane transporters of actinomycetales 94 qacbiii a variant of qacb plasmid mediated multidrug efflux pumps belonging to the mfs family confers the ability of cip and nor efflux on s aureus 95 oqxab belongs to the resistance nodulation cell division rnd family and functions as an efflux system 96 oqxab is specific for nor cip nalidixic acid and flumequine along with trimethoprim and chloramphenicol 97 in k pneumoniae the oqxab gene is present in both the plasmids and chromosome and up to a 20 fold variation of expression is observed in the chromosomal encoded gene the extended spectrum beta lactamases esbl producing k pneumoniae is a reservoir for the spread of these genes 98 overexpression of rara gene in k pneumoniae upregulates the oqxab efflux pump and oqxr downregulates the expression of the efflux pump szczepanowski et al 99 isolated a prsb101 plasmid resistant to multiple antibiotics residing in a phytopathogenic bacteria carrying an rnd type resistant determinant conferring resistance to nor and nalidixic acid from a wwtp 99 prsb101 is not related to qepa and oqxab a correlation is observed between the resistance to cip and the mutations associated alterations in subunits of topoisomerase ii gyra gyrb and subunits of topoisomerase iv parc and pare in p aeruginosa 100 mutations in the mara gene can lead to the activation of genes encoding the acrab tolc efflux pump which has a major role in the efflux of quinolone mutations in the mara gene can lead to the decreased translation of ompf outer membrane porin protein thus decreasing the influx of quinolone 101 mutations in the gene which encodes for the aminoglycoside n 6 acetyltransferase aac 6 lb leading to aminoglycoside resistance result in a variant aac 6 lb cr that promotes the resistance to nor and cip 102 the pum505 is a conjugative plasmid carrying the protein encoding genes for virulence dna repair metal resistance and plasmid stability 103 104 105 106 the plasmid also confers resistance to cip on p aeruginosa pu21 the pum505 plasmid when transferred into strain pu21 of p aeruginosa confers resistance to cip 107 pum505 encodes some factors which confer susceptibility to cip 106 the pum505 plasmid was transferred into p aeruginosa strain pao1 to determine the antibacterial susceptibility to other quinolones levofloxacin moxifloxacin nalidixic acid and nor the results showed that these antibiotics have a 4 fold higher mic for pum505 p aeruginosa pao1 as compared to the p aeruginosa receptor strain pao1 the results indicated that pum505 encodes a protein which provides resistant to quinolone in silico analysis was conducted to identify the molecular elements involved in fqs resistance by the plasmid pum505 and a 65 amino acid protein encoded by the crpp gene was identified which shared sequence homology with the proteins involved in antibiotic resistance crpp is a novel cip modifying enzyme encoded by the pum505 plasmid isolated from the clinical p aeruginosa isolate crpp displayed only 18 sequence identity to aph iib enzyme which confers streptomycin gentamicin and kanamycin resistance by the transfer of the phosphoryl group of atp to the 3 hydroxyl group present in these antibiotics aph iib enzyme is present in p aeruginosa m18 108 109 the enzymes contain conserved motifs at the c terminus responsible for the binding of the antibiotics and catalysis the n terminus contains the atp binding domain 109 however no such catalytic motifs are reported for crpp protein but it contains conserved catalytic residues 7 gly involved in catalysis and 26 ile involved in atp binding the c and n terminus sequences of the aph enzymes are different from the aph subfamilies 109 the crpp protein may confer antibiotic resistance but the variability in the sequence of proteins helps in substrate recognition the transfer of pum505 plasmid to pao1 strain conferred decrease susceptibility to cip nor moxifloxacin however the crpp gene presence did not lower the quinolone susceptibility of strain pao1 a possible reason is that the strain pao1 has intrinsic high resistance to several antibiotics 110 the pum505 plasmid might encode other genes in addition to the crpp gene and several resistance mechanisms that combined could enhance the resistance of pseudomonas to quinolones several pmqr elements such as efflux pump proteins qepa1 and qepa2 oqxab qnr proteins or the aac 6 lb cr enzyme could also confer decreased susceptibility to quinolones 7 degradation of fqs antibiotics are non biodegradable and highly persistent in the environment cip degrades very slowly and is persistent in soil for up to 4 months thus creating a micro environment for the antibiotic resistant bacterial strains in the soil matrix 111 cip is a second generation fq and is detected at high concentrations in wastewaters the unrestricted use of the cip has aggravated the increase of cip resistant bacteria the physical and chemical methods of degradation are expensive and inefficient for the decontamination of antibiotics 112 an alternative to these methods is the use of living organisms for antibiotic removal bioremediation is cost effective and involves the use of microorganisms for the breakdown of complex and toxic molecules into simpler and less or non toxic molecules 8 degradation of fqs using fungi and bacteria fungi and bacteria are used for the removal of antibiotics via biotransformation mineralization and biodegradation agrocybe praecox dichomitus squalens gloeophyllum striatum gloeophyllum trabeum irpex lacteus pleurotus ostreatus bjerkandera adusta clitocybe odora clitocybula dusenii are the fungal species that are involved in the degradation of cip bacteria and fungi are reported to transform cip with fungi offering certain advantages over bacteria in fqs degradation in the case of bacteria pre exposure to the pollutant is required to produce specific enzymes needed for the degradation 113 the wood rotting species of fungi can transform and degrade the fqs as their enzymes are non specific 114 the wood rotting fungus has a special enzyme arsenal that is non specific has low substrate specificity other extracellular enzymes such as ligninolytic enzymes laccase manganese peroxidase lignin peroxidase and intracellular enzymes such as monooxygenases and cytochrome p450 these enzymes aid fungi in the biotransformation of the pollutants extracellularly or intracellularly via oxidation reduction or conjugate formation the fungi have an amazing capability to transform antibiotics 115 the wastewater can be treated using fungi as compared to conventional wastewater treatment 116 pleurotus ostreatus is a basidiomycetous fungus the mycelium of the fungus is used for cip elimination the fungus can produce enzymes such as lignin peroxidases xylanases laccase manganese peroxide which are important for the degradation of xenobiotics 117 comparative study of five basidiomycetous white rot fungi used for the biotransformation of nor cip and ofloxacin the metabolites were formed by the modification of the piperazine ring and no change in the fqs aromatic ring was observed the processes include partial or complete decomposition formylation and acetylation the metabolites formed were n acetyl ciprofloxacin n formyl ciprofloxacin desethylene n formyl ciprofloxacin 7 despiperazinyl 7 aminociprofloxacin among others 118 trametes versicolor is reported to transform cip up to 90 in 7 days at the concentration of 2 mg l 119 cip metabolism using pestalotiopsis guepini yielded the most abundant metabolite n acetylciprofloxacin n aformylciprofloxacin among others 120 biotransformation of cip by pycnoporus sanguineus and phanerochaete chrysosporium white rot basidiomycetes resulted in up to 98 removal of cip in 2 days at 10 mg l 121 the transformation pathways proposed by the above study was the loss of fluorine atom the fungus present in soil trichoderma viride transforms the cip to 4 hydroxy 3 oxo 4 vinylcyclopent 1 enyl ciprofloxacin a study by feng et al 122 showed that the single microorganism cannot bio transform cip consortia of microorganisms ex in non activated sludge are used in the biotransformation of cip 122 the biotransformation of fq was studied using activated sludge from municipal wwtp in a membrane bioreactor 123 the cip degradation yields a 7 2 carboxymethyl amino substituent at c7 7 carboxymethyl amino 1cyclopropyl 6 fluoro 4 oxo 1 4 dihydroquinoline 3 carboxylic acid formed via the decomposition of the piperazine moiety and n succinyl ciprofloxacin formed via n succinylation all these products were identified using mass spectrometry the elimination of cip was also studied by non pathogenic cip resistant strains which were isolated from hospital effluent water the strains were bacillus sp enterobacter lactobacillus gasseri and could remove 74 96 and 100 of cip at 5 mg l of cip in 14 days 124 the cip elimination was confirmed in this case by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy which examined the structural changes in the quinolone moiety and piperazine ring one of the studies by liao et al 125 reported the use of mixed culture isolated from drinking water biofilter acclimatized to high cip concentrations high removal 89 was observed in mixed cultures in 28 days the mixed bacterial community was dominated by stenotrophomonas pseudoxanthomonas dysgonomonas phenylobacterium leucobacter and ferruginibacter 125 the xylaria longipes soft rot ascomycete can transform cip into four metabolites which can be identified by nmr and ms experiments 30 degradation of cip was also checked by a mixture of desulfobacter sp in an anaerobic sulfate reducing bacteria sludge system hydroxylation and desethylation of the piperazine substituent are the major degradation reaction that took place 126 the cip is reported to be degraded by bacillus sp bradyrhizobium sp enterobacter sp escherichia coli labrys portucalensis lactobacillus gasseri mycobacterium frederiksbergense mycobacterium gilvum mycobacterium smegmatis rhodococcus sp 30 several mycobacterium strains are reported in the biotransformation of cip and the metabolites such as n nitroso ciprofloxacin are formed in the degradation studies 127 the cip removal was studied by a thermus sp a thermophilic bacterium isolated from a pharmaceutical sludge enriched with cip 128 biotransformation reaction involves the succinylation nitrosation acetylation and formylation and cleavage of the piperazine ring either partially or completely conjugate formation occurred and the modification of the fqs core structure was observed using hydroxylation defluorination and decarboxylation 9 plants in the removal of cip the sewage sludge that contains antibiotics is used as a fertilizer in fields 129 antibiotics reach the soil matrices get accumulated in plants and affect the microorganisms growth promoters used in animal husbandry reach the manure in the original form or as metabolites and ultimately to fields high antibiotics concentration gets accumulated in the soil and strongly influences the plants and microorganisms antibiotics and metabolites reach the soil and get mineralized by soil microbes or enter the groundwater the fqs adsorption depends on the plant species and its spiking concentration the lower the level of fqs concentration in the soil the higher is the adsorption rate in lettuce the cip adsorption was 90 100 cucumber 70 100 barley 64 100 130 10 phytoremediation of cip vetiver grass is used in the phytoremediation of antibiotics vetiver grass can tolerate inorganic and organic pollutants a study by panja et al 131 showed the ability of vetiver grass in the removal of cip from aquatic media with a major aim for the development of the plant based method for the treatment of wastewater 131 the transformation and elimination of cip were evaluated in the study in 30 days 80 of cip was removed and transformation products of cip in the tissues of vetiver indicated the potential role of root associated microbes in the metabolism of plants and degradation of cip a study by sodhi et al 25 showed the cip removal in hoagland media by eichhornia crassipes and showed 78 removal of cip and enhanced removal was observed in the by microbacterium sp whc1 in the presence of plant root exudates 25 table 5 summarizes the removal of cip by the living organisms existing literature shows a limitation in the use of biological methods in the removal of antibiotics for the effective removal of antibiotics modifications and recent advancements are made in the physicochemical methods 11 recent strategies in the cip removal 11 1 cip removal using modified advanced oxidation processes aops aops include technologies such as hydrogen peroxide h202 fenton fe ii h2o2 ultraviolet radiation uv and ozone o3 133 the ozonation of fqs was performed by liu et al 134 2 mg l of o3 led to 100 removal efficiency ozonation is effective in the decontamination of the contaminants from the effluents of wastewater but can lead to sore throat headaches and nose and eye irritation 134 water containing bromite can react with residual ozone to form carcinogenic bromate 135 fenton process is a slow process and ph needs to be adjusted and is not economical the quinolones degradation using zinc hydroxide chloride monohydrate nanoplates and zinc oxide nanoparticles for the cip removal achieved 91 66 and 95 35 of cip in 60 min at ph 8 136 the electrocoagulation is used with pure iron electrodes and 86 6 of cip was removed in 10 min at ph 4 137 electrocoagulation using aluminium electrodes achieved 88 57 cip in 20 min at ph 7 78 138 activated carbon from desilicated rice husk could absorb 0 787 mg of cip in 306 9 min 139 photocatalysis is advantageous as it has ambient temperature and pressure requirements and utilizes oxygen as an oxidant and solar radiation as an energy source economical and durable process having strong redox ability and no saturation due to adsorption and provides a complete decomposition of the organic molecule into inorganic molecules 140 11 2 cip removal by nanohybrid go o cnts nanohybrid adsorbents go o cnts were synthesized these adsorbents were composed of graphene oxide go cross linked via calcium ions ca2 and have oxidized carbon nanotubes ocnts in water and dispersed in tween 80 solution these adsorbents were characterized using infrared radiation scanning electron micrography thermogravimetric analysis and x ray diffraction studies optimum conditions such as ph of the solution the temperature of the solution nanohybrid mass contact time cross linking agent and go o cnt ratio 99 2 of cip was removed with the uptake of 512 mg g cip removal dynamics showed a pseudo second order reaction and displayed intraparticle diffusion thermodynamic parameters revealed that cip is a simple desorption process 141 11 3 adsorptive removal of cip using protein modified nanosilica promns moringa seeds were used for the extraction of protein and rice husk was used for the synthesis of nanosilica ft ir and high performance liquid chromatography were used to characterize the protein the protein adsorption onto nano silica was studied at different ionic strengths and ph the cip removal was significantly increased on the modification of the nano silica surface with protein promns assisted cip removal was effective and optimized at the adsorption dose of 10 mg ml time 90 min ionic strength 1 mm kcl and ph 7 the maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 85 mg g the adsorption capacity decreased with increasing ionic strength of kcl which suggests that the adsorption of cip onto promns is via electrostatic attraction between anionic species in cip and cationic species of promns 70 of cip removal was seen from the hospital wastewater promns is a new eco friendly adsorbent based method for the removal of antibiotics from aqueous solutions 142 11 4 cip removal by porous graphene hydrogel graphene is s new two dimensional 2d nano material having high mobility chemical stability and mechanical strength it is used as a high performance adsorbent as it has a large surface area but the surface area decreases on aggregation during the reduction process as a result the 2d graphene sheets have a limited use over the years the problem is solved by the synthesis of a three dimensional 3d porous graphene hydrogel gh as an adsorbent this method is the eco friendly and efficient hydrothermal method of reduction the gh granules were characterized using tem brunauer emmett teller bet method and xrd gh granules showed excellent cip adsorption capacity 235 6 mg g adsorption mechanisms include hydrogen bonding hydrophobic and π π eda interaction decreasing the size of hydrogels can significantly increase the cip removal and adsorption process 143 water was present in more than 99 by wt of hydrogels and has a key role in the adsorption process the gh granules have a promising role in the removal of the antibiotic from aqueous solutions 144 12 conclusions the antibiotics and the resistant genes are released into the ecosystem which has led to antibiotic pollution in the environment the antibiotics have a dreadful impact on the non target bacteria and disrupt their ecological functions they can either cause inhibition or disappearance of bacterial groups i e they can either have a bactericidal or bacteriostatic effect or can confer resistance in the bacteria by generating phenotypic and genetic variability both physicochemical and biological treatment has been used to control bacterial resistance although complete removal is not feasible the fungi and bacteria are shown to be impressive in their capability to degrade and transform cip however biotransformation of antibiotics is seen the antibiotics exert their effect on non target organisms also pharmaceuticals have adverse consequences on living beings harmful effects are seen on plants animals and microorganisms therefore a more comprehensive understanding of the potential threats caused by these antibiotics on the environment is required advance studies should be conducted for estimating the effectiveness of the bioremediation of antibiotics the mechanisms which infer antimicrobial resistance should be studied in depth funding this study was supported by the funding agency

13331,the presence of antibiotics in wastewater domestic water and sewage has been found to produce ecotoxicological effects on living beings fluoroquinolones fqs are recognized as critically important and highly prioritized antimicrobial and are frequently used in veterinary and human medicine the recalcitrance of these antibiotics along with their poor metabolism has led to their detection in manures and wastewater ciprofloxacin cip is a synthetic and commonly prescribed fq and the metabolite of enrofloxacin the veterinary drug cip has negative effects on the flora and fauna due to the emergence of bacterial resistance against fqs special attention is given to the environmental degradation of these antibiotics by microorganisms physicochemical processes and bioremediation are employed for the removal of cip but the lipophilic and hydrophobic nature of the antibiotics acts as a hindrance to their complete removal from the environment the present review gives an insight into the sources of fqs in the environment their detection and their impact on living beings cip removal is being paid special attention and recent trends in its removal are discussed graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords antibiotics fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin resistance bioremediation 1 introduction antibiotics are one of the greatest advancements in the field of medicine and they have been employed for the treatment of a wide range of illnesses and for promoting animal growth the antibiotics are partially absorbed by the system and a considerable fraction is excreted either in its original form or metabolized form therefore the use of animal excreta in agriculture can act as one of the major routes of the entry of antibiotics into the environmental matrices 1 the entry of antibiotics into the aquatic environment at lower concentrations poses a long term risk to aquatic organisms 2 excessive usage of antibiotics has resulted in antibiotic pollution in the environment and these polluted sites act as hotspots for the spread of antibiotic resistance in environmental bacteria the subinhibitory concentration of the antibiotics exerts selective pressure on microbes driving the evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria 3 among the antibiotics fqs are of interest since they have been increasingly used in households hospitals and veterinary applications 4 in biological treatment plants more than 70 of cip and norfloxacin nor gets adsorbed on the sludge surface as sludge is an accumulator of the antibiotics the contaminated sludge is used as biosolids in agricultural fields owing to the multitude of hazards 5 fqs are used worldwide in veterinary and human medicine they are the third largest class of antibiotics up to 70 of the fqs are excreted in an unmetabolized form which promotes resistance in microbial populations fqs are recalcitrant to degradation and have high adsorption affinities which result in their persistent nature and have a reported half life up to 580 days in soil and 10 6 days in surface water 6 over the last few years the fqs are detected frequently in wastewater but there were no reports which showed their degradation in the conventional wwtps the quinolone emergence was accidental as a by product of an antimalarial agent chloroquine nalidixic acid is the first quinolone to be discovered and showed antibacterial activity against enterobacteria 7 nalidixic acid is used in the treatment of simple urinary tract infections only later other quinolones were synthesized which broaden the antibacterial spectrum of these drugs different functional groups are introduced into the structure of quinolone which gives new compounds with better pharmacokinetics a wide spectrum of action high stability and less toxicity 8 table 1 shows the development of quinolone antibiotic generations fqs are eliminated via renal excretion and hepatic metabolism fqs get only partially metabolized in the liver and excreted via urine and bile cip is excreted in urine 65 and feces 25 23 quinolones are used in the treatment of both gram positive and gram negative bacterium the latest generation is active against anaerobic bacteria and bacteria which are resistant to sulfonamides and beta lactams nor and ofloxacin are used as both human and veterinary medicine whereas danofloxacin marbofloxacin enrofloxacin and sarafloxacin are used are veterinary medicine and cip is used as a human medicine only 24 cip is a second generation fq that is frequently detected in the effluents of wastewater treatment plants wwtps soils surface water and groundwater 25 cip is active against a wide range of bacteria and is used in the treatment of bacterial infections table 2 shows the cip detection using various analytical techniques it acts by inhibiting the bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid dna replication while interacting with the topoisomerase ii dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv in bacteria 30 mainly the broad spectrum activity of the fqs is due to the binding of the topoisomerase on the ketone and carboxyl group the high antibacterial activity of the fqs is due to the presence of fluorine at the 6th position substitutions at ethyl cyclopropyl and fluorophenyl position and piperazine ring can have an impact on the biological activity 31 cip is one of the most widely used fqs in human medicines 32 it is one of the main metabolites of enrofloxacin enr enr is n deethylated in animals which results in active cip showing enhanced antimicrobial activity 33 cip presence has been detected in environmental matrices such as soil 34 sediment 35 surface water wastewater 36 and manure 37 according to the reports of gonzales martinez 38 cip has an impact on the community structure of the microbes and their catabolic diversity 2 sources of fqs in the environment animal manure wwtp effluent biosolids contaminated with fqs are potential reservoirs of the antibiotics the mobility of the fqs in the water depends on the solubility the solubility of 1 g l is said to be hydrophilic and resistant to hydrolysis 39 the water solubility of the cip is 30 g l and enr is 130 g l 40 fqs enter the environment via both veterinary and human waste waste streams that originate from the hospitals animal farms and residential areas contain the fqs antibiotic fqs are partially metabolized so their excretion ratio ranges between 30 for norfloxacin nor and 70 for ofloxacin ofl 41 however enrofloxacin enr is metabolized completely into cip by de ethylation 42 the human application can result in fqs pollution the disposal of unused antibiotics into the environment and the discharge of effluent water containing fqs can cause pollution hospital wastewater contains the fqs which are used as human medicines in the range of 3 ng l to 240 μg l mainly cip ofl and nor are detected in hospital waste 43 the fqs concentration in the hospital wastewater is 30 times higher than in urban wastewater waste from livestock applications can also lead to fqs pollution in the environment enr ofl nor and cip are reported to be present in the range of 63 ng l to 585 ng l fqs are reported in manure in the concentration of up to 1 4 g kg 1 43 the data of fqs concentrations in aquaculture is scarce nor and ofl is reported to be present in the effluent water from breeding farms and fish nurseries 44 aquaculture is one of the most important sources of antibiotics the bohai bay in north china is an important source of antibiotics 45 table 3 shows the distribution of fqs all around the world fqs is present in a huge concentration in manure as it is not metabolized or absorbed in vivo in the chickens and livestock animals 55 3 ecotoxicity of fqs and its impact on living organisms ecotoxicological data are available for less than 1 of the drugs antibiotics are designed to act on specific tissues or organs or target a specific molecular or metabolic pathway but it affects non target organisms also fqs and their metabolites are highly toxic to algae plants bacteria crustaceans and fishes 56 the fqs compounds exert ecological effects on the soil microbial communities 57 the negative impacts of fqs include the ecotoxicological effects decrease in the microbial diversity growth inhibition and bleaching of leaves along with an increase in mortality freshwater sediments are also affected by the fqs the microbial community changes with repeated exposure to cip 58 ec50 or effective concentration defines the antibiotic potency and is the concentration of the antibiotic producing half of a maximal effect the fqs continuous discharge into the surface water creates toxic conditions for the aquatic biota cyanobacteria have ec50 0 005 0 465 mg l which make it the most sensitive organism to fqs whereas the ec50 of algae and plants reach up to 38 5 mg l for the environmental risk assessment the hazard quotient hq is calculated which is expressed by the measured environmental concentration mec divided by the predicted no effect concentration pnec 59 the fqs toxicity varies in different species and is mainly dependent on the sorption of these antibiotics in soil 60 the fqs residues in the food chain even at lower concentrations can lead to a potential risk to the consumers the translocation of the antibiotics from the soil to the edible part of the plant imparts a major risk to human health the phytotoxicity of the fqs was studied in vitro rather than under natural conditions the impact of fqs was seen on the plant growth and development and germination of seeds in roots the accumulation and sorption of nor and cip take place which then gets translocated above the ground 61 nor can get accumulated in the saline soil but no translocation was observed from roots to other parts of soybean migliore et al 62 reported that enr concentration 50 5000 μg l affects the length of leaves and modify the root length of the plants such as phaseolus vulgaris cucumis sativus and in triticum aestivum and brassica campestris l affects the root and shoot elongation in medicago sativa the lev concentration 1 10 000 μg l can cause the elongation of root 63 the chlorophyll content is reduced significantly in triticum aestivum l on exposure to cip 0 5 15 mg l the toxicity and photodegradation of cip doxycycline and oxytetracycline have been studied in the uv h202 and uv processes vibrio fischeri was used to evaluate the toxicity of the antibiotics during the uv photolysis when the parent compound structure was preserved the toxicity increased in the uv h202 process toxicity decreased when the non toxic products were formed by hydroxyl radical oxidation 64 at higher concentrations the fqs can cause toxic effects to invertebrate and vertebrate species the fqs can lead to convulsions inhibition of the gamma aminobutyric acid dysfunction of the reproductive organs and gastrointestinal problems arthropathy the excitement of the central nervous system and ocular problems 65 in carassius auratus goldfish exposure to fqs can result in damage to gonadal dna the aquatic organisms are also sensitive to fqs exposure for ex in the green algae desmodesmus subspicatus the ec50 was observed to be 8 042 mg l and has limited sensitivity to cip 66 in duckweed lemna minor yellowing of fronds was observed on exposure to cip and the ec50 was found to be 0 203 mg l 67 the toxicity of cip ofl enr lomefloxacin levofloxacin flumequine and clinafloxacin to the eukaryotic and prokaryotic aquatic organisms was studied the microcystis aeruginosa was sensitive to an even lower concentration of levofloxacin 0 0079 mg l daphnia magna when exposed to the antibiotic showed lethargic behavior and acute toxicity in pseudokirchneriella subcapitata commonly known as green algae high ec50 up to 120 mg l was observed cip exposure at a concentration higher than 12 5 mg l can cause a decrease in the growth and chlorophyll content of chlorella vulgaris also the increase in glutathione s transferase levels in the c vulgaris was observed in response to protect the cells also cip exposure can lead to a sharp increase in the activity of glutathione reductase glutathione peroxidase catalase superoxide dismutase the increase in enzyme activity is a result of induced oxidative stress 68 the effect of fqs was seen on the goldfish carassius auratus the nor can significantly decrease the acetylcholinesterase brain activity and superoxide dismutase activities were increased significantly after 7 days at 10 mg l of nor a significant increase in the serum vitellogenin levels was observed and at higher concentrations dna damage was seen ecotoxicological effects are seen on the tadpoles of xenopus spp teratogenic effects are seen on exposure to fqs 69 70 4 wwtps in the spread of fqs resistance wwtps are designed to minimize the concentration of pathogens and antibiotics 71 these wwtps receive hospital industrial and domestic waste and become a hotspot for the promotion of multi drug resistance in bacteria 72 the antibiotic resistant genes args are present in sediments groundwater wetlands and surface water 73 the antibiotics employed in livestock treatment and animal feed may also play a role in the development of resistance in bacteria the wwtps discharges into rivers sediments and irrigation leading to a high concentration of antibiotics along with the args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arbs even with no antibiotic pressure args can persist in the environment 74 the activated sludge system of the wwtps is a hotspot for the transfer of args the antibiotic resistance is promoted in the pathogenic bacteria by the spread of the args in allochthonous bacteria and horizontal gene transfer according to the reports of wang et al 75 quinolones along with macrolides trimethoprim and sulfonamides are the major class of antibiotics abundant in the effluent and influent wwtps in europe north america asia and africa beta lactams such as penicillin and cephalosporins are not abundant in the wwtps as they are easily hydrolyzed and do not have a stable structure tetracycline tet azithromycin sulfamethoxazole cip nor have stable structures and are frequently prescribed 75 tet and trimethoprim are most abundant in wwtp with a frequency of 80 followed by sulfamethoxazole 70 erythromycin 45 cip 40 and sulfamethazine 10 quinolones are widely used in the treatment of digestive urinary and respiratory tract infections a study reported by faleye et al 76 reported that the quinolones are present at high concentrations in the influent water of south africa the level of antibiotics treated effluent water and in raw sewage was studied between the years 1999 2019 and it was observed that the quinolones levels in the influent were eliminated by 15 8 from 2010 to 2019 as compared to 1999 2009 this is mainly attributed to the management and knowledge about the usage of antibiotics in recent years the quinolones were present at similar levels in the effluent also as compared to other antibiotics whose levels were lowered in the effluent this suggests that quinolones are frequently prescribed over the last 20 years as the broad spectrum antibiotic for the treatment of gram negative and gram positive bacteria 76 5 antibiotic removal in the wwtps the removal efficiency of antibiotics was also studied by wang et al 75 the quinolones along with beta lactams and lincomycin was removed up to 77 followed by tetracyclines whereas the sulfonamides macrolides and trimethoprim are recalcitrant to degradation so exhibit the lowest removal in wwtps the beta lactams get rapidly hydrolyzed via enzymatic and chemical hydrolysis quinolones get absorbed into the sewage sludge and have high sorption constant which can explain their highest removal 77 the removal efficiency depends on the structure of the antibiotics the conditions and the physicochemical properties of the antibiotics the main mechanisms for antibiotic removal in the wwtps are adsorption to sludge hydrolysis and biodegradation antibiotics are mainly non volatile as they have a high molecular weight 78 different biological treatment processes are important for antibiotic removal anoxic oxic a o processes and activated sludge are the main processes by which the removal takes place the removal efficiency of specific antibiotics is variable despite the use of the same process the municipal wastewater is a complex matrix and ph adjustment extraction reagent and matrix interference affects the accuracy of antibiotic detection the sludge retention time srt temperature and hydraulic retention time hrt also affects the removal efficiency higher removal of antibiotics is attributed to high temperature srt and hrt the seasonal variations also affect the removal for ex a study by zuccato et al 79 reported the removal of antibiotics in six wwtps adopting activated sludge removal in winters and summer in wwtps in italy and observed that the removal of sulfamethoxazole 71 and amoxicillin 100 is higher in summer as compared to winters 17 and 75 whereas in the case of cip and clindamycin similar removal was obtained 50 and 60 another study by golovko et al 80 showed the effect of srt hrt and temperature on the removal of 15 antibiotics and found that cip and clindamycin removal showed correlations with temperature and srt 80 the studies by behera et al 81 also showed that the conventional activated sludge process is less efficient than the activated sludge process with anoxic oxic conditions 81 all these studies on the removal of antibiotics in wwtps conclude that the antibiotics cannot be completely removed by the conventional wastewater treatment processes to reduce the risk of antibiotic contamination in the environment newer and more efficient technologies are employed for ex the adsorption process 82 fenton like oxidation 83 sulfate radical based oxidation 84 and ozonation 6 fqs induced resistance in bacteria extensive use of fqs has led to the increased resistance to antimicrobials bacterial resistance has emerged rapidly escherichia coli salmonella spp mycobacterium tuberculosis clostridium spp klebsiella pneumoniae staphylococcus aureus neisseria gonorrhea pseudomonas aeruginosa proteus mirabilis are reported to be resistant to fqs table 4 shows the quinolone resistance mechanism in bacteria initially the resistance was related to chromosomal mechanisms and mainly due to the alteration in the target site of the quinolones dn gyrase or type ii topoisomerases decrease in the permeability due to the modifications in the lipopolysaccharide and structural modifications of porins and due to the regulatory gene mutations 85 the chromosomal genes are involved in low level resistance mechanisms the genes for quinolones resistance are also present on plasmids and all the plasmids carry multiple resistance determinants 86 the plasmid heterogeneity contributes to the variety of hosts for plasmid mediated resistance to quinolones three different mechanisms have been associated with plasmid mediated quinolone resistance pmqr namely the drug modification acetylation of quinolones aac lb cr acetyltransferase qnr proteins and active efflux pumps qepa and oqxab pumps the pmqr genes are mainly related to the transposable or mobile elements present on plasmids and qnr genes are linked to the sul1 type integrons 85 these plasmid mediated mechanisms can offer only a low level of resistance to quinolones but when complemented with chromosomal resistance these mechanisms can reach the clinical resistance level aac lb cr acetyltransferase is a variant of the enzyme acetyltransferase with two amino acid changes trp102arg and asp179tyr and causes resistance to amikacin tobramycin kanamycin 87 the enzyme acetylates the amino n4 nitrogen of norfloxacin and cip and also acetylates other quinolones at the secondary nitrogen n4 on the piperazinyl substituent the asp179tyr substitution permits the ℼ stacking interaction with the quinolone ring and aids in the binding of quinolone and the trp102arg helps in the optimal interaction of the tyr face to carboxyl or keto groups quiroga et al 88 reported seven different alleles of aac lb cr conferring a similar level of resistance to quinolones and a 26 amino acid larger variant of aac lb cr with trp128arg and asp205tyr substitution 88 the qnr proteins are the members of the pentapeptide repeat prp family 89 and contain tandemly repeated amino acid sequences six major qnr families have been identified so far namely qnra qnrb qnrs qnrc qnrd and qnrvc qnra can bind to the dna gyrase holoenzyme gyra and gyrb subunits in the absence of cip atp and relaxed dna 90 the expression of qnr genes is regulated by environmental conditions the sos system is a natural tactic for bacteria against any kind of stress including the quinolones and aggression 91 the qnrb and qnrd variants contain a binding site for lexa in their promoter region lexa regulates the sos response to dna damage and cip is known to induce the sos system up to 9 fold 92 the transcription of qnrb or qnrd genes is induced by fqs beta lactams and trimethoprim qepa belongs to the major facilitator superfamily mfs transporters qepa aids in the elimination of hydrophilic fqs nor and cip from the cell by an active efflux mechanism leading to an increase in minimum inhibitory concentration mic 93 qep a shares significant amino acid sequences with putative membrane transporters of actinomycetales 94 qacbiii a variant of qacb plasmid mediated multidrug efflux pumps belonging to the mfs family confers the ability of cip and nor efflux on s aureus 95 oqxab belongs to the resistance nodulation cell division rnd family and functions as an efflux system 96 oqxab is specific for nor cip nalidixic acid and flumequine along with trimethoprim and chloramphenicol 97 in k pneumoniae the oqxab gene is present in both the plasmids and chromosome and up to a 20 fold variation of expression is observed in the chromosomal encoded gene the extended spectrum beta lactamases esbl producing k pneumoniae is a reservoir for the spread of these genes 98 overexpression of rara gene in k pneumoniae upregulates the oqxab efflux pump and oqxr downregulates the expression of the efflux pump szczepanowski et al 99 isolated a prsb101 plasmid resistant to multiple antibiotics residing in a phytopathogenic bacteria carrying an rnd type resistant determinant conferring resistance to nor and nalidixic acid from a wwtp 99 prsb101 is not related to qepa and oqxab a correlation is observed between the resistance to cip and the mutations associated alterations in subunits of topoisomerase ii gyra gyrb and subunits of topoisomerase iv parc and pare in p aeruginosa 100 mutations in the mara gene can lead to the activation of genes encoding the acrab tolc efflux pump which has a major role in the efflux of quinolone mutations in the mara gene can lead to the decreased translation of ompf outer membrane porin protein thus decreasing the influx of quinolone 101 mutations in the gene which encodes for the aminoglycoside n 6 acetyltransferase aac 6 lb leading to aminoglycoside resistance result in a variant aac 6 lb cr that promotes the resistance to nor and cip 102 the pum505 is a conjugative plasmid carrying the protein encoding genes for virulence dna repair metal resistance and plasmid stability 103 104 105 106 the plasmid also confers resistance to cip on p aeruginosa pu21 the pum505 plasmid when transferred into strain pu21 of p aeruginosa confers resistance to cip 107 pum505 encodes some factors which confer susceptibility to cip 106 the pum505 plasmid was transferred into p aeruginosa strain pao1 to determine the antibacterial susceptibility to other quinolones levofloxacin moxifloxacin nalidixic acid and nor the results showed that these antibiotics have a 4 fold higher mic for pum505 p aeruginosa pao1 as compared to the p aeruginosa receptor strain pao1 the results indicated that pum505 encodes a protein which provides resistant to quinolone in silico analysis was conducted to identify the molecular elements involved in fqs resistance by the plasmid pum505 and a 65 amino acid protein encoded by the crpp gene was identified which shared sequence homology with the proteins involved in antibiotic resistance crpp is a novel cip modifying enzyme encoded by the pum505 plasmid isolated from the clinical p aeruginosa isolate crpp displayed only 18 sequence identity to aph iib enzyme which confers streptomycin gentamicin and kanamycin resistance by the transfer of the phosphoryl group of atp to the 3 hydroxyl group present in these antibiotics aph iib enzyme is present in p aeruginosa m18 108 109 the enzymes contain conserved motifs at the c terminus responsible for the binding of the antibiotics and catalysis the n terminus contains the atp binding domain 109 however no such catalytic motifs are reported for crpp protein but it contains conserved catalytic residues 7 gly involved in catalysis and 26 ile involved in atp binding the c and n terminus sequences of the aph enzymes are different from the aph subfamilies 109 the crpp protein may confer antibiotic resistance but the variability in the sequence of proteins helps in substrate recognition the transfer of pum505 plasmid to pao1 strain conferred decrease susceptibility to cip nor moxifloxacin however the crpp gene presence did not lower the quinolone susceptibility of strain pao1 a possible reason is that the strain pao1 has intrinsic high resistance to several antibiotics 110 the pum505 plasmid might encode other genes in addition to the crpp gene and several resistance mechanisms that combined could enhance the resistance of pseudomonas to quinolones several pmqr elements such as efflux pump proteins qepa1 and qepa2 oqxab qnr proteins or the aac 6 lb cr enzyme could also confer decreased susceptibility to quinolones 7 degradation of fqs antibiotics are non biodegradable and highly persistent in the environment cip degrades very slowly and is persistent in soil for up to 4 months thus creating a micro environment for the antibiotic resistant bacterial strains in the soil matrix 111 cip is a second generation fq and is detected at high concentrations in wastewaters the unrestricted use of the cip has aggravated the increase of cip resistant bacteria the physical and chemical methods of degradation are expensive and inefficient for the decontamination of antibiotics 112 an alternative to these methods is the use of living organisms for antibiotic removal bioremediation is cost effective and involves the use of microorganisms for the breakdown of complex and toxic molecules into simpler and less or non toxic molecules 8 degradation of fqs using fungi and bacteria fungi and bacteria are used for the removal of antibiotics via biotransformation mineralization and biodegradation agrocybe praecox dichomitus squalens gloeophyllum striatum gloeophyllum trabeum irpex lacteus pleurotus ostreatus bjerkandera adusta clitocybe odora clitocybula dusenii are the fungal species that are involved in the degradation of cip bacteria and fungi are reported to transform cip with fungi offering certain advantages over bacteria in fqs degradation in the case of bacteria pre exposure to the pollutant is required to produce specific enzymes needed for the degradation 113 the wood rotting species of fungi can transform and degrade the fqs as their enzymes are non specific 114 the wood rotting fungus has a special enzyme arsenal that is non specific has low substrate specificity other extracellular enzymes such as ligninolytic enzymes laccase manganese peroxidase lignin peroxidase and intracellular enzymes such as monooxygenases and cytochrome p450 these enzymes aid fungi in the biotransformation of the pollutants extracellularly or intracellularly via oxidation reduction or conjugate formation the fungi have an amazing capability to transform antibiotics 115 the wastewater can be treated using fungi as compared to conventional wastewater treatment 116 pleurotus ostreatus is a basidiomycetous fungus the mycelium of the fungus is used for cip elimination the fungus can produce enzymes such as lignin peroxidases xylanases laccase manganese peroxide which are important for the degradation of xenobiotics 117 comparative study of five basidiomycetous white rot fungi used for the biotransformation of nor cip and ofloxacin the metabolites were formed by the modification of the piperazine ring and no change in the fqs aromatic ring was observed the processes include partial or complete decomposition formylation and acetylation the metabolites formed were n acetyl ciprofloxacin n formyl ciprofloxacin desethylene n formyl ciprofloxacin 7 despiperazinyl 7 aminociprofloxacin among others 118 trametes versicolor is reported to transform cip up to 90 in 7 days at the concentration of 2 mg l 119 cip metabolism using pestalotiopsis guepini yielded the most abundant metabolite n acetylciprofloxacin n aformylciprofloxacin among others 120 biotransformation of cip by pycnoporus sanguineus and phanerochaete chrysosporium white rot basidiomycetes resulted in up to 98 removal of cip in 2 days at 10 mg l 121 the transformation pathways proposed by the above study was the loss of fluorine atom the fungus present in soil trichoderma viride transforms the cip to 4 hydroxy 3 oxo 4 vinylcyclopent 1 enyl ciprofloxacin a study by feng et al 122 showed that the single microorganism cannot bio transform cip consortia of microorganisms ex in non activated sludge are used in the biotransformation of cip 122 the biotransformation of fq was studied using activated sludge from municipal wwtp in a membrane bioreactor 123 the cip degradation yields a 7 2 carboxymethyl amino substituent at c7 7 carboxymethyl amino 1cyclopropyl 6 fluoro 4 oxo 1 4 dihydroquinoline 3 carboxylic acid formed via the decomposition of the piperazine moiety and n succinyl ciprofloxacin formed via n succinylation all these products were identified using mass spectrometry the elimination of cip was also studied by non pathogenic cip resistant strains which were isolated from hospital effluent water the strains were bacillus sp enterobacter lactobacillus gasseri and could remove 74 96 and 100 of cip at 5 mg l of cip in 14 days 124 the cip elimination was confirmed in this case by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy which examined the structural changes in the quinolone moiety and piperazine ring one of the studies by liao et al 125 reported the use of mixed culture isolated from drinking water biofilter acclimatized to high cip concentrations high removal 89 was observed in mixed cultures in 28 days the mixed bacterial community was dominated by stenotrophomonas pseudoxanthomonas dysgonomonas phenylobacterium leucobacter and ferruginibacter 125 the xylaria longipes soft rot ascomycete can transform cip into four metabolites which can be identified by nmr and ms experiments 30 degradation of cip was also checked by a mixture of desulfobacter sp in an anaerobic sulfate reducing bacteria sludge system hydroxylation and desethylation of the piperazine substituent are the major degradation reaction that took place 126 the cip is reported to be degraded by bacillus sp bradyrhizobium sp enterobacter sp escherichia coli labrys portucalensis lactobacillus gasseri mycobacterium frederiksbergense mycobacterium gilvum mycobacterium smegmatis rhodococcus sp 30 several mycobacterium strains are reported in the biotransformation of cip and the metabolites such as n nitroso ciprofloxacin are formed in the degradation studies 127 the cip removal was studied by a thermus sp a thermophilic bacterium isolated from a pharmaceutical sludge enriched with cip 128 biotransformation reaction involves the succinylation nitrosation acetylation and formylation and cleavage of the piperazine ring either partially or completely conjugate formation occurred and the modification of the fqs core structure was observed using hydroxylation defluorination and decarboxylation 9 plants in the removal of cip the sewage sludge that contains antibiotics is used as a fertilizer in fields 129 antibiotics reach the soil matrices get accumulated in plants and affect the microorganisms growth promoters used in animal husbandry reach the manure in the original form or as metabolites and ultimately to fields high antibiotics concentration gets accumulated in the soil and strongly influences the plants and microorganisms antibiotics and metabolites reach the soil and get mineralized by soil microbes or enter the groundwater the fqs adsorption depends on the plant species and its spiking concentration the lower the level of fqs concentration in the soil the higher is the adsorption rate in lettuce the cip adsorption was 90 100 cucumber 70 100 barley 64 100 130 10 phytoremediation of cip vetiver grass is used in the phytoremediation of antibiotics vetiver grass can tolerate inorganic and organic pollutants a study by panja et al 131 showed the ability of vetiver grass in the removal of cip from aquatic media with a major aim for the development of the plant based method for the treatment of wastewater 131 the transformation and elimination of cip were evaluated in the study in 30 days 80 of cip was removed and transformation products of cip in the tissues of vetiver indicated the potential role of root associated microbes in the metabolism of plants and degradation of cip a study by sodhi et al 25 showed the cip removal in hoagland media by eichhornia crassipes and showed 78 removal of cip and enhanced removal was observed in the by microbacterium sp whc1 in the presence of plant root exudates 25 table 5 summarizes the removal of cip by the living organisms existing literature shows a limitation in the use of biological methods in the removal of antibiotics for the effective removal of antibiotics modifications and recent advancements are made in the physicochemical methods 11 recent strategies in the cip removal 11 1 cip removal using modified advanced oxidation processes aops aops include technologies such as hydrogen peroxide h202 fenton fe ii h2o2 ultraviolet radiation uv and ozone o3 133 the ozonation of fqs was performed by liu et al 134 2 mg l of o3 led to 100 removal efficiency ozonation is effective in the decontamination of the contaminants from the effluents of wastewater but can lead to sore throat headaches and nose and eye irritation 134 water containing bromite can react with residual ozone to form carcinogenic bromate 135 fenton process is a slow process and ph needs to be adjusted and is not economical the quinolones degradation using zinc hydroxide chloride monohydrate nanoplates and zinc oxide nanoparticles for the cip removal achieved 91 66 and 95 35 of cip in 60 min at ph 8 136 the electrocoagulation is used with pure iron electrodes and 86 6 of cip was removed in 10 min at ph 4 137 electrocoagulation using aluminium electrodes achieved 88 57 cip in 20 min at ph 7 78 138 activated carbon from desilicated rice husk could absorb 0 787 mg of cip in 306 9 min 139 photocatalysis is advantageous as it has ambient temperature and pressure requirements and utilizes oxygen as an oxidant and solar radiation as an energy source economical and durable process having strong redox ability and no saturation due to adsorption and provides a complete decomposition of the organic molecule into inorganic molecules 140 11 2 cip removal by nanohybrid go o cnts nanohybrid adsorbents go o cnts were synthesized these adsorbents were composed of graphene oxide go cross linked via calcium ions ca2 and have oxidized carbon nanotubes ocnts in water and dispersed in tween 80 solution these adsorbents were characterized using infrared radiation scanning electron micrography thermogravimetric analysis and x ray diffraction studies optimum conditions such as ph of the solution the temperature of the solution nanohybrid mass contact time cross linking agent and go o cnt ratio 99 2 of cip was removed with the uptake of 512 mg g cip removal dynamics showed a pseudo second order reaction and displayed intraparticle diffusion thermodynamic parameters revealed that cip is a simple desorption process 141 11 3 adsorptive removal of cip using protein modified nanosilica promns moringa seeds were used for the extraction of protein and rice husk was used for the synthesis of nanosilica ft ir and high performance liquid chromatography were used to characterize the protein the protein adsorption onto nano silica was studied at different ionic strengths and ph the cip removal was significantly increased on the modification of the nano silica surface with protein promns assisted cip removal was effective and optimized at the adsorption dose of 10 mg ml time 90 min ionic strength 1 mm kcl and ph 7 the maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 85 mg g the adsorption capacity decreased with increasing ionic strength of kcl which suggests that the adsorption of cip onto promns is via electrostatic attraction between anionic species in cip and cationic species of promns 70 of cip removal was seen from the hospital wastewater promns is a new eco friendly adsorbent based method for the removal of antibiotics from aqueous solutions 142 11 4 cip removal by porous graphene hydrogel graphene is s new two dimensional 2d nano material having high mobility chemical stability and mechanical strength it is used as a high performance adsorbent as it has a large surface area but the surface area decreases on aggregation during the reduction process as a result the 2d graphene sheets have a limited use over the years the problem is solved by the synthesis of a three dimensional 3d porous graphene hydrogel gh as an adsorbent this method is the eco friendly and efficient hydrothermal method of reduction the gh granules were characterized using tem brunauer emmett teller bet method and xrd gh granules showed excellent cip adsorption capacity 235 6 mg g adsorption mechanisms include hydrogen bonding hydrophobic and π π eda interaction decreasing the size of hydrogels can significantly increase the cip removal and adsorption process 143 water was present in more than 99 by wt of hydrogels and has a key role in the adsorption process the gh granules have a promising role in the removal of the antibiotic from aqueous solutions 144 12 conclusions the antibiotics and the resistant genes are released into the ecosystem which has led to antibiotic pollution in the environment the antibiotics have a dreadful impact on the non target bacteria and disrupt their ecological functions they can either cause inhibition or disappearance of bacterial groups i e they can either have a bactericidal or bacteriostatic effect or can confer resistance in the bacteria by generating phenotypic and genetic variability both physicochemical and biological treatment has been used to control bacterial resistance although complete removal is not feasible the fungi and bacteria are shown to be impressive in their capability to degrade and transform cip however biotransformation of antibiotics is seen the antibiotics exert their effect on non target organisms also pharmaceuticals have adverse consequences on living beings harmful effects are seen on plants animals and microorganisms therefore a more comprehensive understanding of the potential threats caused by these antibiotics on the environment is required advance studies should be conducted for estimating the effectiveness of the bioremediation of antibiotics the mechanisms which infer antimicrobial resistance should be studied in depth funding this study was supported by the funding agency

13332,waterborne pathogens including viruses bacteria and micropollutants secreted from population can spread through the sewerage system in this study the efficiency of unique effervescent ferrate based tablets was evaluated for total rna and dna removal disinfection and degradation of micropollutants in hospital wastewater for the purpose of testing proposed tablets based on citric acid or sodium dihydrogen phosphate were used for various types of hospital wastewater with specific biological and chemical contamination total rna destruction efficiency using tablets was 70 100 depending on the type of acidic component dna destruction efficiency was lower on the level 51 94 depending on the type of acidic component in addition our study confirms that effervescent ferrate based tablets are able to efficiently remove of sars cov 2 rna from wastewater degradation of often detected micropollutants antiepileptic antidepressant antihistamine hypertensive and their metabolites was dependent on the type of detected pharmaceuticals and on the acidic component used sodium dihydrogen phosphate based tablet appeared to be more effective than citric acid based tablet and removed some pharmaceuticals with efficiency higher than 97 last but not least the disinfection ability was also verified tableted ferrates were confirmed to be an effective disinfectant and no resistant microorganisms were observed after treatment total and antibiotic resistant bacteria coliforms and enterococci were determined by cultivation on diagnostic selective agar growth media keywords ferrate vi sars cov 2 wastewater treatment pharmaceuticals antibiotic resistant bacteria 1 introduction the hospital wastewaters play significant role as important source of viruses and their fragments bacteria and also pharmaceutical residues 1 2 conventional biological treatment processes such as nitrification or denitrification have limited or minimal options for elimination of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and of virus rna 3 presence and spread of arb is becoming one of the problems endangering public health although this threat has fallen behind the current pandemic it could seriously complicate treatment of many covid 19 patients and may increase mortality 4 covid 19 pandemic contributes and enhances development and dissemination of antibiotic resistance due to widespread biocide use and increased consumption of antibiotics also by covid 19 patients from this point of view efficient disinfection of wastewater is needed 5 the presence of viruses and their fragments in wastewaters raises considerable concern due to their ability of possible resistance to disinfection procedures 6 the recent studies declare that 2 49 5 of covid 19 positive cases had diarrhea 7 and actually it is known that some viruses can spread through wastewater into which they are excreted together with human excrements in amount of 102 to 1012 copies per gram of excrement 6 currently there is assumption that some types of coronaviruses can survive several days in the environment and the question about the possible transmission via wastewater must be asked 8 sars cov 2 rna was detected in 40 89 of excrement from covid positive patients 9 12 duration of faecal viral shedding was 1 33 days after negative nasopharyngeal swab 13 also the positive detection of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater was observed in several recent studies 1 14 17 the problem of hospital wastewaters is also closely related to occurrence of micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs 18 19 these micropollutants may be harmful mainly to aquatic organisms but also to environment including humans because they can infiltrate into the groundwater and expose drinking water sources 20 21 many pharmaceuticals occurred in hospital wastewater are very stable non biodegradable and resistant against conventional wastewater treatment 22 to improve the quality of wastewater treatment especially in places with a higher occurrence of pharmaceuticals advanced oxidation processes aops were designed as possible tertiary wastewater treatment process among various aops ferrates have been gaining popularity ferrates are very strong oxidative agents with a redox potential of 2 2 v in acidic environment 23 ferrates have unique disinfection properties and have shown the great potential in wastewater treatment as a coagulant and disinfectant what can be used also in viral rna elimination 24 recently in addition to pure ferrate vi various water soluble polymeric capsules containing ferrate vi powder were designed 25 26 capsules were used for wastewater treatment not only in the case of various pharmaceuticals efficiency over 80 but also for antibiotic resistant bacteria elimination with promising results complete removal 5 25 during the current pandemic situation the issue of the virus occurrence in wastewater arises as a risk factor for spreading of infectious diseases virus surveillance in wastewater offer promising results with possible prediction of disease outbreaks 27 on the other hand the usage of ferrates as the wastewater treatment method can help prevent the spread of particles of viruses through the sewage system providing the safety solution in the case of new pandemic situation similar to the actual sars cov 2 the uniqueness of this paper lays in special design of tableted ferrates with effervescent effect and their application for the removal of rna viruses from hospital wastewater ferrate based tablets present complex method of wastewater treatment there is an urgent need to obtain more information on the possibilities of spreading sars cov 2 and the ability of wastewater treatment plant wwtp to remove fragments of this virus which is not currently achieved with conventional methods our study provides an interesting cheap and effective solution to several problems associated with the presence of micropollutants and pathogens in wastewater including viral fragments focusing on sars cov 2 2 experimental 2 1 preparation of effervescent ferrate vi based tablets potassium ferrate vi tablet was prepared using hydraulic hand press trystom h62 with die for tablet 13 mm according to 28 three types of tablets with purity of ferrate vi 33 7 were designed based on potassium ferrate citric acid anhydrous sodium hydrogen carbonate mass ratio 1 2 1 labeled a potassium ferrate sodium dihydrogen phosphate sodium hydrogen carbonate mass ratio 1 4 1 labeled b and pure potassium ferrate tablet 125 mg labeled f one tablet per 100 ml of wastewater was dosed as controls were used tablets without ferrates i e tablets based on acidic component and sodium hydrogen carbonate reaction time was 5 min all experiments were carried out in triplicate 2 2 quantification of rna and dna water samples were processed according to 29 nucleic acids were isolated by trizol qubit fluorometer qubit rna and dna hs assay kits thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa were used for the quantification of total rna and total dna the presence of sars cov 2 fragments were assessed using quantitect sybr green rt pcr kit qiagen

carried out in triplicate 2 3 antibiotic resistance detection detection of total and antibiotic resistant enterococci and coliform bacteria in raw wastewater samples was performed according to 30 ampicillin gentamicin tetracycline chloramphenicol ciprofloxacin and vancomycin were applied in concentrations equal to resistance breakpoints for studied bacteria given by eucast 31 all experiments were carried out in triplicate 2 4 wastewater sampling and hplc ms ms analysis wastewater samples from hospital effluent table 1 were collected from the sampling point by an automatic sampling device from 7 to 10 a m decanted samples in 10 minute intervals with a total volume of 1800 ml the samples were collected in plastic bottles and were frozen 18 c 2 h after the sampling or stored in the fridge 9 c samples for disinfection study the wastewater samples were let to thaw at room temperature filtered through to the syringe filter 0 20 μm regenerated cellulose labicom czech republic and a mixture of isotopically labeled internal standards was added before in line spe lc ms ms analysis the analytical method has been previously described 32 all experiments were carried out in triplicate this paper discusses selected in wastewater often detected pharmaceuticals or their metabolites from different therapeutic classes such as antiepileptic antidepressant antihistamine and hypertensive disinfection of wastewater in the central hospital is currently carried out by chlorine gas its concentration in the effluent is kept at the level 4 5 mg l and removal efficiency of total rna fragments is about 60 3 results and discussion 3 1 quantification of total rna and dna and their removal from hospital wastewater the following data summarize results of the quantification of total rna and total dna in the samples before and after ferrate based tablets treatment the initial concentration of sars cov 2 was 6400 copy l the removal efficiency of designed tablets was high especially in the case of pure ferrate vi tablet f up to 100 pure ferrates are very strong oxidants and can completely destroy viruses including sars cov 2 and their fragments tableted ferrate vi showed lower efficiency caused by the presence of the acidic substance which has been preferentially degraded by the ferrates rna removal efficiency was 80 100 for a tablets and 70 94 for b tablets similar results were obtained for dna removal the removal efficiency was 80 94 for a tablets and 51 82 for b tablets the efficiency of the a tablets based on citric acid was significantly higher than b tablets based on sodium dihydrogen phosphate in all cases ferrate based tablets seem to be the suitable option for the destruction of rna parts of viruses as the samples were positively tested for sars cov 2 before the usage of tablets and negatively tested afterwards the options currently in use are for example a set of disinfection tanks directly on site with infectious cases but the disadvantage of these tanks is the high consumption of chlorine based preparations and the need for multiple disinfection steps 33 by removing rna and dna fragments does not occur the horizontal transfer of genetic information through wastewater 34 the presence of sars cov 2 rna confirmed by rt pcr analysis in wastewater does not automatically imply the presence of infectious virus however studies on the related sars cov virus suggest that these types of coronaviruses may be infectious in wastewater for some time according to this study this virus retains infectivity in wastewater for up to 14 days at 4 c under certain conditions but at 20 c for 48 h 35 there are only few studies on inactivation of sars cov 2 in wastewater so far chan et al 36 reported that the genome of the sarscov 2 strains are phylogenetically closest to the bat sars related coronaviruses and the spike protein has a 78 nucleotide identity with the human sars cov 1 due to the similarities between sars cov 1 and sars cov 2 the sars cov 2 might also be sensitive to either environment factors or disinfectants our results show that the designed tablets have the ability to destroy viruses very quickly effective and without hazardous radical by products what is a typical advantage of ferrates there was also confirmed the ability of tableted ferrates to remove sars cov 2 rna directly from the hospital wastewater 3 2 efficiency of effervescent ferrate based tablets in antibiotic resistant bacteria elimination number of total and antibiotic resistant coliform bacteria in untreated water ranged from 2 21 0 03 to 3 69 0 03 log cfu ml and number of total enterococci was 1 00 0 02 log cfu ml no antibiotic resistant enterococci were detected in raw effluent water treatment of wastewater with tableted ferrate caused a decrease of all detected antibiotic resistant bacteria below the detection limit 3 3 effervescent ferrate based tablets used for wastewater treatment prepared tablets a b and f were also used for the study of removal of selected pharmaceuticals and their metabolites present in wastewater samples only compounds occurred in collected wastewater at concentration above 100 ng l are reported obtained results are summarized in table 2 presented pharmaceuticals are often occurred in wastewater and in surface water and are difficult to degrade 37 38 pure ferrate was very effective in trazodone oxcarbamazepine and o desmethylvenlafaxine removal with efficiency between 89 and 98 ferrate based tablets treatment resulted in higher removal efficiency in some cases for carbamazepine and its metabolites cetirizine metoprolol acid mirtazapine and lamotrigine compared to pure ferrate experiment generally the highest pharmaceuticals removal efficiency was achieved using tablets containing sodium dihydrogen phosphate labeled b removal efficiency by ferrates depends on the way in which the oxidation of individual pharmaceuticals takes place it also depends on the oxidative potential of the pharmaceuticals thus whether the redox potential of ferrates is high enough to oxidize a particular class of pharmaceuticals 4 conclusions our study for the first time reported the unique effervescent ferrate based tablets for the complex wastewater treatment including viral rna destruction and disinfection viruses like a sars cov 2 or their rna fragments can be embedded in excrements as well as urine and conventional disinfection procedures are not effective enough to destroy them 39 designed ferrate based tablets effectively removed up to 90 of total rna and 87 of total dna fragments of sars cov 2 were completely removed using ferrate based tablets prepared tablets removed at least 99 9 of bacteria from wastewater and tested antibiotic resistant bacteria were below limit of detection proposed tableted ferrates are also very effective 96 99 in wastewater treatment of some pharmaceuticals and their metabolites o desmethylvenlafaxine oxcarbamazepine trazodone and mirtazapine obtained results indicate higher removal efficiency when sodium dihydrogen phosphate was used as an acid substance balancing of ph of ferrates reaction tableted ferrates with effervescent effect offer the fresh look at the way of potentially infectious hospital wastewater treatment simple dosage and effervescent effect that replace the stirring are unique benefits of tableted ferrates the absence of dangerous radical by products unlike disinfection using chlorine compounds advises ferrates on environmental friendly technology and their price increases this rank designed tablets can be used for quick disinfection after using the toilet in hospitals or medical centres with infectious cases in household for wastewater treatment as replacement for chlorine based

potential of the pharmaceuticals thus whether the redox potential of ferrates is high enough to oxidize a particular class of pharmaceuticals 4 conclusions our study for the first time reported the unique effervescent ferrate based tablets for the complex wastewater treatment including viral rna destruction and disinfection viruses like a sars cov 2 or their rna fragments can be embedded in excrements as well as urine and conventional disinfection procedures are not effective enough to destroy them 39 designed ferrate based tablets effectively removed up to 90 of total rna and 87 of total dna fragments of sars cov 2 were completely removed using ferrate based tablets prepared tablets removed at least 99 9 of bacteria from wastewater and tested antibiotic resistant bacteria were below limit of detection proposed tableted ferrates are also very effective 96 99 in wastewater treatment of some pharmaceuticals and their metabolites o desmethylvenlafaxine oxcarbamazepine trazodone and mirtazapine obtained results indicate higher removal efficiency when sodium dihydrogen phosphate was used as an acid substance balancing of ph of ferrates reaction tableted ferrates with effervescent effect offer the fresh look at the way of potentially infectious hospital wastewater treatment simple dosage and effervescent effect that replace the stirring are unique benefits of tableted ferrates the absence of dangerous radical by products unlike disinfection using chlorine compounds advises ferrates on environmental friendly technology and their price increases this rank designed tablets can be used for quick disinfection after using the toilet in hospitals or medical centres with infectious cases in household for wastewater treatment as replacement for chlorine based

13333,pharmaceutical compounds in wastewater are currently becoming emerging concern as the utilization of drugs in anthropogenic activities this research analyzed the effectiveness of pilot scale vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland vssfcw planted with scirpus grossus using an aeration system for simultaneous removal of ibuprofen chemical oxygen demand cod and nutrients nh3 n no3 n and po4 p from domestic wastewater the constructed wetland cw platforms 500 l capacity filled with gravel and sand and planted with native species of s grossus were used to treat pharmaceutical content in domestic wastewater continuously for 21 days three experiments were performed with hydraulic retention time hrt of 3 4 and 5 days aeration rates of 0 1 and 2 l min were employed for each hrt the combined effect of hrt exposure period and aeration to simultaneously remove ibuprofen organic materials and nutrients were examined statistically using two way anova and tukey hsd test filtration and adsorption mechanisms of ibuprofen compound by sand medium matrix were proven to occur using solid phase extraction method the removal efficiency of ibuprofen and cod were dependent on the applied aeration and hrt p 0 05 a longer hrt increased the removal efficiency of ibuprofen while it did not significantly affect the nutrient removal p 0 05 the vssfcw under 2 l min aeration and hrt of 5 days has removed 99 3 of ibuprofen 88 2 of cod 99 1 of ammonia 72 9 of nitrate nitrogen and 83 2 of orthophosphate with effluent successfully met the effluent standard b set by malaysian government therefore the vssfcw planted with s grossus becomes a technically feasible method for treating sewage containing pharmaceutical compounds keywords emerging contaminants pharmaceutical scirpus grossus vssfcw wastewater treatment 1 introduction pharmaceutical residues in wastewater pose a challenge for wastewater treatment technology domestic sewage pharmaceutical industries hospital and landfill leachate are several sources for pharmaceutical compounds found in the environment 1 among that origins anthropogenic activities played major role in the release of pharmaceutical compounds 2 3 human is the main contributor to the availability of the pharmaceutical compounds in domestic wastewater residual pharmaceutical compounds normally taken by human as medicine will be released as metabolic products with urine and feces 4 6 the utilization of herbicides and insecticides also contributes to the existence of pharmaceutical components in surface water 7 9 pharmaceutical components in environment may spark several problems 3 some pharmaceutical compounds exhibit chronic effect and even acute lethal effect to certain organisms 8 10 antibiotics one type of pharmaceutical compounds are also considered as emerging concern in the field of environmental pollution 11 12 the existence of antibiotics in the environment poses harmful effect for organisms antibiotics existence can generate new gene of antibiotic resistant expression 13 that subsequently may create new antibiotic resistant strain of microorganisms 14 antibiotic resistant microorganisms can cause further problem especially for human health diseases caused by antibiotic resistant microorganisms will be harder to be cured as compared to the commonly disease related microorganisms 15 ibuprofen is one type of pharmaceutical compounds found in the wastewater 16 it is a common painkiller used to treat aches fever and pains 17 and also reduces inflammation ibuprofen and any other pharmaceuticals in domestic wastewater are originated from human excreta and disposal of expired unused drugs into sewerage systems 18 19 the other sources may come from landfills for expired drugs and improper effluent treatment in pharmaceutical industries combination of ibuprofen is also being used in remediating cold and influenzas commonly ibuprofen is sold without prescription under several trademarks 19 20 several researchers reported the negative impacts of ibuprofen existence in environment geiger et al 21 reported the decreasing algal population density caused by the exposure of ibuprofen similarly moro et al 22 also claimed the alteration of structure and ultra skeleton of scenedesmus rubescens after 30 days exposure of ibuprofen in addition a significantly decreasing number of eggs of daphnia manga was noticed only after 6 hour exposure to 50 μg l of ibuprofen 23 adsorption 24 and filtration 23 are the common technology used for treating ibuprofen as water contaminant while electrocoagulation ozonation and photocatalytic has also emerged as alternative technology 24 26 physical treatment like filtration removed the ibuprofen by its particle size while adsorption and electrocoagulation removed ibuprofen by its charge chemical coagulation and flocculation is also evident to treat ibuprofen in water wastewater 27 despite the reliable efficiency of the above mentioned technologies there is a concern on the used chemicals and treatment residues that might cause further pollution to the environment 28 30 in addition chemical treatment also generates abundant amount of sludge which requires further handling 27 31 the high consumption of energy and high operational cost by applying these technologies also need to be considered 27 32 to comprise these issues biological treatment using wetland becomes a very promising technology to treat ibuprofen contaminated water among biological treatment methods constructed wetland cw is the most promising technology to be applied in treating ibuprofen contaminated water 16 33 34 cw mimics the natural phenomenon of filtration degradation and uptake of pollutants 35 36 a horizontal sub surface cw planted with thypa angustifolia showed the efficiency of ibuprofen removal up to 70 through complex plant microbes medium interactions with aeration supply had promoted the removal of ibuprofen by enhancing the aerobic bacteria growth which played important roles in the degradation of ibuprofen in wastewater 10 in addition zhang et al 37 also mentioned that different hydraulic retention time hrt affected the removal kinetics of pharmaceutical components in cw based on many conducted studies 38 40 the results showed that hrt between 2 and 7 days is the most applicable depending on the pollutant concentrations loading and the capability of plant species the utilization of plants showed a significant increment of ibuprofen removal as compared to the non planted system indicating the importance of plants for the degradation of ibuprofen in wetland 16 another study showed the performance of vertical free flow cw planted with eichhornia crassipes and heliconia rostrata in treating ibuprofen in wastewater with removal value up to 89 17 following the emergence of the pharmaceutical compounds inside wastewater originating from atherogenic activities 41 research conducted on the simultaneous removal of nutrients and ibuprofen from domestic wastewater is not widely conducted yet scirpus grossus is a native plant species in tropical countries which exhibits great performance of organic and nutrient removal in domestic wastewater using cw 36 42 44 this species was chosen based on its great performance in removing pollutant in domestic wastewater it was able to remove up to 90 of cod from domestic wastewater 43 while another research 45 mentioned its capability to achieve an average of 69 for bod removal this species also had demonstrated good performance for nutrient removal from domestic wastewater with values reaching 84 7 of nh4 n 38 3 no3 n 71 0 of po4 p and 61 2 po4 3 42 45 looking at the performance of this species and the emerging of pharmaceutical compounds especially ibuprofen in domestic wastewater an opportunity to conduct a research of ibuprofen containing domestic wastewater using cw planted with s grossus is considered applicable hence its performance in treating pharmaceutical compound especially ibuprofen is awaiting to be explored further moreover most of the current treatment of ibuprofen in wastewater is through adsorption and filtration and yet they are conducted at laboratory scale 23 24 while the utilization of pilot scale cw planted with native plants under different hrt and aeration systems is currently still limited understanding the potential of cw this research aimed to analyze the simultaneous removal of ibuprofen chemical oxygen demand cod and nutrients nh3 n no3 n and po4 p from domestic wastewater using pilot scale vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland vssfcw planted with s grossus under different hrt and aeration rates this setup was also used to analyze the capability of s grossus in treating ibuprofen since research on ibuprofen treatment using s grossus is currently limited the presented result is targeted to contribute to the knowledge of alternative environmentally friendly technology to treat pharmaceutical containing wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and plant source this study was conducted in an open natural environment in a greenhouse at universiti kebangsaan malaysia ukm three pilot scale vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland vssfcw were operated at 30 5 c ambient temperature the dimensions of the subfloor wetland reactors were 1 m width 1 m length 60 cm height 0 5 cm thickness to accommodate a total of 45 l of wastewater three reactors with similar sand gravel layers made of fiberglass were used the height of the layers of sand from the bottom upward was i 15 cm of gravel 10 20 mm in diameter ii 5 cm of fine sand 2 mm in diameter and iii 1 cm of gravel 1 5 mm in diameter with total sand weight of 77 kg inlet and outlet flows were secured with gravel 22 5 cm thickness ɸ of 10 20 mm schematic diagram and real reactor setup can be seen in fig 1a and b the plants scirpus grossus used in this research were collected from tasik chini pahang malaysia fig 1c it is a native tropical bulrush under the family of cyperaceae which is categorized as emergent plant that is commonly found in swamp area 31 like tasik chini the second biggest freshwater lake in malaysia at the initial stage of research work healthy 30 day old plants were acclimatized into the sand medium before the second generation were used with all the plants were propagated at the ukm greenhouse all the plants used in the main research were already acclimatized for 30 days 46 each vssfcw was planted with 20 acclimatized s grossus plants three identical wetland reactor systems were set to run without aeration and with aeration of 1 and 2 l min in different cycle each reactor was designed to run in a continuous mode with different flow rates of 15 l day 11 25 l day and 9 l day producing hrt of 3 4 and 5 days each vssfcw was flowed with sewage for 30 days before introducing ibuprofen containing wastewater to create a stable cw ecosystem these systems were then running continuously for a research period of 21 days to treat ibuprofen containing wastewater 2 2 wastewater source characteristics and parameter analysis domestic wastewater was collected from bukit puteri area bangi malaysia wastewater was collected from a collecting tank that accommodates 100 number of households initial characteristics of collected wastewater were ph 7 5 chemical oxygen demand cod 182 7 1 5 mg l nh3 n 42 7 6 5 mg l no3 n 7 5 1 6 mg l and po4 p 30 7 10 mg l the simulated ibuprofen containing domestic wastewater was prepared at an initial ibuprofen concentration of 600 μg l ibuprofen concentration was prepared by diluting ibuprofen powder merck germany to the collected domestic wastewater 47 the addition of ibuprofen was carried out to accommodate the highest concentration of this compound that ever analyzed from the wastewater the concentration of pharmaceutical compounds varies by day in domestic wastewater while during the sample taken it was measured in a very low concentration parameters ibuprofen cod nh3 n no3 n po4 p were analyzed on days 0 3 12 and 21 on each day three samples of water 500 ml were taken from each vssfcw outlet sand sample 10 g was also taken near the outlet on each sampling day immediately after sampling was completed the sand for ibuprofen analysis was extracted ultrasonically epa method 3550c with a solvent extraction method 48 using ultrasonic irradiation producing oscillating cavitation bubbles and shockwaves that can break the sand particle aggregates and enhance separation of target contaminants from the sand surface 49 this method can consequently reach the inner space of the sand structure 50 chemical oxygen demand cod was measured spectrophotometrically by a spectrophotometer dr3900 hach usa using test kits according to the manufacturer s instruction the ammoniacal nitrogen nh3 n content was determined using nessler reagent followed with hach dr3900 spectrophotometer reading 51 nitrate nitrogen no3 n and orthophosphate po4 p were measured using hach dr3900 spectrophotometer the extracted ibuprofen was processed further through solid phase extraction spe jones chromatography usa using 200 mg 6 ml oasis hlb extraction cartridges waters corporation massachusetts usa to concentrate the ibuprofen levels in the water sample the hlb cartridges were preconditioned using 3 ml of acetonitrile 3 ml of methanol and 3 ml of deionized water at ph 2 the sample was then percolated through a cartridge at a controlled flow rate with a vacuum manifold after percolation the hlb cartridge was rinsed with 10 ml of deionized water and the eluent was discarded after percolation and left 1 h 52 the analyte was eluted with 4 ml of acetonitrile and collected in a vial for hplc measurement the eluted sample was measured with hplc agilent 1200 series usa for ibuprofen determination through a standard curve calibration using a zorbax c18 column 250 mm 4 6 mm and 5 mm at a uv wavelength of 230 nm the mobile phases used were methanol and water at a ratio of 60 40 with a flow rate of 1 l min 2 3 statistical data analysis data were statistically analyzed using spss 21 spss inc usa all obtained data was tested for homogeneity and normality 53 which turned out to be homogeny and normally distributed two way analysis of variance anova was then conducted to examine the correlation between the removal efficiency of parameters ibuprofen cod nh3 n no3 n and po4 p with the experimental factors hrt exposure period aeration post hoc tests were performed using tukey s hsd test for significant factor after anova to determine the significant difference between the obtained results among factors to the response 54 in which conclusion of significant difference was drawn at p 0 05 55 3 results and discussion 3 1 ibuprofen removal from wastewater result of two way anova analysis for the ibuprofen removal is tabulated in table s1 table s1 shows that hrt exposure period and aeration gave significant effect to the ibuprofen removal from wastewater p 0 05 interaction between factors also gave significant effect to the ibuprofen removal the concentrations of ibuprofen in the wastewater sample throughout the research period are shown in fig 2 in all vertical sub surface flow constructed wetland vssfcw reactors the concentration of ibuprofen decreased throughout the research period the following values were obtained after 21 days of treatment 54 7 μg l 34 7 47 7 μg l 47 and 34 7 μg l 56 6 for respective hrt of 3 4 and 5 days in non aerated system 24 μg l 72 6 17 μg l 80 5 and 9 μg l 89 5 for hrt of 3 4 and 5 days respectively in 1 l min reactor 9 μg l 89 6 6 7 μg l 91 9 and 0 6 μg l 99 3 for respective hrt of 3 4 and 5 days in 2 l min reactor according to fig 2 the measured ibuprofen in wastewater was already reduced from the prepared concentration starting from day 0 first day water out from the outlet the reduced concentration starting from day 0 was subjected due to the filtration mechanism by the sand medium and the root of scirpus grossus ibuprofen may be attached to the sand matrix via adsorption mechanism during the filtration through sand medium 56 57 discussed further in section 3 2 in all treatment reactors hrt of 5 days showed significantly higher performance in ibuprofen removal as compared to other hrt p 0 05 longer hrt create a better filtration mechanism of ibuprofen by the medium and rhizosphere of s grossus 58 the longer hrt gave longer time for ibuprofen to contact with the treatment agent in which biological process may perform better 59 61 this obtained result confirmed the previous result by ejhed et al 61 in which longer hrt performed better removal of pharmaceutical compounds as compared to the shorter hrt due to the higher degradation by microbial community in accordance with hrt longer exposure period also showed a better removal it indicated that reactors had improved their performance after longer contact with the pollutants as similarly discovered by other studies 36 62 similarly the increasing of aeration gave significant effect to the ibuprofen removal p 0 05 the addition of aeration showed significant difference in removal as compared to the non aerated system while the highest performance was obtained on 2 l min aeration system oxygen provides better redox environment for aerobic bacteria in the rhizosphere area to oxidize ibuprofen while plants can adsorb the degraded compounds more easily 52 63 64 bioaccumulation uptake by plants and translocation of degraded pharmaceutical compounds is higher due to the lower hydrophobicity characteristics of the intermediate compounds such as carboxy and hydroxy ibuprofen 65 as compared to the original ibuprofen structure 66 67 combination of 2 l min aeration and hrt of 5 days performed 99 removal of ibuprofen from the initial concentration as comparison nivala et al 68 exhibited only 79 24 removal of ibuprofen compounds using sub surface flow wetland nivala et al 68 also revealed the importance of aeration to enhance the growth of aerobic microbial community that contribute significantly to the degradation of this compound 3 2 ibuprofen concentration in sand medium medium becomes an important part in vssfcw since it acts as filter and carrier for the microorganism growth during treatment 35 36 69 adsorption of ibuprofen in the sand matrix is the mechanism subjected to occur during this study 56 57 the factors of hrt exposure period and aeration gave significant impact to the decreasing of ibuprofen concentration in sand medium after 21 days of treatment p 0 05 result of two way anova analysis for the ibuprofen concentration in sand medium is tabulated in table s2 results showed that the concentration of ibuprofen in sand medium at day 0 of treatment were high reaching up to 147 8 17 4 μg g fig 3 this obtained result confirmed that ibuprofen was significantly reduced from wastewater even at day 0 due to the adsorption by sand and plant s root matrix high ibuprofen concentration in sand at day 0 was obtained due to the retained particle during filtration by sand medium and the root of s grossus the concentration of ibuprofen then decreased throughout the research period fig 3 the decreasing ibuprofen concentration in the sand matrix showed that degradation of ibuprofen by microorganism in medium and root area had occurred during this study ibuprofen concentration in sand in all treatment reactors after 21 days of treatment were 34 7 38 7 23 3 μg g for hrt of 3 4 and 5 days respectively in non aerated system 18 17 3 14 9 μg g for respective hrt of 3 4 and 5 days in 1 l min reactor 2 5 3 3 2 3 μg g for hrt of 3 4 and 5 days respectively in 2 l min reactor the longer the hrt the lower ibuprofen concentration after 21 days of treatment similar to ibuprofen in wastewater longer contact of pollutant with treatment agent has resulted in better removal performance 42 in accordance with hrt the longer exposure period also showed lower ibuprofen concentration the decreasing ibuprofen concentration in sand medium throughout the research period was due to the degradation by microorganism while the degraded compounds were subjected to be accumulated by plants 59 61 this mechanism was assured by the decrease of both ibuprofen concentration in sand medium and also in the outlet giving evidence that uptake mechanism phytoaccumulation by plants occurred during the treatment 70 71 by providing sufficient contact time plants can perform extraction of ibuprofen and or intermediate compounds i e hydroxy ibuprofen 1 2 dihydroxy ibuprofen carboxy ibuprofen and glucopyranosyloxy hydroxy ibuprofen 65 72 73 after degradation by microbes or plants exudates thus completely removing it from the sand matrix 10 74 the degradation of ibuprofen compounds in sand and plant s root matrix was also supported by the aerobic condition proven by the lower ibuprofen concentration in the aerated reactors as compared to the non aerated reactors 68 75 providing more oxygen has also positively boosted the degradation of ibuprofen compound which 2 l min reactors showed significantly lower ibuprofen concentration after 21 days of treatment as compared to 1 l min reactors p 0 05 higher aeration rate boosts the growth of aerobic microorganism in medium and creates a better redox condition for bacteria to completely degrade pharmaceutical compounds 76 77 filtration and adsorption mechanisms of ibuprofen compound by sand medium matrix were hypothesized to occur in the initial phase of the research then accompanied by the high decay rate of this compound inside the system thus decreasing the concentration of ibuprofen in both wastewater and sand medium to support this hypothesis sand adsorption capacity and first order decay rate were calculated based on the measured concentration of ibuprofen in sand medium the adsorption capacity was calculated by referring to the formula provided by li et al 78 eq 1 while the decay rate of ibuprofen from sand was calculated using half time first order equation following the formula from ahmed 79 eq 2 the adsorption capacity was calculated from the decreasing concentration of ibuprofen from wastewater while the decay rate was calculated from the decreasing concentration of ibuprofen in sand medium both data will be fitted to the following expressions 1 q t c o c t v m 2 ln c t ln c o kt where q t is adsorption capacity at t time μg kg co is initial concentration of ibuprofen 600 μg l ct is concentration of ibuprofen at t time μg l v is the total volume of wastewater in reactor 45 l k is decay rate 1 day and t is time d the result of adsorption capacity calculation is tabulated in table 1 while summary of r 2 and k for the decay rate calculation are summarized in table 2 additional data for the linearization of data based on eq 2 are provided in table s3 based on the calculated adsorption capacity it can be seen that adsorption of ibuprofen had already occurred since day 0 of the treatment the first time wastewater flow through the outlet this obtained result confirmed the observation of ibuprofen concentration in sand medium even at day 0 of the research period the adsorption capacity of sand increased during the 21 days of observation indicating that ibuprofen was accumulated in the sand matrix from the continuous adsorption throughout the research period 80 this result was in contrast with the measured concentration of ibuprofen in sand in which it shows decreasing trend in all reactors the result of decay rate calculation showed that the higher applied aeration the greater decay rate constant k obtained indicating that other mechanisms like degradation and uptake rather than only adsorption by sand medium were involved during the treatment 81 the decay rate analysis showed that a greater value in the highly aerated system suggested to be the evidence of the increasing activity of the aerobic bacteria inside the system 82 confirming the result of the decreasing concentration of ibuprofen in sand medium despite the applied aeration hrt also plays role in providing contact of bacterial community to ibuprofen while also retains ibuprofen particle longer in the sand matrix providing more effective filtration and adsorption of ibuprofen compounds 80 the highest removal percentage of ibuprofen was in accordance with the biggest adsorption capacity and the decay rate obtained in the 2 l min aerated system at hrt of 5 days 3 3 ibuprofen concentration in plants in cw removal of organic pollutant can occur from the degradation of microorganism existing in the medium and also the uptake by plants to prove that s grossus had played a role in the ibuprofen removal from wastewater extraction of ibuprofen was carried out from roots and shoots of s grossus which results are depicted in fig 4 and the results of anova can be seen in table s4 based on fig 4 it can be seen that plants absorb ibuprofen in all treatment reactor the variation of hrt gave significant differences to the concentration of ibuprofen in plants with hrt 5 showing significantly higher ibuprofen concentration as compared to other hrt the variations of aeration also gave significant differences to the ibuprofen concentration p 0 05 there was an increasing trend of ibuprofen concentration in both roots and shoots of s grossus throughout the research period indicating that bioaccumulation of this compound had occurred 83 the increasing aeration to 2 l min clearly gave a significant increase to the adsorbed ibuprofen suggesting that aeration may boost the rhizobacterial community to interact with the plants to perform phytoextraction 84 results also suggest that the fate of ibuprofen inside plants was more likely to be bioaccumulated in the root part of plants but different trend was obtained on the 2 l min aeration the 2 l min aeration showed higher ibuprofen concentration in shoot part suggesting that the increasing of aeration did not only promote the phytoextraction but also increase the translocation of the ibuprofen compound to the aerial part of s grossus plants the increasing ibuprofen translocation was subjected to occur due to the boost of rhizobacterial growth which then performed interaction with plants to enhance the compounds solubility resulting in the higher transport to the aerial part 66 85 3 4 chemical oxygen demand cod removal from wastewater chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations were considered to be high in the influent up to 182 67 1 51 mg l the cod concentration was contributed from pollutants in domestic wastewater and also the introduced ibuprofen results of two way anova table s5 showed that all factors hrt exposure period and aeration and the interaction between factors significantly affected the response cod removal p 0 05 conversely the effluent concentrations after 21 days of treatment were 119 mg l 35 1 85 5 mg l 53 1 and 81 9 mg l 55 for hrt of 3 4 and 5 days respectively in non aerated system 65 9 mg l 64 1 50 2 mg l 80 and 50 2 mg l 72 4 for respective hrt of 3 4 and 5 days in 1 l min reactor 13 3 μg l 92 6 10 3 μg l 94 4 and 22 μg l 88 2 for hrt of 3 4 and 5 days respectively in 2 l min reactor fig 5 furthermore the results show that all vssfcw systems with aeration were more reliable than without aerated system for cod removal in accordance with hasan et al 52 and ong et al 86 cod removal was significantly improved by the addition of aeration into the system p 0 05 longer hrt showed better cod removal performance due to the increase of pollutants with treatment agent 87 88 but hrt of 4 days showed significantly higher removal among other hrts microbial degradation is responsible to the removal of organic materials in constructed wetland cw 43 89 90 the sand medium and the plant root system provide an excellent condition for microbial community to attach and grow 69 91 92 the addition of aeration significantly improved the degradation of cod from wastewater p 0 05 oxygen is the major component needed for aerobic bacteria to grow when simultaneously utilizing organic materials as their carbon source for biomass growth resulting in the degradation of cod 63 88 93 the oxygen rich rhizosphere can also enhance the microbial degradation of organic pollutants from wastewater 43 higher cod removal obtained on hrt of 4 days as compared to hrt of 5 days may due to the limited available nutrient for bacteria growth which were responsible for the cod degradation 94 95 bacteria growth needs certain ratio of carbon nitrogen and phosphate for cell growth 94 96 97 limited available nitrogen was subjected to be the reason behind the decreasing cod removal on hrt 5 decay rate was calculated following eq 2 and tabulated in tables s6 and s7 to enhance the aforementioned statement based on the decay rate constant it can also be concluded that the higher aeration applied has resulted increment to the degradation of cod inside the system similar to the data obtained in fig 5 hrt of 4 days with 2 l min aeration gave higher decay rate as compared to the hrt of 5 days with 2 l min aeration this was an indication of limited growth of bacterial community which contributes to the degradation of organic materials 98 limited growth of bacteria may occur due to the limited nutrient n and p availability 94 inside the system to be discussed further in section 3 5 3 5 ammoniacal nitrogen nh3 n removal ammoniacal nitrogen concentrations were considered to be high in the influent up to 42 7 6 5 mg l two way anova analysis shows that exposure period and aeration gave significant effect to the response nh3 n removal p 0 05 while variation of hrt did not significantly affect the nh3 n removal p 0 05 table s8 the ammonia effluent concentrations were 10 mg l 66 7 14 mg l 60 and 20 mg l 55 6 for hrt of 3 4 and 5 days respectively in non aerated system 0 1 mg l 99 7 0 3 mg l 99 2 and 0 1 mg l 99 7 for hrt of 3 4 and 5 days respectively in 1 l min aeration system 0 2 mg l 99 6 0 4 mg l 99 2 and 0 4 mg l 99 1 for hrt of 3 4 and 5 days respectively fig 6 all vssfcw used in these experiments had positive ammonia reduction trends suggesting that the microbial community and plants were performing the ammonia removal 39 99 ammonia removal in cw was facilitated by the microbial degradation nitrification and plant uptake plants need nitrogen as their nutrient for growth 100 the addition of aeration clearly shows the significant improvement of ammonia removal aerated vs non aerated vssfcw p 0 05 ammonia can be removed from wastewater via nitrification mechanism thus eliminating it from the ammonia reading 44 101 high ammonia removal was subjected to the nitrification mechanism by nitrifying bacteria in the sand medium and root area of s grossus 102 the addition of aeration provides oxygen for the transformation of ammonia into nitrate or nitrite via microbial degradation 103 104 and subsequently being up taken by plants there is no significant difference between 1 and 2 l min aeration p 0 05 suggesting that 1 l min is enough to transform most of ammonia concentration in wastewater there is also no significant difference of ammonia removal in various hrts p 0 05 suggesting that ammonia removal was more related to the availability of oxygen in the system all aerated system achieved 99 of ammonia removal from wastewater this obtained result was in accordance with previous researches 105 107 which stated that the addition of aeration into the constructed wetland system significantly escalates the ammonia removal the obtained results showed that 1 l min of aeration with hrt of 3 days can remove ammonia 99 suggesting that longer hrt or increasing of aeration did not contribute to the addition of ammonia removal this phenomenon might be the reason of better cod removal in hrt of 4 days in which ammonia became the limiting factor of bacteria growth resulting in no addition of cod removal in longer hrt 94 95 98 the obtained results were in accordance with the calculated decay rate tables s9 and s10 which shows that the applied aeration gave increment to the decay rate the calculated decay rate also shows that 1 l min aeration gave higher rate as compared to the 2 l min aeration confirming that the 1 l min was sufficient to degrade the available nh3 n the decreasing decay rate in 2 l min aeration indicated the limited available nh3 n to be degraded further 94 3 6 nitrate nitrogen no3 n removal similar to nh3 n removal trend variation of hrt did not affect the no3 n removal significantly p 0 05 while the addition of aeration significantly increased the no3 n removal p 0 05 table s11 fig 7 shows the inlet and outlet concentrations of no3 n in all vssfcw system the influent concentration was 7 5 1 6 mg l the nitrate nitrogen effluent concentrations were 4 mg l 57 1 5 mg l 45 8 and 6 mg l 40 for hrt of 3 4 and 5 days respectively in non aerated system 2 mg l 71 4 1 8 mg l 70 and 2 2 mg l 66 6 for hrt of 3 4 and 5 days respectively in 1 l min reactor 0 3 mg l 96 6 0 5 mg l 91 5 and 1 4 mg l 72 9 for hrt of 3 4 and 5 days respectively in 2 l min reactor the longer the exposure period the more no3 n removal obtained indicating that the reactors improved the performance along the study period 36 42 62 degradation of nitrate supposed to occur under anoxic or anaerobic degradation while in this study nitrate nitrogen removal was subjected to occur by plant uptake the provided aeration enhanced the growth of bacteria in rhizosphere which can accelerate the uptake of no3 n by plants due to the promoted plant growth by bacteria plant interaction 95 108 109 this obtained result also confirmed the previous researches that nitrate nitrogen removal was more related to the oxygen availability in the system 99 106 110 referring to the calculated decay rate tables s12 and s13 and fig 7 the increasing hrt did not give improvement to the decay rate the highest decay rate obtained in hrt of 3 days with an aeration of 2 l min treatment period shows more effect to the no3 n removal due to the system stability and the growth of plants inside the cw the plant growth requires nutrients thus increasing the uptake of no3 n from the system 95 since the removal of no3 n occurred under anoxic or anaerobic condition the decreasing of this compound in this study was subjected to the plant uptake mechanism which was further expedited by the interaction of aerobic bacteria and plant root s system 92 3 7 orthophosphate po4 p removal the vssfcw had exhibited good performance of phosphate removal similar to ammoniacal nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen removal trend two way anova analysis also showed that exposure period and aeration gave significant effect to the po4 p removal p 0 05 while hrt did not contribute significantly p 0 05 table s14 fig 8 shows the concentration of orthophosphate in all vssfcw reactors throughout the research period initial concentration of orthophosphate in the system was 30 7 10 mg l the measured effluent were 13 mg l 48 16 mg l 40 7 and 14 5 mg l 37 for hrt of 3 4 and 5 days respectively in non aerated system 8 9 mg l 64 4 8 3 mg l 67 and 8 mg l 55 6 for hrt of 3 4 and 5 days respectively in 1 l min reactor 13 3 mg l 69 2 15 1 mg l 67 8 and 7 2 mg l 83 2 for hrt of 3 4 and 5 days respectively in 2 l min reactor referring to fig 8 and the results of decay rate calculation tables s15 and s16 the addition of aeration had improved the po4 p removal from the system while the increment of hrt did not significantly improve the po4 p removal the highest removal and decay rate of orthophosphate was obtained in reactor with 2 l min aeration at hrt of 5 days removal of orthophosphate inside the system was subjected to be extracted by s grossus as plants need adequate amount of n and p as nutrient source 111 113 removal of phosphate by bacteria called biological phosphate removal requires sequential anaerobic aerobic condition to completely transform soluble p from wastewater into biomass 114 while this study only conducted one condition non aerated or aerated thus plant uptake became the major contributor in the orthophosphate removal the longer the exposure period the higher orthophosphate removal obtained giving evidence that reactors had improved their quality and stability throughout the research period 36 42 62 increment of phosphate uptake by the addition of aeration to vssfcw was obtained due to the enhancement of microbial growth in rhizosphere of s grossus which later perform positive correlation with plant s root that may stimulate the nutrient uptake by plants 94 95 108 the highest po4 p removal was obtained under 2 l min aeration in hrt of 5 days with value reaching up to 83 2 3 8 overall performance evaluation the utilized vssfcw with 21 days operation period performed very well in removing pollutants from wastewater the highest ibuprofen removal was obtained under 2 l min aeration condition with hrt of 5 days reaching up to 99 3 the lowest ibuprofen concentration in sand medium after 21 days was obtained on the same reactor 2 l min aeration and hrt of 5 days with a value of 2 3 μg g cod removal trend was slightly different from ibuprofen in which its highest removal obtained on hrt of 4 days with 2 l min aeration with value reaching up to 94 4 variations of hrt showed no significant different in all nutrient nh3 n no3 n and po4 p removals p 0 05 while the addition of aeration significantly affects the nutrient removals p 0 05 the highest ammoniacal nitrogen removal was 99 7 in hrt of 3 and 5 days under 1 l min aeration but there is also no significantly difference with 2 l min aeration p 0 05 for nitrate nitrogen the highest removal was obtained under hrt of 3 days and 2 l min aeration with a value of 96 6 but there are insignificant differences with other hrt p 0 05 for orthophosphate parameter the highest removal was obtained under hrt of 5 days and 2 l min aeration with value of 83 2 the vssfcw with 2 l min showed a promising performance while hrt of 4 days showed the highest removal of cod and hrt of 5 days showed the highest removal of ibuprofen to compare the performance of these vssfcw a comparison with the standard limit set by department of environment malaysia 115 are presented in table 3 the utilized vssfcw with 2 l min aeration and hrt of 5 days success in fulfilling all standard b thus the effluent after treatment can be discharged into non closed surface water for non drinking raw water source river the ibuprofen concentration in effluent after treatment with 2 l min and hrt of 5 days was even lower than the effluent standard a 5 μg l but the orthophosphate concentration still above 5 mg l in order to fulfill all required parameters for standard a discharge into closed surface water for raw drinking water source enhanced biological phosphate removal should be provided 114 117 to obtain orthophosphate concentration below the maximum limit of standard a combination of plants that have high uptake of phosphate may also be utilized in order to reduce the treated orthophosphate concentration 118 119 4 conclusions simultaneous removal of ibuprofen organic materials cod and nutrients nh3 n no3 n and po4 p can be accomplished by the utilization of vertical sub surface flow constructed wetland vssfcw filtration and adsorption mechanisms of ibuprofen compound by sand medium matrix were observed by solid phase extraction method in the beginning of the research period the concentration of ibuprofen in sand and effluent were gradually reduced throughout the study period suggesting that microbial degradation and plant uptake mechanisms occurred simultaneously inside the systems aeration provided significant improvement for all parameters p 0 05 while longer hrt significantly improves the ibuprofen and cod removals p 0 05 the vssfcw showed the highest removal of ibuprofen up to 99 3 at hrt of 5 days with 2 l min aeration after 21 days of treatment this system also showed reduction of cod up to 88 2 ammoniacal nitrogen up to 99 1 nitrate nitrogen of 72 9 and orthophosphate of 83 2 the

13333,pharmaceutical compounds in wastewater are currently becoming emerging concern as the utilization of drugs in anthropogenic activities this research analyzed the effectiveness of pilot scale vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland vssfcw planted with scirpus grossus using an aeration system for simultaneous removal of ibuprofen chemical oxygen demand cod and nutrients nh3 n no3 n and po4 p from domestic wastewater the constructed wetland cw platforms 500 l capacity filled with gravel and sand and planted with native species of s grossus were used to treat pharmaceutical content in domestic wastewater continuously for 21 days three experiments were performed with hydraulic retention time hrt of 3 4 and 5 days aeration rates of 0 1 and 2 l min were employed for each hrt the combined effect of hrt exposure period and aeration to simultaneously remove ibuprofen organic materials and nutrients were examined statistically using two way anova and tukey hsd test filtration and adsorption mechanisms of ibuprofen compound by sand medium matrix were proven to occur using solid phase extraction method the removal efficiency of ibuprofen and cod were dependent on the applied aeration and hrt p 0 05 a longer hrt increased the removal efficiency of ibuprofen while it did not significantly affect the nutrient removal p 0 05 the vssfcw under 2 l min aeration and hrt of 5 days has removed 99 3 of ibuprofen 88 2 of cod 99 1 of ammonia 72 9 of nitrate nitrogen and 83 2 of orthophosphate with effluent successfully met the effluent standard b set by malaysian government therefore the vssfcw planted with s grossus becomes a technically feasible method for treating sewage containing pharmaceutical compounds keywords emerging contaminants pharmaceutical scirpus grossus vssfcw wastewater treatment 1 introduction pharmaceutical residues in wastewater pose a challenge for wastewater treatment technology domestic sewage pharmaceutical industries hospital and landfill leachate are several sources for pharmaceutical compounds found in the environment 1 among that origins anthropogenic activities played major role in the release of pharmaceutical compounds 2 3 human is the main contributor to the availability of the pharmaceutical compounds in domestic wastewater residual pharmaceutical compounds normally taken by human as medicine will be released as metabolic products with urine and feces 4 6 the utilization of herbicides and insecticides also contributes to the existence of pharmaceutical components in surface water 7 9 pharmaceutical components in environment may spark several problems 3 some pharmaceutical compounds exhibit chronic effect and even acute lethal effect to certain organisms 8 10 antibiotics one type of pharmaceutical compounds are also considered as emerging concern in the field of environmental pollution 11 12 the existence of antibiotics in the environment poses harmful effect for organisms antibiotics existence can generate new gene of antibiotic resistant expression 13 that subsequently may create new antibiotic resistant strain of microorganisms 14 antibiotic resistant microorganisms can cause further problem especially for human health diseases caused by antibiotic resistant microorganisms will be harder to be cured as compared to the commonly disease related microorganisms 15 ibuprofen is one type of pharmaceutical compounds found in the wastewater 16 it is a common painkiller used to treat aches fever and pains 17 and also reduces inflammation ibuprofen and any other pharmaceuticals in domestic wastewater are originated from human excreta and disposal of expired unused drugs into sewerage systems 18 19 the other sources may come from landfills for expired drugs and improper effluent treatment in pharmaceutical industries combination of ibuprofen is also being used in remediating cold and influenzas commonly ibuprofen is sold without prescription under several trademarks 19 20 several researchers reported the negative impacts of ibuprofen existence in environment geiger et al 21 reported the decreasing algal population density caused by the exposure of ibuprofen similarly moro et al 22 also claimed the alteration of structure and ultra skeleton of scenedesmus rubescens after 30 days exposure of ibuprofen in addition a significantly decreasing number of eggs of daphnia manga was noticed only after 6 hour exposure to 50 μg l of ibuprofen 23 adsorption 24 and filtration 23 are the common technology used for treating ibuprofen as water contaminant while electrocoagulation ozonation and photocatalytic has also emerged as alternative technology 24 26 physical treatment like filtration removed the ibuprofen by its particle size while adsorption and electrocoagulation removed ibuprofen by its charge chemical coagulation and flocculation is also evident to treat ibuprofen in water wastewater 27 despite the reliable efficiency of the above mentioned technologies there is a concern on the used chemicals and treatment residues that might cause further pollution to the environment 28 30 in addition chemical treatment also generates abundant amount of sludge which requires further handling 27 31 the high consumption of energy and high operational cost by applying these technologies also need to be considered 27 32 to comprise these issues biological treatment using wetland becomes a very promising technology to treat ibuprofen contaminated water among biological treatment methods constructed wetland cw is the most promising technology to be applied in treating ibuprofen contaminated water 16 33 34 cw mimics the natural phenomenon of filtration degradation and uptake of pollutants 35 36 a horizontal sub surface cw planted with thypa angustifolia showed the efficiency of ibuprofen removal up to 70 through complex plant microbes medium interactions with aeration supply had promoted the removal of ibuprofen by enhancing the aerobic bacteria growth which played important roles in the degradation of ibuprofen in wastewater 10 in addition zhang et al 37 also mentioned that different hydraulic retention time hrt affected the removal kinetics of pharmaceutical components in cw based on many conducted studies 38 40 the results showed that hrt between 2 and 7 days is the most applicable depending on the pollutant concentrations loading and the capability of plant species the utilization of plants showed a significant increment of ibuprofen removal as compared to the non planted system indicating the importance of plants for the degradation of ibuprofen in wetland 16 another study showed the performance of vertical free flow cw planted with eichhornia crassipes and heliconia rostrata in treating ibuprofen in wastewater with removal value up to 89 17 following the emergence of the pharmaceutical compounds inside wastewater originating from atherogenic activities 41 research conducted on the simultaneous removal of nutrients and ibuprofen from domestic wastewater is not widely conducted yet scirpus grossus is a native plant species in tropical countries which exhibits great performance of organic and nutrient removal in domestic wastewater using cw 36 42 44 this species was chosen based on its great performance in removing pollutant in domestic wastewater it was able to remove up to 90 of cod from domestic wastewater 43 while another research 45 mentioned its capability to achieve an average of 69 for bod removal this species also had demonstrated good performance for nutrient removal from domestic wastewater with values reaching 84 7 of nh4 n 38 3 no3 n 71 0 of po4 p and 61 2 po4 3 42 45 looking at the performance of this species and the emerging of pharmaceutical compounds especially ibuprofen in domestic wastewater an opportunity to conduct a research of ibuprofen containing domestic wastewater using cw planted with s grossus is considered applicable hence its performance in treating pharmaceutical compound especially ibuprofen is awaiting to be explored further moreover most of the current treatment of ibuprofen in wastewater is through adsorption and filtration and yet they are conducted at laboratory scale 23 24 while the utilization of pilot scale cw planted with native plants under different hrt and aeration systems is currently still limited understanding the potential of cw this research aimed to analyze the simultaneous removal of ibuprofen chemical oxygen demand cod and nutrients nh3 n no3 n and po4 p from domestic wastewater using pilot scale vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland vssfcw planted with s grossus under different hrt and aeration rates this setup was also used to analyze the capability of s grossus in treating ibuprofen since research on ibuprofen treatment using s grossus is currently limited the presented result is targeted to contribute to the knowledge of alternative environmentally friendly technology to treat pharmaceutical containing wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and plant source this study was conducted in an open natural environment in a greenhouse at universiti kebangsaan malaysia ukm three pilot scale vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland vssfcw were operated at 30 5 c ambient temperature the dimensions of the subfloor wetland reactors were 1 m width 1 m length 60 cm height 0 5 cm thickness to accommodate a total of 45 l of wastewater three reactors with similar sand gravel layers made of fiberglass were used the height of the layers of sand from the bottom upward was i 15 cm of gravel 10 20 mm in diameter ii 5 cm of fine sand 2 mm in diameter and iii 1 cm of gravel 1 5 mm in diameter with total sand weight of 77 kg inlet and outlet flows were secured with gravel 22 5 cm thickness ɸ of 10 20 mm schematic diagram and real reactor setup can be seen in fig 1a and b the plants scirpus grossus used in this research were collected from tasik chini pahang malaysia fig 1c it is a native tropical bulrush under the family of cyperaceae which is categorized as emergent plant that is commonly found in swamp area 31 like tasik chini the second biggest freshwater lake in malaysia at the initial stage of research work healthy 30 day old plants were acclimatized into the sand medium before the second generation were used with all the plants were propagated at the ukm greenhouse all the plants used in the main research were already acclimatized for 30 days 46 each vssfcw was planted with 20 acclimatized s grossus plants three identical wetland reactor systems were set to run without aeration and with aeration of 1 and 2 l min in different cycle each reactor was designed to run in a continuous mode with different flow rates of 15 l day 11 25 l day and 9 l day producing hrt of 3 4 and 5 days each vssfcw was flowed with sewage for 30 days before introducing ibuprofen containing wastewater to create a stable cw ecosystem these systems were then running continuously for a research period of 21 days to treat ibuprofen containing wastewater 2 2 wastewater source characteristics and parameter analysis domestic wastewater was collected from bukit puteri area bangi malaysia wastewater was collected from a collecting tank that accommodates 100 number of households initial characteristics of collected wastewater were ph 7 5 chemical oxygen demand cod 182 7 1 5 mg l nh3 n 42 7 6 5 mg l no3 n 7 5 1 6 mg l and po4 p 30 7 10 mg l the simulated ibuprofen containing domestic wastewater was prepared at an initial ibuprofen concentration of 600 μg l ibuprofen concentration was prepared by diluting ibuprofen powder merck germany to the collected domestic wastewater 47 the addition of ibuprofen was carried out to accommodate the highest concentration of this compound that ever analyzed from the wastewater the concentration of pharmaceutical compounds varies by day in domestic wastewater while during the sample taken it was measured in a very low concentration parameters ibuprofen cod nh3 n no3 n po4 p were analyzed on days 0 3 12 and 21 on each day three samples of water 500 ml were taken from each vssfcw outlet sand sample 10 g was also taken near the outlet on each sampling day immediately after sampling was completed the sand for ibuprofen analysis was extracted ultrasonically epa method 3550c with a solvent extraction method 48 using ultrasonic irradiation producing oscillating cavitation bubbles and shockwaves that can break the sand particle aggregates and enhance separation of target contaminants from the sand surface 49 this method can consequently reach the inner space of the sand structure 50 chemical oxygen demand cod was measured spectrophotometrically by a spectrophotometer dr3900 hach usa using test kits according to the manufacturer s instruction the ammoniacal nitrogen nh3 n content was determined using nessler reagent followed with hach dr3900 spectrophotometer reading 51 nitrate nitrogen no3 n and orthophosphate po4 p were measured using hach dr3900 spectrophotometer the extracted ibuprofen was processed further through solid phase extraction spe jones chromatography usa using 200 mg 6 ml oasis hlb extraction cartridges waters corporation massachusetts usa to concentrate the ibuprofen levels in the water sample the hlb cartridges were preconditioned using 3 ml of acetonitrile 3 ml of methanol and 3 ml of deionized water at ph 2 the sample was then percolated through a cartridge at a controlled flow rate with a vacuum manifold after percolation the hlb cartridge was rinsed with 10 ml of deionized water and the eluent was discarded after percolation and left 1 h 52 the analyte was eluted with 4 ml of acetonitrile and collected in a vial for hplc measurement the eluted sample was measured with hplc agilent 1200 series usa for ibuprofen determination through a standard curve calibration using a zorbax c18 column 250 mm 4 6 mm and 5 mm at a uv wavelength of 230 nm the mobile phases used were methanol and water at a ratio of 60 40 with a flow rate of 1 l min 2 3 statistical data analysis data were statistically analyzed using spss 21 spss inc usa all obtained data was tested for homogeneity and normality 53 which turned out to be homogeny and normally distributed two way analysis of variance anova was then conducted to examine the correlation between the removal efficiency of parameters ibuprofen cod nh3 n no3 n and po4 p with the experimental factors hrt exposure period aeration post hoc tests were performed using tukey s hsd test for significant factor after anova to determine the significant difference between the obtained results among factors to the response 54 in which conclusion of significant difference was drawn at p 0 05 55 3 results and discussion 3 1 ibuprofen removal from wastewater result of two way anova analysis for the ibuprofen removal is tabulated in table s1 table s1 shows that hrt exposure period and aeration gave significant effect to the ibuprofen removal from wastewater p 0 05 interaction between factors also gave significant effect to the ibuprofen removal the concentrations of ibuprofen in the wastewater sample throughout the research period are shown in fig 2 in all vertical sub surface flow constructed wetland vssfcw reactors the concentration of ibuprofen decreased throughout the research period the following values were obtained after 21 days of treatment 54 7 μg l 34 7 47 7 μg l 47 and 34 7 μg l 56 6 for respective hrt of 3 4 and 5 days in non aerated system 24 μg l 72 6 17 μg l 80 5 and 9 μg l 89 5 for hrt of 3 4 and 5 days respectively in 1 l min reactor 9 μg l 89 6 6 7 μg l 91 9 and 0 6 μg l 99 3 for respective hrt of 3 4 and 5 days in 2 l min reactor according to fig 2 the measured ibuprofen in wastewater was already reduced from the prepared concentration starting from day 0 first day water out from the outlet the reduced concentration starting from day 0 was subjected due to the filtration mechanism by the sand medium and the root of scirpus grossus ibuprofen may be attached to the sand matrix via adsorption mechanism during the filtration through sand medium 56 57 discussed further in section 3 2 in all treatment reactors hrt of 5 days showed significantly higher performance in ibuprofen removal as compared to other hrt p 0 05 longer hrt create a better filtration mechanism of ibuprofen by the medium and rhizosphere of s grossus 58 the longer hrt gave longer time for ibuprofen to contact with the treatment agent in which biological process may perform better 59 61 this obtained result confirmed the previous result by ejhed et al 61 in which longer hrt performed better removal of pharmaceutical compounds as compared to the shorter hrt due to the higher degradation by microbial community in accordance with hrt longer exposure period also showed a better removal it indicated that reactors had improved their performance after longer contact with the pollutants as similarly discovered by other studies 36 62 similarly the increasing of aeration gave significant effect to the ibuprofen removal p 0 05 the addition of aeration showed significant difference in removal as compared to the non aerated system while the highest performance was obtained on 2 l min aeration system oxygen provides better redox environment for aerobic bacteria in the rhizosphere area to oxidize ibuprofen while plants can adsorb the degraded compounds more easily 52 63 64 bioaccumulation uptake by plants and translocation of degraded pharmaceutical compounds is higher due to the lower hydrophobicity characteristics of the intermediate compounds such as carboxy and hydroxy ibuprofen 65 as compared to the original ibuprofen structure 66 67 combination of 2 l min aeration and hrt of 5 days performed 99 removal of ibuprofen from the initial concentration as comparison nivala et al 68 exhibited only 79 24 removal of ibuprofen compounds using sub surface flow wetland nivala et al 68 also revealed the importance of aeration to enhance the growth of aerobic microbial community that contribute significantly to the degradation of this compound 3 2 ibuprofen concentration in sand medium medium becomes an important part in vssfcw since it acts as filter and carrier for the microorganism growth during treatment 35 36 69 adsorption of ibuprofen in the sand matrix is the mechanism subjected to occur during this study 56 57 the factors of hrt exposure period and aeration gave significant impact to the decreasing of ibuprofen concentration in sand medium after 21 days of treatment p 0 05 result of two way anova analysis for the ibuprofen concentration in sand medium is tabulated in table s2 results showed that the concentration of ibuprofen in sand medium at day 0 of treatment were high reaching up to 147 8 17 4 μg g fig 3 this obtained result confirmed that ibuprofen was significantly reduced from wastewater even at day 0 due to the adsorption by sand and plant s root matrix high ibuprofen concentration in sand at day 0 was obtained due to the retained particle during filtration by sand medium and the root of s grossus the concentration of ibuprofen then decreased throughout the research period fig 3 the decreasing ibuprofen concentration in the sand matrix showed that degradation of ibuprofen by microorganism in medium and root area had occurred during this study ibuprofen concentration in sand in all treatment reactors after 21 days of treatment were 34 7 38 7 23 3 μg g for hrt of 3 4 and 5 days respectively in non aerated system 18 17 3 14 9 μg g for respective hrt of 3 4 and 5 days in 1 l min reactor 2 5 3 3 2 3 μg g for hrt of 3 4 and 5 days respectively in 2 l min reactor the longer the hrt the lower ibuprofen concentration after 21 days of treatment similar to ibuprofen in wastewater longer contact of pollutant with treatment agent has resulted in better removal performance 42 in accordance with hrt the longer exposure period also showed lower ibuprofen concentration the decreasing ibuprofen concentration in sand medium throughout the research period was due to the degradation by microorganism while the degraded compounds were subjected to be accumulated by plants 59 61 this mechanism was assured by the decrease of both ibuprofen concentration in sand medium and also in the outlet giving evidence that uptake mechanism phytoaccumulation by plants occurred during the treatment 70 71 by providing sufficient contact time plants can perform extraction of ibuprofen and or intermediate compounds i e hydroxy ibuprofen 1 2 dihydroxy ibuprofen carboxy ibuprofen and glucopyranosyloxy hydroxy ibuprofen 65 72 73 after degradation by microbes or plants exudates thus completely removing it from the sand matrix 10 74 the degradation of ibuprofen compounds in sand and plant s root matrix was also supported by the aerobic condition proven by the lower ibuprofen concentration in the aerated reactors as compared to the non aerated reactors 68 75 providing more oxygen has also positively boosted the degradation of ibuprofen compound which 2 l min reactors showed significantly lower ibuprofen concentration after 21 days of treatment as compared to 1 l min reactors p 0 05 higher aeration rate boosts the growth of aerobic microorganism in medium and creates a better redox condition for bacteria to completely degrade pharmaceutical compounds 76 77 filtration and adsorption mechanisms of ibuprofen compound by sand medium matrix were hypothesized to occur in the initial phase of the research then accompanied by the high decay rate of this compound inside the system thus decreasing the concentration of ibuprofen in both wastewater and sand medium to support this hypothesis sand adsorption capacity and first order decay rate were calculated based on the measured concentration of ibuprofen in sand medium the adsorption capacity was calculated by referring to the formula provided by li et al 78 eq 1 while the decay rate of ibuprofen from sand was calculated using half time first order equation following the formula from ahmed 79 eq 2 the adsorption capacity was calculated from the decreasing concentration of ibuprofen from wastewater while the decay rate was calculated from the decreasing concentration of ibuprofen in sand medium both data will be fitted to the following expressions 1 q t c o c t v m 2 ln c t ln c o kt where q t is adsorption capacity at t time μg kg co is initial concentration of ibuprofen 600 μg l ct is concentration of ibuprofen at t time μg l v is the total volume of wastewater in reactor 45 l k is decay rate 1 day and t is time d the result of adsorption capacity calculation is tabulated in table 1 while summary of r 2 and k for the decay rate calculation are summarized in table 2 additional data for the linearization of data based on eq 2 are provided in table s3 based on the calculated adsorption capacity it can be seen that adsorption of ibuprofen had already occurred since day 0 of the treatment the first time wastewater flow through the outlet this obtained result confirmed the observation of ibuprofen concentration in sand medium even at day 0 of the research period the adsorption capacity of sand increased during the 21 days of observation indicating that ibuprofen was accumulated in the sand matrix from the continuous adsorption throughout the research period 80 this result was in contrast with the measured concentration of ibuprofen in sand in which it shows decreasing trend in all reactors the result of decay rate calculation showed that the higher applied aeration the greater decay rate constant k obtained indicating that other mechanisms like degradation and uptake rather than only adsorption by sand medium were involved during the treatment 81 the decay rate analysis showed that a greater value in the highly aerated system suggested to be the evidence of the increasing activity of the aerobic bacteria inside the system 82 confirming the result of the decreasing concentration of ibuprofen in sand medium despite the applied aeration hrt also plays role in providing contact of bacterial community to ibuprofen while also retains ibuprofen particle longer in the sand matrix providing more effective filtration and adsorption of ibuprofen compounds 80 the highest removal percentage of ibuprofen was in accordance with the biggest adsorption capacity and the decay rate obtained in the 2 l min aerated system at hrt of 5 days 3 3 ibuprofen concentration in plants in cw removal of organic pollutant can occur from the degradation of microorganism existing in the medium and also the uptake by plants to prove that s grossus had played a role in the ibuprofen removal from wastewater extraction of ibuprofen was carried out from roots and shoots of s grossus which results are depicted in fig 4 and the results of anova can be seen in table s4 based on fig 4 it can be seen that plants absorb ibuprofen in all treatment reactor the variation of hrt gave significant differences to the concentration of ibuprofen in plants with hrt 5 showing significantly higher ibuprofen concentration as compared to other hrt the variations of aeration also gave significant differences to the ibuprofen concentration p 0 05 there was an increasing trend of ibuprofen concentration in both roots and shoots of s grossus throughout the research period indicating that bioaccumulation of this compound had occurred 83 the increasing aeration to 2 l min clearly gave a significant increase to the adsorbed ibuprofen suggesting that aeration may boost the rhizobacterial community to interact with the plants to perform phytoextraction 84 results also suggest that the fate of ibuprofen inside plants was more likely to be bioaccumulated in the root part of plants but different trend was obtained on the 2 l min aeration the 2 l min aeration showed higher ibuprofen concentration in shoot part suggesting that the increasing of aeration did not only promote the phytoextraction but also increase the translocation of the ibuprofen compound to the aerial part of s grossus plants the increasing ibuprofen translocation was subjected to occur due to the boost of rhizobacterial growth which then performed interaction with plants to enhance the compounds solubility resulting in the higher transport to the aerial part 66 85 3 4 chemical oxygen demand cod removal from wastewater chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations were considered to be high in the influent up to 182 67 1 51 mg l the cod concentration was contributed from pollutants in domestic wastewater and also the introduced ibuprofen results of two way anova table s5 showed that all factors hrt exposure period and aeration and the interaction between factors significantly affected the response cod removal p 0 05 conversely the effluent concentrations after 21 days of treatment were 119 mg l 35 1 85 5 mg l 53 1 and 81 9 mg l 55 for hrt of 3 4 and 5 days respectively in non aerated system 65 9 mg l 64 1 50 2 mg l 80 and 50 2 mg l 72 4 for respective hrt of 3 4 and 5 days in 1 l min reactor 13 3 μg l 92 6 10 3 μg l 94 4 and 22 μg l 88 2 for hrt of 3 4 and 5 days respectively in 2 l min reactor fig 5 furthermore the results show that all vssfcw systems with aeration were more reliable than without aerated system for cod removal in accordance with hasan et al 52 and ong et al 86 cod removal was significantly improved by the addition of aeration into the system p 0 05 longer hrt showed better cod removal performance due to the increase of pollutants with treatment agent 87 88 but hrt of 4 days showed significantly higher removal among other hrts microbial degradation is responsible to the removal of organic materials in constructed wetland cw 43 89 90 the sand medium and the plant root system provide an excellent condition for microbial community to attach and grow 69 91 92 the addition of aeration significantly improved the degradation of cod from wastewater p 0 05 oxygen is the major component needed for aerobic bacteria to grow when simultaneously utilizing organic materials as their carbon source for biomass growth resulting in the degradation of cod 63 88 93 the oxygen rich rhizosphere can also enhance the microbial degradation of organic pollutants from wastewater 43 higher cod removal obtained on hrt of 4 days as compared to hrt of 5 days may due to the limited available nutrient for bacteria growth which were responsible for the cod degradation 94 95 bacteria growth needs certain ratio of carbon nitrogen and phosphate for cell growth 94 96 97 limited available nitrogen was subjected to be the reason behind the decreasing cod removal on hrt 5 decay rate was calculated following eq 2 and tabulated in tables s6 and s7 to enhance the aforementioned statement based on the decay rate constant it can also be concluded that the higher aeration applied has resulted increment to the degradation of cod inside the system similar to the data obtained in fig 5 hrt of 4 days with 2 l min aeration gave higher decay rate as compared to the hrt of 5 days with 2 l min aeration this was an indication of limited growth of bacterial community which contributes to the degradation of organic materials 98 limited growth of bacteria may occur due to the limited nutrient n and p availability 94 inside the system to be discussed further in section 3 5 3 5 ammoniacal nitrogen nh3 n removal ammoniacal nitrogen concentrations were considered to be high in the influent up to 42 7 6 5 mg l two way anova analysis shows that exposure period and aeration gave significant effect to the response nh3 n removal p 0 05 while variation of hrt did not significantly affect the nh3 n removal p 0 05 table s8 the ammonia effluent concentrations were 10 mg l 66 7 14 mg l 60 and 20 mg l 55 6 for hrt of 3 4 and 5 days respectively in non aerated system 0 1 mg l 99 7 0 3 mg l 99 2 and 0 1 mg l 99 7 for hrt of 3 4 and 5 days respectively in 1 l min aeration system 0 2 mg l 99 6 0 4 mg l 99 2 and 0 4 mg l 99 1 for hrt of 3 4 and 5 days respectively fig 6 all vssfcw used in these experiments had positive ammonia reduction trends suggesting that the microbial community and plants were performing the ammonia removal 39 99 ammonia removal in cw was facilitated by the microbial degradation nitrification and plant uptake plants need nitrogen as their nutrient for growth 100 the addition of aeration clearly shows the significant improvement of ammonia removal aerated vs non aerated vssfcw p 0 05 ammonia can be removed from wastewater via nitrification mechanism thus eliminating it from the ammonia reading 44 101 high ammonia removal was subjected to the nitrification mechanism by nitrifying bacteria in the sand medium and root area of s grossus 102 the addition of aeration provides oxygen for the transformation of ammonia into nitrate or nitrite via microbial degradation 103 104 and subsequently being up taken by plants there is no significant difference between 1 and 2 l min aeration p 0 05 suggesting that 1 l min is enough to transform most of ammonia concentration in wastewater there is also no significant difference of ammonia removal in various hrts p 0 05 suggesting that ammonia removal was more related to the availability of oxygen in the system all aerated system achieved 99 of ammonia removal from wastewater this obtained result was in accordance with previous researches 105 107 which stated that the addition of aeration into the constructed wetland system significantly escalates the ammonia removal the obtained results showed that 1 l min of aeration with hrt of 3 days can remove ammonia 99 suggesting that longer hrt or increasing of aeration did not contribute to the addition of ammonia removal this phenomenon might be the reason of better cod removal in hrt of 4 days in which ammonia became the limiting factor of bacteria growth resulting in no addition of cod removal in longer hrt 94 95 98 the obtained results were in accordance with the calculated decay rate tables s9 and s10 which shows that the applied aeration gave increment to the decay rate the calculated decay rate also shows that 1 l min aeration gave higher rate as compared to the 2 l min aeration confirming that the 1 l min was sufficient to degrade the available nh3 n the decreasing decay rate in 2 l min aeration indicated the limited available nh3 n to be degraded further 94 3 6 nitrate nitrogen no3 n removal similar to nh3 n removal trend variation of hrt did not affect the no3 n removal significantly p 0 05 while the addition of aeration significantly increased the no3 n removal p 0 05 table s11 fig 7 shows the inlet and outlet concentrations of no3 n in all vssfcw system the influent concentration was 7 5 1 6 mg l the nitrate nitrogen effluent concentrations were 4 mg l 57 1 5 mg l 45 8 and 6 mg l 40 for hrt of 3 4 and 5 days respectively in non aerated system 2 mg l 71 4 1 8 mg l 70 and 2 2 mg l 66 6 for hrt of 3 4 and 5 days respectively in 1 l min reactor 0 3 mg l 96 6 0 5 mg l 91 5 and 1 4 mg l 72 9 for hrt of 3 4 and 5 days respectively in 2 l min reactor the longer the exposure period the more no3 n removal obtained indicating that the reactors improved the performance along the study period 36 42 62 degradation of nitrate supposed to occur under anoxic or anaerobic degradation while in this study nitrate nitrogen removal was subjected to occur by plant uptake the provided aeration enhanced the growth of bacteria in rhizosphere which can accelerate the uptake of no3 n by plants due to the promoted plant growth by bacteria plant interaction 95 108 109 this obtained result also confirmed the previous researches that nitrate nitrogen removal was more related to the oxygen availability in the system 99 106 110 referring to the calculated decay rate tables s12 and s13 and fig 7 the increasing hrt did not give improvement to the decay rate the highest decay rate obtained in hrt of 3 days with an aeration of 2 l min treatment period shows more effect to the no3 n removal due to the system stability and the growth of plants inside the cw the plant growth requires nutrients thus increasing the uptake of no3 n from the system 95 since the removal of no3 n occurred under anoxic or anaerobic condition the decreasing of this compound in this study was subjected to the plant uptake mechanism which was further expedited by the interaction of aerobic bacteria and plant root s system 92 3 7 orthophosphate po4 p removal the vssfcw had exhibited good performance of phosphate removal similar to ammoniacal nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen removal trend two way anova analysis also showed that exposure period and aeration gave significant effect to the po4 p removal p 0 05 while hrt did not contribute significantly p 0 05 table s14 fig 8 shows the concentration of orthophosphate in all vssfcw reactors throughout the research period initial concentration of orthophosphate in the system was 30 7 10 mg l the measured effluent were 13 mg l 48 16 mg l 40 7 and 14 5 mg l 37 for hrt of 3 4 and 5 days respectively in non aerated system 8 9 mg l 64 4 8 3 mg l 67 and 8 mg l 55 6 for hrt of 3 4 and 5 days respectively in 1 l min reactor 13 3 mg l 69 2 15 1 mg l 67 8 and 7 2 mg l 83 2 for hrt of 3 4 and 5 days respectively in 2 l min reactor referring to fig 8 and the results of decay rate calculation tables s15 and s16 the addition of aeration had improved the po4 p removal from the system while the increment of hrt did not significantly improve the po4 p removal the highest removal and decay rate of orthophosphate was obtained in reactor with 2 l min aeration at hrt of 5 days removal of orthophosphate inside the system was subjected to be extracted by s grossus as plants need adequate amount of n and p as nutrient source 111 113 removal of phosphate by bacteria called biological phosphate removal requires sequential anaerobic aerobic condition to completely transform soluble p from wastewater into biomass 114 while this study only conducted one condition non aerated or aerated thus plant uptake became the major contributor in the orthophosphate removal the longer the exposure period the higher orthophosphate removal obtained giving evidence that reactors had improved their quality and stability throughout the research period 36 42 62 increment of phosphate uptake by the addition of aeration to vssfcw was obtained due to the enhancement of microbial growth in rhizosphere of s grossus which later perform positive correlation with plant s root that may stimulate the nutrient uptake by plants 94 95 108 the highest po4 p removal was obtained under 2 l min aeration in hrt of 5 days with value reaching up to 83 2 3 8 overall performance evaluation the utilized vssfcw with 21 days operation period performed very well in removing pollutants from wastewater the highest ibuprofen removal was obtained under 2 l min aeration condition with hrt of 5 days reaching up to 99 3 the lowest ibuprofen concentration in sand medium after 21 days was obtained on the same reactor 2 l min aeration and hrt of 5 days with a value of 2 3 μg g cod removal trend was slightly different from ibuprofen in which its highest removal obtained on hrt of 4 days with 2 l min aeration with value reaching up to 94 4 variations of hrt showed no significant different in all nutrient nh3 n no3 n and po4 p removals p 0 05 while the addition of aeration significantly affects the nutrient removals p 0 05 the highest ammoniacal nitrogen removal was 99 7 in hrt of 3 and 5 days under 1 l min aeration but there is also no significantly difference with 2 l min aeration p 0 05 for nitrate nitrogen the highest removal was obtained under hrt of 3 days and 2 l min aeration with a value of 96 6 but there are insignificant differences with other hrt p 0 05 for orthophosphate parameter the highest removal was obtained under hrt of 5 days and 2 l min aeration with value of 83 2 the vssfcw with 2 l min showed a promising performance while hrt of 4 days showed the highest removal of cod and hrt of 5 days showed the highest removal of ibuprofen to compare the performance of these vssfcw a comparison with the standard limit set by department of environment malaysia 115 are presented in table 3 the utilized vssfcw with 2 l min aeration and hrt of 5 days success in fulfilling all standard b thus the effluent after treatment can be discharged into non closed surface water for non drinking raw water source river the ibuprofen concentration in effluent after treatment with 2 l min and hrt of 5 days was even lower than the effluent standard a 5 μg l but the orthophosphate concentration still above 5 mg l in order to fulfill all required parameters for standard a discharge into closed surface water for raw drinking water source enhanced biological phosphate removal should be provided 114 117 to obtain orthophosphate concentration below the maximum limit of standard a combination of plants that have high uptake of phosphate may also be utilized in order to reduce the treated orthophosphate concentration 118 119 4 conclusions simultaneous removal of ibuprofen organic materials cod and nutrients nh3 n no3 n and po4 p can be accomplished by the utilization of vertical sub surface flow constructed wetland vssfcw filtration and adsorption mechanisms of ibuprofen compound by sand medium matrix were observed by solid phase extraction method in the beginning of the research period the concentration of ibuprofen in sand and effluent were gradually reduced throughout the study period suggesting that microbial degradation and plant uptake mechanisms occurred simultaneously inside the systems aeration provided significant improvement for all parameters p 0 05 while longer hrt significantly improves the ibuprofen and cod removals p 0 05 the vssfcw showed the highest removal of ibuprofen up to 99 3 at hrt of 5 days with 2 l min aeration after 21 days of treatment this system also showed reduction of cod up to 88 2 ammoniacal nitrogen up to 99 1 nitrate nitrogen of 72 9 and orthophosphate of 83 2 the treatment effluent using vssfcw under this set up met the effluent standard b set by malaysian government enhanced biological phosphate removal ebpr and combination of plants that can uptake high

13334,in this work the total water involved in a bottled water model plant was estimated total water footprint wf including blue grey and indirect components were calculated for three setting boundaries inner process middle product and outer industry total wf was obtained as the sum of the direct operational and the indirect supply chain wf then five hypothetical scenarios with regard to the base case were examined to find alternatives for wf reduction in wf terms total water use involved in the entire plant was 600 higher than the amount directly consumed blue the indirect wf component contributed the most to the total in all boundaries 64 78 due to energy consumption and raw materials blue and grey components were the highest in the inner due to bottles filling and detergent use hypothetical scenarios showed us that wf values can change among established boundaries which would directly impact on decision making based upon the priorities set by the stakeholders for example if business wants to increase production while minimizing water use it should aim to reduce the wf of the middle boundary conversely if the goal is to reach an environmental and social commitment the plant should consider reducing the wf of the outer boundary to reduce the electrical energy usage or to replace tap with groundwater defining boundaries for wf calculation is a smart tool to distinguish critical sectors so that business could decide where and how to apply or not actions towards more efficient production graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords bottled water plant boundaries water footprint scenarios analysis 1 introduction it has been predicted that water scarcity and pollution will become greater problems in the future due to the increase of water demand and the decrease in its quality 1 in 2050 this scarcity will affect two thirds of the world s population due to excessive water use mainly for food production 2 seventy percent of water in the world is used in agriculture 22 in industry and 8 in households 3 even though the amount of water required for the industrial sector is lower than for agriculture the former will soon compete for this limited resource in a world with an accelerated urban growth and rising food demand 1 4 furthermore water use for effluent treatment and for final disposal of these effluents in natural water bodies is becoming the main source responsible for pollution of large volumes of water 5 6 those industries without policies for sustainable water management will probably no longer remain in the market due to regulatory and social pressures to collaborate with rational and sustainable decision making regarding water use virtual water and water footprint wf concepts appeared in the water market virtual water represents the volume of water required for agricultural or industrial product manufacture 7 while the wf is a multidimensional indicator that considers the origin the source and the time when water is used before being returned to its source or elsewhere it allows one to measure the volume of freshwater directly or indirectly used by a system such as a process a product a geographic region or a business 8 the use of the wf allows one to verify the impact of human activities on aquatic resources to have a better understanding of scarcity and pollution problems 4 this indicator is a valuable tool for business as it will allow to know the real quantity of water consumed which is crucial when trying to produce goods in a more efficient and or eco friendly way this will not only have a direct impact on water saving and environmental sustainability but also on reducing costs food and beverage industries are responsible for the world s largest water consumption footprint as most of them use raw materials of agricultural origin for their processes this sector is the one with the highest wf 9 beverage industries without raw materials of agricultural origin could also have high wfs due to other reasons in fact before calculating the wf boundaries should be established throughout the industry where inputs and outputs are perfectly known 8 hence an industry could be identified as a group of business units that consider all the processes and consumptions involved 8 identification of the opportunities to improve the use of water over the short or long term would be simplified by use of the wf as long as this value is not only expressed per unit of product but also per unit of time several researchers have calculated the wf for different bottled beverage industries such as sugary beer and wine among others 10 13 but have just focused on the wf per unit of product while this is a valuable piece of data sometimes just looking at the results in the same unit for all defined boundaries per unit of product as most cases hinders visualization of how much water is really used in a day week month or year in addition if the cost of water is not considered they will not be able to see how much money they are saving in the same period of time regarding bottled water which could be considered as the simplest of the bottled beverages due to fewer raw materials involved there are only a few published studies carried out for this business 14 16 in all these studies the wf was only calculated per unit of product which is useful for data interpretation but not enough when the goal is to know the use of water in the whole plant bottled water has increased its production around world as people associate it with a healthy lifestyle while distrusting the quality of drinking water produced by conventional processes 17 it is estimated that bottled water consumption per capita reached a global average of approximately 50 l bottled water y in 2017 28 more than in 2012 39 l bottled water y 18 fifteen percent of global bottled water sales occurred in latin america 19 with mexico and brazil the main suppliers these two countries reported an approximate consumption of 254 l bottled water y 1st position in the global bottled water consumption per capita and 105 l bottled water y 15th position per capita respectively in parallel with the increasing bottled water demand and the wide variety of bottled beverages there is also a rising concern due to plastic wastes that are not adequately disposed of around the world causing serious environmental problems the efficient use of water associated with plastics manufacturing and production is another important issue that needs to be considered thinking in wf terms it is quite possible that the total amount of water used in these industries may be higher than expected making it an inefficient process the aims of this study were to estimate the total amount of water involved in a bottled water plant selected as model and to identify the most critical points or sectors regarding water use first we set three boundaries the process inner the product middle and the industry outer then the water footprint indicator including the blue grey and indirect was calculated for all of them finally based on these results five hypothetical scenarios were examined to find the most appropriate alternatives for water footprint reduction 2 materials and methods a standard bottled water plant was selected as model and boundaries were set within it after that the use of water was assessed by implementing the wf concept developed by hoekstra and collaborators 8 the annual production of this plant was estimated in 3 15 106 l of bottled water y 15 000 l of bottled water d the plant needs 1 5 l of freshwater to produce 1 l of bottled water considering leaks and water contained in the product then the product is packaged and delivered in returnable bottles of 20 l 2 1 description of industrial process the main raw material of this process is tap water obtained from the public distribution network other supplies such as pet polyethylene terephthalate plastic caps and labels are also needed for the packaging step to ensure the correct application of the wf concept each step of the process was described and analyzed in detail fig 1 the process was divided into five operational steps fig 1 initially tap water is stored in two stainless steel tanks feed tanks then it is pumped through a sand filter an activated carbon column to remove flavors and odors and a softening column to eliminate ions such as ca2 mg2 and fe2 a fraction of the filtered water is used to wash the 20 l plastic containers in the washing step while the rest is subjected to a disinfection process fig 1 two operations ozonation and addition of cu2 ag and zn2 ions are used to ensure the inactivation of microorganisms that may be present disinfected water is finally poured into 20 l plastic containers these containers as they are returnable are washed in two stages before reuse internally with chlorine based detergent and externally with sanitizing agent that contains hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid after that they are rinsed with filtered water using a spray system filled with disinfected water which is the final product capped and labeled in the packaging step fig 1 damaged plastic containers and labels are replaced with the daily replacement rate at 0 004 for bottles and 0 085 for labels once the process is finished all the equipment and pipes are cleaned using compressed air 2 2 definition of boundaries and assumptions for water footprint calculation the wf calculated here included all the volumes of freshwater used by the model plant and was performed according to the water footprint assessment manual 8 unavailable data were obtained from literature table 2 the wf is defined by three main components or colors blue grey and green 8 the blue wf is referred to the consumption of blue water resources either surface or groundwater this concept includes water loss due to evaporation water that does not return to the original basin and is therefore disposed of into a waterbody receptor river sea dam and or water that is incorporated into a product the grey wf is the volume of freshwater required to assimilate the contaminant loads present in the effluent to reach the limit values established by legislation prior to its final disposal 8 the green wf considers the consumption of green water resources rainwater that did not become runoff but was incorporated into agricultural products 8 to analyze in detail the different sectors of the plant and thus reach a better interpretation of the results three boundaries were defined as follows the inner one representing the process in l d which includes all the operation steps described before fig 1 the middle boundary indicating the product l l of bottled water which considers the operation steps inner boundary and also the raw materials and supplies and the outer boundary as the industry l y which involves the middle one and also the water used by employees and office supplies fig 2 it is important to highlight that the volume expressed in liters in the numerator represents in all cases the total volume of freshwater the total wf of each boundary inner middle and outer was calculated by the sum of the direct wf operational which includes the blue and the grey and the indirect wf supply chain as a unique value no distinction between blue and grey the green one was negligible as no raw material from animal or agricultural origin which require rainwater was used in the process additional considerations were established regarding main aspects related to direct and indirect wfs table 1 this work was carried out from cradle to gate which means that the amount of water used for the production of raw materials and supplies were considered but water for the distribution and final disposal of the product was ignored 20 2 3 water balances and water footprint calculation all the water inflows and outflows were identified to perform the mass balance and then the wf calculation fig 1 a fraction of the tap water entering to the process becomes the final product bottled water while the rest which is used for washing purposes within the process area becomes the effluent polluted water percentages of water lost during circulation were defined and calculated for each step 1 of the main flow as well as potential leaks that may have occurred in any equipment operation 0 5 for pumps and 3 for washing and filling machines regarding in both cases the main flow additional amounts of water for washing sand filters and activated carbon columns were also considered according to the operation manual filters should be washed for 90 s with 1 3 l s of water once the production is finished 21 also at least 10 l of water for washing the 20 l bottles before filling are used then three total wfs one for each boundary defined were calculated considering the direct blue and grey and indirect contributions as 1 wf total k wf blue k wf grey k wf indirect k where k represents each boundary inner in l d middle in l l of bottled water or outer in l y depending on the case the blue wf of the inner boundary wf blue inner in l d was calculated as the sum of the individual blue wfs of each process step i considering the volumetric inflow v in and outflow v out of water of each step 2 wf blue inner i 1 s v in i v out i where s is the number of steps in the process fig 1 for the middle boundary the blue wf wf blue middle l l of bottled water was obtained by 3 wf blue middle wf blue inner p b where p bottled water d is the daily production of the plant and b l bottle the bottle capacity the blue wf of the outer boundary wf blue outer l y was determined as 4 wf blue outer wf blue inner d wf blue empl considering the annual working days d d y and the wf of the water used by employees wf blue empl in l y which was estimated taking into account the daily flow rates of water used in showers v shower l d sinks v sink l d and toilets v toilet l d as follows 5 wf blue empl v sink v toilet v shower d the grey wf of the inner boundary wf grey inner in l d eq 6 was calculated as the sum of both grey components from the two steps where a significant pollutant load was considered the effluents from washing filters and from washing bottles step the major contaminant parameters chosen were the biological oxygen demand bod in the first case and detergent concentration in the second 6 wf grey inner i 1 s v out i c out i v in i c in i c max i c nat i where c in and c out in mg l are the specific contaminant concentrations in the inflow and outflow respectively of each step analyzed the maximum permissible concentration of the pollutant in the receiving waterbody is c max in mg l and c nat in mg l is the natural concentration of the contaminant that should be in a waterbody with no environmental impact c nat 0 mg l for both steps municipal legislation establishes 200 mg l for bod and 5 mg l for detergent as the maximum concentration values in the effluent discharged to a receiving water body 22 the remaining steps did not produce effluents that should be diluted before disposal therefore their contribution to grey wf was zero the grey wf for the middle boundary wf grey middle in l l of bottled water was determined by 7 wf grey middle wf grey inner p b and that for the outer boundary wf grey outer in l y by 8 wf grey outer wf grey inner d three specific indirect wfs contributed to the total indirect wf within the inner boundary the wfs considering the equipment wf eq in l d eq 9 and pipes manufacturing wf pps in l d eq 10 and that regarding the electricity needed for equipment operation wf elec in l d eq 11 the sum of the energy consumption of all the equipment was calculated and multiplied by the wf of the electrical energy obtained from the literature table 2 to determine the total one wf elec since equipment pipes and certain office supplies computers printers furniture are used for their lifetime eql their wfs were divided by those values 50 years for stainless steel equipment and pipes 40 years for office wooden furniture and 10 years for office equipment such as computers and printers 9 wf eq i 1 eq wf eq i n eq i eql i where eq is the number of types of different equipment wf eq is the wf for each type of equipment calculated using the wf values of the relevant materials table 2 and n eq is the amount of each type of equipment for pipes manufacturing 10 wf pps x pps wf steel ppsl where x pps indicates the pipes length in m wf steel is the wf of steel obtained from literature table 2 and ppsl is the pipes lifetime for the electricity needed to operate equipment 11 wf elec wf ener i 1 eq pw eq i t i where wf ener is the wf of the electrical energy table 2 pw eq is the power requirement of the equipment in kw and t i is the daily working time of the equipment h d thus for the inner boundary the indirect wf wf indirect inner in l d was calculated as 12 wf indirect inner wf eq wf pps wf elec the indirect wf of the middle boundary wf indirect middle in l l of bottled water was determined as 13 wf indirect middle wf rm wf indirect inner p b where wf rm in l l of bottled water is the indirect wf due to the consumption of raw materials and was calculated as 14 wf rm i 1 rm wf raw i n raw i with rm the number of raw materials used wf raw the wf value of each raw material obtained from literature table 2 and n raw represents the amount consumed of each raw material finally indirect wf of the outer boundary wf indirect outer in l y was calculated as 15 wf indirect outer wf indirect middle p b d wf indirect office wf indirect energy where wf indirect office in l y is the indirect wf due to office supplies furniture paper computers printers determined as 16 wf indirect office i 1 os n os i wf os i osl i n pap wf pap and wf indirect energy is related to the consumption of electrical energy by computers printers and illumination os is the number of different office supplies furniture computers printers wf os is the wf value obtained from literature table 2 n os is the amount of each supply used and osl is its lifetime in the same way the wf due to paper consumption was calculated considering the amount used n pap and the wf obtained from literature wf pap table 2 2 4 definition and analysis of hypothetical scenarios five hypothetical scenarios s s2 s3 s4 s5 s6 were defined and compared to the base case scenario 1 s1 which refers to the wfs obtained from current data of the bottled water model plant this was done to visualize changes positive or negative for the calculated wfs blue grey indirect and total wf in each of the three boundaries inner middle outer when some relevant factors variables drastically change the purpose of this analysis is to recognize significant changes on a particular sector boundary regarding calculated wfs where actions can be applied towards an efficient use of water without neglecting the goals of the plant scenario 2 s2 was defined by assuming that the business could eventually reduce by half electrical energy consumption scenario 3 s3 considered the use of groundwater own well instead of tap water as raw material in this case the energy usage by a submersible pump was added to the indirect wf the fourth scenario s4 was defined by considering the consumption of disposable bottles instead of returnable ones for the fifth scenario s5 transportation of the product to the consumers located in a 7 km radius from the plant was incorporated to the outer boundary finally scenario 6 s6 was defined by assuming that the business could operate at maximum capacity considering 50 more production and employees for all the cases proposed the wfs blue grey indirect and total of the three boundaries were calculated following the same method used in the base case s1 3 results the total blue grey and indirect wf for the three boundaries proposed were calculated by using a standard bottled water plant as model table 1 to facilitate the comparison of the three boundaries all their wfs were expressed in the same units l l of bottled water table 3 for that wfs of the outer boundary were affected by the annual production l of bottled water y instead for the wfs of the inner one the daily production l of bottled water d was used it was observed that the outer and middle wfs were 86 and 64 higher than the inner one respectively table 3 considering that the model plant needs approximately 1 5 l of water to produce 1 l of bottled water in wf terms which also included the grey and indirect contributions the whole business would be really using 600 more water than the amount consumed in the plant blue wf therefore the amount of water that the plant would be using to produce 1 l of bottled water is 6 times higher than initially assumed 3 1 direct and indirect components of the water footprint in the three boundaries evaluated the indirect wf contribution was the one which weighted the most 64 78 over the total fig 3 consumption of electricity played an important role in the indirect wf of the inner boundary 97 mostly due to washing and filling machines and to the use of pumps in the middle and outer boundaries electrical energy and tap water consumption indirect wfs were the factors that most influenced the total wf fig 3 the blue component was highest in the inner boundary fig 3 due to the consumption of water during bottle filling in the packaging operation fig 4 in this boundary even though the grey wf contribution was the lowest 15 fig 3 over the total it was the highest of the three boundaries quite a large amount of water is necessary to dilute the detergent concentration used in the washing step fig 4 below the limit value established by legislation 22 before its final disposal fig 3 the contribution of the indirect wf in the middle boundary was 14 higher than in the inner one fig 3 mostly due to the use of raw materials fig 4 consequently the blue and the grey wfs were lower than for the inner boundary the blue wf of the outer boundary was slightly higher than the middle one fig 3 mainly due to the water consumed by employees fig 4 3 2 assessment of water use in different hypothetical scenarios a scenario analysis was carried out to visualize the critical variables that influenced positively or negatively the total wf hence five hypothetical scenarios were proposed and compared to the base case scenario s1 fig 5 for the inner boundary a lower electrical energy consumption as proposed in s2 fig 5 reduced the total wf by 30 approximately fig 5 which resulted in the decrease of the indirect wf the washing step disappeared when using disposable bottles instead of returnable ones s4 fig 5 and consequently its associated grey wf furthermore the maximum wf value in the inner boundary was achieved in s6 when the production increased as a consequence the daily consumption of tap water and electrical energy also increased causing a rise of approximately 49 over the total wf fig 5 in the middle boundary both s2 and s3 caused a 19 and 38 reduction respectively with respect to the total wf of the base case s1 fig 5 the use of groundwater instead of tap water as raw material s3 totally removed the indirect contribution related to the tap water production reducing the total wf fig 5 in addition in that boundary unlike the inner one s6 the increase of bottled water production caused a decrease in the total wf s4 bottle replacement was the only scenario where the total wf increased in the middle boundary even though the grey component decreased this was due to the consumption of disposable bottles which increased the indirect component considerably and thus the total wf fig 5 reducing by half the electrical energy consumption s2 decreased wfs values in all three boundaries analyzed fig 5 groundwater as raw material s3 caused the lowest wf in both middle and outer boundaries showing 38 and 33 decreases respectively the use of disposable bottles rather than returnable ones s4 increased the total wf approximately 30 in the middle and outer boundaries but caused a 39 decrease in the inner one fig 5 in all boundaries the total wf did not change when the transport of product to the consumers was considered s5 however when the production and number of employees was increased by half s6 unlike the middle boundary the total wf of the inner and outer boundaries was also increased 49 and 41 respectively 4 discussion the water footprint is an indicator that has been implemented around the world to assess the use of water in several products and processes the indirect component is usually the one with the greatest contribution to the total wf in many elaborated products as was observed in this work because it considers the supply chain 28 10 29 30 the wfs for eight different bottled water industries 16 have been reported as 16 to 19 l l of bottled water product which is twice the value than that obtained here 9 l l of bottled water fig 4 the difference may be due to the use of disposable bottles instead of returnable ones 16 which considerably increase the indirect wf 34 increase 12 l l of bottled water fig 5 while the use of returnable bottles involves water for their washing and sanitation it turns out to be a better option when analyzing the efficiency through the wf indicator other researchers determined that the wfs of bottled water plants located in italy ranged between 2 20 and 2 66 l l of bottled water 15 and compared them with the wf of the public tap water 4 42 l l of tap water the differences between both values were mainly associated with large pipeline leaks that occurred in the distribution system the authors also determined the consumption of cooling water to avoid thermal pollution in the manufacture of plastics and corrugated cardboards used in the bottled water business the inclusion of this factor caused a wf value that resulted approximately double 4 61 l l of bottled water of the original one mainly due to the grey component within the indirect one the methodology followed for the wf calculation in those two studies 15 16 was based on a life cycle assessment lca where the contribution of the different colors could not be distinguished in addition those studies did not establish boundaries for the wf calculation so only the wf of the product or middle boundary as considered here was taken into account ignoring the wfs of the industry and the process outer and inner boundaries respectively thus important information regarding water use in critical parts of the plant was totally ignored leading to biased conclusions hoekstra and collaborators 8 stated that before calculating the wf it is important to accurately define the scope of the work which is also requested by the life cycle assessment approach when calculating the wf of a product even though in this work the methodology proposed by hoekstra et al 8 was applied for wf calculation the boundaries approach used here allowed the analysis from a different perspective representing the wf of each boundary in different units rather than in a single one could be useful for business that need to visualize in a concrete way how much water they are using in a day a week a month or a year towards a realistic reduction of the resource s use moreover if any factor that greatly affects the wf of the inner in l d decreases the variations regarding water use will be seen in a short time a day while if this change occurs in the outer boundary in l y modifications will be seen in the long term a year also if water cost is considered they will be able to see how much money they are saving the wf value does not only takes into account the water actually consumed in the same period of time incorporating these dimensions time and currency allows one to enrich the analysis for a certain business according to its seasonal or temporary needs for example this might help managers to reach a better understanding of their water related problems and make better decisions regarding water use when conducting a survey of other beverage industries such as wineries breweries and sugary drinks that have calculated the water footprint higher values were reported than for bottled water due to a greater contribution of the green wf 10 13 unlike bottled water these processes usually involve raw materials of agricultural origin thus the wf of wine product reached a value of 770 l l of bottled wine with a 78 contribution from the green 21 from the grey and only 1 from the blue fraction the greatest contribution to the wf was the green component which was water involved in the cultivation and harvest of grapes 11 in the case of carbonated sugary bottled beverages sugary bottled beverages wf values were also considerably higher than bottled water ranging from 336 to 618 l l for sugary bottled beverages 12 the greatest contribution was attributed to the green wf which was influenced by water use in sugar production mostly cane sugar and or beet sugar 12 summarizing the wf calculation through different components blue grey green and indirect showed if the impact was due to inefficient water consumption blue or incorrect effluent disposal grey both related to the direct contribution or due to the use of resources that have an indirect wf associated this knowledge would be useful for companies to reduce their direct or indirect wf by modifying operational aspects and thus to achieve production in an efficient way to visualize the changes positive or negative regarding water use from the wf point of view we proposed five hypothetical scenarios and compared them to a base case s1 the base case referred to the wf calculation of the current water use by the bottled water model plant in s1 the electrical energy is obtained from conventional methods which can lead to high and inefficient use of the service non conventional technologies such as solar are quite used by some business the main raw material water came from the public network distribution tap water which has already been treated to make it drinkable when a well for water supply could be a suitable alternative especially if the water quality is good enough and no additional treatment or minor treatment is needed in addition returnable bottles were used which required sanitation when returning to the plant a replacement with disposable containers would prevent this procedure finally the product was locally commercialized and distributed but with an opportunity of production increase this would involve more employees and the increase on fuel consumption due to the distribution of the product to consumers that are further away a 50 decrease in electricity consumption as proposed in s2 was the factor which could most reduce the total wf of all boundaries fig 5 this must be considered as a wake up call for companies to become aware that wf can be minimized not only by focusing on the direct consumption of water but also on virtual consumptions that oftentimes are overlooked 8 the indirect wf can be reduced by thinking about efficient electrical energy usage decreasing the electricity consumption could be feasible if a combination of actions like training workers on correct equipment operation and at the same time acquiring non conventional technologies solar energy wind geothermal to partially replace the conventional one are implemented for the business solar panels combined with conventional electricity an example of a hybrid system could be an interesting option especially if there are economic incentives from regulatory agencies or the government these reductions although maybe not yet to the extent of 50 are already taking place despite that the indirect wf related to non conventional energy processes should be an important point to think about another hot spot within the indirect component was the use of disposable bottles instead of returnable ones fig 5 although the total wf of the inner boundary process significantly decreased when the bottle washing step disappeared grey wf almost insignificant the use of disposable bottles increased the total wf of the middle product and outer industry boundaries disposable bottles also contributed to additional environmental problems associated with the accumulation of plastic waste 31 on the other hand use of returnable containers caused a large grey wf due to the bottle washing step fig 4 since this wf was associated with the environmental impact generated by the plant it could be diminished by making more efficient use of detergent and improving the washing machine technology 32 also if the effluent generated during the bottle washing step was properly treated water could be reused for other purposes flushing toilets irrigation of green areas cleaning of facilities among others achieving a more efficient use within the company 32 there is a current tendency in certain sectors towards the analysis and application of circular strategies to reach sustainable production mainly treatments reuse and recycle 33 35 the replacement of tap water with groundwater as raw material decreased the total wf of the middle product and outer industry boundaries but without any variation in the inner boundary as seen in s3 fig 5 this is because the source of the water for raw material did not influence the quantity consumed during the process inner boundary the availability of a well for water supply would be a suitable alternative for the plant as it would eliminate the wf contribution related to the tap water purification process 2 42 l l of tap water 14 this will be true as long as groundwater does not need any additional treatment to reach adequate quality conditions however if any treatment is needed the wf value related to this purification process would not justify the replacement with groundwater another option could be to adopt a groundwater treatment technology with a lower wf contribution instead of the tap water treatment if the product is locally commercialized the main consumers were located close to the plant the fuel consumption involved in transportation did not affect either the total or the indirect wf fig 5 the situation would be different if the company decides to increase its production as they will increment their distribution trips to different locations and states in this circumstance more fuel would be required due to the greater number of trips and longer distances traveled 36 this additional fuel consumption would result in an increase of the total wf equal to 1 06 l kg of fuel consumed 27 it is quite common that industries operate under their real installed production capacity as there are periods where the production increases with the demand this situation may occur in summer for a wide variety of bottled beverage manufacturing plants in this situation the middle boundary was the only one which caused a decrease in total wf fig 5 the total wf of the middle boundary was determined by eq 1 which was obtained from the sum of eq 3 wf blue middle eq 7 wf grey middle and eq 13 wf indirect middle the denominator of these three equations included the production while the numerator represented the respective wfs of the inner boundary blue grey and indirect even though the wfs of the inner boundary process increased as the production increased the result of the ratio showed a decrease of the total wf of the middle boundary this is occurring here because the magnitude of the increase in the production was slightly greater than the one observed in the wfs for the inner boundary eqs 3 7 and 13 hypothetical scenarios showed that the variation of the wfs in each boundary turned out to be different despite the fact that the same changes are occurring this approach allows one to realize which specific sector of the plant decision makers should focus on to apply modifications towards the decrease of the wf without affecting the main goals of the business increase production and profitability finally it is important to remark that although this study was done for a bottled water plant which was used as model the perspective and calculations carried out can be useful for other beverage and also other types of industries which intend to obtain their own wf it is well known that any process product or industry even if it is making the same product has its unique characteristics which can differ from the ones presented here for this reason it will be relevant for other researchers and most importantly for business managers to apply this approach for their own specific wf calculation certainly other considerations may appear product transport facilities construction employees water use etc but this will not involve major complications as long as each boundary process l d product l unit of product and industry l y is well established 5 conclusions in water footprint wf terms the bottled water model plant uses approximately 600 more water than the amount that is directly consumed making the process inefficient regarding water use the indirect component of the wf had the greatest influence on the total wf for the three boundaries the main responsible factors were electricity consumption and the use of raw materials middle and outer boundaries the blue wf was the most significant in the inner boundary process while the grey wf was only substantial in the bottle washing step the water footprint analysis through boundaries is an interesting tool for the companies to better identify critical sectors where improvements could be implemented regarding water use of the five scenarios evaluated the only one that achieved a total wf decrease in the three boundaries was when the energy consumption was reduced by 50 besides that the use of disposable containers instead of returnable bottles diminished the total wf of the inner boundary while in the middle and the outer ones the total wf decreased when replacing tap water with groundwater without producing any variation in the inner boundary the analysis through scenarios allows us to identify significant aspects for directing actions to achieve a more efficient use of the resource without neglecting the specific goals of the business this research showed us that changes regarding wf values among established boundaries will have direct impact on decision making depending on the priorities set by the stakeholders if the plant wants to increase productivity while minimizing water use it will put efforts into reducing the wf of the middle boundary but if the goal is to reach environmental and social commitment wf of the outer boundary should be decreased as reflected in the reduction of electricity consumption or in the replacement of tap water with groundwater we are aware that this work has some key details that will require more attention in the future each business is unique and needs preliminary analysis of its own data before implementing the wf concept as proposed here moreover wf could change among seasons which is relevant in the beverage industry as consumption and production are usually higher in summer for a wide variety of bottled beverages finally beyond the scenario analysis costs involved cannot be ignored since they are a critical component for business to decide if particular actions are feasible to be implemented still we envision that this work could be a motivation to other industries to apply the wf indicator through boundaries to get a more realistic assessment of the water problem within the sector and

13334,in this work the total water involved in a bottled water model plant was estimated total water footprint wf including blue grey and indirect components were calculated for three setting boundaries inner process middle product and outer industry total wf was obtained as the sum of the direct operational and the indirect supply chain wf then five hypothetical scenarios with regard to the base case were examined to find alternatives for wf reduction in wf terms total water use involved in the entire plant was 600 higher than the amount directly consumed blue the indirect wf component contributed the most to the total in all boundaries 64 78 due to energy consumption and raw materials blue and grey components were the highest in the inner due to bottles filling and detergent use hypothetical scenarios showed us that wf values can change among established boundaries which would directly impact on decision making based upon the priorities set by the stakeholders for example if business wants to increase production while minimizing water use it should aim to reduce the wf of the middle boundary conversely if the goal is to reach an environmental and social commitment the plant should consider reducing the wf of the outer boundary to reduce the electrical energy usage or to replace tap with groundwater defining boundaries for wf calculation is a smart tool to distinguish critical sectors so that business could decide where and how to apply or not actions towards more efficient production graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords bottled water plant boundaries water footprint scenarios analysis 1 introduction it has been predicted that water scarcity and pollution will become greater problems in the future due to the increase of water demand and the decrease in its quality 1 in 2050 this scarcity will affect two thirds of the world s population due to excessive water use mainly for food production 2 seventy percent of water in the world is used in agriculture 22 in industry and 8 in households 3 even though the amount of water required for the industrial sector is lower than for agriculture the former will soon compete for this limited resource in a world with an accelerated urban growth and rising food demand 1 4 furthermore water use for effluent treatment and for final disposal of these effluents in natural water bodies is becoming the main source responsible for pollution of large volumes of water 5 6 those industries without policies for sustainable water management will probably no longer remain in the market due to regulatory and social pressures to collaborate with rational and sustainable decision making regarding water use virtual water and water footprint wf concepts appeared in the water market virtual water represents the volume of water required for agricultural or industrial product manufacture 7 while the wf is a multidimensional indicator that considers the origin the source and the time when water is used before being returned to its source or elsewhere it allows one to measure the volume of freshwater directly or indirectly used by a system such as a process a product a geographic region or a business 8 the use of the wf allows one to verify the impact of human activities on aquatic resources to have a better understanding of scarcity and pollution problems 4 this indicator is a valuable tool for business as it will allow to know the real quantity of water consumed which is crucial when trying to produce goods in a more efficient and or eco friendly way this will not only have a direct impact on water saving and environmental sustainability but also on reducing costs food and beverage industries are responsible for the world s largest water consumption footprint as most of them use raw materials of agricultural origin for their processes this sector is the one with the highest wf 9 beverage industries without raw materials of agricultural origin could also have high wfs due to other reasons in fact before calculating the wf boundaries should be established throughout the industry where inputs and outputs are perfectly known 8 hence an industry could be identified as a group of business units that consider all the processes and consumptions involved 8 identification of the opportunities to improve the use of water over the short or long term would be simplified by use of the wf as long as this value is not only expressed per unit of product but also per unit of time several researchers have calculated the wf for different bottled beverage industries such as sugary beer and wine among others 10 13 but have just focused on the wf per unit of product while this is a valuable piece of data sometimes just looking at the results in the same unit for all defined boundaries per unit of product as most cases hinders visualization of how much water is really used in a day week month or year in addition if the cost of water is not considered they will not be able to see how much money they are saving in the same period of time regarding bottled water which could be considered as the simplest of the bottled beverages due to fewer raw materials involved there are only a few published studies carried out for this business 14 16 in all these studies the wf was only calculated per unit of product which is useful for data interpretation but not enough when the goal is to know the use of water in the whole plant bottled water has increased its production around world as people associate it with a healthy lifestyle while distrusting the quality of drinking water produced by conventional processes 17 it is estimated that bottled water consumption per capita reached a global average of approximately 50 l bottled water y in 2017 28 more than in 2012 39 l bottled water y 18 fifteen percent of global bottled water sales occurred in latin america 19 with mexico and brazil the main suppliers these two countries reported an approximate consumption of 254 l bottled water y 1st position in the global bottled water consumption per capita and 105 l bottled water y 15th position per capita respectively in parallel with the increasing bottled water demand and the wide variety of bottled beverages there is also a rising concern due to plastic wastes that are not adequately disposed of around the world causing serious environmental problems the efficient use of water associated with plastics manufacturing and production is another important issue that needs to be considered thinking in wf terms it is quite possible that the total amount of water used in these industries may be higher than expected making it an inefficient process the aims of this study were to estimate the total amount of water involved in a bottled water plant selected as model and to identify the most critical points or sectors regarding water use first we set three boundaries the process inner the product middle and the industry outer then the water footprint indicator including the blue grey and indirect was calculated for all of them finally based on these results five hypothetical scenarios were examined to find the most appropriate alternatives for water footprint reduction 2 materials and methods a standard bottled water plant was selected as model and boundaries were set within it after that the use of water was assessed by implementing the wf concept developed by hoekstra and collaborators 8 the annual production of this plant was estimated in 3 15 106 l of bottled water y 15 000 l of bottled water d the plant needs 1 5 l of freshwater to produce 1 l of bottled water considering leaks and water contained in the product then the product is packaged and delivered in returnable bottles of 20 l 2 1 description of industrial process the main raw material of this process is tap water obtained from the public distribution network other supplies such as pet polyethylene terephthalate plastic caps and labels are also needed for the packaging step to ensure the correct application of the wf concept each step of the process was described and analyzed in detail fig 1 the process was divided into five operational steps fig 1 initially tap water is stored in two stainless steel tanks feed tanks then it is pumped through a sand filter an activated carbon column to remove flavors and odors and a softening column to eliminate ions such as ca2 mg2 and fe2 a fraction of the filtered water is used to wash the 20 l plastic containers in the washing step while the rest is subjected to a disinfection process fig 1 two operations ozonation and addition of cu2 ag and zn2 ions are used to ensure the inactivation of microorganisms that may be present disinfected water is finally poured into 20 l plastic containers these containers as they are returnable are washed in two stages before reuse internally with chlorine based detergent and externally with sanitizing agent that contains hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid after that they are rinsed with filtered water using a spray system filled with disinfected water which is the final product capped and labeled in the packaging step fig 1 damaged plastic containers and labels are replaced with the daily replacement rate at 0 004 for bottles and 0 085 for labels once the process is finished all the equipment and pipes are cleaned using compressed air 2 2 definition of boundaries and assumptions for water footprint calculation the wf calculated here included all the volumes of freshwater used by the model plant and was performed according to the water footprint assessment manual 8 unavailable data were obtained from literature table 2 the wf is defined by three main components or colors blue grey and green 8 the blue wf is referred to the consumption of blue water resources either surface or groundwater this concept includes water loss due to evaporation water that does not return to the original basin and is therefore disposed of into a waterbody receptor river sea dam and or water that is incorporated into a product the grey wf is the volume of freshwater required to assimilate the contaminant loads present in the effluent to reach the limit values established by legislation prior to its final disposal 8 the green wf considers the consumption of green water resources rainwater that did not become runoff but was incorporated into agricultural products 8 to analyze in detail the different sectors of the plant and thus reach a better interpretation of the results three boundaries were defined as follows the inner one representing the process in l d which includes all the operation steps described before fig 1 the middle boundary indicating the product l l of bottled water which considers the operation steps inner boundary and also the raw materials and supplies and the outer boundary as the industry l y which involves the middle one and also the water used by employees and office supplies fig 2 it is important to highlight that the volume expressed in liters in the numerator represents in all cases the total volume of freshwater the total wf of each boundary inner middle and outer was calculated by the sum of the direct wf operational which includes the blue and the grey and the indirect wf supply chain as a unique value no distinction between blue and grey the green one was negligible as no raw material from animal or agricultural origin which require rainwater was used in the process additional considerations were established regarding main aspects related to direct and indirect wfs table 1 this work was carried out from cradle to gate which means that the amount of water used for the production of raw materials and supplies were considered but water for the distribution and final disposal of the product was ignored 20 2 3 water balances and water footprint calculation all the water inflows and outflows were identified to perform the mass balance and then the wf calculation fig 1 a fraction of the tap water entering to the process becomes the final product bottled water while the rest which is used for washing purposes within the process area becomes the effluent polluted water percentages of water lost during circulation were defined and calculated for each step 1 of the main flow as well as potential leaks that may have occurred in any equipment operation 0 5 for pumps and 3 for washing and filling machines regarding in both cases the main flow additional amounts of water for washing sand filters and activated carbon columns were also considered according to the operation manual filters should be washed for 90 s with 1 3 l s of water once the production is finished 21 also at least 10 l of water for washing the 20 l bottles before filling are used then three total wfs one for each boundary defined were calculated considering the direct blue and grey and indirect contributions as 1 wf total k wf blue k wf grey k wf indirect k where k represents each boundary inner in l d middle in l l of bottled water or outer in l y depending on the case the blue wf of the inner boundary wf blue inner in l d was calculated as the sum of the individual blue wfs of each process step i considering the volumetric inflow v in and outflow v out of water of each step 2 wf blue inner i 1 s v in i v out i where s is the number of steps in the process fig 1 for the middle boundary the blue wf wf blue middle l l of bottled water was obtained by 3 wf blue middle wf blue inner p b where p bottled water d is the daily production of the plant and b l bottle the bottle capacity the blue wf of the outer boundary wf blue outer l y was determined as 4 wf blue outer wf blue inner d wf blue empl considering the annual working days d d y and the wf of the water used by employees wf blue empl in l y which was estimated taking into account the daily flow rates of water used in showers v shower l d sinks v sink l d and toilets v toilet l d as follows 5 wf blue empl v sink v toilet v shower d the grey wf of the inner boundary wf grey inner in l d eq 6 was calculated as the sum of both grey components from the two steps where a significant pollutant load was considered the effluents from washing filters and from washing bottles step the major contaminant parameters chosen were the biological oxygen demand bod in the first case and detergent concentration in the second 6 wf grey inner i 1 s v out i c out i v in i c in i c max i c nat i where c in and c out in mg l are the specific contaminant concentrations in the inflow and outflow respectively of each step analyzed the maximum permissible concentration of the pollutant in the receiving waterbody is c max in mg l and c nat in mg l is the natural concentration of the contaminant that should be in a waterbody with no environmental impact c nat 0 mg l for both steps municipal legislation establishes 200 mg l for bod and 5 mg l for detergent as the maximum concentration values in the effluent discharged to a receiving water body 22 the remaining steps did not produce effluents that should be diluted before disposal therefore their contribution to grey wf was zero the grey wf for the middle boundary wf grey middle in l l of bottled water was determined by 7 wf grey middle wf grey inner p b and that for the outer boundary wf grey outer in l y by 8 wf grey outer wf grey inner d three specific indirect wfs contributed to the total indirect wf within the inner boundary the wfs considering the equipment wf eq in l d eq 9 and pipes manufacturing wf pps in l d eq 10 and that regarding the electricity needed for equipment operation wf elec in l d eq 11 the sum of the energy consumption of all the equipment was calculated and multiplied by the wf of the electrical energy obtained from the literature table 2 to determine the total one wf elec since equipment pipes and certain office supplies computers printers furniture are used for their lifetime eql their wfs were divided by those values 50 years for stainless steel equipment and pipes 40 years for office wooden furniture and 10 years for office equipment such as computers and printers 9 wf eq i 1 eq wf eq i n eq i eql i where eq is the number of types of different equipment wf eq is the wf for each type of equipment calculated using the wf values of the relevant materials table 2 and n eq is the amount of each type of equipment for pipes manufacturing 10 wf pps x pps wf steel ppsl where x pps indicates the pipes length in m wf steel is the wf of steel obtained from literature table 2 and ppsl is the pipes lifetime for the electricity needed to operate equipment 11 wf elec wf ener i 1 eq pw eq i t i where wf ener is the wf of the electrical energy table 2 pw eq is the power requirement of the equipment in kw and t i is the daily working time of the equipment h d thus for the inner boundary the indirect wf wf indirect inner in l d was calculated as 12 wf indirect inner wf eq wf pps wf elec the indirect wf of the middle boundary wf indirect middle in l l of bottled water was determined as 13 wf indirect middle wf rm wf indirect inner p b where wf rm in l l of bottled water is the indirect wf due to the consumption of raw materials and was calculated as 14 wf rm i 1 rm wf raw i n raw i with rm the number of raw materials used wf raw the wf value of each raw material obtained from literature table 2 and n raw represents the amount consumed of each raw material finally indirect wf of the outer boundary wf indirect outer in l y was calculated as 15 wf indirect outer wf indirect middle p b d wf indirect office wf indirect energy where wf indirect office in l y is the indirect wf due to office supplies furniture paper computers printers determined as 16 wf indirect office i 1 os n os i wf os i osl i n pap wf pap and wf indirect energy is related to the consumption of electrical energy by computers printers and illumination os is the number of different office supplies furniture computers printers wf os is the wf value obtained from literature table 2 n os is the amount of each supply used and osl is its lifetime in the same way the wf due to paper consumption was calculated considering the amount used n pap and the wf obtained from literature wf pap table 2 2 4 definition and analysis of hypothetical scenarios five hypothetical scenarios s s2 s3 s4 s5 s6 were defined and compared to the base case scenario 1 s1 which refers to the wfs obtained from current data of the bottled water model plant this was done to visualize changes positive or negative for the calculated wfs blue grey indirect and total wf in each of the three boundaries inner middle outer when some relevant factors variables drastically change the purpose of this analysis is to recognize significant changes on a particular sector boundary regarding calculated wfs where actions can be applied towards an efficient use of water without neglecting the goals of the plant scenario 2 s2 was defined by assuming that the business could eventually reduce by half electrical energy consumption scenario 3 s3 considered the use of groundwater own well instead of tap water as raw material in this case the energy usage by a submersible pump was added to the indirect wf the fourth scenario s4 was defined by considering the consumption of disposable bottles instead of returnable ones for the fifth scenario s5 transportation of the product to the consumers located in a 7 km radius from the plant was incorporated to the outer boundary finally scenario 6 s6 was defined by assuming that the business could operate at maximum capacity considering 50 more production and employees for all the cases proposed the wfs blue grey indirect and total of the three boundaries were calculated following the same method used in the base case s1 3 results the total blue grey and indirect wf for the three boundaries proposed were calculated by using a standard bottled water plant as model table 1 to facilitate the comparison of the three boundaries all their wfs were expressed in the same units l l of bottled water table 3 for that wfs of the outer boundary were affected by the annual production l of bottled water y instead for the wfs of the inner one the daily production l of bottled water d was used it was observed that the outer and middle wfs were 86 and 64 higher than the inner one respectively table 3 considering that the model plant needs approximately 1 5 l of water to produce 1 l of bottled water in wf terms which also included the grey and indirect contributions the whole business would be really using 600 more water than the amount consumed in the plant blue wf therefore the amount of water that the plant would be using to produce 1 l of bottled water is 6 times higher than initially assumed 3 1 direct and indirect components of the water footprint in the three boundaries evaluated the indirect wf contribution was the one which weighted the most 64 78 over the total fig 3 consumption of electricity played an important role in the indirect wf of the inner boundary 97 mostly due to washing and filling machines and to the use of pumps in the middle and outer boundaries electrical energy and tap water consumption indirect wfs were the factors that most influenced the total wf fig 3 the blue component was highest in the inner boundary fig 3 due to the consumption of water during bottle filling in the packaging operation fig 4 in this boundary even though the grey wf contribution was the lowest 15 fig 3 over the total it was the highest of the three boundaries quite a large amount of water is necessary to dilute the detergent concentration used in the washing step fig 4 below the limit value established by legislation 22 before its final disposal fig 3 the contribution of the indirect wf in the middle boundary was 14 higher than in the inner one fig 3 mostly due to the use of raw materials fig 4 consequently the blue and the grey wfs were lower than for the inner boundary the blue wf of the outer boundary was slightly higher than the middle one fig 3 mainly due to the water consumed by employees fig 4 3 2 assessment of water use in different hypothetical scenarios a scenario analysis was carried out to visualize the critical variables that influenced positively or negatively the total wf hence five hypothetical scenarios were proposed and compared to the base case scenario s1 fig 5 for the inner boundary a lower electrical energy consumption as proposed in s2 fig 5 reduced the total wf by 30 approximately fig 5 which resulted in the decrease of the indirect wf the washing step disappeared when using disposable bottles instead of returnable ones s4 fig 5 and consequently its associated grey wf furthermore the maximum wf value in the inner boundary was achieved in s6 when the production increased as a consequence the daily consumption of tap water and electrical energy also increased causing a rise of approximately 49 over the total wf fig 5 in the middle boundary both s2 and s3 caused a 19 and 38 reduction respectively with respect to the total wf of the base case s1 fig 5 the use of groundwater instead of tap water as raw material s3 totally removed the indirect contribution related to the tap water production reducing the total wf fig 5 in addition in that boundary unlike the inner one s6 the increase of bottled water production caused a decrease in the total wf s4 bottle replacement was the only scenario where the total wf increased in the middle boundary even though the grey component decreased this was due to the consumption of disposable bottles which increased the indirect component considerably and thus the total wf fig 5 reducing by half the electrical energy consumption s2 decreased wfs values in all three boundaries analyzed fig 5 groundwater as raw material s3 caused the lowest wf in both middle and outer boundaries showing 38 and 33 decreases respectively the use of disposable bottles rather than returnable ones s4 increased the total wf approximately 30 in the middle and outer boundaries but caused a 39 decrease in the inner one fig 5 in all boundaries the total wf did not change when the transport of product to the consumers was considered s5 however when the production and number of employees was increased by half s6 unlike the middle boundary the total wf of the inner and outer boundaries was also increased 49 and 41 respectively 4 discussion the water footprint is an indicator that has been implemented around the world to assess the use of water in several products and processes the indirect component is usually the one with the greatest contribution to the total wf in many elaborated products as was observed in this work because it considers the supply chain 28 10 29 30 the wfs for eight different bottled water industries 16 have been reported as 16 to 19 l l of bottled water product which is twice the value than that obtained here 9 l l of bottled water fig 4 the difference may be due to the use of disposable bottles instead of returnable ones 16 which considerably increase the indirect wf 34 increase 12 l l of bottled water fig 5 while the use of returnable bottles involves water for their washing and sanitation it turns out to be a better option when analyzing the efficiency through the wf indicator other researchers determined that the wfs of bottled water plants located in italy ranged between 2 20 and 2 66 l l of bottled water 15 and compared them with the wf of the public tap water 4 42 l l of tap water the differences between both values were mainly associated with large pipeline leaks that occurred in the distribution system the authors also determined the consumption of cooling water to avoid thermal pollution in the manufacture of plastics and corrugated cardboards used in the bottled water business the inclusion of this factor caused a wf value that resulted approximately double 4 61 l l of bottled water of the original one mainly due to the grey component within the indirect one the methodology followed for the wf calculation in those two studies 15 16 was based on a life cycle assessment lca where the contribution of the different colors could not be distinguished in addition those studies did not establish boundaries for the wf calculation so only the wf of the product or middle boundary as considered here was taken into account ignoring the wfs of the industry and the process outer and inner boundaries respectively thus important information regarding water use in critical parts of the plant was totally ignored leading to biased conclusions hoekstra and collaborators 8 stated that before calculating the wf it is important to accurately define the scope of the work which is also requested by the life cycle assessment approach when calculating the wf of a product even though in this work the methodology proposed by hoekstra et al 8 was applied for wf calculation the boundaries approach used here allowed the analysis from a different perspective representing the wf of each boundary in different units rather than in a single one could be useful for business that need to visualize in a concrete way how much water they are using in a day a week a month or a year towards a realistic reduction of the resource s use moreover if any factor that greatly affects the wf of the inner in l d decreases the variations regarding water use will be seen in a short time a day while if this change occurs in the outer boundary in l y modifications will be seen in the long term a year also if water cost is considered they will be able to see how much money they are saving the wf value does not only takes into account the water actually consumed in the same period of time incorporating these dimensions time and currency allows one to enrich the analysis for a certain business according to its seasonal or temporary needs for example this might help managers to reach a better understanding of their water related problems and make better decisions regarding water use when conducting a survey of other beverage industries such as wineries breweries and sugary drinks that have calculated the water footprint higher values were reported than for bottled water due to a greater contribution of the green wf 10 13 unlike bottled water these processes usually involve raw materials of agricultural origin thus the wf of wine product reached a value of 770 l l of bottled wine with a 78 contribution from the green 21 from the grey and only 1 from the blue fraction the greatest contribution to the wf was the green component which was water involved in the cultivation and harvest of grapes 11 in the case of carbonated sugary bottled beverages sugary bottled beverages wf values were also considerably higher than bottled water ranging from 336 to 618 l l for sugary bottled beverages 12 the greatest contribution was attributed to the green wf which was influenced by water use in sugar production mostly cane sugar and or beet sugar 12 summarizing the wf calculation through different components blue grey green and indirect showed if the impact was due to inefficient water consumption blue or incorrect effluent disposal grey both related to the direct contribution or due to the use of resources that have an indirect wf associated this knowledge would be useful for companies to reduce their direct or indirect wf by modifying operational aspects and thus to achieve production in an efficient way to visualize the changes positive or negative regarding water use from the wf point of view we proposed five hypothetical scenarios and compared them to a base case s1 the base case referred to the wf calculation of the current water use by the bottled water model plant in s1 the electrical energy is obtained from conventional methods which can lead to high and inefficient use of the service non conventional technologies such as solar are quite used by some business the main raw material water came from the public network distribution tap water which has already been treated to make it drinkable when a well for water supply could be a suitable alternative especially if the water quality is good enough and no additional treatment or minor treatment is needed in addition returnable bottles were used which required sanitation when returning to the plant a replacement with disposable containers would prevent this procedure finally the product was locally commercialized and distributed but with an opportunity of production increase this would involve more employees and the increase on fuel consumption due to the distribution of the product to consumers that are further away a 50 decrease in electricity consumption as proposed in s2 was the factor which could most reduce the total wf of all boundaries fig 5 this must be considered as a wake up call for companies to become aware that wf can be minimized not only by focusing on the direct consumption of water but also on virtual consumptions that oftentimes are overlooked 8 the indirect wf can be reduced by thinking about efficient electrical energy usage decreasing the electricity consumption could be feasible if a combination of actions like training workers on correct equipment operation and at the same time acquiring non conventional technologies solar energy wind geothermal to partially replace the conventional one are implemented for the business solar panels combined with conventional electricity an example of a hybrid system could be an interesting option especially if there are economic incentives from regulatory agencies or the government these reductions although maybe not yet to the extent of 50 are already taking place despite that the indirect wf related to non conventional energy processes should be an important point to think about another hot spot within the indirect component was the use of disposable bottles instead of returnable ones fig 5 although the total wf of the inner boundary process significantly decreased when the bottle washing step disappeared grey wf almost insignificant the use of disposable bottles increased the total wf of the middle product and outer industry boundaries disposable bottles also contributed to additional environmental problems associated with the accumulation of plastic waste 31 on the other hand use of returnable containers caused a large grey wf due to the bottle washing step fig 4 since this wf was associated with the environmental impact generated by the plant it could be diminished by making more efficient use of detergent and improving the washing machine technology 32 also if the effluent generated during the bottle washing step was properly treated water could be reused for other purposes flushing toilets irrigation of green areas cleaning of facilities among others achieving a more efficient use within the company 32 there is a current tendency in certain sectors towards the analysis and application of circular strategies to reach sustainable production mainly treatments reuse and recycle 33 35 the replacement of tap water with groundwater as raw material decreased the total wf of the middle product and outer industry boundaries but without any variation in the inner boundary as seen in s3 fig 5 this is because the source of the water for raw material did not influence the quantity consumed during the process inner boundary the availability of a well for water supply would be a suitable alternative for the plant as it would eliminate the wf contribution related to the tap water purification process 2 42 l l of tap water 14 this will be true as long as groundwater does not need any additional treatment to reach adequate quality conditions however if any treatment is needed the wf value related to this purification process would not justify the replacement with groundwater another option could be to adopt a groundwater treatment technology with a lower wf contribution instead of the tap water treatment if the product is locally commercialized the main consumers were located close to the plant the fuel consumption involved in transportation did not affect either the total or the indirect wf fig 5 the situation would be different if the company decides to increase its production as they will increment their distribution trips to different locations and states in this circumstance more fuel would be required due to the greater number of trips and longer distances traveled 36 this additional fuel consumption would result in an increase of the total wf equal to 1 06 l kg of fuel consumed 27 it is quite common that industries operate under their real installed production capacity as there are periods where the production increases with the demand this situation may occur in summer for a wide variety of bottled beverage manufacturing plants in this situation the middle boundary was the only one which caused a decrease in total wf fig 5 the total wf of the middle boundary was determined by eq 1 which was obtained from the sum of eq 3 wf blue middle eq 7 wf grey middle and eq 13 wf indirect middle the denominator of these three equations included the production while the numerator represented the respective wfs of the inner boundary blue grey and indirect even though the wfs of the inner boundary process increased as the production increased the result of the ratio showed a decrease of the total wf of the middle boundary this is occurring here because the magnitude of the increase in the production was slightly greater than the one observed in the wfs for the inner boundary eqs 3 7 and 13 hypothetical scenarios showed that the variation of the wfs in each boundary turned out to be different despite the fact that the same changes are occurring this approach allows one to realize which specific sector of the plant decision makers should focus on to apply modifications towards the decrease of the wf without affecting the main goals of the business increase production and profitability finally it is important to remark that although this study was done for a bottled water plant which was used as model the perspective and calculations carried out can be useful for other beverage and also other types of industries which intend to obtain their own wf it is well known that any process product or industry even if it is making the same product has its unique characteristics which can differ from the ones presented here for this reason it will be relevant for other researchers and most importantly for business managers to apply this approach for their own specific wf calculation certainly other considerations may appear product transport facilities construction employees water use etc but this will not involve major complications as long as each boundary process l d product l unit of product and industry l y is well established 5 conclusions in water footprint wf terms the bottled water model plant uses approximately 600 more water than the amount that is directly consumed making the process inefficient regarding water use the indirect component of the wf had the greatest influence on the total wf for the three boundaries the main responsible factors were electricity consumption and the use of raw materials middle and outer boundaries the blue wf was the most significant in the inner boundary process while the grey wf was only substantial in the bottle washing step the water footprint analysis through boundaries is an interesting tool for the companies to better identify critical sectors where improvements could be implemented regarding water use of the five scenarios evaluated the only one that achieved a total wf decrease in the three boundaries was when the energy consumption was reduced by 50 besides that the use of disposable containers instead of returnable bottles diminished the total wf of the inner boundary while in the middle and the outer ones the total wf decreased when replacing tap water with groundwater without producing any variation in the inner boundary the analysis through scenarios allows us to identify significant aspects for directing actions to achieve a more efficient use of the resource without neglecting the specific goals of the business this research showed us that changes regarding wf values among established boundaries will have direct impact on decision making depending on the priorities set by the stakeholders if the plant wants to increase productivity while minimizing water use it will put efforts into reducing the wf of the middle boundary but if the goal is to reach environmental and social commitment wf of the outer boundary should be decreased as reflected in the reduction of electricity consumption or in the replacement of tap water with groundwater we are aware that this work has some key details that will require more attention in the future each business is unique and needs preliminary analysis of its own data before implementing the wf concept as proposed here moreover wf could change among seasons which is relevant in the beverage industry as consumption and production are usually higher in summer for a wide variety of bottled beverages finally beyond the scenario analysis costs involved cannot be ignored since they are a critical component for business to decide if particular actions are feasible to be implemented still we envision that this work could be a motivation to other industries to apply the wf indicator through boundaries to get a more realistic assessment of the water problem within the sector and thus to make smart decisions towards a more efficient production declaration of competing interest o all authors have participated in the conception and design or analysis and interpretation of the
