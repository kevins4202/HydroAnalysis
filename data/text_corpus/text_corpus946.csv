4730,remote sensing plays an irreplaceable role in mapping evapotranspiration et at the regional scale instantaneous et can be derived by multiple et models based on various remotely sensed data at the time of satellite overpass therefore a reliable temporal upscaling method from instantaneous et to daily et is of great importance in this study six widely used upscaling methods for estimating daily et from instantaneous et were compared under different ecosystems and meteorological conditions based on worldwide eddy covariance flux network in total 139 flux sites based on eddy ccovariance systems at the global scale were used and the 9 00 15 00 overpass times of the main growing season may to september in the northern hemisphere and november to march in the southern hemisphere were chosen as the study period five assessment metrics coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae index of agreement d and relative error re were selected to evaluate the accuracy and applicability of the six upscaling methods the results showed that the modified evaporative fraction mef method and the sine method only at specific times performed best for most ecosystems but the optimal instantaneous time was quite different for different ecosystems the mef method worked best at 12 00 for forests and shrublands and attained the smallest mae at 13 00 for grasslands and savannas for wetlands and croplands the mef method performed best at 14 00 more attention should be paid to the selected instantaneous time when using the sine method because of its high sensitivity to time of day the modified coefficient of the mef method which varied with instantaneous time and ecosystem ranging from 1 04 grassland to 1 36 wetland was also examined the comprehensive results of this study could be useful for mapping daily et from instantaneous et keywords evapotranspiration upscaling method ecosystem global scale remote sensing 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a key process in the energy cycle carbon cycle and hydrological cycle jung et al 2010 and its accurate estimation has significant importance to ecosystem and climate studies fisher et al 2017 biederman et al 2017 due to the high heterogeneity of land use type it is difficult to map regional et using conventional experimental methods however remote sensing data with their high temporal spatial and spectral resolution have become a viable data method for estimating et at regional and global scales bastiaanssen et al 1998 mu et al 2011 however et estimation models based on remotely sensed data can only be used to derive an instantaneous et at the time of satellite overpass therefore temporal upscaling algorithms should be established to upscale et from instantaneous to daily scale furthermore the applicability of upscaling methods under different ecosystems and remotely sensed data should be evaluated especially for water resources research van niel et al 2012 currently methods for deriving daily et from instantaneous et have been investigated based on daily stable or regular characteristics in instantaneous et estimation models generally four kinds of theory are widely used in et upscaling the energy or radiation fraction method crop coefficient method canopy resistance method and solar radiation method the evaporative fraction ef method modified evaporative fraction mef method constant le rn method and constant decoupling factor ω method are four representatives of the energy or radiation fraction method experimental observations have shown that ef defined as the ratio of latent heat to available energy is relatively stable throughout the day which is the foundation of the ef method shuttleworth et al 1989 the theory of the constant le rn method which can also be classified as an energy or radiation fraction method is similar to that of the ef method van niel et al 2012 several studies have found that the ef was underestimated in observation experiments shuttleworth et al 1989 sugita and brutsaert 1991 zhang and lemeur 1995 therefore it was concluded that the ef method should be enlarged by a coefficient approximately 1 1 and the modified ef mef method was proposed anderson et al 1997 tang and li 2017a established a framework with simplified derivations of a theoretical model that could also be classified as an improvement of the energy or radiation fraction method allen et al 1998 2007 found that kc the ratio of actual vegetation evapotranspiration to reference evapotranspiration varies in the course of a day and could be used in et upscaling and proposed the kc method todorovic 1999 proposed the modified kc mkc method in which the climatological resistance was improved climatological resistance means the resistance which only relate to climatological factors air temperature humidity and radiation li et al 2009 the kc method and the mkc method are two typical crop coefficient methods in addition farash et al 2004 analyzed the daytime variation of canopy resistance rc so daily et can be estimated from instantaneous et based on rc which is the principle of the rc method the rc ra ratio of surface resistance to aerodynamic resistance method is also a representative canopy resistance method tang and li 2017b the sine method which was investigated by jackson et al 1983 is classified as a representative solar radiation method shortwave radiation of solar can be described by sine curve in the day time which daily et can be calculated from instantaneous et based on the research summary above six methods ef mef kc mkc rc and sine methods among the four kinds of et upscaling theory were selected in this study the energy balance models were widely used in mapping et at regional scale based on remote sensed images in these models such as metric sebal tseb etc et is computed from remote sensed images and weather data using surface energy balance theory the et flux is calculated as a residual of the surface energy budget equation since the remote sensed data only provides the instantaneous information for the satellites overpass time only suitable upscaling method from instantaneous et to daily et should be selected different methods have been used to map daily evapotranspiration based on various models and remote sensing data the sebal model based on modis data and the ef method was applied to map the evapotranspiration of the hetao irrigation district from 2000 to 2012 yang et al 2012 an extended three temperature model based on modis data and the sine method was used to calculate evapotranspiration in the heihe river basin from 2001 to 2009 tian et al 2013 the sine method was also selected for upscaling instantaneous et to daily values based on landsat etm data and the sebs model ma et al 2018 several comparative studies have also been conducted to evaluate the accuracy and applicability of these upscaling methods hoedjes et al 2008 and gentine et al 2007 found that ef had a larger fluctuation in humid regions and that the ef method had the best performance in arid areas furthermore ef was shown to be influenced by available energy which changed slightly during the day in the high available energy region li et al 2008 colaizzi et al 2006 and xu et al 2015 found that the rc method had the best performance for transpiring vegetation whereas the ef method achieved the highest accuracy for bare soil the rc method was also used to map the daily et of crops in australia and attained high agreement with the eddy covariance system liu et al 2012 chávez et al 2008 compared and discussed the ability of six upscaling methods in cropland in america and found that the kc method performed better under conditions of homogeneous vegetation cover cammalleri et al 2014 analyzed the performance of four upscaling methods using eddy covariance data in america and the results indicated that the sine method had the highest accuracy during long term analysis another comparison study based on four upscaling methods and eddy covariance measurements was also performed in northern china tang et al 2013 and the kc method was suggested as the best method for both clear sky and partly cloudy days some similar studies comparing different methods to estimate daily et from instantaneous et have been published recently and the key results are presented in table 1 according to these previous studies the accuracy and applicability of different upscaling methods are affected by several factors i e ecosystem location upscaling instantaneous time meteorological data and the modified coefficient of the mef method furthermore the ideal upscaling instantaneous time and method for different ecosystems at the global scale remains unclear and few research focused on the modified coefficient of mef method moreover instantaneous et has been obtained based on multiple remotely sensed data i e modis landsat etm sentinel hj 1a 1b spot and others and further study on the ideal upscaling method at the instantaneous time of different satellite overpasses is also needed therefore the purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and applicability of different upscaling methods under different ecosystems and meteorological conditions 139 eddy covariance flux observation sites were collected to evaluate the performance of the six et upscaling methods under different upscaling instantaneous times different ecosystems and different meteorological conditions modified coefficient of mef method was also discussed moreover according to the times of multiple satellite overpasses an optimal et upscaling method for different remotely sensed data was selected this study provides a reference for et upscaling research and the application of remote sensing et models which are crucial in mapping daily et at regional or global scales 2 material and methods 2 1 study sites a total of 139 flux sites within the global flux network https ameriflux lbl gov https fluxnet fluxdata org was used in this study to evaluate the accuracy and applicability of six et upscaling models fig 1 distribution of the 139 flux sites cover most continents in the world with six typical ecosystems including forest 61 sites grassland 28 sites savanna 11 sites wet 8 sites shrubland 13 sites and cropland 18 sites summary descriptions of fluxsites are provided in table a1 energy components net radiation soil heat flux latent heat flux and sensible heat flux and meteorological data air temperature vapor pressure deficit atmospheric pressure and wind speed of non precipitation days at the flux sites were selected in this study for meteorological products the main processing applied to the meteorological data was gap filling by era interim vuichard and paple 2015 turbulent energy fluxes h and le respectively were gap filled using the marginal distribution sampling mds method reichstein et al 2005 fluxes were corrected by multiplying the original gap filled le and h data by an energy balance closure correction factor ebc cf foken 2008 half hourly data were the basis of daily resolution coarser aggregations generated uniformly from half hourly data within the data processing pipeline half hourly resolution and daily resolution data were selected in this study half hourly resolution data were selected as the input instantaneous data and daily resolution data were selected as input daily data and evaluation the main growth periods of vegetation e g from may to september in the northern hemisphere and november to march in the southern hemisphere were chosen as study the periods all of these half hourly data were calculated in hourly intervals e g the averaged values of le at 12 00 and 12 30 were regarded as the instantaneous value at 12 00 seven different possible satellite overpass times from 9 00 to 15 00 were considered to estimate daily et from instantaneous et 2 2 et upscaling methods 2 2 1 ef method ef is defined as the ratio of latent heat to surface available energy and it can be expressed as follows brutsaert and sugita 1992 shuttleworth et al 1989 1 e f i λ e t i r n g i 2 λ e t d e f i r n g d where subscript i is the

instantaneous time i and the daily scale respectively w m 2 2 2 5 rc method the rc method can be expressed as follows malek et al 1992 15 r ci r ai δ i r n g i ρ ai c p v p d i r ai λ e t i δ i 1 r i

the average variation of the six et upscaling methods for all flux sites based on the five assessment indices the results of the coefficient of determination r 2 fig 2a illustrated that all of the et upscaling methods exhibited similar performance with values ranging from 0 7 to 0 9 the r 2 of the forenoon period was lower than the r 2 of the afternoon period the results of the root mean squared

rmse and mae than the mef method performed best at only 12 00 the other four upscaling methods showed similar performance according to the the rmse and mae results according to the index of agreement d fig 2d the mef method had the hightest value from 9 00 to 15 00 the second best upscaling method according to d was the ef method the results of d also showed that the sine method performed best at only 12 00 with a d value between those of the mef method and ef method the other three methods kc mkc and rc methods showed similar variations during the study period where the value of d ranged from 0 6 to 0 7 in summary among the six upscaling methods the mef method showed the highest precision and the strongest robustness during the study period the sine method showed great changes from 9 00 to 15 00 and performed best at only 12 00 the other four methods exhibited similar performance with moderate precision and robustness during the study period from the results of the mean relative error

ranging from 10 to 1 the mean re of the ef method ranged from 16 to 8 showing a trend similar to that of the mef method the mean re of the other three methods kc mkc and rc method had similar value and trend furthermore the results of the mean re of the sine method ranging from 46 to 4 showed the weakest robustness among all methods in summary mef method and ef method performed best during the day time and sine method gained the weakest robustness other three methods had similar performance with moderate accuracy a statistical analysis of six et upscaling methods at various times based on five assessment indices is shown in table 3 the mae which is a more natural measure of average error is taken as an example willmott and matsuura 2005 the mean mae ranged from 21 06 w m2 mef method to 37 83 w m2 sine method at the local time of 9 00 at the same time the mef method and the sine method also attained the smallest and the largest standard deviation sd with values of 11 72 w m2 and 21 24 w m2 respectively at 10 00 the smallest and largest mae values occurred for the mef method 17 80 w m2 and the sine method 28 60 w m2 the highest dispersion degree also occurred for the sine method with an sd value of 16 31 w m2 when the time of 11 00 was selected as the instantaneous time for et upscaling the mef method performed best with the smallest mae 15 89 w m2 and sd 9 96 w m2 and the sine method achieved the highest mae 20 88 w m2 and highest sd 11 76 w m2 at 12 00 the mae of the six methods ranged from 15 08 w m2 mef method to 20 00 w m2 rc method and the sd ranged from 7 56 w m2 sine method to 11 39 w m2 kc method the results at 13 00 and 14 00 indicated that the mef method performed best and that the sine method performed worst at 15 00 which was close to the time of sunset the mef method attained the smallest mae and the highest mae occurred for the sine method during the daytime from 9 00 to 15 00 the mef method performed best with small mae and strong robustness and the sine method performed better at noon and worse near sunrise and sunset with high volatility the ef method had the second best performance at the times of 10 00 11 00 13 00 and 14 00 furthermore the rc method had the second worst performance during the daytime of the study the kc and mkc methods achieved similar performances with moderate precision and dispersion from 9 00 to 15 00 comparisons of measured daily le from eddy covariance data and estimated daily le derived from the six upscaling methods based on instantaneous le are presented in fig a1 the results of the comparison between the measured le and the estimated le based on the ef method showed obvious underestimation from 9 00 to 13 00 obvious underestimation during the study period also occurred with the kc mkc and rc methods based on the sine method underestimation was found from 9 00 to 11 00 and overestimation was found at 13 00 and 14 00 the estimated le based on the mef method agreed well with the measured le during the study period among the six upscaling methods the worst performance occurred at 15 00 with the sine method 3 2 performance of the six methods under various ecosystems fig 3 show a bar chart of the six et upscaling methods for various ecosystems based on the assessment index of mae detailed statistical results was provided in table a2 for forest ecosystems the ef mef and sine methods performed best at the instantaneous time of 12 00 with mae ranging from 16 60 w m2to 19 01 w m2 the kc mkc and rc methods were best at 15 00 overall the mef method and the sine method were the recommended methods for the forest ecosystem for grasslands the results of 28 flux sites illustrated that the ef kc mkc and rc methods had the best performance at 15 00 with mae ranging from 13 31 w m2 to 15 43 w m2 while the mef method and sine method had the best performance at 13 00 and 12 00 with mae of 12 32 w m2 and 13 44 w m2 respectively the recommended methods for grassland were the sine method and the mef method the results of savannas illustrated that the best performance of the six methods occurred from 13 00 to 14 00 the ef method and the kc method had the smallest mae at 14 00 with an mae of 13 90 w m2 and 15 14 w m2 respectively the other four methods performed best at 13 00 with mae ranging from 12 13 w m2 to 15 50 w m2 the sine and mef methods were the recommended methods for the savanna ecosystem the results of the wetland ecosystem indicated that the estimated le based on instantaneous le in the afternoon performed better than that of the instantaneous le in the forenoon the recommended time of the ef method and the mef method was 14 00 with mae of 13 23 w m2 and 14 85 w m2 whereas the kc method mkc method and rc method showed the smallest mae at 15 00 the smallest mae of the sine method occurred at 12 00 with a value of 15 19 w m2 overall the mef and kc methods were recommended for wetland ecosystems the results of shrublands which were slightly different from those of wetlands indicated that the estimated le based on forenoon and noon le worked better than that based on the afternoon le except for the rc method and the sine method the recommended upscaling time for the ef kc and mkc methods was 11 00 for the mef method 12 00 was regarded as the optimal upscaling time the recommended times of the rc method and sine method for shrublands were 15 00 and 13 00 respectively the ideal upscaling methods for shrublands are the mef method and sine method for cropland the results indicated that most methods performed better with high precision based on instantaneous le at 14 00 and 15 00 except for the sine method the ef kc mkc and rc methods had the smallest mae at 15 00 the mef method performed best at 14 00 and the recommended time of the sine method was 12 00 the optimal methods for cropland were the sine method and the mef method although the sine method was regarded as the recommended method for all ecosystems except the wetlands ecosystem the upscaling results of the sine method were not as stable as those of the other five methods the results also indicated that the extended precision was more sensitive to instantaneous time more attention should be paid to the instantaneous time when using the sine method the mef method is an optimal method for all ecosystems with high precision of various instantaneous times 3 3 performance of the six methods under different meteorological conditions net radiation rn temperature ta vapor pressure difference vpd available energy rn g and windspeed ws were regarded as the main influencing factors of evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 the rn ta vpd rn g and ws at daily time scales were selected in this study to analyze the performance of the six upscaling methods under different meteorological conditions table 4 shows the impacts of meteorological data relative to the six et upscaling methods based on the assessment index of the mae according to the results of section 3 1 mae of six et upscaling methods was chosen and mean mae was calculated under specific meteorological conditions e g rn 50 w m2 ta 10 c vpd 1 kpa etc from the results of different rn the mae of all upscaling methods increased with rn and the sine method was the most sensitive method to rn the results of mae under different ta showed that all upscaling methods increased with ta when ta was 30 c the smallest mae occurred at high temperatures ta 30 c as for vpd the mae of all the upscaling methods increased with vpd when vpd was 2 kpa and decreased with vpd when vpd was 2 kpa the smallest mae occurred at high vpd conditions vpd 3 kpa similar to the results of rn the results of mae under different rn g for the six upscaling methods increased with available energy as for ws all upscaling methods achieved the highest accuracy at high wind speeds ws 4 m s overall the mef method performed best under different meteorological conditions t test was also adopted in this study table 5 the results of t test showed significant difference among six upscaling methods under various meteorological conditions 95 confidence interval except few specific meteorological conditions for example significant difference was found between ef method and sine method when net radiation or available energy was 50 w m2 4 discussion 4 1 modified coefficient α of the mef method underestimation has been found in the ef method so the modified coefficient should be used to modify the ef method mef method although the value of 1 1 is selected as the modified coefficient in most study cases the modified coefficient α might vary with instantaneous upscaling time and ecosystem thus an assessment of the performance of different modified coefficients for the various ecosystems in this study was undertaken the modified coefficient was changed from 0 7 to 1 4 with steps of 0 01 and the mae was selected as the assessment index the ideal optimal α was selected according to the smallest mae the results of the six upscaling methods at different instantaneous times showed that the ideal α was quite different for different ecosystems fig 4 and table 6 for forest the optimal αincreased with time from 9 00 to 11 00 and the value of α ranged from 1 16 9 00 to 1 29 11 00 then the optimal αdecreased with time from 12 00 to 15 00 the results of grassland were similar to those of forest the α increased with time from 9 00 to 10 00 and then decreased with time after 10 00 the highest and lowest α occurred at 10 00 and 15 00 with values of 1 25 and 1 04 respectively the optimal α for savanna increased with time in the forenoon and decreased with time in the afternoon and the highest α was 1 17 12 00 for wetlands the optimal α had great variation with the highest α of different ecosystems under different instantaneous times the optimal α of shrubland showed an increasing trend with highest and lowest values of 1 19 13 00 and 15 00 and 1 06 10 00 respectively for cropland the variation of α showed a trend similar to that of wetland the optimal α decreased with time during the study period the highest α of 1 33 occurred at 9 00 and 10 00 and the lowest value of 1 08 occurred at 15 00 overall the optimal αunder the different ecosystems based on different instantaneous le was found to be an unfixed value during the study period 9 00 15 00 underestimation was found in le upscaling so the required αvalue was 1 4 2 ideal upscaling method for multiple remotely sensed data multiple remotely sensed data i e modis landsat etm sentinel hj 1a 1b spot gaofen were used for instantaneous et estimation the overpass time of most of the remotely sensed data was around 10 30 in the forenoon except for aqua modis which overpassed at around 13 30 in the afternoon according to the results from 3 2 to 3 4 the optimal upscaling methods for the different ecosystems for typical satellites are shown in table 7 the mef and ef methods were optimal for all ecosystems except for the shrubland ecosystem and all typical remotely sensed data the kc method was more suitable than the ef method for shrublands although the mef method was the optimal upscaling method the optimal α values were quite different among different ecosystems and different typical satellites the optimal α for various satellites overpassed in the forenoon was the mean value of the optimal α at 10 00 and 11 00 and the optimal α for satellites overpassed in the afternoon was the mean value of the optimal α at 13 00 and 14 00 for the satellites overpassed in the forenoon the optimal α values of the different ecosystems were 1 29 forest 1 21 grassland 1 16 savanna 1 34 wetland 1 12 shrubland and 1 30 cropland for the satellites that overpassed in the afternoon the opitiaml α values of the different ecosystems were 1 16 forest 1 09 grassland 1 14 savanna 1 30 wetland 1 17 shrubland and 1 15 cropland 4 3 comparison with other studies the results of this study showed that underestimation occurred among the six upscaling methods in most situations and the accuracy at noon and in the afternoon was slightly higher than that in the forenoon which was consistent with the results of previous research chávez et al 2008 tang and li 2017b the possible reasons for the underestimation of upscaled daily et may be the presence of cloud and energy conditions delogu et al 2012 jiang et al 2018 tang et al 2017 the evaporative fraction ef was more stable on clear sky days and a larger bias occurred on partly cloudy sky and cloudy sky days in this study only non precipitation days were selected and the impact of cloud was not taken into consideration this may be the reason why more underestimation of daily et occurred in this study than in other clear sky based studies in the study of colaizzi et al 2006 the kc method performed better for cropland which is inconsistent with the findings of this study the possible reason may be that clear day and irrigated cropland were selected in colaizzi s study and the influence of soil moisture and cloud condition was smaller than in the case of the data used in this study as underestimation of daily et from instantaneous et may occur in many cases the discussion of the modified coefficient α is indispensable the results of this study showed that the optimal modified coefficients of wetland and cropland were obviously larger than those of other ecosystems the possible influencing factors might be atmospheric advection and the moisture condition of the underlying and vegetation fractions evapotranspiration from wetland and cropland systems may be enhanced by atmospheric advection moreover wetlands and croplands were under mild water stress or slight water stress with high vegetation fraction during the growth phase where the land surface temperature was less than that of other ecosystems longwave radiation was influenced by land surface temperature thus the longwave radiation of wetlands and croplands might be less than that of other ecosystems and may result in greater underestimation of ef the modified coefficient may be influenced by several factors the discussion of the modified coefficient in this study was only a preliminary evaluation deep research on the modified coefficient should be conducted and a theoretical model of the modified coefficient based on physical bases should be established in further studies tang and li 2017a furthermore the quality of the input data was foundational for the upscaling method comparison and evaluation additional comparisons with different data preparation methods and aggregating methods are necessary in future studies 5 summary and conclusion the objective of this study was to compare six methods for upscaling instantaneous le to daily le to provide reasonable suggestions for et estimation based on remote sensing technology the following conclusions were drawn from the study 1 there were large differences in estimated daily le based on different instantaneous le with the six upscaling methods in general the mef and sine methods only at specific times showed the best agreement with the measured le under the six ecosystems having the smallest mae values of 14 96 w m2 and 16 08 w m2 respectively the results also showed that the time of day had a significant influence on the performance of the six upscaling methods especially the sine method 2 the optimal method and instantaneous time used for le upscaling were quite different when characterized by ecosystem for the forest ecosystem the ef mef and sine methods performed best at 12 00 with mae ranging from 16 60 w m2to 19 01 w m2 and the kc mkc and rc methods performed best at 15 00 with an average mae of 19 91 w m2 the optimal instantaneous time occurred in the afternoon for grassland 13 00 savanna 13 00 wetland 14 00 and cropland 14 00 for shrublands the recommended instantaneous time was quite different among the different methods the ef kc and mkc methods worked best at 11 00 but the ef method achieved the smallest mae of 11 12 w m2 at the instantaneous time of 12 00 overall the mef method and the sine method were applicable for most ecosystems more attention should be paid to the selected instantaneous time when using the sine method as this method is more sensitive to time of day 3 the modified coefficient α used in the mef method was not a fixed value it varied with the time of day and the ecosystem ranging from 1 07 shrubland to 1 36 wetland the modified coefficient α of wetland 1 29 and cropland 1 24 was larger than that of other ecosystems 4 the mef method is the ideal upscaling method for most remotely sensed data however the modified coefficient α varied for different ecosystems more attention should be paid

4730,remote sensing plays an irreplaceable role in mapping evapotranspiration et at the regional scale instantaneous et can be derived by multiple et models based on various remotely sensed data at the time of satellite overpass therefore a reliable temporal upscaling method from instantaneous et to daily et is of great importance in this study six widely used upscaling methods for estimating daily et from instantaneous et were compared under different ecosystems and meteorological conditions based on worldwide eddy covariance flux network in total 139 flux sites based on eddy ccovariance systems at the global scale were used and the 9 00 15 00 overpass times of the main growing season may to september in the northern hemisphere and november to march in the southern hemisphere were chosen as the study period five assessment metrics coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae index of agreement d and relative error re were selected to evaluate the accuracy and applicability of the six upscaling methods the results showed that the modified evaporative fraction mef method and the sine method only at specific times performed best for most ecosystems but the optimal instantaneous time was quite different for different ecosystems the mef method worked best at 12 00 for forests and shrublands and attained the smallest mae at 13 00 for grasslands and savannas for wetlands and croplands the mef method performed best at 14 00 more attention should be paid to the selected instantaneous time when using the sine method because of its high sensitivity to time of day the modified coefficient of the mef method which varied with instantaneous time and ecosystem ranging from 1 04 grassland to 1 36 wetland was also examined the comprehensive results of this study could be useful for mapping daily et from instantaneous et keywords evapotranspiration upscaling method ecosystem global scale remote sensing 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a key process in the energy cycle carbon cycle and hydrological cycle jung et al 2010 and its accurate estimation has significant importance to ecosystem and climate studies fisher et al 2017 biederman et al 2017 due to the high heterogeneity of land use type it is difficult to map regional et using conventional experimental methods however remote sensing data with their high temporal spatial and spectral resolution have become a viable data method for estimating et at regional and global scales bastiaanssen et al 1998 mu et al 2011 however et estimation models based on remotely sensed data can only be used to derive an instantaneous et at the time of satellite overpass therefore temporal upscaling algorithms should be established to upscale et from instantaneous to daily scale furthermore the applicability of upscaling methods under different ecosystems and remotely sensed data should be evaluated especially for water resources research van niel et al 2012 currently methods for deriving daily et from instantaneous et have been investigated based on daily stable or regular characteristics in instantaneous et estimation models generally four kinds of theory are widely used in et upscaling the energy or radiation fraction method crop coefficient method canopy resistance method and solar radiation method the evaporative fraction ef method modified evaporative fraction mef method constant le rn method and constant decoupling factor ω method are four representatives of the energy or radiation fraction method experimental observations have shown that ef defined as the ratio of latent heat to available energy is relatively stable throughout the day which is the foundation of the ef method shuttleworth et al 1989 the theory of the constant le rn method which can also be classified as an energy or radiation fraction method is similar to that of the ef method van niel et al 2012 several studies have found that the ef was underestimated in observation experiments shuttleworth et al 1989 sugita and brutsaert 1991 zhang and lemeur 1995 therefore it was concluded that the ef method should be enlarged by a coefficient approximately 1 1 and the modified ef mef method was proposed anderson et al 1997 tang and li 2017a established a framework with simplified derivations of a theoretical model that could also be classified as an improvement of the energy or radiation fraction method allen et al 1998 2007 found that kc the ratio of actual vegetation evapotranspiration to reference evapotranspiration varies in the course of a day and could be used in et upscaling and proposed the kc method todorovic 1999 proposed the modified kc mkc method in which the climatological resistance was improved climatological resistance means the resistance which only relate to climatological factors air temperature humidity and radiation li et al 2009 the kc method and the mkc method are two typical crop coefficient methods in addition farash et al 2004 analyzed the daytime variation of canopy resistance rc so daily et can be estimated from instantaneous et based on rc which is the principle of the rc method the rc ra ratio of surface resistance to aerodynamic resistance method is also a representative canopy resistance method tang and li 2017b the sine method which was investigated by jackson et al 1983 is classified as a representative solar radiation method shortwave radiation of solar can be described by sine curve in the day time which daily et can be calculated from instantaneous et based on the research summary above six methods ef mef kc mkc rc and sine methods among the four kinds of et upscaling theory were selected in this study the energy balance models were widely used in mapping et at regional scale based on remote sensed images in these models such as metric sebal tseb etc et is computed from remote sensed images and weather data using surface energy balance theory the et flux is calculated as a residual of the surface energy budget equation since the remote sensed data only provides the instantaneous information for the satellites overpass time only suitable upscaling method from instantaneous et to daily et should be selected different methods have been used to map daily evapotranspiration based on various models and remote sensing data the sebal model based on modis data and the ef method was applied to map the evapotranspiration of the hetao irrigation district from 2000 to 2012 yang et al 2012 an extended three temperature model based on modis data and the sine method was used to calculate evapotranspiration in the heihe river basin from 2001 to 2009 tian et al 2013 the sine method was also selected for upscaling instantaneous et to daily values based on landsat etm data and the sebs model ma et al 2018 several comparative studies have also been conducted to evaluate the accuracy and applicability of these upscaling methods hoedjes et al 2008 and gentine et al 2007 found that ef had a larger fluctuation in humid regions and that the ef method had the best performance in arid areas furthermore ef was shown to be influenced by available energy which changed slightly during the day in the high available energy region li et al 2008 colaizzi et al 2006 and xu et al 2015 found that the rc method had the best performance for transpiring vegetation whereas the ef method achieved the highest accuracy for bare soil the rc method was also used to map the daily et of crops in australia and attained high agreement with the eddy covariance system liu et al 2012 chávez et al 2008 compared and discussed the ability of six upscaling methods in cropland in america and found that the kc method performed better under conditions of homogeneous vegetation cover cammalleri et al 2014 analyzed the performance of four upscaling methods using eddy covariance data in america and the results indicated that the sine method had the highest accuracy during long term analysis another comparison study based on four upscaling methods and eddy covariance measurements was also performed in northern china tang et al 2013 and the kc method was suggested as the best method for both clear sky and partly cloudy days some similar studies comparing different methods to estimate daily et from instantaneous et have been published recently and the key results are presented in table 1 according to these previous studies the accuracy and applicability of different upscaling methods are affected by several factors i e ecosystem location upscaling instantaneous time meteorological data and the modified coefficient of the mef method furthermore the ideal upscaling instantaneous time and method for different ecosystems at the global scale remains unclear and few research focused on the modified coefficient of mef method moreover instantaneous et has been obtained based on multiple remotely sensed data i e modis landsat etm sentinel hj 1a 1b spot and others and further study on the ideal upscaling method at the instantaneous time of different satellite overpasses is also needed therefore the purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and applicability of different upscaling methods under different ecosystems and meteorological conditions 139 eddy covariance flux observation sites were collected to evaluate the performance of the six et upscaling methods under different upscaling instantaneous times different ecosystems and different meteorological conditions modified coefficient of mef method was also discussed moreover according to the times of multiple satellite overpasses an optimal et upscaling method for different remotely sensed data was selected this study provides a reference for et upscaling research and the application of remote sensing et models which are crucial in mapping daily et at regional or global scales 2 material and methods 2 1 study sites a total of 139 flux sites within the global flux network https ameriflux lbl gov https fluxnet fluxdata org was used in this study to evaluate the accuracy and applicability of six et upscaling models fig 1 distribution of the 139 flux sites cover most continents in the world with six typical ecosystems including forest 61 sites grassland 28 sites savanna 11 sites wet 8 sites shrubland 13 sites and cropland 18 sites summary descriptions of fluxsites are provided in table a1 energy components net radiation soil heat flux latent heat flux and sensible heat flux and meteorological data air temperature vapor pressure deficit atmospheric pressure and wind speed of non precipitation days at the flux sites were selected in this study for meteorological products the main processing applied to the meteorological data was gap filling by era interim vuichard and paple 2015 turbulent energy fluxes h and le respectively were gap filled using the marginal distribution sampling mds method reichstein et al 2005 fluxes were corrected by multiplying the original gap filled le and h data by an energy balance closure correction factor ebc cf foken 2008 half hourly data were the basis of daily resolution coarser aggregations generated uniformly from half hourly data within the data processing pipeline half hourly resolution and daily resolution data were selected in this study half hourly resolution data were selected as the input instantaneous data and daily resolution data were selected as input daily data and evaluation the main growth periods of vegetation e g from may to september in the northern hemisphere and november to march in the southern hemisphere were chosen as study the periods all of these half hourly data were calculated in hourly intervals e g the averaged values of le at 12 00 and 12 30 were regarded as the instantaneous value at 12 00 seven different possible satellite overpass times from 9 00 to 15 00 were considered to estimate daily et from instantaneous et 2 2 et upscaling methods 2 2 1 ef method ef is defined as the ratio of latent

instantaneous time i and the daily scale respectively w m 2 2 2 5 rc method the rc method can be expressed as follows malek et al 1992 15 r ci r ai δ i r n g i ρ ai c p v p d i r ai λ e t i δ i 1 r i

only 12 00 with a d value between those of the mef method and ef method the other three methods kc mkc and rc methods showed similar variations during the study period where the value of d ranged from 0 6 to 0 7 in summary among the six upscaling methods the mef method showed the highest precision and the strongest robustness during the study period the sine method showed great changes from 9 00 to 15 00 and performed best at only 12 00 the other four methods exhibited similar performance with moderate precision and robustness during the study period from the results of the mean relative error

ranging from 10 to 1 the mean re of the ef method ranged from 16 to 8 showing a trend similar to that of the mef method the mean re of the other three methods kc mkc and rc method had similar value and trend furthermore the results of the mean re of the sine method ranging from 46 to 4 showed the weakest robustness among all methods in summary mef method and ef method performed best during the day time and sine method gained the weakest robustness other three methods had similar performance with moderate accuracy a statistical analysis of six et upscaling methods at various times based on five assessment indices is shown in table 3 the mae which is a more natural measure of average error is taken as an example willmott and matsuura 2005 the mean mae ranged from 21 06 w m2 mef method to 37 83 w m2 sine method at the local time of 9 00 at the same time the mef method and the sine method also attained the smallest and the largest standard deviation sd with values of 11 72 w m2 and 21 24 w m2 respectively at 10 00 the smallest and largest mae values occurred for the mef method 17 80 w m2 and the sine method 28 60 w m2 the highest dispersion degree also occurred for the sine method with an sd value of 16 31 w m2 when the time of 11 00 was selected as the instantaneous time for et upscaling the mef method performed best with the smallest mae 15 89 w m2 and sd 9 96 w m2 and the sine method achieved the highest mae 20 88 w m2 and highest sd 11 76 w m2 at 12 00 the mae of the six methods ranged from 15 08 w m2 mef method to 20 00 w m2 rc method and the sd ranged from 7 56 w m2 sine method to 11 39 w m2 kc method the results at 13 00 and 14 00 indicated that the mef method performed best and that the sine method performed worst at 15 00 which was close to the time of sunset the mef method attained the smallest mae and the highest mae occurred for the sine method during the daytime from 9 00 to 15 00 the mef method performed best with small mae and strong robustness and the sine method performed better at noon and worse near sunrise and sunset with high volatility the ef method had the second best performance at the times of 10 00 11 00 13 00 and 14 00 furthermore the rc method had the second worst performance during the daytime of the study the kc and mkc methods achieved similar performances with moderate precision and dispersion from 9 00 to 15 00 comparisons of measured daily le from eddy covariance data and estimated daily le derived from the six upscaling methods based on instantaneous le are presented in fig a1 the results of the comparison between the measured le and the estimated le based on the ef method showed obvious underestimation from 9 00 to 13 00 obvious underestimation during the study period also occurred with the kc mkc and rc methods based on the sine method underestimation was found from 9 00 to 11 00 and overestimation was found at 13 00 and 14 00 the estimated le based on the mef method agreed well with the measured le during the study period among the six upscaling methods the worst performance occurred at 15 00 with the sine method 3 2 performance of the six methods under various ecosystems fig 3 show a bar chart of the six et upscaling methods for various ecosystems based on the assessment index of mae detailed statistical results was provided in table a2 for forest ecosystems the ef mef and sine methods performed best at the instantaneous time of 12 00 with mae ranging from 16 60 w m2to 19 01 w m2 the kc mkc and rc methods were best at 15 00 overall the mef method and the sine method were the recommended methods for the forest ecosystem for grasslands the results of 28 flux sites illustrated that the ef kc mkc and rc methods had the best performance at 15 00 with mae ranging from 13 31 w m2 to 15 43 w m2 while the mef method and sine method had the best performance at 13 00 and 12 00 with mae of 12 32 w m2 and 13 44 w m2 respectively the recommended methods for grassland were the sine method and the mef method the results of savannas illustrated that the best performance of the six methods occurred from 13 00 to 14 00 the ef method and the kc method had the smallest mae at 14 00 with an mae of 13 90 w m2 and 15 14 w m2 respectively the other four methods performed best at 13 00 with mae ranging from 12 13 w m2 to 15 50 w m2 the sine and mef methods were the recommended methods for the savanna ecosystem the results of the wetland ecosystem indicated that the estimated le based on instantaneous le in the afternoon performed better than that of the instantaneous le in the forenoon the recommended time of the ef method and the mef method was 14 00 with mae of 13 23 w m2 and 14 85 w m2 whereas the kc method mkc method and rc method showed the smallest mae at 15 00 the smallest mae of the sine method occurred at 12 00 with a value of 15 19 w m2 overall the mef and kc methods were recommended for wetland ecosystems the results of shrublands which were slightly different from those of wetlands indicated that the estimated le based on forenoon and noon le worked better than that based on the afternoon le except for the rc method and the sine method the recommended upscaling time for the ef kc and mkc methods was 11 00 for the mef method 12 00 was regarded as the optimal upscaling time the recommended times of the rc method and sine method for shrublands were 15 00 and 13 00 respectively the ideal upscaling methods for shrublands are the mef method and sine method for cropland the results indicated that most methods performed better with high precision based on instantaneous le at 14 00 and 15 00 except for the sine method the ef kc mkc and rc methods had the smallest mae at 15 00 the mef method performed best at 14 00 and the recommended time of the sine method was 12 00 the optimal methods for cropland were the sine method and the mef method although the sine method was regarded as the recommended method for all ecosystems except the wetlands ecosystem the upscaling results of the sine method were not as stable as those of the other five methods the results also indicated that the extended precision was more sensitive to instantaneous time more attention should be paid to the instantaneous time when using the sine method the mef method is an optimal method for all ecosystems with high precision of various instantaneous times 3 3 performance of the six methods under different meteorological conditions net radiation rn temperature ta vapor pressure difference vpd available energy rn g and windspeed ws were regarded as the main influencing factors of evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 the rn ta vpd rn g and ws at daily time scales were selected in this study to analyze the performance of the six upscaling methods under different meteorological conditions table 4 shows the impacts of meteorological data relative to the six et upscaling methods based on the assessment index of the mae according to the results of section 3 1 mae of six et upscaling methods was chosen and mean mae was calculated under specific meteorological conditions e g rn 50 w m2 ta 10 c vpd 1 kpa etc from the results of different rn the mae of all upscaling methods increased with rn and the sine method was the most sensitive method to rn the results of mae under different ta showed that all upscaling methods increased with ta when ta was 30 c the smallest mae occurred at high temperatures ta 30 c as for vpd the mae of all the upscaling methods increased with vpd when vpd was 2 kpa and decreased with vpd when vpd was 2 kpa the smallest mae occurred at high vpd conditions vpd 3 kpa similar to the results of rn the results of mae under different rn g for the six upscaling methods increased with available energy as for ws all upscaling methods achieved the highest accuracy at high wind speeds ws 4 m s overall the mef method performed best under different meteorological conditions t test was also adopted in this study table 5 the results of t test showed significant difference among six upscaling methods under various meteorological conditions 95 confidence interval except few specific meteorological conditions for example significant difference was found between ef method and sine method when net radiation or available energy was 50 w m2 4 discussion 4 1 modified coefficient α of the mef method underestimation has been found in the ef method so the modified coefficient should be used to modify the ef method mef method although the value of 1 1 is selected as the modified coefficient in most study cases the modified coefficient α might vary with instantaneous upscaling time and ecosystem thus an assessment of the performance of different modified coefficients for the various ecosystems in this study was undertaken the modified coefficient was changed from 0 7 to 1 4 with steps of 0 01 and the mae was selected as the assessment index the ideal optimal α was selected according to the smallest mae the results of the six upscaling methods at different instantaneous times showed that the ideal α was quite different for different ecosystems fig 4 and table 6 for forest the optimal αincreased with time from 9 00 to 11 00 and the value of α ranged from 1 16 9 00 to 1 29 11 00 then the optimal αdecreased with time from 12 00 to 15 00 the results of grassland were similar to those of forest the α increased with time from 9 00 to 10 00 and then decreased with time after 10 00 the highest and lowest α occurred at 10 00 and 15 00 with values of 1 25 and 1 04 respectively the optimal α for savanna increased with time in the forenoon and decreased with time in the afternoon and the highest α was 1 17 12 00 for wetlands the optimal α had great variation with the highest α of different ecosystems under different instantaneous times the optimal α of shrubland showed an increasing trend with highest and lowest values of 1 19 13 00 and 15 00 and 1 06 10 00 respectively for cropland the variation of α showed a trend similar to that of wetland the optimal α decreased with time during the study period the highest α of 1 33 occurred at 9 00 and 10 00 and the lowest value of 1 08 occurred at 15 00 overall the optimal αunder the different ecosystems based on different instantaneous le was found to be an unfixed value during the study period 9 00 15 00 underestimation was found in le upscaling so the required αvalue was 1 4 2 ideal upscaling method for multiple remotely sensed data multiple remotely sensed data i e modis landsat etm sentinel hj 1a 1b spot gaofen were used for instantaneous et estimation the overpass time of most of the remotely sensed data was around 10 30 in the forenoon except for aqua modis which overpassed at around 13 30 in the afternoon according to the results from 3 2 to 3 4 the optimal upscaling methods for the different ecosystems for typical satellites are shown in table 7 the mef and ef methods were optimal for all ecosystems except for the shrubland ecosystem and all typical remotely sensed data the kc method was more suitable than the ef method for shrublands although the mef method was the optimal upscaling method the optimal α values were quite different among different ecosystems and different typical satellites the optimal α for various satellites overpassed in the forenoon was the mean value of the optimal α at 10 00 and 11 00 and the optimal α for satellites overpassed in the afternoon was the mean value of the optimal α at 13 00 and 14 00 for the satellites overpassed in the forenoon the optimal α values of the different ecosystems were 1 29 forest 1 21 grassland 1 16 savanna 1 34 wetland 1 12 shrubland and 1 30 cropland for the satellites that overpassed in the afternoon the opitiaml α values of the different ecosystems were 1 16 forest 1 09 grassland 1 14 savanna 1 30 wetland 1 17 shrubland and 1 15 cropland 4 3 comparison with other studies the results of this study showed that underestimation occurred among the six upscaling methods in most situations and the accuracy at noon and in the afternoon was slightly higher than that in the forenoon which was consistent with the results of previous research chávez et al 2008 tang and li 2017b the possible reasons for the underestimation of upscaled daily et may be the presence of cloud and energy conditions delogu et al 2012 jiang et al 2018 tang et al 2017 the evaporative fraction ef was more stable on clear sky days and a larger bias occurred on partly cloudy sky and cloudy sky days in this study only non precipitation days were selected and the impact of cloud was not taken into consideration this may be the reason why more underestimation of daily et occurred in this study than in other clear sky based studies in the study of colaizzi et al 2006 the kc method performed better for cropland which is inconsistent with the findings of this study the possible reason may be that clear day and irrigated cropland were selected in colaizzi s study and the influence of soil moisture and cloud condition was smaller than in the case of the data used in this study as underestimation of daily et from instantaneous et may occur in many cases the discussion of the modified coefficient α is indispensable the results of this study showed that the optimal modified coefficients of wetland and cropland were obviously larger than those of other ecosystems the possible influencing factors might be atmospheric advection and the moisture condition of the underlying and vegetation fractions evapotranspiration from wetland and cropland systems may be enhanced by atmospheric advection moreover wetlands and croplands were under mild water stress or slight water stress with high vegetation fraction during the growth phase where the land surface temperature was less than that of other ecosystems longwave radiation was influenced by land surface temperature thus the longwave radiation of wetlands and croplands might be less than that of other ecosystems and may result in greater underestimation of ef the modified coefficient may be influenced by several factors the discussion of the modified coefficient in this study was only a preliminary evaluation deep research on the modified coefficient should be conducted and a theoretical model of the modified coefficient based on physical bases should be established in further studies tang and li 2017a furthermore the quality of the input data was foundational for the upscaling method comparison and evaluation additional comparisons with different data preparation methods and aggregating methods are necessary in future studies 5 summary and conclusion the objective of this study was to compare six methods for upscaling instantaneous le to daily le to provide reasonable suggestions for et estimation based on remote sensing technology the following conclusions were drawn from the study 1 there were large differences in estimated daily le based on different instantaneous le with the six upscaling methods in general the mef and sine methods only at specific times showed the best agreement with the measured le under the six ecosystems having the smallest mae values of 14 96 w m2 and 16 08 w m2 respectively the results also showed that the time of day had a significant influence on the performance of the six upscaling methods especially the sine method 2 the optimal method and instantaneous time used for le upscaling were quite different when characterized by ecosystem for the forest ecosystem the ef mef and sine methods performed best at 12 00 with mae ranging from 16 60 w m2to 19 01 w m2 and the kc mkc and rc methods performed best at 15 00 with an average mae of 19 91 w m2 the optimal instantaneous time occurred in the afternoon for grassland 13 00 savanna 13 00 wetland 14 00 and cropland 14 00 for shrublands the recommended instantaneous time was quite different among the different methods the ef kc and mkc methods worked best at 11 00 but the ef method achieved the smallest mae of 11 12 w m2 at the instantaneous time of 12 00 overall the mef method and the sine method were applicable for most ecosystems more attention should be paid to the selected instantaneous time when using the sine method as this method is more sensitive to time of day 3 the modified coefficient α used in the mef method was not a fixed value it varied with the time of day and the ecosystem ranging from 1 07 shrubland to 1 36 wetland the modified coefficient α of wetland 1 29 and cropland 1 24 was larger than that of other ecosystems 4 the mef method is the ideal upscaling method for most remotely sensed data however the modified coefficient α varied for different ecosystems more attention should be paid

neighbourhood in munich germany the living lab approach pursues the application of nature based solutions in a real planning case to achieve positive climate effects while densifying the neighbourhood the study is based on single event simulations of three return periods with the physically based software pcswmm the events are implemented for both current and climate change precipitation intensities of the rcp 8 5 projection for 2040 2069 three scenarios are implemented a status quo a business as usual scenario additional buildings without compensation measures and a best case scenario one additional floor with green roofs disconnected from the sewers in combination with rain gardens and porous pavements on the land parcels the comparison between the different scenarios focuses on three main aspects of the water balance namely infiltration runoff and storage the results show that measures for sustainable stormwater management are crucial elements to cope with an increasing number of heavy precipitation events due to climate change the best case scenario significantly outperforms the other two concerning water infiltration surface runoff and storage most notably is the impact of climate change projection rainfall intensities for 2040 2069 the outcomes for these intensities clearly show the positive impact of sustainable water sensitive design the

introduction today about 50 percent of the world s population lives in cities united nations 2019 with growing urbanisation worldwide it is predicted that about two thirds of the global population will live in urban environments by 2050 ibid munich bavaria germany where the study area of this work is located is one of few significantly growing big cities in germany current population of 1 5 million is predicted to increase by 18 8 to reach 1 85 million inhabitants by 2040 landeshauptstadt münchen 2019 2013 densification is a common approach to cope with the rapid growth densification as a planning strategy aims to constrain the expansion of built up area on agricultural land and natural landscapes in the outskirts by creating additional living space within already built areas sörensen et al 2016 in munich where land for further expansion is generally scarce potential for the implementation of densification lies within the reuse of derelict land e g of disused railway areas and infill development in existing residential areas landeshauptstadt münchen 2013 2011 however densification leads to further sealing of surfaces and the loss of green spaces with negative environmental impacts pauleit et al 2005 particularly temperature and wind flow patterns can be influenced fontenelle et al 2015 lemonsu et al 2015 moreover the amount of rainfall that can infiltrate is reduced while stormwater runoff to the sewer is increased haase 2009 kokkonen et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 yet densification can also be understood as a chance for sustainable urban development as densifying neighbourhoods promote resource and transport efficiency and undeveloped land out of town can be preserved as natural environment emilsson and sang 2017 climate change puts further pressure on cities according to the ipcc it is very likely that extreme precipitation events intensify in continental europe especially in winters kovats et al 2014 therefore the need for climate adaptation and mitigation is increasing alexander et al 2019 leandro et al 2020 kovats et al 2014 these challenges request a change in urban water management and urban planning in order to restore a city s natural hydrology integrated urban infrastructure solutions are needed that enable the city to act as a sponge griffiths et al 2020 this design aims to create specific flooding spaces storage capacities and to use rainwater as a resource international water association 2016 nguyen et al 2019 the main objective of stormwater management measures like green roofs permeable paving or rain gardens is to reduce stormwater runoff and increase retention and infiltration capacity davis and naumann 2017 unep 2014 berghage et al 2009 malaviya et al 2019 these measures are also referred to as nature based solutions in the following text as this concept includes climate change mitigation and adaptation by supporting amongst other things stormwater retention pauleit et al 2017 however with increasing integration of sustainable urban drainage systems today the focus lies also on recreational and aesthetical concerns water quality ecology of receiving waters restoration of the flow regime the use of the stormwater resource resilience and microclimate just to name the most relevant elements davis and naumann 2017 fletcher et al 2015 thus the potential of stormwater management measures is multifarious and offers various chances for adaptation and reduction of vulnerability of cities however there are still knowledge gaps about their effectiveness regarding adaptation and mitigation of climate change kabisch et al 2017 long term impacts and potentials still need to be systematically investigated in order to translate the knowledge into management approaches and policy instruments kabisch et al 2017 with respect to urban densification projects which are indispensable in rapidly growing cities where there is pressure for action to create more living space there is still little knowledge about the capacity of nature based solutions to compensate the increase of impervious surfaces particularly the frequency and magnitude of changing precipitation patterns through climate change increases the need to understand their impact on stormwater infrastructure mcgrane 2016 it needs to be determined to what extent sustainable rainwater management measures can compensate for increased imperviousness of urban areas the objective of this study is to investigate the hydrological impact of densification under altering return periods of heavy precipitation events through climate change in a residential area in munich germany the research approach of the study follows the concept of a living lab which includes a concrete planning case with its real framework conditions thus the effectiveness of individual rainwater management measures is not evaluated generically the impact of heavy rainfall events on infiltration runoff and storage of the area for three scenarios that exemplify the current situation a business as usual scenario and a best case scenario is examined the scenarios are examples for specific planning cases which could typically be implemented in this specific settlement type in order to densify the area the focus lies on the assessment of the performance of the stormwater management measures and the influence of additionally sealed surfaces for the named specific scenarios the study investigates whether the gain of living space can be combined with the enhancement of the water balance in the neighbourhood the study area of this work has a moderate density with lots of green space which largely remains even after densification the implemented measures comprise green roofs rain gardens and porous pavements as nature based solutions 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and input data the study area is located in the district moosach in munich bavaria germany and has a size of appr 6 8 ha it consists of linear three to four storey high blocks from the 1940s and 1950s that are highly energy inefficient and need renovation fig 1 characteristic for this type of settlement structure is the embedding of the buildings in a park like landscape the green spaces consist of monotonous lawns with trees that no longer meet the needs of the inhabitants referat für stadtplanung und bauordnung 2016 the sewer network data of the combined sewers in the study area are provided by the municipal drainage authority of munich further a digital elevation model dem land use data and an orthophoto are provided by the bavarian agency for digitisation high speed internet and surveying landesamt für digitalisierung 2018a 2018b 2018c three rainfall events with return periods of t 2 10 and 50 years are chosen to simulate a range of utmost extreme to more common events the extreme events are simulated to investigate the risk of flooding for return periods higher than the design storm used for calibration and the possibility to increase the capacity of the sewers through stormwater management measures the respective precipitation heights are taken from kostra coordinated heavy precipitation regionalization and evaluation of the german weather service kostra raster data offer precipitation heights depending on rainfall duration and return period extrapolated to a germany wide grid network with about 67 km2 per raster field the data are commonly used for dimensioning of water management structures deutscher wetterdienst 2020 to get close to real conditions a design storm based on the recommendations of german regulation dwa a 118 2006 the bavarian state office for water management and the bavarian state office for the environment is used bayerisches landesamt für umwelt 2019 bayerisches landesamt für wasserwirtschaft 2001a the design storms based on otter königer are given as standardized intensity gradients for five minute intervals bayerisches landesamt für wasserwirtschaft 2001b these design storms exist for duration levels from 15 to 720 min ibid the rainfall hydrographs consist of pre rain the main rainfall and after rain whereby the sum of the main rainfall equals the relevant precipitation height of the kostra table for the respective rainfall duration d 15 min and the selected raster cell bayerisches landesamt für wasserwirtschaft 2001a 2019 additional to current rainfall intensities future precipitation intensities based on the representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 are considered rcp 8 5 represents the highest climate change projection that was developed for the 5th ipcc assessment report ipcc 2014 the precipitation intensities for the rcp 8 5 were taken from chen 2018 who used simulated rainfall data from the climex project ludwig et al 2017 for this study the calculated rainfall intensities for the time period from 2040 2069 are chosen fig 2 illustrates the precipitation events for all return periods 2 2 rainfall runoff simulation with pcswmm the simulation of this work is done with the time discrete and physically based model pcswmm which is licensed by computational hydraulics international chi pcswmm is based on the swmm computational engine and can simulate several hydrological processes including surface runoff infiltration and flood routing james et al 2010 for this study swmm 5 was used if the water depth d exceeds the depression storage d p surface runoff q occurs depression storage depth d p surface roughness n and subcatchment width w are model parameters the process of infiltration is simulated with the horton method which is based on empirical observations infiltration is assumed to lower exponentially starting from an initial maximum infiltration rate to a minimum rate during long precipitation events the routing method solves the complete one dimensional saint venant flow equations swmm option dynamic wave routing the manning equation is used to relate flow rate to flow depth and friction slope ibid the green roof rain garden and porous pavement are implemented with the lid module in pcswmm the green roof implementation consists of a surface layer a soil layer and a drainage layer the flux terms surface runoff or underdrain outflow q and infiltration rate f represent functions of the respective water content of a layer for each layer a simple continuity equation is solved that depicts the difference between inflow and outflow water flux rates over time for rain gardens only a surface layer and a soil layer are implemented porous pavement elements consist of a surface layer a pavement layer which represents a pervious asphalt or concrete top layer and a gravel storage layer underneath rossmann and huber 2016 2 3 subcatchment delineation and parametrization the modelling area is delineated based on the provided sewer network data from the municipal drainage authority of munich the dem as well as the general drainage plan of the municipal drainage authority of munich abt stadtentwässerung der landeshauptstadt münchen 1969 the percentage of impervious land of a subcatchment is based on data from the municipal drainage authority of munich and on land use data attributes for the manning n for overland flow regarding the impervious or pervious area of the subcatchment are taken from hios 2019 the depression storage of the pervious and impervious parts of the subcatchments are calculated with the sinks toolbox in arcmap based on the dem the infiltration settings are based on the horton infiltration method with a maximum infiltration rate of 50 80 mm hr 1 and a minimum infiltration rate of 29 97 mm hr 1 these attributes are implemented based on recommendations of chi for the soil classification of the soil map of munich that classifies most of the soil in the modelling area as loamy sand the maximum infiltration rate is chosen for partially dried out soils chi 2019 landeshauptstadt münchen 2019 2 4 calibration and validation the sewer model is calibrated and validated based on the european standard regulation din en 752 2017 that defines design standards for sewers according to this regulation sewers can be fully filled however no surcharge for a 5 year return period rainfall event in city centres industrial and commercial areas should occur for this purpose the design storm for t 5 is used fig 2 the sewer network implemented in the model is larger than the study area in which the scenarios are implemented this is done in order to create realistic inflow conditions into the study area and to account for backwater effects that occur inside the sewer network the sewer network area is defined by the sewers and subcatchments that drain into the study area calibration and validation are done by changing the model structure the model structure needs to be adjusted because with the initial catchment setup the sewer model could not cope with the design standard specified by the din en 752 2017 about 50 manholes were surcharging in this setup different model structures were thereby tested by subdividing the catchment into smaller subcatchments with this process the area assigned to each manhole is refined and a more realistic drainage network is obtained this is a quite laborious work because each iteration requires the manual adjustment of the catchments fig 3 shows the subcatchments before and after the calibration and validation process the validation is considered complete once the design storm for t 5 does not cause flooding of the sewer network some subcatchments have not been further subdivided because the design storm t 5 did not cause flooding a classical calibration validation approach based on measured data is not possible since measured data is not available field monitoring data although ideal would have not be feasible within the time frame of this study lack of field data is a recognized problem in urban flood model validation leandro et al 2011 hence most practitioners are left to approaches such as the one followed in this study to handle calibration and validation of a sewer network model 2 5 scenarios of urban densification and local stormwater management to investigate the quantitative hydrological impact of the densification and stormwater management measures three scenarios are implemented the status quo the business as usual scenario and the best case scenario we created the densification scenarios based on the current state of knowledge about common infill strategies in the city and reference projects of similar building types the status quo scenario represents the current situation of the study area fig 4 it is used as a comparative basis for the densification scenarios the linear buildings are equipped with pitched tiled roofs the existing underground car park is assumed to be equipped with a soil cover of 60 cm which corresponds to the minimum standard of the city landeshauptstadt münchen 1996 all runoff from the underground car park roof is directed to the sewers the business as usual scenario fig 5 represents the consequences of possible additional buildings in the study area the assumptions for the additional buildings are based on a densification project in munich hasenbergl where buildings in form of crossbars were added to the linear residential complexes bmi 2013 in this scenario of densification approximately 17 living space compared to the status quo is gained if all additional buildings have four storeys as the existing buildings the scenario covers the consequences of additional buildings without any compensation measures like green roofs or other measures that could balance additional sealed surfaces hence the additional buildings are equipped with impervious roofing material for munich the regulation of the city states that for each apartment one parking space is necessary if no further provisions are made landeshauptstadt münchen 2007 therefore we implemented two additional underground car parks with a soil cover of 60 cm all runoff from roofs of buildings as well as underground car parks is drained into the sewers the best case scenario attempts to reduce the effects of redensification on the retention capacity of the area it does not include additional buildings in order to avoid additional sealed area fig 6 instead the scenario comprises the addition of one storey with a flat roof on the existing buildings this results in 25 additional area for apartments compared to the current state the additional storey is covered by a green roof with 20 cm soil substrate thickness which is double the minimum thickness of the current standard of the city referat für gesundheit und umwelt 2019 this green roof thickness is chosen to represent a best possible yet achievable scenario as in the business as usual scenario we added two additional underground car parks both existing and supplementary underground car parks have a soil cover thickness of 1 0 m additionally all roofs are disconnected from the sewer system and connected to rain gardens that are distributed over the land parcels rain gardens are small scale landscaped depressions with native vegetation that are designed for infiltration filtering and storage of stormwater typically rain gardens are installed close to buildings and are conceptualized to endure high amounts of precipitation and runoff by the integration of soil substrates with high permeability european commission 2013 osheen and singh 2019 based on recommendations of german regulation dwa a 138 2005 the size of rain gardens is about 20 of the connected roof area the footpaths in the study area around the houses are currently mostly impervious and connected to the sewer these impervious areas are herein replaced with porous pavement figs 7 9 show schematic layouts of the sustainable stormwater management measures and their corresponding parameters fig 10 shows the flow scheme of each stormwater management measure table 1 gives an overview of the land use shares of each scenario the model settings for the subcatchments of all scenarios are based on partially dried out soil conditions as input attributes for the infiltration properties the settings for the stormwater management measures green roof and rain garden correspond to dried out soils in order to assess the impact of the initial soil saturation on the results we run all three scenarios for the return period t 50 with altered infiltration settings for all subcatchments the maximum infiltration rate is changed from 50 8 mm hr 1 to 30 5 mm hr 1 which is close to the minimum infiltration rate of 29 97 mm hr 1 these values are based on the soil map of munich that classifies the majority of soils in the study area as loamy sand landeshauptstadt münchen 2019 and recommendations of chi 2019 the minimum infiltration rate is equal to the saturated hydraulic conductivity i e assuming that the soil is close to saturation for all green roofs and rain gardens the respective field capacity is decreased to 0 15 volume fraction to account for a lower capacity of the soil to retain the water with a wilting point at 0 1 volume fraction the plant available water is then 0 05 volume fraction 3 results 3 1 infiltration runoff and storage fig 11 shows the results for infiltration runoff and storage for the scenarios and respective precipitation events the scenarios climate change and initially saturated soil conditions impact the volumes of runoff infiltration and storage in comparison with the business as usual scenario the subcatchments in the best case scenario infiltrated between 16 7 for t 50 and 17 2 for t 2 both current rainfall intensities and rcp 8 5 more and decreased the runoff between 29 7 t 50 rcp 8 5 and 38 4 t 10 the storage increased between 12 9 t 50 rcp 8 5 and 21 6 t 10 3 2 performance of stormwater management measures the performance of green roofs and rain gardens is characterized by the ratio between inflow storage and outflow for t 2 the elements can retain all water that flows in therefore the following figures only summarize the results for t 10 and t 50 figs 12 13 and 15 show the results for the stormwater management measures implemented in the best case scenario fig 14 displays the results for the green roofs on the underground car parks in the business as usual scenario thickness of 0 6 m green roofs on the buildings can store all water up to a current precipitation event of t 10 fig 12 however the same event in 2040 2069 rcp 8 5 cannot be fully retained even if the green roof is not able to store the same volume of incoming water under initially saturated conditions compared to partially dried out soil conditions t 50 the surface runoff stays the same the excess water is released via drain outflow which increases the time lag of the runoff moreover independently of the soil substrate thickness on underground car parks the storage and surface runoff volumes are the same for both best case and business as usual scenario figs 13 14 rain gardens make a significant contribution to the storage of stormwater even under climate change conditions fig 15 even in the extreme event of t 50 rcp 8 5 still almost 40 of inflows can be stored for the initially saturated soil conditions the rain gardens store fundamentally less water than the t 50 event with partly dried out soil conditions i e 11 0 compared to 73 5 of all inflows moreover the surface runoff nearly triples yet it must be noticed that the inflows from the green roofs approximately triple as well further the rain gardens release about 12 of incoming water in form of infiltration into the native soil underneath the performance of the porous pavement is surprisingly consistent for all return periods no surface runoff occurs and all water is infiltrated water in porous paving infiltrates into the underlying soil substrate according to the soil infiltration rate 4 discussion 4 1 infiltration runoff and storage overall the results indicate that the implementation of the sustainable stormwater management measures in the best case scenario have a crucial impact on the study area s water balance by significantly reducing the surface runoff this applies to all return periods in the best case scenario compared to status quo and the business as usual scenario the change of percentage differences in fig 11 shows that the infiltration and storage capacity of the nature based solutions decreases with increasing rainfall intensity therefore the highest proportionate differences are noted for t 2 for infiltration interestingly the highest difference of runoff and storage occurs for t 10 this can be explained by the maximum storage volume of the subcatchments that is independent of the rainfall intensity hence the share of water stored is lower for higher rainfall intensities even though the maximum volume stays the same infiltration runoff and storage changes only slightly between the status quo and the business as usual scenario fig 10 this compensation of stormwater runoff from the additional buildings is accomplished with green roofs on the supplementary underground car parks with a thickness of 0 6 m due to a high infiltration and storage capacity of the engineered soil substrates on the underground car parks their infiltration is higher than the native soils therefore the negative hydrological impact in terms of runoff increase through additionally sealed area by buildings is marginal compared to the current situation however this does not include the potential effect of underground car parks on the soil s natural water balance and groundwater recharge which was not assessed in this study the results of the initially saturated conditions for t 50 fig 11 show the substantial impact of the soil s water content at the beginning especially the surface runoff gains for the best case scenario compared to the partially dried out soil conditions is noticeable however it must be noted that the status quo and business as usual scenario have a considerably higher amount of impervious area i e 2 0 and 2 1 ha respectively compared to 0 4 ha in the best case scenario for these areas there are no changes in case of modified soil moisture conditions and water cannot infiltrate or be stored independent of initial soil humidity overall with a total of 32 5 runoff of the total rainfall volume the best case scenario nevertheless outperforms the other two cases where the runoff share is 59 5 status quo and 59 9 business as usual scenario therefore even for this unfavourable starting condition and an extreme rainfall with a return period of 50 years the implemented nature based solutions can still contribute positively to the water balance of the area the significant impact of the moisture condition in urban environments is also shown by hettiarachchi et al 2019 who examined stormwater management features however the number of studies on the effect of saturated soil conditions on hydrology in urban catchments is limited ibid 4 2 performance of stormwater management measures climate change makes a considerable impact on the effectiveness of the stormwater management measures a substrate thickness of 20 cm on the building roofs is necessary to store rainfall heights up to a ten year return period a thinner roof might still prevent a large share of rain to generate runoff however with respect to the increase of extreme events the investment in a minimum 20 cm thick green roof surely pays off also the initial soil moisture impacts the share of outflow of the green roofs however an increase of substrate thickness on the underground car park does not lead to more water being stored under conditions of high rainfall intensity this finding can be explained by the soil s infiltration rate that is independent of the soil depth the depth of the soil layer on these underground car parks largely determines the amount of runoff in case the soils are not fully dried out or saturated before the rainfall event while substrates with a depth of 0 6 m in the business as usual scenario releases about 12 0 of the rainfall as outflow fig 14 the whole water volume is still stored when the substrates have a depth of 1 0 m fig 13 comparing with studies on green roof performance by mentens et al 2006 and lee et al 2015 this study shows a similar if not a better performance of stormwater measures the influence of the thickness of the soil substrate the initial water content and the precipitation height on the green roof s performance as stated by berndtsson 2010 is supported by the results of this study especially the rainfall intensity makes a strong impact on a green roof s storage and outflow volumes the installation of rain gardens lowers the volume of surface runoff and the sewer load and can contribute to groundwater recharge with a size of about 20 of the draining area the results show that this share is reasonable the performance of rain gardens is strongly influenced by the temperature muthanna et al 2008 moreover previous dry periods which correspond to the initial water content of the soil can affect the performance of a rain garden ibid the influence of the ambient temperature was not studied in this work the influence of the initial soil moisture however is clearly demonstrated the seasonal variability and the dependency of vegetation growth and soil compaction carpenter and hallam 2008 jiang et al 2017 could not be investigated in this work due to the decision to model single events pitt and voorhees 2011 observed a 90 percent annual reduction of sewer inflows in kansas city usa by the introduction of rain gardens with an annual precipitation height of approximately 1000 mm in kansas city national weather service n d it roughly corresponds to the annual rainfall in munich bayerisches landesamt für umwelt 2018 since this work modelled single events and no long time simulation a direct comparison is not possible however the results show that for current precipitation rainfalls up to a return period of ten years can be stored in the rain gardens therefore we suggest that an estimated retention of 90 annual precipitation can be assumed to be plausible for this study as well porous pavements offer a straightforward possibility to increase the infiltration of areas like footpaths or cycle tracks the efficiency of the porous pavement strongly depends on the infiltration rate f 1 of the surface layer this factor f 1 in pcswmm only depends on the precipitation and additional inflows and the water depth on the surface it is limited by the void fraction of the storage layer the moisture content of the pavement layer the pavement s thickness and the exfiltration rate of water from the storage layer into the native soil rossmann and huber 2016 overall the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the native soil beneath and the storage capacity of the porous pavement elements is assumed to be large enough to retain all inflow studies about the performance of porous pavement show that their long term performance is overall steady brattebo and booth 2003 in this study only the short term performance of porous pavements is evaluated the results indicate that all inflows are infiltrated in the underlying native soil or stored in the gravel storage layer underneath the porous top layer this demonstrates that the infiltration compared to standard asphalt is throughout higher as stated also by drake et al 2013 4 3 limitations of this study further impacts of increased infiltration capacity and decrease of runoff are important factors the resulting effects of nature based solutions on soils and groundwater recharge by increased infiltration are central moreover water stored by the various stormwater retention measures increases the rate of evapotranspiration and provides a cooling effect for buildings and the surroundings unep 2014 european commission 2013 however the study did not consider co benefits of stormwater measures such as temperature regulation from evapotranspiration rahman et al 2017 zölch et al 2016 nor did it assess seasonal influences on the performance of the sustainable stormwater management measures the temporal overlap of extreme precipitation events with different soil saturation conditions can potentially vary the performance of stormwater management measures the study is based on single event modelling which does not account for initial soil and porous surface saturation or the duration between precipitation events further the impact of climate change on cycles of soil saturation could not be considered in the single event approach and is therefore a limitation of this study in order to limit the scope of our approach the comparison between the different scenarios is based solely on the water balance i e infiltration runoff and storage and not on the temporal changes of the processes a more detailed consideration of material characteristics or the age of the measures was equally beyond the scope of this study the simulation of flood inundation areas water depth and flow velocities for extreme precipitation events can be better represented by coupled 1d 2d urban flood models the application of such approaches would likely lead to a more in depth understanding of the hydrological dynamics particularly concerning the flow exchange between surface runoff and sewer system however while overland flows over the terrain are better simulated by 1d 2d models they are also computationally more expensive and limit therefore the number of simulations feasible under deadline constrains leandro et al 2009 5 conclusion densification can reduce urban sprawl in growing cities the approach to densification should consider environmental impacts from the outset since densification can entail adverse environmental effects and thus reduce quality of life in the city if not planned wisely sustainable stormwater management measures need to be integrated into densification schemes however whether stormwater management measures can be installed depends on the overall built density of the area the results presented in this paper indicate that disconnected green roofs rain gardens and porous pavements are substantial nature based solutions to cope with an increasing intensity of heavy precipitation events due to climate change the results show about 38 of runoff reduction for the best case scenario compared to the business as usual scenario while increasing the living space about 8 more while the specific site factors of this study limit the generalizability of the results this approach nevertheless provides new insights into the impacts and opportunities of densifying neighbourhoods this study clearly demonstrates that the addition of storeys on already existing buildings in combination with stormwater management measures is preferable for this settlement type both in terms of increase of residential floor space as well as concerning the reduction of stormwater runoff and water balance improvement when compared to additional buildings whether storeys can be added depends on the specific bearing capacity of the existing buildings such calculations fall outside of the scope of this study a substrate thickness of 20 cm on the building roofs is necessary to store rainfall heights up to a ten year return period with respect to the increase of extreme events the installation of a minimum 20 cm thick green roof is advisable the share of runoff from green roofs on underground car parks is determined by the soil moisture conditions at the time of a rainfall event the installation of rain gardens with a size of about 20 of the draining area and porous pavements lower the volume of surface runoff and can contribute to groundwater recharge generally it is worth noticing that the results show a strong impact of the increase in precipitation intensities due to climate change on the performance of the stormwater management measures the projections for 2040 2068 demonstrate that the current situation and the implementation of more buildings without any compensation measures face severe problems in terms of stormwater management the same is valid for the best case scenario with various sustainable stormwater management measures implemented however the impact is in total still much lower compared to the results of the other two scenarios this indicates that the business as usual attitude of disregarding water sensitive design considerations is no longer suitable for this case study yet depending on the approach of densification the gain of living space can be combined with the enhancement of the water balance in residential areas this study based on a real planning case has shown that the implementation of nature based solutions is key to achieving this mutual gain further research could address the long term potential of nature based solutions to compensate densification under the impact of climate change the influence of climate change alters the return periods of precipitation events this increases the importance of including different moisture conditions as well as their temporal overlap with extreme precipitation events in future long term studies to investigate their influence on the performance of stormwater management measures furthermore future studies should investigate the measures capacity to lower air temperature on hot days via evapotranspiration besides coupled 1d 2d models can bring new insights into the effectiveness of stormwater management measures in terms of surface flow patterns and

water impervious area which increases the vulnerability to flooding during extreme precipitation events sustainable urban drainage systems are considered as a strategy to handle stormwater runoff locally and thus relieve the sewage system this study investigates the combined quantitative hydrological impact of densification and sustainable stormwater management measures in a residential neighbourhood in munich germany the living lab approach pursues the application of nature based solutions in a real planning case to achieve positive climate effects while densifying the neighbourhood the study is based on single event simulations of three return periods with the physically based software pcswmm the events are implemented for both current and climate change precipitation intensities of the rcp 8 5 projection for 2040 2069 three scenarios are implemented a status quo a business as usual scenario additional buildings without compensation measures and a best case scenario one additional floor with green roofs disconnected from the sewers in combination with rain gardens and porous pavements on the land parcels the comparison between the different scenarios focuses on three main aspects of the water balance namely infiltration runoff and storage the results show that measures for sustainable stormwater management are crucial elements to cope with an increasing number of heavy precipitation events due to climate change the best case scenario significantly outperforms the other two concerning water infiltration surface runoff and storage most notably is the impact of climate change projection rainfall intensities for 2040 2069 the outcomes for these intensities clearly show the positive impact of sustainable water sensitive design the results demonstrate that it is in fact possible to enhance the water balance and gain new living space simultaneously if a sustainable urban planning strategy is implemented that includes future

introduction today about 50 percent of the world s population lives in cities united nations 2019 with growing urbanisation worldwide it is predicted that about two thirds of the global population will live in urban environments by 2050 ibid munich bavaria germany where the study area of this work is located is one of few significantly growing big cities in germany current population of 1 5 million is predicted to increase by 18 8 to reach 1 85 million inhabitants by 2040 landeshauptstadt münchen 2019 2013 densification is a common approach to cope with the rapid growth densification as a planning strategy aims to constrain the expansion of built up area on agricultural land and natural landscapes in the outskirts by creating additional living space within already built areas sörensen et al 2016 in munich where land for further expansion is generally scarce potential for the implementation of densification lies within the reuse of derelict land e g of disused railway areas and infill development in existing residential areas landeshauptstadt münchen 2013 2011 however densification leads to further sealing of surfaces and the loss of green spaces with negative environmental impacts pauleit et al 2005 particularly temperature and wind flow patterns can be influenced fontenelle et al 2015 lemonsu et al 2015 moreover the amount of rainfall that can infiltrate is reduced while stormwater runoff to the sewer is increased haase 2009 kokkonen et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 yet densification can also be understood as a chance for sustainable urban development as densifying neighbourhoods promote resource and transport efficiency and undeveloped land out of town can be preserved as natural environment emilsson and sang 2017 climate change puts further pressure on cities according to the ipcc it is very likely that extreme precipitation events intensify in continental europe especially in winters kovats et al 2014 therefore the need for climate adaptation and mitigation is increasing alexander et al 2019 leandro et al 2020 kovats et al 2014 these challenges request a change in urban water management and urban planning in order to restore a city s natural hydrology integrated urban infrastructure solutions are needed that enable the city to act as a sponge griffiths et al 2020 this design aims to create specific flooding spaces storage capacities and to use rainwater as a resource international water association 2016 nguyen et al 2019 the main objective of stormwater management measures like green roofs permeable paving or rain gardens is to reduce stormwater runoff and increase retention and infiltration capacity davis and naumann 2017 unep 2014 berghage et al 2009 malaviya et al 2019 these measures are also referred to as nature based solutions in the following text as this concept includes climate change mitigation and adaptation by supporting amongst other things stormwater retention pauleit et al 2017 however with increasing integration of sustainable urban drainage systems today the focus lies also on recreational and aesthetical concerns water quality ecology of receiving waters restoration of the flow regime the use of the stormwater resource resilience and microclimate just to name the most relevant elements davis and naumann 2017 fletcher et al 2015 thus the potential of stormwater management measures is multifarious and offers various chances for adaptation and reduction of vulnerability of cities however there are still knowledge gaps about their effectiveness regarding adaptation and mitigation of climate change kabisch et al 2017 long term impacts and potentials still need to be systematically investigated in order to translate the knowledge into management approaches and policy instruments kabisch et al 2017 with respect to urban densification projects which are indispensable in rapidly growing cities where there is pressure for action to create more living space there is still little knowledge about the capacity of nature based solutions to compensate the increase of impervious surfaces particularly the frequency and magnitude of changing precipitation patterns through climate change increases the need to understand their impact on stormwater infrastructure mcgrane 2016 it needs to be determined to what extent sustainable rainwater management measures can compensate for increased imperviousness of urban areas the objective of this study is to investigate the hydrological impact of densification under altering return periods of heavy precipitation events through climate change in a residential area in munich germany the research approach of the study follows the concept of a living lab which includes a concrete planning case with its real framework conditions thus the effectiveness of individual rainwater management measures is not evaluated generically the impact of heavy rainfall events on infiltration runoff and storage of the area for three scenarios that exemplify the current situation a business as usual scenario and a best case scenario is examined the scenarios are examples for specific planning cases which could typically be implemented in this specific settlement type in order to densify the area the focus lies on the assessment of the performance of the stormwater management measures and the influence of additionally sealed surfaces for the named specific scenarios the study investigates whether the gain of living space can be combined with the enhancement of the water balance in the neighbourhood the study area of this work has a moderate density with lots of green space which largely remains even after densification the implemented measures comprise green roofs rain gardens and porous pavements as nature based solutions 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and input data the study area is located in the district moosach in munich bavaria germany and has a size of appr 6 8 ha it consists of linear three to four storey high blocks from the 1940s and 1950s that are highly energy inefficient and need renovation fig 1 characteristic for this type of settlement structure is the embedding of the buildings in a park like landscape the green spaces consist of monotonous lawns with trees that no longer meet the needs of the inhabitants referat für stadtplanung und bauordnung 2016 the sewer network data of the combined sewers in the study area are provided by the municipal drainage authority of munich further a digital elevation model dem land use data and an orthophoto are provided by the bavarian agency for digitisation high speed internet and surveying landesamt für digitalisierung 2018a 2018b 2018c three rainfall events with return periods of t 2 10 and 50 years are chosen to simulate a range of utmost extreme to more common events the extreme events are simulated to investigate the risk of flooding for return periods higher than the design storm used for calibration and the possibility to increase the capacity of the sewers through stormwater management measures the respective precipitation heights are taken from kostra coordinated heavy precipitation regionalization and evaluation of the german weather service kostra raster data offer precipitation heights depending on rainfall duration and return period extrapolated to a germany wide grid network with about 67 km2 per raster field the data are commonly used for dimensioning of water management structures deutscher wetterdienst 2020 to get close to real conditions a design storm based on the recommendations of german regulation dwa a 118 2006 the bavarian state office for water management and the bavarian state office for the environment is used bayerisches landesamt für umwelt 2019 bayerisches landesamt für wasserwirtschaft 2001a the design storms based on otter königer are given as standardized intensity gradients for five minute intervals bayerisches landesamt für wasserwirtschaft 2001b these design storms exist for duration levels from 15 to 720 min ibid the rainfall hydrographs consist of pre rain the main rainfall and after rain whereby the sum of the main rainfall equals the relevant precipitation height of the kostra table for the respective rainfall duration d 15 min and the selected raster cell bayerisches landesamt für wasserwirtschaft 2001a 2019 additional to current rainfall intensities future precipitation intensities based on the representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 are considered rcp 8 5 represents the highest climate change projection that was developed for the 5th ipcc assessment report ipcc 2014 the precipitation intensities for the rcp 8 5 were taken from chen 2018 who used simulated rainfall data from the climex project ludwig et al 2017 for this study the calculated rainfall intensities for the time period from 2040 2069 are chosen fig 2 illustrates the precipitation events for all return periods 2 2 rainfall runoff simulation with pcswmm the simulation of this work is done with the time discrete and physically based model pcswmm which is licensed by computational hydraulics international chi pcswmm is based on the swmm computational engine and can simulate several hydrological processes including surface runoff infiltration and flood routing james et al 2010 for this study swmm 5 was used if the water depth d exceeds the depression storage d p surface runoff q occurs depression storage depth d p surface roughness n and subcatchment width w are model parameters the process of infiltration is simulated with the horton method which is based on empirical observations infiltration is assumed to lower exponentially starting from an initial maximum infiltration rate to a minimum rate during long precipitation events the routing method solves the complete one dimensional saint venant flow equations swmm option dynamic wave routing the manning equation is used to relate flow rate to flow depth and friction slope ibid the green roof rain garden and porous pavement are implemented with the lid module in pcswmm the green roof implementation consists of a surface layer a soil layer and a drainage layer the flux terms surface runoff or underdrain outflow q and infiltration rate f represent functions of the respective water content of a layer for each layer a simple continuity equation is solved that depicts the difference between inflow and outflow water flux rates over time for rain gardens only a surface layer and a soil layer are implemented porous pavement elements consist of a surface layer a pavement layer which represents a pervious asphalt or concrete top layer and a gravel storage layer underneath rossmann and huber 2016 2 3 subcatchment delineation and parametrization the modelling area is delineated based on the provided sewer network data from the municipal drainage authority of munich the dem as well as the general drainage plan of the municipal drainage authority of munich abt stadtentwässerung der landeshauptstadt münchen 1969 the percentage of impervious land of a subcatchment is based on data from the municipal drainage authority of munich and on land use data attributes for the manning n for overland flow regarding the impervious or pervious area of the subcatchment are taken from hios 2019 the depression storage of the pervious and impervious parts of the subcatchments are calculated with the sinks toolbox in arcmap based on the dem the infiltration settings are based on the horton infiltration method with a maximum infiltration rate of 50 80 mm hr 1 and a minimum infiltration rate of 29 97 mm hr 1 these attributes are implemented based on recommendations of chi for the soil classification of the soil map of munich that classifies most of the soil in the modelling area as loamy sand the maximum infiltration rate is chosen for partially dried out soils chi 2019 landeshauptstadt münchen 2019 2 4 calibration and validation the sewer model is calibrated and validated based on the european standard regulation din en 752 2017 that defines design standards for sewers according to this regulation sewers can be fully filled however no surcharge for a 5 year return period rainfall event in city centres industrial and commercial areas should occur for this purpose the design storm for t 5 is used fig 2 the sewer network implemented in the model is larger than the study area in which the scenarios are implemented this is done in order to create realistic inflow conditions into the study area and to account for backwater effects that occur inside the sewer network the sewer network area is defined by the sewers and subcatchments that drain into the study area calibration and validation are done by changing the model structure the model structure needs to be adjusted because with the initial catchment setup the sewer model could not cope with the design standard specified by the din en 752 2017 about 50 manholes were surcharging in this setup different model structures were thereby tested by subdividing the catchment into smaller subcatchments with this process the area assigned to each manhole is refined and a more realistic drainage network is obtained this is a quite laborious work because each iteration requires the manual adjustment of the catchments fig 3 shows the subcatchments before and after the calibration and validation process the validation is considered complete once the design storm for t 5 does not cause flooding of the sewer network some subcatchments have not been further subdivided because the design storm t 5 did not cause flooding a classical calibration validation approach based on measured data is not possible since measured data is not available field monitoring data although ideal would have not be feasible within the time frame of this study lack of field data is a recognized problem in urban flood model validation leandro et al 2011 hence most practitioners are left to approaches such as the one followed in this study to handle calibration and validation of a sewer network model 2 5 scenarios of urban densification and local stormwater management to investigate the quantitative hydrological impact of the densification and stormwater management measures three scenarios are implemented the status quo the business as usual scenario and the best case scenario we created the densification scenarios based on the current state of knowledge about common infill strategies in the city and reference projects of similar building types the status quo scenario represents the current situation of the study area fig 4 it is used as a comparative basis for the densification scenarios the linear buildings are equipped with pitched tiled roofs the existing underground car park is assumed to be equipped with a soil cover of 60 cm which corresponds to the minimum standard of the city landeshauptstadt münchen 1996 all runoff from the underground car park roof is directed to the sewers the business as usual scenario fig 5 represents the consequences of possible additional buildings in the study area the assumptions for the additional buildings are based on a densification project in munich hasenbergl where buildings in form of crossbars were added to the linear residential complexes bmi 2013 in this scenario of densification approximately 17 living space compared to the status quo is gained if all additional buildings have four storeys as the existing buildings the scenario covers the consequences of additional buildings without any compensation measures like green roofs or other measures that could balance additional sealed surfaces hence the additional buildings are equipped with impervious roofing material for munich the regulation of the city states that for each apartment one parking space is necessary if no further provisions are made landeshauptstadt münchen 2007 therefore we implemented two additional underground car parks with a soil cover of 60 cm all runoff from roofs of buildings as well as underground car parks is drained into the sewers the best case scenario attempts to reduce the effects of redensification on the retention capacity of the area it does not include additional buildings in order to avoid additional sealed area fig 6 instead the scenario comprises the addition of one storey with a flat roof on the existing buildings this results in 25 additional area for apartments compared to the current state the additional storey is covered by a green roof with 20 cm soil substrate thickness which is double the minimum thickness of the current standard of the city referat für gesundheit und umwelt 2019 this green roof thickness is chosen to represent a best possible yet achievable scenario as in the business as usual scenario we added two additional underground car parks both existing and supplementary underground car parks have a soil cover thickness of 1 0 m additionally all roofs are disconnected from the sewer system and connected to rain gardens that are distributed over the land parcels rain gardens are small scale landscaped depressions with native vegetation that are designed for infiltration filtering and storage of stormwater typically rain gardens are installed close to buildings and are conceptualized to endure high amounts of precipitation and runoff by the integration of soil substrates with high permeability european commission 2013 osheen and singh 2019 based on recommendations of german regulation dwa a 138 2005 the size of rain gardens is about 20 of the connected roof area the footpaths in the study area around the houses are currently mostly impervious and connected to the sewer these impervious areas are herein replaced with porous pavement figs 7 9 show schematic layouts of the sustainable stormwater management measures and their corresponding parameters fig 10 shows the flow scheme of each stormwater management measure table 1 gives an overview of the land use shares of each scenario the model settings for the subcatchments of all scenarios are based on partially dried out soil conditions as input attributes for the infiltration properties the settings for the stormwater management measures green roof and rain garden correspond to dried out soils in order to assess the impact of the initial soil saturation on the results we run all three scenarios for the return period t 50 with altered infiltration settings for all subcatchments the maximum infiltration rate is changed from 50 8 mm hr 1 to 30 5 mm hr 1 which is close to the minimum infiltration rate of 29 97 mm hr 1 these values are based on the soil map of munich that classifies the majority of soils in the study area as loamy sand landeshauptstadt münchen 2019 and recommendations of chi 2019 the minimum infiltration rate is equal to the saturated hydraulic conductivity i e assuming that the soil is close to saturation for all green roofs and rain gardens the respective field capacity is decreased to 0 15 volume fraction to account for a lower capacity of the soil to retain the water with a wilting point at 0 1 volume fraction the plant available water is then 0 05 volume fraction 3 results 3 1 infiltration runoff and storage fig 11 shows the results for infiltration runoff and storage for the scenarios and respective precipitation events the scenarios climate change and initially saturated soil conditions impact the volumes of runoff infiltration and storage in comparison with the business as usual scenario the subcatchments in the best case scenario infiltrated between 16 7 for t 50 and 17 2 for t 2 both current rainfall intensities and rcp 8 5 more and decreased the runoff between 29 7 t 50 rcp 8 5 and 38 4 t 10 the storage increased between 12 9 t 50 rcp 8 5 and 21 6 t 10 3 2 performance of stormwater management measures the performance of green roofs and rain gardens is characterized by the ratio between inflow storage and outflow for t 2 the elements can retain all water that flows in therefore the following figures only summarize the results for t 10 and t 50 figs 12 13 and 15 show the results for the stormwater management measures implemented in the best case scenario fig 14 displays the results for the green roofs on the underground car parks in the business as usual scenario thickness of 0 6 m green roofs on the buildings can store all water up to a current precipitation event of t 10 fig 12 however the same event in 2040 2069 rcp 8 5 cannot be fully retained even if the green roof is not able to store the same volume of incoming water under initially saturated conditions compared to partially dried out soil conditions t 50 the surface runoff stays the same the excess water is released via drain outflow which increases the time lag of the runoff moreover independently of the soil substrate thickness on underground car parks the storage and surface runoff volumes are the same for both best case and business as usual scenario figs 13 14 rain gardens make a significant contribution to the storage of stormwater even under climate change conditions fig 15 even in the extreme event of t 50 rcp 8 5 still almost 40 of inflows can be stored for the initially saturated soil conditions the rain gardens store fundamentally less water than the t 50 event with partly dried out soil conditions i e 11 0 compared to 73 5 of all inflows moreover the surface runoff nearly triples yet it must be noticed that the inflows from the green roofs approximately triple as well further the rain gardens release about 12 of incoming water in form of infiltration into the native soil underneath the performance of the porous pavement is surprisingly consistent for all return periods no surface runoff occurs and all water is infiltrated water in porous paving infiltrates into the underlying soil substrate according to the soil infiltration rate 4 discussion 4 1 infiltration runoff and storage overall the results indicate that the implementation of the sustainable stormwater management measures in the best case scenario have a crucial impact on the study area s water balance by significantly reducing the surface runoff this applies to all return periods in the best case scenario compared to status quo and the business as usual scenario the change of percentage differences in fig 11 shows that the infiltration and storage capacity of the nature based solutions decreases with increasing rainfall intensity therefore the highest proportionate differences are noted for t 2 for infiltration interestingly the highest difference of runoff and storage occurs for t 10 this can be explained by the maximum storage volume of the subcatchments that is independent of the rainfall intensity hence the share of water stored is lower for higher rainfall intensities even though the maximum volume stays the same infiltration runoff and storage changes only slightly between the status quo and the business as usual scenario fig 10 this compensation of stormwater runoff from the additional buildings is accomplished with green roofs on the supplementary underground car parks with a thickness of 0 6 m due to a high infiltration and storage capacity of the engineered soil substrates on the underground car parks their infiltration is higher than the native soils therefore the negative hydrological impact in terms of runoff increase through additionally sealed area by buildings is marginal compared to the current situation however this does not include the potential effect of underground car parks on the soil s natural water balance and groundwater recharge which was not assessed in this study the results of the initially saturated conditions for t 50 fig 11 show the substantial impact of the soil s water content at the beginning especially the surface runoff gains for the best case scenario compared to the partially dried out soil conditions is noticeable however it must be noted that the status quo and business as usual scenario have a considerably higher amount of impervious area i e 2 0 and 2 1 ha respectively compared to 0 4 ha in the best case scenario for these areas there are no changes in case of modified soil moisture conditions and water cannot infiltrate or be stored independent of initial soil humidity overall with a total of 32 5 runoff of the total rainfall volume the best case scenario nevertheless outperforms the other two cases where the runoff share is 59 5 status quo and 59 9 business as usual scenario therefore even for this unfavourable starting condition and an extreme rainfall with a return period of 50 years the implemented nature based solutions can still contribute positively to the water balance of the area the significant impact of the moisture condition in urban environments is also shown by hettiarachchi et al 2019 who examined stormwater management features however the number of studies on the effect of saturated soil conditions on hydrology in urban catchments is limited ibid 4 2 performance of stormwater management measures climate change makes a considerable impact on the effectiveness of the stormwater management measures a substrate thickness of 20 cm on the building roofs is necessary to store rainfall heights up to a ten year return period a thinner roof might still prevent a large share of rain to generate runoff however with respect to the increase of extreme events the investment in a minimum 20 cm thick green roof surely pays off also the initial soil moisture impacts the share of outflow of the green roofs however an increase of substrate thickness on the underground car park does not lead to more water being stored under conditions of high rainfall intensity this finding can be explained by the soil s infiltration rate that is independent of the soil depth the depth of the soil layer on these underground car parks largely determines the amount of runoff in case the soils are not fully dried out or saturated before the rainfall event while substrates with a depth of 0 6 m in the business as usual scenario releases about 12 0 of the rainfall as outflow fig 14 the whole water volume is still stored when the substrates have a depth of 1 0 m fig 13 comparing with studies on green roof performance by mentens et al 2006 and lee et al 2015 this study shows a similar if not a better performance of stormwater measures the influence of the thickness of the soil substrate the initial water content and the precipitation height on the green roof s performance as stated by berndtsson 2010 is supported by the results of this study especially the rainfall intensity makes a strong impact on a green roof s storage and outflow volumes the installation of rain gardens lowers the volume of surface runoff and the sewer load and can contribute to groundwater recharge with a size of about 20 of the draining area the results show that this share is reasonable the performance of rain gardens is strongly influenced by the temperature muthanna et al 2008 moreover previous dry periods which correspond to the initial water content of the soil can affect the performance of a rain garden ibid the influence of the ambient temperature was not studied in this work the influence of the initial soil moisture however is clearly demonstrated the seasonal variability and the dependency of vegetation growth and soil compaction carpenter and hallam 2008 jiang et al 2017 could not be investigated in this work due to the decision to model single events pitt and voorhees 2011 observed a 90 percent annual reduction of sewer inflows in kansas city usa by the introduction of rain gardens with an annual precipitation height of approximately 1000 mm in kansas city national weather service n d it roughly corresponds to the annual rainfall in munich bayerisches landesamt für umwelt 2018 since this work modelled single events and no long time simulation a direct comparison is not possible however the results show that for current precipitation rainfalls up to a return period of ten years can be stored in the rain gardens therefore we suggest that an estimated retention of 90 annual precipitation can be assumed to be plausible for this study as well porous pavements offer a straightforward possibility to increase the infiltration of areas like footpaths or cycle tracks the efficiency of the porous pavement strongly depends on the infiltration rate f 1 of the surface layer this factor f 1 in pcswmm only depends on the precipitation and additional inflows and the water depth on the surface it is limited by the void fraction of the storage layer the moisture content of the pavement layer the pavement s thickness and the exfiltration rate of water from the storage layer into the native soil rossmann and huber 2016 overall the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the native soil beneath and the storage capacity of the porous pavement elements is assumed to be large enough to retain all inflow studies about the performance of porous pavement show that their long term performance is overall steady brattebo and booth 2003 in this study only the short term performance of porous pavements is evaluated the results indicate that all inflows are infiltrated in the underlying native soil or stored in the gravel storage layer underneath the porous top layer this demonstrates that the infiltration compared to standard asphalt is throughout higher as stated also by drake et al 2013 4 3 limitations of this study further impacts of increased infiltration capacity and decrease of runoff are important factors the resulting effects of nature based solutions on soils and groundwater recharge by increased infiltration are central moreover water stored by the various stormwater retention measures increases the rate of evapotranspiration and provides a cooling effect for buildings and the surroundings unep 2014 european commission 2013 however the study did not consider co benefits of stormwater measures such as temperature regulation from evapotranspiration rahman et al 2017 zölch et al 2016 nor did it assess seasonal influences on the performance of the sustainable stormwater management measures the temporal overlap of extreme precipitation events with different soil saturation conditions can potentially vary the performance of stormwater management measures the study is based on single event modelling which does not account for initial soil and porous surface saturation or the duration between precipitation events further the impact of climate change on cycles of soil saturation could not be considered in the single event approach and is therefore a limitation of this study in order to limit the scope of our approach the comparison between the different scenarios is based solely on the water balance i e infiltration runoff and storage and not on the temporal changes of the processes a more detailed consideration of material characteristics or the age of the measures was equally beyond the scope of this study the simulation of flood inundation areas water depth and flow velocities for extreme precipitation events can be better represented by coupled 1d 2d urban flood models the application of such approaches would likely lead to a more in depth understanding of the hydrological dynamics particularly concerning the flow exchange between surface runoff and sewer system however while overland flows over the terrain are better simulated by 1d 2d models they are also computationally more expensive and limit therefore the number of simulations feasible under deadline constrains leandro et al 2009 5 conclusion densification can reduce urban sprawl in growing cities the approach to densification should consider environmental impacts from the outset since densification can entail adverse environmental effects and thus reduce quality of life in the city if not planned wisely sustainable stormwater management measures need to be integrated into densification schemes however whether stormwater management measures can be installed depends on the overall built density of the area the results presented in this paper indicate that disconnected green roofs rain gardens and porous pavements are substantial nature based solutions to cope with an increasing intensity of heavy precipitation events due to climate change the results show about 38 of runoff reduction for the best case scenario compared to the business as usual scenario while increasing the living space about 8 more while the specific site factors of this study limit the generalizability of the results this approach nevertheless provides new insights into the impacts and opportunities of densifying neighbourhoods this study clearly demonstrates that the addition of storeys on already existing buildings in combination with stormwater management measures is preferable for this settlement type both in terms of increase of residential floor space as well as concerning the reduction of stormwater runoff and water balance improvement when compared to additional buildings whether storeys can be added depends on the specific bearing capacity of the existing buildings such calculations fall outside of the scope of this study a substrate thickness of 20 cm on the building roofs is necessary to store rainfall heights up to a ten year return period with respect to the increase of extreme events the installation of a minimum 20 cm thick green roof is advisable the share of runoff from green roofs on underground car parks is determined by the soil moisture conditions at the time of a rainfall event the installation of rain gardens with a size of about 20 of the draining area and porous pavements lower the volume of surface runoff and can contribute to groundwater recharge generally it is worth noticing that the results show a strong impact of the increase in precipitation intensities due to climate change on the performance of the stormwater management measures the projections for 2040 2068 demonstrate that the current situation and the implementation of more buildings without any compensation measures face severe problems in terms of stormwater management the same is valid for the best case scenario with various sustainable stormwater management measures implemented however the impact is in total still much lower compared to the results of the other two scenarios this indicates that the business as usual attitude of disregarding water sensitive design considerations is no longer suitable for this case study yet depending on the approach of densification the gain of living space can be combined with the enhancement of the water balance in residential areas this study based on a real planning case has shown that the implementation of nature based solutions is key to achieving this mutual gain further research could address the long term potential of nature based solutions to compensate densification under the impact of climate change the influence of climate change alters the return periods of precipitation events this increases the importance of including different moisture conditions as well as their temporal overlap with extreme precipitation events in future long term studies to investigate their influence on the performance of stormwater management measures furthermore future studies should investigate the measures capacity to lower air temperature on hot days via evapotranspiration besides coupled 1d 2d models can bring new insights into the effectiveness of stormwater management measures in terms of surface flow patterns and

4732,despite abundant research documenting that land use land cover lulc have substantial impacts on the hydrology of humid tropical systems field based evidence for the physical mechanisms behind these impacts are still lacking in particular our understanding of the hydrologic flowpaths that generate runoff in these systems and how they vary with respect to lulc is insufficient to inform both physically based hydrologic modeling and land use decision making in this study we use end member mixing analysis emma of stream chemistry and hydrometric characterizations of hillslope soil moisture to identify hydrologic flowpaths in humid tropical steep land catchments of varying lulc mature tropical forest young secondary tropical forest cattle pasture emma was applied to data from 14 storm events six at the mature forest five at the young secondary forest and three at the cattle pasture that were intensively sampled during the 2017 wet season representing a wide range of rainfall magnitudes and intensities additionally volumetric soil moisture responses at multiple depths were characterized during and after 74 storm events occurring from 2015 to 2017 emma results indicated that lateral preferential flow within the top 30 cm of the soil profile was a dominant source of runoff generation at the two forested catchments with the contribution of this flow path increasing with rainfall magnitude and intensity this was corroborated by volumetric soil moisture data that showed that a perched zone of saturation developed at 30 cm at the time of peak storm runoff during the largest events and lasted for the remaining duration of the event emma indicated that runoff was a combination of infiltration excess overland flow and lateral subsurface flow in the actively grazed pastoral catchment there overland flow contributed 62 of runoff during the highest runoff rate sampled 35 3 mm hr and this contribution increased substantially with storm magnitude this flowpath identification was also supported by volumetric soil moisture data at the pasture with peak saturation at all depths during the largest storm events occurring up to 30 min after peak runoff these results provide a mechanistic explanation for previously observed hydrologic differences among tropical lulcs additionally the wide range of hydrologic conditions during these storm events provide a basis for understanding how future changes to this and similar humid tropical regions will impact hydrological processes and water availability keywords humid tropics land cover disturbance hydrology flowpaths end member mixing 1 introduction while the humid tropics cover approximately one fifth of the global land surface and produce the greatest runoff of any biome hydrological processes in these regions are poorly understood in comparison to many temperate parts of the earth wohl et al 2012 in particular the mechanisms that govern runoff generation have rarely been distinguished in the field leading to insufficient data for quantitative modeling of future changes to water availability in the context of changing hydroclimate and land use land cover lulc wohl et al 2012 rainfall in the humid tropics while abundant is often highly seasonal with most or all falling during only a specific portion of the year the ability of a catchment to generate runoff throughout the year from seasonal rainfall is determined by the activation of hydrologic flowpaths during rainfall events the activation of these flowpaths depends on both the structure and transmissivity of the soil and the volume and intensity of incident precipitation ultimately active flowpaths determine whether rainfall is stored in the subsurface and released slowly as baseflow or transmitted quickly to streams as stormflow dubreuil 1985 elsenbeer 2001 mcglynn et al 2002 correa et al 2016 during rainfall events soils act as gatekeepers with infiltration rates hydraulic conductivity and macroporosity determining the rate and direction of water movement through a catchment correa et al 2016 in the humid tropics these key soil properties can change strongly following changes to lulc zimmermann et al 2006 hassler et al 2011 algeet abarquero et al 2015 the specific alterations to hydrologic flowpaths resulting from these changes to soil properties have not been distinguished at the catchment scale this is particularly true in one of the more common tropical lulc scenarios where primary forest is cleared for cattle pasture in this scenario macroporosity is greatly reduced by compaction and hydraulic conductivity in the upper soil layers can decrease by an order of magnitude germer et al 2010 hassler et al 2011 litt et al 2019 bush et al 2020 accompanying these impacts to soil properties can be a two fold increase in median peak runoff rates and a reduction in dry season baseflow when forests are converted to pasture bruijnzeel 1988 ogden et al 2013 guzha et al 2015 laxo et al 2019 cheng et al 2020 the observation of this phenomenon has produced the forest sponge effect hypothesis which proposes that in comparison to pasture lands tropical forests behave like sponges absorbing more wet season rainfall and releasing it more slowly during the dry season than deforested land covers ogden et al 2013 cheng et al 2020 while these observations provide a valuable framework a lack of description of the physical mechanisms underlying changes in seasonal storage and runoff with regard to lulc makes the parameterization other than through model calibration of predictive hydrological models difficult to impossible kirchner 2006 wohl et al 2012 source contributions to runoff from different flowpaths are frequently identified using two to three end member mixing models or through more complex end member mixing analysis emma sklash farvolden 1979 christopherson hooper 1992 trinh et al 2020 van meerveld et al 2019 the fundamental assumption behind this approach is that stream chemistry represents a quantifiable mixture of different water sources within a catchment each with its own distinct geochemical signature caused by the difference in residence time and exposure to reactive surfaces for these flowpaths these distinct geochemical signatures can be used to quantitatively separate the hydrograph by its contributing sources end members within the catchment however the corresponding flowpaths inferred from emma and hydrograph separation techniques often depend on antecedent moisture conditions and the rainfall characteristics of the storm event klaus mcdonnell 2013 laxo et al 2019 birch et al 2021 for example numerous studies have documented increased event new water contributions to stormflow in cases of decreased antecedent wetness marc et al 2001 blume et al 2008 pellerin et al 2008 the effects of rainfall intensity and volume are both spatially and temporally variable moore 1989 brown et al 1999 pellerin et al 2008 renshaw et al 2003 litt et al 2015 laxo et al 2019 birch et al 2021 studies that sample storms across a sufficient range of hydrologic conditions to account for this variability are limited particularly in remote tropical regions buttle mcdonnell 2004 klaus mcdonnell 2013 hydrograph separation studies in temperate regions have found that storm runoff in all but the largest storm events is typically dominated by old or pre event water water which was stored in the catchment prior to the subject rainfall event and often delivered to the stream through slow flowpaths acting on the scale of hours to months buttle 1994 fritz et al 1976 kienzler naef 2008 klaus mcdonnell 2013 sklash farvolden 1979 jones 1997 storm runoff in the humid tropics can be dominated by fast flowpaths such as preferential flow through macropores and overland flow which respond on the scale of minutes to hours birch et al 2021 chappell 2010 elsenbeer 2001 elsenbeer et al 1995 elsenbeer and lack 1996 gardner et al 2017 kinner and stallard 2004 stallard and murphy 2014 trinh et al 2020 jones 1997 walsh and howells 1988 the prevalence of these fast flowpaths in the humid tropics has been attributed to both larger rainfall inputs and intensities and different soil properties buttle mcdonnell 2004 chappell 2010 gardner et al 2017 van meerveld et al 2019 trinh et al 2020 birch et al 2021 specifically the high macroporosity of tropical forest soils due to the extensive rooting and bioturbation in the upper soil horizons 0 15 cm makes rapid shallow preferential flow a frequent contributor to storm runoff chappell 2010 cheng et al 2017 gardner et al 2017 kinner and stallard 2004 walsh and howells 1988 overland flow has also been observed in many humid tropical systems though the presence and importance of this flowpath varies geographically depending on soil type topography and lulc dubreuil 1985 elsenbeer et al 1995 elsenbeer 2001 algeet abarquero et al 2015 litt et al 2019 bush et al 2020 fast flowpaths often exhibit threshold behavior requiring specific storage conditions or rainfall intensities to be exceeded before becoming active and dramatically increasing the style magnitude and efficiency of runoff response lin zhou 2007 gomi et al 2008 graham et al 2010 nieber sidle 2010 fu et al 2013 as a result small changes in the magnitude and or intensity of storms or to antecedent moisture conditions can have a disproportionately large effect on the subsequent runoff behavior of tropical catchments noguchi et al 1997 mahmood vivoni 2011 esquivel hernandez et al 2017 scaife band 2017 lópez ramírez et al 2020 birch et al 2021 given 1 the existence and prevalence of threshold governed fast flowpaths in the humid tropics 2 the variability in flowpath networks and their dependence on antecedent conditions and 3 lulc dependent soil properties we suggest that flowpath identification in this region must incorporate a wide range of rain events and antecedent conditions and include catchments of multiple lulc types while a number of previous studies in the humid tropics have applied a mixing model or emma approach to flowpath identification with some success most lack a sample size or range of conditions during sampled storm events sufficient to characterize both hydrometric and lulc effects on the runoff response to better understand hydrologic flowpaths in humid tropical catchments in the context of future changes to both lulc and hydroclimate our study compares hydrologic flowpaths across a wide range of storm event magnitudes for three catchments mature tropical forest young secondary tropical forest and cattle pasture our conceptual model of the dominant factors that affect the runoff response and their interactions is outlined in fig 1 and it includes both variations in lulc as well as storm size and intensity because both of these variables are subject to rapid future change in parts of the humid tropics lambin 1997 sterling et al 2013 fabrega et al 2013 through geochemically based emma analysis we identify dominant hydrologic flowpaths during a total of 14 storm events six at the mature forest five at the young secondary forest and three at the cattle pasture during the 2017 wet season with peak runoff rates ranging across two orders of magnitude 0 14 to 40 9 mm hr and rainfall totals ranging from 5 6 mm to 60 6 mm additionally hillslope hydrometric data were used to characterize soil moisture conditions at multiple depths during an even broader range of events n 74 that occurred between 2015 and 2017 these characterizations were then used to corroborate emma results in the broader context of physical hydrologic processes within each catchment we used this combined hydrometric and geochemical approach to answer the following research questions 1 how do the dominant hydrologic flowpaths governing runoff generation differ in catchments across lulc and 2 how does the relative importance of these hydrologic flowpaths change over a range of antecedent conditions and rainfall magnitudes and intensities in addition to the identification of hydrologic flowpaths and their relative dominance across a wide range of hydrologic conditions and lulc our results provide valuable constraints that can be incorporated into physical hydrologic models to predict the impacts of future changes in both lulc and hydroclimate to water availability in similar humid tropical systems 2 methods 2 1 study site and instrumentation our study catchments are located within the agua salud watershed in central panama 9 12 60 n 79 44 55 w the agua salud watershed consists of a mosaic of small catchments of varying lulc and is part of a landscape scale research study initiated by the smithsonian tropical research institute stri to investigate lulc influences on ecosystem services stallard et al 2010 agua salud has wet and dry seasons driven by the annual migration of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz the wet season hydroclimate is characterized by high intensity convective thunderstorms and typically extends from early may until late december ten year mean rainfall at the site is 2657 mm yr paton 2018 elevation at agua salud ranges from 40 to 320 m above mean sea level with a tropical steepland terrane dominating the headwaters mean slope 30 hall et al 2015 the geology at the site is highly weathered basaltic and andesitic rock covered by up to 20 m of oxisols and inceptisols derived from in situ bedrock weathering these soils are highly weathered and well drained with infiltration rates highly variable depending on lulc hassler et al 2011 litt et al 2019 within the agua salud watershed we selected three study catchments 3 km apart ranging in size from 6 1 ha to 42 6 ha which are similar in slope mean slope 30 soils and geology but with contrasting vegetation cover and land use history table 1 fig 2 2 2 hydrometric data collection 2 2 1 streamflow and precipitation stream discharge was monitored and recorded every five minutes at the outlet of each of our study catchments using a combination of pressure sensors in situ leveltroll model 300 and 90 v notch concrete or steel weirs see ogden et al 2013 barometric data were used to create a custom pressure to discharge correction for each weir based on elevation differences between the weir and one of three barometric sensors the resulting discharge time series was then divided by the area of each catchment to yield a time series of runoff rates specific discharge in mm hr a tipping bucket precipitation gauge texas electronics tr 525 m measured precipitation in 0 254 mm increments every 5 min and was on a hilltop free of canopy cover on all sides fig 2 2 2 2 soil moisture soil moisture was recorded every 15 min decagon devices gs1 sensors at depths of 10 30 50 and 100 cm at three locations per catchment approximately 10 m apart along the planar hillslopes avoiding ridge crest and riparian zones calibration and data correction methodology for our volumetric water content vwc percent of total soil volume occupied by water measurements can be found in appendix a 1 following the onset of the wet season vwc was found to be minimally variable within 15 of the maximum at all depths and at all three catchments to account for this low variability in analysis and visualization vwc values were converted to relative percent saturation vwcrelative of instantaneous vwc value in comparison to the maximum vwc recorded by each sensor which we assumed to represent complete saturation of the soil matrix periods of sensor failure were not included in analysis 2 3 geochemical characterization 2 3 1 streamflow storm events were intensively sampled from may to august 2017 during the wet season samples were collected at the outlet of each catchment using automated samplers teledyne isco model 6712 programmed to begin collecting individual not composite samples every 15 60 min following an increase in stream stage large enough to be considered event driven polypropylene isco bottles were transported from the field to the laboratory where samples were filtered through combusted glass microfiber filters whatman glass microfiber filters grade gf f after filtration samples were stored in 60 ml brown plastic vials and frozen until analysis sample counts from individual events ranging from 5 to 20 samples depending on the programmed sampling interval at the time the event occurred and the length of the event a total of 14 storm events were sampled in this manner including six at the mat catchment five at the sec catchment and three at the pas catchment 2 3 2 hillslope end members composite samples from potential hillslope end members assumed to represent different shallow and surface hydrologic flowpaths were collected weekly and additionally following major storm events from july to august 2017 zero tension lysimeters 0 t were installed at depths of 10 30 and 50 cm at the top middle mid and bottom bot hillslope positions to capture preferential subsurface flow through the soil matrix difference infiltrometers moody ebel 2012 bush et al 2020 were used to collect composite overland flow samples and were installed at the top mid and bot hillslope positions at all three catchments throughfall was collected in the forested catchments by two parallel transects of six throughfall collectors installed along each hillslope in the forested catchments spanning from the ridgetop to the riparian zone throughfall collectors consisted of a 10 cm plastic funnel draining into a 1l brown plastic nalgene bottle all hillslope sampling instrumentation was emptied following each sampling event and rinsed with de ionized water prior to re deployment two to three groundwater wells installed at two to three meters below the soil surface in the riparian area of each catchment were sampled for riparian groundwater at each site visit roughly biweekly and rainfall was collected in an adjacent rainfall collector clear of canopy cover and debris in all directions end member samples were filtered and frozen until analysis 2 3 3 chemical analysis samples were thawed to sub sample for analysis and were then re frozen and stored at 32 c between analyses ion chromatography dionex aqioun ion chromatography system was used to analyze all samples for major cations ca2 na mg2 k and major anions cl so4 no3 duplicates were analyzed on 10 of those samples to quantify precision and known standards and analytical blanks were run during each analysis to verify accuracy mean accuracy for ion chromatography analysis was 2 5 from known values and precision for each analyzed solute based on analytical duplicates is given in table 2 of section 3 3 of results 2 4 hydrologic flowpath identification 2 4 1 hydrometric characterization volumetric moisture sensors were installed in may of 2015 but experienced frequent failures in order to characterize soil moisture conditions during storm events and allow for comparisons among catchments storms were selected from time periods 2015 2017 in each catchment where data were available at all four instrumented depths 10 30 50 and 100 cm this overlap most frequently occurred at the top hillslope position in each catchment and this position was subsequently used for analysis during periods where instrumentation was functioning at multiple hillslope positions fluctuations in vwcrelative were comparable among depths at various hillslope positions r2 ranging from 0 50 to 0 88 due to total equipment failure prior to 2017 in the pas catchment all storms used for characterization in this catchment were drawn from the 2015 wet season vwcrelative soil moisture profiles were used to assess the timing of saturation and connectivity at the various depths in each hillslope in relation to peak stormflow to characterize soil moisture conditions across a wide range of runoff event sizes storms were classified in each catchment based on the percentage of annual runoff generated at runoff rates below the peak runoff rate of each storm event stallard murphy 2014 this classification system was preferentially chosen over an exceedance probability derived classification system to better account for the contribution of a given class to total annual runoff generation rather than simply accounting for its frequency of occurrence using this classification system storms were separated into 0 50 50 75 75 90 and 90 100 event size classes once classified mean vwcrelative profiles and standard deviations of vwcrelative at each depth were calculated across all events in each storm class in 15 minute intervals from the period of 2 h before to 3 5 h after peak storm runoff this 5 5 h time window was selected based on observational data to capture as fully as possible 1 typical antecedent moisture conditions 2 soil moisture response to rainfall 3 soil moisture conditions during the runoff event and 4 soil moisture conditions during recession to pre event flow conditions while accounting for variability in storm duration and rainfall intensity 2 4 2 end member mixing analysis emma end member mixing analysis was done on all collected stream samples at each catchment following the methods of christopherson and hooper 1992 each solute considered for tracer selection was standardized by subtracting the mean concentration of that solute for a given water source and location and dividing by the standard deviation the standardized stream chemistry dataset for each stream was then examined using principal component analysis pca in the r 3 5 0 statistical programming language r core team 2018 mean end member concentrations were then volume weighted to better represent total flux then projected into principal component space using the eigenvectors from the stream chemistry principal component analysis pca stream and riparian groundwater samples were not weighted by flow nor volume after projection of stream samples standardized solute concentrations of potential hillslope end members were also projected into principal component space for visual inspection of each potential mixing scenario end member mixing analysis as described above was done on the stream solute dataset for each catchment using each possible combination of the solutes which were consistently found at detectable levels in streamflow cl no3 so4 2 mg2 ca2 na and k significant outliers from each of these datasets 5 8 of total samples were defined as any data point more than two standard deviations above or below the mean of the data and were removed before emma analysis this removal was done to prevent significant outliers resulting from geochemical anomalies or analytical errors from having a disproportionate influence on the results of pca end member mixing scenarios and tracer selections were based on criteria adapted from christopherson and hooper 1992 while also incorporating the results of our hydrometric characterizations as described below criteria for tracer selection 1 ability to distinguish between end members end members were required to occupy distinct regions in principal component space with minimal overlap 2 generation of a realistic mixing scenario stream chemistry must occupy the mixing space generated by end members such that the maximum number of projected stream samples can be described as a mixture of two or more end members 3 apparent conservative behavior of tracers on the scale of individual storm events bivariate scatter plots of solutes selected do not co vary in an apparent non linear fashion which would indicate non conservative mixing uptake or release 4 maximization of the percent of variance in each stream dataset explained by the first two principal components pc1 pc2 criteria for end member selection 1 the number of end members to be used in each catchment was calculated following the rule of one where 1 nth of the variation in stream chemistry must be explained by the last principal component retained with n equal to the number of tracers used 2 end members were selected based upon their ability to effectively explain variation in stream chemistry such that all or most stream samples can be represented as a mixture of two or more end members 3 agreement with hydrometric data such that hillslope end members which do not appear hydrologically connected to the stream based on hydrometric data do not contribute to runoff generation after selection of end member and tracer datasets for each catchment following the above criteria hydrograph separations were done on each stream solute dataset using the standard simultaneous equations for two equations 1 2 and three equations 3 5 end member mixing models with principal components one and two as tracers 1 f 1 pc stream 1 pc 1 1 pc 2 1 pc 1 1 2 f 2 1 f 1 3 f 1 pc stream 1 pc 3 1 pc 2 2 pc 3 2 p c 2 1 pc 3 1 pc stream 2 pc 3 2 pc 1 1 pc 3 1 pc 2 2 pc 3 2 pc 2 1 pc 3 1 pc 1 2 pc 3 2 4 f 2 pc stream 1 pc 3 1 pc 2 1 pc 3 1 pc 1 1 pc 3 1 p c 2 1 pc 3 1 f 1 5 f 3 1 f 1 f 2 where fx is the fractional contribution of end member x to streamflow and p c x i is principal component i of end member x after separating the hydrograph for each catchment runoff fractions were converted to runoff rates contributed by each end member by multiplying each fraction by the instantaneous runoff rate at the time of sampling results of each end member mixing scenario were tested based on their ability to reproduce original stream solute values by multiplying hydrograph separation results end member fractions by the original mean end member solute concentrations mixing model fitness was quantified using simple linear regression between observed and back calculated stream solute concentrations with mixing model fitness as the coefficient of determination r2 between original and reproduced stream solute values 3 results 3 1 rainfall and runoff runoff rate exhibited a flashy response to rainfall events at all three catchments with runoff peaks typically occurring within 60 min of peak rainfall and receding within several hours peak runoff rates observed at the pas catchment far exceeded those at the mat and sec catchments fig 3 peak runoff rates observed during the intensive sampling period were 40 9 mm hr at the pas 15 1 mm hr at the sec and 12 7 mm hr at the mat fig 3 maximum daily rainfall during the intensive sampling period was 63 7 mm and during the overall 2017 wet season was 80 1 mm and occurred on october 22nd the total volume of water collected in 0 t lysimeters was greater by nearly an order of magnitude at the forested catchments then at the pas over the course of the intensive sampling period 200 mm of total water was collected in the six 0 t lysimeters at both the sec 248 mm and mat 230 mm catchments while only 40 mm total was collected at the pas large 10 mm increases in cumulative zero tension lysimeter collection at the sec and mat catchments occurred on the scale on single storm events while at the pas increases in zero tension lysimeter collection were gradual and showed little response to rainfall events fig s 2 3 2 soil moisture and runoff response variability in vwcrelative across a range of flow conditions generally decreased with depth with vwcrelative at 100 cm in all three catchments remaining within 10 of the maximum for the duration of the record at the mat and sec catchments runoff rate exhibited a non linear threshold relationship to vwcrelative at all four instrumented depths fig 4 this threshold behavior was most pronounced at the mat catchment the largest runoff rates observed at the mat and sec catchments occurred only when vwcrelative at all instrumented depths was within 5 of maximum relative saturation fig 4 at the pas catchment runoff rate was not clearly related to vwcrelative with the highest runoff rates occurring independent of and across a wide range of soil moisture conditions fig 4 during the highest runoff rate observed for which soil moisture data at the pas were available 71 4 mm hr vwcrelative at 10 cm depth was only 76 9 all storms used for characterization of the mat and sec catchments occurred during 2017 and were concurrent with the wet season period during which intensive storm sampling was undertaken 3 2 1 antecedent conditions for all three catchments vwcrelative was most variable at 10 cm vwcrelative at the 30 50 and 100 cm depth remained within 10 of the maximum for all storms for which there were data highlighting the low variability in antecedent wetness conditions in the deeper portions of the soil profile fig 5 this minimal variability is perhaps due to the high frequency of rainfall events occurring during the wet season rainfall was recorded on 69 of days from may to november 2017 seasonal variations in soil moisture were the largest at 10 cm 25 with deeper depths approaching the maximum at the onset of the wet season and remaining within 10 throughout soil moisture variations during events of similar size were similar regardless of the antecedent hydrologic conditions at the time during the wet season in which they occurred indicating little influence of antecedent conditions on the subsurface storm response fig 5 3 2 2 mature forest mat at the mat site the smallest runoff events 0 0 24 mm hr produced an increase in vwcrelative in only the top 10 cm of the soil and did not reach 100 relative saturation vwcrelative in deeper layers showed no response to precipitation fig 5 during storms of the 75 90 percent classification range 0 24 2 85 mm hr vwcrelative in the top 10 cm depth showed a greater response to precipitation than during smaller events notably during storms in the 75 90 percentile peak flow range vwcrelative at 30 cm depth reached near 100 for nearly all events with little variability at this depth only during the largest runoff events in the 90 100 percent classification range 2 85 mm hr did saturated or near saturated conditions occur at all soil depths during the largest events vwcrelative at both 30 cm and 50 cm peaked at the time of peak runoff and peak vwcrelative at 10 cm preceded peak runoff by 15 min 3 2 3 young secondary forest sec at the sec catchment antecedent soil moisture conditions were typically lower and more variable than at the mat during storm events soil moisture conditions at the sec behaved in a similar manner to the mat with the 30 cm depth approaching relative saturation during mid sized events and the lower depths only approaching saturation during the largest runoff events during the largest runoff events at the sec peak wetness occurred simultaneously with peak runoff at the 30 50 and 100 cm depths and approximately 15 min prior to peak runoff at 10 cm 3 2 4 cattle pasture pas vwcrelative in the top 10 cm at the pas showed little response to rainfall in events producing peak runoff rates less than 0 38 mm hr at this depth vwcrelative increased with increasing event size with storms below the 90 classification producing peak vwcrelative at 10 cm at the time of peak runoff fig 5 notably at the 50 100 cm depths there was minimal variability in comparison with the forested catchments and antecedent moisture conditions at these depths remained at or near maximum vwcrelative during and prior to events of all sizes during the largest runoff events 100 classification the pas produced nearly an order of magnitude greater peak runoff rates than events of a comparable class at the mat and sec during these events soil moisture response at all depths was delayed with peak vwcrelative occurring 30 min after the peak runoff rate 3 3 stream and potential end member geochemistry overland flow zero tension soil water and throughfall samples generally had higher volume weighted mean concentrations of biologically active solutes k no3 so4 2 in comparison to mean streamflow concentrations although concentrations were variable among all depths and catchments table 2 k in particular was higher in overland flow throughfall and zero tension soil water at both forested sites while at the pas k in zero tension soil water at all depths 1 2 1 4 mg l were comparable to streamflow 1 37 mg l but concentrations in overland flow were twice 2 54 mg l as high as other near surface end members in mat and sec so4 2 in zero tension soil water increased with depth this stratification was not observed at the pas where so4 2 in soil water was greater 1 8 1 9 mg l than mean streamflow 1 5 mg l but did not vary with depth table 2 volume weighted mean concentrations of primarily bedrock derived solutes mg2 ca2 na were substantially lower than both riparian groundwater and mean streamflow across all three catchments table 2 cl is primarily atmospherically derived but exhibits only minimal biological activity and followed the same trend as the primarily bedrock derived solutes cl in mean streamflow and riparian groundwater 3 9 13 mg l was greater than in near surface end members where cl was highly variable solute concentrations in riparian groundwater samples were generally comparable between catchments with the exception of cl which was elevated in both the mat and sec and so4 2 which was elevated at the pas relationships between primarily bedrock derived solutes were consistently linear across catchments except for mg and ca at the mat for which there was a high degree of scatter in the data fig 6 relationships between the biologically active solutes and bedrock derived solutes were more variable and differed in some instances among catchments k concentrations were inversely linear related with mg at the mat and sec catchments indicating conservative mixing between these two solutes fig 6 at the pas this relationship was less pronounced though at the highest runoff rate sampled during the study period in stream k was at its highest observed no3 exhibited a negative linear relationship with mg at the mat catchment that was not observed at either of the other catchments so4 2 was inversely related to mg at all three catchments though numerous outliers were observed throughout generally riparian groundwater did not resemble stream chemistry collected during low flow periods riparian groundwater was characterized by consistently higher concentrations of na mg so4 2 and ca than were observed in streamflow in each catchment indicating that this riparian groundwater is not likely a primary source of baseflow table 2 fig 6 k and mg proved useful in distinguishing among end members at all three catchments with high and variable k in near surface end members and constantly high mg during low flow periods optimal end member mixing scenarios for each catchment maximum variance explained by the first two principal components and their respective tracer combinations are shown in fig 7 at both the mat and sec catchments two end member mixing scenarios were suggested by the rule of one while at the pas a three end member scenario was required as riparian groundwater was not geochemically representative of low flow stream chemistry the most chemically extreme low flow stream sample from each catchment was assumed to represent the chemistry of the baseflow end member the most chemically extreme low flow sample was selected in favor of the lowest flow sample to 1 meet the assumptions of a two tracer three end member mixing model that all stream samples be bound by the selected end members and 2 because the runoff rate during baseflow increased by nearly an order of magnitude over the course of the study period fig 3 in all three catchments this would mean that the lowest flow sample collected during the study period would simply be the first low flow sample collected in may which would not necessarily be any more representative of baseflow chemistry when projected into principal component space stream samples at both the mat and sec catchment were best explained by a mixture of baseflow stream chemistry and zero tension soil water at the 30 cm depth fig 7 at the mat catchment these mixing scenarios agree with the hydrometric data fig 5 as during storm events in the 75 100 classification relative saturation occurred at 30 cm depth during and persisted the longest following peak runoff although saturated conditions at 30 cm only occurred at the sec catchment during the largest events 90 100 classification the two samples taken at highest storm flow are nearly identical in principal component space to zero tension soil water at 30 cm fig 7 at the pasture nearly all samples were bound by a mixture of baseflow zero tension soil water at varying depths and overland flow the overland flow end member exerted the greatest influence on stream chemistry at the highest runoff rate sampled fig 7 because the chemistry of zero tension soil water at the pas catchment varied little with depth zero tension soil water at 30 cm was selected as the third end member based on vwcrelative measurements showing dynamic behavior at this depth during storm events at the mat and sec catchments smaller runoff events events m1 s1 s2 were dominated by baseflow with the contribution from 30 cm soil water increasing with events size fig 8 a b during the largest events sampled at these catchments 30 cm soil water dominates runoff events m5 m6 s5 during the highest runoff rates sampled at the mat 2 75 mm hr during event m6 and sec 8 28 mm hr during event s5 catchments contribution of 30 cm soil water to runoff were 89 and 88 respectively at the pas catchment both of the smaller events sampled p1 p2 were dominated by baseflow with only marginal contributions from the 30 cm soil water and little to no overland flow fig 8c during the largest event sampled at the pas overland flow dominated runoff generation and contributed a maximum of 62 during the highest runoff rate sampled 35 3 mm hr total runoff and 22 mm hr overland flow during event p3 this would indicate the occurrence of widespread overland flow in the catchment as during event p3 40 9 mm of rainfall occurred with a maximum intensity of 12 2 mm hr during the entire 2017 wet season the average total rainfall for individual storm events at agua salud was 12 mm with an average maximum intensity of 9 mm hr based on these metrics storm p3 produced an above average rainfall total and maximum rainfall intensity the lack of sampled events between the storm size classes at the pas prevents us from commenting on the dominant flow pathways during intermediate events see fig s 1 for a full accounting of the characteristics of the intensively sampled storm events in the context of the entire 2017 water year 3 4 emma diagnostics r2 values between observed and back calculated stream solute concentrations were generally strong r2 0 58 to 0 93 and y intercepts were near zero indicating that the mixing models for each catchment are effective at re producing trends in stream chemistry slopes ranged from 0 74 to 1 28 indicating that the models may lead to some over or under prediction of the observed concentrations of certain solutes table 3 however slopes overall were close to one indicating that the mixing models and end members used are reasonably effective predictors of stream chemistry the r2 values between observed and back calculated stream solute concentrations were weakest at the pas catchment for so4 2 and k this weakness is likely due to the increased scatter in stream samples for these solutes at the pas which is outlined in fig 6 and may indicate an un characterized end member or some small degree of non conservative behavior of these solutes at this catchment 4 discussion 4 1 differences in hydrologic flowpaths across lulc the results of both emma and our soil moisture characterizations indicate that at the mat and sec catchments preferential flow through shallow soil horizons 30 cm is the dominant source of runoff generation during larger runoff events while pre event baseflow dominates smaller events this finding is consistent with previous studies in central panama and in the tropics writ large which have found higher macroporosity and abundant vertical and lateral preferential flowpaths in forests walsh howells 1988 chappell 2010 kinner and stallard 2004 cheng et al 2017 gardner et al 2017 our findings at the mat and sec catchments are also consistent with the rainfall simulation experiments conducted at agua salud by litt et al 2019 showing greater and deeper vertical transport in forest peak runoff rates during storms at both the mat and sec catchments were substantially lower than at the pas catchment while 0 t lysimeter collection was an order of magnitude higher this increased vertical percolation in mat is apparent in fig 5 where during the largest storm events the deeper soil horizons 30 100 cm at the sec and mat catchments reach near peak vwcrelative concurrent with peak storm runoff contrarily at the pas catchment the wetting of deeper soil horizons occurred substantially later 30 min during the largest runoff events indicating comparably lower vertical percolation in pas although based on only two 15 min measurement intervals during the largest runoff events evidence for the dominance of infiltration excess overland flow at the pas catchment was prevalent during the largest storm events peak runoff occurred 30 min prior to peak vwcrelative in the subsurface indicating that during these largest events peak runoff occurred independently of subsurface wetness conditions fig 5 while most samples collected fell on a geochemical spectrum between 0 t soil water and baseflow during the highest runoff rate sampled at the pas 35 3 mm hr runoff chemistry most closely resembled the geochemical characterization of overland flow the calculated overland flow fraction of runoff was 62 fig 7 fig 8 the occurrence of this infiltration excess overland flow is supported by previous plot scale observations litt et al 2019 bush et al 2020 and our findings indicate that this flowpath is a major contributor to storm runoff at pas this finding is also consistent with a number of studies in similar humid tropical regions where the occurrence of direct runoff via infiltration excess overland flow increased after the conversion of forested land to pasture muñoz villers mcdonnell 2013 algeet abarquero et al 2015 guzha et al 2015 differences between hydrologic flowpaths and vertical transmissivity between the forested sec mat and pastoral pas catchments are in line with the previously observed forest sponge effect and with other studies in the humid tropics which have identified these differences muñoz villers mcdonnell 2013 guzha et al 2015 while the preferential flowpath networks at the mat and sec catchments resulted in high contributions of soil water from 30 cm via preferential flow pathways during larger events these networks could also allow for greater vertical connectivity and higher rates of groundwater recharge previous modeling efforts at agua salud have required the inclusion of a deep vertical preferential flow network to accurately reproduce groundwater recharge and subsequent baseflow runoff rates cheng et al 2017 our vwcrelative results suggest that this deeper flowpath network may only become active during large events when deeper soil layers approach saturation this greater recharge may allow for the higher dry season baseflow and smaller wet season peak runoff rates observed in mat in contrast excess rainfall during large events at the pas is translated into infiltration excess overland flow bypassing storage and resulting in lower groundwater recharge and greater wet season peak runoff rates once the pasture soil is fully wet it drains slowly due to the lack of macropores streamflow at the mat catchment exhibited elevated mg2 na and ca2 in comparison to the other two catchments suggesting a minor difference in bedrock chemistry additionally the pas catchment 42 6 ha was substantially larger than both the mat and sec catchments while both of these factors may have some influence on runoff generating mechanisms we believe that the degree of difference in flowpath importance and function between them is primarily a function of land cover and land use history 4 2 variation in hydrologic flowpaths with storm characteristics and antecedent conditions results of our emma based hydrograph separations varied substantially in each catchment across the range of event magnitudes and intensities sampled highlighting the importance of sample size in flowpath identification studies during progressively larger rainfall events the fraction and magnitude of the 30 cm soil water component became greater at the mat and sec and during the two largest runoff events sampled this flowpath dominated runoff generation the variability in flowpath activation derived from our hydrograph separations in combination with a threshold response to soil moisture conditions implies a preferential flowpath network in the upper soil layer which only becomes active once certain wetness or rainfall intensity conditions have been met once active this network allows for the fast transmission of water from the hillslope to the stream producing the progressively higher runoff efficiencies with increasing event rainfall ogden et al 2013 at the pas hydrograph separation results varied widely among the three events sampled with the overland flow end member dominating only during the largest event sampled during the largest storm events soil moisture response to rainfall occurred 30 min after peak runoff runoff rates were frequently above 10 mm hr across a wide range of wetness conditions because runoff response during storm p3 at the pas occurred prior to an increase subsurface wetness conditions this would imply that the activation of overland flow depends on rainfall intensity rather than rainfall volume fig 8 this is supported by plot scale experiments where overland flow has been observed prior to the saturation of the upper soil matrix litt et al 2019 bush et al 2020 the activation of this infiltration excess overland flow path at high rainfall intensities explains the large event water contributions observed in large high intensity storm events by birch et al 2021 and the comparatively high runoff efficiencies reported by ogden et al 2013 for this catchment while a number of other studies have observed the occurrence of overland flow following the conversion of tropical forest to pasture the frequency of occurrence and its overall hydrologic importance has varied muñoz villers mcdonnell 2013 algeet abarquero et al 2015 guzha et al 2015 as the rainfall volume and intensity during storm p3 at the pas were not particularly high relative to the 2017 water year it is likely that overland flow is a frequent occurrence at the pas during moderately large events in studies conducted in other tropical regions flowpath activation and runoff response have shown varying degrees of sensitivity to both rainfall characteristics and antecedent moisture conditions while our analysis showed little sensitivity in runoff response to antecedent moisture conditions which showed limited variability during the wet season other studies in the tropics have found runoff response in a variety of land covers to increase in magnitude with increased antecedent wetness noguchi et al 1997 muñoz villers mcdonnell 2013 the apparent independence of runoff response to antecedent conditions in our catchments may be due to the high frequency of rainfall events at agua salud one every 2 3 days averaging 12 mm day during the wet season and the minimal variation in soil moisture conditions following the wet up at the onset of the wet season this may also be an effect of only sampling storm events following the onset of the wet season after which soil moisture conditions remained consistently wet litt et al 2015 suggested that events occurring early in the wet season may produce differing runoff responses than those occurring later though we were not able to observe this effect 4 3 implications for future environmental change and modeling future changes to hydroclimate such as increased storm magnitude and intensity karmalker and bradley nakayama et al 2012 fabrega et al 2013 and timing and duration of the wet season hidalgo et al 2013 are likely to have disproportionate non linear effects on the water balance of agua salud and similar humid tropical systems in the forested catchments mat sec our results suggest that more intense and larger storm events would increase the fraction of runoff contributed by subsurface preferential flow although this has the potential to increase both runoff efficiency and wet season groundwater recharge the well developed preferential flow network and high infiltration rates in mat make it likely that seasonal storage is less sensitive to changes in hydroclimate even during the largest events runoff efficiency in mat is relatively low in comparison to pasture ogden et al 2013 at the pas catchment overland flow only contributed marginally to runoff during two smaller events while dominating the largest event sampled as such future increases to storm size and intensity would likely make the occurrence of overland flow and the resulting increase in runoff efficiency in pasture more common the more frequent activation of overland flow in pasture as a result of increasing storm magnitude or intensity could increase disparities in runoff between forested and pasture as this would produce even greater losses of rainfall during wet season storm events from pasture which otherwise would have gone into the storage needed to maintain dry season baseflow the presence and activation of preferential flowpaths clearly plays a major role in both the lateral runoff generation and vertical groundwater recharge movement of water at the mat and sec catchments weiler mcdonnell 2007 shields tague 2012 litt et al 2019 these results provide observational support to the modeling study conducted at the sec catchment by cheng et al 2017 where a model structure incorporating both lateral and vertical preferential flow was necessary to accurately reproduce streamflow as such any further future efforts to model this system and similar systems in humid tropical regions must account for the presence and importance of this preferential flow occurring between 10 and 30 cm below the soil surface likewise at the pas catchment our results and those of studies previously conducted in the agua salud watershed indicate that infiltration excess overland flow while spatially limited and only occurring during large storms plays a major role in how rainfall is partitioned between streamflow and storage as such future modeling efforts should incorporate this flowpath to fully account for future changes to the flux of water through such systems 4 4 limitations of this study as with all studies utilizing emma for flowpath identification our results are limited by our degree of success in accurately characterizing the geochemistry of all potential end members and the conservative behavior of the tracers used burns et al 2001 a sampling of a groundwater source which was more representative of baseflow chemistry would have avoided the need to use streamflow itself as an end member and increased the robustness of our emma analysis this lack of a fully characterized groundwater end member may also indicate a missing end member in the three component hydrograph separation at the pas catchment which if identified could increase the robustness of our results although end member chemistry showed occasionally high degrees of variability the use of volume weighted means of these end members in combination were successful in reproducing observed fluctuations in stream chemistry table 3 assuming that tracer behavior is conservative on the scale of individual storm events this indicates that the hydrologic flowpath networks identified in this study can accurately describe the runoff responses observed in each catchment in a semi quantitative way with some degree of inherent uncertainty tracers used for each emma model were screened for non conservative behavior and bivariate solute plots revealed largely linear relationships between them at the mat and sec catchments p 0 05 r2 ranging from 0 18 to 0 66 for simple linear regressions our sample size of storm events was lowest at the pas catchment n 3 and bivariate solute plots showed weaker linear relationships p 0 05 r2 ranging from 0 06 to 0 50 for simple linear regressions between the tracers used suggesting the possibility of some non conservative behavior despite this uncertainty we believe our flowpath identifications at this catchment are accurate based on agreement with hillslope hydrometric data fig 5 and supportive results from previous studies at the site the use of additional tracers like doc may have added some benefit to more discretely distinguishing between potential end members however by informing our emma analysis and ensuring agreement with physical hydrometric measurements from each hillslope we have strengthened our results by accounting for the discrepancies reported in previous studies between tracer based hydrograph separation results and physical hillslope measurements sklash et al 1986 hangen et al 2001 klaus mcdonnell 2013 additionally the minor differences in geology observed at the mat catchment and differences in size between our study catchments may lead to some additional uncertainty as these factors can affect mechanisms of runoff generation however given the magnitude of the observed differences between the catchments we are confident that differences in hydrologic flowpaths and runoff generation between them can be primarily attributed to land cover 5 conclusions we identified hydrologic flowpaths across three humid tropical catchments mature tropical forest young secondary tropical forest and cattle pasture to determine how these vary with respect to lulc antecedent moisture conditions and rainfall characteristics using a combined approach of geochemical end member mixing and hillslope hydrometric characterizations our results indicate that both lulc and rainfall characteristics influenced the presence and activation of hydrologic flowpaths in each catchment in all three catchments pre event baseflow dominated runoff during smaller less intense events with the relative contributions of fast flowpaths becoming increasingly dominant with increasing event size at the two forested catchments preferential flow within the top 30 cm of the soil column dominated runoff generation during the largest events sampled while at a pastoral catchment infiltration excess overland flow became active and dominated the hydrograph during the largest sampled event our results provide evidence for the mechanisms behind the forest sponge effect previously observed in some humid tropical systems this effect may intensify with future changes to hydroclimate credit authorship contribution statement andrew l birch

4732,despite abundant research documenting that land use land cover lulc have substantial impacts on the hydrology of humid tropical systems field based evidence for the physical mechanisms behind these impacts are still lacking in particular our understanding of the hydrologic flowpaths that generate runoff in these systems and how they vary with respect to lulc is insufficient to inform both physically based hydrologic modeling and land use decision making in this study we use end member mixing analysis emma of stream chemistry and hydrometric characterizations of hillslope soil moisture to identify hydrologic flowpaths in humid tropical steep land catchments of varying lulc mature tropical forest young secondary tropical forest cattle pasture emma was applied to data from 14 storm events six at the mature forest five at the young secondary forest and three at the cattle pasture that were intensively sampled during the 2017 wet season representing a wide range of rainfall magnitudes and intensities additionally volumetric soil moisture responses at multiple depths were characterized during and after 74 storm events occurring from 2015 to 2017 emma results indicated that lateral preferential flow within the top 30 cm of the soil profile was a dominant source of runoff generation at the two forested catchments with the contribution of this flow path increasing with rainfall magnitude and intensity this was corroborated by volumetric soil moisture data that showed that a perched zone of saturation developed at 30 cm at the time of peak storm runoff during the largest events and lasted for the remaining duration of the event emma indicated that runoff was a combination of infiltration excess overland flow and lateral subsurface flow in the actively grazed pastoral catchment there overland flow contributed 62 of runoff during the highest runoff rate sampled 35 3 mm hr and this contribution increased substantially with storm magnitude this flowpath identification was also supported by volumetric soil moisture data at the pasture with peak saturation at all depths during the largest storm events occurring up to 30 min after peak runoff these results provide a mechanistic explanation for previously observed hydrologic differences among tropical lulcs additionally the wide range of hydrologic conditions during these storm events provide a basis for understanding how future changes to this and similar humid tropical regions will impact hydrological processes and water availability keywords humid tropics land cover disturbance hydrology flowpaths end member mixing 1 introduction while the humid tropics cover approximately one fifth of the global land surface and produce the greatest runoff of any biome hydrological processes in these regions are poorly understood in comparison to many temperate parts of the earth wohl et al 2012 in particular the mechanisms that govern runoff generation have rarely been distinguished in the field leading to insufficient data for quantitative modeling of future changes to water availability in the context of changing hydroclimate and land use land cover lulc wohl et al 2012 rainfall in the humid tropics while abundant is often highly seasonal with most or all falling during only a specific portion of the year the ability of a catchment to generate runoff throughout the year from seasonal rainfall is determined by the activation of hydrologic flowpaths during rainfall events the activation of these flowpaths depends on both the structure and transmissivity of the soil and the volume and intensity of incident precipitation ultimately active flowpaths determine whether rainfall is stored in the subsurface and released slowly as baseflow or transmitted quickly to streams as stormflow dubreuil 1985 elsenbeer 2001 mcglynn et al 2002 correa et al 2016 during rainfall events soils act as gatekeepers with infiltration rates hydraulic conductivity and macroporosity determining the rate and direction of water movement through a catchment correa et al 2016 in the humid tropics these key soil properties can change strongly following changes to lulc zimmermann et al 2006 hassler et al 2011 algeet abarquero et al 2015 the specific alterations to hydrologic flowpaths resulting from these changes to soil properties have not been distinguished at the catchment scale this is particularly true in one of the more common tropical lulc scenarios where primary forest is cleared for cattle pasture in this scenario macroporosity is greatly reduced by compaction and hydraulic conductivity in the upper soil layers can decrease by an order of magnitude germer et al 2010 hassler et al 2011 litt et al 2019 bush et al 2020 accompanying these impacts to soil properties can be a two fold increase in median peak runoff rates and a reduction in dry season baseflow when forests are converted to pasture bruijnzeel 1988 ogden et al 2013 guzha et al 2015 laxo et al 2019 cheng et al 2020 the observation of this phenomenon has produced the forest sponge effect hypothesis which proposes that in comparison to pasture lands tropical forests behave like sponges absorbing more wet season rainfall and releasing it more slowly during the dry season than deforested land covers ogden et al 2013 cheng et al 2020 while these observations provide a valuable framework a lack of description of the physical mechanisms underlying changes in seasonal storage and runoff with regard to lulc makes the parameterization other than through model calibration of predictive hydrological models difficult to impossible kirchner 2006 wohl et al 2012 source contributions to runoff from different flowpaths are frequently identified using two to three end member mixing models or through more complex end member mixing analysis emma sklash farvolden 1979 christopherson hooper 1992 trinh et al 2020 van meerveld et al 2019 the fundamental assumption behind this approach is that stream chemistry represents a quantifiable mixture of different water sources within a catchment each with its own distinct geochemical signature caused by the difference in residence time and exposure to reactive surfaces for these flowpaths these distinct geochemical signatures can be used to quantitatively separate the hydrograph by its contributing sources end members within the catchment however the corresponding flowpaths inferred from emma and hydrograph separation techniques often depend on antecedent moisture conditions and the rainfall characteristics of the storm event klaus mcdonnell 2013 laxo et al 2019 birch et al 2021 for example numerous studies have documented increased event new water contributions to stormflow in cases of decreased antecedent wetness marc et al 2001 blume et al 2008 pellerin et al 2008 the effects of rainfall intensity and volume are both spatially and temporally variable moore 1989 brown et al 1999 pellerin et al 2008 renshaw et al 2003 litt et al 2015 laxo et al 2019 birch et al 2021 studies that sample storms across a sufficient range of hydrologic conditions to account for this variability are limited particularly in remote tropical regions buttle mcdonnell 2004 klaus mcdonnell 2013 hydrograph separation studies in temperate regions have found that storm runoff in all but the largest storm events is typically dominated by old or pre event water water which was stored in the catchment prior to the subject rainfall event and often delivered to the stream through slow flowpaths acting on the scale of hours to months buttle 1994 fritz et al 1976 kienzler naef 2008 klaus mcdonnell 2013 sklash farvolden 1979 jones 1997 storm runoff in the humid tropics can be dominated by fast flowpaths such as preferential flow through macropores and overland flow which respond on the scale of minutes to hours birch et al 2021 chappell 2010 elsenbeer 2001 elsenbeer et al 1995 elsenbeer and lack 1996 gardner et al 2017 kinner and stallard 2004 stallard and murphy 2014 trinh et al 2020 jones 1997 walsh and howells 1988 the prevalence of these fast flowpaths in the humid tropics has been attributed to both larger rainfall inputs and intensities and different soil properties buttle mcdonnell 2004 chappell 2010 gardner et al 2017 van meerveld et al 2019 trinh et al 2020 birch et al 2021 specifically the high macroporosity of tropical forest soils due to the extensive rooting and bioturbation in the upper soil horizons 0 15 cm makes rapid shallow preferential flow a frequent contributor to storm runoff chappell 2010 cheng et al 2017 gardner et al 2017 kinner and stallard 2004 walsh and howells 1988 overland flow has also been observed in many humid tropical systems though the presence and importance of this flowpath varies geographically depending on soil type topography and lulc dubreuil 1985 elsenbeer et al 1995 elsenbeer 2001 algeet abarquero et al 2015 litt et al 2019 bush et al 2020 fast flowpaths often exhibit threshold behavior requiring specific storage conditions or rainfall intensities to be exceeded before becoming active and dramatically increasing the style magnitude and efficiency of runoff response lin zhou 2007 gomi et al 2008 graham et al 2010 nieber sidle 2010 fu et al 2013 as a result small changes in the magnitude and or intensity of storms or to antecedent moisture conditions can have a disproportionately large effect on the subsequent runoff behavior of tropical catchments noguchi et al 1997 mahmood vivoni 2011 esquivel hernandez et al 2017 scaife band 2017 lópez ramírez et al 2020 birch et al 2021 given 1 the existence and prevalence of threshold governed fast flowpaths in the humid tropics 2 the variability in flowpath networks and their dependence on antecedent conditions and 3 lulc dependent soil properties we suggest that flowpath identification in this region must incorporate a wide range of rain events and antecedent conditions and include catchments of multiple lulc types while a number of previous studies in the humid tropics have applied a mixing model or emma approach to flowpath identification with some success most lack a sample size or range of conditions during sampled storm events sufficient to characterize both hydrometric and lulc effects on the runoff response to better understand hydrologic flowpaths in humid tropical catchments in the context of future changes to both lulc and hydroclimate our study compares hydrologic flowpaths across a wide range of storm event magnitudes for three catchments mature tropical forest young secondary tropical forest and cattle pasture our conceptual model of the dominant factors that affect the runoff response and their interactions is outlined in fig 1 and it includes both variations in lulc as well as storm size and intensity because both of these variables are subject to rapid future change in parts of the humid tropics lambin 1997 sterling et al 2013 fabrega et al 2013 through geochemically based emma analysis we identify dominant hydrologic flowpaths during a total of 14 storm events six at the mature forest five at the young secondary forest and three at the cattle pasture during the 2017 wet season with peak runoff rates ranging across two orders of magnitude 0 14 to 40 9 mm hr and rainfall totals ranging from 5 6 mm to 60 6 mm additionally hillslope hydrometric data were used to characterize soil moisture conditions at multiple depths during an even broader range of events n 74 that occurred between 2015 and 2017 these characterizations were then used to corroborate emma results in the broader context of physical hydrologic processes within each catchment we used this combined hydrometric and geochemical approach to answer the following research questions 1 how do the dominant hydrologic flowpaths governing runoff generation differ in catchments across lulc and 2 how does the relative importance of these hydrologic flowpaths change over a range of antecedent conditions and rainfall magnitudes and intensities in addition to the identification of hydrologic flowpaths and their relative dominance across a wide range of hydrologic conditions and lulc our results provide valuable constraints that can be incorporated into physical hydrologic models to predict the impacts of future changes in both lulc and hydroclimate to water availability in similar humid tropical systems 2 methods 2 1 study site and instrumentation our study catchments are located within the agua salud watershed in central panama 9 12 60 n 79 44 55 w the agua salud watershed consists of a mosaic of small catchments of varying lulc and is part of a landscape scale research study initiated by the smithsonian tropical research institute stri to investigate lulc influences on ecosystem services stallard et al 2010 agua salud has wet and dry seasons driven by the annual migration of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz the wet season hydroclimate is characterized by high intensity convective thunderstorms and typically extends from early may until late december ten year mean rainfall at the site is 2657 mm yr paton 2018 elevation at agua salud ranges from 40 to 320 m above mean sea level with a tropical steepland terrane dominating the headwaters mean slope 30 hall et al 2015 the geology at the site is highly weathered basaltic and andesitic rock covered by up to 20 m of oxisols and inceptisols derived from in situ bedrock weathering these soils are highly weathered and well drained with infiltration rates highly variable depending on lulc hassler et al 2011 litt et al 2019 within the agua salud watershed we selected three study catchments 3 km apart ranging in size from 6 1 ha to 42 6 ha which are similar in slope mean slope 30 soils and geology but with contrasting vegetation cover and land use history table 1 fig 2 2 2 hydrometric data collection 2 2 1 streamflow and precipitation stream discharge was monitored and recorded every five minutes at the outlet of each of our study catchments using a combination of pressure sensors in situ leveltroll model 300 and 90 v notch concrete or steel weirs see ogden et al 2013 barometric data were used to create a custom pressure to discharge correction for each weir based on elevation differences between the weir and one of three barometric sensors the resulting discharge time series was then divided by the area of each catchment to yield a time series of runoff rates specific discharge in mm hr a tipping bucket precipitation gauge texas electronics tr 525 m measured precipitation in 0 254 mm increments every 5 min and was on a hilltop free of canopy cover on all sides fig 2 2 2 2 soil moisture soil moisture was recorded every 15 min decagon devices gs1 sensors at depths of 10 30 50 and 100 cm at three locations per catchment approximately 10 m apart along the planar hillslopes avoiding ridge crest and riparian zones calibration and data correction methodology for our volumetric water content vwc percent of total soil volume occupied by water measurements can be found in appendix a 1 following the onset of the wet season vwc was found to be minimally variable within 15 of the maximum at all depths and at all three catchments to account for this low variability in analysis and visualization vwc values were converted to relative percent saturation vwcrelative of instantaneous vwc value in comparison to the maximum vwc recorded by each sensor which we assumed to represent complete saturation of the soil matrix periods of sensor failure were not included in analysis 2 3 geochemical characterization 2 3 1 streamflow storm events were intensively sampled from may to august 2017 during the wet season samples were collected at the outlet of each catchment using automated samplers teledyne isco model 6712 programmed to begin collecting individual not composite samples every 15 60 min following an increase in stream stage large enough to be considered event driven polypropylene isco bottles were transported from the field to the laboratory where samples were filtered through combusted glass microfiber filters whatman glass microfiber filters grade gf f after filtration samples were stored in 60 ml brown plastic vials and frozen until analysis sample counts from individual events ranging from 5 to 20 samples depending on the programmed sampling interval at the time the event occurred and the length of the event a total of 14 storm events were sampled in this manner including six at the mat catchment five at the sec catchment and three at the pas catchment 2 3 2 hillslope end members composite samples from potential hillslope end members assumed to represent different shallow and surface hydrologic flowpaths were collected weekly and additionally following major storm events from july to august 2017 zero tension lysimeters 0 t were installed at depths of 10 30 and 50 cm at the top middle mid and bottom bot hillslope positions to capture preferential subsurface flow through the soil matrix difference infiltrometers moody ebel 2012 bush et al 2020 were used to collect composite overland flow samples and were installed at the top mid and bot hillslope positions at all three catchments throughfall was collected in the forested catchments by two parallel transects of six throughfall collectors installed along each hillslope in the forested catchments spanning from the ridgetop to the riparian zone throughfall collectors consisted of a 10 cm plastic funnel draining into a 1l brown plastic nalgene bottle all hillslope sampling instrumentation was emptied following each sampling event and rinsed with de ionized water prior to re deployment two to three groundwater wells installed at two to three meters below the soil surface in the riparian area of each catchment were sampled for riparian groundwater at each site visit roughly biweekly and rainfall was collected in an adjacent rainfall collector clear of canopy cover and debris in all directions end member samples were filtered and frozen until analysis 2 3 3 chemical analysis samples were thawed to sub sample for analysis and were then re frozen and stored at 32 c between analyses ion chromatography dionex aqioun ion chromatography system was used to analyze all samples for major cations ca2 na mg2 k and major anions cl so4 no3 duplicates were analyzed on 10 of those samples to quantify precision and known standards and analytical blanks were run during each analysis to verify accuracy mean accuracy for ion chromatography analysis was 2 5 from known values and precision for each analyzed solute based on analytical duplicates is given in table 2 of section 3 3 of results 2 4 hydrologic flowpath identification 2 4 1 hydrometric characterization volumetric moisture sensors were installed in may of 2015 but experienced frequent failures in order to characterize soil moisture conditions during storm events and allow for comparisons among catchments storms were selected from time periods 2015 2017 in each catchment where data were available at all four instrumented depths 10 30 50 and 100 cm this overlap most frequently occurred at the top hillslope position in each catchment and this position was subsequently used for analysis during periods where instrumentation was functioning at multiple hillslope positions fluctuations in vwcrelative were comparable among depths at various hillslope positions r2 ranging from 0 50 to 0 88 due to total equipment failure prior to 2017 in the pas catchment all storms used for characterization in this catchment were drawn from the 2015 wet season vwcrelative soil moisture profiles were used to assess the timing of saturation and connectivity at the various depths in each hillslope in relation to peak stormflow to characterize soil moisture conditions across a wide range of runoff event sizes storms were classified in each catchment based on the percentage of annual runoff generated at runoff rates below the peak runoff rate of each storm event stallard murphy 2014 this classification system was preferentially chosen over an exceedance probability derived classification system to better account for the contribution of a given class to total annual runoff generation rather than simply accounting for its frequency of occurrence using this classification system storms were separated into 0 50 50 75 75 90 and 90 100 event size classes once classified mean vwcrelative profiles and standard deviations of vwcrelative at each depth were calculated across all events in each storm class in 15 minute intervals from the period of 2 h before to 3 5 h after peak storm runoff this 5 5 h time window was selected based on observational data to capture as fully as possible 1 typical antecedent moisture conditions 2 soil moisture response to rainfall 3 soil moisture conditions during the runoff event and 4 soil moisture conditions during recession to pre event flow conditions while accounting for variability in storm duration and rainfall intensity 2 4 2 end member mixing analysis emma end member mixing analysis was done on all collected stream samples at each catchment following the methods of christopherson and hooper 1992 each solute considered for tracer selection was standardized by subtracting the mean concentration of that solute for a given water source and location and dividing by the standard deviation the standardized stream chemistry dataset for each stream was then examined using principal component analysis pca in the r 3 5 0 statistical programming language r core team 2018 mean end member concentrations were then volume weighted to better represent total flux then projected into principal component space using the eigenvectors from the stream chemistry principal component analysis pca stream and riparian groundwater samples were not weighted by flow nor volume after projection of stream samples standardized solute concentrations of potential hillslope end members were also projected into principal component space for visual inspection of each potential mixing scenario end member mixing analysis as described above was done on the stream solute dataset for each catchment using each possible combination of the solutes which were consistently found at detectable levels in streamflow cl no3 so4 2 mg2 ca2 na and k significant outliers from each of these datasets 5 8 of total samples were defined as any data point more than two standard deviations above or below the mean of the data and were removed before emma analysis this removal was done to prevent significant outliers resulting from geochemical anomalies or analytical errors from having a disproportionate influence on the results of pca end member mixing scenarios and tracer selections were based on criteria adapted from christopherson and hooper 1992 while also incorporating the results of our hydrometric characterizations as described below criteria for tracer selection 1 ability to distinguish between end members end members were required to occupy distinct regions in principal component space with minimal overlap 2 generation of a realistic mixing scenario stream chemistry must occupy the mixing space generated by end members such that the maximum number of projected stream samples can be described as a mixture of two or more end members 3 apparent conservative behavior of tracers on the scale of individual storm events bivariate scatter plots of solutes selected do not co vary in an apparent non linear fashion which would indicate non conservative mixing uptake or release 4 maximization of the percent of variance in each stream dataset explained by the first two principal components pc1 pc2 criteria for end member selection 1 the number of end members to be used in each catchment was calculated following the rule of one where 1 nth of the variation in stream chemistry must be explained by the last principal component retained with n equal to the number of tracers used 2 end members were selected based upon their ability to effectively explain variation in stream chemistry such that all or most stream samples can be represented as a mixture of two or more end members 3 agreement with hydrometric data such that hillslope end members which do not appear hydrologically connected to the stream based on hydrometric data do not contribute to runoff generation after selection of end member and tracer datasets for

values by multiplying hydrograph separation results end member fractions by the original mean end member solute concentrations mixing model fitness was quantified using simple linear regression between observed and back calculated stream solute concentrations with mixing model fitness as the coefficient of determination r2 between original and reproduced stream solute values 3 results 3 1 rainfall and runoff runoff rate exhibited a flashy response to rainfall events at all three catchments with runoff peaks typically occurring within 60 min of peak rainfall and receding within several hours peak runoff rates observed at the pas catchment far exceeded those at the mat and sec catchments fig 3 peak runoff rates observed during the intensive sampling period were 40 9 mm hr at the pas 15 1 mm hr at the sec and 12 7 mm hr at the mat fig 3 maximum daily rainfall during the intensive sampling period was 63 7 mm and during the overall 2017 wet season was 80 1 mm and occurred on october 22nd the total volume of water collected in 0 t lysimeters was greater by nearly an order of magnitude at the forested catchments then at the pas over the course of the intensive sampling period 200 mm of total water was collected in the six 0 t lysimeters at both the sec 248 mm and mat 230 mm catchments while only 40 mm total was collected at the pas large 10 mm increases in cumulative zero tension lysimeter collection at the sec and mat catchments occurred on the scale on single storm events while at the pas increases in zero tension lysimeter collection were gradual and showed little response to rainfall events fig s 2 3 2 soil moisture and runoff response variability in vwcrelative across a range of flow conditions generally decreased with depth with vwcrelative at 100 cm in all three catchments remaining within 10 of the maximum for the duration of the record at the mat and sec catchments runoff rate exhibited a non linear threshold relationship to vwcrelative at all four instrumented depths fig 4 this threshold behavior was most pronounced at the mat catchment the largest runoff rates observed at the mat and sec catchments occurred only when vwcrelative at all instrumented depths was within 5 of maximum relative saturation fig 4 at the pas catchment runoff rate was not clearly related to vwcrelative with the highest runoff rates occurring independent of and across a wide range of soil moisture conditions fig 4 during the highest runoff rate observed for which soil moisture data at the pas were available 71 4 mm hr vwcrelative at 10 cm depth was only 76 9 all storms used for characterization of the mat and sec catchments occurred during 2017 and were concurrent with the wet season period during which intensive storm sampling was undertaken 3 2 1 antecedent conditions for all three catchments vwcrelative was most variable at 10 cm vwcrelative at the 30 50 and 100 cm depth remained within 10 of the maximum for all storms for which there were data highlighting the low variability in antecedent wetness conditions in the deeper portions of the soil profile fig 5 this minimal variability is perhaps due to the high frequency of rainfall events occurring during the wet season rainfall was recorded on 69 of days from may to november 2017 seasonal variations in soil moisture were the largest at 10 cm 25 with deeper depths approaching the maximum at the onset of the wet season and remaining within 10 throughout soil moisture variations during events of similar size were similar regardless of the antecedent hydrologic conditions at the time during the wet season in which they occurred indicating little influence of antecedent conditions on the subsurface storm response fig 5 3 2 2 mature forest mat at the mat site the smallest runoff events 0 0 24 mm hr produced an increase in vwcrelative in only the top 10 cm of the soil and did not reach 100 relative saturation vwcrelative in deeper layers showed no response to precipitation fig 5 during storms of the 75 90 percent classification range 0 24 2 85 mm hr vwcrelative in the top 10 cm depth showed a greater response to precipitation than during smaller events notably during storms in the 75 90 percentile peak flow range vwcrelative at 30 cm depth reached near 100 for nearly all events with little variability at this depth only during the largest runoff events in the 90 100 percent classification range 2 85 mm hr did saturated or near saturated conditions occur at all soil depths during the largest events vwcrelative at both 30 cm and 50 cm peaked at the time of peak runoff and peak vwcrelative at 10 cm preceded peak runoff by 15 min 3 2 3 young secondary forest sec at the sec catchment antecedent soil moisture conditions were typically lower and more variable than at the mat during storm events soil moisture conditions at the sec behaved in a similar manner to the mat with the 30 cm depth approaching relative saturation during mid sized events and the lower depths only approaching saturation during the largest runoff events during the largest runoff events at the sec peak wetness occurred simultaneously with peak runoff at the 30 50 and 100 cm depths and approximately 15 min prior to peak runoff at 10 cm 3 2 4 cattle pasture pas vwcrelative in the top 10 cm at the pas showed little response to rainfall in events producing peak runoff rates less than 0 38 mm hr at this depth vwcrelative increased with increasing event size with storms below the 90 classification producing peak vwcrelative at 10 cm at the time of peak runoff fig 5 notably at the 50 100 cm depths there was minimal variability in comparison with the forested catchments and antecedent moisture conditions at these depths remained at or near maximum vwcrelative during and prior to events of all sizes during the largest runoff events 100 classification the pas produced nearly an order of magnitude greater peak runoff rates than events of a comparable class at the mat and sec during these events soil moisture response at all depths was delayed with peak vwcrelative occurring 30 min after the peak runoff rate 3 3 stream and potential end member geochemistry overland flow zero tension soil water and throughfall samples generally had higher volume weighted mean concentrations of biologically active solutes k no3 so4 2 in comparison to mean streamflow concentrations although concentrations were variable among all depths and catchments table 2 k in particular was higher in overland flow throughfall and zero tension soil water at both forested sites while at the pas k in zero tension soil water at all depths 1 2 1 4 mg l were comparable to streamflow 1 37 mg l but concentrations in overland flow were twice 2 54 mg l as high as other near surface end members in mat and sec so4 2 in zero tension soil water increased with depth this stratification was not observed at the pas where so4 2 in soil water was greater 1 8 1 9 mg l than mean streamflow 1 5 mg l but did not vary with depth table 2 volume weighted mean concentrations of primarily bedrock derived solutes mg2 ca2 na were substantially lower than both riparian groundwater and mean streamflow across all three catchments table 2 cl is primarily atmospherically derived but exhibits only minimal biological activity and followed the same trend as the primarily bedrock derived solutes cl in mean streamflow and riparian groundwater 3 9 13 mg l was greater than in near surface end members where cl was highly variable solute concentrations in riparian groundwater samples were generally comparable between catchments with the exception of cl which was elevated in both the mat and sec and so4 2 which was elevated at the pas relationships between primarily bedrock derived solutes were consistently linear across catchments except for mg and ca at the mat for which there was a high degree of scatter in the data fig 6 relationships between the biologically active solutes and bedrock derived solutes were more variable and differed in some instances among catchments k concentrations were inversely linear related with mg at the mat and sec catchments indicating conservative mixing between these two solutes fig 6 at the pas this relationship was less pronounced though at the highest runoff rate sampled during the study period in stream k was at its highest observed no3 exhibited a negative linear relationship with mg at the mat catchment that was not observed at either of the other catchments so4 2 was inversely related to mg at all three catchments though numerous outliers were observed throughout generally riparian groundwater did not resemble stream chemistry collected during low flow periods riparian groundwater was characterized by consistently higher concentrations of na mg so4 2 and ca than were observed in streamflow in each catchment indicating that this riparian groundwater is not likely a primary source of baseflow table 2 fig 6 k and mg proved useful in distinguishing among end members at all three catchments with high and variable k in near surface end members and constantly high mg during low flow periods optimal end member mixing scenarios for each catchment maximum variance explained by the first two principal components and their respective tracer combinations are shown in fig 7 at both the mat and sec catchments two end member mixing scenarios were suggested by the rule of one while at the pas a three end member scenario was required as riparian groundwater was not geochemically representative of low flow stream chemistry the most chemically extreme low flow stream sample from each catchment was assumed to represent the chemistry of the baseflow end member the most chemically extreme low flow sample was selected in favor of the lowest flow sample to 1 meet the assumptions of a two tracer three end member mixing model that all stream samples be bound by the selected end members and 2 because the runoff rate during baseflow increased by nearly an order of magnitude over the course of the study period fig 3 in all three catchments this would mean that the lowest flow sample collected during the study period would simply be the first low flow sample collected in may which would not necessarily be any more representative of baseflow chemistry when projected into principal component space stream samples at both the mat and sec catchment were best explained by a mixture of baseflow stream chemistry and zero tension soil water at the 30 cm depth fig 7 at the mat catchment these mixing scenarios agree with the hydrometric data fig 5 as during storm events in the 75 100 classification relative saturation occurred at 30 cm depth during and persisted the longest following peak runoff although saturated conditions at 30 cm only occurred at the sec catchment during the largest events 90 100 classification the two samples taken at highest storm flow are nearly identical in principal component space to zero tension soil water at 30 cm fig 7 at the pasture nearly all samples were bound by a mixture of baseflow zero tension soil water at varying depths and overland flow the overland flow end member exerted the greatest influence on stream chemistry at the highest runoff rate sampled fig 7 because the chemistry of zero tension soil water at the pas catchment varied little with depth zero tension soil water at 30 cm was selected as the third end member based on vwcrelative measurements showing dynamic behavior at this depth during storm events at the mat and sec catchments smaller runoff events events m1 s1 s2 were dominated by baseflow with the contribution from 30 cm soil water increasing with events size fig 8 a b during the largest events sampled at these catchments 30 cm soil water dominates runoff events m5 m6 s5 during the highest runoff rates sampled at the mat 2 75 mm hr during event m6 and sec 8 28 mm hr during event s5 catchments contribution of 30 cm soil water to runoff were 89 and 88 respectively at the pas catchment both of the smaller events sampled p1 p2 were dominated by baseflow with only marginal contributions from the 30 cm soil water and little to no overland flow fig 8c during the largest event sampled at the pas overland flow dominated runoff generation and contributed a maximum of 62 during the highest runoff rate sampled 35 3 mm hr total runoff and 22 mm hr overland flow during event p3 this would indicate the occurrence of widespread overland flow in the catchment as during event p3 40 9 mm of rainfall occurred with a maximum intensity of 12 2 mm hr during the entire 2017 wet season the average total rainfall for individual storm events at agua salud was 12 mm with an average maximum intensity of 9 mm hr based on these metrics storm p3 produced an above average rainfall total and maximum rainfall intensity the lack of sampled events between the storm size classes at the pas prevents us from commenting on the dominant flow pathways during intermediate events see fig s 1 for a full accounting of the characteristics of the intensively sampled storm events in the context of the entire 2017 water year 3 4 emma diagnostics r2 values between observed and back calculated stream solute concentrations were generally strong r2 0 58 to 0 93 and y intercepts were near zero indicating that the mixing models for each catchment are effective at re producing trends in stream chemistry slopes ranged from 0 74 to 1 28 indicating that the models may lead to some over or under prediction of the observed concentrations of certain solutes table 3 however slopes overall were close to one indicating that the mixing models and end members used are reasonably effective predictors of stream chemistry the r2 values between observed and back calculated stream solute concentrations were weakest at the pas catchment for so4 2 and k this weakness is likely due to the increased scatter in stream samples for these solutes at the pas which is outlined in fig 6 and may indicate an un characterized end member or some small degree of non conservative behavior of these solutes at this catchment 4 discussion 4 1 differences in hydrologic flowpaths across lulc the results of both emma and our soil moisture characterizations indicate that at the mat and sec catchments preferential flow through shallow soil horizons 30 cm is the dominant source of runoff generation during larger runoff events while pre event baseflow dominates smaller events this finding is consistent with previous studies in central panama and in the tropics writ large which have found higher macroporosity and abundant vertical and lateral preferential flowpaths in forests walsh howells 1988 chappell 2010 kinner and stallard 2004 cheng et al 2017 gardner et al 2017 our findings at the mat and sec catchments are also consistent with the rainfall simulation experiments conducted at agua salud by litt et al 2019 showing greater and deeper vertical transport in forest peak runoff rates during storms at both the mat and sec catchments were substantially lower than at the pas catchment while 0 t lysimeter collection was an order of magnitude higher this increased vertical percolation in mat is apparent in fig 5 where during the largest storm events the deeper soil horizons 30 100 cm at the sec and mat catchments reach near peak vwcrelative concurrent with peak storm runoff contrarily at the pas catchment the wetting of deeper soil horizons occurred substantially later 30 min during the largest runoff events indicating comparably lower vertical percolation in pas although based on only two 15 min measurement intervals during the largest runoff events evidence for the dominance of infiltration excess overland flow at the pas catchment was prevalent during the largest storm events peak runoff occurred 30 min prior to peak vwcrelative in the subsurface indicating that during these largest events peak runoff occurred independently of subsurface wetness conditions fig 5 while most samples collected fell on a geochemical spectrum between 0 t soil water and baseflow during the highest runoff rate sampled at the pas 35 3 mm hr runoff chemistry most closely resembled the geochemical characterization of overland flow the calculated overland flow fraction of runoff was 62 fig 7 fig 8 the occurrence of this infiltration excess overland flow is supported by previous plot scale observations litt et al 2019 bush et al 2020 and our findings indicate that this flowpath is a major contributor to storm runoff at pas this finding is also consistent with a number of studies in similar humid tropical regions where the occurrence of direct runoff via infiltration excess overland flow increased after the conversion of forested land to pasture muñoz villers mcdonnell 2013 algeet abarquero et al 2015 guzha et al 2015 differences between hydrologic flowpaths and vertical transmissivity between the forested sec mat and pastoral pas catchments are in line with the previously observed forest sponge effect and with other studies in the humid tropics which have identified these differences muñoz villers mcdonnell 2013 guzha et al 2015 while the preferential flowpath networks at the mat and sec catchments resulted in high contributions of soil water from 30 cm via preferential flow pathways during larger events these networks could also allow for greater vertical connectivity and higher rates of groundwater recharge previous modeling efforts at agua salud have required the inclusion of a deep vertical preferential flow network to accurately reproduce groundwater recharge and subsequent baseflow runoff rates cheng et al 2017 our vwcrelative results suggest that this deeper flowpath network may only become active during large events when deeper soil layers approach saturation this greater recharge may allow for the higher dry season baseflow and smaller wet season peak runoff rates observed in mat in contrast excess rainfall during large events at the pas is translated into infiltration excess overland flow bypassing storage and resulting in lower groundwater recharge and greater wet season peak runoff rates once the pasture soil is fully wet it drains slowly due to the lack of macropores streamflow at the mat catchment exhibited elevated mg2 na and ca2 in comparison to the other two catchments suggesting a minor difference in bedrock chemistry additionally the pas catchment 42 6 ha was substantially larger than both the mat and sec catchments while both of these factors may have some influence on runoff generating mechanisms we believe that the degree of difference in flowpath importance and function between them is primarily a function of land cover and land use history 4 2 variation in hydrologic flowpaths with storm characteristics and antecedent conditions results of our emma based hydrograph separations varied substantially in each catchment across the range of event magnitudes and intensities sampled highlighting the importance of sample size in flowpath identification studies during progressively larger rainfall events the fraction and magnitude of the 30 cm soil water component became greater at the mat and sec and during the two largest runoff events sampled this flowpath dominated runoff generation the variability in flowpath activation derived from our hydrograph separations in combination with a threshold response to soil moisture conditions implies a preferential flowpath network in the upper soil layer which only becomes active once certain wetness or rainfall intensity conditions have been met once active this network allows for the fast transmission of water from the hillslope to the stream producing the progressively higher runoff efficiencies with increasing event rainfall ogden et al 2013 at the pas hydrograph separation results varied widely among the three events sampled with the overland flow end member dominating only during the largest event sampled during the largest storm events soil moisture response to rainfall occurred 30 min after peak runoff runoff rates were frequently above 10 mm hr across a wide range of wetness conditions because runoff response during storm p3 at the pas occurred prior to an increase subsurface wetness conditions this would imply that the activation of overland flow depends on rainfall intensity rather than rainfall volume fig 8 this is supported by plot scale experiments where overland flow has been observed prior to the saturation of the upper soil matrix litt et al 2019 bush et al 2020 the activation of this infiltration excess overland flow path at high rainfall intensities explains the large event water contributions observed in large high intensity storm events by birch et al 2021 and the comparatively high runoff efficiencies reported by ogden et al 2013 for this catchment while a number of other studies have observed the occurrence of overland flow following the conversion of tropical forest to pasture the frequency of occurrence and its overall hydrologic importance has varied muñoz villers mcdonnell 2013 algeet abarquero et al 2015 guzha et al 2015 as the rainfall volume and intensity during storm p3 at the pas were not particularly high relative to the 2017 water year it is likely that overland flow is a frequent occurrence at the pas during moderately large events in studies conducted in other tropical regions flowpath activation and runoff response have shown varying degrees of sensitivity to both rainfall characteristics and antecedent moisture conditions while our analysis showed little sensitivity in runoff response to antecedent moisture conditions which showed limited variability during the wet season other studies in the tropics have found runoff response in a variety of land covers to increase in magnitude with increased antecedent wetness noguchi et al 1997 muñoz villers mcdonnell 2013 the apparent independence of runoff response to antecedent conditions in our catchments may be due to the high frequency of rainfall events at agua salud one every 2 3 days averaging 12 mm day during the wet season and the minimal variation in soil moisture conditions following the wet up at the onset of the wet season this may also be an effect of only sampling storm events following the onset of the wet season after which soil moisture conditions remained consistently wet litt et al 2015 suggested that events occurring early in the wet season may produce differing runoff responses than those occurring later though we were not able to observe this effect 4 3 implications for future environmental change and modeling future changes to hydroclimate such as increased storm magnitude and intensity karmalker and bradley nakayama et al 2012 fabrega et al 2013 and timing and duration of the wet season hidalgo et al 2013 are likely to have disproportionate non linear effects on the water balance of agua salud and similar humid tropical systems in the forested catchments mat sec our results suggest that more intense and larger storm events would increase the fraction of runoff contributed by subsurface preferential flow although this has the potential to increase both runoff efficiency and wet season groundwater recharge the well developed preferential flow network and high infiltration rates in mat make it likely that seasonal storage is less sensitive to changes in hydroclimate even during the largest events runoff efficiency in mat is relatively low in comparison to pasture ogden et al 2013 at the pas catchment overland flow only contributed marginally to runoff during two smaller events while dominating the largest event sampled as such future increases to storm size and intensity would likely make the occurrence of overland flow and the resulting increase in runoff efficiency in pasture more common the more frequent activation of overland flow in pasture as a result of increasing storm magnitude or intensity could increase disparities in runoff between forested and pasture as this would produce even greater losses of rainfall during wet season storm events from pasture which otherwise would have gone into the storage needed to maintain dry season baseflow the presence and activation of preferential flowpaths clearly plays a major role in both the lateral runoff generation and vertical groundwater recharge movement of water at the mat and sec catchments weiler mcdonnell 2007 shields tague 2012 litt et al 2019 these results provide observational support to the modeling study conducted at the sec catchment by cheng et al 2017 where a model structure incorporating both lateral and vertical preferential flow was necessary to accurately reproduce streamflow as such any further future efforts to model this system and similar systems in humid tropical regions must account for the presence and importance of this preferential flow occurring between 10 and 30 cm below the soil surface likewise at the pas catchment our results and those of studies previously conducted in the agua salud watershed indicate that infiltration excess overland flow while spatially limited and only occurring during large storms plays a major role in how rainfall is partitioned between streamflow and storage as such future modeling efforts should incorporate this flowpath to fully account for future changes to the flux of water through such systems 4 4 limitations of this study as with all studies utilizing emma for flowpath identification our results are limited by our degree of success in accurately characterizing the geochemistry of all potential end members and the conservative behavior of the tracers used burns et al 2001 a sampling of a groundwater source which was more representative of baseflow chemistry would have avoided the need to use streamflow itself as an end member and increased the robustness of our emma analysis this lack of a fully characterized groundwater end member may also indicate a missing end member in the three component hydrograph separation at the pas catchment which if identified could increase the robustness of our results although end member chemistry showed occasionally high degrees of variability the use of volume weighted means of these end members in combination were successful in reproducing observed fluctuations in stream chemistry table 3 assuming that tracer behavior is conservative on the scale of individual storm events this indicates that the hydrologic flowpath networks identified in this study can accurately describe the runoff responses observed in each catchment in a semi quantitative way with some degree of inherent uncertainty tracers used for each emma model were screened for non conservative behavior and bivariate solute plots revealed largely linear relationships between them at the mat and sec catchments p 0 05 r2 ranging from 0 18 to 0 66 for simple linear regressions our sample size of storm events was lowest at the pas catchment n 3 and bivariate solute plots showed weaker linear relationships p 0 05 r2 ranging from 0 06 to 0 50 for simple linear regressions between the tracers used suggesting the possibility of some non conservative behavior despite this uncertainty we believe our flowpath identifications at this catchment are accurate based on agreement with hillslope hydrometric data fig 5 and supportive results from previous studies at the site the use of additional tracers like doc may have added some benefit to more discretely distinguishing between potential end members however by informing our emma analysis and ensuring agreement with physical hydrometric measurements from each hillslope we have strengthened our results by accounting for the discrepancies reported in previous studies between tracer based hydrograph separation results and physical hillslope measurements sklash et al 1986 hangen et al 2001 klaus mcdonnell 2013 additionally the minor differences in geology observed at the mat catchment and differences in size between our study catchments may lead to some additional uncertainty as these factors can affect mechanisms of runoff generation however given the magnitude of the observed differences between the catchments we are confident that differences in hydrologic flowpaths and runoff generation between them can be primarily attributed to land cover 5 conclusions we identified hydrologic flowpaths across three humid tropical catchments mature tropical forest young secondary tropical forest and cattle pasture to determine how these vary with respect to lulc antecedent moisture conditions and rainfall characteristics using a combined approach of geochemical end member mixing and hillslope hydrometric characterizations our results indicate that both lulc and rainfall characteristics influenced the presence and activation of hydrologic flowpaths in each catchment in all three catchments pre event baseflow dominated runoff during smaller less intense events with the relative contributions of fast flowpaths becoming increasingly dominant with increasing event size at the two forested catchments preferential flow within the top 30 cm of the soil column dominated runoff generation during the largest events sampled while at a pastoral catchment infiltration excess overland flow became active and dominated the hydrograph during the largest sampled event our results provide evidence for the mechanisms behind the forest sponge effect previously observed in some humid tropical systems this effect may intensify with future changes to hydroclimate credit authorship contribution statement andrew l birch

4733,reservoirs are important for water resources management including water storage flood control and power generation at the same time reservoirs cause water losses through evaporation as the largest developing country in the world china has built a large number of reservoirs and it is necessary to estimate china s reservoir evaporation losses this study estimated monthly reservoir evaporation losses for 916 large reservoirs in china from 1985 to 2018 total evaporation losses significantly increased p 0 05 because of significant increases in evaporation rate p 0 05 and reservoir surface area p 0 05 from 1985 to 2018 in 2018 total reservoir evaporation losses were 140 2 108 m3 which is about 1 1 times the amount of water transferred in the middle route of the south to north water transfer project in china total evaporation losses of large reservoirs in china are significantly smaller than that in the united states although total storage capacities of large reservoirs in the two countries are similar this is mainly due to the larger average depth and smaller area of china s large reservoirs the results provide a useful reference for reservoir design and water

leading to increased reservoir evaporation losses either from a global or regional perspective reservoir evaporation losses cannot be ignored from a global perspective shiklomanov 1999 estimated that global reservoir evaporation volume is about 188 km3 in 1995 which is larger than global domestic and industrial water consumption of the year 132 km3 from a regional perspective zhao and gao 2019

image enhancement algorithm and the gswd accurate and continuous reservoir surface area dataset namely the global reservoir surface area dataset grsad was produced zhao gao 2018 reservoir evaporation rate can be estimated by various methods including pan evaporation method the penman equation penman 1948 and variants of the penman equation such as the priestley taylor equation priestley taylor 1972 the pan evaporation method estimates reservoir evaporation rate by multiplying measured pan evaporation and prescribed pan coefficient kişi 2006 mcmahon et al 2013 wang et al 2019a bai et al 2020 the method has its limitations such as ignoring the microclimate difference between reservoir and pan and not considering the effect of heat storage of large reservoir on evaporation mcmahon et al 2013 friedrich et al 2018 the penman equation and its variants can calculate the effect of heat storage of large reservoir on evaporation the effect can be calculated using the equilibrium temperature which is the water temperature without heat exchange between air and water under constant forcing edinger et al 1968 derivation of the equilibrium temperature is based on the energy balance of water body zhao et al 2019 developed a general and accurate method to calculate the equilibrium temperature based on previous studies mohseni stefan 1999 mcmahon et al 2013 and incorporated this method into the penman equation to estimate reservoir evaporation rate in the united states by comparing the observed and calculated reservoir evaporation rate zhao and gao 2019 found that the penman equation incorporated with heat storage can accurately estimate reservoir evaporation rate as the world s largest developing country china has built about 98 822 reservoirs by 2018 mwr 2019a the total storage capacity of these reservoirs reached 895 3 km3 which is about ten times the domestic water consumption of china in 2018 mwr 2019b these reservoirs bring a lot of evaporation losses thus it is necessary to accurately estimate reservoir evaporation losses in china in this study we estimated monthly reservoir evaporation for large reservoirs of china from 1985 to 2018 using the grsad and the penman equation incorporated with the heat storage the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we synthesized data and methodology used in this study in section 3 we investigated changes in

vapor pressure deficit vpd surface shortwave radiation ssr and wind speed u these data were obtained from terraclimate dataset with a spatial resolution of 1 24 abatzoglou et al 2018 for each reservoir monthly meteorological variables were generated by averaging the overlapping cells from the gridded terraclimate dataset with the corresponding reservoir shapefile two other datasets namely china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd he et al 2020 and era5 hersbach et al 2020 were also used as forcing data to calculate evaporation rates for temporal resolution cmfd and era5 are both

evaporation rate in 2018 was 2 71 mm d fig 4 a for the ten major river basins the prb had the largest average evaporation rate in 2018 with a value of 3 21 mm d while the shrb had the smallest average

fig 4 d 3 3 magnitudes and trends of reservoir evaporation volume for the 916 reservoirs as a whole the total reservoir evaporation volume was 140 2 108 m3 in 2018 the largest total reservoir evaporation volume occurred in 2017 with a value of 142 9 108 m3 fig 5 a which is about 1 1 times the amount of water transferred in the middle route of the south to north water transfer project in china 130 0 108 m3 for the ten major river basins the yzrb had the largest reservoir evaporation volume with 45 8 108 m3 in 2018 accounting for 32 7 of the total reservoir evaporation volume of china the nrb had the smallest reservoir evaporation volume with 1 6 108 m3 in 2018 accounting for 1 1 of the total reservoir evaporation volume of china fig 5 b for the 916 reservoirs their average reservoir evaporation volumes had large spatial heterogeneity ranging from 0 1 106 m3 to 1 427 5 106 m3 with a median value of 3 1 106 m3 fig 5 c because significant increases p 0 05 in reservoir surface area and evaporation rate from 1985 to 2018 total reservoir evaporation volume of china showed a significant p 0 05 increasing trend with a value of 2 0 108 m3 a fig 5 a for the ten major river basins reservoir evaporation volumes of 9 basins except the lrb had increasing trends their increasing trends have passed the significance test p 0 05 except for the harb the yzrb had the

evaporation volume of which 120 reservoirs have passed the significance test p 0 05 fig 5 d 4 discussion 4 1 attribution analysis among the 916 reservoirs 677 reservoirs were built before 1985 and the rest 239 reservoirs were built during 1985 to 2018 thus the 916 reservoirs were divided into two categories namely reservoirs built before 1985 and reservoirs built after 1985 for the 677 reservoirs built before 1985 the total evaporation volume showed a nonsignificant p 0 19 increasing trend with a value of 0 1 108 m3 a for the 239 reservoirs built after 1985 the total evaporation volume showed a significant p 0 05 increasing trend with a value of 1 9 108 m3 a fig 6 the significant increase in total evaporation volume of the 916 reservoirs was mainly attributed to the significant increase in total evaporation volume of the 239 reservoirs built after 1985 with a contribution rate of 96 1 9 108 2 0 108 for reservoirs built after 1985 the significant increasing trend of total evaporation volume is due to the significant increasing trends of total reservoir area 200 1 km2 a p 0 05 and evaporation rate 0 0044 mm d a p 0 05 for reservoirs built before 1985 the insignificant increasing trend of total evaporation volume is mainly due to the increasing trend in the evaporation rate 0 0067 mm d a p 0 05 being counterbalanced by the decreasing trend in total reservoir area 14 0 km2 a p 0 21 for each reservoir first the detrending method was used to analyze the contributions of change in ta vpd ssr u and surface area to the trend of evaporation volume the variable with the largest contribution to the trend of the evaporation volume is regarded as the main contribution variable among the 916 reservoirs the numbers of reservoirs whose main contribution variable is ta vpd ssr u and surface area were 6 6 235 3 and 666 respectively fig 7 a the median values of contributions of the five variables to the trend of evaporation volume among the 916 reservoirs were 3 0 1 5 4 3 0 3 and 83 2 respectively fig 7 c thus the change in reservoir surface area contributes the most to the trend of evaporation volume then the detrending method was used to analyze the contributions of change in ta vpd ssr and u to the trend of evaporation rate for each reservoir among the 916 reservoirs the numbers of reservoirs whose main contribution variable is ta vpd ssr and u were 59 27 813 and 17 respectively fig 7 b the median values of contributions of the four variables to the trend of evaporation rate among the 916 reservoirs were 20 7 18 2 54 2 and 0 1 respectively fig 7 d thus the change in ssr dominates the trend of evaporation rate 4 2 comparison of reservoir evaporation in china and the united states the grand shows that the united states and china have the world s largest and second largest number of large reservoirs respectively and the total storage capacities of large reservoirs in the united states and china are similar 685 km3 vs 666 km3 thus this study compares the reservoir evaporation of the two countries zhao and gao 2019 calculated the evaporation volume of 718 reservoirs with a storage capacity greater than 0 1 km3 in grand dataset in the united states from 1985 to 2014 the calculation result of zhao and gao 2019 is compared with this study there are 522 reservoirs with a storage capacity greater than 0 1 km3 in grand dataset in china in 2014 total storage capacities of the reservoirs with a storage capacity greater than 0 1 km3 for china and the united states are 666 km3 and 685 km3 in 2014 respectively for these reservoirs in china and the united states average annual evaporation volumes are 9 1 109 m3 and 34 0 109 m3 from 1985 to 2014 respectively fig 8 a the evaporation volume of these large reservoirs in the united states is significantly greater than that in china although their total storage capacities are similar 685 km3 vs 666 km3 reservoir evaporation volume is calculated by multiplying reservoir area and evaporation rate from 1985 to 2014 average evaporation rates in china and the united states are 2 69 mm d and 2 82 mm d respectively while corresponding average total reservoir areas of the large reservoirs in the two countries are 9 6 109 m2 and 33 9 109 m2 respectively fig 8 b c the significant difference in reservoir evaporation volume between china and the united states is mainly due to the differences in reservoir area the reservoir area and depth determine the storage capacity of a reservoir there are significant differences in the reservoir depth between china and the united states the median value of the depth of the 522 large reservoirs in china is 31 8 m which is greater than that of the 718 large reservoirs in the united states 21 9 m fig 8 e china has less reservoir surface area than the united states although the storage capacities of these large reservoirs in the two countries are similar total evaporation volume of the 718 large reservoirs in the united states showed an insignificant increasing trend p 0 19 from 1985 to 2014 with a value of 3 3 107 m3 a total evaporation volume of the 522 large reservoirs in china showed a significant p 0 05 increasing trend with a value of 16 2 107 m3 a fig 8 a the insignificant increasing trend of total evaporation volume in the united states is mainly due to the small increasing trend in the evaporation rate 0 0052 mm d a p 0 05 being counterbalanced by the slight decreasing trend in total reservoir areas 10 9 km2 a p 0 45 the significant increasing trend of total evaporation volume in china is due to the significant increasing trends of total reservoir area 141 8 km2 a p 0 05 and evaporation rate 0 0082 mm d a p 0 05 additionally from 1985 to 2014 china has built 212 new large reservoirs while the united states only built 22 fig 8 d the significant increase in the number of reservoirs in china has caused a significant increase in the reservoir area 4 3 impact of the change of heat storageδu on reservoir evaporate rate the change of heat storage δu can significantly affect reservoir evaporation rate especially for deep reservoirs depth greater than 3 m to investigate the impact of δu on reservoir evaporate rate the evaporation rate was calculated with and without considering δu respectively compared with the evaporation rate calculated without δu the evaporation rate calculated with δu had clear lag times fig 9 the estimated lag time was calculated in two steps 1 the correlations between the evaporation rates calculated with and without δu at all possible lag times were calculated the possible lag times in this study is set from 0 to 12 months 2 the estimated lag time was the lag time corresponding to the largest value among these correlations fig 9 a to g show the two types of evaporation rates from 1985 to 2018 with a lag time of 0 to 6 months respectively among the 916 reservoirs the numbers of reservoirs with a lag time from 0 to 6 months were 42 48 160 454 183 17 and 12 respectively fig 9 h the mean lag time for the 916 reservoirs was 2 9 months additionally the average annual evaporation rate without δu is greater than the average annual evaporation rate with δu fig 9 a g this indicates that δu must be considered in calculating the reservoir evaporation rate in addition the relationship between the net radiation rn and δu was investigated the significant positive correlation was found between rn and δu r 0 71 p 0 01 thus δu can be approximately estimated by rn when other meteorological elements are not available fig 10 4 4 uncertainty there are uncertainties in the estimation of reservoir evaporation in this study first the reservoir evaporation rate cannot simulate ice sublimation reservoir surface would freeze when ta descends below 0 c this mainly happens in the winter in high latitude area such as northeast china therefore the reservoir evaporation rate of the shrb and lrb may be inaccurately estimated there are 78 reservoirs 68 10 in these two major river basins accounting for 8 2 of the total 916 reservoirs the uncertainty of evaporation volumes in these 78 reservoirs would not have much impact on the overall evaporation estimation of the 916 reservoirs to accurately estimate the evaporation rate in high latitudes ice sublimation process should be considered in the future second the meteorological data used to calculate evaporation has uncertainty the meteorological data is obtained from terraclimate dataset terraclimate dataset is developed based on japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 project climate research unit time series data version 4 0 cru ts4 0 and worldclim dataset abatzoglou et al 2018 uncertainties in the three datasets such as inhomogeneities in cru ts4 0 and jra 55 are entrained into terraclimate abatzoglou et al 2018 these may cause some uncertainty in evaporation estimations third a single forcing data may bring uncertainty in the estimation of evaporation rate and volume to explore this uncertainty two other datasets namely cmfd and era5 were used as forcing data to calculate evaporation rates fig 11 the average annual evaporation rates calculated with the three forcing datasets namely terraclimate cmfd and era5 were 2 7 mm d 2 3 mm d and 2 5 mm d from 1985 to 2018 respectively the average annual evaporation rates calculated with the three forcing datasets namely terraclimate cmfd and era5 were 2 7 mm d 2 3 mm d and 2 5 mm d from 1985 to 2018 respectively the annual evaporation rates calculated with the three forcing data all showed significant increasing trends with the values of 5 5 10 3 mm d a 4 8 10 3 mm d a and 6 0 10 3 mm d a respectively the annual evaporation volumes calculated with the three forcing datasets were 10 6 109 m3 9 2 109 m3 and 10 0 109 m3 from 1985 to 2018 respectively the annual evaporation volumes calculated with the three forcing datasets all showed significant increasing trends with the values of 2 0 108 m3 a 1 7 108 m3 a and 1 9 108 m3 a respectively thus using a single forcing dataset did not bring large uncertainty to the estimation of total reservoir evaporation volume in this study 4 5 potential applications the study provides a useful reference for water resources management in china first the accurate estimation of reservoir evaporation volume could help to accurately estimate available water resources for a reservoir precipitation inflow and outflow can be accurately observed once reservoir evaporation is accurately estimated available water resources can be accurately obtained zhang et al 2019b this can help managers allocate water resources more reasonably second accurate estimation of reservoir evaporation volume could help to estimate water saving efficiency in arid and semi arid regions water resources managers usually place different covers on the water surface to reduce evaporation because of huge reservoir evaporation loss the water saving efficiency can be calculated based on the calculated reservoir evaporation and the observed evaporation under different covers yao et al 2010 which helps to select suitable covers for reducing reservoir evaporation 5 conclusions this study estimated monthly reservoir evaporation for the 916 large reservoirs in china from 1985 to 2018 using the grsad and the penman equation the magnitudes and trends of reservoir surface area evaporation rate and reservoir evaporation volume were analyzed for the 916 reservoirs as a whole the total reservoir evaporation volume from 1985 to 2018 showed a significant p 0 05 increasing trend with a value of 2 0 108 m3 a the increase is due to significant increases p 0 05 in reservoir surface area and evaporation rate from 1985 to 2018 with a value of 186 1 km2 a and 0 006 mm d a respectively the largest total reservoir evaporation volume was 142 9 108 m3 in 2017 which is about 1 1 times the amount of water transferred in the middle route of the south to north water transfer project in china for the ten major river basins the yzrb had the largest total reservoir evaporation volume with 45 8 108 m3 in 2018 accounting for 32 7 of the total reservoir evaporation volume of china the yzrb also had the largest increasing trend in total reservoir evaporation volume with a value of 74 4 106 m3 a the results provide a useful reference for water resources management and reservoir design in china

4733,reservoirs are important for water resources management including water storage flood control and power generation at the same time reservoirs cause water losses through evaporation as the largest developing country in the world china has built a large number of reservoirs and it is necessary to estimate china s reservoir evaporation losses this study estimated monthly reservoir evaporation losses for 916 large reservoirs in china from 1985 to 2018 total evaporation losses significantly increased p 0 05 because of significant increases in evaporation rate p 0 05 and reservoir surface area p 0 05 from 1985 to 2018 in 2018 total reservoir evaporation losses were 140 2 108 m3 which is about 1 1 times the amount of water transferred in the middle route of the south to north water transfer project in china total evaporation losses of large reservoirs in china are significantly smaller than that in the united states although total storage capacities of large reservoirs in the two countries are similar this is mainly due to the larger average depth and smaller area of china s large reservoirs the results provide a useful reference for reservoir design and water resources management in the world keywords reservoir water surface evaporation water resources management 1 introduction reservoirs play a key role in water resources management including water supply hydropower generation and flood control world commission on dams 2000 prigent et al 2012 zhang et al 2019a about 16 7 million reservoirs with a surface area larger than 100 m2 have been built worldwide lehner et al 2011 with the increase in the number of reservoirs total water surface area of global reservoirs increased from 4 11 105 km2 in 1984 to 4 48 105 km2 in 2015 zhao and gao 2018 leading to increased reservoir evaporation losses either from a global or regional perspective reservoir evaporation losses cannot be ignored from a global perspective shiklomanov 1999 estimated that global reservoir evaporation volume is about 188 km3 in 1995 which is larger than global domestic and industrial water consumption of the year 132 km3 from a regional perspective zhao and gao 2019 showed that annual total reservoir evaporation from large reservoirs storage capacity greater than 0 1 km3 in the united states is equivalent to 93 of annual public water supply of the country in 2010 craig et al 2005 reported that annual total reservoir evaporation from farm reservoirs in queensland and new south wales in australia is up to 40 of the storage capacity of these reservoirs zhang et al 2017 found that annual total reservoir evaporation from 200 reservoirs in texas in the united states is equivalent to 53 of annual local water use reservoir evaporation volume is calculated by multiplying reservoir surface area and evaporation rate reservoir surface area can be estimated from field measurement and remote sensing images huang et al 2018 for the field measurement reservoir surface area is estimated from observed reservoir water level and water level reservoir area relationship crétaux et al 2015 pipitone et al 2018 the field measurement has its limitations such as high cost and change in the water level reservoir area relationship due to sedimentation compared with the field measurement the method using remote sensing images has advantages of low cost global coverage and easy access mcfeeters 1996 sawaya et al 2003 gao 2015 among multiple remote sensing images the landsat image has long temporal coverage and high spatial resolution and it is suitable for extracting water surface area olmanson et al 2011 pekel et al 2016 khandelwal et al 2017 yao et al 2019 using 3 million landsat images pekel et al 2016 produced a high resolution mapping of global surface water namely the global surface water dataset gswd the gswd has been used worldwide while busker et al 2019 found that water surface area cannot be accurately estimated once the landsat image is contaminated by a large area of clouds to generate accurate estimations of water surface area zhao and gao 2018 developed an image enhancement algorithm to repair contaminated images based on the image enhancement algorithm and the gswd accurate and continuous reservoir surface area dataset namely the global reservoir surface area dataset grsad was produced zhao gao 2018 reservoir evaporation rate can be estimated by various methods including pan evaporation method the penman equation penman 1948 and variants of the penman equation such as the priestley taylor equation priestley taylor 1972 the pan evaporation method estimates reservoir evaporation rate by multiplying measured pan evaporation and prescribed pan coefficient kişi 2006 mcmahon et al 2013 wang et al 2019a bai et al 2020 the method has its limitations such as ignoring the microclimate difference between reservoir and pan and not considering the effect of heat storage of large reservoir on evaporation mcmahon et al 2013 friedrich et al 2018 the penman equation and its variants can calculate the effect of heat storage of large reservoir on evaporation the effect can be calculated using the equilibrium temperature which is the water temperature without heat exchange between air and water under constant forcing edinger et al 1968 derivation of the equilibrium temperature is based on the energy balance of water body zhao et al 2019 developed a general and accurate method to calculate the equilibrium temperature based on previous studies mohseni stefan 1999 mcmahon et al 2013 and incorporated this method into the penman equation to estimate reservoir evaporation rate in the united states by comparing the observed and calculated reservoir evaporation rate zhao and gao 2019 found that the penman equation incorporated with heat storage can accurately estimate reservoir evaporation rate as the world s largest developing country china has built about 98 822 reservoirs by 2018 mwr 2019a the total storage capacity of these reservoirs reached 895 3 km3 which is about ten times the domestic water consumption of china in 2018 mwr 2019b these reservoirs bring a lot of evaporation losses thus it is necessary to accurately estimate reservoir evaporation losses in china in this study we estimated monthly reservoir evaporation for large reservoirs of china from 1985 to 2018 using the grsad and the penman equation incorporated with the heat storage the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we synthesized data and methodology used in this study in section 3 we investigated changes in reservoir surface area evaporation rate and reservoir evaporation volume the discussion and conclusions are in sections 4 and 5 respectively 2 data and methodology 2 1 data the global reservoir and dam database grand collects basic information of 916 large reservoirs in china such as location depth and storage capacity etc lehner et al 2011 http globaldamwatch org the total storage capacity of the 916 reservoirs accounts for 73 5 of total storage capacity of reservoirs in china mwr 2019a these 916 reservoirs are distributed in ten major river basins in china namely the songhua river basin

the ten major river basins there are 9 reservoirs in the nrb in 2018 with the least number of reservoirs fig 1 monthly surface areas of the 916 reservoirs were obtained from the grsad zhao gao 2018

vapor pressure deficit vpd surface shortwave radiation ssr and wind speed u these data were obtained from terraclimate dataset with a spatial resolution of 1 24 abatzoglou et al 2018 for each reservoir monthly meteorological variables were generated by averaging the overlapping cells from the gridded terraclimate dataset with the corresponding reservoir shapefile two other datasets namely china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd he et al 2020 and era5 hersbach et al 2020 were also used as forcing data to calculate evaporation rates for temporal resolution cmfd and era5 are both

reservoir surface areas in the grsad dataset the number of large reservoirs in china increased from 682 in 1985 to 916 in 2018 the total surface area of these reservoirs reached 14 771 3 km2 in 2018 fig 2 a for the ten major river basins the yzrb had the largest reservoir surface area with 4 848 7 km2 in 2018 accounting for 32 8 of the total surface area of the 916 reservoirs the nrb had the smallest reservoir surface area with 202 2 km2 in 2018 accounting for 1 4 of the total reservoir area fig 2 b for the 916 reservoirs their surface area had significant spatial heterogeneity ranging from 0 1 km2 to 1 411 3 km2 with a median value of 3 7 km2 fig 2 c with the rapid increase in the number of large reservoirs the total reservoir surface area increased significantly p 0 05 from 8 463 3 km2 in 1985 to 14 771 3 km2 in 2018 with a value of 186 1 km2 a fig 2 a for the ten major river basins reservoir surface area of 9 basins except the lrb had increasing trends these increasing trends

smallest increasing trend with a value of 0 4 km2 a for the 916 reservoirs there are 460 reservoirs showing an upward trend in the reservoir area of which 211 reservoirs have passed the significance test p 0 05 there are 456 reservoirs showing a downward trend in the reservoir area of which 209 reservoirs have passed the significance test p 0 05 fig 2 d 3 2 magnitudes and trends of reservoir evaporation rate to evaluate the reliability of the penman method for calculating the evaporation rate the observed and modeled evaporations of 47 reservoirs in china are compared the observed average annual evaporations of the 47 reservoirs were obtained through literature review fig s1 and table s1 and the modeled average annual evaporations of the 47 reservoirs were calculated by eq 1 as shown in fig 3 the modeled average annual evaporations are consistent with the observed average annual evaporations with percent bias pbias nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and root mean square error rmse of 0 02 0 82 and 11 2 mm respectively the good agreement indicates that it is reliable to calculate reservoir evaporation rate in china using the penman method for the 916 reservoirs as a whole the average evaporation rate in 2018 was 2 71 mm d fig 4 a for the ten major river basins the prb had the largest average evaporation rate in 2018 with a value of 3 21 mm d while the shrb had the smallest average

fig 4 d 3 3 magnitudes and trends of reservoir evaporation volume for the 916 reservoirs as a whole the total reservoir evaporation volume was 140 2 108 m3 in 2018 the largest total reservoir evaporation volume occurred in 2017 with a value of 142 9 108 m3 fig 5 a which is about 1 1 times the amount of water transferred in the middle route of the south to north water transfer project in china 130 0 108 m3 for the ten major river basins the yzrb had the largest reservoir evaporation volume with 45 8 108 m3 in 2018 accounting for 32 7 of the total reservoir evaporation volume of china the nrb had the smallest reservoir evaporation volume with 1 6 108 m3 in 2018 accounting for 1 1 of the total reservoir evaporation volume of china fig 5 b for the 916 reservoirs their average reservoir evaporation volumes had large spatial heterogeneity ranging from 0 1 106 m3 to 1 427 5 106 m3 with a median value of 3 1 106 m3 fig 5 c because significant increases p 0 05 in reservoir surface area and evaporation rate from 1985 to 2018 total reservoir evaporation volume of china showed a significant p 0 05 increasing trend with a value of 2 0 108 m3 a fig 5 a for the ten major river basins reservoir evaporation volumes of 9 basins except the lrb had increasing trends their increasing trends have passed the significance test p 0 05 except for the harb the yzrb had the largest increasing trend in reservoir evaporation volume with a value of 74 4 106 m3 a while the harb had the smallest increasing trend with a value of 1 7 106 m3 a for the 916 reservoirs there are 584 reservoirs showing an upward trend in reservoir evaporation volume of which 260 reservoirs have passed the significance test p 0 05 there are 332 reservoirs showing a downward trend in reservoir evaporation volume of which 120 reservoirs have passed the significance test p 0 05 fig 5 d 4 discussion 4 1 attribution analysis among the 916 reservoirs 677 reservoirs were built before 1985 and the rest 239 reservoirs were built during 1985 to 2018 thus the 916 reservoirs were divided into two categories namely reservoirs built before 1985 and reservoirs built after 1985 for the 677 reservoirs built before 1985 the total evaporation volume showed a nonsignificant p 0 19 increasing trend with a value of 0 1 108 m3 a for the 239 reservoirs built after 1985 the total evaporation volume showed a significant p 0 05 increasing trend with a value of 1 9 108 m3 a fig 6 the significant increase in total evaporation volume of the 916 reservoirs was mainly attributed to the significant increase in total evaporation volume of the 239 reservoirs built after 1985 with a contribution rate of 96 1 9 108 2 0 108 for reservoirs built after 1985 the significant increasing trend of total evaporation volume is due to the significant increasing trends of total reservoir area 200 1 km2 a p 0 05 and evaporation rate 0 0044 mm d a p 0 05 for reservoirs built before 1985 the insignificant increasing trend of total evaporation volume is mainly due to the increasing trend in the evaporation rate 0 0067 mm d a p 0 05 being counterbalanced by the decreasing trend in total reservoir area 14 0 km2 a p 0 21 for each reservoir first the detrending method was used to analyze the contributions of change in ta vpd ssr u and surface area to the trend of evaporation volume the variable with the largest contribution to the trend of the evaporation volume is regarded as the main contribution variable among the 916 reservoirs the numbers of reservoirs whose main contribution variable is ta vpd ssr u and surface area were 6 6 235 3 and 666 respectively fig 7 a the median values of contributions of the five variables to the trend of evaporation volume among the 916 reservoirs were 3 0 1 5 4 3 0 3 and 83 2 respectively fig 7 c thus the change in reservoir surface area contributes the most to the trend of evaporation volume then the detrending method was used to analyze the contributions of change in ta vpd ssr and u to the trend of evaporation rate for each reservoir among the 916 reservoirs the numbers of reservoirs whose main contribution variable is ta vpd ssr and u were 59 27 813 and 17 respectively fig 7 b the median values of contributions of the four variables to the trend of evaporation rate among the 916 reservoirs were 20 7 18 2 54 2 and 0 1 respectively fig 7 d thus the change in ssr dominates the trend of evaporation rate 4 2 comparison of reservoir evaporation in china and the united states the grand shows that the united states and china have the world s largest and second largest number of large reservoirs respectively and the total storage capacities of large reservoirs in the united states and china are similar 685 km3 vs 666 km3 thus this study compares the reservoir evaporation of the two countries zhao and gao 2019 calculated the evaporation volume of 718 reservoirs with a storage capacity greater than 0 1 km3 in grand dataset in the united states from 1985 to 2014 the calculation result of zhao and gao 2019 is compared with this study there are 522 reservoirs with a storage capacity greater than 0 1 km3 in grand dataset in china in 2014 total storage capacities of the reservoirs with a storage capacity greater than 0 1 km3 for china and the united states are 666 km3 and 685 km3 in 2014 respectively for these reservoirs in china and the united states average annual evaporation volumes are 9 1 109 m3 and 34 0 109 m3 from 1985 to 2014 respectively fig 8 a the evaporation volume of these large reservoirs in the united states is significantly greater than that in china although their total storage capacities are similar 685 km3 vs 666 km3 reservoir evaporation volume is calculated by multiplying reservoir area and evaporation rate from 1985 to 2014 average evaporation rates in china and the united states are 2 69 mm d and 2 82 mm d respectively while corresponding average total reservoir areas of the large reservoirs in the two countries are 9 6 109 m2 and 33 9 109 m2 respectively fig 8 b c the significant difference in reservoir evaporation volume between china and the united states is mainly due to the differences in reservoir area the reservoir area and depth determine the storage capacity of a reservoir there are significant differences in the reservoir depth between china and the united states the median value of the depth of the 522 large reservoirs in china is 31 8 m which is greater than that of the 718 large reservoirs in the united states 21 9 m fig 8 e china has less reservoir surface area than the united states although the storage capacities of these large reservoirs in the two countries are similar total evaporation volume of the 718 large reservoirs in the united states showed an insignificant increasing trend p 0 19 from 1985 to 2014 with a value of 3 3 107 m3 a total evaporation volume of the 522 large reservoirs in china showed a significant p 0 05 increasing trend with a value of 16 2 107 m3 a fig 8 a the insignificant increasing trend of total evaporation volume in the united states is mainly due to the small increasing trend in the evaporation rate 0 0052 mm d a p 0 05 being counterbalanced by the slight decreasing trend in total reservoir areas 10 9 km2 a p 0 45 the significant increasing trend of total evaporation volume in china is due to the significant increasing trends of total reservoir area 141 8 km2 a p 0 05 and evaporation rate 0 0082 mm d a p 0 05 additionally from 1985 to 2014 china has built 212 new large reservoirs while the united states only built 22 fig 8 d the significant increase in the number of reservoirs in china has caused a significant increase in the reservoir area 4 3 impact of the change of heat storageδu on reservoir evaporate rate the change of heat storage δu can significantly affect reservoir evaporation rate especially for deep reservoirs depth greater than 3 m to investigate the impact of δu on reservoir evaporate rate the evaporation rate was calculated with and without considering δu respectively compared with the evaporation rate calculated without δu the evaporation rate calculated with δu had clear lag times fig 9 the estimated lag time was calculated in two steps 1 the correlations between the evaporation rates calculated with and without δu at all possible lag times were calculated the possible lag times in this study is set from 0 to 12 months 2 the estimated lag time was the lag time corresponding to the largest value among these correlations fig 9 a to g show the two types of evaporation rates from 1985 to 2018 with a lag time of 0 to 6 months respectively among the 916 reservoirs the numbers of reservoirs with a lag time from 0 to 6 months were 42 48 160 454 183 17 and 12 respectively fig 9 h the mean lag time for the 916 reservoirs was 2 9 months additionally the average annual evaporation rate without δu is greater than the average annual evaporation rate with δu fig 9 a g this indicates that δu must be considered in calculating the reservoir evaporation rate in addition the relationship between the net radiation rn and δu was investigated the significant positive correlation was found between rn and δu r 0 71 p 0 01 thus δu can be approximately estimated by rn when other meteorological elements are not available fig 10 4 4 uncertainty there are uncertainties in the estimation of reservoir evaporation in this study first the reservoir evaporation rate cannot simulate ice sublimation reservoir surface would freeze when ta descends below 0 c this mainly happens in the winter in high latitude area such as northeast china therefore the reservoir evaporation rate of the shrb and lrb may be inaccurately estimated there are 78 reservoirs 68 10 in these two major river basins accounting for 8 2 of the total 916 reservoirs the uncertainty of evaporation volumes in these 78 reservoirs would not have much impact on the overall evaporation estimation of the 916 reservoirs to accurately estimate the evaporation rate in high latitudes ice sublimation process should be considered in the future second the meteorological data used to calculate evaporation has uncertainty the meteorological data is obtained from terraclimate dataset terraclimate dataset is developed based on japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 project climate research unit time series data version 4 0 cru ts4 0 and worldclim dataset abatzoglou et al 2018 uncertainties in the three datasets such as inhomogeneities in cru ts4 0 and jra 55 are entrained into terraclimate abatzoglou et al 2018 these may cause some uncertainty in evaporation estimations third a single forcing data may bring uncertainty in the estimation of evaporation rate and volume to explore this uncertainty two other datasets namely cmfd and era5 were used as forcing data to calculate evaporation rates fig 11 the average annual evaporation rates calculated with the three forcing datasets namely terraclimate cmfd and era5 were 2 7 mm d 2 3 mm d and 2 5 mm d from 1985 to 2018 respectively the average annual evaporation rates calculated with the three forcing datasets namely terraclimate cmfd and era5 were 2 7 mm d 2 3 mm d and 2 5 mm d from 1985 to 2018 respectively the annual evaporation rates calculated with the three forcing data all showed significant increasing trends with the values of 5 5 10 3 mm d a 4 8 10 3 mm d a and 6 0 10 3 mm d a respectively the annual evaporation volumes calculated with the three forcing datasets were 10 6 109 m3 9 2 109 m3 and 10 0 109 m3 from 1985 to 2018 respectively the annual evaporation volumes calculated with the three forcing datasets all showed significant increasing trends with the values of 2 0 108 m3 a 1 7 108 m3 a and 1 9 108 m3 a respectively thus using a single forcing dataset did not bring large uncertainty to the estimation of total reservoir evaporation volume in this study 4 5 potential applications the study provides a useful reference for water resources management in china first the accurate estimation of reservoir evaporation volume could help to accurately estimate available water resources for a reservoir precipitation inflow and outflow can be accurately observed once reservoir evaporation is accurately estimated available water resources can be accurately obtained zhang et al 2019b this can help managers allocate water resources more reasonably second accurate estimation of reservoir evaporation volume could help to estimate water saving efficiency in arid and semi arid regions water resources managers usually place different covers on the water surface to reduce evaporation because of huge reservoir evaporation loss the water saving efficiency can be calculated based on the calculated reservoir evaporation and the observed evaporation under different covers yao et al 2010 which helps to select suitable covers for reducing reservoir evaporation 5 conclusions this study estimated monthly reservoir evaporation for the 916 large reservoirs in china from 1985 to 2018 using the grsad and the penman equation the magnitudes and trends of reservoir surface area evaporation rate and reservoir evaporation volume were analyzed for the 916 reservoirs as a whole the total reservoir evaporation volume from 1985 to 2018 showed a significant p 0 05 increasing trend with a value of 2 0 108 m3 a the increase is due to significant increases p 0 05 in reservoir surface area and evaporation rate from 1985 to 2018 with a value of 186 1 km2 a and 0 006 mm d a respectively the largest total reservoir evaporation volume was 142 9 108 m3 in 2017 which is about 1 1 times the amount of water transferred in the middle route of the south to north water transfer project in china for the ten major river basins the yzrb had the largest total reservoir evaporation volume with 45 8 108 m3 in 2018 accounting for 32 7 of the total reservoir evaporation volume of china the yzrb also had the largest increasing trend in total reservoir evaporation volume with a value of 74 4 106 m3 a the results provide a useful reference for water resources management and reservoir design in china

4734,this manuscript outlines a methodological framework for modelling the hydrological impacts of future coal mining and coal seam gas extraction such impacts potentially include changes to both high flow and low flow characteristics such as total volume high flow rate and frequency low flow rate and frequency and cease to flow frequency in particular the manuscript proposes a methodology that is suitable for the prediction of cumulative impacts from multiple coal resource developments and for making such predictions at multiple locations in the landscape the proposed methodology is framed in terms of a structured uncertainty analysis to provide information on the likelihood and potential ranges of various impacts the approach can be applied under a wide range of data availability even when there is little to no observed data whilst additional data can easily be incorporated to better constrain the results the assessments thus derived can provide regulators with crucial objective information on the potential social economic environmental and ecological risks of future developments whilst discussed here in terms of coal resource development this methodology has the potential to be readily adapted and applied to a range of extractive industries including but not limited to minerals and other sources of unconventional gas as it stands the methodology does not explicitly consider impacts on water quality but could be extended to include this if required keywords hydrological modelling coal mining coal seam gas extraction cumulative impacts 1 introduction 1 1 literature review coal has been widely used around the world as a fuel source for transport and industry in manufacturing and to generate electricity extraction methods for coal include surface and underground mining surface mining also known as open cut open cast or mountaintop removal mining is preferred for seams that occur sufficiently close to the land surface that it is economical to remove the overburden to access the seam deeper coal seams require underground mining and this is typically achieved by longwall or bord and pillar methods longwall mining features the controlled collapse of overlying rock once the coal has been extracted booth 2006 in recent decades the commercial extraction from coal seams of adsorbed methane also known as coal seam gas or coalbed methane has increased around the world this is typically achieved by drilling wells to intersect the target seam and sometimes requires hydraulic fracturing to stimulate gas flow coal mining and coal seam gas extraction can result in a number of adverse hydrological and environmental consequences these potentially include changes to surface topography groundwater levels and connectivity the soil profile vegetation cover water quantity and quality and air quality coal mining has the potential to significantly disrupt downstream flow regimes and in the most severe cases can lead to the permanent loss of ephemeral intermittent and perennial headwater streams usepa 2011 furthermore coal mining produces significant amounts of waste material overburden spoil tailings that is usually stored on site and the interactions of this waste with incidental water can give rise to increased erosion acid mine drainage and high concentrations of dissolved solids and can seep into waterways and aquifers younger and wolkersdorfer 2004 bian et al 2010 such changes to water quality and hydrological regimes often impact ecological communities adversely a recent meta analysis of studies of ecological impacts of surface coal mining in the united states found substantial average reductions in taxonomic richness and biotic abundance in streams affected by coal mining giam et al 2018 and that these biodiversity impacts persist even after site remediation a meta analysis of coal mine impacts in new zealand showed decreased species richness and changed community composition in mine impacted streams clapcott et al 2016 biotic change was correlated with time post mining mining density and mining intensity bernhardt et al 2012 showed that critical thresholds for biological impairment are likely to arise where surface coal mines in the eastern united states occupy more than 5 4 of their contributing catchment area while many of the detrimental impacts of coal mining can be minimised or even avoided through following best practice there is still a need for strategic planning assessments to understand what these detrimental impacts may be there are several frameworks in the literature outlining overarching modelling approaches for assessing the impacts of coal mining e g lechner et al 2017 mcintyre et al 2018 such frameworks tend to feature the integration of multi disciplinary aspects of mining including social economic geochemical hydrological and ecological impacts whilst hydrological modelling is a key component of these frameworks it is typically not dealt with in any detail some hydrological modelling frameworks have been proposed for assessing impacts of land use change in general e g mcintyre et al 2014 but there does not appear to be a comprehensive modelling framework that looks in detail at the specific hydrological challenges presented by coal resource development ping et al 2017 used mike she to evaluate the impact of coal mining on river flows in a 1584 km2 catchment in china they calibrated the model to pre mine conditions using one response gauge and a monthly time step then compared simulations during a subsequent mining period with observed river flows the results suggest that each ton of raw coal reduces annual river flow by 2 87 m3 8 of which is due to reductions in surface runoff and 92 due to reductions in baseflow we note that the reliance of this methodology on observed flows means that it is not amenable to prediction of future developments a similar methodology using the yrwbm model was reported by guo et al 2017 and suggested an average annual flow reduction of about 60 in a large catchment with a surface coal mine coverage of about 29 1 2 aims this paper discusses options for modelling the impacts on local and regional streamflow characteristics of existing or potential future coal developments particularly coal mining and coal seam gas extraction in doing this the modelling framework developed here makes a number of assumptions about the modelling environment and its constraints implicit in this is the need to assess the differences in streamflow between two development scenarios one that incorporates the mining developments and one that does not assuming suitable future climate inputs are available this approach can readily be extended to assess the impacts of any potential future coal developments these impacts can be assessed against a baseline scenario without coal developments or one that includes existing coal operations several studies have demonstrated that the hydrological impact of coal mining is proportional to the upstream areal extent of mining e g petty et al 2010 bernhardt and palmer 2011 lindberg et al 2011 an implication of this is that the presence of multiple mines in a catchment is likely to have a more substantial impact on the catchment s water resources than a single mine in the united states coal mining approvals are often issued without consideration of the impacts of existing adjacent mines lindberg et al 2011 in australia mine proposals are usually required to address the issue of such cumulative impacts franks et al 2010 although this requirement is not always adhered to franks et al 2010 grech et al 2016 in some other regions of the world illegal coal mining is prevalent dutu 2016 cherdantsev and thurner 2017 and is unlikely to be subject to any environmental regulation or any recognition of cumulative impacts another objective of the modelling framework is therefore that it should be capable of predicting the cumulative impacts of multiple developments in doing so it should provide predictions of hydrological change at multiple locations where the impacts may potentially be felt both in the vicinity of the developments and further downstream this change may include several characteristics of the flow regime including but not limited to total volume high flow rate and frequency low flow rate and frequency and cease to flow frequency the quantification of change in a number of flow metrics allows the possibility of assessment of the impact of coal developments on water dependent systems these might include water availability for irrigation industry or water supply water quality and potential impacts on the sustainability and ongoing viability of water dependent ecosystems and the plant and animal species that depend on them taken together these dependencies along with predictions of water availability and their associated uncertainties can provide regulators with crucial objective information on the potential social economic environmental and ecological risks of future developments this information can be used to inform decisions on the licensing of proposed developments and on the types and ranges of conditions that might be attached to such licences while deterministic predictions of hydrological change are useful regulators will often be interested in knowing the range of potential impacts so it is ideal that the impacts be framed in some kind of uncertainty structure here we do this through considering the range of likely parameter values associated with all model inputs and report model results via the 10th 50th and 90th percentile of model outputs post et al 2020 community confidence in the results can be increased by making all data model inputs and outputs publicly accessible in a transparent way this also aids in the reproducibility and repeatability of the work this paper seeks to flesh out a surface water modelling framework that is suitable for meeting these objectives and assumptions in doing so it is complementary to the overarching frameworks of lechner et al 2017 and mcintyre et al 2018 it does not explicitly deal in detail with options for the modelling of groundwater mediated changes in surface flow important though these are but assumes that information on such changes is provided separately by a suitable and possibly coupled groundwater model as described in peeters et al 2018 or sreekanth et al 2020 nor does it canvass options for modelling changes in water quality 2 impacts of coal resource development on water resources the coal resource developments considered here include surface and underground coal mining and coal seam gas extraction while there are many similarities in how these different types of extractive industries manage water and how this affects streamflow generation there are also differences between types of industry and their impacts may be highly site specific the impacts of coal resource development on downstream flow conditions depend on the combination of factors that may enhance or deplete that flow these factors include extraction method water management regime waste disposal approach and hydrogeological setting some combinations of factors lead to increased storm runoff and increases in the frequency and magnitude of flooding e g ferrari et al 2009 miller and zégre 2014 while others lead to groundwater drawdown and declining streamflows jankowski and knights 2010 qiao et al 2011 the specific activities that may affect streamflow and water quality in receiving waters include coal seam dewatering hydraulic fracturing interception of surface runoff extraction of water from streams or groundwater disposal of mine water and co produced water longwall coal extraction and void collapse spoil disposal and diversion of upstream watercourses the ways in which these can impact streamflow are depicted in fig 1 the remainder of this section will provide a more detailed description of each of these activities and their potential impacts on streamflow note that for the purposes of this paper we are considering impacts that occur during the life of a mine post mining reclamation and rehabilitation is not considered explicitly 2 1 coal seam dewatering the dewatering of coal mines and depressurisation of coal seam gas fields leads to decreases in local groundwater levels and induces flow into the pumped coal seam thus necessitating continued pumping the spatial extent of the ensuing groundwater drawdown cone depends on the hydraulic conductivity and storativity of the layers the head changes caused by depressurisation of a target coal seam may be transmitted to other rock strata the magnitude and timing of any head change depends on the hydraulic properties of the affected strata zhao et al 2017 in general these changes are expected to be larger or faster in areas of faulting or fracturing zhao et al 2017 in particular dewatering and depressurisation may also affect alluvial aquifers possibly altering or reversing flow gradients between rivers and aquifers and potentially reducing the discharge of baseflow from the groundwater to a connected stream sun et al 2020 any enhanced inter aquifer connectivity see section 2 2 creates potential for water quality degradation both in the aquifers themselves and in any water discharged from them to adjacent waterbodies 2 2 hydraulic fracturing many coal seams feature sufficient natural fracturing to stimulate the production of gas without further fracturing however other seams may have lower permeability and require artificial fracturing to induce commercially viable rates of gas flow this fracturing is achieved through the high pressure injection of a fluid containing water various proppants such as sand and other chemical additives some of this fracturing fluid may be returned to the surface along with water produced during depressurisation hydraulic fracturing of coal seam gas wells may potentially alter inter aquifer connectivity and preferential flow paths mallants et al 2018 some of the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing may impair groundwater quality and may compromise the quality of any co produced water that is pumped out of the wells after fracturing elliott et al 2017 2 3 interception of surface runoff an open cut coal mine is likely to cause significant change to surface cover and vegetation this in turn is likely to lead to reductions in canopy interception of rainfall and in soil infiltration capacities infiltration might also be reduced by compaction associated with the use of heavy machinery thus there is likely to be an increase in surface runoff being generated on the disturbed area furthermore the amount of interception i e the size of the mine s physical footprint is likely to change considerably over time increasing as the mine develops and expands and decreasing during mine site remediation the impact this increased surface water has on downstream flow depends on the licensing conditions the mine is operating under in australia it is usual for coal mines to be required to retain on site any surface runoff that is generated on site nsw government 2015 this leads to reductions in streamflow downstream in comparison with the natural pre mine flows however in areas without such license restrictions e g the appalachian coalfields of the united states surface runoff is allowed to discharge into the streams either directly or via sediment ponds thus leading to an increase to the natural flows in downstream waters particularly in peak flows and storm event runoff bernhardt and palmer 2011 evans et al 2015 2 4 extraction of water from streams or groundwater water is a crucial component in coal mining and coal processing fresh water is sourced from streams groundwater or other water bodies overton 2020 and is used for a variety of purposes including to reduce the fire hazard in underground mines coal washing dust suppression and cooling cutting surfaces we note that there may be some regions or jurisdictions where direct extraction is only allowed through the purchase of licences from existing water users this situation is prevalent in australia where mines are often developed in areas of longstanding irrigated agricultural activity such as the hunter valley and namoi regions of nsw overton 2020 extraction through this mechanism might not substantially change the total extraction by all users from the stream but it might alter its timing and location 2 5 disposal of mine water and co produced water water sourced from groundwater pumping interception of surface runoff or extraction from streams may be temporarily stored on site there are a number of potential fates for this water some of it is likely to be used on site for coal washing dust suppression etc in some developments such as those in the upper hunter valley of nsw the water may be used for irrigation of on site or nearby crops mercuri et al 2005 navi et al 2015 list a range of uses of co produced water from coal seam gas developments in australia and the united states including irrigation livestock watering environmental flow augmentation domestic and industrial uses fire protection power generation groundwater recharge dust suppression aquaculture and snow making in some developments produced water may be left indefinitely in storage to evaporate although this is becoming much less common in australia particularly in queensland where the practice is essentially banned ehp 2012 the water or more commonly concentrated brine may be transported off site some developments may be licensed to discharge water directly to the stream network in the latter case this discharge may be strictly regulated and only allowed during favourable conditions northey et al 2016 such conditions might be when natural river flows are high and the discharge is not likely to significantly affect the quality of the river flows in some jurisdictions such as the hunter valley of nsw where a salinity trading scheme is in effect the discharge of stored water is regulated by a permit system in which mining companies buy discharge permits at auction and are allowed to trade permits with other producers franks et al 2010 2 6 longwall coal extraction and void collapse subsidence of material above a longwall coal mine has the potential to change the surface landscape to such an extent that the generation of surface runoff or its flow paths are altered these changes may in turn alter the hydrology of nearby wetlands subsidence has been reported to cause alterations in surface elevation of up to 2 m in the united states darmody 1998 and australia hinchliffe 2003 gullo 2006 and up to 3 4 m in china hu and gu 1995 subsidence is generally restricted to a distance of up to several hundred metres from the collapsed panel while the associated horizontal displacements may extend for several kilometres from the mine workings krogh 2007 subsidence may also result in increased surface ponding which will in turn mean that some runoff water could evaporate or recharge rather than reach the natural drainage network furthermore surface cracking as a consequence of subsidence may also lead to increased recharge and reduced runoff and has been implicated in the reduction and possible loss of flow in overlying streams and in the draining of wetlands krogh 2007 jankowski and knights 2010 lechner et al 2016 subsidence also has the potential to increase baseflow by altering the hydraulic conductivity of the layers above long wall panels herron et al 2018 some of the potential impacts of subsidence on hydrology can be ameliorated by channelling or recontouring the landscape lechner et al 2016 in some jurisdictions underground mining companies may be required to adopt such mitigation strategies 2 7 spoil disposal most coal mining produces substantial quantities of overburden and interburden the non economic material spoil that must be removed to access the coal seams this spoil is usually stored in designated spoil heaps on or adjacent to the mine site often this spoil will be used in post mining reclamation to recontour the mined landscape in jurisdictions such as australia where the spoil is kept on the mine site its impact on downstream flow is minimal except to the extent that it comprises part of the mine footprint area from which surface water is prevented from leaving except in specified circumstances however in other parts of the world the spoil heap may have significant impacts on downstream flow a common form of surface coal mining in parts of the united states is mountaintop mining with valley fills palmer et al 2010 this method involves the removal of coal seams running through a mountain or ridge with the associated overburden being pushed into adjacent valleys often burying existing stream reaches that may be several kilometres in length peng 2000 valley filling thus fundamentally alters the natural flow conditions and the riverine ecosystems that depend on them furthermore water emerging from the base of valley fills after percolating through the unconsolidated spoil is typically contaminated with dissolved solids and salts acids and metals associated with the weathering of the newly exposed strata or from the mining process itself hartman et al 2005 pond et al 2008 2 8 diversion of upstream watercourses the management of upstream water entering a mine site may vary depending on jurisdiction and licensing conditions in some places surface runoff from outside the footprint of the disturbed area is likely to be diverted around and past the mine site this is unlikely to cause significant change to the volume or timing of water reaching the downstream receiving waters elsewhere upstream flow might pass through the spoil areas of the mine site and temporarily be directed into sediment ponds merricks et al 2007 under these conditions the total volume of flow contributing to downstream rivers is likely to decrease and its timing and quality are likely to be affected 3 considerations affecting model structure and choice 3 1 data constraints approaches to modelling the impacts of coal resource development on streamflow can be constrained by data availability this is particularly true where model calibration is required the temporal and spatial scales of streamflow modelling are dictated largely by the temporal and spatial scales of the available meteorological input data traditionally meteorological data is derived from point measurements with appropriate spatial interpolation and extrapolation where required however there has been a trend in recent years towards the development of gridded climate data that is suitable for use in hydrological modelling ledesma and futter 2017 an example is the australian silo daily rainfall and climate data vaze et al 2011 jeffrey et al 2001 which are available as 0 05 0 05 degree approximately 5 km rasters it follows that in modelling conducted with this data set the smallest temporal element will be one day and the smallest spatial element will be 0 05 degrees however this raw spatial scale does not preclude modelling at finer spatial scales through interpolation and nor does it preclude the assessment of the impacts of coal resource developments with sub pixel extents similarly model choices might be constrained by the spatial and temporal resolutions of any response data that is used for model calibration in many situations there may be no suitable local response data available for model calibration and the modeller may have to make use of data and calibrated parameters from nearby representative catchments 3 2 considerations in streamflow modelling streamflow models take input from meteorological data primarily rainfall and potential evaporation and produce inflows to the stream network almost all streamflow models contain parameters with unknown values which must be estimated by calibration this calibration is usually done by comparing predicted streamflows with those observed at streamflow gauging stations the major challenge in streamflow modelling is to produce credible predictions of streamflow in ungauged parts of the modelling domain sivapalan 2003 this usually involves the estimation of appropriate model parameters to use in those parts of the landscape this process of parameter estimation in the absence of direct calibration is called regionalisation there are two broad categories of regionalisation one involves using parameter values from a gauged catchment that is considered to share similar characteristics climate soils vegetation etc to the ungauged area often it is found that the simple expedient of using parameters from the nearest gauged catchment is among the best regionalisation methods e g oudin et al 2008 implicit in this nearest neighbour approach is the assumption that catchments in close proximity are likely to share similar physical and hydrological characteristics and that therefore optimal models of each of them will also share similar parameter values however there is a significant degradation in model performance with this type of regionalisation as regionalisation distance increases viney et al 2014 the prediction performance of proximal regionalisation can also be dominated by locally anomalous calibration catchments the second regionalisation approach involves multi objective calibration of a model using observations from several nearby gauging stations in this approach the calibration procedure uses a single objective function that combines the prediction responses in all gauged catchments and results in a single set of model parameter values that provide best fit to the streamflow observations from all gauges the key assumption here is that if a single set of parameter values provides good predictions in the gauged catchments it might also be expected to provide good predictions in adjacent ungauged areas this regionalisation approach is called regional calibration peel and blöschl 2011 unlike nearest neighbour calibration the performance of regionally calibrated models does not degrade with distance from the calibration catchments and the effects of poor quality streamflow records are diminished viney et al 2014 regional calibration requires that all significant sources of spatial variability are accounted for in the model at a minimum this requires spatial distribution of climate inputs but ideally also includes spatial variability in land cover and perhaps soil properties and topography regional calibration requires a model with two key characteristics the first requirement is that the model be capable of making spatially explicit predictions of streamflow a simple bucket model is not suitable without substantial spatialisation the second necessity is a model structure that represents the impacts of these sources of spatial variability in a way that is independent of the set of optimisable parameters such a structure might be one based on hydrological response units e g leavesley and stannard 1995 or one based on explicit input of land cover or vegetation density information e g sivapalan et al 2002 the desire for a model capable of predicting the cumulative impacts of multiple developments also points to the need for a model that can make predictions at multiple locations it is crucial that these predictions involve a consistent and coherent distributed response this points strongly towards regional calibration and the use of a semi distributed model with global i e unvarying over the model domain optimisable parameters prediction of change in hydrological systems is usually achieved either through using changed inputs e g a changed climate series or through using altered parameter values to reflect changed catchment conditions seibert and van meerveld 2016 the latter approach is required for predicting change impacts of coal resource development however where long time period realisations are being considered it may be prudent to also accommodate potential changes in climate input chiew et al 2018 3 3 linkages with groundwater modelling several of the flow pathways depicted in fig 1 cannot be adequately quantified using a typical surface water model they instead require the application of a dedicated groundwater model in particular these pathways include the effects of groundwater extraction which is common to coal seam gas extraction and to both surface and underground mining and of the controlled collapse of underground voids there are several modelling packages that integrate groundwater and surface water such as gsflow mike she and cathy bizhanimanzar et al 2020 some of these have the potential to circumvent or simplify coupling issues however here we consider the more general case of distinct surface water and groundwater models which may in any case have advantages in terms of pragmatism and applicability at appropriate scales this manuscript assumes that appropriate quantification of these groundwater mediated fluxes and associated uncertainty is available from a groundwater model or a cascading suite of groundwater models and does not further discuss the technical details of how those fluxes might be obtained for a discussion of a suitable groundwater modelling framework for coal resources the reader is referred to crosbie et al 2016 there is however a need for those fluxes to be coupled directly or indirectly with the surface water model the groundwater models possibly including both a regional model and an alluvial model and the surface water models possibly including both a landscape model and a river system model need to pass information between each other considerable care is required in designing how this is achieved this is particularly true when considering the need to run models for different levels of coal resource development and the need to accommodate the various post processing steps there are three principal coupling points between surface water and groundwater models the first is that river stage heights generated by the surface water model are used to provide boundary conditions to the groundwater model secondly a groundwater model may require estimates of the temporal distribution of recharge to groundwater these estimates can be obtained from a suitable surface water model but may require scaling to a longer timestep for use in a groundwater model crosbie et al 2015 thirdly the exchange fluxes between groundwater and the river are calculated in the groundwater model and passed back to the surface water model as changes in baseflow generation while most surface water models include a baseflow groundwater flow term it is unlikely that this will be capable of adequately quantifying the changes in groundwater flux associated with mining induced changes in groundwater levels and gradients in general these points of commonality between surface water and groundwater models argue strongly in favour of the two components being developed concurrently for a particular application 3 4 accounting for water regulation and management water regulation and management is not usually accounted for in a conventional surface water model where it has a significant impact on streamflow it will be advantageous to propagate the flows generated by the surface water model through a suitably constructed river routing model a river routing model typically uses a node link concept where a river system is schematized into a simplified river network using a node link structure the river network begins and ends with a node and all nodes are interconnected by links a link is used for transfer of flow between two nodes with routing runoff from gauged or ungauged tributaries or the local contributing area between two nodes is fed into the connecting link as an inflow at the relevant location all other physical processes such as diversions groundwater fluxes overbank flow occurring between the two nodes are incorporated in the link dutta et al 2013 components of the river water balance computed by a river routing model might include a routing scheme demand modelling e g for irrigation or other consumptive uses storage management e g dam volumes and releases floodplain dynamics interactions between surface water and groundwater a river routing model typically requires calibration and this needs to be done against daily streamflow observations at a number of gauging stations within the basin it is preferable but not crucial that this calibration period coincide with that used for calibration of the rainfall runoff model of the components depicted in fig 1 a river routing model could be employed to introduce and propagate flows associated with managed extractions and discharges to the stream on site storage and flowpath redirection 4 putting it all together 4 1 how to define a future the focus of this manuscript is on assessing the potential future hydrological impacts of proposed coal resource developments these developments may occur against a background of past and currently active coal mines and coal seam gas fields in other words there may be pre existing developments that have already changed the local hydrological regime from its original state we are interested therefore in quantifying how much further change beyond that which has already occurred that the proposed developments might induce in general terms we identify three futures or scenarios one which we call the undeveloped scenario is a simulation of the hydrological regime that would prevail in the absence of any coal resource development a second scenario which we call the baseline future encompasses the impact which may be ongoing of existing developments the third scenario the expansion future accounts for both pre existing and proposed developments it is important to recognise that agents of hydrological change other than those related to coal resource development may be active in the location of interest such factors might include land use changes such as urbanisation deforestation or changes in climate notwithstanding the fact that surface mining also represents a significant land use change it is not unreasonable to assume that other non mining land use changes are common to all three scenarios acknowledging that there may be other developments associated with mining e g urban development that are not considered here similarly it is reasonable to assume that the climate drivers while possibly changing over time will also be common to all three scenarios the ultimate objective is to provide insight into the differences in hydrology between the baseline and expansion futures the undeveloped scenario is included here to allow as described in subsequent subsections the possibility of using observed streamflow data from unaffected catchments in calibrating the models and in subsampling simulation replicates for uncertainty analysis 4 2 how and where to place model nodes the surface water nodes provide the key output locations for surface water modelling as such it is critical that node locations align with nodes in the river system models however it is also important to note that streamflow will often change only slowly with distance down a river this is particularly true in reaches with little lateral tributary inflow this means that predicted streamflow at a single output location can often provide appropriate predictions for a range of locations along a river reach in particular this single set of streamflow predictions may be well within the uncertainty limits of the surface water modelling in such environments a single model node may prove adequate even in quite long river reaches elsewhere in places where the density of model nodes is insufficient for impact modelling it may be feasible to interpolate streamflows to any new output location the surface water model nodes are the locations where streamflow predictions are made in general these nodes are located either at streamflow gauges above major confluences immediately below proposed coal mine and coal seam gas developments at locations required for impact modelling e g at ecologically sensitive or significant locations an example of node placement is shown in fig 2 note however that in principle model nodes can be placed anywhere in the stream network and are not limited to the examples described above 4 3 calibration why and what most surface water models include unknown parameter values and require calibration against observed streamflow data calibration seeks to ensure that the models are providing the best achievable predictions of the relevant flow metrics it should be noted that in the context of the prediction of the impacts of future coal resource developments a modelling application that relies on the difference between two scenarios places less rigorous demand on calibration than a conventional modelling setting this is because to some extent biases in model prediction will cancel out under differencing furthermore the need for identifying an optimal parameter set is further reduced in an uncertainty based modelling framework which samples from the feasible parameter space see section 4 6 although there is still a need to identify an appropriate prior and likelihood function associated with the feasible parameter space regional calibration of a spatially distributed model requires observed streamflow data from a number of gauging sites these sites do not necessarily have to be located within the modelling domain but should be representative of the climatic and hydrological regimes present in the modelling domain here we propose the use of a set of calibration catchments that are not impacted by coal resource development this allows the generation of predictions in the modelling domain of an undeveloped future criteria for selecting the catchments for calibrating a runoff model might include that they have catchment areas that are broadly commensurate with or greater than the subcatchments of the modelling domain have recent long term measurements preferably more than 20 years and preferably including wet and dry periods are currently not impacted by coal mining or coal seam gas extraction or other major extractive industries have no significant flow regulation e g dams are not nested i e not directly upstream or downstream of another selected gauge are located within or close to the region of interest and have similar hydrological and climatic regimes a suitable objective function for a regional calibration is one that combines the goodness of fit measures from all or most of the calibration catchments the goodness of fit measures are often based around the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 or the prediction bias viney et al 2009 it is noted that efficiency based optimisation typically leads to parameter sets that are biased towards high flow prediction even though high flow events are typically underestimated mizukami et al 2019 it is notoriously difficult for any optimisation scheme to simultaneously enable strong predictions of both high flow and low flow characteristics typically an emphasis on optimising predictions at one end of the flow range will compromise predictions at the other end however the impacts of coal resource development on surface hydrology are likely to have impacts on both high flow and low flow characteristics for this reason we propose the use of two separate calibration runs one biased towards high flows and one biased towards low flows the latter can be achieved by using an efficiency based objective function with a box cox transformation box and cox 1964 or by adopting specifically developed low flow metrics the two parameter sets need not necessarily be used directly in predicting the hydrological changes associated with coal resource development but they can be used as a guide in selecting samples for an uncertainty analysis as described in section 4 6 4 4 incorporating the impacts of coal mining and coal seam gas extraction 4 4 1 changes in baseflow as outlined in section 3 3 a stand alone surface water model is unlikely to be capable of accurately estimating changes in baseflow discharge associated with groundwater extraction and depressurisation in the absence of a fully integrated surface water groundwater modelling framework changes in baseflow in fig 1 are introduced into the surface water model as output from a groundwater model as described in section 4 5 4 4 2 changes in surface runoff generation potential changes in surface runoff generation can occur through several mechanisms and appropriate methods for dealing with them depend in part on what controls the proponent puts in place to minimise them development of a mine site is almost certain to change the nature of the land surface for example the disturbed area might be converted from deep rooted forest to bare soil or short rooted vegetation such a conversion is likely to cause changes in the way the landscape processes incident precipitation including changes in canopy interception infiltration and evapotranspiration in general terms then a surface water model is required that has the capability to modify the relevant surface fluxes either through altered parameter values or through modification to the prevailing hydrological response unit in practice accurate specification of these modifications may be difficult but can be guided by observation a special case of surface runoff change occurs where coal mines are prevented by legislation from allowing any surface water to discharge from the mine site in these circumstances changes in surface runoff can be modelled simply as reductions in runoff that are proportional to the area of disturbance increased ponding associated with land subsidence due to longwall mining has the potential to decrease runoff from overlying surfaces that may be otherwise unaffected by vegetation removal and other surface modification the change in runoff from a catchment containing an underground operation is likely to be proportional to the area subject to longwall collapse however it is not clear what value that proportionality constant should take and there does not appear to be any guidance in the literature see for example the review commissioned by the iesc commonwealth of australia 2015 in part this is because mine proponents have the capacity to ameliorate or at least partly ameliorate the impacts of ponding by preventing land subsidence and or introducing contouring of the land surface proportionality constants are sometimes estimated by proponents and published in mine planning documents for australian longwall mines a proportionality constant taking account of amelioration practices of about 5 of the area above longwall panels is often adopted in mine planning documents pers comm this proportion gives the amount by which surface runoff above collapsed longwall panels may be reduced below natural levels 4 4 3 extraction of water from streams or groundwater where there is a proposal for a mine or gas field to extract water directly from the stream network it will seldom be possible to model the decision making processes that lead to variations in the timing and volume of extractions instead a simpler approach requires the development and application of a suitable time series of extracted volumes such a time series will often be derivable from mine planning documents any such extractions can be subtracted from modelled flow in affected streams extraction of water from groundwater resources for mine use is equally difficult to model and for similar reasons again the modeller will need to develop a suitable input time series of the volume of groundwater extractions possibly derived from mine planning documents if extraction rates are unknown this is often modelled as a specified head boundary condition it should be noted that where extractive water use for a mine or gas field is in competition for a regulated finite resource with other licensed users e g irrigators industrial users then any increase in water take for the coal industry might be offset by concomitant reductions in water take by other users although the mine proponent may instead choose to provide compensation bores to existing users accessing different aquifers 4 4 4 disposal of produced water the impact of produced water on downstream flow is largely dependent on the nature and methods of disposal some disposal methods such as transporting the water off site have no local impact while other uses such as dust suppression and coal washing are likely to have negligible impacts on the volume of streamflow although impacts on water quality may be significant tasker et al 2018 the disposal methods that are likely to have the greatest impact on downstream flow are those associated with direct discharge to the stream network in a mining environment with unregulated discharges it is extremely difficult to assess the volumes and timings associated with such discharges and mine planning documents are unlikely to provide much guidance to the modeller in particular any conscious decisions related to auction and trade systems will not generally be readily amenable to inclusion in a hydrological modelling framework at best it may be possible to infer from modelled streamflow characteristics the timing and duration of any opportunistic discharges that arise in response to periods of high natural flow although these discharges may be partly subject to the whims of human decision making the volume of any such discharges is likely to be dependent on the amount and quality of water available for discharge and on the height and duration of the discharge window a discharge model built from observations of behaviour during previous discharge opportunities would appear to provide the most tractable way forward of course any unregulated discharges to the stream network that is those that take place due to accidents in defiance of or in the absence of any regulatory control are far more difficult to incorporate into any modelling framework the modeller must nonetheless be alert to the possibility that such discharges may be occurring and be open to considering ways of dealing with them within the model 4 4 5 other alterations to flow paths diversions of flow pathways caused by valley fill spoil disposal or bunding around tenements are unlikely to have significant impact on the volumes of flow in receiving waters at the scales of interest here 10 km2 or more unless they are associated with a major meso scale disruption to the drainage network they may however have significant impacts on the timing of streamflow as well as on water quality hartman et al 2005 if however flow is being diverted into an adjoining valley or catchment system it can readily be incorporated into the routing scheme of a semi distributed modelling system 4 5 model sequencing in the absence of a single coupled and integrated surface water routing and groundwater model considerable care is required in linking the three models in particular the stages of the process at which mining mediated changes are introduced needs to be carefully considered for a three scenario modelling strategy undeveloped baseline and expansion futures an example model sequence is shown in fig 3 this sequencing structure is appropriate for a mining regime in which all runoff generated on the mine site is retained in circumstances where runoff is allowed to leave the site and enter the natural stream network a different sequencing strategy may be appropriate the basic structure of fig 3 is of runoff and recharge output from the runoff model being passed to the routing model and stage height output from the latter being passed to the groundwater model there may be further iteration between the routing and groundwater models as baseflow adjustments from the latter are passed back to the former in this example since all runoff is retained on site mining related changes in surface runoff can be assumed to be directly proportional to the area of the mine footprint relative to that of the entire subcatchment no further modelling of surface runoff change is required the volumes and timings of extractions of water from the stream are largely driven by human decision making and are therefore very difficult to incorporate in a physical model nonetheless mine proponents are likely to have nominated typical stream water take rates in their mine planning documents and these rates can be prescribed in the model similarly the volumes and timings of discharges of water into the stream are partly driven by human decision making however they are also likely to be limited to specific prescribed high flow events whose occurrence and duration can be estimated from the output of the routing model the endpoint of the example in fig 3 is an estimation of the differences in streamflow metrics between the expansion and baseline futures the modelling scheme is thus focussed on the change in surface water statistics as a result of the expansion developments rather than on predicting the actual future surface water flow under a given development pathway 4 6 uncertainty there is a growing awareness of the difficulties and limitations of producing accurate deterministic forecasts of hydrological variables concomitantly there is an increasing demand from managers and stakeholders for probability based estimates of the likelihood of occurrence of certain events however despite this increasing awareness and recognition that quantification of uncertainty in model projections should be explicitly included in studies of hydrological change harmel et al 2014 most studies still rely on comparisons using a single best parameter set seibert and van meerveld 2016 uncertainty in hydrological modelling arises from three main sources data uncertainty which includes uncertainty in input data and in calibration data structural model uncertainty and parameter uncertainty the first two of these can be difficult to identify and quantify renard et al 2010 here we focus on parameter uncertainty which derives from spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the model domain and may be influenced by temporal variability in meteorological conditions or by spatial variability in surface and subsurface properties parameter uncertainty is thus reflective of uncertainties in both input and calibration data and also in process descriptions and model approximations as such parameter uncertainty may be considered as a partial integrator of all three uncertainty sources we advocate for an uncertainty approach that focuses on finding a comprehensive range of parameter combinations that provide predictions that are plausibly consistent with the relevant observations relevant observations are those that are able to constrain the parameters to which the predictions are sensitive and are preferably of the same type as the prediction metrics that are considered to be important for quantifying the potential social economic environmental and ecological risks of future developments the resulting distribution of the prediction is then considered to be the estimate of uncertainty of the hydrological response variable such an approach might proceed as follows 1 perform a sensitivity analysis e g peeters et al 2018 to identify the parameters that are most sensitive for some or most of the relevant hydrological response variables 2 establish prior distributions of each sensitive parameter that are biased towards the calibration results 3 sample from the prior distributions and compare the resulting simulations against a suite of relevant observational metrics 4 choose a subset of the parameter sets perhaps the best 10 as determined by comparison with observations to represent the uncertainty in the predictions the first step of this approach merely eliminates from further consideration any parameter that is found to have little influence on the predictions in other words any uncertainty in the value of such a parameter does not lead to significant uncertainty in the predictions the second step makes use of the calibrated parameter values to construct prior distributions that are more likely to give rise to reasonable predictions than an unbiased i e uniform distribution would the calibrated parameter values represent an optimal parameter set traditional modelling approaches would simply use these optimal parameter values run the model and report the results without any consideration of uncertainties in these parameter values while we eschew this approach there is arguably useful information in the optimal parameter values and thus we use this information to bias the range of potential parameter values towards this optimal parameter set the range of potential parameter values in the distribution can be set to be quite wide it is not essential that the parameter range is the best estimate of the uncertainty of the parameter it is sufficient for the range to be plausible and realistic in the case where two or more sets of calibrated parameters are available and represent different aspects of the hydrograph as proposed in section 4 3 the prior distribution should be biased towards giving higher weighting to parameter values near to some measure of central tendency in the calibrated parameter values the variance of the calibrated parameter values should be reflected in the shape parameter of the prior distribution an example of this approach is illustrated in fig 4 where a beta distribution is used to establish prior parameter distributions from two sets of calibration parameters notionally these might be a set of parameters that reflects high flow response and another set of parameters that reflects low flow response the mean of each distribution is taken as the mean of the parameter values in the two calibrations and the variance spread of the distribution reflects the similarity or divergence of the two values where the two calibrations yield similar parameter values e g fig 4a and b the beta distribution is narrower than for calibrations with dissimilar parameter values fig 4c and d the parameter values on the horizontal axes in fig 4 are normalised to the range 0 1 where a parameter is suspected to behave in a logarithmic manner that is where there is significant sensitivity in model output as the parameter value approaches zero the beta distribution can be log transformed before it is normalised the parameter bounds represented by the parameter fractiles should be relatively wide whilst infeasible parameter values should be avoided there is no reason why values that lie outside the modeller s expectation cannot be included in the range of the prior distribution the third step of the uncertainty approach is to run a large number of model simulations using parameter values sampled from their respective beta distributions the output from these simulations can be compared to observations preferably using a combination of the types of observations e g high flow metrics low flow metrics that are appropriate for the application these model simulations with randomly sampled parameters inevitably result in a significant number of poor predictions this is to be expected when sampling from wide parameter bounds furthermore parameter correlation issues can lead to simulations that use infeasible combinations of parameter values and these too can compromise prediction accuracy in step four therefore it is suggested that a subset of the stochastic parameter sets those whose predictions best match the observations are selected the parameter values associated with this selection then provide the bases of the posterior parameter distributions the proportion of stochastic simulations to include in the posterior subset depends in part on the width of the prior parameter ranges and on the degree of parameter cross correlation but a proportion of around 10 is likely to provide a good balance between eliminating infeasible predictions and providing a satisfactory cohort for assessing prediction uncertainty however comprehensive the uncertainty quantification there will always be aspects of the chain of models that cannot be accounted for due to data availability constraints on time and budget or technical limitations the uncertainty quantification should therefore be complemented by a qualitative uncertainty analysis kloprogge et al 2011 peeters 2017 such a qualitative uncertainty analysis systematically discusses the assumptions and model choices made scores the extent to which the assumptions were affected by data availability budget and time constraints or technical limitations and most importantly assesses the extent to which the assumption may affect the predictions assumptions considered in this qualitative analysis include such things as the criteria for selecting calibration catchments choice of objective function and choice of likely coal resource development this qualitative uncertainty analysis aids in the communication to stakeholders about sources of uncertainty not accounted for in the uncertainty quantification and the degree to which they have the potential to affect the predictions 5 outputs and outcomes from streamflow modelling 5 1 output metrics it is important to establish well defined hydrological response variables explicitly defined in space and time that can be used to summarise the results of the numerical modelling and support reasoned explanations for the potential changes in the hydrologic regime these variables should be representative of the flow characteristics that are important for assessing impacts on economic and environmental assets ideally they might include a mix of metrics that describe low flow characteristics and high flow characteristics a large cohort of potential flow metrics has been proposed for assessing ecologically sensitive change in river flows kennard et al 2010 to quantify the changes in flow characteristics associated with resource extraction some of the important low flow metrics might include such variables as the number of zero flow days per year the first percentile of daily streamflow rates the number of days per year for which streamflow fails to exceed a low threshold the length of the longest continuous period each year in which streamflow fails to exceed a low threshold high flow metrics might include annual streamflow the 99th percentile of daily streamflow rates the number of days per year for which streamflow exceeds a high threshold streamflow modelling should enable these and other potential variables to be calculated quasi independently for each modelling node ideally the threshold based metrics could be tuned to the flow stages that are significant for hydrological or ecological function such thresholds might include those at which pool disconnection occurs low flows or at which overbench or overbank flow occurs high flows each of the output metrics can be calculated as an annual time series for both the baseline and expansion scenarios the difference between the two series for a given metric yields a direct measure of the impact of the expansion on the relevant streamflow characteristic it is relatively straightforward to find the year with the largest impact either in absolute or proportional terms and the magnitude of that change 5 2 interpretation of uncertainty in output metrics model runs derived from monte carlo sampling from the posterior parameter set yield a distribution of maximum impacts and a distribution of the time year of maximum impact for each node and for each flow metric the fifth and 95th percentiles of these output distributions can be interpreted as a measure of uncertainty in the predicted hydrological change an uncertainty scheme like this also allows the identification of a zone of potential hydrological change that is the spatial extent of significant impact associated with the developments in the expansion scenario a particular node or reach can be considered to be potentially impacted if there is a likelihood of significant change in any of the hydrological response variables in this context likelihood may be defined as a small probability say 5 of the maximum change exceeding a relatively conservative subjective threshold peeters et al 2018 for changes in streamflow characteristics a suitable threshold might be a small percentage change for volumetric flow variables or a small change in occurrence of frequency based variables this zone of potential hydrological change thus delineates an area within and likely downstream of the modelling domain that could be targeted for additional monitoring or for change mitigation strategies conversely given small exceedance probabilities and conservative thresholds it is reasonable to conclude that any part of the domain that is outside the zone of potential hydrological change that is there is a high probability that there is no significant impact to any of the hydrological response variables is likely to be unaffected by the resource development and may be safely ruled out from further detailed examination peeters et al 2018 suggest that the union of this surface water zone of potential hydrological change with a similar zone calculated for groundwater impacts e g using spatially explicit groundwater drawdown simulations can provide suitable spatial bounds for a whole of system zone of potential hydrological change 5 3 implications for ecological assessment changes in surface water hydrology associated with coal resource development form an integral part of the chain of interactions between the resource extraction activities and any potential impacts on water dependent ecosystems ecosystems may be affected directly by exposure to changes in the depth to water tables in the volume and permanence of streamflows or in the frequency and magnitude of inundation events bunn and arthington 2002 kennard et al 2010 it is important to recognise that any such impacts may be spread over time and may persist long after the mining activities that cause them have ceased it is also important to recognise that some impacts may be irreversible any water dependent species or ecosystem within the zone of potential hydrological change described in section 5 2 could be considered to be potentially affected positively or negatively by the resource development this does not mean that an impact is inevitable but rather based on the magnitude of the hydrological change the possibility of a significant impact exists and further investigation may be warranted while the current scientific understanding of the quantitative links between hydrological change and ecological response is poor vaughan et al 2009 wheeler et al 2018 some predictive models are emerging e g stratford et al 2016 rolls et al 2017 it is expected that such models will make increasing use of uncertainty in hydrological flows to inform uncertainty in ecological responses 6 conclusions this manuscript outlines a methodological framework for modelling the impacts of proposed coal mining and coal seam gas extraction on downstream river flows the methodology combines the direct impacts of changes in surface runoff generation the indirect impacts of changes in groundwater surface water interactions and the impacts of mine water management whilst discussed here in terms of coal resource development this methodology has the potential to be readily adapted and applied to a range of extractive industries including but not limited to minerals and other sources of unconventional gas we advocate for a semi distributed modelling scheme that allows for predictions of streamflow change at multiple locations within a modelling domain and which accounts for the cumulative effects of multiple coal mine and coal seam gas extraction developments the framework assesses the differences in streamflow between two development scenarios one that incorporates the mining developments and one that doesn t assessing the differences in hydrological response between different development scenarios but otherwise using common climate inputs can minimise the effects of data and calibration uncertainties the proposed methodology is framed in terms of a structured uncertainty analysis to provide information on the likelihoods and potential ranges of various impacts the assessments thus derived can provide regulators with crucial objective information on the potential social economic environmental and ecological risks of future developments the modelling framework described here does not explicitly include water quality it is acknowledged that water quality can play a major role in influencing the water mediated impacts of coal resource development especially those associated with ecological change water quality characteristics are critically dependent on the water fluxes either through the various water fluxes carrying with them soluble concentrations that are commensurate with the concentration of the respective water source or through particulate material carried by sediment transport processes this framework thus provides a suitable base for extension to the modelling of water quality issues example applications of the modelling framework described in this manuscript appear in a companion paper by viney et al 2021 declaration of competing interest the

4734,this manuscript outlines a methodological framework for modelling the hydrological impacts of future coal mining and coal seam gas extraction such impacts potentially include changes to both high flow and low flow characteristics such as total volume high flow rate and frequency low flow rate and frequency and cease to flow frequency in particular the manuscript proposes a methodology that is suitable for the prediction of cumulative impacts from multiple coal resource developments and for making such predictions at multiple locations in the landscape the proposed methodology is framed in terms of a structured uncertainty analysis to provide information on the likelihood and potential ranges of various impacts the approach can be applied under a wide range of data availability even when there is little to no observed data whilst additional data can easily be incorporated to better constrain the results the assessments thus derived can provide regulators with crucial objective information on the potential social economic environmental and ecological risks of future developments whilst discussed here in terms of coal resource development this methodology has the potential to be readily adapted and applied to a range of extractive industries including but not limited to minerals and other sources of unconventional gas as it stands the methodology does not explicitly consider impacts on water quality but could be extended to include this if required keywords hydrological modelling coal mining coal seam gas extraction cumulative impacts 1 introduction 1 1 literature review coal has been widely used around the world as a fuel source for transport and industry in manufacturing and to generate electricity extraction methods for coal include surface and underground mining surface mining also known as open cut open cast or mountaintop removal mining is preferred for seams that occur sufficiently close to the land surface that it is economical to remove the overburden to access the seam deeper coal seams require underground mining and this is typically achieved by longwall or bord and pillar methods longwall mining features the controlled collapse of overlying rock once the coal has been extracted booth 2006 in recent decades the commercial extraction from coal seams of adsorbed methane also known as coal seam gas or coalbed methane has increased around the world this is typically achieved by drilling wells to intersect the target seam and sometimes requires hydraulic fracturing to stimulate gas flow coal mining and coal seam gas extraction can result in a number of adverse hydrological and environmental consequences these potentially include changes to surface topography groundwater levels and connectivity the soil profile vegetation cover water quantity and quality and air quality coal mining has the potential to significantly disrupt downstream flow regimes and in the most severe cases can lead to the permanent loss of ephemeral intermittent and perennial headwater streams usepa 2011 furthermore coal mining produces significant amounts of waste material overburden spoil tailings that is usually stored on site and the interactions of this waste with incidental water can give rise to increased erosion acid mine drainage and high concentrations of dissolved solids and can seep into waterways and aquifers younger and wolkersdorfer 2004 bian et al 2010 such changes to water quality and hydrological regimes often impact ecological communities adversely a recent meta analysis of studies of ecological impacts of surface coal mining in the united states found substantial average reductions in taxonomic richness and biotic abundance in streams affected by coal mining giam et al 2018 and that these biodiversity impacts persist even after site remediation a meta analysis of coal mine impacts in new zealand showed decreased species richness and changed community composition in mine impacted streams clapcott et al 2016 biotic change was correlated with time post mining mining density and mining intensity bernhardt et al 2012 showed that critical thresholds for biological impairment are likely to arise where surface coal mines in the eastern united states occupy more than 5 4 of their contributing catchment area while many of the detrimental impacts of coal mining can be minimised or even avoided through following best practice there is still a need for strategic planning assessments to understand what these detrimental impacts may be there are several frameworks in the literature outlining overarching modelling approaches for assessing the impacts of coal mining e g lechner et al 2017 mcintyre et al 2018 such frameworks tend to feature the integration of multi disciplinary aspects of mining including social economic geochemical hydrological and ecological impacts whilst hydrological modelling is a key component of these frameworks it is typically not dealt with in any detail some hydrological modelling frameworks have been proposed for assessing impacts of land use change in general e g mcintyre et al 2014 but there does not appear to be a comprehensive modelling framework that looks in detail at the specific hydrological challenges presented by coal resource development ping et al 2017 used mike she to evaluate the impact of coal mining on river flows in a 1584 km2 catchment in china they calibrated the model to pre mine conditions using one response gauge and a monthly time step then compared simulations during a subsequent mining period with observed river flows the results suggest that each ton of raw coal reduces annual river flow by 2 87 m3 8 of which is due to reductions in surface runoff and 92 due to reductions in baseflow we note that the reliance of this methodology on observed flows means that it is not amenable to prediction of future developments a similar methodology using the yrwbm model was reported by guo et al 2017 and suggested an average annual flow reduction of about 60 in a large catchment with a surface coal mine coverage of about 29 1 2 aims this paper discusses options for modelling the impacts on local and regional streamflow characteristics of existing or potential future coal developments particularly coal mining and coal seam gas extraction in doing this the modelling framework developed here makes a number of assumptions about the modelling environment and its constraints implicit in this is the need to assess the differences in streamflow between two development scenarios one that incorporates the mining developments and one that does not assuming suitable future climate inputs are available this approach can readily be extended to assess the impacts of any potential future coal developments these impacts can be assessed against a baseline scenario without coal developments or one that includes existing coal operations several studies have demonstrated that the hydrological impact of coal mining is proportional to the upstream areal extent of mining e g petty et al 2010 bernhardt and palmer 2011 lindberg et al 2011 an implication of this is that the presence of multiple mines in a catchment is likely to have a more substantial impact on the catchment s water resources than a single mine in the united states coal mining approvals are often issued without consideration of the impacts of existing adjacent mines lindberg et al 2011 in australia mine proposals are usually required to address the issue of such cumulative impacts franks et al 2010 although this requirement is not always adhered to franks et al 2010 grech et al 2016 in some other regions of the world illegal coal mining is prevalent dutu 2016 cherdantsev and thurner 2017 and is unlikely to be subject to any environmental regulation or any recognition of cumulative impacts another objective of the modelling framework is therefore that it should be capable of predicting the cumulative impacts of multiple developments in doing so it should provide predictions of hydrological change at multiple locations where the impacts may potentially be felt both in the vicinity of the developments and further downstream this change may include several characteristics of the flow regime including but not limited to total volume high flow rate and frequency low flow rate and frequency and cease to flow frequency the quantification of change in a number of flow metrics allows the possibility of assessment of the impact of coal developments on water dependent systems these might include water availability for irrigation industry or water supply water quality and potential impacts on the sustainability and ongoing viability of water dependent ecosystems and the plant and animal species that depend on them taken together these dependencies along with predictions of water availability and their associated uncertainties can provide regulators with crucial objective information on the potential social economic environmental and ecological risks of future developments this information can be used to inform decisions on the licensing of proposed developments and on the types and ranges of conditions that might be attached to such licences while deterministic predictions of hydrological change are useful regulators will often be interested in knowing the range of potential impacts so it is ideal that the impacts be framed in some kind of uncertainty structure here we do this through considering the range of likely parameter values associated with all model inputs and report model results via the 10th 50th and 90th percentile of model outputs post et al 2020 community confidence in the results can be increased by making all data model inputs and outputs publicly accessible in a transparent way this also aids in the reproducibility and repeatability of the work this paper seeks to flesh out a surface water modelling framework that is suitable for meeting these objectives and assumptions in doing so it is complementary to the overarching frameworks of lechner et al 2017 and mcintyre et al 2018 it does not explicitly deal in detail with options for the modelling of groundwater mediated changes in surface flow important though these are but assumes that information on such changes is provided separately by a suitable and possibly coupled groundwater model as described in peeters et al 2018 or sreekanth et al 2020 nor does it canvass options for modelling changes in water quality 2 impacts of coal resource development on water resources the coal resource developments considered here include surface and underground coal mining and coal seam gas extraction while there are many similarities in how these different types of extractive industries manage water and how this affects streamflow generation there are also differences between types of industry and their impacts may be highly site specific the impacts of coal resource development on downstream flow conditions depend on the combination of factors that may enhance or deplete that flow these factors include extraction method water management regime waste disposal approach and hydrogeological setting some combinations of factors lead to increased storm runoff and increases in the frequency and magnitude of flooding e g ferrari et al 2009 miller and zégre 2014 while others lead to groundwater drawdown and declining streamflows jankowski and knights 2010 qiao et al 2011 the specific activities that may affect streamflow and water quality in receiving waters include coal seam dewatering hydraulic fracturing interception of surface runoff extraction of water from streams or groundwater disposal of mine water and co produced water longwall coal extraction and void collapse spoil disposal and diversion of upstream watercourses the ways in which these can impact streamflow are depicted in fig 1 the remainder of this section will provide a more detailed description of each of these activities and their potential impacts on streamflow note that for the purposes of this paper we are considering impacts that occur during the life of a mine post mining reclamation and rehabilitation is not considered explicitly 2 1 coal seam dewatering the dewatering of coal mines and depressurisation of coal seam gas fields leads to decreases in local groundwater levels and induces flow into the pumped coal seam thus necessitating continued pumping the spatial extent of the ensuing groundwater drawdown cone depends on the hydraulic conductivity and storativity of the layers the head changes caused by depressurisation of a target coal seam may be transmitted to other rock strata the magnitude and timing of any head change depends on the hydraulic properties of the affected strata zhao et al 2017 in general these changes are expected to be larger or faster in areas of faulting or fracturing zhao et al 2017 in particular dewatering and depressurisation may also affect alluvial aquifers possibly altering or reversing flow gradients between rivers and aquifers and potentially reducing the discharge of baseflow from the groundwater to a connected stream sun et al 2020 any enhanced inter aquifer connectivity see section 2 2 creates potential for water quality degradation both in the aquifers themselves and in any water discharged from them to adjacent waterbodies 2 2 hydraulic fracturing many coal seams feature sufficient natural fracturing to stimulate the production of gas without further fracturing however other seams may have lower permeability and require artificial fracturing to induce commercially viable rates of gas flow this fracturing is achieved through the high pressure injection of a fluid containing water various proppants such as sand and other chemical additives some of this fracturing fluid may be returned to the surface along with water produced during depressurisation hydraulic fracturing of coal seam gas wells may potentially alter inter aquifer connectivity and preferential flow paths mallants et al 2018 some of the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing may impair groundwater quality and may compromise the quality of any co produced water that is pumped out of the wells after fracturing elliott et al 2017 2 3 interception of surface runoff an open cut coal mine is likely to cause significant change to surface cover and vegetation this in turn is likely to lead to reductions in canopy interception of rainfall and in soil infiltration capacities infiltration might also be reduced by compaction associated with the use of heavy machinery thus there is likely to be an increase in surface runoff being generated on the disturbed area furthermore the amount of interception i e the size of the mine s physical footprint is likely to change considerably over time increasing as the mine develops and expands and decreasing during mine site remediation the impact this increased surface water has on downstream flow depends on the licensing conditions the mine is operating under in australia it is usual for coal mines to be required to retain on site any surface runoff that is generated on site nsw government 2015 this leads to reductions in streamflow downstream in comparison with the natural pre mine flows however in areas without such license restrictions e g the appalachian coalfields of the united states surface runoff is allowed to discharge into the streams either directly or via sediment ponds thus leading to an increase to the natural flows in downstream waters particularly in peak flows and storm event runoff bernhardt and palmer 2011 evans et al 2015 2 4 extraction of water from streams or groundwater water is a crucial component in coal mining and coal processing fresh water is sourced from streams groundwater or other water bodies overton 2020 and is used for a variety of purposes including to reduce the fire hazard in underground mines coal washing dust suppression and cooling cutting surfaces we note that there may be some regions or jurisdictions where direct extraction is only allowed through the purchase of licences from existing water users this situation is prevalent in australia where mines are often developed in areas of longstanding irrigated agricultural activity such as the hunter valley and namoi regions of nsw overton 2020 extraction through this mechanism might not substantially change the total extraction by all users from the stream but it might alter its timing and location 2 5 disposal of mine water and co produced water water sourced from groundwater pumping interception of surface runoff or extraction from streams may be temporarily stored on site there are a number of potential fates for this water some of it is likely to be used on site for coal washing dust suppression etc in some developments such as those in the upper hunter valley of nsw the water may be used for irrigation of on site or nearby crops mercuri et al 2005 navi et al 2015 list a range of uses of co produced water from coal seam gas developments in australia and the united states including irrigation livestock watering environmental flow augmentation domestic and industrial uses fire protection power generation groundwater recharge dust suppression aquaculture and snow making in some developments produced water may be left indefinitely in storage to evaporate although this is becoming much less common in australia particularly in queensland where the practice is essentially banned ehp 2012 the water or more commonly concentrated brine may be transported off site some developments may be licensed to discharge water directly to the stream network in the latter case this discharge may be strictly regulated and only allowed during favourable conditions northey et al 2016 such conditions might be when natural river flows are high and the discharge is not likely to significantly affect the quality of the river flows in some jurisdictions such as the hunter valley of nsw where a salinity trading scheme is in effect the discharge of stored water is regulated by a permit system in which mining companies buy discharge permits at auction and are allowed to trade permits with other producers franks et al 2010 2 6 longwall coal extraction and void collapse subsidence of material above a longwall coal mine has the potential to change the surface landscape to such an extent that the generation of surface runoff or its flow paths are altered these changes may in turn alter the hydrology of nearby wetlands subsidence has been reported to cause alterations in surface elevation of up to 2 m in the united states darmody 1998 and australia hinchliffe 2003 gullo 2006 and up to 3 4 m in china hu and gu 1995 subsidence is generally restricted to a distance of up to several hundred metres from the collapsed panel while the associated horizontal displacements may extend for several kilometres from the mine workings krogh 2007 subsidence may also result in increased surface ponding which will in turn mean that some runoff water could evaporate or recharge rather than reach the natural drainage network furthermore surface cracking as a consequence of subsidence may also lead to increased recharge and reduced runoff and has been implicated in the reduction and possible loss of flow in overlying streams and in the draining of wetlands krogh 2007 jankowski and knights 2010 lechner et al 2016 subsidence also has the potential to increase baseflow by altering the hydraulic conductivity of the layers above long wall panels herron et al 2018 some of the potential impacts of subsidence on hydrology can be ameliorated by channelling or recontouring the landscape lechner et al 2016 in some jurisdictions underground mining companies may be required to adopt such mitigation strategies 2 7 spoil disposal most coal mining produces substantial quantities of overburden and interburden the non economic material spoil that must be removed to access the coal seams this spoil is usually stored in designated spoil heaps on or adjacent to the mine site often this spoil will be used in post mining reclamation to recontour the mined landscape in jurisdictions such as australia where the spoil is kept on the mine site its impact on downstream flow is minimal except to the extent that it comprises part of the mine footprint area from which surface water is prevented from leaving except in specified circumstances however in other parts of the world the spoil heap may have significant impacts on downstream flow a common form of surface coal mining in parts of the united states is mountaintop mining with valley fills palmer et al 2010 this method involves the removal of coal seams running through a mountain or ridge with the associated overburden being pushed into adjacent valleys often burying existing stream reaches that may be several kilometres in length peng 2000 valley filling thus fundamentally alters the natural flow conditions and the riverine ecosystems that depend on them furthermore water emerging from the base of valley fills after percolating through the unconsolidated spoil is typically contaminated with dissolved solids and salts acids and metals associated with the weathering of the newly exposed strata or from the mining process itself hartman et al 2005 pond et al 2008 2 8 diversion of upstream watercourses the management of upstream water entering a mine site may vary depending on jurisdiction and licensing conditions in some places surface runoff from outside the footprint of the disturbed area is likely to be diverted around and past the mine site this is unlikely to cause significant change to the volume or timing of water reaching the downstream receiving waters elsewhere upstream flow might pass through the spoil areas of the mine site and temporarily be directed into sediment ponds merricks et al 2007 under these conditions the total volume of flow contributing to downstream rivers is likely to decrease and its timing and quality are likely to be affected 3 considerations affecting model structure and choice 3 1 data constraints approaches to modelling the impacts of coal resource development on streamflow can be constrained by data availability this is particularly true where model calibration is required the temporal and spatial scales of streamflow modelling are dictated largely by the temporal and spatial scales of the available meteorological input data traditionally meteorological data is derived from point measurements with appropriate spatial interpolation and extrapolation where required however there has been a trend in recent years towards the development of gridded climate data that is suitable for use in hydrological modelling ledesma and futter 2017 an example is the australian silo daily rainfall and climate data vaze et al 2011 jeffrey et al 2001 which are available as 0 05 0 05 degree approximately 5 km rasters it follows that in modelling conducted with this data set the smallest temporal element will be one day and the smallest spatial element will be 0 05 degrees however this raw spatial scale does not preclude modelling at finer spatial scales through interpolation and nor does it preclude the assessment of the impacts of coal resource developments with sub pixel extents similarly model choices might be constrained by the spatial and temporal resolutions of any response data that is used for model calibration in many situations there may be no suitable local response data available for model calibration and the modeller may have to make use of data and calibrated parameters from nearby representative catchments 3 2 considerations in streamflow modelling streamflow models take input from meteorological data primarily rainfall and potential evaporation and produce inflows to the stream network almost all streamflow models contain parameters with unknown values which must be estimated by calibration this calibration is usually done by comparing predicted streamflows with those observed at streamflow gauging stations the major challenge in streamflow modelling is to produce credible predictions of streamflow in ungauged parts of the modelling domain sivapalan 2003 this usually involves the estimation of appropriate model parameters to use in those parts of the landscape this process of parameter estimation in the absence of direct calibration is called regionalisation there are two broad categories of regionalisation one involves using parameter values from a gauged catchment that is considered to share similar characteristics climate soils vegetation etc to the ungauged area often it is found that the simple expedient of using parameters from the nearest gauged catchment is among the best regionalisation methods e g oudin et al 2008 implicit in this nearest neighbour approach is the assumption that catchments in close proximity are likely to share similar physical and hydrological characteristics and that therefore optimal models of each of them will also share similar parameter values however there is a significant degradation in model performance with this type of regionalisation as regionalisation distance increases viney et al 2014 the prediction performance of proximal regionalisation can also be dominated by locally anomalous calibration catchments the second regionalisation approach involves multi objective calibration of a model using observations from several nearby gauging stations in this approach the calibration procedure uses a single objective function that combines the prediction responses in all gauged catchments and results in a single set of model parameter values that provide best fit to the streamflow observations from all gauges the key assumption here is that if a single set of parameter values provides good predictions in the gauged catchments it might also be expected to provide good predictions in adjacent ungauged areas this regionalisation approach is called regional calibration peel and blöschl 2011 unlike nearest neighbour calibration the performance of regionally calibrated models does not degrade with distance from the calibration catchments and the effects of poor quality streamflow records are diminished viney et al 2014 regional calibration requires that all significant sources of spatial variability are accounted for in the model at a minimum this requires spatial distribution of climate inputs but ideally also includes spatial variability in land cover and perhaps soil properties and topography regional calibration requires a model with two key characteristics the first requirement is that the model be capable of making spatially explicit predictions of streamflow a simple bucket model is not suitable without substantial spatialisation the second necessity is a model structure that represents the impacts of these sources of spatial variability in a way that is independent of the set of optimisable parameters such a structure might be one based on hydrological response units e g leavesley and stannard 1995 or one based on explicit input of land cover or vegetation density information e g sivapalan et al 2002 the desire for a model capable of predicting the cumulative impacts of multiple developments also points to the need for a model that can make predictions at multiple locations it is crucial that these predictions involve a consistent and coherent distributed response this points strongly towards regional calibration and the use of a semi distributed model with global i e unvarying over the model domain optimisable parameters prediction of change in hydrological systems is usually achieved either through using changed inputs e g a changed climate series or through using altered parameter values to reflect changed catchment conditions seibert and van meerveld 2016 the latter approach is required for predicting change impacts of coal resource development however where long time period realisations are being considered it may be prudent to also accommodate potential changes in climate input chiew et al 2018 3 3 linkages with groundwater modelling several of the flow pathways depicted in fig 1 cannot be adequately quantified using a typical surface water model they instead require the application of a dedicated groundwater model in particular these pathways include the effects of groundwater extraction which is common to coal seam gas extraction and to both surface and underground mining and of the controlled collapse of underground voids there are several modelling packages that integrate groundwater and surface water such as gsflow mike she and cathy bizhanimanzar et al 2020 some of these have the potential to circumvent or simplify coupling issues however here we consider the more general case of distinct surface water and groundwater models which may in any case have advantages in terms of pragmatism and applicability at appropriate scales this manuscript assumes that appropriate quantification of these groundwater mediated fluxes and associated uncertainty is available from a groundwater model or a cascading suite of groundwater models and does not further discuss the technical details of how those fluxes might be obtained for a discussion of a suitable groundwater modelling framework for coal resources the reader is referred to crosbie et al 2016 there is however a need for those fluxes to be coupled directly or indirectly with the surface water model the groundwater models possibly including both a regional model and an alluvial model and the surface water models possibly including both a landscape model and a river system model need to pass information between each other considerable care is required in designing how this is achieved this is particularly true when considering the need to run models for different levels of coal resource development and the need to accommodate the various post processing steps there are three principal coupling points between surface water and groundwater models the first is that river stage heights generated by the surface water model are used to provide boundary conditions to the groundwater model secondly a groundwater model may require estimates of the temporal distribution of recharge to groundwater these estimates can be obtained from a suitable surface water model but may require scaling to a longer timestep for use in a groundwater model crosbie et al 2015 thirdly the exchange fluxes between groundwater and the river are calculated in the groundwater model and passed back to the surface water model as changes in baseflow generation while most surface water models include a baseflow groundwater flow term it is unlikely that this will be capable of adequately quantifying the changes in groundwater flux associated with mining induced changes in groundwater levels and gradients in general these points of commonality between surface water and groundwater models argue strongly in favour of the two components being developed concurrently for a particular application 3 4 accounting for water regulation and management water regulation and management is not usually accounted for in a conventional surface water model where it has a significant impact on streamflow it will be advantageous to propagate the flows generated by the surface water model through a suitably constructed river routing model a river routing model typically uses a node link concept where a river system is schematized into a simplified river network using a node link structure the river network begins and ends with a node and all nodes are interconnected by links a link is used for transfer of flow between two nodes with routing runoff from gauged or ungauged tributaries or the local contributing area between two nodes is fed into the connecting link as an inflow at the relevant location all other physical processes such as diversions groundwater fluxes overbank flow occurring between the two nodes are incorporated in the link dutta et al 2013 components of the river water balance computed by a river routing model might include a routing scheme demand modelling e g for irrigation or other consumptive uses storage management e g dam volumes and releases floodplain dynamics interactions between surface water and groundwater a river routing model typically requires calibration and this needs to be done against daily streamflow observations at a number of gauging stations within the basin it is preferable but not crucial that this calibration period coincide with that used for calibration of the rainfall runoff model of the components depicted in fig 1 a river routing model could be employed to introduce and propagate flows associated with managed extractions and discharges to the stream on site storage and flowpath redirection 4 putting it all together 4 1 how to define a future the focus of this manuscript is on assessing the potential future hydrological impacts of proposed coal resource developments these developments may occur against a background of past and currently active coal mines and coal seam gas fields in other words there may be pre existing developments that have already changed the local hydrological regime from its original state we are interested therefore in quantifying how much further change beyond that which has already occurred that the proposed developments might induce in general terms we identify three futures or scenarios one which we call the undeveloped scenario is a simulation of the hydrological regime that would prevail in the absence of any coal resource development a second scenario which we call the baseline future encompasses the impact which may be ongoing of existing developments the third scenario the expansion future accounts for both pre existing and proposed developments it is important to recognise that agents of hydrological change other than those related to coal resource development may be active in the location of interest such factors might include land use changes such as urbanisation deforestation or changes in climate notwithstanding the fact that surface mining also represents a significant land use change it is not unreasonable to assume that other non mining land use changes are common to all three scenarios acknowledging that there may be other developments associated with mining e g urban development that are not considered here similarly it is reasonable to assume that the climate drivers while possibly changing over time will also be common to all three scenarios the ultimate objective is to provide insight into the differences in hydrology between the baseline and expansion futures the undeveloped scenario is included here to allow as described in subsequent subsections the possibility of using observed streamflow data from unaffected catchments in calibrating the models and in subsampling simulation replicates for uncertainty analysis 4 2 how and where to place model nodes the surface water nodes provide the key output locations for surface water modelling as such it is critical that node locations align with nodes in the river system models however it is also important to note that streamflow will often change only slowly with distance down a river this is particularly true in reaches with little lateral tributary inflow this means that predicted streamflow at a single output location can often provide appropriate predictions for a range of locations along a river reach in particular this single set of streamflow predictions may be well within the uncertainty limits of the surface water modelling in such environments a single model node may prove adequate even in quite long river reaches elsewhere in places where the density of model nodes is insufficient for impact modelling it may be feasible to interpolate streamflows to any new output location the surface water model nodes are the locations where streamflow predictions are made in general these nodes are located either at streamflow gauges above major confluences immediately below proposed coal mine and coal seam gas developments at locations required for impact modelling e g at ecologically sensitive or significant locations an example of node placement is shown in fig 2 note however that in principle model nodes can be placed anywhere in the stream network and are not limited to the examples described above 4 3 calibration why and what most surface water models include unknown parameter values and require calibration against observed streamflow data calibration seeks to ensure that the models are providing the best achievable predictions of the relevant flow metrics it should be noted that in the context of the prediction of the impacts of future coal resource developments a modelling application that relies on the difference between two scenarios places less rigorous demand on calibration than a conventional modelling setting this is because to some extent biases in model prediction will cancel out under differencing furthermore the need for identifying an optimal parameter set is further reduced in an uncertainty based modelling framework which samples from the feasible parameter space see section 4 6 although there is still a need to identify an appropriate prior and likelihood function associated with the feasible parameter space regional calibration of a spatially distributed model requires observed streamflow data from a number of gauging sites these sites do not necessarily have to be located within the modelling domain but should be representative of the climatic and hydrological regimes present in the modelling domain here we propose the use of a set of calibration catchments that are not impacted by coal resource development this allows the generation of predictions in the modelling domain of an undeveloped future criteria for selecting the catchments for calibrating a runoff model might include that they have catchment areas that are broadly commensurate with or greater than the subcatchments of the modelling domain have recent long term measurements preferably more than 20 years and preferably including wet and dry periods are currently not impacted by coal mining or coal seam gas extraction or other major extractive industries have no significant flow regulation e g dams are not nested i e not directly upstream or downstream of another selected gauge are located within or close to the region of interest and have similar hydrological and climatic regimes a suitable objective function for a regional calibration is one that combines the goodness of fit measures from all or most of the calibration catchments the goodness of fit measures are often based around the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 or the prediction bias viney et al 2009 it is noted that efficiency based optimisation typically leads to parameter sets that are biased towards high flow prediction even though high flow events are typically underestimated mizukami et al 2019 it is notoriously difficult for any optimisation scheme to simultaneously enable strong predictions of both high flow and low flow characteristics typically an emphasis on optimising predictions at one end of the flow range will compromise predictions at the other end however the impacts of coal resource development on surface hydrology are likely to have impacts on both high flow and low flow characteristics for this reason we propose the use of two separate calibration runs one biased towards high flows and one biased towards low flows the latter can be achieved by using an efficiency based objective function with a box cox transformation box and cox 1964 or by adopting specifically developed low flow metrics the two parameter sets need not necessarily be used directly in predicting the hydrological changes associated with coal resource development but they can be used as a guide in selecting samples for an uncertainty analysis as described in section 4 6 4 4 incorporating the impacts of coal mining and coal seam gas extraction 4 4 1 changes in baseflow as outlined in section 3 3 a stand alone surface water model is unlikely to be capable of accurately estimating changes in baseflow discharge associated with groundwater extraction and depressurisation in the absence of a fully integrated surface water groundwater modelling framework changes in baseflow in fig 1 are introduced into the surface water model as output from a groundwater model as described in section 4 5 4 4 2 changes in surface runoff generation potential changes in surface runoff generation can occur through several mechanisms and appropriate methods for dealing with them depend in part on what controls the proponent puts in place to minimise them development of a mine site is almost certain to change the nature of the land surface for example the disturbed area might be converted from deep rooted forest to bare soil or short rooted vegetation such a conversion is likely to cause changes in the way the landscape processes incident precipitation including changes in canopy interception infiltration and evapotranspiration in general terms then a surface water model is required that has the capability to modify the relevant surface fluxes either through altered parameter values or through modification to the prevailing hydrological response unit in practice accurate specification of these modifications may be difficult but can be guided by observation a special case of surface runoff change occurs where coal mines are prevented by legislation from allowing any surface water to discharge from the mine site in these circumstances changes in surface runoff can be modelled simply as reductions in runoff that are proportional to the area of disturbance increased ponding associated with land subsidence due to longwall mining has the potential to decrease runoff from overlying surfaces that may be otherwise unaffected by vegetation removal and other surface modification the change in runoff from a catchment containing an underground operation is likely to be proportional to the area subject to longwall collapse however it is not clear what value that proportionality constant should take and there does not appear to be any guidance in the literature see for example the review commissioned by the iesc commonwealth of australia 2015 in part this is because mine proponents have the capacity to ameliorate or at least partly ameliorate the impacts of ponding by preventing land subsidence and or introducing contouring of the land surface proportionality constants are sometimes estimated by proponents and published in mine planning documents for australian longwall mines a proportionality constant taking account of amelioration practices of about 5 of the area above longwall panels is often adopted in mine planning documents pers comm this proportion gives the amount by which surface runoff above collapsed longwall panels may be reduced below natural levels 4 4 3 extraction of water from streams or groundwater where there is a proposal for a mine or gas field to extract water directly from the stream network it will seldom be possible to model the decision making processes that lead to variations in the timing and volume of extractions instead a simpler approach requires the development and application of a suitable time series of extracted volumes such a time series will often be derivable from mine planning documents any such extractions can be subtracted from modelled flow in affected streams extraction of water from groundwater resources for mine use is equally difficult to model and for similar reasons again the modeller will need to develop a suitable input time series of the volume of groundwater extractions possibly derived from mine planning documents if extraction rates are unknown this is often modelled as a specified head boundary condition it should be noted that where extractive water use for a mine or gas field is in competition for a regulated finite resource with other licensed users e g irrigators industrial users then any increase in water take for the coal industry might be offset by concomitant reductions in water take by other users although the mine proponent may instead choose to provide compensation bores to existing users accessing different aquifers 4 4 4 disposal of produced water the impact of produced water on downstream flow is largely dependent on the nature and methods of disposal some disposal methods such as transporting the water off site have no local impact while other uses such as dust suppression and coal washing are likely to have negligible impacts on the volume of streamflow although impacts on water quality may be significant tasker et al 2018 the disposal methods that are likely to have the greatest impact on downstream flow are those associated with direct discharge to the stream network in a mining environment with unregulated discharges it is extremely difficult to assess the volumes and timings associated with such discharges and mine planning documents are unlikely to provide much guidance to the modeller in particular any conscious decisions related to auction and trade systems will not generally be readily amenable to inclusion in a hydrological modelling framework at best it may be possible to infer from modelled streamflow characteristics the timing and duration of any opportunistic discharges that arise in response to periods of high natural flow although these discharges may be partly subject to the whims of human decision making the volume of any such discharges is likely to be dependent on the amount and quality of water available for discharge and on the height and duration of the discharge window a discharge model built from observations of behaviour during previous discharge opportunities would appear to provide the most tractable way forward of course any unregulated discharges to the stream network that is those that take place due to accidents in defiance of or in the absence of any regulatory control are far more difficult to incorporate into any modelling framework the modeller must nonetheless be alert to the possibility that such discharges may be occurring and be open to considering ways of dealing with them within the model 4 4 5 other alterations to flow paths diversions of flow pathways caused by valley fill spoil disposal or bunding around tenements are unlikely to have significant impact on the volumes of flow in receiving waters at the scales of interest here 10 km2 or more unless they are associated with a major meso scale disruption to the drainage network they may however have significant impacts on the timing of streamflow as well as on water quality hartman et al 2005 if however flow is being diverted into an adjoining valley or catchment system it can readily be incorporated into the routing scheme of a semi distributed modelling system 4 5 model sequencing in the absence of a single coupled and integrated surface water routing and groundwater model considerable care is required in linking the three models in particular the stages of the process at which mining mediated changes are introduced needs to be carefully considered for a three scenario modelling strategy undeveloped baseline and expansion futures an example model sequence is shown in fig 3 this sequencing structure is appropriate for a mining regime in which all runoff generated on the mine site is retained in circumstances where runoff is allowed to leave the site and enter the natural stream network a different sequencing strategy may be appropriate the basic structure of fig 3 is of runoff and recharge output from the runoff model being passed to the routing model and stage height output from the latter being passed to the groundwater model there may be further iteration between the routing and groundwater models as baseflow adjustments from the latter are passed back to the former in this example since all runoff is retained on site mining related changes in surface runoff can be assumed to be directly proportional to the area of the mine footprint relative to that of the entire subcatchment no further modelling of surface runoff change is required the volumes and timings of extractions of water from the stream are largely driven by human decision making and are therefore very difficult to incorporate in a physical model nonetheless mine proponents are likely to have nominated typical stream water take rates in their mine planning documents and these rates can be prescribed in the model similarly the volumes and timings of discharges of water into the stream are partly driven by human decision making however they are also likely to be limited to specific prescribed high flow events whose occurrence and duration can be estimated from the output of the routing model the endpoint of the example in fig 3 is an estimation of the differences in streamflow metrics between the expansion and baseline futures the modelling scheme is thus focussed on the change in surface water statistics as a result of the expansion developments rather than on predicting the actual future surface water flow under a given development pathway 4 6 uncertainty there is a growing awareness of the difficulties and limitations of producing accurate deterministic forecasts of hydrological variables concomitantly there is an increasing demand from managers and stakeholders for probability based estimates of the likelihood of occurrence of certain events however despite this increasing awareness and recognition that quantification of uncertainty in model projections should be explicitly included in studies of hydrological change harmel et al 2014 most studies still rely on comparisons using a single best parameter set seibert and van meerveld 2016 uncertainty in hydrological modelling arises from three main sources data uncertainty which includes uncertainty in input data and in calibration data structural model uncertainty and parameter uncertainty the first two of these can be difficult to identify and quantify renard et al 2010 here we focus on parameter uncertainty which derives from spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the model domain and may be influenced by temporal variability in meteorological conditions or by spatial variability in surface and subsurface properties parameter uncertainty is thus reflective of uncertainties in both input and calibration data and also in process descriptions and model approximations as such parameter uncertainty may be considered as a partial integrator of all three uncertainty sources we advocate for an uncertainty approach that focuses on finding a comprehensive range of parameter combinations that provide predictions that are plausibly consistent with the relevant observations relevant observations are those that are able to constrain the parameters to which the predictions are sensitive and are preferably of the same type as the prediction metrics that are considered to be important for quantifying the potential social economic environmental and ecological risks of future developments the resulting distribution of the prediction is then considered to be the estimate of uncertainty of the hydrological response variable such an approach might proceed as follows 1 perform a sensitivity analysis e g peeters et al 2018 to identify the parameters that are most sensitive for some or most of the relevant hydrological response variables 2 establish prior distributions of each sensitive parameter that are biased towards the calibration results 3 sample from the prior distributions and compare the resulting simulations against a suite of relevant observational metrics 4 choose a subset of the parameter sets perhaps the best 10 as determined by comparison with observations to represent the uncertainty in the predictions the first step of this approach merely eliminates from further consideration any parameter that is found to have little influence on the predictions in other words any uncertainty in the value of such a parameter does not lead to significant uncertainty in the predictions the second step makes use of the calibrated parameter values to construct prior distributions that are more likely to give rise to reasonable predictions than an unbiased i e uniform distribution would the calibrated parameter values represent an optimal parameter set traditional modelling approaches would simply use these optimal parameter values run the model and report the results without any consideration of uncertainties in these parameter values while we eschew this approach there is arguably useful information in the optimal parameter values and thus we use this information to bias the range of potential parameter values towards this optimal parameter set the range of potential parameter values in the distribution can be set to be quite wide it is not essential that the parameter range is the best estimate of the uncertainty of the parameter it is sufficient for the range to be plausible and realistic in the case where two or more sets of calibrated parameters are available and represent different aspects of the hydrograph as proposed in section 4 3 the prior distribution should be biased towards giving higher weighting to parameter values near to some measure of central tendency in the calibrated parameter values the variance of the calibrated parameter values should be reflected in the shape parameter of the prior distribution an example of this approach is illustrated in fig 4 where a beta distribution is used to establish prior parameter distributions from two sets of calibration parameters notionally these might be a set of parameters that reflects high flow response and another set of parameters that reflects low flow response the mean of each distribution is taken as the mean of the parameter values in the two calibrations and the variance spread of the distribution reflects the similarity or divergence of the two values where the two calibrations yield similar parameter values e g fig 4a and b the beta distribution is narrower than for calibrations with dissimilar parameter values fig 4c and d the parameter values on the horizontal axes in fig 4 are normalised to the range 0 1 where a parameter is suspected to behave in a logarithmic manner that is where there is significant sensitivity in model output as the parameter value approaches zero the beta distribution can be log transformed before it is normalised the parameter bounds represented by the parameter fractiles should be relatively wide whilst infeasible parameter values should be avoided there is no reason why values that lie outside the modeller s expectation cannot be included in the range of the prior distribution the third step of the uncertainty approach is to run a large number of model simulations using parameter values sampled from their respective beta distributions the output from these simulations can be compared to observations preferably using a combination of the types of observations e g high flow metrics low flow metrics that are appropriate for the application these model simulations with randomly sampled parameters inevitably result in a significant number of poor predictions this is to be expected when sampling from wide parameter bounds furthermore parameter correlation issues can lead to simulations that use infeasible combinations of parameter values and these too can compromise prediction accuracy in step four therefore it is suggested that a subset of the stochastic parameter sets those whose predictions best match the observations are selected the parameter values associated with this selection then provide the bases of the posterior parameter distributions the proportion of stochastic simulations to include in the posterior subset depends in part on the width of the prior parameter ranges and on the degree of parameter cross correlation but a proportion of around 10 is likely to provide a good balance between eliminating infeasible predictions and providing a satisfactory cohort for assessing prediction uncertainty however comprehensive the uncertainty quantification there will always be aspects of the chain of models that cannot be accounted for due to data availability constraints on time and budget or technical limitations the uncertainty quantification should therefore be complemented by a qualitative uncertainty analysis kloprogge et al 2011 peeters 2017 such a qualitative uncertainty analysis systematically discusses the assumptions and model choices made scores the extent to which the assumptions were affected by data availability budget and time constraints or technical limitations and most importantly assesses the extent to which the assumption may affect the predictions assumptions considered in this qualitative analysis include such things as the criteria for selecting calibration catchments choice of objective function and choice of likely coal resource development this qualitative uncertainty analysis aids in the communication to stakeholders about sources of uncertainty not accounted for in the uncertainty quantification and the degree to which they have the potential to affect the predictions 5 outputs and outcomes from streamflow modelling 5 1 output metrics it is important to establish well defined hydrological response variables explicitly defined in space and time that can be used to summarise the results of the numerical modelling and support reasoned explanations for the potential changes in the hydrologic regime these variables should be representative of the flow characteristics that are important for assessing impacts on economic and environmental assets ideally they might include a mix of metrics that describe low flow characteristics and high flow characteristics a large cohort of potential flow metrics has been proposed for assessing ecologically sensitive change in river flows kennard et al 2010 to quantify the changes in flow characteristics associated with resource extraction some of the important low flow metrics might include such variables as the number of zero flow days per year the first percentile of daily streamflow rates the number of days per year for which streamflow fails to exceed a low threshold the length of the longest continuous period each year in which streamflow fails to exceed a low threshold high flow metrics might include annual streamflow the 99th percentile of daily streamflow rates the number of days per year for which streamflow exceeds a high threshold streamflow modelling should enable these and other potential variables to be calculated quasi independently for each modelling node ideally the threshold based metrics could be tuned to the flow stages that are significant for hydrological or ecological function such thresholds might include those at which pool disconnection occurs low flows or at which overbench or overbank flow occurs high flows each of the output metrics can be calculated as an annual time series for both the baseline and expansion scenarios the difference between the two series for a given metric yields a direct measure of the impact of the expansion on the relevant streamflow characteristic it is relatively straightforward to find the year with the largest impact either in absolute or proportional terms and the magnitude of that change 5 2 interpretation of uncertainty in output metrics model runs derived from monte carlo sampling from the posterior parameter set yield a distribution of maximum impacts and a distribution of the time year of maximum impact for each node and for each flow metric the fifth and 95th percentiles of these output distributions can be interpreted as a measure of uncertainty in the predicted hydrological change an uncertainty scheme like this also allows the identification of a zone of potential hydrological change that is the spatial extent of significant impact associated with the developments in the expansion scenario a particular node or reach can be considered to be potentially impacted if there is a likelihood of significant change in any of the hydrological response variables in this context likelihood may be defined as a small probability say 5 of the maximum change exceeding a relatively conservative subjective threshold peeters et al 2018 for changes in streamflow characteristics a suitable threshold might be a small percentage change for volumetric flow variables or a small change in occurrence of frequency based variables this zone of potential hydrological change thus delineates an area within and likely downstream of the modelling domain that could be targeted for additional monitoring or for change mitigation strategies conversely given small exceedance probabilities and conservative thresholds it is reasonable to conclude that any part of the domain that is outside the zone of potential hydrological change that is there is a high probability that there is no significant impact to any of the hydrological response variables is likely to be unaffected by the resource development and may be safely ruled out from further detailed examination peeters et al 2018 suggest that the union of this surface water zone of potential hydrological change with a similar zone calculated for groundwater impacts e g using spatially explicit groundwater drawdown simulations can provide suitable spatial bounds for a whole of system zone of potential hydrological change 5 3 implications for ecological assessment changes in surface water hydrology associated with coal resource development form an integral part of the chain of interactions between the resource extraction activities and any potential impacts on water dependent ecosystems ecosystems may be affected directly by exposure to changes in the depth to water tables in the volume and permanence of streamflows or in the frequency and magnitude of inundation events bunn and arthington 2002 kennard et al 2010 it is important to recognise that any such impacts may be spread over time and may persist long after the mining activities that cause them have ceased it is also important to recognise that some impacts may be irreversible any water dependent species or ecosystem within the zone of potential hydrological change described in section 5 2 could be considered to be potentially affected positively or negatively by the resource development this does not mean that an impact is inevitable but rather based on the magnitude of the hydrological change the possibility of a significant impact exists and further investigation may be warranted while the current scientific understanding of the quantitative links between hydrological change and ecological response is poor vaughan et al 2009 wheeler et al 2018 some predictive models are emerging e g stratford et al 2016 rolls et al 2017 it is expected that such models will make increasing use of uncertainty in hydrological flows to inform uncertainty in ecological responses 6 conclusions this manuscript outlines a methodological framework for modelling the impacts of proposed coal mining and coal seam gas extraction on downstream river flows the methodology combines the direct impacts of changes in surface runoff generation the indirect impacts of changes in groundwater surface water interactions and the impacts of mine water management whilst discussed here in terms of coal resource development this methodology has the potential to be readily adapted and applied to a range of extractive industries including but not limited to minerals and other sources of unconventional gas we advocate for a semi distributed modelling scheme that allows for predictions of streamflow change at multiple locations within a modelling domain and which accounts for the cumulative effects of multiple coal mine and coal seam gas extraction developments the framework assesses the differences in streamflow between two development scenarios one that incorporates the mining developments and one that doesn t assessing the differences in hydrological response between different development scenarios but otherwise using common climate inputs can minimise the effects of data and calibration uncertainties the proposed methodology is framed in terms of a structured uncertainty analysis to provide information on the likelihoods and potential ranges of various impacts the assessments thus derived can provide regulators with crucial objective information on the potential social economic environmental and ecological risks of future developments the modelling framework described here does not explicitly include water quality it is acknowledged that water quality can play a major role in influencing the water mediated impacts of coal resource development especially those associated with ecological change water quality characteristics are critically dependent on the water fluxes either through the various water fluxes carrying with them soluble concentrations that are commensurate with the concentration of the respective water source or through particulate material carried by sediment transport processes this framework thus provides a suitable base for extension to the modelling of water quality issues example applications of the modelling framework described in this manuscript appear in a companion paper by viney et al 2021 declaration of competing interest the
