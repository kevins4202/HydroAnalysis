analysis is conducted to evaluate the performance of four ml methods random forest rf extreme gradient boosting xgboost deep neural network dnn and long short term memory lstm the lstm based model is selected as the optimal predictive model of tp concentration in euiam lake e tp on seasons may to october with high rainfall and inflow from two upstream dams chuncheon dam and soyanggang dam we also perform a gradient based analysis to figure out the most influential factors on e tp using the lstm model the top four priority factors are tp concentrations and suspended solids concentrations in the upstream dams this application of the gradient based analysis enables the predictive model to discuss quantitative reductions in the priorities based on these numerical results we anticipate that the proposed framework can enhance the feasibility of management practices for achieving the water quality management goal of the study region new hydrological insights this study demonstrates that a robust predictive model can be developed for a serial impoundment system with distinct seasonal characteristics of rainfall temperature and water quality thereby facilitating the selection of management priorities based on the predictive model results we conclude that it is the key for managing the target tp concentration to prioritize the incoming tp concentrations and determine the

flourishing of phytoplankton wu et al 2016 among various nutrients that typically flow into water bodies phosphorus is considered a limiting factor for algal bloom in eutrophic lakes bechmann et al 2005 phosphorus is a key nutrient to support growth and biological activities therefore it plays an important role in aquatic terrestrial and agricultural ecosystems cheng et al 2018 since phosphorus sources have been increasing and diversifying caused by changes in human lifestyle and population growth wu et al 2016 it is necessary to characterize and predict the water quality especially total phosphorus tp concentration to manage algal blooms in eutrophic lakes euiam lake supplying drinking water to the central area around seoul in the republic of korea has suffered from severe algal blooms due to eutrophication choi et al 2015 this eutrophication has been causing water quality deterioration oxygen deficiency and other undesirable consequences zhang et al 2013 as euiam lake is a serial impoundment system made by three dams i e euiam dam chuncheon dam and soyanggang dam with different discharge patterns the water quality of euiam lake e g tp concentration depends on the quality and quantity of water discharged from the two upstream dams the discharge from neighboring reservoirs also impacts the downstream water quality through several factors such as the environmental conditions of the targeted area water quality determinants and the operation and management of adjacent reservoirs chung et al 2008 ji et al 2021 yu et al 2021 han and an 2008 concluded that downstream water quality and its constituents are closely related to flushing from upstream reservoirs thus influencing changes in downstream water quality additionally environmental characteristics such as weather conditions and watershed characteristics tend to trigger excessive phosphorus concentrations of euiam lake over the last few decades the population increase of nearby cities further highlights the importance of managing the water quality of euiam lake the anthropogenic phosphorus originating from sewage treatment plants deteriorates water clarity ecosystem diversity and water quality edwards and withers 2007 for the aquatic ecosystem data regarding environmental parameters tend to exhibit seasonal trends implying the significance of time series analyses lee et al 2020 2019 the accuracy of time series analyses depends on the selection of driving factors affecting the water quality for selecting these driving factors previous studies have conventionally resorted to statistical analyses such as regression abyaneh 2014 chenini and khemiri 2009 naseema et al 2013 studied several physicochemical parameters e g phosphate concentration and concluded that the characteristics of surface water exhibited seasonal trends in addition pollutants from diverse sources including atmospheric deposition runoff and discharge from other reservoirs are also governed by seasonal phenomena ouyang et al 2006 therefore the characterization and prediction of phosphorus concentrations should be based on time series analysis however the assumption of a normal distribution and linear relationships and the troublesome feature of multicollinearity in regression analyses often mislead inferences regarding the effects of environmental factors on water quality najah et al 2013 varanka and luoto 2012 over the last decade machine learning ml has been proposed as a promising strategy for overcoming the drawbacks of traditional statistical analyses investigating the causality of complex environmental phenomena and predicting water quality chen et al 2021 kim et al 2020 najah ahmed et al 2019 tiyasha et al 2020 several studies using ml have been conducted for predicting tp concentration hanson et al 2020 shen et al 2020 and for case studies e g algal bloom and inflow in south korea rivers hong et al 2020 ly et al 2021 hanson et al 2020 applied the recurrent neural network rnn and process guided rnn to increase phosphorus prediction accuracy and reveal phosphorus cycling using limited data in eutrophic lake mendota wisconsin usa shen et al 2020 generated geographic data by applying a random forest rf that regressed seasonally measured nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in us rivers using 47 environmental variables ly et al 2021 collected data with 20 variables at 40 stations of the han river watershed in the republic of korea and developed ml models for algal bloom prediction hong et al 2020 performed an ml based prediction of the amount of inflow into the soyanggang dam in the republic of korea however few studies have been conducted to predict influential factors for managing eutrophication and algal growth among various ml applications some studies have focused on conducting learning based sequence forecasting analyses using long short term memory network lstm dikshit et al 2021 developed an lstm based model to evaluate drought indices using drought data from 1901 to 2018 mohammed et al 2021 used a lstm model to predict the microbial quality of water in pipes huang et al 2021 suggested a reservoir management strategy with an accurate prediction of the suspended solids ss concentration by applying different ml algorithms in their works support vector machines and lstm models showed satisfactory performance in predicting the ss concentration recently explainable ml methods have been implemented to characterize the relationship between input and output variables of complex ml models and search for significant input variables influencing output variables amodei et al 2019 samek et al 2017 the integrated gradient method proposed by sundararajan et al 2017 has been known as an efficient technique for visualizing variables that have significant impacts on model prediction performance in big data analysis e g image recognition and natural language processing amodei et al 2019 samek et al 2017 this study gives our intention to that gradient values calculated within the integrated gradient process can be utilized in studies to determine influential factors through relative comparisons between these values sundararajan et al 2017 for brevity this method is called a gradient based analysis throughout this study in this respect this study aims to predict tp concentration and determine the most important water quality parameter using ml methods with consideration for 1 serial impoundment system in euiam lake in the republic of korea 2 seasonal trends of environmental parameters and 3 complex interactions between nutrients and environmental factors the increase of tp predictability enhances the possibility of establishing a field management plan and a quantitative reduction goal for sequential data analyses lstm is employed to model the prediction of tp concentration for reflecting the characteristics of the serial impoundment system in euiam lake and seasonal trends of environmental parameters input data used in the developed lstm model are as follows intensive water quality hydrodynamics and meteorological data acquired from serial impoundments made by three dams i e euiam dam chuncheon dam and soyanggang dam a tributary a sewage treatment plant and a meteorological station between march 2007 and november 2020 in the republic of korea for validation purposes the performance of the lstm model is compared and analyzed with those obtained using popular ml models that were rf extreme gradient boosting xgboost and deep neural network dnn finally gradient based analysis of the developed model is performed to prioritize management strategies and the results were analyzed and discussed this paper is composed of five sections section 1 introduced the background and purpose of this study section 2 explains in detail how the datasets were acquired and pre processed in the study region section 3 details ml theories e g rf xgboost dnn and lstm section 4 presents the results of applying ml based models to solve water management problems and a comparison of the model performances the model with the highest tp concentration prediction performance in validation and test steps was also selected in this section for enhancing the feasibility of prioritizing tp management the most influential factors on the tp concentration were determined using gradient based analysis we also discuss quantitative reductions in the priorities identified to achieve water quality goals section 5 summarizes the conclusions of the study 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region euiam lake located in the republic of korea is an artificial lake formed upstream of euiam dam for hydroelectric power generation fig 1 the average water level of euiam lake is 71 5 m above sea level its storage capacity is 8 0 107 m3 thus enabling hydroelectricity generation for euiam lake there are two major water inflows from chuncheon dam and soyanggang dam chuncheon dam whose storage capacity is 1 5 108 m3 is also operated for hydroelectricity generation and discharges water for an entire year however soyanggang dam with a storage capacity of 2 9 109 m3 only discharges water to maintain the water level during a rainy season in the summer for this reason the water flushed from chuncheon dam has a different discharge pattern compared to that from soyanggang dam furthermore euiam lake is characterized by its complex landscape with several small islands limiting the mixing of the water body because of recreational areas and sewage treatment plants nearby it seems that the water quality in euiam lake is also affected by point and non point pollution sources moreover as reported in previous studies spears et al 2008 weather conditions particularly temperature and solar radiation are expected to influence tp concentrations due to these complex hydraulic characteristics and the influence of pollutants euiam lake is eutrophic and suffered from severe algal blooms choi et al 2015 therefore phosphorus concentration of euiam lake must be managed to prevent eutrophication and algal blooms for implementing successful water quality strategies the expected influential factors should be determined by assessing the differences in the water discharge patterns between chuncheon dam and soyanggang dam the complex landscape of euiam lake watershed variations in pollution sources and critical atmospheric phenomena such as air temperature and solar radiation our study attempts to evaluate the impact of these determinants using ml analysis for accounting for several potential input variables that affect phosphorus concentrations in euiam lake 2 2 data acquisition preprocessing and preparation for ml 2 2 1 data acquisition the entire dataset consisted of 40 input variables and one output variable with 546 raw data records acquired from the serial impoundment made by three dams a tributary a sewage treatment plant and a meteorological station between march 2007 and november 2020 note that the dataset excluded data collected during winter because freezing conditions limited the acquisition of hydrologic and water quality data hydrologic data and daily dam operation data were acquired from the water resources management information system http www wamis go kr from the republic of korea water quality data from the dams a tributary and a sewage treatment plant were collected by the national water quality monitoring program of the ministry of environment me http water nier go kr of the republic of korea to predict tp concentrations in euiam lake as an output variable e tp throughout this study we selected 40 input variables that affected phosphorus concentration by regulating physical chemical and biological reactions similar to e tp an acronym was assigned to each variable as shown in table 1 2 2 2 data preprocessing the raw data were pretreated to construct efficient ml models to predict the e tp figs 2 5 illustrate plots of the input variables recorded at the three dams the tributary the sewage treatment plant and meteorological data their data intervals range from six to eight days because tributary data were measured monthly it was assumed that the measured data values of the tributary were constant every four weeks log transformations were applied to e flow c flow s flow and met rainfall data the savitzky golay filter was employed as a smoothing filter to capture trends in daily data savitzky and golay 1964 schafer 2011 the window size and polynomial degree of the filter were nine and three respectively the savitzky golay filter was not applied to tributary and meteorological data because tributary variables were converted from monthly to weekly data extreme meteorological data values indicated important weather events e g the maximum rainfall during the rainy season and were thus preserved 2 2 3 preparation of training validation and test datasets for ml implementation after data preprocessing the entire dataset was split into three datasets for ml implementation as follows 72 as training data from march 2007 to november 2016 14 as validation data from march 2017 to november 2018 14 as test data from march 2019 to november 2020 table a1 lists the statistical parameters of the input and output variables used in this study all variables were normalized using their minimum and maximum values and then used to construct the ml models it is worth noting that the full dataset exhibited the characteristics of sequential data because the water discharged from the two upstream dams i e chuncheon and soyanggang dams was mixed when the discharged water flowed into euiam dam through the tributary and sewage treatment plant as discussed in section 2 1 furthermore the full dataset showed seasonal characteristics for spring summer and autumn figs 2 through 5 because of these characteristics an ml algorithm specialized in sequential data analysis was expected to yield satisfactory prediction results 3 machine learning ml algorithms this section briefly describes the four ml algorithms used to build a ml based predictive model of e tp the first two are decision tree based algorithms rf and extreme gradient boosting xgboost the other two are neural network based algorithms dnn and lstm each ml algorithm will be discussed in more detail in section 3 3 1 random forest rf rf proposed by breiman 2001 is an ml algorithm composed of multiple decision trees fig 6 shows how to train the rf algorithm let x and y be the input and output vectors respectively the first training step is called bootstrapping in which the dataset is split into random samples s n x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x n y n with replacement where n is the number of samples the next step is to train each decision tree using random samples let y ˆ i be the estimate of the ith decision tree as follows y ˆ i h ˆ x s n i where h ˆ x s n i is a tree based prediction function and s n i i 1 2 n q represents multiple random samples as shown in eq 1 the arithmetic mean of y ˆ i becomes the estimate of rf and y ˆ this averaging step is called bagging altman and krzywinski 2017 breiman 2001 1 y ˆ 1 n q i 1 n q h ˆ x s n i where n q is the number of decision trees in the rf 3 2 extreme gradient boosting xgboost gradient boosting is a prediction algorithm in the form of an ensemble composed of shallow decision trees where each tree sequentially learns and minimizes the model error natekin and knoll 2013 extreme gradient boosting xgboost is an ml algorithm that is a hybrid of multiple decision trees and the gradient boosting concept compared to rf xgboost has the advantage of improving prediction performance by controlling overfitting via regularization moreover xgboost has been known as faster than conventional gradient boosting in terms of processing speeds because of its compatibility with parallel computing chen and guestrin 2016 in fig 7 xgboost is trained by sequentially adding decision trees one by one let y ˆ i be the output result for instance at an arbitrary step i at the last step i n t i e the number of decision trees the output y ˆ n t can be expressed as follows y ˆ 0 0 y ˆ 1 f 1 x y ˆ o f 1 x y ˆ 2 f 1 x f 2 x y ˆ 1 f 2 x 2 y ˆ n t k 1 n t f k x y ˆ n t 1 f n t x where f k k 1 2 n t is the kth decision tree let us denote j the objective function of xgboost to be minimized j is the sum of the training loss and regularization terms as follows 3 j i 1 n p l y i y ˆ n t i k 1 n t ω f k where l is the loss function e g mean squared error mse y i is the actual output n p is the number of predictions and ω is the regularization function chen and guestrin 2016 as decision trees are added sequentially xgboost is frequently used for time series analyses ghosh et al 2021 lu et al 2020 yu et al 2020 3 3 deep neural network dnn the dnn algorithm consists of an input layer l i one or more hidden layers and an output layer l o lecun et al 2015 mathematically the dnn algorithm is expressed as follows 4 y i σ j 1 n n w ij x j β i where y i is the output at the ith neuron of the current hidden layer l h x j is the input from the jth neuron of the previous hidden layer l h 1 w ij is the weight between the ith neuron of l h and the jth neuron of l h 1 β i is the bias at the ith neuron of l h σ is the activation function and n n is the number of neurons in the l h 1 lecun et al 2015 the training process of dnn first randomly assigns the initial values of weights and biases in all layers second the forward propagation process is performed from l i to l o and the loss function e g mse is calculated third the weights and biases are sequentially updated through the back propagation process from l o to l i finally steps 2 3 are repeated until the improvement in the loss function value becomes insignificant lecun et al 2015 in this study the xavier initialization glorotnormal as the weight and bias initialization technique and the adaptive moment estimation adam optimizer were used to minimize the loss function value by initializing and updating the weights and biases respectively glorot and bengio 2010a kingma and ba 2014 3 4 long short term memory lstm lstm has been proposed to solve the limitation of long term memory caused by the vanishing gradient problem which means that the gradient value becomes too small and the learning performance of the model no longer improves cheng et al 2016 hochreiter 1998 hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 lecun et al 2015 in the lstm structure lstm cells are connected repeatedly similar to a chain fig 8 shows the schematic of an lstm cell the previous hidden state h t 1 carries past information into the lstm cell and the previous cell state c t 1 also provides longer information regarding past events the lstm cell consists of a cell state c t forget gate f t input gate i t and output gate o t let w f w i w o and w c be the weight matrices from the f t i t o t and c t to the input x t respectively u f u i u o and u c represent the weight matrices from the f t i t o t and c t to the hidden state h t respectively and b f b i b o and b c are defined as the bias of f t i t o t and c t respectively in f t the information of h t 1 and x t is combined and passed to the sigmoid activation function sigmoid between 0 and 1 if the output of f t is close to 0 it means to forget f t close to one means to keep mathematically f t can be expressed as follows 5 f t sigmoid w f x t u f h t 1 b f the next step is to decide what new information to store in c t for new information i t determines the updated value by passing the sigmoid and new candidate values c t are created through the hyperbolic tangent activation function tanh i t and c t can be expressed as follows 6 i t sigmoid w i x t u i h t 1 b i 7 c t tanh w c x t u c h t 1 b c as f t i t and c t are added into c t the c t 1 is updated as follows 9 c t f t c t 1 i t c t where means the pointwise multiplication of two vectors finally o t decides what information to pass to c t and h t is created by combining o t through which the sigmoid is passed and c t through the tanh as follows 10 o t sigmoid w o x t u o h t 1 b o 11 h t o t tanh c t if the output of i t and o t is close to zero it means that it is not essential information conversely an output close to one indicates critical information at each time point c t and h t are transferred to the next lstm cell by minimizing the results of the loss function and this training process is repeated until no more significant improvement in the loss function value is attained 3 5 development of the framework to prioritize total phosphorous management strategies using machine learning algorithms throughout this study all ml simulations were performed in python 3 7 environments rf and xgboost were conducted using the randomforestregressor from the scikit learn library pedregosa et al 2011 and xgbregressor from the xgboost library brownlee 2019 respectively dnn and lstm were performed on tensorflow 2 3 0 and keras 2 4 0 the architecture of each ml model rf xgboost dnn and lstm was designed as follows 1 the rf model with the number of decision trees the maximum depth of the decision tree and the maximum number of features to select 2 the xgboost model with the number of trees in the rf to fit the maximum tree depth for base learners boosting learning rarity and subsample ratio of columns when constructing each tree 3 the dnn model with two hidden layers and one dropout layer and 4 the lstm model composed of two lstm layers with dropout layer and recurrent dropout layer for designing the dnn model various activation functions were candidates for example linear sigmoid lecun et al 1991 2012 hyperbolic tangent tanh lecun et al 1991 2012 rectified linear unit relu lecun et al 2015 ramachandran et al 2017 softplus nair and hinton 2010 ramachandran et al 2017 exponential linear unit elu clevert et al 2016 ramachandran et al 2017 and scaled exponential linear unit selu klambauer et al 2017 ramachandran et al 2017 dropout and early stopping algorithms were used to prevent overfitting the dropout algorithm proposed by srivastava et al 2014 is a method that prevents overfitting by randomly dropping some neurons this study also employed an early stopping algorithm that forcibly terminated the training process when the test set error started to increase prechelt 1998a 1998b xavier initialization glorotnormal as a weight initialization technique and the adaptive moment estimation adam optimizer were used to minimize the results of the loss function by initializing and updating the weights and biases glorot and bengio 2010b kingma and ba 2014 4 results and discussion 4 1 hyperparameter tuning and performance evaluation of ml models we developed ml based models for predicting the tp concentration in euiam lake e tp hyperparameter tuning was conducted to optimize the performance of the ml models the set of optimal hyperparameter values for each ml model was determined using a grid search bergstra and bengio 2012 kim and shin 2020 a variety of cases were generated by combining hyperparameter values extracted from a uniform distribution and then evaluated bergstra and bengio 2012 kim and shin 2020 table 2 summarizes the hyperparameters with their ranges and intervals after the grid search the set of hyperparameter values with the minimum mean absolute error mae among 500 cases was selected as fit for each ml model the resultant hyperparameter values for the four ml models are listed in table 3 table 4 summarizes the prediction performance indicator values for the optimized ml models the prediction performance of ml models was evaluated through the following indicators pearson correlation coefficient r concordance correlation coefficient ccc coefficient of determination r2 mean squared error mse mae root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percentage error mape for all models their training performances were satisfactory as their r2 values were greater than 0 9 for the validation and test sets the lstm model outperformed the other ml models in terms of r 0 8853 and 0 9246 ccc 0 8875 and 0 9137 r2 0 7838 and 0 8549 mse 0 0017 and 0 0060 mae 0 0303 and 0 0511 rmse 0 0412 and 0 0775 and mape 30 79 and 24 57 fig 9 compares the actual and predicted e tp values obtained using ml models all the ml models accurately estimated the historical e tp data and captured their overall trends among the ml models this visual comparison indicates that the lstm model captured the rapid change in the e tp history because of high suspended solids and rainfall with the highest accuracy 4 2 comparison of seasonal performance obtained using ml models based on their prediction performances all ml models were deemed suitable for forecasting e tp using the chuncheon dam soyanggang dam tributary sewage treatment plant and meteorological data as input variables interestingly after dividing the prediction performance of all ml into three seasons spring summer and autumn e tp prediction performance of spring was found to be relatively low as mentioned in 2 2 1 winter data were excluded from this analysis due to freezing conditions to figure out the seasonal performance differences and their causes the seasonal model performance was compared as shown in fig 10 in terms of the prediction performance of the e tp the lstm model outperformed the other three ml models nevertheless the lstm model showed the lowest seasonal prediction performance in the spring fig 11 shows the taylor diagram of the ml models predicting e tp in each taylor diagram the standard deviation and correlation r2 values are marked as numbers for comparing the monthly prediction performance of the ml models overall the lstm model yielded the highest correlation among the four ml models interestingly the correlations were lower in march and april when we compared the monthly performance the performance indicator values of the lstm models were also less satisfactory although this model showed better correlations than the other three ml models when comparing fig 11 a with fig 11 b and c the standard deviation of spring is relatively smaller than those of summer and autumn this small standard deviation would be because spring is dry season in the korean peninsula in general this low rainfall resulted in low water flow affecting the model accuracy on the other hand most models showed satisfactory prediction performance in summer the rainy season although the lstm model showed the highest prediction performance in september the prediction performance decreased after october and showed a relatively low prediction performance in november as entering winter another dry season to investigate the effect of rainfall on the low prediction performance of the lstm model in dry season march april and november e tp and rainfall characteristics are compared in fig 12 the average monthly rainfall in the study region was estimated as 25 6 mm in march and 64 2 mm in april these estimates are relatively low compared to the average monthly rainfall range of 83 6 413 4 mm from may to september in addition the amount of water discharged from two upstream dams was relatively low because of the need to increase the water storage capacity of euiam dam before the farming season march to april considering that the paddy and field farming season spans from may to october the tp discharge from watersheds and neighboring reservoirs remained low because agricultural activities using artificial fertilizers were typically not carried out during spring march to april the spring season does not show dynamic changes in the tp concentration affected by environmental factors no fertilizer usage and low water discharge therefore comparatively low levels of rainfall and tp concentration during spring season resulted in low prediction performance in the four ml models figs 10 and 11 based on the seasonal characteristics of prediction performance we claim that tp management efforts in euiam lake should focus on the season with high rainfall and flow from the upstream dam may to october and mid range hydrologic conditions ranging from 0 to 60 of the total flow 4 3 gradient based analysis of lstm model to prioritize management strategies the lstm which exhibited the highest prediction performance among the four ml models was used to derive the priority management factor among the influential factors to manage tp concentrations in other words the gradient based analysis was conducted to quantify the contribution of each input variable to the final output e tp to target and prioritize the factors that most affected e tp in the gradient based analysis the contributions were calculated as gradients obtained from the differential operation of the input sequence to the prediction the gradienttape api supported by tensorflow 2 0 was used to compute and capture the gradients bisong 2019 campesato 2020 the implementation of the gradient based analysis consisted of three steps 1 use the gradienttape api to capture gradients on 40 inputs in the lstm model 2 generate gradients with the same shape as the input sequence as the training set consisted of 390 data points in the time series for 40 inputs in this case study 390 gradients were sequentially generated for each input 3 obtain the contribution of each input as the average of gradients over the time dimension the higher the average gradient was the more influential the input contribution to the output i e e tp was fig 13 illustrates the results of the gradient based analysis of the lstm model for 40 input variables to prioritize management strategies based on the gradient based analysis the primary and secondary priority factors corresponding to the top 10 were the tp concentrations of the two upstream dams c tp and s tp respectively these two tp concentrations were followed by the ss concentrations of the upstream dams c ss and s ss this result is consistent with the behavior of nutrients such as fertilizers phosphorus and nitrogen adsorbed onto soil particles as soil particles flow into the system during intense rainfall events in summer xiao et al 2013 the tp concentration of the sewage treatment plant tb tp was also analyzed as a high management priority however tb tp concentrations ranged from 0 03 to 0 20 mg l for approximately 95 of the year and was less affected by seasonal fluctuations therefore tb tp was considered relatively low importance compared to the tp concentration in the upstream dam the other two factors water temperature of soyanggang dam s wt and met rainfall i e 7 d sum rainfall show high gradient after the upstream tp and ss concentrations because these two factors were related to meteorological phenomena and difficult to control through dam operation management and upstream pollutant inflow they were excluded from the discussion of management priorities in addition the ss concentration of the upstream dam is known to be difficult to manage in the field because fluctuations in the concentration hugely depend on the presence or absence of rainfall the intensity of rainfall and the duration of rainfall therefore it is most effective for managing e tp to superintend the tp concentration c tp and s tp of two upstream dams based on the gradient based analysis result of the lstm model our results have significance in that the contribution of each factor is quantified for an efficient and systematic water quality management of the study region 4 4 field practical implications in water management and future perspectives the discharge from neighboring reservoirs might affect the downstream water quality in different ways depending on the environmental conditions of the targeted region water quality determinants and operation scenarios of neighboring reservoirs of serial impoundment chung et al 2008 previous research has suggested that the water quality of downstream water bodies depends on the relative concentration of nutrients between the water reserved in the dam and downstream of the dam malatre and gosse 1995 han and an 2008 also concluded that the water quality of downstream water systems are closely linked to flushing from upstream reservoirs therefore to achieve the optimal water quality in a study region with a complex topography and distinct seasonal water temperature and rainfall characteristics it is essential to carefully designate management priorities through contribution analysis and determine quantitative reduction levels in terms of water quality management policy euiam lake is under the total maximum daily loads tmdls regulation to maintain its tp concentration e tp under 0 02 mg l as a target criterion for brevity let us call e tp 0 02 mg l the tmdls criterion because of the tmdls regulation it is necessary to make a water quality management plan by determining the management priority and quantitative reduction to achieve the tmdls criterion in this case study the priorities influencing e tp were analyzed using the lstm model which previously accounted for seasonal characteristics more accurately than the other ml models based on the lstm model s gradient based analysis the priority factors corresponding to the top 10 for e tp were the tp c tp and s tp and ss c ss and s ss concentrations of the two upstream dams quantitative analyses were conducted to determine the reduced levels of the priority factors c tp s tp c ss and s ss required to achieve the tmdls criterion to account for uncertainty in the quantitative analysis raychaudhuri 2008 we performed a monte carlo simulation to determine the quantitative management levels of c tp s tp c ss and s ss the monte carlo simulation procedure is as follows 1 the lstm model was used as the predictive model i e the proxy model of the monte carlo simulation 2 random samples were generated for the monte carlo simulation to generate random samples based on field data 1000 random samples following a normal distribution were generated using the mean and standard deviation of input variables for each year from 2007 to 2020 14 years this collection of sample data yielded 14 000 1000 14 years data points fig b1 shows the density plots of the smoothed data 546 data points and random data for the input variables because the shapes of the density plots of the smoothed and random data are similar random data adequately reflects the actual phenomenon 3 e tp of 14 000 were predicted using the lstm model and random data and the distribution of c tp s tp c ss and s ss was investigated based on the management goal i e tmdls criterion from the distribution of four priority factors q1 q2 and q3 are selected to calculate the reduction concentration and percentages to achieve the management goal tmdls criterion e tp 0 02 mg l where q1 q2 and q3 refer to the lower quartile median and upper quartile in each distribution q2 and interquartile range q3 q1 can be considered as representative value and descriptive spread of the distribution of four priority factors respectively fig 14 illustrates violin plots to visualize the distribution of the priority factors based on the tmdls criterion table 5 summarizes their statistical parameters it was estimated that c tp and s tp concentrations should be reduced from 0 0041 mg l to 0 0139 mg l 34 5 48 3 and 0 0039 mg l to 0 0218 mg l 41 1 66 9 respectively in other words it means that the reduction of s tp is required more than that of c tp to achieve the target criteria this is consistent with the results of the slope based analysis of the lstm model that c tp affects e tp more sensitively than s tp it was also estimated that c ss and s ss concentrations should be reduced from 0 2252 mg l to 4 2213 mg l 13 8 60 8 and 0 3866 mg l to 6 8434 mg l 36 8 80 0 respectively this result means that the reduction degree of the ss concentration to achieve the target criterion of e tp is required to be greater than that of the tp concentration as mentioned above the ss concentration in the study area varies greatly depending on the presence intensity and duration of rainfall therefore it is judged that there is uncertainty in the field management of ss concentration for effective water quality management through the application of ml models we developed the robust predictive model for the study site which showed complex topographical characteristics caused by serial impoundments as well as distinct seasonal characteristics in water quality based on the gradient based analysis of the lstm model we generated data for each priority element c tp c ss s tp s ss through monte carlo simulation in order to build their data distributions subsequently we determined the quantitative reduction level for achieving the tmdls criterion of euiam lake as a consequence it is expected that the management priority and reduction level to achieve e tp suggested in this regional case study can be utilized as an efficient tool in the on site water quality management policy the ml model can be readily constructed and operated by environmental engineers and decision makers as a useful tool for water quality prediction in surface water system with already measured water quality data additional analysis such as the gradient based analysis can provide interpretations for the reasons that most affected water quality of the surface water system the ml model techniques also have an advantage to better understand a non linear relationship between variable water quality parameters nonetheless to establish a water quality management policy based on machine learning some limitations still remain 1 the developed ml model should be regularly updated with the data immediately available from the measurements since the ml model technique is dependent on the data availability and 2 it is necessary to count on the environmental variability such as the intensity of rainfall and the duration of rainfall caused by climatic change it would be future works to investigate towards involving climatic variables to predict water quality changes and determine management priorities using developed ml model further studies are also needed to expand the variables that can take into account environmental variability and accumulate continuous monitoring data which can increase applicability and model performance 5 conclusions this study determined the factors that must be prioritized to control the tp concentration of euiam lake using ml based analyses including rf xgboost dnn and lstm the dataset consisted of 40 input variables and one output variable acquired from the three dams i e euiam dam chuncheon dam and soyanggang dam of serial impoundment a tributary a sewage treatment plant and a meteorological station between march 2007 and november 2020 among the four ml methods assessed herein the lstm model was the optimal approach because it rendered the most accurate predictions of e tp the prediction performance of the lstm model was characterized by outstanding r values 0 8853 0 9246 ccc values 0 8875 0 9137 r2 values 0 7838 0 8549 mse 0 0017 0 0060 mae 0 0303 0 0511 rmse 0 0412 0 0806 and mape 24 57 65 72 all ml models showed acceptable performance in forecasting e tp the accuracy of this model for predicting e tp in the spring season was below our expectations nevertheless the lstm model outperformed the other three ml models in predicting e tp of the spring season despite exhibiting the lowest prediction performance in march april and november the low prediction performance of the ml models during spring was attributed to the comparatively low levels of rainfall and tp concentration during this season based on this result this season was excluded from the analysis of dynamic tp concentration changes affected by environmental factors in this case study based on these predicted seasonal characteristics management strategies to control tp concentrations in euiam lake should focus on months with high rainfall and flow from the upstream dam in terms of water quality management policy euiam lake is regulated by the tmdls while maintaining e tp under 0 02 mg l as the target tmdls criterion therefore to achieve this tmdls criterion this study presented a water quality management plan with respect to input variables obtained from serial impoundment by determining the management priority and quantitative reduction the priorities influencing e tp were analyzed using the lstm model which has previously been demonstrated to describe seasonal characteristics more accurately than other ml models based on the lstm model gradient based analysis the priority factors corresponding to the top 10 for e tp were the tp c tp and s tp and ss c ss and s ss concentrations of the two upstream dams the distribution of c tp s tp c ss and s ss according to the tmdls criterion was analyzed using the monte carlo simulation as a result to achieve the tmdls criterion the c tp and s tp concentrations was approximately predicted to be decreased from 0 0041 mg l to 0 0139 mg l 34 5 48 3 and from 0 0039 mg l to 0 0218 mg l respectively it was also estimated that c ss and s ss concentrations should be reduced from 0 2252 mg l to 4 2213 mg l 13 8 60 8 and 0 3866 mg l to 6 8434 mg l 36 8 80 0 respectively our findings indicate that a robust predictive model can be developed for a study site with distinct seasonal rainfall and temperature characteristics and large seasonal changes in water quality thus facilitating the selection of management priorities therefore it is expected the proposed approach to be used as a cost efficient tool for water quality management in the field by quantitatively deriving the reduction level of the selected priority credit authorship contribution statement

selected as the optimal predictive model of tp concentration in euiam lake e tp on seasons may to october with high rainfall and inflow from two upstream dams chuncheon dam and soyanggang dam we also perform a gradient based analysis to figure out the most influential factors on e tp using the lstm model the top four priority factors are tp concentrations and suspended solids concentrations in the upstream dams this application of the gradient based analysis enables the predictive model to discuss quantitative reductions in the priorities based on these numerical results we anticipate that the proposed framework can enhance the feasibility of management practices for achieving the water quality management goal of the study region new hydrological insights this study demonstrates that a robust predictive model can be developed for a serial impoundment system with distinct seasonal characteristics of rainfall temperature and water quality thereby facilitating the selection of

flourishing of phytoplankton wu et al 2016 among various nutrients that typically flow into water bodies phosphorus is considered a limiting factor for algal bloom in eutrophic lakes bechmann et al 2005 phosphorus is a key nutrient to support growth and biological activities therefore it plays an important role in aquatic terrestrial and agricultural ecosystems cheng et al 2018 since phosphorus sources have been increasing and diversifying caused by changes in human lifestyle and population growth wu et al 2016 it is necessary to characterize and predict the water quality especially total phosphorus tp concentration to manage algal blooms in eutrophic lakes euiam lake supplying drinking water to the central area around seoul in the republic of korea has suffered from severe algal blooms due to eutrophication choi et al 2015 this eutrophication has been causing water quality deterioration oxygen deficiency and other undesirable consequences zhang et al 2013 as euiam lake is a serial impoundment system made by three dams i e euiam dam chuncheon dam and soyanggang dam with different discharge patterns the water quality of euiam lake e g tp concentration depends on the quality and quantity of water discharged from the two upstream dams the discharge from neighboring reservoirs also impacts the downstream water quality through several factors such as the environmental conditions of the targeted area water quality determinants and the operation and management of adjacent reservoirs chung et al 2008 ji et al 2021 yu et al 2021 han and an 2008 concluded that downstream water quality and its constituents are closely related to flushing from upstream reservoirs thus influencing changes in downstream water quality additionally environmental characteristics such as weather conditions and watershed characteristics tend to trigger excessive phosphorus concentrations of euiam lake over the last few decades the population increase of nearby cities further highlights the importance of managing the water quality of euiam lake the anthropogenic phosphorus originating from sewage treatment plants deteriorates water clarity ecosystem diversity and water quality edwards and withers 2007 for the aquatic ecosystem data regarding environmental parameters tend to exhibit seasonal trends implying the significance of time series analyses lee et al 2020 2019 the accuracy of time series analyses depends on the selection of driving factors affecting the water quality for selecting these driving factors previous studies have conventionally resorted to statistical analyses such as regression abyaneh 2014 chenini and khemiri 2009 naseema et al 2013 studied several physicochemical parameters e g phosphate concentration and concluded that the characteristics of surface water exhibited seasonal trends in addition pollutants from diverse sources including atmospheric deposition runoff and discharge from other reservoirs are also governed by seasonal phenomena ouyang et al 2006 therefore the characterization and prediction of phosphorus concentrations should be based on time series analysis however the assumption of a normal distribution and linear relationships and the troublesome feature of multicollinearity in regression analyses often mislead inferences regarding the effects of environmental factors on water quality najah et al 2013 varanka and luoto 2012 over the last decade machine learning ml has been proposed as a promising strategy for overcoming the drawbacks of traditional statistical analyses investigating the causality of complex environmental phenomena and predicting water quality chen et al 2021 kim et al 2020 najah ahmed et al 2019 tiyasha et al 2020 several studies using ml have been conducted for predicting tp concentration hanson et al 2020 shen et al 2020 and for case studies e g algal bloom and inflow in south korea rivers hong et al 2020 ly et al 2021 hanson et al 2020 applied the recurrent neural network rnn and process guided rnn to increase phosphorus prediction accuracy and reveal phosphorus cycling using limited data in eutrophic lake mendota wisconsin usa shen et al 2020 generated geographic data by applying a random forest rf that regressed seasonally measured nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in us rivers using 47 environmental variables ly et al 2021 collected data with 20 variables at 40 stations of the han river watershed in the republic of korea and developed ml models for algal bloom prediction hong et al 2020 performed an ml based prediction of the amount of inflow into the soyanggang dam in the republic of korea however few studies have been conducted to predict influential factors for managing eutrophication and algal growth among various ml applications some studies have focused on conducting learning based sequence forecasting analyses using long short term memory network lstm dikshit et al 2021 developed an lstm based model to evaluate drought indices using drought data from 1901 to 2018 mohammed et al 2021 used a lstm model to predict the microbial quality of water in pipes huang et al 2021 suggested a reservoir management strategy with an accurate prediction of the suspended solids ss concentration by applying different ml algorithms in their works support vector machines and lstm models showed satisfactory performance in predicting the ss concentration recently explainable ml methods have been implemented to characterize the relationship between input and output variables of complex ml models and search for significant input variables influencing output variables amodei et al 2019 samek et al 2017 the integrated gradient method proposed by sundararajan et al 2017 has been known as an efficient technique for visualizing variables that have significant impacts on model prediction performance in big data analysis e g image recognition and natural language processing amodei et al 2019 samek et al 2017 this study gives our intention to that gradient values calculated within the integrated gradient process can be utilized in studies to determine influential factors through relative comparisons between these values sundararajan et al 2017 for brevity this method is called a gradient based analysis throughout this study in this respect this study aims to predict tp concentration and determine the most important water quality parameter using ml methods with consideration for 1 serial impoundment system in euiam lake in the republic of korea 2 seasonal trends of environmental parameters and 3 complex interactions between nutrients and environmental factors the increase of tp predictability enhances the possibility of establishing a field management plan and a quantitative reduction goal for sequential data analyses lstm is employed to model the prediction of tp concentration for reflecting the characteristics of the serial impoundment system in euiam lake and seasonal trends of environmental parameters input data used in the developed lstm model are as follows intensive water quality hydrodynamics and meteorological data acquired from serial impoundments made by three dams i e euiam dam chuncheon dam and soyanggang dam a tributary a sewage treatment plant and a meteorological station between march 2007 and november 2020 in the republic of korea for validation purposes the performance of the lstm model is compared and analyzed with those obtained using popular ml models that were rf extreme gradient boosting xgboost and deep neural network dnn finally gradient based analysis of the developed model is performed to prioritize management strategies and the results were analyzed and discussed this paper is composed of five sections section 1 introduced the background and purpose of this study section 2 explains in detail how the datasets were acquired and pre processed in the study region section 3 details ml theories e g rf xgboost dnn and lstm section 4 presents the results of applying ml based models to solve water management problems and a comparison of the model performances the model with the highest tp concentration prediction performance in validation and test steps was also selected in this section for enhancing the feasibility of prioritizing tp management the most influential factors on the tp concentration were determined using gradient based analysis we also discuss quantitative reductions in the priorities identified to achieve water quality goals section 5 summarizes the conclusions of the study 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region euiam lake located in the republic of korea is an artificial lake formed upstream of euiam dam for hydroelectric power generation fig 1 the average water level of euiam lake is 71 5 m above sea level its storage capacity is 8 0 107 m3 thus enabling hydroelectricity generation for euiam lake there are two major water inflows from chuncheon dam and soyanggang dam chuncheon dam whose storage capacity is 1 5 108 m3 is also operated for hydroelectricity generation and discharges water for an entire year however soyanggang dam with a storage capacity of 2 9 109 m3 only discharges water to maintain the water level during a rainy season in the summer for this reason the water flushed from chuncheon dam has a different discharge pattern compared to that from soyanggang dam furthermore euiam lake is characterized by its complex landscape with several small islands limiting the mixing of the water body because of recreational areas and sewage treatment plants nearby it seems that the water quality in euiam lake is also affected by point and non point pollution sources moreover as reported in previous studies spears et al 2008 weather conditions particularly temperature and solar radiation are expected to influence tp concentrations due to these complex hydraulic characteristics and the influence of pollutants euiam lake is eutrophic and suffered from severe algal blooms choi et al 2015 therefore phosphorus concentration of euiam lake must be managed to prevent eutrophication and algal blooms for implementing successful water quality strategies the expected influential factors should be determined by assessing the differences in the water discharge patterns between chuncheon dam and soyanggang dam the complex landscape of euiam lake watershed variations in pollution sources and critical atmospheric phenomena such as air temperature and solar radiation our study attempts to evaluate the impact of these determinants using ml analysis for accounting for several potential input variables that affect phosphorus concentrations in euiam lake 2 2 data acquisition preprocessing and preparation for ml 2 2 1 data acquisition the entire dataset consisted of 40 input variables and one output variable with 546 raw data records acquired from the serial impoundment made by three dams a tributary a sewage treatment plant and a meteorological station between march 2007 and november 2020 note that the dataset excluded data collected during winter because freezing conditions limited the acquisition of hydrologic and water quality data hydrologic data and daily dam operation data were acquired from the water resources management information system http www wamis go kr from the republic of korea water quality data from the dams a tributary and a sewage treatment plant were collected by the national water quality monitoring program of the ministry of environment me http water nier go kr of the republic of korea to predict tp concentrations in euiam lake as an output variable e tp throughout this study we selected 40 input variables that affected phosphorus concentration by regulating physical chemical and biological reactions similar to e tp an acronym was assigned to each variable as shown in table 1 2 2 2 data preprocessing the raw data were pretreated to construct efficient ml models to predict the e tp figs 2 5 illustrate plots of the input variables recorded at the three dams the tributary the sewage treatment plant and meteorological data their data intervals range from six to eight days because tributary data were measured monthly it was assumed that the measured data values of the tributary were constant every four weeks log transformations were applied to e flow c flow s flow and met rainfall data the savitzky golay filter was employed as a smoothing filter to capture trends in daily data savitzky and golay 1964 schafer 2011 the window size and polynomial degree of the filter were nine and three respectively the savitzky golay filter was not applied to tributary and meteorological data because tributary variables were converted from monthly to weekly data extreme meteorological data values indicated important weather events e g the maximum rainfall during the rainy season and were thus preserved 2 2 3 preparation of training validation and test datasets for ml implementation after data preprocessing the entire dataset was split into three datasets for ml implementation as follows 72 as training data from march 2007 to november 2016 14 as validation data from march 2017 to november 2018 14 as test data from march 2019 to november 2020 table a1 lists the statistical parameters of the input and output variables used in this study all variables were normalized using their minimum and maximum values and then used to construct the ml models it is worth noting that the full dataset exhibited the characteristics of sequential data because the water discharged from the two upstream dams i e chuncheon and soyanggang dams was mixed when the discharged water flowed into euiam dam through the tributary and sewage treatment plant as discussed in section 2 1 furthermore the full dataset showed seasonal characteristics for spring summer and autumn figs 2 through 5 because of these characteristics an ml algorithm specialized in sequential data analysis was expected to yield satisfactory prediction results 3 machine learning ml algorithms this section briefly describes the four ml algorithms used to build a ml based predictive model of e tp the first two are decision tree based algorithms rf and extreme gradient boosting xgboost the other two are neural network based algorithms dnn and lstm each ml algorithm will be discussed in more detail in section 3 3 1 random forest rf rf proposed by breiman 2001 is an ml algorithm composed of multiple decision trees fig 6 shows how to train the rf algorithm let x and y be the input and output vectors respectively the first training step is called bootstrapping in which the dataset is split into random samples s n x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x n y n with replacement where n is the number of samples the next step is to train each decision tree using random samples let y ˆ i be the estimate of the ith decision tree as follows y ˆ i h ˆ x s n i where h ˆ x s n i is a tree based prediction function and s n i i 1 2 n q represents multiple random samples as shown in eq 1 the arithmetic mean of y ˆ i becomes the estimate of rf and y ˆ this averaging step is called bagging altman and krzywinski 2017 breiman 2001 1 y ˆ 1 n q i 1 n q h ˆ x s n i where n q is the number of decision trees in the rf 3 2 extreme gradient boosting xgboost gradient boosting is a prediction algorithm in the form of an ensemble composed of shallow decision trees where each tree sequentially learns and minimizes the model error natekin and knoll 2013 extreme gradient boosting xgboost is an ml algorithm that is a hybrid of multiple decision trees and the gradient boosting concept compared to rf xgboost has the advantage of improving prediction performance by controlling overfitting via regularization moreover xgboost has been known as faster than conventional gradient boosting in terms of processing speeds because of its compatibility with parallel computing chen and guestrin 2016 in fig 7 xgboost is trained by sequentially adding decision trees one by one let y ˆ i be the output result for instance at an arbitrary step i at the last step i n t i e the number of decision trees the output y ˆ n t can be expressed as follows y ˆ 0 0 y ˆ 1 f 1 x y ˆ o f 1 x y ˆ 2 f 1 x f 2 x y ˆ 1 f 2 x 2 y ˆ n t k 1 n t f k x y ˆ n t 1 f n t x where f k k 1 2 n t is the kth decision tree let us denote j the objective function of xgboost to be minimized j is the sum of the training loss and regularization terms as follows 3 j i 1 n p l y i y ˆ n t i k 1 n t ω f k where l is the loss function e g mean squared error mse y i is the actual output n p is the number of predictions and ω is the regularization function chen and guestrin 2016 as decision trees are added sequentially xgboost is frequently used for time series analyses ghosh et al 2021 lu et al 2020 yu et al 2020 3 3 deep neural network dnn the dnn algorithm consists of an input layer l i one or more hidden layers and an output layer l o lecun et al 2015 mathematically the dnn algorithm is expressed as follows 4 y i σ j 1 n n w ij x j β i where y i is the output at the ith neuron of the current hidden layer l h x j is the input from the jth neuron of the previous hidden layer l h 1 w ij is the weight between the ith neuron of l h and the jth neuron of l h 1 β i is the bias at the ith neuron of l h σ is the activation function and n n is the number of neurons in the l h 1 lecun et al 2015 the training process of dnn first randomly assigns the initial values of weights and biases in all layers second the forward propagation process is performed from l i to l o and the loss function e g mse is calculated third the weights and biases are sequentially updated through the back propagation process from l o to l i finally steps 2 3 are repeated until the improvement in the loss function value becomes insignificant lecun et al 2015 in this study the xavier initialization glorotnormal as the weight and bias initialization technique and the adaptive moment estimation adam optimizer were used to minimize the loss function value by initializing and updating the weights and biases respectively glorot and bengio 2010a kingma and ba 2014 3 4 long short term memory lstm lstm has been proposed to solve the limitation of long term memory caused by the vanishing gradient problem which means that the gradient value becomes too small and the learning performance of the model no longer improves cheng et al 2016 hochreiter 1998 hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 lecun et al 2015 in the lstm structure lstm cells are connected repeatedly similar to a chain fig 8 shows the schematic of an lstm cell the previous hidden state h t 1 carries past information into the lstm cell and the previous cell state c t 1 also provides longer information regarding past events the lstm cell consists of a cell state c t forget gate f t input gate i t and output gate o t let w f w i w o and w c be the weight matrices from the f t i t o t and c t to the input x t respectively u f u i u o and u c represent the weight matrices from the f t i t o t and c t to the hidden state h t respectively and b f b i b o and b c are defined as the bias of f t i t o t and c t respectively in f t the information of h t 1 and x t is combined and passed to the sigmoid activation function sigmoid between 0 and 1 if the output of f t is close to 0 it means to forget f t close to one means to keep mathematically f t can be expressed as follows 5 f t sigmoid w f x t u f h t 1 b f the next step is to decide what new information to store in c t for new information i t determines the updated value by passing the sigmoid and new candidate values c t are created through the hyperbolic tangent activation function tanh i t and c t can be expressed as follows 6 i t sigmoid w i x t u i h t 1 b i 7 c t tanh w c x t u c h t 1 b c as f t i t and c t are added into c t the c t 1 is updated as follows 9 c t f t c t 1 i t c t where means the pointwise multiplication of two vectors finally o t decides what information to pass to c t and h t is created by combining o t through which the sigmoid is passed and c t through the tanh as follows 10 o t sigmoid w o x t u o h t 1 b o 11 h t o t tanh c t if the output of i t and o t is close to zero it means that it is not essential information conversely an output close to one indicates critical information at each time point c t and h t are transferred to the next lstm cell by minimizing the results of the loss function and this training process is repeated until no more significant improvement in the loss function value is attained 3 5 development of the framework to prioritize total phosphorous management strategies using machine learning algorithms throughout this study all ml simulations were performed in python 3 7 environments rf and xgboost were conducted using the randomforestregressor from the scikit learn library pedregosa et al 2011 and xgbregressor from the xgboost library brownlee 2019 respectively dnn and lstm were performed on tensorflow 2 3 0 and keras 2 4 0 the architecture of each ml model rf xgboost dnn and lstm was designed as follows 1 the rf model with the number of decision trees the maximum depth of the decision tree and the maximum number of features to select 2 the xgboost model with the number of trees in the rf to fit the maximum tree depth for base learners boosting learning rarity and subsample ratio of columns when constructing each tree 3 the dnn model with two hidden layers and one dropout layer and 4 the lstm model composed of two lstm layers with dropout layer and recurrent dropout layer for designing the dnn model various activation functions were candidates for example linear sigmoid lecun et al 1991 2012 hyperbolic tangent tanh lecun et al 1991 2012 rectified linear unit relu lecun et al 2015 ramachandran et al 2017 softplus nair and hinton 2010 ramachandran et al 2017 exponential linear unit elu clevert et al 2016 ramachandran et al 2017 and scaled exponential linear unit selu klambauer et al 2017 ramachandran et al 2017 dropout and early stopping algorithms were used to prevent overfitting the dropout algorithm proposed by srivastava et al 2014 is a method that prevents overfitting by randomly dropping some neurons this study also employed an early stopping algorithm that forcibly terminated the training process when the test set error started to increase prechelt 1998a 1998b xavier initialization glorotnormal as a weight initialization technique and the adaptive moment estimation adam optimizer were used to minimize the results of the loss function by initializing and updating the weights and biases glorot and bengio 2010b kingma and ba 2014 4 results and discussion 4 1 hyperparameter tuning and performance evaluation of ml models we developed ml based models for predicting the tp concentration in euiam lake e tp hyperparameter tuning was conducted to optimize the performance of the ml models the set of optimal hyperparameter values for each ml model was determined using a grid search bergstra and bengio 2012 kim and shin 2020 a variety of cases were generated by combining hyperparameter values extracted from a uniform distribution and then evaluated bergstra and bengio 2012 kim and shin 2020 table 2 summarizes the hyperparameters with their ranges and intervals after the grid search the set of hyperparameter values with the minimum mean absolute error mae among 500 cases was selected as fit for each ml model the resultant hyperparameter values for the four ml models are listed in table 3 table 4 summarizes the prediction performance indicator values for the optimized ml models the prediction performance of ml models was evaluated through the following indicators pearson correlation coefficient r concordance correlation coefficient ccc coefficient of determination r2 mean squared error mse mae root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percentage error mape for all models their training performances were satisfactory as their r2 values were greater than 0 9 for the validation and test sets the lstm model outperformed the other ml models in terms of r 0 8853 and 0 9246 ccc 0 8875 and 0 9137 r2 0 7838 and 0 8549 mse 0 0017 and 0 0060 mae 0 0303 and 0 0511 rmse 0 0412 and 0 0775 and mape 30 79 and 24 57 fig 9 compares the actual and predicted e tp values obtained using ml models all the ml models accurately estimated the historical e tp data and captured their overall trends among the ml models this visual comparison indicates that the lstm model captured the rapid change in the e tp history because of high suspended solids and rainfall with the highest accuracy 4 2 comparison of seasonal performance obtained using ml models based on their prediction performances all ml models were deemed suitable for forecasting e tp using the chuncheon dam soyanggang dam tributary sewage treatment plant and meteorological data as input variables interestingly after dividing the prediction performance of all ml into three seasons spring summer and autumn e tp prediction performance of spring was found to be relatively low as mentioned in 2 2 1 winter data were excluded from this analysis due to freezing conditions to figure out the seasonal performance differences and their causes the seasonal model performance was compared as shown in fig 10 in terms of the prediction performance of the e tp the lstm model outperformed the other three ml models nevertheless the lstm model showed the lowest seasonal prediction performance in the spring fig 11 shows the taylor diagram of the ml models predicting e tp in each taylor diagram the standard deviation and correlation r2 values are marked as numbers for comparing the monthly prediction performance of the ml models overall the lstm model yielded the highest correlation among the four ml models interestingly the correlations were lower in march and april when we compared the monthly performance the performance indicator values of the lstm models were also less satisfactory although this model showed better correlations than the other three ml models when comparing fig 11 a with fig 11 b and c the standard deviation of spring is relatively smaller than those of summer and autumn this small standard deviation would be because spring is dry season in the korean peninsula in general this low rainfall resulted in low water flow affecting the model accuracy on the other hand most models showed satisfactory prediction performance in summer the rainy season although the lstm model showed the highest prediction performance in september the prediction performance decreased after october and showed a relatively low prediction performance in november as entering winter another dry season to investigate the effect of rainfall on the low prediction performance of the lstm model in dry season march april and november e tp and rainfall characteristics are compared in fig 12 the average monthly rainfall in the study region was estimated as 25 6 mm in march and 64 2 mm in april these estimates are relatively low compared to the average monthly rainfall range of 83 6 413 4 mm from may to september in addition the amount of water discharged from two upstream dams was relatively low because of the need to increase the water storage capacity of euiam dam before the farming season march to april considering that the paddy and field farming season spans from may to october the tp discharge from watersheds and neighboring reservoirs remained low because agricultural activities using artificial fertilizers were typically not carried out during spring march to april the spring season does not show dynamic changes in the tp concentration affected by environmental factors no fertilizer usage and low water discharge therefore comparatively low levels of rainfall and tp concentration during spring season resulted in low prediction performance in the four ml models figs 10 and 11 based on the seasonal characteristics of prediction performance we claim that tp management efforts in euiam lake should focus on the season with high rainfall and flow from the upstream dam may to october and mid range hydrologic conditions ranging from 0 to 60 of the total flow 4 3 gradient based analysis of lstm model to prioritize management strategies the lstm which exhibited the highest prediction performance among the four ml models was used to derive the priority management factor among the influential factors to manage tp concentrations in other words the gradient based analysis was conducted to quantify the contribution of each input variable to the final output e tp to target and prioritize the factors that most affected e tp in the gradient based analysis the contributions were calculated as gradients obtained from the differential operation of the input sequence to the prediction the gradienttape api supported by tensorflow 2 0 was used to compute and capture the gradients bisong 2019 campesato 2020 the implementation of the gradient based analysis consisted of three steps 1 use the gradienttape api to capture gradients on 40 inputs in the lstm model 2 generate gradients with the same shape as the input sequence as the training set consisted of 390 data points in the time series for 40 inputs in this case study 390 gradients were sequentially generated for each input 3 obtain the contribution of each input as the average of gradients over the time dimension the higher the average gradient was the more influential the input contribution to the output i e e tp was fig 13 illustrates the results of the gradient based analysis of the lstm model for 40 input variables to prioritize management strategies based on the gradient based analysis the primary and secondary priority factors corresponding to the top 10 were the tp concentrations of the two upstream dams c tp and s tp respectively these two tp concentrations were followed by the ss concentrations of the upstream dams c ss and s ss this result is consistent with the behavior of nutrients such as fertilizers phosphorus and nitrogen adsorbed onto soil particles as soil particles flow into the system during intense rainfall events in summer xiao et al 2013 the tp concentration of the sewage treatment plant tb tp was also analyzed as a high management priority however tb tp concentrations ranged from 0 03 to 0 20 mg l for approximately 95 of the year and was less affected by seasonal fluctuations therefore tb tp was considered relatively low importance compared to the tp concentration in the upstream dam the other two factors water temperature of soyanggang dam s wt and met rainfall i e 7 d sum rainfall show high gradient after the upstream tp and ss concentrations because these two factors were related to meteorological phenomena and difficult to control through dam operation management and upstream pollutant inflow they were excluded from the discussion of management priorities in addition the ss concentration of the upstream dam is known to be difficult to manage in the field because fluctuations in the concentration hugely depend on the presence or absence of rainfall the intensity of rainfall and the duration of rainfall therefore it is most effective for managing e tp to superintend the tp concentration c tp and s tp of two upstream dams based on the gradient based analysis result of the lstm model our results have significance in that the contribution of each factor is quantified for an efficient and systematic water quality management of the study region 4 4 field practical implications in water management and future perspectives the discharge from neighboring reservoirs might affect the downstream water quality in different ways depending on the environmental conditions of the targeted region water quality determinants and operation scenarios of neighboring reservoirs of serial impoundment chung et al 2008 previous research has suggested that the water quality of downstream water bodies depends on the relative concentration of nutrients between the water reserved in the dam and downstream of the dam malatre and gosse 1995 han and an 2008 also concluded that the water quality of downstream water systems are closely linked to flushing from upstream reservoirs therefore to achieve the optimal water quality in a study region with a complex topography and distinct seasonal water temperature and rainfall characteristics it is essential to carefully designate management priorities through contribution analysis and determine quantitative reduction levels in terms of water quality management policy euiam lake is under the total maximum daily loads tmdls regulation to maintain its tp concentration e tp under 0 02 mg l as a target criterion for brevity let us call e tp 0 02 mg l the tmdls criterion because of the tmdls regulation it is necessary to make a water quality management plan by determining the management priority and quantitative reduction to achieve the tmdls criterion in this case study the priorities influencing e tp were analyzed using the lstm model which previously accounted for seasonal characteristics more accurately than the other ml models based on the lstm model s gradient based analysis the priority factors corresponding to the top 10 for e tp were the tp c tp and s tp and ss c ss and s ss concentrations of the two upstream dams quantitative analyses were conducted to determine the reduced levels of the priority factors c tp s tp c ss and s ss required to achieve the tmdls criterion to account for uncertainty in the quantitative analysis raychaudhuri 2008 we performed a monte carlo simulation to determine the quantitative management levels of c tp s tp c ss and s ss the monte carlo simulation procedure is as follows 1 the lstm model was used as the predictive model i e the proxy model of the monte carlo simulation 2 random samples were generated for the monte carlo simulation to generate random samples based on field data 1000 random samples following a normal distribution were generated using the mean and standard deviation of input variables for each year from 2007 to 2020 14 years this collection of sample data yielded 14 000 1000 14 years data points fig b1 shows the density plots of the smoothed data 546 data points and random data for the input variables because the shapes of the density plots of the smoothed and random data are similar random data adequately reflects the actual phenomenon 3 e tp of 14 000 were predicted using the lstm model and random data and the distribution of c tp s tp c ss and s ss was investigated based on the management goal i e tmdls criterion from the distribution of four priority factors q1 q2 and q3 are selected to calculate the reduction concentration and percentages to achieve the management goal tmdls criterion e tp 0 02 mg l where q1 q2 and q3 refer to the lower quartile median and upper quartile in each distribution q2 and interquartile range q3 q1 can be considered as representative value and descriptive spread of the distribution of four priority factors respectively fig 14 illustrates violin plots to visualize the distribution of the priority factors based on the tmdls criterion table 5 summarizes their statistical parameters it was estimated that c tp and s tp concentrations should be reduced from 0 0041 mg l to 0 0139 mg l 34 5 48 3 and 0 0039 mg l to 0 0218 mg l 41 1 66 9 respectively in other words it means that the reduction of s tp is required more than that of c tp to achieve the target criteria this is consistent with the results of the slope based analysis of the lstm model that c tp affects e tp more sensitively than s tp it was also estimated that c ss and s ss concentrations should be reduced from 0 2252 mg l to 4 2213 mg l 13 8 60 8 and 0 3866 mg l to 6 8434 mg l 36 8 80 0 respectively this result means that the reduction degree of the ss concentration to achieve the target criterion of e tp is required to be greater than that of the tp concentration as mentioned above the ss concentration in the study area varies greatly depending on the presence intensity and duration of rainfall therefore it is judged that there is uncertainty in the field management of ss concentration for effective water quality management through the application of ml models we developed the robust predictive model for the study site which showed complex topographical characteristics caused by serial impoundments as well as distinct seasonal characteristics in water quality based on the gradient based analysis of the lstm model we generated data for each priority element c tp c ss s tp s ss through monte carlo simulation in order to build their data distributions subsequently we determined the quantitative reduction level for achieving the tmdls criterion of euiam lake as a consequence it is expected that the management priority and reduction level to achieve e tp suggested in this regional case study can be utilized as an efficient tool in the on site water quality management policy the ml model can be readily constructed and operated by environmental engineers and decision makers as a useful tool for water quality prediction in surface water system with already measured water quality data additional analysis such as the gradient based analysis can provide interpretations for the reasons that most affected water quality of the surface water system the ml model techniques also have an advantage to better understand a non linear relationship between variable water quality parameters nonetheless to establish a water quality management policy based on machine learning some limitations still remain 1 the developed ml model should be regularly updated with the data immediately available from the measurements since the ml model technique is dependent on the data availability and 2 it is necessary to count on the environmental variability such as the intensity of rainfall and the duration of rainfall caused by climatic change it would be future works to investigate towards involving climatic variables to predict water quality changes and determine management priorities using developed ml model further studies are also needed to expand the variables that can take into account environmental variability and accumulate continuous monitoring data which can increase applicability and model performance 5 conclusions this study determined the factors that must be prioritized to control the tp concentration of euiam lake using ml based analyses including rf xgboost dnn and lstm the dataset consisted of 40 input variables and one output variable acquired from the three dams i e euiam dam chuncheon dam and soyanggang dam of serial impoundment a tributary a sewage treatment plant and a meteorological station between march 2007 and november 2020 among the four ml methods assessed herein the lstm model was the optimal approach because it rendered the most accurate predictions of e tp the prediction performance of the lstm model was characterized by outstanding r values 0 8853 0 9246 ccc values 0 8875 0 9137 r2 values 0 7838 0 8549 mse 0 0017 0 0060 mae 0 0303 0 0511 rmse 0 0412 0 0806 and mape 24 57 65 72 all ml models showed acceptable performance in forecasting e tp the accuracy of this model for predicting e tp in the spring season was below our expectations nevertheless the lstm model outperformed the other three ml models in predicting e tp of the spring season despite exhibiting the lowest prediction performance in march april and november the low prediction performance of the ml models during spring was attributed to the comparatively low levels of rainfall and tp concentration during this season based on this result this season was excluded from the analysis of dynamic tp concentration changes affected by environmental factors in this case study based on these predicted seasonal characteristics management strategies to control tp concentrations in euiam lake should focus on months with high rainfall and flow from the upstream dam in terms of water quality management policy euiam lake is regulated by the tmdls while maintaining e tp under 0 02 mg l as the target tmdls criterion therefore to achieve this tmdls criterion this study presented a water quality management plan with respect to input variables obtained from serial impoundment by determining the management priority and quantitative reduction the priorities influencing e tp were analyzed using the lstm model which has previously been demonstrated to describe seasonal characteristics more accurately than other ml models based on the lstm model gradient based analysis the priority factors corresponding to the top 10 for e tp were the tp c tp and s tp and ss c ss and s ss concentrations of the two upstream dams the distribution of c tp s tp c ss and s ss according to the tmdls criterion was analyzed using the monte carlo simulation as a result to achieve the tmdls criterion the c tp and s tp concentrations was approximately predicted to be decreased from 0 0041 mg l to 0 0139 mg l 34 5 48 3 and from 0 0039 mg l to 0 0218 mg l respectively it was also estimated that c ss and s ss concentrations should be reduced from 0 2252 mg l to 4 2213 mg l 13 8 60 8 and 0 3866 mg l to 6 8434 mg l 36 8 80 0 respectively our findings indicate that a robust predictive model can be developed for a study site with distinct seasonal rainfall and temperature characteristics and large seasonal changes in water quality thus facilitating the selection of management priorities therefore it is expected the proposed approach to be used as a cost efficient tool for water quality management in the field by quantitatively deriving the reduction level of the selected priority credit authorship contribution statement

7961,study region lower nelson river basin manitoba canada study focus hydroelectricity makes up almost 97 of electricity generated in manitoba of which over 70 of its generation capacity is installed along the lower nelson river lnr in this study 19 climate projections representing 87 of climatic variability over hudson bay drainage basin are applied to coupled hydrologic operations models to estimate water supply and hydropower generation potential changes under future climates new hydrological insights for the region future inflow to the forebay of the main hydropower generating stations along lnr is expected to increase in spring and summer but decrease in winter and fall consequently hydropower generation potential is projected to increase for spring the historical flood season which may lead to reduced reservoir inflow retention efficiency in extremely dry climatic simulations winter seasons see a reduction in reservoir inflow and hydropower generation potential up to 35 and 37 in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 respectively projected changes in reservoir inflow and hydropower generation potential continue to diverge over time with dry scenarios becoming drier and wet becoming wetter yielding high basin climate sensitivity and uncertainty with system supply and generation potential despite the presence of statistically significant individual trends and changes there is a low agreement within the climate ensemble analysis of system robustness shows adjustment of the operations along lnr should be considered over time to better leverage changing seasonal

1300 gw in 2019 more than doubling in size from 625 gw in 1995 in 2019 hydropower achieved a record of an annual generation of 4306 twh the greatest contribution from a renewable energy source in history iha 2021 hydropower produced almost 2 3 of the world s renewable electricity in 2018 with hydropower generation and capacities in the far north alaska canada and much of scandinavia are actively expanding cherry et al 2017 canada has the fourth largest installed hydropower capacity worldwide 81 39 gw out of 1308 gw with hydropower making up approximately 61 of the total electricity generation and 55 of total installed generation capacity iha 2021 the province of manitoba generates almost 97 of its electricity through hydropower operations the highest percentage nationally natural resources canada 2017 and with over 70 of the provincial hydropower generation capacity residing within the lower nelson river basin lnrb located in the northern region manitoba hydro 2018 as hydropower generation depends on reliable water supply adapting to changing climate and meeting energy demand are common challenges for hydropower operations globally liu et al 2020 from 1984 2016 canada observed a rapid increase in mean annual temperature of 1 7 c nationally roughly double the global mean increase and 1 9 c across the prairies where the nelson and churchill river basins are located bush and lemmen 2020 according to the high emission representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 the canadian prairies could expect an increase in annual mean temperature of up to 2 3 c and 6 5 c respectively from 2031 to 2050 and 2081 2100 relative to 1986 2005 based on the median of a 40 simulation ensemble from 18 gcms the ncrb is projected to experience a 2 7 c increase in annual mean temperature in 2040 2068 compared to 1981 2010 period with a strong agreement in the direction of projected change amongst the future climate scenarios manitoba hydro 2020 the increase in mean annual

governing the snowmelt freshet despite the moderate to high model agreement for increasing mean annual temperature and precipitation across the ncrb manitoba hydro 2020 the integrated effects on streamflow are complex debeer et al 2016 leading to significantly lower model agreement in the projected direction and amount of runoff and streamflow discharge in particular the hudson bay complex where lnrb is located is a highly climate sensitive region with a low streamflow projection agreement macdonald et al 2018 which warrants an investigation on the effects of climate change on hydropower operations in lnrb studies that examine the impact of climate change on hydropower systems have largely been focused on analyzing flow ensembles using stand alone hydrologic models with climate forcing generated from one or more global climate models gcms greenhouse gas emissions scenarios ghges and downscaling methods dsms the evaluation of the associated impact on hydropower system has been mostly limited to focusing on basins with single or multiple parallel reservoir operations using operations models or optimization algorithms chhuon et al 2016 eum and simonovic 2010 lanini et al 2014 park and kim 2014 or on complex basins with simplified equations to represent reservoir operations carvajal et al 2017 patro et al 2018 or one way coupling of hydrologic and operations or optimization model simulating system based on given boundary flow condition ahn et al 2016 minville et al 2009 there are few studies that examine a cascaded hydropower system with dynamic feedback between hydrologic and operations models i e updating system operations and forebay storage based on timeseries inflows or a study on the effects of climate change on hydropower operations though some studies have examined global to regional to local scale impacts of climate hydrology and hydropower operations anghileri et al 2018 hamududu and killingtveit 2016 timalsina et al 2015 dynamic coupling between the hydrologic and systems operations models remains elusive despite recommendations for research to proceed in this direction schaefli 2015 and even fewer have focused directly on northern manitoba in this study the projected 2021 2070 trends and changes in reservoir inflow and power generation potential of the lnrb under 19 cmip5 simulations are compared to 1981 2010 results under historical 1981 2010 system settings and operations reservoir inflow and power generation were simulated using two coupled hydrologic operations models watflood modsim and hec hms modsim which simulate basin water balance and system operations using different structural arrangements facilitating model uncertainty analyses in particular this study seeks to answer following research questions 1 will changes in future reservoir supply and hydropower generation potential be statistically significant with high confidence for the lnrb 2 what are the implications of projected changes and uncertainty on future system operations this study is one of the recent hydrologic operations model coupling initiatives designed to identify shortages and or surplus in water supply and power generation potential of the lnrb system originating within the global water futures integrated modelling programme for canada program global water futures 2021 changes are analyzed for individual climate projections and for the ensemble of projections to demonstrate the confidence i e agreement and amount of evidence in projected trends and changes as per the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc directives ipcc 2014 the identified shortages or surplus will help inform mid term operation system planning and optimization 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area the lnrb fig 1 covers 90 500 km2 of land and surface water area and is an outlet basin of the larger nelson churchill river basin 1 4 million km2 draining the canadian rockies across the prairies parts of north central united states and parts of north western ontario into the hudson bay the majority of the lnrb lies in the canadian shield underlain by shallow or exposed bedrock the basin is located in a sporadic permafrost region 10 50 permafrost with the most downstream portion in extensive discontinuous permafrost 50 90 smith et al 2015 the lnrb is characterized by a low topographic gradient with an average basin slope of 0 037 due to lake agassiz glaciation surface depressions such as small lakes channelized lakes and wetlands are extensive throughout the basin holmes 2016 the lnrb lies in a sub arctic continental climate region characterized by cool summers cold winters and moderate precipitation and humidity holmes 2016 lilhare et al 2019 the basin mean daily temperature varies north south with a mean temperature of 3 7 c in gillam and 0 4 c in cross lake dictating the basin s cold region hydrologic response the snowfall free period i e rain only is short june to september with mean daily air temperature remaining sub zero for the majority of a year november to april environment and climate change canada 2020 the basin receives on average 500 mm of annual precipitation with 69 rainfall and 31 snowfall the highest monthly precipitation occurs in july with approximately 16 of annual precipitation while the lowest monthly precipitation occurs between november and april annual evapotranspiration ranges from approximately 300 mm to 350 mm across the lnrb environment and climate change canada 2020 smith et al 2015 2 2 basin streamflow and regulation there are 12 wsc gauges throughout the basin eight of which account for tributary flow and four gauges along the main channel s the nelson and the burntwood rivers carry water diverted from the churchill river into the lnrb through the rat river and notigi control structure cs and are the major rivers within the basin merging at split lake on average the lnrb flow measured at the long spruce generating station gs which is the nearest water survey of canada wsc gauge to the hudson bay outlet is composed of 57 contribution by the nelson river west channel controlled by the jenpeg gs 10 contribution from the unregulated nelson river east channel and 23 contribution at the notigi cs only a small percentage 10 of the annual flow observed at its outlet is generated within the lnrb water survey of canada 2020 both the nelson and churchill rivers have relatively low regulated seasonal streamflow variability the lnrb is a highly regulated basin with two control structures jenpeg and notigi and six completed hydropower gs wuskwatim jenpeg kelsey kettle long spruce and limestone the first unit of the seventh and the newest hydropower station on the nelson river keeyask gs commenced operations in february 2021 with station completed expected in 2022 a summary of the seven hydropower generating stations within the lnrb is listed in table 1 over 70 of manitoba hydro s total hydropower generation capacity 5228 mw manitoba hydro 2018 is on the lower nelson river and three of manitoba hydro s largest generating stations kettle long spruce and limestone are located near the outlet of the lnrb to hudson bay in this study wuskwatim and limestone gs are considered part of historic operations although both gs came online after 1981 this is a reasonable assumption because the focus of this study is to compare the historic and future hydropower generation potential rather than the produced generation generation potential at keeyask was not considered in this study because the gs is not part of historic 1981 2010 operations and no discharge data were available a unique characteristic of the lnrb hydropower system is that it mostly operates as a cascade run of the river ror system with reservoirs of little storage capacity for this study ror is defined as hydropower stations that do not have immediate control of monthly or larger reservoir storage the major lakes storages affecting lnrb operations are southern indian lake sil and lake winnipeg located upstream of the generating stations their releases at notigi sil and jenpeg lake winnipeg contribute approximately 23 and 67 of the annual flows at the hudson bay outlet respectively release operations work together to optimize downstream flows to major generating stations as there is a multi week time delay between major system storage and the gs manitoba hydro 2015 table 2 2 3 climate data an ensemble of plausible future climate simulations was chosen by braun et al 2021 and has been earlier described by macdonald et al 2018 for the baysys project with the support of manitoba hydro there was interest by manitoba hydro in understanding the impact the baysys projected climate changes could have on generation potential which this study is designed to address the ensemble consists of 19 climate simulations generated from 14 gcms and 2 rcps 4 5 and 8 5 selected from 154 simulations from the cmip5 ensemble through k means clustering for the 2021 2070 period braun et al 2021 clustering and consequently simulation selection were based on changes in annual and seasonal mean temperature and precipitation spatially averaged over the hudson bay drainage basin domain the resulting ensemble represents 87 of the variability in the climate reference period 1981 2010 and the future period 2041 2070 over this domain which includes lnrb the clustering approach reduced the number of climate simulations and thus the computational cost of the analysis while maintaining adequate uncertainty representation of the entire ensemble the selected 19 climate simulations were bias corrected using the quantile mapping approach by mpelasoka and chiew using hydrogfd as a baseline to be consistent with the hydrologic model forcing applied in this study berg et al 2017 mpelasoka and chiew 2009 this bias corrected climate data was provided by the ouranos consortium for more information please refer to braun et al 2021 a detailed list of the ipcc climate model scenarios included in this study as inherited from the baysys project are found in table 1 of braun et al 2021 historically approximately 90 of the annual flow observed at the outlet of the lower nelson river is generated upstream of the lnrb therefore a review of upstream climate conditions is necessary to understand projected changes in water supply and generation potential upstream of the lnrb the climatic condition varies across ncrb annual mean temperature of 1981 2010 across ncrb ranges from 6 5 c northeast to 6 1 c southwest while precipitation ranges from 323 mm in the west to 777 mm in the east manitoba hydro 2020 to summarize the changes in climatic variables for ncrb simulated precipitation temperature evapotranspiration and runoff from h hype work were used to compute a single area weighted mean monthly value to represent ncrb the projected changes in the upstream lnrb climate conditions are analyzed in section 3 1 2 4 models 2 4 1 model coupling three hydrologic models and an operations model were used to simulate the river reservoir system and operations in this study connected via a custom wrapper fig 2 as the lnrb is located downstream of the ncrb a continental scale hydrologic model called hype hydrological predictions for the environment was used to compute the upstream contribution of ncrb coming into jenpeg gs and notigi cs two basin scale hydrologic models watflood and hec hms were used to simulate lnrb hydrology and local inflows for the operations model to estimate hydrologic uncertainty pokorny et al 2021 found that choice of hydrologic model was more influential on uncertainty and hydrologic outcomes than the parameterization of individual models hence why we focus on model structural uncertainty in this study model setups and calibrations in this study were inherited from pokorny et al 2021 where a detailed explanation of model structural and accompanying parameter uncertainty can be found an operations model modsim dss was used to compute reservoir operations and hydropower generation which cannot be computed by hydrologic models the basin scale hydrologic models and the operations model were coupled using a custom coded python wrapper the python wrapper iteratively runs and transfers reservoir inflow and outflow data between the hydrologic and operations models by modifying model input files reservoir inflow and outflow time series are exchanged at three locations within the lnrb kelsey wuskwatim and kettle gs these locations were chosen to 1 represent the churchill and nelson river contributions wuskwatim gs downstream of notigi cs and kelsey gs downstream of jenpeg gs and 2 the influence on downstream stations release from kelsey and wuskwatim gs impacting inflow at kettle gs release from kettle gs governing inflow to limestone and long spruce gs the wrapper terminates the iterative model run when specified reservoir release from the operations model converges see kim 2020 for more information 2 4 2 hydrological models hype is a semi distributed hydrologic model lindström et al 2010 for simulating runoff and water quality simulations with a focus on simulating large scale domains e g europe basins and sub basins are discretized by land use land cover lulc soil type and elevation hype has various sub processes well suited for cold region hydrology such as snow accumulation and melt freezing and thawing of soil and frozen soil infiltration the h hype hudson bay hype configuration used in this study is from the baysys project and was extensively calibrated using the same input forcing as here as described by previous studies stadnyk et al 2020 tefs et al 2021 h hype simulation over the ncrb was calibrated and validated over 1981 2010 simulated 1971 2013 stadnyk et al 2020 with a new reservoir regulation routine developed using 2001 2010 reservoir data for jenpeg gs and notigi cs operations at the daily time step the nse values are 0 77 and 0 09 kge of 0 74 and 0 33 respectively and percent bias values are 1 1 and 0 4 respectively for 1981 2010 tefs et al 2021 though notigi operations show low nse performance it should be noted that this was a significant improvement over previous models e g a hype without reservoir operations that this is a two outlet lake and that it is the timing of operations less so the volume that is problematic in this case tefs et al 2021 hec hms hydrologic modeling system developed by the hydrologic engineering center is a conceptual semi distributed hydrologic model developed by the united states army corps of engineers u s army corps of engineers 2016 it is designed to simulate the precipitation runoff process of dendritic basins in a wide range of geographical locations hec hms has several methods for simulating each hydrological process giving it flexibility in adapting to various basins the hec hms model used in this study simulates forebay operations and therefore considers reservoir forebays as reservoirs table s1 the model did not account for reservoir evaporation nor seepage as losses from forebay as insignificant the model utilized the elevation storage discharge curve method to simulate reservoir operations version 4 2 1 the hec hms configuration with the best basin average kge performance over 1981 2010 for the entire lnrb was selected from behavioral models pokorny et al 2021 the average kge nse values are 0 68 0 46 for 12 wsc gauges and 0 87 0 82 for mh regulated reservoirs for the period of 1981 2010 watflood is a physically based distributed hydrologic model kouwen 2020 with a focus on utilizing remotely sensed land cover data dems and numerical weather data for simulating the hydrological processes across the lnrb watflood with the 0 167 longitude x 0 1 latitude 11 km by 11 km at the centroid of the lnrb grid cell size was used the waflood model considered lakes and reservoirs by grids identified as water from land cover data and therefore considered both the reservoir forebay and the lake feeding the forebay as a single reservoir the watflood model computed open water evaporation the model utilized user defined polynomial or power function to simulate reservoir operations watflood used the grouped response units grus approach where the runoff response was calculated from each hydrologically significant group in each grid and routed downstream similar to hec hms the waflood configuration with the best basin average kge performance over 1981 2010 for the entire lnrb behavioral models pokorny et al 2021 the average kge nse values are 0 77 0 65 for 12 wsc gauges and 0 88 0 83 for mh regulated reservoirs 2 4 3 operations model modsim dss hereafter modsim is a water resources operation model developed at the colorado state university labadie 2006 modsim is capable of simulating complex surface water network systems and water allocation according to water demands and rights and governmental regulations using the network flow optimization algorithm the river reservoir system is represented as a network of nodes e g demand channel junctions reservoirs sink and links e g rivers and channels given a water supply system and user specified constraints modsim has an internal optimization operator to allocate water by satisfying physical and operational constraints a unique feature of modsim is the ability for users to customize any knowledge based operating policies or rule curves through user supplemented code in c net or vb net language using custom code editor unlike the hydrologic models modsim cannot simulate the rainfall runoff process and thus all tributary flows must be provided as input forcing from the hydrologic model therefore the modsim configuration represents only the river reservoir system along the main stem of the lower nelson river an existing operational model configuration version 8 5 0 was used beiraghdar 2019 the average nse values are 0 89 for natural lakes and 0 78 for mh regulated reservoirs 2 5 analysis conventions the simulation period was divided into three 30 year periods for inter period comparisons to identify changes in reservoir supply and hydropower generation potential historical baseline 1981 2010 near future 2021 2050 and mid future 2041 2070 changes in reservoir supply and hydropower

system kelsey on nelson river wuskwatim on burntwood river and kettle that receives combined flow as each reservoir represents the respective inflow supply of the major rivers the projected reservoir inflows were examined both as an ensemble using ensemble mean values as well as individual climate simulation to discern model confidence or the degree of the climate simulation agreement among the 19

into the lnrb and to better understand the driving factors for changing reservoir inflow and hydropower generation potential along lower nelson river 3 1 1 air temperature ensemble mean annual basin temperature is projected to increase by 1 5 c and 3 2 c in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 respectively mean seasonal and monthly temperatures are likely to virtually certain to increase for all seasons table 3 warming is most pronounced during colder months winter and spring fig s1a relative to warmer months similar to previously reported findings vincent et al 2018 2012 the 30 year ensemble mean winter temperature increases the most i e 1 7 c and 4 1 c in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 respectively and the 30 year ensemble mean summer and fall temperatures increase the least 1 2 c and 2 7 c and 1 1 c and 2 6 c in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 respectively most extreme increases in 30 year mean temperatures are projected to occur in spring 3 8 c and 8 4 c in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 respectively 3 1 2 precipitation projected ensemble mean annual precipitation is very likely to increase by 4 and 12 in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 respectively fig s2 which agrees with projected increases in annual precipitation across the prairies bush and lemmen 2020 manitoba hydro 2020 spring shows the greatest increase both in terms of the anomaly and percent change in precipitation relative to the 1981 2010 ensemble mean table 4 fig s2 mean summer precipitation in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 are about as likely as not to increase resulting from low ensemble agreement fig s3 which has been previously reported for the ncrb and lower latitude regions of canada bush and lemmen 2020 manitoba hydro 2020 stadnyk et al 2019 3 1 3 evapotranspiration evapotranspiration is projected to increase year round into the future with ensemble mean annual evapotranspiration increasing by 6 and 12 in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 respectively table 4 fig s2 similar to precipitation spring evapotranspiration shows the greatest increases but also the greatest uncertainty fig s3 3 1 4 runoff runoff is non linearly related to precipitation and temperature and the corresponding high simulation agreement for annual increases in both precipitation and evapotranspiration result in low agreement on the direction of change in ncrb runoff that flows into the lnrb the percent increase in precipitation and evapotranspiration are comparable fig 3 but the rate of the normalized anomaly is higher for evapotranspiration compared to precipitation due to the higher spread standard deviation in the mean annual precipitation within the ensemble fig s2 intuitively although ensemble mean annual runoff increases over time it does so at a much slower rate of increase because increases in precipitation and evapotranspiration balance one another table 4 shows the ncrb is about as likely as not to experience a slightly drier 3 and slightly wetter 2 period in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 respectively compared to the historic baseline the mean monthly runoff is predicted about as likely as not or likely to decrease in the open water season may sept the greatest percent increase in runoff is projected for winter compared to 1981 2010 table 4 fig s3 the large percent increase is due to the magnitude of change is of a similar magnitude of historic runoff the greatest magnitude of seasonal runoff anomaly occurs in spring the average magnitude of winter runoff anomaly 0 3 km3 and 0 8 km3 is only a fraction of spring runoff anomaly 0 6 km3 and 2 0 km3 3 2 projected changes in reservoir inflow and hydropower generation 3 2 1 projected trends in reservoir inflow and power generation potential examining the ensemble mean annual and seasonal inflow volumes not shown the reservoir inflow to kelsey nelson river wuskwatim burntwood river and kettle combined gs show statistically significant increasing trends in annual spring and summer inflows but a statistically significant decreasing trend in fall inflows winter inflow shows a statistically insignificant decreasing trend table s2 and consequently the ensemble mean hydropower generation potential shows a decreasing trend in winter and fall seasons across the lnrb table s3 it was found that spring inflows to wuskwatim and kettle gs are likely to increase when accounting for statistical significance table 5 however other seasonal inflows to all the three gss are about as likely as not to show increasing or decreasing trends similarly the spring hydropower generation potential of the three largest gss kettle limestone and long spruce gs along lnr is likely to show increasing trends while other seasonal hydropower generation potentials are about as likely as not to show increasing or decreasing trends the similar trends between reservoir inflow and hydropower generation potential are not surprising as hydropower generation along the nelson river is operated as ror with relatively insignificant storage capacities while statistically significant trends are detected overall there is insufficient 66 simulation agreement as an ensemble to determine a conclusive direction of the trend this in itself is an important finding for hydropower operators who will likely need to operate the system under considerable uncertainty in the future 3 2 2 projected shift in reservoir inflow and hydropower generation potential the distribution or probability density function of ensemble mean inflow volume at kettle gs is expected to decrease in winter and fall but to increase in summer and spring both in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 relative to the 1981 2010 baseline indicated by blue fill for statistically significant shifts table 6 however as with the mk analysis table 5 examination of individual climate simulation agreement suggests low agreement on the existence and direction of a statistically significant shift in the distribution of inflow volume amongst the 19 member ensemble it is about as likely as not or unlikely to see statistically significant changes in the distributions of mean annual or seasonal reservoir inflow volumes between the three 30 year periods table 6 fig s4 particularly in winter djf there is little change in the median inflow but significant uncertainty in moving from the historic to future periods indicative of a larger operating range conversely in spring mam fall son there is increasing variability however also statistically significant increases decreases in mean inflow fig s4 table 6 summer jja results in a significant increase in seasonal inflow variability as well as both increasing and decreasing mean inflows again pointing to more challenging future operating regimes the low agreement among inflow projections in response to relatively consistent climate projections points to a highly sensitive to climatic change basin water supply the lack of agreement in the projected change to the distribution of inflow volume is an artefact of insufficient 66 ensemble agreement rather than insignificant changes projected by the climate simulations an inter period comparison of the distributions of reservoir inflow for mr3r41 statistically significant wetter future ialr81 statistically significant drier future and the ensemble are shown on fig 4 each of the 19 simulations driven by members of the climate ensemble starts near the historic ensemble mean 1981 2010 and shifts toward either lower or higher inflow over time as a result the ensemble distribution spread increases further into the future overall there are higher increases in the volume of inflow projected under wetter simulations relative to smaller decreases in inflow volume by drier scenarios contributing to an overall insignificant increasing trend for the ensemble mean shifts in hydropower generation potential were examined by 1 comparing the percentage of years in the ensemble and 2 the number of individual simulations which likely exceed the historical 30 year ensemble annual or seasonal median hydropower generation potential threshold value on an annual basis the overall number of years within the 19 member ensemble exceeding the historical threshold during the 2021 2050 period decreases compared to the 1981 2010 and 2041 2070 periods winter and summer hydropower generation potential exceedance rates decrease in 2021 2050 but then increase in 2041 2070 while spring and fall exceedance rates continue to increase and decrease respectively over time examination of the likelihood of any individual ensemble member exceeding the threshold value indicates the detected shift in percent of years for the ensemble originates from specific climate scenarios rather than from an ensemble trend the number of simulations likely to exceed the historical threshold is projected to remain the same table 7 except for spring although the magnitude of year to year hydropower generation potential reduces relative to the 1981 2010 baseline the reduction in year to year exceedance originates from individual climate simulations increasing hydropower generation potential is projected in spring both as an ensemble and from individual simulations table 7 indicating that increasing hydropower generation potential occurs both across multiple simulations and within individual simulations polarization towards drier or wetter futures is also observed when analyzing annual and seasonal 30 year means of reservoir inflow and hydropower generation potential flow simulations derived from dry scenarios ialr81 micr81 and mier81 shift to lower reservoir inflow over time whereas wetter projections inrr41 mr3r41 and mr3r81 result in increasing reservoir inflow in general however agreement on the direction of change for the 30 year mean reservoir inflow is evenly split except for spring and fall seasons where more simulations agreed in an increase and decrease respectively polarization and general equal split between increasing and decreasing inflow volume changes cancel each other out within the ensemble leading to a lower magnitude of change 10 compared to changes among individual climate simulations table 8 percent changes detected for annual and seasonal mean inflow and hydropower generation potential follow similar patterns as indicated for kettle gs table 9 the highest reduction in the ensemble mean seasonal potential occurs in fall 7 and the highest reduction under an individual climate simulation occurs in winter 35 spring and summer ensemble mean hydropower generation potentials are increasing through time 3 3 uncertainty due to the hydrologic model selection the two hydrologic models chosen in this study were strategically selected because they are of differing structural configurations and hence process representation watflood is a discretized distributed and physically based model while the hec hms configuration make it a lumped conceptual model with opposing structural and process representation configurations it is possible to examine hydrologic uncertainty within the lower nelson river stemming from model choice impacting both runoff inflow and hydropower generation potential the annual and seasonal mean percent differences in reservoir inflow and hydropower generation potential resulting from choice of hydrologic model is less than 6 table 9 both models result in the identification of similar trend results both annually and seasonally tables s2 s3 it should be noted that the relatively small magnitude of hydrologic model structural uncertainty is influenced here by basin selection with both watflood and hec hms models run using the same upstream boundary inflow generated by hype the lnrb is an outlet sub basin of ncrb and historically approximately 90 of lnrb outflow is generated upstream therefore the uncertainty introduced by model choice for the lnrb is likely lower than if the study had considered a headwater basin with no upstream inflow forcing watflood simulates higher reservoir inflow in winter and spring and lower inflow for summer and fall periods relative to hec hms table 9 on an annual scale the two models exhibit similar reservoir inflow volume response with the most significant differences in inflow occur in summer during the historic period 1981 2010 the oscillating seasonal difference between ice on and ice off season table 9 is mainly due to the differences in structural configuration between these two models and how they represent lakes and evaporation losses watflood simulates a greater reservoir extent and therefore higher losses through reservoir evaporation watflood also considers the entire water body the reservoir forebay and the lake feeding the forebay as a reservoir and computes open water evaporation for the entire water body watflood computes open water evaporation only when there is no snow cover kouwen and stadnyk 2017 in contrast the current hec hms model setup for the lnrb does not account for open water evaporation in its reservoir computation in addition to only considering the forebay as the reservoir representing only 1 4 of the actual lake area table 2 watflood therefore computes higher water loss through evaporation which is internally subtracted from upstream inflows into the reservoir and which leads to a reduced reservoir inflow volume during the summer and fall periods historically the snow free period in the lnrb is relatively short generally occurring between may and october environment and climate change canada 2019 and there are significantly more sunlight hours in summer than winter due to the lnrb s high latitude watflood under estimates reservoir inflow during the snow free period jja and son fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 projected change and agreement in inflow and power generation potential statistical analyses of annual and seasonal reservoir inflow and hydropower generation potential indicate that while there are statistically significant shifts and trends among the 19 member ensemble there is insufficient agreement to achieve statistical significance or a likely direction of trend for reservoir supply and resulting hydropower generation potential table s4 the general findings for changing inflows from this study are in agreement with existing literature bush and lemmen 2020 manitoba hydro 2020 stadnyk et al 2019 mk analysis shows that on an annual scale the ensemble mean reservoir inflow increases over time albeit with insufficient 66 agreement on the direction of trend amongst individual climate simulations similarly manitoba hydro 2020 reports that ensemble median streamflow projections for the 2050 s increase by 5 compared to 1981 2010 with no significant 50 60 to weak 61 75 projection agreement albeit using a different generally drier ensemble of cmip5 simulations tefs 2018 notes that ncrb winter discharge increases progressively from 1981 to 2010 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 in this study ensemble mean reservoir inflow also indicates positive trends when separated into three climatic periods 1980 2010 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 not shown the generally low agreement among projected trends for this region is similarly consistent with macdonald et al 2018 results within the nelson and churchill river basins as simulated by the hype model the lack of agreement in mean shift and trend for streamflow and runoff are not unreasonable given the 19 climate simulations were selected to represent the outer extreme of climatic variability across a much larger domain ranging from extremely wet to dry and across a range of warming fig 2 in braun et al 2021 it is also highly likely that the relatively smaller increases in precipitation relative to much warmer temperatures and increasing evapotranspiration across the prairie basins contributes to this lack of agreement due to the already inflow limited nature of prairie basin physiography natural resources canada 2018 regarding the climate ensemble selected for this study relative to the more local projections selected by manitoba hydro manitoba hydro 2020 including drier simulations would only likely increase the disagreement among ensemble members it is only in spring where there is sufficient agreement among the 19 member ensemble to conclude that reservoir inflow and hydropower generation potential are likely to increase in the future it is about as likely as not that the spring reservoir inflow distribution will change over time indicating that while there is an increasing year to year trend from 1981 to 2070 the distribution of year to year reservoir inflow projected by the majority of individual climate simulations does not increase with statistical significance this means operating conditions and the ratio of high to low flow events or relative occurrence of these events are not projected to change year to year spring hydropower generation potential increase both within the ensemble and for individual climate simulations compared to the historical threshold table 7 it is noted that although the number of climate simulations is likely to exceed the historical threshold increases over time such simulations are less than 60 11 out of 19 of the examined simulations simulation agreement in trend shift shown in this study does not represent the probability of any given climate simulation occurring but indicates the probability of model projections having a trend within the ensemble sample beven 2011 the lack of a significant shift or trend detected among the ensemble mean for variables of interest suggests the importance of analyzing future climatic and hydrologic variability had this study reported only mean shifts and trends the conclusion would be that there are likely no significant changes in system hydrology in fact we find there are statistically significant changes projected however with significant disagreement among individual ensemble members this may be an artefact of the in accuracy of climate model projections or this could represent a shift toward more climate and hydrologic extremes in future periods for this system regardless it remains important to consider operations under such future extremes and variability given they are all equally as probable with some scenarios perhaps necessitating significant changes to system operation to maintain generation efficiency 4 2 implications of projected changes and uncertainty on operations statistical analyses in section 3 2 indicate low climate simulation agreement high uncertainty in reservoir inflow and generation potential for the lnrb the uncertainty analysis section 3 3 demonstrates the main source of uncertainty in reservoir inflow and hydropower generation potential comes from climate scenario selection rather than hydrologic model selection bohrn 2012 investigated model uncertainty using three hydrologic models in the upstream portion of the churchill river basin showing that the flow volume uncertainty stemming from model choice was greatest during the open water period lower flow period and was driven by the difference in evaporation computation between the models bohrn 2012 the low agreement among climate driven scenarios in this study makes operational guidance based on ensemble signal difficult to derive consideration of the extreme cases can instead offer guidance on possible system and seasonal vulnerabilities lake winnipeg regulation lwr and churchill river diversion crd operate to meet the seasonal power demand and to mitigate flooding in lake winnipeg and along the lower nelson river winter is arguably an important operating season historically requiring the highest system demand in manitoba for heating and lighting during the cold season where daylight hours are limited due to the higher latitude of the province of manitoba winter lwr and crd outflows are increased by drawing down lake winnipeg and southern indian lake and outflows are reduced in spring to avoid overloading the system when power demand is reduced as days get longer and temperatures warm using the spring freshet to refill the reservoirs maximum outflow may be continued in summer via spilling should inflows be high in a particular year to avoid flooding within the system manitoba hydro 2015 in this study there is an insufficient model agreement in both the trend and shift in reservoir inflow and hydropower generation potential to conclude a specific direction of change we find that winter system robustness remains constant into the future although the year to year magnitude of hydropower generation potential decreases however winter is anticipated to experience the greatest decrease 35 and 37 in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 respectively and least amount of increase 15 and 26 in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 respectively in reservoir inflow and generation potential among the 30 year seasonal means this indicates that although system robustness from the 19 member ensemble is maintained the winter season is the most vulnerable to extreme dry scenarios under historic infrastructure and operations including ice stabilization and freeze up programs under warming temperatures ice restriction at the outlet of lake winnipeg may be less severe which may improve manitoba hydro s capacity to leverage lake winnipeg storage to offset any reduction in winter system inflow regardless it will be important to consider drier climatic scenarios for this basin going forward more in line with the 5 to 2 changes in mean annual precipitation reported as possible by manitoba hydro 2020 though outflows are historically reduced in spring as mentioned above maximum outflow may be continued into summer via spilling should inflows be high to avoid flooding within the system manitoba hydro 2015 although the year to year reservoir inflow volume distribution is about as likely as not to change over time when considering extreme scenarios spring and summer are expected to see the least reduction 22 in both 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 and greatest increase 40 and 60 in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 respectively in 30 year mean reservoir inflow volume respectively projected increases in spring and summer inflow in the future points to a possible reduction in system efficiency particularly in terms of capacity to retain increased flow volumes with limited reservoir capacity to avoid flooding along with lower nelson river under historic operations and infrastructure furthermore the projected increase in spring and summer hydropower generation potential may not be needed as electrical demand lowers in the spring as compared to winter particularly under warming climates it is possible however that summer power demand may increase with increasing temperatures and demand for air conditioning in future periods comparison of percent change in reservoir inflow and hydropower generation potential 30 year mean indicates that historical operation and infrastructure does not currently take full advantage of potentially increasing inflow within the lnrb as expected from a ror system projected trends for 30 year mean hydropower generation potential correlate to general trends in reservoir inflow while a decrease in reservoir inflow results in a proportional decrease in generation potential table 7 an increase in inflow does not necessarily yield a proportional increase in generation potential under modeled historical operations and infrastructure at a certain threshold flow rate qo the rate of increase slope of the regression in hydropower generation with increasing inflow declines and plateaus indicating that generation is at maximum capacity based on the design of the powerhouse and that any additional inflow will not contribute to increased hydropower generation potential and may in fact decline generation potential due to higher tailwater levels fig 6 this limiting threshold of increasing hydropower generation potential contributes to a decrease in the ensemble mean hydropower generation potential as a decrease in inflow is still directly proportional to a decrease in the hydropower generation potential for this system 4 3 study limitations although this study demonstrates potential changes to hydropower generation potential in response to climate change some simplifying assumptions were made first this study leveraged two previous studies by stadnyk et al 2019 and tefs 2018 by using an available 19 member ensemble of climate simulations selected from cmip5 the climate ensemble represents the variability in flow signatures across the hudson bay drainage basin which encompasses the lnrb but does not specifically represent the lnrb analysis using newly released cmip6 simulations eyring et al 2016 or using a different ensemble of climate simulations selected specifically to represent future climatic variability across the nelson river basin should be considered spatial analyses conducted by sobie et al 2021 across canada show a close agreement between cmip5 and cmip6 across our region of interest i e 0 10 anomaly for western hudson bay north of lake winnipeg within the province of manitoba although larger anomalies were reported for temperature and precipitation by the end of the twenty first century the future climate analysis of our study ends in 2070 and does not project up to 2100 therefore we believe that the use of cmip5 is not a hinderance to the overall findings of our study a recent report produced by manitoba hydro 2020 indicates the baysys ensemble is likely about 2 c warmer but equally as wet on an average annual basis as an ensemble of future climate scenarios representing just the nelson river basin the baysys ensemble however did not include the driest scenarios projected for the nelson river basin ranging from 5 to 2 change in mean annual precipitation future efforts should examine projected hydropower generation potential under these drier climatic scenarios second this study assumes stationary historical reservoir operations and infrastructure from the 1981 2070 period to assess the impact of climate change on the lnr generating complex this assumption excludes the newly constructed keeyask gs that commenced operations in early 2021 and a new 500 kv transmission line to the united states that came into service in 2020 this was intentional due to a lack of operations data available for model calibration under the revised system configuration the assumption of stationary operations also excludes the impact of climate change on river ice hydraulics and the river ice stabilization program run by manitoba hydro from this study lees et al 2021 the configuration of modsim used in this study was established to compute potential power generation generating maximum power output regardless of system demand modsim requires power generation targets to optimize to meet the given generation targets and redirects the remaining flow down through the spillway a projection of future power demand and generating station priority ranking were out of the scope of this study 5 conclusions two basin scale hydrologic operations dynamically coupled models watflood modsim and hec hms modsim were run under 19 climate simulations to identify if there are detectable statistically significant changes in the reservoir supply and hydropower generation potential for the lnr complex the following key findings are noted 1 there is a disparity between high simulation agreement on climatic variables and low agreement on reservoir inflow and consequently hydropower generation potential 2 although there are statistically significant trends and shifts in reservoir inflow and hydropower generation potential detectable within the 19 climate simulations there is insufficient agreement and a lack of statistical significance on the direction of trend and mean ensemble change 3 there is limited 6 uncertainty contributed from hydrologic model selection relative to variations due to the climate simulation in part related to the location and function of the study basin i e being an outlet basin despite the lack of climate simulation agreement extreme climate simulations e g ialr81 and mr3r41 indicate divergent futures with wet projections become wetter and dry become drier over time winter a historically high hydropower demand season is projected to be the most vulnerable under the extreme dry scenario showing the greatest percent reduction 35 and 37 in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 respectively and the least percent increase 15 and 26 in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 respectively in reservoir inflow and therefore hydropower generation potential this is potentially problematic when considering the need to meet future electricity demands however warmer temperatures could offset increasing winter demand in the future to examine such effects coupled socioeconomic and hydrologic modeling scenarios are required and recommended as future work in spring the historical flood season we find the least percent reduction 22 and 22 in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 respectively and highest percent increases 23 and 33 in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 respectively in reservoir inflow increasing the potential for spilling to manage higher system inflow it is noted that under modeled operations and infrastructure the lnrb river reservoir system does not fully utilize the projected increase in reservoir inflow after a certain threshold capacity limiting the increase in 30 year mean generation potential this could be potentially offset by changes in future system operations in response to changing hydrologic conditions which again can only be explored through more sophisticated coupled models that account for human decision making however if flows consistently increase and the basin becomes wetter it is likely that modifications to the production system i e generation capacity will be needed to leverage additional inflow for efficient hydropower generation this study indicates that the historical operation and infrastructure within the lnrb may be vulnerable under extreme climates and that further research incorporating the newest infrastructure keeyask and projected power demand is required to plan for new operational guidelines credit authorship contribution statement sj kim methodology development of software validation

7961,study region lower nelson river basin manitoba canada study focus hydroelectricity makes up almost 97 of electricity generated in manitoba of which over 70 of its generation capacity is installed along the lower nelson river lnr in this study 19 climate projections representing 87 of climatic variability over hudson bay drainage basin are applied to coupled hydrologic operations models to estimate water supply and hydropower generation potential changes under future climates new hydrological insights for the region future inflow to the forebay of the main hydropower generating stations along lnr is expected to increase in spring and summer but decrease in winter and fall consequently hydropower generation potential is projected to increase for spring the historical flood season which may lead to reduced reservoir inflow retention efficiency in extremely dry climatic simulations winter seasons see a reduction in reservoir inflow and hydropower generation potential up to 35 and 37 in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 respectively projected changes in reservoir inflow and hydropower generation potential continue to diverge over time with dry scenarios becoming drier and wet becoming wetter yielding high basin climate sensitivity and uncertainty with system supply and generation potential despite the presence of statistically significant individual trends and changes there is a low agreement within the climate ensemble analysis of system robustness shows adjustment of the operations along lnr should be considered over time to better leverage changing seasonal

hydropower generation depends on reliable water supply adapting to changing climate and meeting energy demand are common challenges for hydropower operations globally liu et al 2020 from 1984 2016

located bush and lemmen 2020 according to the high emission representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 the canadian prairies could expect an increase in annual mean temperature of up to 2 3 c and 6

temperature in 2040 2068 compared to 1981 2010 period with a strong agreement in the direction of projected change amongst the future climate scenarios manitoba hydro 2020 the increase in mean annual

governing the snowmelt freshet despite the moderate to high model agreement for increasing mean annual temperature and precipitation across the ncrb manitoba hydro 2020 the integrated effects on streamflow are complex debeer et al 2016 leading to significantly lower model agreement in the projected direction and amount of runoff and streamflow discharge in particular the hudson bay complex where lnrb is located is a highly climate sensitive region with a low streamflow projection agreement macdonald et al 2018 which warrants an investigation on the effects of climate change on hydropower operations in lnrb studies that examine the impact of climate change on hydropower systems have largely been focused on analyzing flow ensembles using stand alone hydrologic models with climate forcing generated from one or more global climate models gcms greenhouse gas emissions scenarios ghges and downscaling methods dsms the evaluation of the associated impact on hydropower system has been mostly limited to focusing on basins with single or multiple parallel reservoir operations using operations models or optimization algorithms chhuon et al 2016 eum and simonovic 2010 lanini et al 2014 park and kim 2014 or on complex basins with simplified equations to represent reservoir operations carvajal et al 2017 patro et al 2018 or one way coupling of hydrologic and operations or optimization model simulating system based on given boundary flow condition ahn et al 2016 minville et al 2009 there are few studies that examine a cascaded hydropower system with dynamic feedback between hydrologic and operations models i e updating system operations and forebay storage based on timeseries inflows or a study on the effects of climate change on hydropower operations though some studies have examined global to regional to local scale impacts of climate hydrology and hydropower operations anghileri et al 2018 hamududu and killingtveit 2016 timalsina et al 2015 dynamic coupling between the hydrologic and systems operations models remains elusive despite recommendations for research to proceed in this direction schaefli 2015 and even fewer have focused directly on northern manitoba in this study the projected 2021 2070 trends and changes in reservoir inflow and power generation potential of the lnrb under 19 cmip5 simulations are compared to 1981 2010 results under historical 1981 2010 system settings and operations reservoir inflow and power generation were simulated using two coupled hydrologic operations models watflood modsim and hec hms modsim which simulate basin water balance and system operations using different structural arrangements facilitating model uncertainty analyses in particular this study seeks to answer following research questions 1 will changes in future reservoir supply and hydropower generation potential be statistically significant with high confidence for the lnrb 2 what are the implications of projected changes and uncertainty on future system operations this study is one of the recent hydrologic operations model coupling initiatives designed to identify shortages and or surplus in water supply and power generation potential of the lnrb system originating within the global water futures integrated modelling programme for canada program global water futures 2021 changes are analyzed for individual climate projections and for the ensemble of projections to demonstrate the confidence i e agreement and amount of evidence in projected trends and changes as per the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc directives ipcc 2014 the identified shortages or surplus will help inform mid term operation system planning and optimization 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area the lnrb fig 1 covers 90 500 km2 of land and surface water area and is an outlet basin of the larger nelson churchill river basin 1 4 million km2 draining the canadian rockies across the prairies parts of north central united states and parts of north western ontario into the hudson bay the majority of the lnrb lies in the canadian shield underlain by shallow or exposed bedrock the basin is located in a sporadic permafrost region 10 50 permafrost with the most downstream portion in extensive discontinuous permafrost 50 90 smith et al 2015 the lnrb is characterized by a low topographic gradient with an average basin slope of 0 037 due to lake agassiz glaciation surface depressions such as small lakes channelized lakes and wetlands are extensive throughout the basin holmes 2016 the lnrb lies in a sub arctic continental climate region characterized by cool summers cold winters and moderate precipitation and humidity holmes 2016 lilhare et al 2019 the basin mean daily temperature varies north south with a mean temperature of 3 7 c in gillam and 0 4 c in cross lake dictating the basin s cold region hydrologic response the snowfall free period i e rain only is short june to september with mean daily air temperature remaining sub zero for the majority of a year november to april environment and climate change canada 2020 the basin receives on average 500 mm of annual precipitation with 69 rainfall and 31 snowfall the highest monthly precipitation occurs in july with approximately 16 of annual precipitation while the lowest monthly precipitation occurs between november and april annual evapotranspiration ranges from approximately 300 mm to 350 mm across the lnrb environment and climate change canada 2020 smith et al 2015 2 2 basin streamflow and regulation there are 12 wsc gauges throughout the basin eight of which account for tributary flow and four gauges along the main channel s the nelson and the burntwood rivers carry water diverted from the churchill river into the lnrb through the rat river and notigi control structure cs and are the major rivers within the basin merging at split lake on average the lnrb flow measured at the long spruce generating station gs which is the nearest water survey of canada wsc gauge to the hudson bay outlet is composed of 57 contribution by the nelson river west channel controlled by the jenpeg gs 10 contribution from the unregulated nelson river east channel and 23 contribution at the notigi cs only a small percentage 10 of the annual flow observed at its outlet is generated within the lnrb water survey of canada 2020 both the nelson and churchill rivers have relatively low regulated seasonal streamflow variability the lnrb is a highly regulated basin with two control structures jenpeg and notigi and six completed hydropower gs wuskwatim jenpeg kelsey kettle long spruce and limestone the first unit of the seventh and the newest hydropower station on the nelson river keeyask gs commenced operations in february 2021 with station completed expected in 2022 a summary of the seven hydropower generating stations within the lnrb is listed in table 1 over 70 of manitoba hydro s total hydropower generation capacity 5228 mw manitoba hydro 2018 is on the lower nelson river and three of manitoba hydro s largest generating stations kettle long spruce and limestone are located near the outlet of the lnrb to hudson bay in this study wuskwatim and limestone gs are considered part of historic operations although both gs came online after 1981 this is a reasonable assumption because the focus of this study is to compare the historic and future hydropower generation potential rather than the produced generation generation potential at keeyask was not considered in this study because the gs is not part of historic 1981 2010 operations and no discharge data were available a unique characteristic of the lnrb hydropower system is that it mostly operates as a cascade run of the river ror system with reservoirs of little storage capacity for this study ror is defined as hydropower stations that do not have immediate control of monthly or larger reservoir storage the major lakes storages affecting lnrb operations are southern indian lake sil and lake winnipeg located upstream of the generating stations their releases at notigi sil and jenpeg lake winnipeg contribute approximately 23 and 67 of the annual flows at the hudson bay outlet respectively release operations work together to optimize downstream flows to major generating stations as there is a multi week time delay between major system storage and the gs manitoba hydro 2015 table 2 2 3 climate data an ensemble of plausible future climate simulations was chosen by braun et al 2021 and has been earlier described by macdonald et al 2018 for the baysys project with the support of manitoba hydro there was interest by manitoba hydro in understanding the impact the baysys projected climate changes could have on generation potential which this study is designed to address the ensemble consists of 19 climate simulations generated from 14 gcms and 2 rcps 4 5 and 8 5 selected from 154 simulations from the cmip5 ensemble through k means clustering for the 2021 2070 period braun et al 2021 clustering and consequently simulation selection were based on changes in annual and seasonal mean temperature and precipitation spatially averaged over the hudson bay drainage basin domain the resulting ensemble represents 87 of the variability in the climate reference period 1981 2010 and the future period 2041 2070 over this domain which includes lnrb the clustering approach reduced the number of climate simulations and thus the computational cost of the analysis while maintaining adequate uncertainty representation of the entire ensemble the selected 19 climate simulations were bias corrected using the quantile mapping approach by mpelasoka and chiew using hydrogfd as a baseline to be consistent with the hydrologic model forcing applied in this study berg et al 2017 mpelasoka and chiew 2009 this bias corrected climate data was provided by the ouranos consortium for more information please refer to braun et al 2021 a detailed list of the ipcc climate model scenarios included in this study as inherited from the baysys project are found in table 1 of braun et al 2021 historically approximately 90 of the annual flow observed at the outlet of the lower nelson river is generated upstream of the lnrb therefore a review of upstream climate conditions is necessary to understand projected changes in water supply and generation potential upstream of the lnrb the climatic condition varies across ncrb annual mean temperature of 1981 2010 across ncrb ranges from 6 5 c northeast to 6 1 c southwest while precipitation ranges from 323 mm in the west to 777 mm in the east manitoba hydro 2020 to summarize the changes in climatic variables for ncrb simulated precipitation temperature evapotranspiration and runoff from h hype work were used to compute a single area weighted mean monthly value to represent ncrb the projected changes in the upstream lnrb climate conditions are analyzed in section 3 1 2 4 models 2 4 1 model coupling three hydrologic models and an operations model were used to simulate the river reservoir system and operations in this study connected via a custom wrapper fig 2 as the lnrb is located downstream of the ncrb a continental scale hydrologic model called hype hydrological predictions for the environment was used to compute the upstream contribution of ncrb coming into jenpeg gs and notigi cs two basin scale hydrologic models watflood and hec hms were used to simulate lnrb hydrology and local inflows for the operations model to estimate hydrologic uncertainty pokorny et al 2021 found that choice of hydrologic model was more influential on uncertainty and hydrologic outcomes than the parameterization of individual models hence why we focus on model structural uncertainty in this study model setups and calibrations in this study were inherited from pokorny et al 2021 where a detailed explanation of model structural and accompanying parameter uncertainty can be found an operations model modsim dss was used to compute reservoir operations and hydropower generation which cannot be computed by hydrologic models the basin scale hydrologic models and the operations model were coupled using a custom coded python wrapper the python wrapper iteratively runs and transfers reservoir inflow and outflow data between the hydrologic and operations models by modifying model input files reservoir inflow and outflow time series are exchanged at three locations within the lnrb kelsey wuskwatim and kettle gs these locations were chosen to 1 represent the churchill and nelson river contributions wuskwatim gs downstream of notigi cs and kelsey gs downstream of jenpeg gs and 2 the influence on downstream stations release from kelsey and wuskwatim gs impacting inflow at kettle gs release from kettle gs governing inflow to limestone and long spruce gs the wrapper terminates the iterative model run when specified reservoir release from the operations model converges see kim 2020 for more information 2 4 2 hydrological models hype is a semi distributed hydrologic model lindström et al 2010 for simulating runoff and water quality simulations with a focus on simulating large scale domains e g europe basins and sub basins are discretized by land use land cover lulc soil type and elevation hype has various sub processes well suited for cold region hydrology such as snow accumulation and melt freezing and thawing of soil and frozen soil infiltration the h hype hudson bay hype configuration used in this study is from the baysys project and was extensively calibrated using the same input forcing as here as described by previous studies stadnyk et al 2020 tefs et al 2021 h hype simulation over the ncrb was calibrated and validated over 1981 2010 simulated 1971 2013 stadnyk et al 2020 with a new reservoir regulation routine developed using 2001 2010 reservoir data for jenpeg gs and notigi cs operations at the daily time step the nse values are 0 77 and 0 09 kge of 0 74 and 0 33 respectively and percent bias values are 1 1 and 0 4 respectively for 1981 2010 tefs et al 2021 though notigi operations show low nse performance it should be noted that this was a significant improvement over previous models e g a hype without reservoir operations that this is a two outlet lake and that it is the timing of operations less so the volume that is problematic in this case tefs et al 2021 hec hms hydrologic modeling system developed by the hydrologic engineering center is a conceptual semi distributed hydrologic model developed by the united states army corps of engineers u s army corps of engineers 2016 it is designed to simulate the precipitation runoff process of dendritic basins in a wide range of geographical locations hec hms has several methods for simulating each hydrological process giving it flexibility in adapting to various basins the hec hms model used in this study simulates forebay operations and therefore considers reservoir forebays as reservoirs table s1 the model did not account for reservoir evaporation nor seepage as losses from forebay as insignificant the model utilized the elevation storage discharge curve method to simulate reservoir operations version 4 2 1 the hec hms configuration with the best basin average kge performance over 1981 2010 for the entire lnrb was selected from behavioral models pokorny et al 2021 the average kge nse values are 0 68 0 46 for 12 wsc gauges and 0 87 0 82 for mh regulated reservoirs for the period of 1981 2010 watflood is a physically based distributed hydrologic model kouwen 2020 with a focus on utilizing remotely sensed land cover data dems and numerical weather data for simulating the hydrological processes across the lnrb watflood with the 0 167 longitude x 0 1 latitude 11 km by 11 km at the centroid of the lnrb grid cell size was used the waflood model considered lakes and reservoirs by grids identified as water from land cover data and therefore considered both the reservoir forebay and the lake feeding the forebay as a single reservoir the watflood model computed open water evaporation the model utilized user defined polynomial or power function to simulate reservoir operations watflood used the grouped response units grus approach where the runoff response was calculated from each hydrologically significant group in each grid and routed downstream similar to hec hms the waflood configuration with the best basin average kge performance over 1981 2010 for the entire lnrb behavioral models pokorny et al 2021 the average kge nse values are 0 77 0 65 for 12 wsc gauges and 0 88 0 83 for mh regulated reservoirs 2 4 3 operations model modsim dss hereafter modsim is a water resources operation model developed at the colorado state university labadie 2006 modsim is capable of simulating complex surface water network systems and water allocation according to water demands and rights and governmental regulations using the network flow optimization algorithm the river reservoir system is represented as a network of nodes e g demand channel junctions reservoirs sink and links e g rivers and channels given a water supply system and user specified constraints modsim has an internal optimization operator to allocate water by satisfying physical and operational constraints a unique feature of modsim is the ability for users to customize any knowledge based operating policies or rule curves through user supplemented code in c net or vb net language using custom code editor unlike the hydrologic models modsim cannot simulate the rainfall runoff process and thus all tributary flows must be provided as input forcing from the hydrologic model therefore the modsim configuration represents only the river reservoir system along the main stem of the lower nelson river an existing operational model configuration version 8 5 0 was used beiraghdar 2019 the average nse values are 0 89 for natural lakes and 0 78 for mh regulated reservoirs 2 5 analysis conventions the simulation period was divided into three 30 year periods for inter period comparisons to identify changes in reservoir supply and hydropower generation potential historical baseline 1981 2010 near future 2021 2050 and mid future 2041 2070 changes in reservoir supply and hydropower generation potential are compared independent of model bias as the same bias exists in climate ensemble forced simulations normalized anomaly is calculated by eq 1 where x is the temporal mean in interest monthly seasonal or annual μ is the long term mean and σ is standard deviation for seasonal analysis months were categorized into spring mam summer jja fall son and winter djf following previous hype and hudson bay domain studies macdonald et al 2018 tefs 2018 1 normali zed anomaly x μ σ trends and changes in reservoir inflow were analyzed for three gss within the manitoba hydro system kelsey on nelson river wuskwatim on burntwood river and kettle that receives combined flow as each reservoir represents the respective inflow supply of the major rivers the projected reservoir inflows were examined both as an ensemble using ensemble mean values as well as individual climate simulation to discern model confidence or the degree of the climate simulation agreement among the 19 ensemble members likelihood terminology mastrandrea et al 2011 was used where virtually certain 99 very likely 90 likely 66 about as likely as not 33 66 and unlikely 33 simulation agreement the trends and changes in hydropower generation potential were analyzed for the three largest gs s kettle limestone and long spruce gs 2 6 statistical and robustness analyses two non parametric statistical tests were conducted to identify trends and changes in the distribution of reservoir inflow and hydropower generation potential the mann kendall mk statistical test kendall 1975 mann 1945 identified the existence and direction of statistically significant trends the computed magnitude and direction of the linear time series trends were derived using sen s slopes sen 1968 a nonparametric method yielding confidence intervals 95 confidence for slope of the trend line the mann whitney wilcoxon u mww test mann and whitney 1947 identified statistically significant changes in annual and seasonal inflow volume distributions between the 30 year periods statistical analyses required that data were serially independent however hydrological time series at commonly exhibit serial correlation yue et al 2002 to limit the influence of serial correlation trend free pre whitening tfpw and pre whitening techniques were applied to annual time series prior to statistical testing von storch 1995 yue et al 2002 no pre whitening technique was applied for seasonal time series i e annual series of seasonal values as seasonal inflow and hydropower generation potential distribution were assumed to be independent both mk and mww tests were one sided with 5 significance 95 confidence interval in assessing future system performance where no single performance projection is representative performance metrics must account for the probability of system performance amongst plausible projections robustness defined as insensitivity of system performance to various conditions maier et al 2016 mcphail et

historical annual and seasonal ensemble median hydropower generation potential establishing a threshold to quantify whether the current lnrb system was able to generate similar amounts of hydropower

into the lnrb and to better understand the driving factors for changing reservoir inflow and hydropower generation potential along lower nelson river 3 1 1 air temperature ensemble mean annual basin temperature is projected to increase by 1 5 c and 3 2 c in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 respectively mean seasonal and monthly temperatures are likely to virtually certain to increase for all seasons table 3 warming is most pronounced during colder months winter and spring fig s1a relative to warmer months similar to previously reported findings vincent et al 2018 2012 the 30 year ensemble mean winter temperature increases the most i e 1 7 c and 4 1 c in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 respectively and the 30 year ensemble mean summer and fall temperatures increase the least 1 2 c and 2 7 c and 1 1 c and 2 6 c in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 respectively most extreme increases in 30 year mean temperatures are projected to occur in spring 3 8 c and 8 4 c in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 respectively 3 1 2 precipitation projected ensemble mean annual precipitation is very likely to increase by 4 and 12 in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 respectively fig s2 which agrees with projected increases in annual precipitation across the prairies bush and lemmen 2020 manitoba hydro 2020 spring shows the greatest increase both in terms of the anomaly and percent change in precipitation relative to the 1981 2010 ensemble mean table 4 fig s2 mean summer precipitation in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 are about as likely as not to increase resulting from low ensemble agreement fig s3 which has been previously reported for the ncrb and lower latitude regions of canada bush and lemmen 2020 manitoba hydro 2020 stadnyk et al 2019 3 1 3 evapotranspiration evapotranspiration is projected to increase year round into the future with ensemble mean annual evapotranspiration increasing by 6 and 12 in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 respectively table 4 fig s2 similar to precipitation spring evapotranspiration shows the greatest increases but also the greatest uncertainty fig s3 3 1 4 runoff runoff is non linearly related to precipitation and temperature and the corresponding high simulation agreement for annual increases in both precipitation and evapotranspiration result in low agreement on the direction of change in ncrb runoff that flows into the lnrb the percent increase in precipitation and evapotranspiration are comparable fig 3 but the rate of the normalized anomaly is higher for evapotranspiration compared to precipitation due to the higher spread standard deviation in the mean annual precipitation within the ensemble fig s2 intuitively although ensemble mean annual runoff increases over time it does so at a much slower rate of increase because increases in precipitation and evapotranspiration balance one another table 4 shows the ncrb is about as likely as not to experience a slightly drier 3 and slightly wetter 2 period in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 respectively compared to the historic baseline the mean monthly runoff is predicted about as likely as not or likely to decrease in the open water season may sept the greatest percent increase in runoff is projected for winter compared to 1981 2010 table 4 fig s3 the large percent increase is due to the magnitude of change is of a similar magnitude of historic runoff the greatest magnitude of seasonal runoff anomaly occurs in spring the average magnitude of winter runoff anomaly 0 3 km3 and 0 8 km3 is only a fraction of spring runoff anomaly 0 6 km3 and 2 0 km3 3 2 projected changes in reservoir inflow and hydropower generation 3 2 1 projected trends in reservoir inflow and power generation potential examining the ensemble mean annual and seasonal inflow volumes not shown the reservoir inflow to kelsey nelson river wuskwatim burntwood river and kettle combined gs show statistically significant increasing trends in annual spring and summer inflows but a statistically significant decreasing trend in fall inflows winter inflow shows a statistically insignificant decreasing trend table s2 and consequently the ensemble mean hydropower generation potential shows a decreasing trend in winter and fall seasons across the lnrb table s3 it was found that spring inflows to wuskwatim and kettle gs are likely to increase when accounting for statistical significance table 5 however other seasonal inflows to all the three gss are about as likely as not to show increasing or decreasing trends similarly the spring hydropower generation potential of the three largest gss kettle limestone and long spruce gs along lnr is likely to show increasing trends while other seasonal hydropower generation potentials are about as likely as not to show increasing or decreasing trends the similar trends between reservoir inflow and hydropower generation potential are not surprising as hydropower generation along the nelson river is operated as ror with relatively insignificant storage capacities while statistically significant trends are detected overall there is insufficient 66 simulation agreement as an ensemble to determine a conclusive direction of the trend this in itself is an important finding for hydropower operators who will likely need to operate the system under considerable uncertainty in the future 3 2 2 projected shift in reservoir inflow and hydropower generation potential the distribution or probability density function of ensemble mean inflow volume at kettle gs is expected to decrease in winter and fall but to increase in summer and spring both in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 relative to the 1981 2010 baseline indicated by blue fill for statistically significant shifts table 6 however as with the mk analysis table 5 examination of individual climate simulation agreement suggests low agreement on the existence and direction of a statistically significant shift in the distribution of inflow volume amongst the 19 member ensemble it is about as likely as not or unlikely to see statistically significant changes in the distributions of mean annual or seasonal reservoir inflow volumes between the three 30 year periods table 6 fig s4 particularly in winter djf there is little change in the median inflow but significant uncertainty in moving from the historic to future periods indicative of a larger operating range conversely in spring mam fall son there is increasing variability however also statistically significant increases decreases in mean inflow fig s4 table 6 summer jja results in a significant increase in seasonal inflow variability as well as both increasing and decreasing mean inflows again pointing to more challenging future operating regimes the low agreement among inflow projections in response to relatively consistent climate projections points to a highly sensitive to climatic change basin water supply the lack of agreement in the projected change to the distribution of inflow volume is an artefact of insufficient 66 ensemble agreement rather than insignificant changes projected by the climate simulations an inter period comparison of the distributions of reservoir inflow for mr3r41 statistically significant wetter future ialr81 statistically significant drier future and the ensemble are shown on fig 4 each of the 19 simulations driven by members of the climate ensemble starts near the historic ensemble mean 1981 2010 and shifts toward either lower or higher inflow over time as a result the ensemble distribution spread increases further into the future overall there are higher increases in the volume of inflow projected under wetter simulations relative to smaller decreases in inflow volume by drier scenarios contributing to an overall insignificant increasing trend for the ensemble mean shifts in hydropower generation potential were examined by 1 comparing the percentage of years in the ensemble and 2 the number of individual simulations which likely exceed the historical 30 year ensemble annual or seasonal median hydropower generation potential threshold value on an annual basis the overall number of years within the 19 member ensemble exceeding the historical threshold during the 2021 2050 period decreases compared to the 1981 2010 and 2041 2070 periods winter and summer hydropower generation potential exceedance rates decrease in 2021 2050 but then increase in 2041 2070 while spring and fall exceedance rates continue to increase and decrease respectively over time examination of the likelihood of any individual ensemble member exceeding the threshold value indicates the detected shift in percent of years for the ensemble originates from specific climate scenarios rather than from an ensemble trend the number of simulations likely to exceed the historical threshold is projected to remain the same table 7 except for spring although the magnitude of year to year hydropower generation potential reduces relative to the 1981 2010 baseline the reduction in year to year exceedance originates from individual climate simulations increasing hydropower generation potential is projected in spring both as an ensemble and from individual simulations table 7 indicating that increasing hydropower generation potential occurs both across multiple simulations and within individual simulations polarization towards drier or wetter futures is also observed when analyzing annual and seasonal 30 year means of reservoir inflow and hydropower generation potential flow simulations derived from dry scenarios ialr81 micr81 and mier81 shift to lower reservoir inflow over time whereas wetter projections inrr41 mr3r41 and mr3r81 result in increasing reservoir inflow in general however agreement on the direction of change for the 30 year mean reservoir inflow is evenly split except for spring and fall seasons where more simulations agreed in an increase and decrease respectively polarization and general equal split between increasing and decreasing inflow volume changes cancel each other out within the ensemble leading to a lower magnitude of change 10 compared to changes among individual climate simulations table 8 percent changes detected for annual and seasonal mean inflow and hydropower generation potential follow similar patterns as indicated for kettle gs table 9 the highest reduction in the ensemble mean seasonal potential occurs in fall 7 and the highest reduction under an individual climate simulation occurs in winter 35 spring and summer ensemble mean hydropower generation potentials are increasing through time 3 3 uncertainty due to the hydrologic model selection the two hydrologic models chosen in this study were strategically selected because they are of differing structural configurations and hence process representation watflood is a discretized distributed and physically based model while the hec hms configuration make it a lumped conceptual model with opposing structural and process representation configurations it is possible to examine hydrologic uncertainty within the lower nelson river stemming from model choice impacting both runoff inflow and hydropower generation potential the annual and seasonal mean percent differences in reservoir inflow and hydropower generation potential resulting from choice of hydrologic model is less than 6 table 9 both models result in the identification of similar trend results both annually and seasonally tables s2 s3 it should be noted that the relatively small magnitude of hydrologic model structural uncertainty is influenced here by basin selection with both watflood and hec hms models run using the same upstream boundary inflow generated by hype the lnrb is an outlet sub basin of ncrb and historically approximately 90 of lnrb outflow is generated upstream therefore the uncertainty introduced by model choice for the lnrb is likely lower than if the study had considered a headwater basin with no upstream inflow forcing watflood simulates higher reservoir inflow in winter and spring and lower inflow for summer and fall periods relative to hec hms table 9 on an annual scale the two models exhibit similar reservoir inflow volume response with the most significant differences in inflow occur in summer during the historic period 1981 2010 the oscillating seasonal difference between ice on and ice off season table 9 is mainly due to the differences in structural configuration between these two models and how they represent lakes and evaporation losses watflood simulates a greater reservoir extent and therefore higher losses through reservoir evaporation watflood also considers the entire water body the reservoir forebay and the lake feeding the forebay as a reservoir and computes open water evaporation for the entire water body watflood computes open water evaporation only when there is no snow cover kouwen and stadnyk 2017 in contrast the current hec hms model setup for the lnrb does not account for open water evaporation in its reservoir computation in addition to only considering the forebay as the reservoir representing only 1 4 of the actual lake area table 2 watflood therefore computes higher water loss through evaporation which is internally subtracted from upstream inflows into the reservoir and which leads to a reduced reservoir inflow volume during the summer and fall periods historically the snow free period in the lnrb is relatively short generally occurring between may and october environment and climate change canada 2019 and there are significantly more sunlight hours in summer than winter due to the lnrb s high latitude watflood under estimates reservoir inflow during the snow free period jja and son fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 projected change and agreement in inflow and power generation potential statistical analyses of annual and seasonal reservoir inflow and hydropower generation potential indicate that while there are statistically significant shifts and trends among the 19 member ensemble there is insufficient agreement to achieve statistical significance or a likely direction of trend for reservoir supply and resulting hydropower generation potential table s4 the general findings for changing inflows from this study are in agreement with existing literature bush and lemmen 2020 manitoba hydro 2020 stadnyk et al 2019 mk analysis shows that on an annual scale the ensemble mean reservoir inflow increases over time albeit with insufficient 66 agreement on the direction of trend amongst individual climate simulations similarly manitoba hydro 2020 reports that ensemble median streamflow projections for the 2050 s increase by 5 compared to 1981 2010 with no significant 50 60 to weak 61 75 projection agreement albeit using a different generally drier ensemble of cmip5 simulations tefs 2018 notes that ncrb winter discharge increases progressively from 1981 to 2010 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 in this study ensemble mean reservoir inflow also indicates positive trends when separated into three climatic periods 1980 2010 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 not shown the generally low agreement among projected trends for this region is similarly consistent with macdonald et al 2018 results within the nelson and churchill river basins as simulated by the hype model the lack of agreement in mean shift and trend for streamflow and runoff are not unreasonable given the 19 climate simulations were selected to represent the outer extreme of climatic variability across a much larger domain ranging from extremely wet to dry and across a range of warming fig 2 in braun et al 2021 it is also highly likely that the relatively smaller increases in precipitation relative to much warmer temperatures and increasing evapotranspiration across the prairie basins contributes to this lack of agreement due to the already inflow limited nature of prairie basin physiography natural resources canada 2018 regarding the climate ensemble selected for this study relative to the more local projections selected by manitoba hydro manitoba hydro 2020 including drier simulations would only likely increase the disagreement among ensemble members it is only in spring where there is sufficient agreement among the 19 member ensemble to conclude that reservoir inflow and hydropower generation potential are likely to increase in the future it is about as likely as not that the spring reservoir inflow distribution will change over time indicating that while there is an increasing year to year trend from 1981 to 2070 the distribution of year to year reservoir inflow projected by the majority of individual climate simulations does not increase with statistical significance this means operating conditions and the ratio of high to low flow events or relative occurrence of these events are not projected to change year to year spring hydropower generation potential increase both within the ensemble and for individual climate simulations compared to the historical threshold table 7 it is noted that although the number of climate simulations is likely to exceed the historical threshold increases over time such simulations are less than 60 11 out of 19 of the examined simulations simulation agreement in trend shift shown in this study does not represent the probability of any given climate simulation occurring but indicates the probability of model projections having a trend within the ensemble sample beven 2011 the lack of a significant shift or trend detected among the ensemble mean for variables of interest suggests the importance of analyzing future climatic and hydrologic variability had this study reported only mean shifts and trends the conclusion would be that there are likely no significant changes in system hydrology in fact we find there are statistically significant changes projected however with significant disagreement among individual ensemble members this may be an artefact of the in accuracy of climate model projections or this could represent a shift toward more climate and hydrologic extremes in future periods for this system regardless it remains important to consider operations under such future extremes and variability given they are all equally as probable with some scenarios perhaps necessitating significant changes to system operation to maintain generation efficiency 4 2 implications of projected changes and uncertainty on operations statistical analyses in section 3 2 indicate low climate simulation agreement high uncertainty in reservoir inflow and generation potential for the lnrb the uncertainty analysis section 3 3 demonstrates the main source of uncertainty in reservoir inflow and hydropower generation potential comes from climate scenario selection rather than hydrologic model selection bohrn 2012 investigated model uncertainty using three hydrologic models in the upstream portion of the churchill river basin showing that the flow volume uncertainty stemming from model choice was greatest during the open water period lower flow period and was driven by the difference in evaporation computation between the models bohrn 2012 the low agreement among climate driven scenarios in this study makes operational guidance based on ensemble signal difficult to derive consideration of the extreme cases can instead offer guidance on possible system and seasonal vulnerabilities lake winnipeg regulation lwr and churchill river diversion crd operate to meet the seasonal power demand and to mitigate flooding in lake winnipeg and along the lower nelson river winter is arguably an important operating season historically requiring the highest system demand in manitoba for heating and lighting during the cold season where daylight hours are limited due to the higher latitude of the province of manitoba winter lwr and crd outflows are increased by drawing down lake winnipeg and southern indian lake and outflows are reduced in spring to avoid overloading the system when power demand is reduced as days get longer and temperatures warm using the spring freshet to refill the reservoirs maximum outflow may be continued in summer via spilling should inflows be high in a particular year to avoid flooding within the system manitoba hydro 2015 in this study there is an insufficient model agreement in both the trend and shift in reservoir inflow and hydropower generation potential to conclude a specific direction of change we find that winter system robustness remains constant into the future although the year to year magnitude of hydropower generation potential decreases however winter is anticipated to experience the greatest decrease 35 and 37 in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 respectively and least amount of increase 15 and 26 in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 respectively in reservoir inflow and generation potential among the 30 year seasonal means this indicates that although system robustness from the 19 member ensemble is maintained the winter season is the most vulnerable to extreme dry scenarios under historic infrastructure and operations including ice stabilization and freeze up programs under warming temperatures ice restriction at the outlet of lake winnipeg may be less severe which may improve manitoba hydro s capacity to leverage lake winnipeg storage to offset any reduction in winter system inflow regardless it will be important to consider drier climatic scenarios for this basin going forward more in line with the 5 to 2 changes in mean annual precipitation reported as possible by manitoba hydro 2020 though outflows are historically reduced in spring as mentioned above maximum outflow may be continued into summer via spilling should inflows be high to avoid flooding within the system manitoba hydro 2015 although the year to year reservoir inflow volume distribution is about as likely as not to change over time when considering extreme scenarios spring and summer are expected to see the least reduction 22 in both 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 and greatest increase 40 and 60 in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 respectively in 30 year mean reservoir inflow volume respectively projected increases in spring and summer inflow in the future points to a possible reduction in system efficiency particularly in terms of capacity to retain increased flow volumes with limited reservoir capacity to avoid flooding along with lower nelson river under historic operations and infrastructure furthermore the projected increase in spring and summer hydropower generation potential may not be needed as electrical demand lowers in the spring as compared to winter particularly under warming climates it is possible however that summer power demand may increase with increasing temperatures and demand for air conditioning in future periods comparison of percent change in reservoir inflow and hydropower generation potential 30 year mean indicates that historical operation and infrastructure does not currently take full advantage of potentially increasing inflow within the lnrb as expected from a ror system projected trends for 30 year mean hydropower generation potential correlate to general trends in reservoir inflow while a decrease in reservoir inflow results in a proportional decrease in generation potential table 7 an increase in inflow does not necessarily yield a proportional increase in generation potential under modeled historical operations and infrastructure at a certain threshold flow rate qo the rate of increase slope of the regression in hydropower generation with increasing inflow declines and plateaus indicating that generation is at maximum capacity based on the design of the powerhouse and that any additional inflow will not contribute to increased hydropower generation potential and may in fact decline generation potential due to higher tailwater levels fig 6 this limiting threshold of increasing hydropower generation potential contributes to a decrease in the ensemble mean hydropower generation potential as a decrease in inflow is still directly proportional to a decrease in the hydropower generation potential for this system 4 3 study limitations although this study demonstrates potential changes to hydropower generation potential in response to climate change some simplifying assumptions were made first this study leveraged two previous studies by stadnyk et al 2019 and tefs 2018 by using an available 19 member ensemble of climate simulations selected from cmip5 the climate ensemble represents the variability in flow signatures across the hudson bay drainage basin which encompasses the lnrb but does not specifically represent the lnrb analysis using newly released cmip6 simulations eyring et al 2016 or using a different ensemble of climate simulations selected specifically to represent future climatic variability across the nelson river basin should be considered spatial analyses conducted by sobie et al 2021 across canada show a close agreement between cmip5 and cmip6 across our region of interest i e 0 10 anomaly for western hudson bay north of lake winnipeg within the province of manitoba although larger anomalies were reported for temperature and precipitation by the end of the twenty first century the future climate analysis of our study ends in 2070 and does not project up to 2100 therefore we believe that the use of cmip5 is not a hinderance to the overall findings of our study a recent report produced by manitoba hydro 2020 indicates the baysys ensemble is likely about 2 c warmer but equally as wet on an average annual basis as an ensemble of future climate scenarios representing just the nelson river basin the baysys ensemble however did not include the driest scenarios projected for the nelson river basin ranging from 5 to 2 change in mean annual precipitation future efforts should examine projected hydropower generation potential under these drier climatic scenarios second this study assumes stationary historical reservoir operations and infrastructure from the 1981 2070 period to assess the impact of climate change on the lnr generating complex this assumption excludes the newly constructed keeyask gs that commenced operations in early 2021 and a new 500 kv transmission line to the united states that came into service in 2020 this was intentional due to a lack of operations data available for model calibration under the revised system configuration the assumption of stationary operations also excludes the impact of climate change on river ice hydraulics and the river ice stabilization program run by manitoba hydro from this study lees et al 2021 the configuration of modsim used in this study was established to compute potential power generation generating maximum power output regardless of system demand modsim requires power generation targets to optimize to meet the given generation targets and redirects the remaining flow down through the spillway a projection of future power demand and generating station priority ranking were out of the scope of this study 5 conclusions two basin scale hydrologic operations dynamically coupled models watflood modsim and hec hms modsim were run under 19 climate simulations to identify if there are detectable statistically significant changes in the reservoir supply and hydropower generation potential for the lnr complex the following key findings are noted 1 there is a disparity between high simulation agreement on climatic variables and low agreement on reservoir inflow and consequently hydropower generation potential 2 although there are statistically significant trends and shifts in reservoir inflow and hydropower generation potential detectable within the 19 climate simulations there is insufficient agreement and a lack of statistical significance on the direction of trend and mean ensemble change 3 there is limited 6 uncertainty contributed from hydrologic model selection relative to variations due to the climate simulation in part related to the location and function of the study basin i e being an outlet basin despite the lack of climate simulation agreement extreme climate simulations e g ialr81 and mr3r41 indicate divergent futures with wet projections become wetter and dry become drier over time winter a historically high hydropower demand season is projected to be the most vulnerable under the extreme dry scenario showing the greatest percent reduction 35 and 37 in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 respectively and the least percent increase 15 and 26 in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 respectively in reservoir inflow and therefore hydropower generation potential this is potentially problematic when considering the need to meet future electricity demands however warmer temperatures could offset increasing winter demand in the future to examine such effects coupled socioeconomic and hydrologic modeling scenarios are required and recommended as future work in spring the historical flood season we find the least percent reduction 22 and 22 in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 respectively and highest percent increases 23 and 33 in 2021 2050 and 2041 2070 respectively in reservoir inflow increasing the potential for spilling to manage higher system inflow it is noted that under modeled operations and infrastructure the lnrb river reservoir system does not fully utilize the projected increase in reservoir inflow after a certain threshold capacity limiting the increase in 30 year mean generation potential this could be potentially offset by changes in future system operations in response to changing hydrologic conditions which again can only be explored through more sophisticated coupled models that account for human decision making however if flows consistently increase and the basin becomes wetter it is likely that modifications to the production system i e generation capacity will be needed to leverage additional inflow for efficient hydropower generation this study indicates that the historical operation and infrastructure within the lnrb may be vulnerable under extreme climates and that further research incorporating the newest infrastructure keeyask and projected power demand is required to plan for new operational guidelines credit authorship contribution statement sj kim methodology development of software validation

the fen quickly evolved from a bare ground carbon source 2013 to a sedge dominated carex aquatilis carbon sink 2015 slower growth rate of trees pinus banksiana populus balsamifera and dry edaphic upland conditions initially resulted in net carbon losses however as upland vegetation became established plant co2 uptake increased after 2015 fen wue remained relatively stable despite fluctuations in seasonal rainfall stable wue reflects a well connected groundwater network between the two landscape units that supports hydrological self regulation sufficient to maintain adequate plant function because of this groundwater supply fen plants were no longer dependent solely on precipitation increasing resilience to intervals of periodic water stress overall carbon and water dynamics during

athabasca oil sands region aosr encompasses an area of 93 259 km2 within the wbp of northeastern alberta of which 5 4800 km2 is considered minable for oilsands extraction abmi 2017 here one method of resource extraction consists of widespread surface mining where up to 75 m of substrate below the ground surface are removed resulting in a fully altered disturbed landscape and subsequent loss of vital ees nwaishi et al 2015a notably rooney et al 2012 estimate aosr mining activities will result in a potential net loss of 11 4 47 3 tg of stored soil carbon as of 2016 901 km2 of land in the aosr has been impacted by mining activities government of alberta 2017b companies operating in the aosr have a statutory obligation to return leased land to pre disturbance equivalent land capability defined as post reclamation landscapes that can support ecosystem services and functions similar to what existed prior to disturbance alberta environment 2008 however the resulting reclaimed landscape may not necessarily be identical to the pre disturbance landscape poscente and charette 2011 alberta environment 2008 as reclamation efforts in the region typically use mine waste materials i e tailing sand petroleum coke as construction substrates the trajectory and end result of reclaimed systems is likely to result in a hybrid or novel landscape these landscapes may be physically different but functionally similar to natural pre disturbance landscapes as the structural and hydrogeochemical characteristics of construction materials used in aosr reclamation endeavours are vastly different than those found in natural systems nwaishi et al 2015a daly et al 2012 the pre disturbance landscape of the aosr comprises a mosaic of upland forests 23 and wetlands 54 aep 2018 rooney et al 2012 which are largely fen peatlands daly et al 2012 chee and vitt 1989 initially reclamation endeavours in the aosr focused solely on reclaiming to upland forests however due to the extensive occurrence of peatlands their specific ecosystem services i e carbon storage and hydrologic interconnectivity between uplands and peatlands fens have begun to be integrated into regional reclamation efforts ketcheson et al 2016 due to the magnitude of disturbance reclamation endeavours require the complete reengineering of surface topography and subsurface stratigraphy in addition to the initiation of vegetation through planting campaigns reestablishment of hydrological connectivity is critical to the evolution and success of reclaimed landscapes due to water requirements of key ecohydrological and biogeochemical functions particularly in peatlands i e inundated conditions stable near surface water table daly et al 2012 elshorbagy et al 2005 ensuring adequate water for ecosystem function in the aosr is further complicated by the sub humid climate of the region where annual evapotranspiration commonly exceeds precipitation resulting in frequent periods of water stress bothe and abraham 1993 moreover this water stress is expected to worsen in the area according to climate projections thompson et al 2017 ireson et al 2015 devito et al 2012 the availability and use of water in an ecosystem is critical to successful development and function and is controlled mainly by the storage capacity of soils and vegetation rodriguez iturbe and porporato 2004 thus reclamation design in the aosr needs to ensure adequate water availability for successful ecosystem development and function while accounting for the limited water availability the overarching goal of reclamation in the region is to create functional self sustaining resilient ecosystems as such benchmarks encompassing ecologic hydrologic and industry perspectives of ecosystem performance have been defined daly et al 2012 and successful reclamation requires an ecosystem to be 1 capable of supporting a representative assemblage of species 2 carbon accumulating and 3 able to withstand periodic environmental stress as aosr fen reclamation is a relatively new endeavour quantifiable metrics for evaluating the trajectory success and long term sustainability of reclamation projects is required as it is difficult to directly measure ecosystem function through a single metric the evaluation of reclamation performance has typically relied on the measurement of a large number of ecosystem variables e g soil properties and geochemistry vegetation surveys biomass water use under the premise that in aggregate these variables will reflect ecosystem function and land capability however this approach has limitations such as data on a large number of variables can be onerous to collect and impossible to appropriately integrate variables may be poor indicators of actual function measured variables may reflect current site performance but fail to provide information on site stability under changing conditions and on broader landscape level performance alternatively a focus on fewer biologically integrative factors or on emergent properties may be more effective straker et al 2019 strilesky et al 2017 nwaishi et al 2015a ecosystem water and carbon dynamics are integrative indicators of a suite of supporting ecosystem processes and characteristics for example water use efficiency wue which links photosynthesis with water use provides a useful metric to evaluate the use of water and carbon resources by plants as such assessment of the efficiency of ecosystem water use provides important insight on resiliency to climatic variation and on landscape level water storage and yield net ecosystem exchange nee captures the net exchange i e photosynthesis and respiration of carbon between an ecosystem and the atmosphere and is a primary gauge of ecosystem carbon sink capacity the overall carbon sink capacity of an ecosystem is dependent on edaphic conditions water availability and plant community composition thus integration of ecosystem scale measurements of carbon exchange coupled with remote sensing metrics for plant development provides an efficient integrative measure of reclamation performance and early successional trajectory to date only two pilot projects assessing reclamation design and performance have been constructed in the aosr considerable research on early hydrological functioning biagi et al 2021 ketcheson et al 2017 hydrochemistry

abraham 1993 nfw was designed based on numerical modelling of ideal geometries and substrate materials for successful ecosystem function within the wbp climate while satisfying vegetation water requirements and facilitating peat accumulation price et al 2010 moreover the system is designed to function in a simplified but analogous manner to fen upland ecosystems common in undisturbed landscapes of the wbp where uplands supply groundwater to downgradient peatlands wells et al 2017 elmes and price 2019 as such there is no manual manipulation of the water table at nfw hydrological inputs to the system include precipitation and surface runoff from the surrounding previously reclaimed hillslopes fig 1 a and fen hydrology is dependent on the down gradient transport of water from the upland aquifer sutton and price 2020a ketcheson et al 2016 surface water is discharged through an outflow located in the northeastern corner of the fen a complete account of nfw hydrological functioning is given in ketcheson et al 2017 construction of the upland fen complex began in 2012 and concluded in january 2013 planting and revegetation were initiated in june 2013 in 2014 additional peat was added to the fen in an attempt to counter ponding and additional tamarack seedlings were planted in the upland the upland surface was subsequently modified through tillage to create furrows perpendicular to flow to limit excessive overland flow increase recharge to the upland aquifer and better facilitate development of plant rooting architecture sutton and price 2020a gingras hill et al 2018 ketcheson et al 2017 daly et al 2012 in june 2015 a subsequent upland planting campaign occurred to actualize desired stand density 10 188 additional tree and shrub saplings gingras hill et al 2018 materials used in construction included locally and readily available recovered materials from mining operations such as by products of the bitumen extraction process tailing sand petroleum coke and salvaged overburden peat and forest mineral soils from the initial clearing of natural landscapes on oil sands leases daly et al 2012 in addition to being abundantly available these recovered materials were used as they had the appropriate hydrophysical properties for recreating the requisite hydrologic connectivity price et al 2010 the constructed upland fen complex is underlain by an impermeable engineered geotextile clay liner 0 05 m thick which encourages lateral flow while limiting deep water loss to the regional water table fig 1d above the liner is a 0 5 m thick layer of tailing sand overlain by a 0 5 m thick layer of petroleum coke which extends beneath the fen and partway into the upland acting as a highly permeable underdrain to improve hydrological connectivity and more evenly distribute water and solute flows beneath the fen fig 1d simhayov et al 2017 daly et al 2012 the entire system was constructed on and due to the clay liner is hydrologically isolated from a fine textured over burden dump fig 1d in the upland 2 3 m of tailing sand creates an aquifer to support transport of water from upland to fen due to its relatively high hydraulic conductivity sutton and price 2020a however these physical properties also result in poor moisture retention which in turn impedes plant growth and development fung and macyk 2015 moreover as a by product of bitumen extraction tailing sand contains residual amounts of highly mobile solutes namely sodium na amongst other constituents simhayov et al 2017 rezanezhad et al 2012 which can affect water quality

measurements are supplemented with other vegetation metrics to provide a more accurate description of vegetation characteristics non destructive vegetation surveys were conducted annually during peak growing season in the fen 60 60 cm collars installed for chamber based co2 flux measurements were used as the survey area n 32 where percent cover of vascular plant species litter bare ground and

as the two landscapes are adjacent to one another meteorological variables such as tair and p were consistent between the two landscapes differences between the two landscapes were most apparent in edaphic conditions and vegetation 4 1 1 climatic conditions tair throughout the growing seasons varied between 4 36 c fig 3b while average seasonal temperatures ranged between 15 5 and 19 3 c and were

water table depth wtd fluctuated slightly in the fen between wetter 2014 2018 2019 and drier years 2015 2017 the largest range in fen wtd was in the year following construction 2013 13 to 45 cm bgs however the initially low wt was during the wetting up period of the fen mean upland wtd ranged between 158 cm bgs in 2014 257 in 2019 in both landscapes smaller scale 10 mm sporadic rain events appear to have a negligible impact on wtd position however larger or recurring rain events 2018 or prolonged dry periods 2017 influenced wtd fig 4a c edaphic conditions between the two landscapes varied significantly due to differences in substrate that affect the soil water holding capacity and the aforementioned differences in wtd fen soil temperatures varied from 4 sept 2014 to 29 c june

to remain relatively stable with only slight increases occurring during large rain events however prolonged dry periods in the fen led to a decline in moisture content in the near surface top 5 cm as exhibited in 2017 when values dropped from 85 down to 72 fig 4d during wetter years fen vwc measured at 15 cm depth was 2 6 drier than the upper near surface peat while the opposite trend emerged

the overarching goal of reclamation in the region is to create functional self sustaining resilient ecosystems as there is no singular metric or definition for ecosystem function benchmarks encompassing ecologic hydrologic and industry perspectives of ecosystem performance have been defined for nfw daly et al 2012 here successful reclamation requires an ecosystem to be 1 capable of supporting a representative assemblage of species 2 carbon accumulating and 3 able to withstand periodic environmental stress 5 1 1 capacity for supporting representative species assemblage plants play a fundamental role in nutrient carbon and water cycling as the central conduit between surface atmosphere exchanges driven by climatic and hydrological conditions brümmer et al 2012 limpens et al 2008 bubier et al 2003 particularly in peatlands plant community composition and species specific phenologies control carbon uptake through plant productivity peichl et al 2018 and quality of litter deposited ultimately affecting rates of peat formation trites and bayley 2009 specific to reclaimed aosr landscapes planting prescriptions must ensure efficient water use and ability to function under the expected range of environmental i e saline conditions during ecosystem evolution in the fen both vascular and bryophyte species were introduced through a number of planting treatments see borkenhagen and cooper 2019 by year 3 2015 fen vascular vegetation was widespread and robust consisting predominantly of carex aquatilis and to lesser extents juncus balticus typha latifolia calamagrostis inexpansa and triglochin martima a similar rapid expansion of sedge species has also been observed at a nearby reclaimed fen sandhill fen sfw clark 2018 vitt et al 2016 and several post disturbance fen landscapes in alberta including restored seismic lines davidson et al 2021 and well pads lemmer et al 2020 bryophyte establishment following moss transfer did occur at nfw but at a much lesser rate than expected likely due to the rapid expansion of sedge species due to its tolerance of saline conditions ptychostomum pseudotriquetrum has become the dominant bryophyte species occurring throughout nfw fen although other bryophyte species calliergon giganteum campylium stellatum drepanocladus aduncus drepanocladus polygamous leptobryum pyriforme are also present borkenhagen and cooper 2019 similar to nearby natural saline fens volik et al 2018 and sandhill fen watershed hartsock et al 2021 vitt et al 2016 the spatial extent of plant assemblages at nfw fen was driven largely by water table position and salinity as observed in other restored and reclaimed peatland landscapes poulin et al 2013 vitt et al 2016 typha latifolia colonized most of the ponded standing water regions of the fen widespread establishment of invasive t latifolia may be problematic for reclamation performance as it decays quickly and is not a peat forming species which may affect long term peatland function borkenhagen and cooper 2019 trites and baylay 2009 shih and finkelstein 2008 between 2014 and 2019 fen plant assemblages evolved coinciding with changes in soil and water salinity fresh water sedge and grass species in the fen such as carex aurea carex disperma and hierochloe hitra peaked in 2015 but were then rare or absent following increased levels of mobile sodium borkenhagen and cooper 2019 species with a larger range of salt tolerance such as juncus balticus calamagrostis inexpansa and triglochin martima persisted and even expanded in some plots with increased salinity in 2018 the fen experienced the highest in flux of sodium during the study period table 2 kessel et al 2018 sutton 2021 resulting in visible salt stress in carex aquatilis and typha latifolia observed yellowing in foliage and early senescence of some plots in recent years clusters of betula pumila and salix pedicellaris have developed in persistently drier regions of the fen overall the fen plant community at nfw was representative of natural saline fens in the region volik et al 2018 purdy et al 2005 chee and vitt 1989 however plant succession and trajectory towards herbaceous or more marsh like vegetation may occur and could have implications on long term carbon dynamics for this site in the future evolution of upland vegetation occurred at a much slower rate than the fen use of salvaged forest floor materials as a capping layer is common practice in forest reclamation efforts in the region rowland et al 2009 prentice 2020 irving 2020 as it supports soil water retention necessary for plant growth sutton and price 2020a and provides propagules of species common to natural boreal forests pinno and hawkes 2015 mackenzie and quideau 2010 early successional upland species at nfw were markedly different than that of other naturally regenerating forests e g post fire post harvest due to dry conditions and hydrochemistry however similar to other reclaimed uplands strilesky et al 2017 mackenzie and quideau 2010 rowland et al 2009 the initial 5 years following construction nfw upland consisted of a patchy understory comprising invasive forbs and grasses sonchus arvensis and agropyron tracycaulum and dry bare ground although counter intuitive these non native early successional species were critical to the emergence and development of planted tree species they facilitated improved soil structure through rhizosphere development as well as litter layer establishment which resulted in the addition of labile organic matter and nutrients padilla et al 2009 gómez aparicio et al 2004 maestre et al 2001 trees became prominent by year 5 2017 and consisted of both broadleaf populus tremuloides populus balsamifera and coniferous picea mariana pinus banksiana species native to the region as of 2019 the understory consisted of shrubs graminoids and forbs and trees were becoming the dominant vegetation type notably populus tremuloides was never planted in the upland however wind blown seeds were likely dispersed from the nearby previously reclaimed slopes growth and timing of development of nfw upland tree species was similar to that of other reclaimed uplands in the region strilesky et al 2017 remote sensing has been increasingly applied to peatland and post disturbance studies as a means to identify plant community development and succession following disturbance chasmer et al 2020 lees et al 2018 in this study the derivation of remotely sensed evi provided a more complete temporal and spatial record of plant emergence and development than fields methods alone once plant communities were established evi values measured at nfw were comparable to that of surrounding natural sites fig 5 and on par

forest jahan and gan 2011 ranging between 0 3 and 0 6 during peak season although the timing of vegetative development varied between the two landscapes planting campaigns paired with adequate edaphic conditions resulted in establishment of a diverse plant community comprising largely native species while saline fens are uncommon they do exist in the wbp and are within the scope of acceptable reclamation targets province of alberta 2020 due to the specific altered hydrochemical and physical state of the substrate materials used in reclamation e g unstratified compressed or dried peat presence of naphthenic acids mobile sodium in tailing sand nicholls et al 2016 nwaishi et al 2015b kessel et al 2018 biagi et al 2021 plant succession and system evolution may take on a transformed novel trajectory from the pre disturbance landscape nwaishi et al 2015a assigning common landscape classification to these novel ecosystems is less relevant in reclamation and of greater importance is the functionality of plant assemblages under present and future environmental conditions 5 1 2 carbon accumulation one of the key ecosystem functions performed by peatlands is net uptake of atmospheric co2 via photosynthesis and the long term storage of carbon as organic matter in peat and litter vasander and kettunen 2006 blodau 2002 gorham 1991 as nee is typically the largest component of northern peatland annual carbon budgets limpens et al 2008 nilsson et al 2008 roulet et al 2007 it was used here as a metric to quantify nfw s annual carbon function growing season results show significant progress towards ecosystem functionality from a co2 perspective the fen quickly evolved from a bare ground growing season source of co2 in 2013 to an extensively vegetated sink by 2015 243 g c m 2 moreover from 2015 onwards the fen has been sequestering co2 at rates comparable to nearby natural sites see section 5 3 while the upland was still a growing season source of co2 in 2019 46 g c m 2 there has been an increase in plant co2 uptake that is expected to continue as the canopy continues to develop as a result the nfw upland is on a trajectory towards becoming a net carbon sink in the near future 5 1 3 response to periodic environmental stress in the seven years following inception nfw has demonstrated resilience to periodic hydrologic stress as observed during wet and dry periods as well as during changes in water quality e g migration and influx of salts 5 1 3 1 resilience to hydrologic stress the wpb sub humid climate presents an additional challenge to reclamation in the region with moisture deficits and decadal dry cycles chasmer et al 2018 devito et al 2017 bothe and abraham 1993 climate change predictions for the region project an increase in both temperature and precipitation which may further exacerbate moisture deficits thompson et al 2018 ireson et al 2015 devito et al 2012 while increased precipitation will provide more water to the system increased temperatures will likely lengthen the growing season and enhance et additionally variability in the intensity frequency and amount of rainfall may have unknown effects on current ecohydrological feedbacks as such water availability and use are critical to the long term sustainability and performance of reclaimed systems in the aosr in all seven years during the study period fen et rates exceeded precipitation yet vegetation was able to grow develop and uptake co2 at rates comparable to natural sites see 5 3 below notably fen wue rates remained relatively stable fig 9 from 2015 onwards even during seasons with significantly less rainfall seasonal rainfall ranging from 168 to 285 mm season 1 stable wue is indicative of a well connected groundwater network between the upland and fen which resulted in sufficient hydrological self regulation during times of hydrologic stress additionally because fen vegetation developed significant rooting architecture 1 m depth in places messner 2019 it was able to access water even during prolonged dry periods that resulted in water table drawdown e g 2017 as a result the system had adequate plant water availability and plant function was not solely dependent on p inputs ultimately increasing resilience to future moisture deficits moreover fen wue rates once vegetation became established 2015 2019 average 1 8 1 3 g c kg h2o 1 day 1 were comparable to those observed at nearby natural fens c f 1 7 3 0 g c kg h2o 1 day 1 in volik et al 2021 currently the upland is supplying the fen with adequate water for ecohydrological functioning however it is uncertain if this will continue as the upland canopy continues to develop requiring more water and water deficits continue to worsen as trees continue to mature et rates are expected to increase strilesky et al 2017 and will likely lead to et p more frequently to date et p occurred only during dry years 2015 2017 moreover as the canopy develops more water is expected to be lost through evaporation of intercepted water resulting in less direct inputs into the soil fettah 2020 however studies of boreal aspen stands during drought conditions describe an efficient redistribution of water via aspen rooting systems petrone et al 2015 brown et al 2014 which may ensure enough water for plant function during periods of water stress in the upland furthermore sutton and price 2020a modelled the hydrologic effects of upland plant growth in nfw and concluded the system will likely be capable of providing sufficient groundwater to the fen and support the development and function of an upland forest however the system will likely be operating just within the margins of adequate water availability overall the current ecohydrological functioning of nfw is capable of adapting and coping with the climatic regime of the aosr 5 1 3 2 resilience to salt stress mitigating the effects of salinization from waste materials used in reclamation in the aosr is an ongoing challenge biagi et al 2019 kessel et al 2018 simhayov et al 2017 to date fen and upland vegetation have been able to develop and persist under current concentrations of na and electrical conductivity values table 2 however in 2018 carex aquatilis and typha latifolia exhibited signs of salt stress yellow foliage early senescence while nee in 2018 remained within the range of previous years and that of natural sites there was an observable decrease fig 6 7 table 4a and b additionally there was a decrease in biomass messner 2019 lai and evi values table 3 current hydrochemical conditions of nfw are still well within the range of levels observed at natural saline sites volik et al 2021 2019 hartsock et al 2021 esrd 2015 planting and establishment of species ranging in salt tolerance likely helped the fen continue functioning i e carbon uptake at a comparable rate to other years however prolonged exposure to saline conditions will likely result in a shift in the plant community and a decrease in carbon uptake capacity volik et al 2018 moreover a number of ecohydrological and biogeochemical processes decay rates nutrient acquisition plant water uptake etc may be affected by prolonged soil and water salinity which may ultimately affect the long term functionality of these landscapes nwaishi et al 2015a 5 2 drivers of ecosystem functionality and interannual variability results indicate that ecosystem function during the initial stages of development of a constructed reclaimed landscape is directly linked to the establishment and growth of vegetation however system design and construction are critical first steps as appropriate abiotic conditions such as substrate quality and water availability are required to initiate vegetation growth and persistence studies of boreal watersheds natural restored and constructed indicate that water table dynamics nutrient availability and hydrochemistry play a critical role in determining plant community composition volik et al 2020a borkenhagen and cooper 2019 spennato et al 2018 vitt et al 2016 dieleman et al 2015 koropchak et al 2012 trites and bayley 2009 eppinga et al 2009a strack et al 2006 lavoie et al 2005 the relatively quick initiation of a widespread and robust sedge community in the fen was likely facilitated by planting and initial growth occurring in relatively wet years 2013 2014 fig 3 a as well as the relatively quick initiation of stable near surface water table conditions following construction fig 4c in reclaimed aosr uplands growth and persistence of plants is driven by available soil moisture which is facilitated largely by cover soil composition and thickness sutton and price 2020a gingras hill et al 2018 spatial variability in the timing of plant emergence in the nfw upland fig 5a was linked to the heterogeneity of soil conditions i e moisture and nutrient availability soil moisture and capping layer thickness maps created by sutton and price 2020a of nfw correspond strongly to evi imagery presented in this study fig 5a particularly during early development 2014 2016 where areas of thicker capping materials 30 cm and in turn higher vwc promoted earlier plant establishment and more consistent robust growth 5 2 1 interannual variability of carbon fluxes results from peatland restoration strack et al 2014 strack and zuback 2013 samaritani et al 2011 waddington et al 2010 petrone et al 2001 and post disturbance afforestation efforts strilesky et al 2017 dhar et al 2018 petrone et al 2015 mkhabela et al 2009 indicate revegetation activities greatly reduce carbon losses and can return degraded ecosystems to carbon sinks over time in both nfw landscapes carbon uptake improved substantially with development of vegetation fig 7 table 4 in established plant communities seasonal variability in carbon fluxes is largely controlled by plant physiology growing season length par and meteorological conditions baldocchi et al 2018 charman et al 2013 brümmer et al 2012 barr et al 2007 falge et al 2002 law et al 2002 bubier et al 1998 examination of interannual variability in carbon fluxes in years following plant establishment fen 2015 2019 fig 6 and 7 suggests a response to environmental changes notably in 2017 the fen received only 61 mm of rainfall between july september compared to 154 mm in 2018 and 208 mm in 2019 resulting in a decrease in water table position and vwc fig 3 as such there was a decrease in daily gep rates and nee fig 6a 7 a in 2017 during this dry period compared to wetter years e g 2018 and 2019 however it s important to note that carbon uptake continued during this time albeit at a lesser rate likely due to stomatal closure to limit water loss daily gep rates during the 2017 dry period 3 6 1 4 g c m 2 day 1 were comparable to those of nearby within 40 km natural sites in the region experiencing similar meteorological conditions at the time daily gep between 1 5 and 4 1 g c m 2 day 1 volik et al 2021 moreover a similar gep decrease under warming or drying conditions has been reported in rich fens adkinson et al 2011 and sedge dominated microforms in a poor fen strack et al 2006 however other studies in open treed fens have shown contradictory results where gep increased under warming or drying conditions flanagan et al 2010 cai et al 2010 moreover bryophyte dominated microforms showed less response to changing conditions strack et al 2006 thus the response of gep in peatlands to changing environmental conditions is complex non linear and likely controlled by site specific variables i e plant community and edaphic conditions and the overall amplitude of change semeraro et al 2019 moreover the timing and frequency of rain events produced interseasonal variability in carbon fluxes in 2018 rainfall events were intense but less frequent including 28 days with no rain between doy 206 234 fig 2 table 2 which contrasted with 2019 where there was weekly and for some parts of the season daily smaller rainfall events as a result there was variability between the two years in the number of overcast days which limited par and ultimately plant productivity as such 2018 exhibited higher daily gep rates than 2019 fig 6 even though both years received a similar amount of total precipitation in particular there was a clear decrease in co2 uptake in the afternoon hours of 2019 fig 7 due to lower par and overcast conditions compared to the same time of year in 2017 and 2018 similarly nijp et al 2015 examined the effects of daytime rain events on nee during an 11 year study in northern sweden and found that reduced light availability due to cloud cover during rain events reduced net ecosystem co2 uptake on average by 0 23 0 54 g c m 2 day 1 or 4 4 decrease in gep throughout a growing season growing season length coupled with the timing of plant emergence also affects seasonal carbon fluxes charman et al 2013 there was a distinct temporal trend in the timing of plant emergence throughout fen evolution in earlier years 2015 plant emergence green up and subsequent carbon uptake occurred quickly by doy 136 fig 7 due to low plant competition adequate edaphic conditions and little to no litter layer from 2017 onwards a delay in plant emergence was observed with daily carbon uptake beginning later each year doy 146 150 160 for 2017 2018 2019 this delay is likely attributed to persistence of winter conditions and ice lenses pulliainen et al 2017 charman et al 2013 aurela et al 2004 and accumulation of a relatively thick litter layer mean litter layer thickness 12 6 2 cm 2017 and 17 8 9 5 2019 table 3 resulting in new growth requiring more energy and time to emerge moreover there was variability in the timing of plant emergence and thus plant productivity and co2 sequestration between the fen and upland figure 7ab timing of nee signal 2017 2019 due to differences in plant community composition 5 2 2 interannual variability in et nfw et was strongly coupled to water availability and development of vegetation as was previously noted at nfw scarlett et al 2017 and related boreal studies brown et al 2010 petrone et al 2001 price et al 1998 lafleur 1990 early in its development 2013 2014 the fen surface was bare and dominated by dark wet peat and large ponded areas fig 1 as a result et was high 326 and 424 mm growing season 1 and close to pet here et rates were largely driven by high surface evaporation similar to those measured off a boreal pond petrone et al 2007 as vegetation developed and became widespread ponded and bare regions were reduced and et rates were subsequently driven by plant transpiration 2015 onwards fen et began to decrease and stabilize as vegetation became established and fully developed fig 8 furthermore similar to the straw mulch technique used in peatland restoration petrone et al 2004 rochefort 2000 price et al 1998 development of a thick fen litter layer was likely limiting large fluctuations in surface soil temperatures and impeding surface evaporative losses 2017 onwards the slight increase in fen et in 2018 was attributed to the large intense rain fall event 86 mm over 4 days fig 3 a which resulted in extensive flooding and an increase in surface evaporation while 2018 and 2019 were both wetter years total growing season rainfalls of 278 and 285 mm the frequency and intensity of events differed 2018 had less frequent more intense events whereas 2019 consisted of frequent small rain events differences in et trends between these two years were a clear example of how changes in intensity timing and frequency of rainfall can impact ecohydrological dynamics upland et rates increased from 2017 onwards as trees matured five years post construction and planting fig 8 strilesky et al 2017 reported an increase in et by 62 as tree cover became established within the first ten years of a nearby reclaimed forest amiro et al 2006a 2006b describe a similar increase in et coinciding with growth of regenerating boreal forests post wildfire drivers of ecosystem functionality varied during development initially abiotic factors such as soil and water chemistry availability of water and nutrients and adequate substrate quality paired with climatic conditions dictated the timing growth success and type of plant community development once a plant community became established plant physiology and phenology drove early carbon and water fluxes notably successful development of these early plant communities is likely to dictate future trajectories and overall success of the system as these early plant communities initiate and control key ecohydrological and biogeochemical feedbacks i e nutrient input litter quality decay rate carbon uptake necessary for ecosystem function once vegetation was well established interannual fluctuations in carbon and water fluxes were once again driven by environmental factors similar to natural ecosystems nfw was able to continue functioning through interannual fluctuations in environmental conditions see 5 1 3 response to periodic stress however prolonged environmental stressors may lead to a plant successional shift scheffer 2010 eppinga et al 2009 in the future at which point carbon and water fluxes would again be largely impacted by changes in plant form and function 5 3 comparison of nfw net ecosystem exchange rates to natural and post disturbance landscapes to contextualize the results and performance of nfw nee results were compared to natural and post disturbance aosr peatlands and forests fig 10 summarises total growing season nee versus age following disturbance while providing a mean range of values recorded at natural sites blue band following plant emergence 2014 the nfw fen has remained a co2 sink throughout the study period with growing season nee ranging between 69 to 215 g c m 2 table 4 currently only two upland wetland pilot ecosystems this study nikanotee fen watershed nfw and sandhill fen watershed sfw have been constructed to test the design and feasibility of reclamation projects in the region the two systems were guided by different conceptual approaches and test differing designs ketcheson et al 2016 briefly nfw utilized numerical modelling for landscape optimization while sfw was designed to mimic the water conserving function of natural fen systems based on their low lying landscape position both systems were constructed using similar materials i e by products of the bitumen extraction process albeit at variable thicknesses e g peat thickness of 2 m at nfw vs 0 5 m at sfw and included planting campaigns a notable difference between the two systems is water transport and storage in an attempt to combat the frequent periods of water stress common to the region and ensure ample inundated conditions for fen evolution sfw was built with pumps to allow for the active management of water inputs and withdrawals as such the system has no natural outflow for surface and near surface water ketcheson et al 2016 biagi et al 2021 contrastingly there is no manual water table manipulation at nfw fen groundwater inputs are solely supplied from the upgradient upland and water is discharged gravitational through a natural flowing outlet remarkably these two reclaimed peatlands follow a similar carbon trajectory despite differences in conceptual designs and water management techniques clark 2018 ketcheson et al 2016 likely due to the rapid initiation of plant growth immediately following construction at both sites the peatlands become growing season co2 sinks within 3 years following construction at uptake rates comparable to nearby natural sites fig 10 a clark 2018 report a growing season net co2 uptake of 194 g c m 2 and 112 g c m 2 in the lowland and midland of sfw by year 3 fig 10 a natural fens across the boreal exhibit a wide range of nee values both between sites and interannually within a single site attributed to differences in plant community composition edaphic conditions and responses to hydrological dynamics and meteorological influences volik et al 2021 loisel and yu 2013 charman et al 2013 gažovič et al 2013 adkinson et al 2011 lund et al 2010 strack et al 2006 a variety of natural nearby within 40 km of nfw fens have been concurrently monitored during the study period including a moderately treed poor fen pauciflora fen heavily treed moderate rich fen poplar fen and a saline fen system saline fen growing season nee values for these nearby natural sites pauciflora poplar and saline ranged between 92 to 196 g c m 2 pauciflora 25 to 207 g c m 2 poplar and 89 to 54 g c m 2 saline volik et al 2021 here variability between sites is attributed largely to differences in plant community treed with moss vs sedge and hydrochemistry with the saline site exhibiting lower rates of gep due to salinity inhibiting plant productivity volik et al 2021 similarly morison et al 2020 report nee values of 25 and 130 g c m 2 in a two year study of an undisturbed poor fen in north central alberta within this time frame 2013 2014 adkinson et al 2011 also report interannual variability in nee in a sedge dominated extreme rich fen in northern alberta 35 154 42 g c m 2 while nee from a nearby moss dominated poor fen was similar across the study period 110 1 0 5 g c m 2 further depicting the range of plant communities found in the region and their varying responses to fluctuating environmental conditions typically vascular vegetation is more sensitive to environmental changes such as wt drawdown than mosses due to the high water holding capacity of moss kokkonen et al 2019 laine et al 2021 cai et al 2010 measured june september nee in an alberta treed fen over two years and reported higher values of 282 and 207 g c m 2 likely attributed to the prominent robust mature woody vegetation nfw fen growing season nee falls well within the range of values reported at natural undisturbed sites fig 10 a while peatland reclamation is a novel concept peatland restoration is not and numerous ongoing peatland restoration endeavours provide suitable analogies of ecosystem recovery results from both nfw and sfw depict the importance of plant community development and emergence on ecosystem function and evolution initially following construction prior to plant emergence both nfw and sfw functioned as carbon sources 70 nfw 112 sfw lowland 96 sfw midland g c m 2 waddington et al 2010 measured nee in a cutover bog in quebec bois de bel pre and post restoration and reported a seasonal net co2 loss of 245 g c m 2 prior to restoration petrone et al 2003 reported on the first two years post restoration of the aforementioned site at which point co2 emissions remained high 478 and 468 g c m 2 due to the lack of a complete cover of carbon fixing vegetation and high respiration rates from decomposing mulch similarly high co2 losses were observed during the initial year of study at adjacent restored and unrestored peatlands 445 504 g c m 2 nugent et al 2019 in northern alberta furthermore rankin et al 2018 reports that an unrestored peatland continues to function as a net co2 source 173 and 259 g c m 2 15 and 16 years post disturbance moreover timing of the return to carbon sink capacity varies amongst post disturbance sites and has been observed by year 3 in a restored cut away peatland tuittila et al 1999 and year 14 at bois de bel nugent et al 2018 strack and zuback 2013 measured co2 fluxes at bois de bel ten years following restoration however the system was still functioning as a carbon source due to wt drawdown and drier conditions resulting in increased rates of respiration differences in the rate and timing of carbon uptake in post disturbance landscapes is largely driven by vegetation dynamics i e vegetation emergence and establishment plant community composition and environmental conditions particularly edaphic conditions where dry conditions exacerbate respiration rapid emergence of wide spread vascular vegetation stable edaphic conditions and development of a thick litter layer resulted in gep rates continually exceeding respiration at nfw fen resulting in a return to carbon sink capacity comparable to natural and restored sites natural saline fen volik et al 2021 and restored strack and zuback 2013 peatlands exhibit periods of seasonal or short term carbon losses typically prompted by changes in water availability or hydrochemistry which can each inhibit plant productivity as of 2019 nfw fen has shown resilience to environmental stressors and is expected to continue functioning in terms of carbon uptake like natural sites barring any major successional shifts in vegetation although there have been numerous studies assessing upland reclamation treatment materials mackenzie and quideau 2010 naeth et al 2013 pinno and hawkes 2015 and soil structure and function sutton and price 2020b gingras hill et al 2018 dietrich mackenzie 2018 rowland et al 2009 there have been limited long term studies of carbon and water dynamics of aosr reclaimed uplands straker et al 2019 strilesky et al 2017 moreover mature stand dynamics can vary from that of juvenile or regenerating forest systems goulden et al 2011 as such here post disturbance i e fire harvest regenerating boreal forests are discussed to provide context of early results and trajectory of our nfw upland upland wbp forests range from broadleaf leaf aspen dominated to coniferous forests comprised of black spruce jack pine and tamaracks and less frequently mixed forest comprised of both tree types forest type is a key driver of carbon dynamics as broadleaf forests typically have higher leaf area gep and ultimately co2 uptake than coniferous species brümmer et al 2012 of the seven mature 40 years old forests summarised in fig 10b broad leaf forests had the highest mean growing season uptake 182 104 g c m 2 followed by mixed tree stands 73 57 g c m 2 and coniferous stands 7 40 g c m 2 fig 10b as of 2019 year 7 nfw upland was still a source of co2 emitting 46 g c m 2 however it is on a trajectory to becoming a carbon sink in the next 3 5 years which is on par with the assessments of carbon dynamics in regenerating forests for example amiro et al 2010 2006a examined a number of mature post harvest and post fire forests across boreal regions of north america and reported that most sites became carbon sinks ten years following disturbance goulden et al 2011 examined co2 exchanges in stands ranging in age from 1 to 154 years post disturbance and found a similar temporal trend where 1 to 6 year old sites were losing carbon emitting between 11 and 192 g c m 2 15 year old sites were beginning to gain carbon 21 to 32 g c m 2 sequestered and any sites over 25 were sequestering carbon 40 to 110 g c m 2 at rates comparable to mature natural sites the lag in carbon sequestration rates in juvenile forests is attributed to the small stature and low lai of saplings as well as respiration losses from bare forest floor previously reclaimed uplands in the aosr south bison hill and cell11a on fig 10b exhibited an increase in co2 uptake almost immediately following planting due to the emergence and rapid expansion of understory vegetation once trees mature these uplands perform on par or better than mature forests mean total seasonal nee of 216 g c m 2 for a mixed forest and 107 g c m 2 for a jack pine dominated landscape straker et al 2019 similar to aosr wetlands forest carbon function is sensitive to environmental changes particularly hydrologic stress petrone et al 2015 examined two regenerating aspen dominated stands and reported a return to carbon sink function by year 3 from 425 to 17 g c m 2 between years 1 3 followed by subsequent co2 losses in years 4 5 201 and 180 g c m 2 due to the persistence of drought like conditions a significant increase in tree growth and foliage in the nfw upland from 2017 onwards resulted in a marked increase in gep and overall co2 uptake however due to the sparse understory and rather dry edaphic conditions respiration rates remained high throughout the study period this was in contrast to juvenile post fire sites where respiration rates are typically lower in the initial years following fire as burnt soil and fire residue take longer to decompose czimczik et al 2006 litvak et al 2003 nevertheless as the canopy continues to mature gep is expected to increase and eventually overtake respiration as the dominant carbon flux at our upland site currently the upland is following a similar trajectory to other regenerating forested systems and is expected to regain function as a carbon sink within the next 3 5 years 6 conclusions this study captured what was likely the most dynamic period of nfw evolution characterized by the rapid transition from a barren landscape to a flourishing ecosystem comparable to natural analogues in the region beginning in the first year post construction to the present the system experienced rapid growth and establishment of vegetation by 2015 in the fen and 2017 in the upland and changing hydrochemical conditions results indicate ecosystem functionality namely carbon and water fluxes were largely controlled by plant growth and establishment the fen quickly evolved from a carbon source in 2013 to a stable carbon sink by 2015 total seasonal nee of 70 to 243 g c m 2 the slower growth rate of trees coupled with dry edaphic conditions in the upland resulted in net carbon losses during the study period nee of 519 46 g c m 2 from 2013 to 2019 similarly wue rates in both the fen and upland showed a marked increase once vegetation became established moreover plant function and carbon uptake were able to persist throughout dry years indicating sufficient hydrological connectivity between the two landscapes and ecosystem resilience to intervals of periodic water stress interannual variability of fluxes suggested that plant communities are exhibiting typical responses to environmental changes as these responses mirror those of natural sites in the surrounding area experiencing similar conditions barring a successional shift caused by prolonged saline or dry conditions water and carbon fluxes of both landscapes are expected to stabilize and future fluctuations are predicted to be controlled by meteorological influences assessment of co2 and water exchanges provided sufficient evidence that the system is currently operating as intended and functioning comparably to undisturbed landscapes fen or post disturbance landscapes of a similar age and plant community upland persistent saline conditions will likely result in a shift to more salt tolerant species in the future which may decrease rates of plant productivity and carbon sequestration while it is difficult to definitively predict future abiotic conditions and thus ecosystem trajectories the fen will likely evolve towards a plant community and ecosystem functionality similar to that of fens in the region the upland will likely be capable of supporting a forest of similar density to undisturbed sites and continue supplying adequate water to the down gradient fen a limitation of this research is that nfw is a pilot project and thus the only current example of this design as such it may not reflect the only successional path of future reclamation endeavours particularly if designs are adjusted or baseline environmental conditions change thus as future reclamation endeavours are initiated carbon and water fluxes along with plant development should continue to be monitored to improve our knowledge base moreover as the nfw is still in a juvenile phase and hydrochemistry is expected to continue changing future work should include continued monitoring particularly if there is a shift in plant communities lastly as this study only focused on co2 fluxes future work should include a complete carbon balance for the site to accurately assess carbon accumulation and storage this study is currently the longest reported record of carbon and water dynamics of a reclaimed upland fen complex in the aosr assessment of ecohydrological dynamics during early development suggests that the constructed system is evolving towards becoming a self sustaining carbon accumulating functional ecosystem this study demonstrates that fen reclamation is possible and can be successful in the aosr moreover this study applied a functional based approach focused on a few critical ecohydrological variables co2 and wue measured using ecosystem scale techniques eddy covariance and remote sensing analysis the methods used here provide a feasible approach for capturing temporal ecosystem evolution and functionality following construction and could prove useful especially for large scale or remote reclamation endeavours where field work is not possible this research provides a unique opportunity to assess surface atmosphere interactions during the early successional stage of ecosystem development ultimately improving our understanding of ecohydrological processes ecohydrological insights gained from this study on the function and evolution of constructed landscapes will aid reclamation practitioners regulatory decision makers and mine operators in the future design of reclamation endeavours in the region moreover the rapid return of carbon sink capacity illustrated in this study paired with the ability for ecosystem functionality to persist in the water limited setting of the aosr may prove useful outside of the realm of reclamation as

vital ees nwaishi et al 2015a notably rooney et al 2012 estimate aosr mining activities will result in a potential net loss of 11 4 47 3 tg of stored soil carbon as of 2016 901 km2 of land in the aosr has been impacted by mining activities government of alberta 2017b companies operating in the aosr have a statutory obligation to return leased land to pre disturbance equivalent land capability defined as post reclamation landscapes that can support ecosystem services and functions similar to what existed prior to disturbance alberta environment 2008 however the resulting reclaimed landscape may not necessarily be identical to the pre disturbance landscape poscente and charette 2011 alberta environment 2008 as reclamation efforts in the region typically use mine waste materials i e tailing sand petroleum coke as construction substrates the trajectory and end result of reclaimed systems is likely to result in a hybrid or novel landscape these landscapes may be physically different but functionally similar to natural pre disturbance landscapes as the structural and hydrogeochemical characteristics of construction materials used in aosr reclamation endeavours are vastly different than those found in natural systems nwaishi et al 2015a daly et al 2012 the pre disturbance landscape of the aosr comprises a mosaic of upland forests 23 and wetlands 54 aep 2018 rooney et al 2012 which are largely fen peatlands daly et al 2012 chee and vitt 1989 initially reclamation endeavours in the aosr focused solely on reclaiming to upland forests however due to the extensive occurrence of peatlands their specific ecosystem services i e carbon storage and hydrologic interconnectivity between uplands and peatlands fens have begun to be integrated into regional reclamation efforts ketcheson et al 2016 due to the magnitude of disturbance reclamation endeavours require the complete reengineering of surface topography and subsurface stratigraphy in addition to the initiation of vegetation through planting campaigns reestablishment of hydrological connectivity is critical to the evolution and success of reclaimed landscapes due to water requirements of key ecohydrological and biogeochemical functions particularly in peatlands i e inundated conditions stable near surface water table daly et al 2012 elshorbagy et al 2005 ensuring adequate water for ecosystem function in the aosr is further complicated by the sub humid climate of the region where annual evapotranspiration commonly exceeds precipitation resulting in frequent periods of water stress bothe and abraham 1993 moreover this water stress is expected to worsen in the area according to climate projections thompson et al 2017 ireson et al 2015 devito et al 2012 the availability and use of water in an ecosystem is critical to successful development and function and is controlled mainly by the storage capacity of soils and vegetation rodriguez iturbe and porporato 2004 thus reclamation design in the aosr needs to ensure adequate water availability for successful ecosystem development and function while accounting for the limited water availability the overarching goal of reclamation in the region is to create functional self sustaining resilient ecosystems as such benchmarks encompassing ecologic hydrologic and industry perspectives of ecosystem performance have been defined daly et al 2012 and successful reclamation requires an ecosystem to be 1 capable of supporting a representative assemblage of species 2 carbon accumulating and 3 able to withstand periodic environmental stress as aosr fen reclamation is a relatively new endeavour quantifiable metrics for evaluating the trajectory success and long term sustainability of reclamation projects is required as it is difficult to directly measure ecosystem function through a single metric the evaluation of reclamation performance has typically relied on the measurement of a large number of ecosystem variables e g soil properties and geochemistry vegetation surveys biomass water use under the premise that in aggregate these variables will reflect ecosystem function and land capability however this approach has limitations such as data on a large number of variables can be onerous to collect and impossible to appropriately integrate variables may be poor indicators of actual function measured variables may reflect current site performance but fail to provide information on site stability under changing conditions and on broader landscape level performance alternatively a focus on fewer biologically integrative factors or on emergent properties may be more effective straker et al 2019 strilesky et al 2017 nwaishi et al 2015a ecosystem water and carbon dynamics are integrative indicators of a suite of supporting ecosystem processes and characteristics for example water use efficiency wue which links photosynthesis with water use provides a useful metric to evaluate the use of water and carbon resources by plants as such assessment of the efficiency of ecosystem water use provides important insight on resiliency to climatic variation and on landscape level water storage and yield net ecosystem exchange nee captures the net exchange i e photosynthesis and respiration of carbon between an ecosystem and the atmosphere and is a primary gauge of ecosystem carbon sink capacity the overall carbon sink capacity of an ecosystem is dependent on edaphic conditions water availability and plant community composition thus integration of ecosystem scale measurements of carbon exchange coupled with remote sensing metrics for plant development provides an efficient integrative measure of reclamation performance and early successional trajectory to date only two pilot

covariance towers remote sensing specifically the objectives were to a provide a temporal snapshot of ecosystem evolution by using plant development net ecosystem exchange nee and wue as metrics b evaluate ecosystem functionality and c provide context to nfw performance through the comparison of carbon dynamics at surrounding natural and post disturbance sites 2 study site the nikanotee fen watershed nfw is a 32 ha constructed watershed located within an oil sands mining operation approximately 30 km north of fort mcmurray alberta 56 55 944 n 111 25 035 w fig 1 nfw consists of three previously reclaimed slopes 18 7 ha an undisturbed natural slope 2 8 ha a newly reclaimed upland 7 7 ha and fen peatland 2 9 ha this study focuses only on the newly reclaimed upland and fen landscapes

abraham 1993 nfw was designed based on numerical modelling of ideal geometries and substrate materials for successful ecosystem function within the wbp climate while satisfying vegetation water requirements and facilitating peat accumulation price et al 2010 moreover the system is designed to function in a simplified but analogous manner to fen upland ecosystems common in undisturbed landscapes of the wbp where uplands supply groundwater to downgradient peatlands wells et al 2017 elmes and price 2019 as such there is no manual manipulation of the water table at nfw hydrological inputs to the system include precipitation and surface runoff from the surrounding previously reclaimed hillslopes fig 1 a and fen hydrology is dependent on the down gradient transport of water from the upland aquifer sutton and price 2020a ketcheson et al 2016 surface water is discharged through an outflow located in the northeastern corner of the fen a complete account of nfw hydrological functioning is given in ketcheson et al 2017 construction of the upland fen complex began in 2012 and concluded in january 2013 planting and revegetation were initiated in june 2013 in 2014 additional peat was added to the fen in an attempt to counter ponding and additional tamarack seedlings were planted in the upland the upland surface was subsequently modified through tillage to create furrows perpendicular to flow to limit excessive overland flow increase recharge to the upland aquifer and better facilitate development of plant rooting architecture sutton and price 2020a gingras hill et al 2018 ketcheson et al 2017 daly et al 2012 in june 2015 a subsequent upland planting campaign occurred to actualize desired stand density 10 188 additional tree and shrub saplings gingras hill et al 2018 materials used in construction included locally and readily available recovered materials from mining operations such as by products of the bitumen extraction process tailing sand petroleum coke and salvaged overburden peat and forest mineral soils from the initial clearing of natural landscapes on oil sands leases daly et al 2012 in addition to being abundantly available these recovered materials were used as they had the appropriate hydrophysical properties for recreating the requisite hydrologic connectivity price et al 2010 the constructed upland fen complex is underlain by an impermeable engineered geotextile clay liner 0 05 m thick which encourages lateral flow while limiting deep water loss to the regional water table fig 1d above the liner is a 0 5 m thick layer of tailing sand overlain by a 0 5 m thick layer of petroleum coke which extends beneath the fen and partway into the upland acting as a highly permeable underdrain to improve hydrological connectivity and more evenly distribute water and solute flows beneath the fen fig 1d simhayov et al 2017 daly et al 2012 the entire system was constructed on and due to the clay liner is hydrologically isolated from a fine textured over burden dump fig 1d in the upland 2 3 m of tailing sand creates an aquifer to support transport of water from upland to fen due to its relatively high hydraulic conductivity sutton and price 2020a however these physical properties also result in poor moisture retention which in turn impedes plant growth and development fung and macyk 2015 moreover as a by product of bitumen extraction tailing sand contains residual amounts of highly mobile solutes namely sodium na amongst other constituents simhayov et al 2017 rezanezhad et al 2012 which can affect water quality

capping layer of salvaged forest soil lfh sandy loam to loam was placed on top of the tailing sand to better promote plant growth and function by limiting the degree of solutes in the rooting zone and improving rooting zone water retention naeth et al 2013 cover soil thickness is variable throughout the upland and ranges between 20 and 50 cm thick planting prescriptions followed procedures outlined by the cumulative environmental management association revegetation manual alberta environment 2008 revegetation used native species common to wbp uplands such as black spruce picea mariana jack pine

appear to have a negligible impact on wtd position however larger or recurring rain events 2018 or prolonged dry periods 2017 influenced wtd fig 4a c edaphic conditions between the two landscapes varied significantly due to differences in substrate that affect the soil water holding capacity and the aforementioned differences in wtd fen soil temperatures varied from 4 sept 2014 to 29 c june

to remain relatively stable with only slight increases occurring during large rain events however prolonged dry periods in the fen led to a decline in moisture content in the near surface top 5 cm as exhibited in 2017 when values dropped from 85 down to 72 fig 4d during wetter years fen vwc measured at 15 cm depth was 2 6 drier than the upper near surface peat while the opposite trend emerged

the overarching goal of reclamation in the region is to create functional self sustaining resilient ecosystems as there is no singular metric or definition for ecosystem function benchmarks encompassing ecologic hydrologic and industry perspectives of ecosystem performance have been defined for nfw daly et al 2012 here successful reclamation requires an ecosystem to be 1 capable of supporting a representative assemblage of species 2 carbon accumulating and 3 able to withstand periodic environmental stress 5 1 1 capacity for supporting representative species assemblage plants play a fundamental role in nutrient carbon and water cycling as the central conduit between surface atmosphere exchanges driven by climatic and hydrological conditions brümmer et al 2012 limpens et al 2008 bubier et al 2003 particularly in peatlands plant community composition and species specific phenologies control carbon uptake through plant productivity peichl et al 2018 and quality of litter deposited ultimately affecting rates of peat formation trites and bayley 2009 specific to reclaimed aosr landscapes planting prescriptions must ensure efficient water use and ability to function under the expected range of environmental i e saline conditions during ecosystem evolution in the fen both vascular and bryophyte species were introduced through a number of planting treatments see borkenhagen and cooper 2019 by year 3 2015 fen vascular vegetation was widespread and robust consisting predominantly of carex aquatilis and to lesser extents juncus balticus typha latifolia calamagrostis inexpansa and triglochin martima a similar rapid expansion of sedge species has also been observed at a nearby reclaimed fen sandhill fen sfw clark 2018 vitt et al 2016 and several post disturbance fen landscapes in alberta including restored seismic lines davidson et al 2021 and well pads lemmer et al 2020 bryophyte establishment following moss transfer did occur at nfw but at a much lesser rate than expected likely due to the rapid expansion of sedge species due to its tolerance of saline conditions ptychostomum pseudotriquetrum has become the dominant bryophyte species occurring throughout nfw fen although other bryophyte species calliergon giganteum campylium stellatum drepanocladus aduncus drepanocladus polygamous leptobryum pyriforme are also present borkenhagen and cooper 2019 similar to nearby natural saline fens volik et al 2018 and sandhill fen watershed hartsock et al 2021 vitt et al 2016 the spatial extent of plant assemblages at nfw fen was driven largely by water table position and salinity as observed in other restored and reclaimed peatland landscapes poulin et al 2013 vitt et al 2016 typha latifolia colonized most of the ponded standing water regions of the fen widespread establishment of invasive t latifolia may be problematic for reclamation performance as it decays quickly and is not a peat forming species which may affect long term peatland function borkenhagen and cooper 2019 trites and baylay 2009 shih and finkelstein 2008 between 2014 and 2019 fen plant assemblages evolved coinciding with changes in soil and water salinity fresh water sedge and grass species in the fen such as carex aurea carex disperma and hierochloe hitra peaked in 2015 but were then rare or absent following increased levels of mobile sodium borkenhagen and cooper 2019 species with a larger range of salt tolerance such as juncus balticus calamagrostis inexpansa and triglochin martima persisted and even expanded in some plots with increased salinity in 2018 the fen experienced the highest in flux of sodium during the study period table 2 kessel et al 2018 sutton 2021 resulting in visible salt stress in carex aquatilis and typha latifolia observed yellowing in foliage and early senescence of some plots in recent years clusters of betula pumila and salix pedicellaris have developed in persistently drier regions of the fen overall the fen plant community at nfw was representative of natural saline fens in the region volik et al 2018 purdy et al 2005 chee and vitt 1989 however plant succession and trajectory towards herbaceous or more marsh like vegetation may occur and could have implications on long term carbon dynamics for this site in the future evolution of upland vegetation occurred at a much slower rate than the fen use of salvaged forest floor materials as a capping layer is common practice in forest reclamation efforts in the region rowland et al 2009 prentice 2020 irving 2020 as it supports soil water retention necessary for plant growth sutton and price 2020a and provides propagules of species common to natural boreal forests pinno and hawkes 2015 mackenzie and quideau 2010 early successional upland species at nfw were markedly different than that of other naturally regenerating forests e g post fire post harvest due to dry conditions and hydrochemistry however similar to other reclaimed uplands strilesky et al 2017 mackenzie and quideau 2010 rowland et al 2009 the initial 5 years following construction nfw upland consisted of a patchy understory comprising invasive forbs and grasses sonchus arvensis and agropyron tracycaulum and dry bare ground although counter intuitive these non native early successional species were critical to the emergence and development of planted tree species they facilitated improved soil structure through rhizosphere development as well as litter layer establishment which resulted in the addition of labile organic matter and nutrients padilla et al 2009 gómez aparicio et al 2004 maestre et al 2001 trees became prominent by year 5 2017 and consisted of both broadleaf populus tremuloides populus balsamifera and coniferous picea mariana pinus banksiana species native to the region as of 2019 the understory consisted of shrubs graminoids and forbs and trees were becoming the dominant vegetation type notably populus tremuloides was never planted in the upland however wind blown seeds were likely dispersed from the nearby previously reclaimed slopes growth and timing of development of nfw upland tree species was similar to that of other reclaimed uplands in the region strilesky et al 2017 remote sensing has been increasingly applied to peatland and post disturbance studies as a means to identify plant community development and succession following disturbance chasmer et al 2020 lees et al 2018 in this study the derivation of remotely sensed evi provided a more complete temporal and spatial record of plant emergence and development than fields methods alone once plant communities were established evi values measured at nfw were comparable to that of surrounding natural sites fig 5 and on par with other post disturbance landscapes e g restored peatland nugent et al 2018 or those composed of similar plant communities e g sedge fens schubert et al 2010 helbig et al 2019 mixed wood boreal forest jahan and gan 2011 ranging between 0 3 and 0 6 during peak season although the timing of vegetative development varied between the two landscapes planting campaigns paired with adequate edaphic conditions resulted in establishment of a diverse plant community comprising largely native species while saline fens are uncommon they do exist in the wbp and are within the scope of acceptable reclamation targets province of alberta 2020 due to the specific altered hydrochemical and physical state of the substrate materials used in reclamation e g unstratified compressed or dried peat presence of naphthenic acids mobile sodium in tailing sand nicholls et al 2016 nwaishi et al 2015b kessel et al 2018 biagi et al 2021 plant succession and system evolution may take on a transformed novel trajectory from the pre disturbance landscape nwaishi et al 2015a assigning common landscape classification to these novel ecosystems is less relevant in reclamation and of greater importance is the functionality of plant assemblages under present and future environmental conditions 5 1 2 carbon accumulation one of the key ecosystem functions performed by peatlands is net uptake of atmospheric co2 via photosynthesis and the long term storage of carbon as organic matter in peat and litter vasander and kettunen 2006 blodau 2002 gorham 1991 as nee is typically the largest component of northern peatland annual carbon budgets limpens et al 2008 nilsson et al 2008 roulet et al 2007 it was used here as a metric to quantify nfw s annual carbon function growing season results show significant progress towards ecosystem functionality from a co2 perspective the fen quickly evolved from a bare ground growing season source of co2 in 2013 to an extensively vegetated sink by 2015 243 g c m 2 moreover from 2015 onwards the fen has been sequestering co2 at rates comparable to nearby natural sites see section 5 3 while the upland was still a growing season source of co2 in 2019 46 g c m 2 there has been an increase in plant co2 uptake that is expected to continue as the canopy continues to develop as a result the nfw upland is on a trajectory towards becoming a net carbon sink in the near future 5 1 3 response to periodic environmental stress in the seven years following inception nfw has demonstrated resilience to periodic hydrologic stress as observed during wet and dry periods as well as during changes in water quality e g migration and influx of salts 5 1 3 1 resilience to hydrologic stress the wpb sub humid climate presents an additional challenge to reclamation in the region with moisture deficits and decadal dry cycles chasmer et al 2018 devito et al 2017 bothe and abraham 1993 climate change predictions for the region project an increase in both temperature and precipitation which may further exacerbate moisture deficits thompson et al 2018 ireson et al 2015 devito et al 2012 while increased precipitation will provide more water to the system increased temperatures will likely lengthen the growing season and enhance et additionally variability in the intensity frequency and amount of rainfall may have unknown effects on current ecohydrological feedbacks as such water availability and use are critical to the long term sustainability and performance of reclaimed systems in the aosr in all seven years during the study period fen et rates exceeded precipitation yet vegetation was able to grow develop and uptake co2 at rates comparable to natural sites see 5 3 below notably fen wue rates remained relatively stable fig 9 from 2015 onwards even during seasons with significantly less rainfall seasonal rainfall ranging from 168 to 285 mm season 1 stable wue is indicative of a well connected groundwater network between the upland and fen which resulted in sufficient hydrological self regulation during times of hydrologic stress additionally because fen vegetation developed significant rooting architecture 1 m depth in places messner 2019 it was able to access water even during prolonged dry periods that resulted in water table drawdown e g 2017 as a result the system had adequate plant water availability and plant function was not solely dependent on p inputs ultimately increasing resilience to future moisture deficits moreover fen wue rates once vegetation became established 2015 2019 average 1 8 1 3 g c kg h2o 1 day 1 were comparable to those observed at nearby natural fens c f 1 7 3 0 g c kg h2o 1 day 1 in volik et al 2021 currently the upland is supplying the fen with adequate water for ecohydrological functioning however it is uncertain if this will continue as the upland canopy continues to develop requiring more water and water deficits continue to worsen as trees continue to mature et rates are expected to increase strilesky et al 2017 and will likely lead to et p more frequently to date et p occurred only during dry years 2015 2017 moreover as the canopy develops more water is expected to be lost through evaporation of intercepted water resulting in less direct inputs into the soil fettah 2020 however studies of boreal aspen stands during drought conditions describe an efficient redistribution of water via aspen rooting systems petrone et al 2015 brown et al 2014 which may ensure enough water for plant function during periods of water stress in the upland furthermore sutton and price 2020a modelled the hydrologic effects of upland plant growth in nfw and concluded the system will likely be capable of providing sufficient groundwater to the fen and support the development and function of an upland forest however the system will likely be operating just within the margins of adequate water availability overall the current ecohydrological functioning of nfw is capable of adapting and coping with the climatic regime of the aosr 5 1 3 2 resilience to salt stress mitigating the effects of salinization from waste materials used in reclamation in the aosr is an ongoing challenge biagi et al 2019 kessel et al 2018 simhayov et al 2017 to date fen and upland vegetation have been able to develop and persist under current concentrations of na and electrical conductivity values table 2 however in 2018 carex aquatilis and typha latifolia exhibited signs of salt stress yellow foliage early senescence while nee in 2018 remained within the range of previous years and that of natural sites there was an observable decrease fig 6 7 table 4a and b additionally there was a decrease in biomass messner 2019 lai and evi values table 3 current hydrochemical conditions of nfw are still well within the range of levels observed at natural saline sites volik et al 2021 2019 hartsock et al 2021 esrd 2015 planting and establishment of species ranging in salt tolerance likely helped the fen continue functioning i e carbon uptake at a comparable rate to other years however prolonged exposure to saline conditions will likely result in a shift in the plant community and a decrease in carbon uptake capacity volik et al 2018 moreover a number of ecohydrological and biogeochemical processes decay rates nutrient acquisition plant water uptake etc may be affected by prolonged soil and water salinity which may ultimately affect the long term functionality of these landscapes nwaishi et al 2015a 5 2 drivers of ecosystem functionality and interannual variability results indicate that ecosystem function during the initial stages of development of a constructed reclaimed landscape is directly linked to the establishment and growth of vegetation however system design and construction are critical first steps as appropriate abiotic conditions such as substrate quality and water availability are required to initiate vegetation growth and persistence studies of boreal watersheds natural restored and constructed indicate that water table dynamics nutrient availability and hydrochemistry play a critical role in determining plant community composition volik et al 2020a borkenhagen and cooper 2019 spennato et al 2018 vitt et al 2016 dieleman et al 2015 koropchak et al 2012 trites and bayley 2009 eppinga et al 2009a strack et al 2006 lavoie et al 2005 the relatively quick initiation of a widespread and robust sedge community in the fen was likely facilitated by planting and initial growth occurring in relatively wet years 2013 2014 fig 3 a as well as the relatively quick initiation of stable near surface water table conditions following construction fig 4c in reclaimed aosr uplands growth and persistence of plants is driven by available soil moisture which is facilitated largely by cover soil composition and thickness sutton and price 2020a gingras hill et al 2018 spatial variability in the timing of plant emergence in the nfw upland fig 5a was linked to the heterogeneity of soil conditions i e moisture and nutrient availability soil moisture and capping layer thickness maps created by sutton and price 2020a of nfw correspond strongly to evi imagery presented in this study fig 5a particularly during early development 2014 2016 where areas of thicker capping materials 30 cm and in turn higher vwc promoted earlier plant establishment and more consistent robust growth 5 2 1 interannual variability of carbon fluxes results from peatland restoration strack et al 2014 strack and zuback 2013 samaritani et al 2011 waddington et al 2010 petrone et al 2001 and post disturbance afforestation efforts strilesky et al 2017 dhar et al 2018 petrone et al 2015 mkhabela et al 2009 indicate revegetation activities greatly reduce carbon losses and can return degraded ecosystems to carbon sinks over time in both nfw landscapes carbon uptake improved substantially with development of vegetation fig 7 table 4 in established plant communities seasonal variability in carbon fluxes is largely controlled by plant physiology growing season length par and meteorological conditions baldocchi et al 2018 charman et al 2013 brümmer et al 2012 barr et al 2007 falge et al 2002 law et al 2002 bubier et al 1998 examination of interannual variability in carbon fluxes in years following plant establishment fen 2015 2019 fig 6 and 7 suggests a response to environmental changes notably in 2017 the fen received only 61 mm of rainfall between july september compared to 154 mm in 2018 and 208 mm in 2019 resulting in a decrease in water table position and vwc fig 3 as such there was a decrease in daily gep rates and nee fig 6a 7 a in 2017 during this dry period compared to wetter years e g 2018 and 2019 however it s important to note that carbon uptake continued during this time albeit at a lesser rate likely due to stomatal closure to limit water loss daily gep rates during the 2017 dry period 3 6 1 4 g c m 2 day 1 were comparable to those of nearby within 40 km natural sites in the region experiencing similar meteorological conditions at the time daily gep between 1 5 and 4 1 g c m 2 day 1 volik et al 2021 moreover a similar gep decrease under warming or drying conditions has been reported in rich fens adkinson et al 2011 and sedge dominated microforms in a poor fen strack et al 2006 however other studies in open treed fens have shown contradictory results where gep increased under warming or drying conditions flanagan et al 2010 cai et al 2010 moreover bryophyte dominated microforms showed less response to changing conditions strack et al 2006 thus the response of gep in peatlands to changing environmental conditions is complex non linear and likely controlled by site specific variables i e plant community and edaphic conditions and the overall amplitude of change semeraro et al 2019 moreover the timing and frequency of rain events produced interseasonal variability in carbon fluxes in 2018 rainfall events were intense but less frequent including 28 days with no rain between doy 206 234 fig 2 table 2 which contrasted with 2019 where there was weekly and for some parts of the season daily smaller rainfall events as a result there was variability between the two years in the number of overcast days which limited par and ultimately plant productivity as such 2018 exhibited higher daily gep rates than 2019 fig 6 even though both years received a similar amount of total precipitation in particular there was a clear decrease in co2 uptake in the afternoon hours of 2019 fig 7 due to lower par and overcast conditions compared to the same time of year in 2017 and 2018 similarly nijp et al 2015 examined the effects of daytime rain events on nee during an 11 year study in northern sweden and found that reduced light availability due to cloud cover during rain events reduced net ecosystem co2 uptake on average by 0 23 0 54 g c m 2 day 1 or 4 4 decrease in gep throughout a growing season growing season length coupled with the timing of plant emergence also affects seasonal carbon fluxes charman et al 2013 there was a distinct temporal trend in the timing of plant emergence throughout fen evolution in earlier years 2015 plant emergence green up and subsequent carbon uptake occurred quickly by doy 136 fig 7 due to low plant competition adequate edaphic conditions and little to no litter layer from 2017 onwards a delay in plant emergence was observed with daily carbon uptake beginning later each year doy 146 150 160 for 2017 2018 2019 this delay is likely attributed to persistence of winter conditions and ice lenses pulliainen et al 2017 charman et al 2013 aurela et al 2004 and accumulation of a relatively thick litter layer mean litter layer thickness 12 6 2 cm 2017 and 17 8 9 5 2019 table 3 resulting in new growth requiring more energy and time to emerge moreover there was variability in the timing of plant emergence and thus plant productivity and co2 sequestration between the fen and upland figure 7ab timing of nee signal 2017 2019 due to differences in plant community composition 5 2 2 interannual variability in et nfw et was strongly coupled to water availability and development of vegetation as was previously noted at nfw scarlett et al 2017 and related boreal studies brown et al 2010 petrone et al 2001 price et al 1998 lafleur 1990 early in its development 2013 2014 the fen surface was bare and dominated by dark wet peat and large ponded areas fig 1 as a result et was high 326 and 424 mm growing season 1 and close to pet here et rates were largely driven by high surface evaporation similar to those measured off a boreal pond petrone et al 2007 as vegetation developed and became widespread ponded and bare regions were reduced and et rates were subsequently driven by plant transpiration 2015 onwards fen et began to decrease and stabilize as vegetation became established and fully developed fig 8 furthermore similar to the straw mulch technique used in peatland restoration petrone et al 2004 rochefort 2000 price et al 1998 development of a thick fen litter layer was likely limiting large fluctuations in surface soil temperatures and impeding surface evaporative losses 2017 onwards the slight increase in fen et in 2018 was attributed to the large intense rain fall event 86 mm over 4 days fig 3 a which resulted in extensive flooding and an increase in surface evaporation while 2018 and 2019 were both wetter years total growing season rainfalls of 278 and 285 mm the frequency and intensity of events differed 2018 had less frequent more intense events whereas 2019 consisted of frequent small rain events differences in et trends between these two years were a clear example of how changes in intensity timing and frequency of rainfall can impact ecohydrological dynamics upland et rates increased from 2017 onwards as trees matured five years post construction and planting fig 8 strilesky et al 2017 reported an increase in et by 62 as tree cover became established within the first ten years of a nearby reclaimed forest amiro et al 2006a 2006b describe a similar increase in et coinciding with growth of regenerating boreal forests post wildfire drivers of ecosystem functionality varied during development initially abiotic factors such as soil and water chemistry availability of water and nutrients and adequate substrate quality paired with climatic conditions dictated the timing growth success and type of plant community development once a plant community became established plant physiology and phenology drove early carbon and water fluxes notably successful development of these early plant communities is likely to dictate future trajectories and overall success of the system as these early plant communities initiate and control key ecohydrological and biogeochemical feedbacks i e nutrient input litter quality decay rate carbon uptake necessary for ecosystem function once vegetation was well established interannual fluctuations in carbon and water fluxes were once again driven by environmental factors similar to natural ecosystems nfw was able to continue functioning through interannual fluctuations in environmental conditions see 5 1 3 response to periodic stress however prolonged environmental stressors may lead to a plant successional shift scheffer 2010 eppinga et al 2009 in the future at which point carbon and water fluxes would again be largely impacted by changes in plant form and function 5 3 comparison of nfw net ecosystem exchange rates to natural and post disturbance landscapes to contextualize the results and performance of nfw nee results were compared to natural and post disturbance aosr peatlands and forests fig 10 summarises total growing season nee versus age following disturbance while providing a mean range of values recorded at natural sites blue band following plant emergence 2014 the nfw fen has remained a co2 sink throughout the study period with growing season nee ranging between 69 to 215 g c m 2 table 4 currently only two upland wetland pilot ecosystems this study nikanotee fen watershed nfw and sandhill fen watershed sfw have been constructed to test the design and feasibility of reclamation projects in the region the two systems were guided by different conceptual approaches and test differing designs ketcheson et al 2016 briefly nfw utilized numerical modelling for landscape optimization while sfw was designed to mimic the water conserving function of natural fen systems based on their low lying landscape position both systems were constructed using similar materials i e by products of the bitumen extraction process albeit at variable thicknesses e g peat thickness of 2 m at nfw vs 0 5 m at sfw and included planting campaigns a notable difference between the two systems is water transport and storage in an attempt to combat the frequent periods of water stress common to the region and ensure ample inundated conditions for fen evolution sfw was built with pumps to allow for the active management of water inputs and withdrawals as such the system has no natural outflow for surface and near surface water ketcheson et al 2016 biagi et al 2021 contrastingly there is no manual water table manipulation at nfw fen groundwater inputs are solely supplied from the upgradient upland and water is discharged gravitational through a natural flowing outlet remarkably these two reclaimed peatlands follow a similar carbon trajectory despite differences in conceptual designs and water management techniques clark 2018 ketcheson et al 2016 likely due to the rapid initiation of plant growth immediately following construction at both sites the peatlands become growing season co2 sinks within 3 years following construction at uptake rates comparable to nearby natural sites fig 10 a clark 2018 report a growing season net co2 uptake of 194 g c m 2 and 112 g c m 2 in the lowland and midland of sfw by year 3 fig 10 a natural fens across the boreal exhibit a wide range of nee values both between sites and interannually within a single site attributed to differences in plant community composition edaphic conditions and responses to hydrological dynamics and meteorological influences volik et al 2021 loisel and yu 2013 charman et al 2013 gažovič et al 2013 adkinson et al 2011 lund et al 2010 strack et al 2006 a variety of natural nearby within 40 km of nfw fens have been concurrently monitored during the study period including a moderately treed poor fen pauciflora fen heavily treed moderate rich fen poplar fen and a saline fen system saline fen growing season nee values for these nearby natural sites pauciflora poplar and saline ranged between 92 to 196 g c m 2 pauciflora 25 to 207 g c m 2 poplar and 89 to 54 g c m 2 saline volik et al 2021 here variability between sites is attributed largely to differences in plant community treed with moss vs sedge and hydrochemistry with the saline site exhibiting lower rates of gep due to salinity inhibiting plant productivity volik et al 2021 similarly morison et al 2020 report nee values of 25 and 130 g c m 2 in a two year study of an undisturbed poor fen in north central alberta within this time frame 2013 2014 adkinson et al 2011 also report interannual variability in nee in a sedge dominated extreme rich fen in northern alberta 35 154 42 g c m 2 while nee from a nearby moss dominated poor fen was similar across the study period 110 1 0 5 g c m 2 further depicting the range of plant communities found in the region and their varying responses to fluctuating environmental conditions typically vascular vegetation is more sensitive to environmental changes such as wt drawdown than mosses due to the high water holding capacity of moss kokkonen et al 2019 laine et al 2021 cai et al 2010 measured june september nee in an alberta treed fen over two years and reported higher values of 282 and 207 g c m 2 likely attributed to the prominent robust mature woody vegetation nfw fen growing season nee falls well within the range of values reported at natural undisturbed sites fig 10 a while peatland reclamation is a novel concept peatland restoration is not and numerous ongoing peatland restoration endeavours provide suitable analogies of ecosystem recovery results from both nfw and sfw depict the importance of plant community development and emergence on ecosystem function and evolution initially following construction prior to plant emergence both nfw and sfw functioned as carbon sources 70 nfw 112 sfw lowland 96 sfw midland g c m 2 waddington et al 2010 measured nee in a cutover bog in quebec bois de bel pre and post restoration and reported a seasonal net co2 loss of 245 g c m 2 prior to restoration petrone et al 2003 reported on the first two years post restoration of the aforementioned site at which point co2 emissions remained high 478 and 468 g c m 2 due to the lack of a complete cover of carbon fixing vegetation and high respiration rates from decomposing mulch similarly high co2 losses were observed during the initial year of study at adjacent restored and unrestored peatlands 445 504 g c m 2 nugent et al 2019 in northern alberta furthermore rankin et al 2018 reports that an unrestored peatland continues to function as a net co2 source 173 and 259 g c m 2 15 and 16 years post disturbance moreover timing of the return to carbon sink capacity varies amongst post disturbance sites and has been observed by year 3 in a restored cut away peatland tuittila et al 1999 and year 14 at bois de bel nugent et al 2018 strack and zuback 2013 measured co2 fluxes at bois de bel ten years following restoration however the system was still functioning as a carbon source due to wt drawdown and drier conditions resulting in increased rates of respiration differences in the rate and timing of carbon uptake in post disturbance landscapes is largely driven by vegetation dynamics i e vegetation emergence and establishment plant community composition and environmental conditions particularly edaphic conditions where dry conditions exacerbate respiration rapid emergence of wide spread vascular vegetation stable edaphic conditions and development of a thick litter layer resulted in gep rates continually exceeding respiration at nfw fen resulting in a return to carbon sink capacity comparable to natural and restored sites natural saline fen volik et al 2021 and restored strack and zuback 2013 peatlands exhibit periods of seasonal or short term carbon losses typically prompted by changes in water availability or hydrochemistry which can each inhibit plant productivity as of 2019 nfw fen has shown resilience to environmental stressors and is expected to continue functioning in terms of carbon uptake like natural sites barring any major successional shifts in vegetation although there have been numerous studies assessing upland reclamation treatment materials mackenzie and quideau 2010 naeth et al 2013 pinno and hawkes 2015 and soil structure and function sutton and price 2020b gingras hill et al 2018 dietrich mackenzie 2018 rowland et al 2009 there have been limited long term studies of carbon and water dynamics of aosr reclaimed uplands straker et al 2019 strilesky et al 2017 moreover mature stand dynamics can vary from that of juvenile or regenerating forest systems goulden et al 2011 as such here post disturbance i e fire harvest regenerating boreal forests are discussed to provide context of early results and trajectory of our nfw upland upland wbp forests range from broadleaf leaf aspen dominated to coniferous forests comprised of black spruce jack pine and tamaracks and less frequently mixed forest comprised of both tree types forest type is a key driver of carbon dynamics as broadleaf forests typically have higher leaf area gep and ultimately co2 uptake than coniferous species brümmer et al 2012 of the seven mature 40 years old forests summarised in fig 10b broad leaf forests had the highest mean growing season uptake 182 104 g c m 2 followed by mixed tree stands 73 57 g c m 2 and coniferous stands 7 40 g c m 2 fig 10b as of 2019 year 7 nfw upland was still a source of co2 emitting 46 g c m 2 however it is on a trajectory to becoming a carbon sink in the next 3 5 years which is on par with the assessments of carbon dynamics in regenerating forests for example amiro et al 2010 2006a examined a number of mature post harvest and post fire forests across boreal regions of north america and reported that most sites became carbon sinks ten years following disturbance goulden et al 2011 examined co2 exchanges in stands ranging in age from 1 to 154 years post disturbance and found a similar temporal trend where 1 to 6 year old sites were losing carbon emitting between 11 and 192 g c m 2 15 year old sites were beginning to gain carbon 21 to 32 g c m 2 sequestered and any sites over 25 were sequestering carbon 40 to 110 g c m 2 at rates comparable to mature natural sites the lag in carbon sequestration rates in juvenile forests is attributed to the small stature and low lai of saplings as well as respiration losses from bare forest floor previously reclaimed uplands in the aosr south bison hill and cell11a on fig 10b exhibited an increase in co2 uptake almost immediately following planting due to the emergence and rapid expansion of understory vegetation once trees mature these uplands perform on par or better than mature forests mean total seasonal nee of 216 g c m 2 for a mixed forest and 107 g c m 2 for a jack pine dominated landscape straker et al 2019 similar to aosr wetlands forest carbon function is sensitive to environmental changes particularly hydrologic stress petrone et al 2015 examined two regenerating aspen dominated stands and reported a return to carbon sink function by year 3 from 425 to 17 g c m 2 between years 1 3 followed by subsequent co2 losses in years 4 5 201 and 180 g c m 2 due to the persistence of drought like conditions a significant increase in tree growth and foliage in the nfw upland from 2017 onwards resulted in a marked increase in gep and overall co2 uptake however due to the sparse understory and rather dry edaphic conditions respiration rates remained high throughout the study period this was in contrast to juvenile post fire sites where respiration rates are typically lower in the initial years following fire as burnt soil and fire residue take longer to decompose czimczik et al 2006 litvak et al 2003 nevertheless as the canopy continues to mature gep is expected to increase and eventually overtake respiration as the dominant carbon flux at our upland site currently the upland is following a similar trajectory to other regenerating forested systems and is expected to regain function as a carbon sink within the next 3 5 years 6 conclusions this study captured what was likely the most dynamic period of nfw evolution characterized by the rapid transition from a barren landscape to a flourishing ecosystem comparable to natural analogues in the region beginning in the first year post construction to the present the system experienced rapid growth and establishment of vegetation by 2015 in the fen and 2017 in the upland and changing hydrochemical conditions results indicate ecosystem functionality namely carbon and water fluxes were largely controlled by plant growth and establishment the fen quickly evolved from a carbon source in 2013 to a stable carbon sink by 2015 total seasonal nee of 70 to 243 g c m 2 the slower growth rate of trees coupled with dry edaphic conditions in the upland resulted in net carbon losses during the study period nee of 519 46 g c m 2 from 2013 to 2019 similarly wue rates in both the fen and upland showed a marked increase once vegetation became established moreover plant function and carbon uptake were able to persist throughout dry years indicating sufficient hydrological connectivity between the two landscapes and ecosystem resilience to intervals of periodic water stress interannual variability of fluxes suggested that plant communities are exhibiting typical responses to environmental changes as these responses mirror those of natural sites in the surrounding area experiencing similar conditions barring a successional shift caused by prolonged saline or dry conditions water and carbon fluxes of both landscapes are expected to stabilize and future fluctuations are predicted to be controlled by meteorological influences assessment of co2 and water exchanges provided sufficient evidence that the system is currently operating as intended and functioning comparably to undisturbed landscapes fen or post disturbance landscapes of a similar age and plant community upland persistent saline conditions will likely result in a shift to more salt tolerant species in the future which may decrease rates of plant productivity and carbon sequestration while it is difficult to definitively predict future abiotic conditions and thus ecosystem trajectories the fen will likely evolve towards a plant community and ecosystem functionality similar to that of fens in the region the upland will likely be capable of supporting a forest of similar density to undisturbed sites and continue supplying adequate water to the down gradient fen a limitation of this research is that nfw is a pilot project and thus the only current example of this design as such it may not reflect the only successional path of future reclamation endeavours particularly if designs are adjusted or baseline environmental conditions change thus as future reclamation endeavours are initiated carbon and water fluxes along with plant development should continue to be monitored to improve our knowledge base moreover as the nfw is still in a juvenile phase and hydrochemistry is expected to continue changing future work should include continued monitoring particularly if there is a shift in plant communities lastly as this study only focused on co2 fluxes future work should include a complete carbon balance for the site to accurately assess carbon accumulation and storage this study is currently the longest reported record of carbon and water dynamics of a reclaimed upland fen complex in the aosr assessment of ecohydrological dynamics during early development suggests that the constructed system is evolving towards becoming a self sustaining carbon accumulating functional ecosystem this study demonstrates that fen reclamation is possible and can be successful in the aosr moreover this study applied a functional based approach focused on a few critical ecohydrological variables co2 and wue measured using ecosystem scale techniques eddy covariance and remote sensing analysis the methods used here provide a feasible approach for capturing temporal ecosystem evolution and functionality following construction and could prove useful especially for large scale or remote reclamation endeavours where field work is not possible this research provides a unique opportunity to assess surface atmosphere interactions during the early successional stage of ecosystem development ultimately improving our understanding of ecohydrological processes ecohydrological insights gained from this study on the function and evolution of constructed landscapes will aid reclamation practitioners regulatory decision makers and mine operators in the future design of reclamation endeavours in the region moreover the rapid return of carbon sink capacity illustrated in this study paired with the ability for ecosystem functionality to persist in the water limited setting of the aosr may prove useful outside of the realm of reclamation as

from new and existing wells and assessments of potential vertical head gradients and pathways between oil and groundwater zones may yield additional insight keywords groundwater quality near oil fields salinity tracers thermogenic hydrocarbon gas multiple lines of evidence 1 introduction efforts to assess the potential effects on groundwater quality from gas and water associated with hydrocarbon production activities have increased with recent oil and gas drilling activities throughout the united states brantley et al 2014 vengosh et al 2014 digiulio and jackson 2016 the degradation of shallow groundwater quality from saline water derived from oil and gas production activities has been the focus of some studies warner et al 2012 2013 mcmahon et al 2015 groundwater quality may also be affected by natural sources of saline water and hydrocarbon gas from oil and gas shows in aquifer sediments overlying the hydrocarbon production zone warner et al 2012 flewelling and sharma 2014 siegel et al 2015a 2015b engle et al 2016 harkness et al 2017 many studies have focused on determining the sources of methane and other hydrocarbon gases observed in shallow groundwater in areas of oil and gas production osborn and mcintosh 2010 hunt et al 2012 jackson et al 2013a molofsky et al 2013 sherwood et al 2016a and 2016b woda et al 2018 microbial or biogenic gas which is almost entirely composed of methane 99 mol although minor amounts of microbial ethane 0 1 mol have been detected in some settings taylor et al 2000 is produced by methanogenic microorganisms

gooddy 2006 schloemer et al 2016 mcmahon et al 2017a lackner et al 2018 alternatively some groundwater in aquifer systems near active oil and gas development activities can also contain methane and heavier hydrocarbon gases from the underlying oil bearing formations or associated geologic natural gas shows accumulating in overlying aquifers jackson et al 2013a darrah et al 2014 mcmahon et al 2018b wen et al 2018 kreuzer et al 2018 hydrocarbon gases in many of those oil bearing formations are produced by abiotic processes at relatively high temperatures thermogenic gas and are enriched in heavier hydrocarbon gases ethane propane butane and pentane compared to microbial gas schoell 1980 whiticar 1999 although produced at depth thermogenic methane can migrate into shallow aquifers

wright et al 2019 gillespie et al 2019 rosecrans et al 2021 while others have characterized the chemistry of produced water or casing gas from oil fields mcmahon et al 2018a tyne et al 2021 for example the study of the fruitvale oil field near bakersfield determined that groundwater quality was primarily influenced by high rates of recharge from the kern river with only trace detections of water and thermogenic gas from oil bearing formations potentially including that from producing and non producing oil bearing formations in a few wells wright et al 2019 in the study of the oxnard oil field in ventura county an oil and gas production area not dominated by high regional freshwater recharge the highest concentrations of thermogenic gas in groundwater were observed in proximity to relatively high density of oil wells large injection volumes of water disposal and cyclic steam shallow oil development and hydrocarbon shows in sediments overlying the producing oil reservoirs rosecrans et al 2021 the california state water resources control board state water board has implemented a regional groundwater monitoring program in cooperation with the u s geological survey usgs to address concerns about groundwater quality in regions of oil and gas development activities the oil and gas regional monitoring program rmp was authorized by california senate bill 4 sb 4 statutes of 2013 and includes assessment of potential impacts to groundwater quality associated with well stimulation hydraulic fracturing enhanced recovery injection water and steam flooding and production in oil producing formations and produced water disposal in injection wells and surface ponds california state water resources control board 2019 the rmp is designed to 1 assess the location of groundwater resources with 10 000 mg l total dissolved solids in proximity to oil and gas fields 2 assess evidence for the presence absence of water and or thermogenic gas from oil bearing formations mixed with groundwater and if present identify potential pathways or processes that may be responsible and 3 determine how oil and gas sources have affected groundwater quality relative to other processes u s geological survey 2019b california state water resources control board 2019 the orcutt oil field located in santa barbara county california and one of several oil fields in the onshore santa maria basin is the first oil field in this basin to be studied as part of the rmp the orcutt oil field has a longer history of oil field development then most other oil fields in california california department of conservation 1992 beginning in 1901 after the discovery of surface occurrences of hydrocarbons from petroleum saturated fissures and exposed oil bearing sands and shales in upland areas of the field early conventional development was followed by more than a half century of use of enhanced recovery practices including injection of water and steam california department of conservation 1992 furthermore groundwater resources used intensively for drinking water and irrigation are located in the adjacent san antonio creek and santa maria river valleys and not directly overlying the oil field as has been the case in other recently studied oil field settings wright et al 2019 rosecrans et al 2021 the combination of naturally occurring shallow oil and gas resources and century long oil field development in lateral proximity to used groundwater resources makes this a relevant setting for evaluating relations of groundwater quality to oil and gas sources not previously studied as part of the rmp davis et al 2018 this study uses multiple lines of evidence including the local hydrogeologic setting the geologic structure of the santa maria basin oil field development and production injection information and geochemical end member analyses to 1 determine if water and thermogenic gas from oil bearing formations occur in groundwater overlying and adjacent to the orcutt oil field and 2 explore possible pathways for these occurrences to achieve these goals a wide array of newly collected chemical isotopic dissolved gas and age dating tracers and historical water chemistry data from groundwater and oil wells were analyzed in conjunction with potential explanatory factors a conceptual schematic of the oil and gas terminology fig s1 and glossary used in this work is provided in the supplementary information 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the study area boundary is a 5 kilometer km buffer around the administrative boundary of the orcutt oil field which is located in the solomon hills south of the unincorporated town of orcutt in santa barbara county fig 1 the orcutt oil field is approximately bounded by the foothills of california s south coast ranges to the east and west the trough of the santa maria valley to the north and the san antonio creek valley to the south the region has a mediterranean climate with cool and rainy winters and dry summers during which the heat is greatly diminished by fog and northwesterly winds from the cold water of the pacific ocean which is about 24 km west of the field average annual precipitation ranges from 33 to 48 centimeters cm with a typical rainy season lasting from around november to april california department of water resources 2003 regional groundwater flow in the study area is generally westward toward the pacific ocean california dwr 2003 contours of the elevation of the water table indicate groundwater flows to the southwest into the san antonio creek valley groundwater basin hutchinson 1980 and northwest into the santa maria river valley groundwater basin hughes 1977 from the oil field which straddles the two groundwater basins fig s2 previous water quality studies have noted irrigation return flow upward migration of deep groundwater natural occurring water rock interaction lateral seepage from the surrounding outcrops of marine rocks and point sources of discharge of wastewater from oil refineries and domestic wastewater treatment facilities in the city of santa maria can affect groundwater salinity in the region although not all of these sources occur within 5 km of the orcutt oil field worts 1951 muir 1964 hughes 1977 hutchinson 1980 a more detailed description of the hydrogeologic setting is provided in the supplementary information 2 2 orcutt oil field the orcutt oil field with an area of almost 44 5 km2 is one of several oil fields in the onshore santa maria basin discovered in 1901 the proven productive area of the orcutt oil field is approximately 17 1 km2 or 38 4 of the total area california department of conservation 1992 although the area of the orcutt oil field is relatively small it represents a setting with intensive oil and gas development in upland areas adjacent to downslope groundwater aquifers used for drinking and irrigation supply that is common in many other coastal and inland groundwater basins of california davis et al 2018 planert and williams 1995 and other tectonically active areas of the world schenk et al 2012 where oil fields often occur in uplands adjacent to basin aquifers the stratigraphy of the santa maria basin in the area of the orcutt oil field is composed of lower miocene and younger tertiary formations through quaternary sedimentary rocks that lie above the regional unconformity associated with the late eocene to early oligocene ynezian orogeny namson and davis 1990 sweetkind et al 2010 fig s3 a more detailed description of the stratigraphy of the santa maria basin is provided in the supplementary information the monterey formation rich in organic matter is the principal source of oil in the santa maria basin with most production from depths between 600 and 1200 m isaacs and rullkötter 2001 petroleum traps within the santa maria basin are of two major types structural anticlinal and stratigraphic overlap truncation or sandstone pitchout isaacs 1992 oil in the orcutt oil field is trapped in a faulted asymmetrical anticline with a broad flat crest gently dipping south limb and steeply dipping or overturned north limb namson and davis 1990 fig s3 the north limb of the anticline is cut by the steeply dipping orcutt fault a reverse fault that offsets miocene and lower pliocene strata 600 1525 m from the crest of the anticline to the downthrown northern footwall fig 2 s3 in the orcutt oil field the monterey formation produces oil with low to moderate gravity whereas shallower pools have generally heavier oil isaacs and rullkötter 2001 peak oil production occurred in 1908 production began to slow as early as the 1920s and waterflooding to enhance oil recovery began in 1951 diatomite and sx zones of the sisquoc formation have been developed for oil production over approximately the last 15 years when the diatomite cyclic steam pilot program provided the necessary information to determine the commercial viability of these oil deposits using thermal cyclic steam technology developed for similar formations in the san joaquin valley california department of conservation 1992 pacific coast energy company 2017 during 1977 2017 the cumulative production volumes for the orcutt oil field were about 1060 mmbbl 106 barrels of produced water and 38 1 mmbbl of oil california department of conservation 2020a in this work produced water is defined as water withdrawn from an oil well and brought to the surface and may include oil water and gas from the geologic formation and water and or gas injected for enhanced recovery see the glossary of terms provided in the supplementary information cumulative water injection volumes for enhanced oil recovery eor between 1977 and 2017 were about 1004 mmbbl into the monterey formation with smaller injection volumes 15 6 mmbbl into the shallower diatomite and sx units of the sisquoc formation table s1 during the same 40 yr period injection volumes for produced water disposal were about 68 3 mmbbl into the monterey formation and 1 3 mmbbl into the deeper point sal and lospe formations table s1 enhanced oil recovery in the orcutt oil field has typically been accomplished by water flooding although due to the increased use of cyclic steam injection the shallower diatomite and sx units have become more targeted zones for oil recovery where present fig 2 in 2016 the orcutt oil field contained 455 new active or idle oil wells and 257 plugged and abandoned wells mostly in the northern part of the field spud or construction dates are available for 635 oil wells fig 2 s4 california department of conservation 2020a b c the majority of wells in the oil field were installed before 1976 62 although recent activity targeting the shallower diatomite and sx units in the newlove hill area has resulted in the recent construction of many more oil wells in contrast well plugging and abandonment saw little activity from about 1930 to the present day suggesting oil wells constructed many years ago still exist in the oil field fig s4 state requirements for cementing wellbores during installation and abandoning oil wells have become more rigorous over time including statewide regulations to protect useable groundwater in 1976 california department of conservation 2019 although the timing of implementation of oil well construction practices to protect groundwater in the orcutt oil field could differ from those statewide the history of changes in well construction practices in this specific field was not apparent from available records therefore 1976 was used as an approximate date for classifying oil wells into older and newer periods of construction california dept of conservation 2019 older wells may generally be more likely to have unsealed boreholes and or leaky casings that have the potential to facilitate the movement of water and gas between oil bearing formations and overlying groundwater additional discussion on oil well construction activity in the orcutt oil field is provided in the supplementary information 2 2 1 oil and gas shows surface outcrops or shallow oil sands and seeps many of which are up dip or lie above some of the largest oil and gas fields in california have been known for thousands of years heizer 1940 mulqueen 2007 there are numerous occurrences of tar sands asphalt dikes oil impregnated sandstone surficial oil sand deposits and oil and thermogenic gas detected during drilling in shallow sediments oil and gas shows in the sisquoc and careaga formations in the area of the orcutt oil field hein 2013 arnold and anderson 1907 noted the presence of asphalt deposits across graciosa ridge as a surface indication for the presence of oil in appreciable quantities in the region although there is no recorded history of natural seepage in other areas of the orcutt oil field newlove hill fig 1 has historically had many naturally occurring oil seeps leck 1921 field operators observe 2 4 new seeps per year in this area marine research specialists 2016 the presence of oil and gas shows in aquifer sediments overlying oil producing zones at some locations in the study area may indicate that upward movement of oil gas and perhaps water from deep formations occurred in response to natural hydrocarbon migration over geologic time hornafius et al 1999 quigley et al 1999 leifer 2010 oil seeps releases of crude oil formed by low energy non eruptive leakages of oil and gas to the ground surface from accumulations in the sisquoc and careaga formations can result from either natural occurring forces plate tectonics or the heating cooling and imbalance of injection fluids into the shallow diatomite unit of the sisquoc formation pacific coast energy company 2017 additional description of oil and gas shows is provided in the supplementary information mud logs allow for the identification of oil shows or detections and concentration measurements ppm of light hydrocarbon gas methane through pentane during the drilling process and are reported as vertical profiles of observations with depth for selected oil wells and depth intervals analysis of 33 available mud logs from oil wells indicate oil and gas shows occur in sediments in some areas overlying producing zones where commercial oil extraction occurs in the orcutt oil field see section 2 3 2 2 3 compilation of existing data during 2017 2019 the usgs compiled and analyzed information for the orcutt oil field and surrounding area the information included available groundwater and produced water chemistry data water and oil well construction and geophysical records oil field development history and injection data and hydrogeologic information such as regional groundwater flow directions oil companies were invited to share relevant information for inclusion in the study usgs scientists also consulted with california geologic energy management division calgem staff familiar with the oil field the goal of these compilation efforts and consultations was to obtain the most complete record of information possible 2 3 1 historical water chemistry data water chemistry data were compiled for a limited available set of analytes from 27 groundwater sites sampled in 2017 for a study investigating water availability in the san antonio creek valley groundwater basin u s geological survey 2020 and 121 sites with groundwater data collected between 1927 and 2016 and are referred to as historical groundwater chemistry data hereinafter fig 1 the historical groundwater chemistry data came from the usgs national water information system u s geological survey 2018a the california state water resources control board division of drinking water database california state water resources control board 2018 and the california department of water resources california department of water resources 2018 historical produced water chemistry data for inorganic constituents from a compilation of available oil field water sample data from 1971 to 2016 median date 1993 were used in the analysis blondes et al 2018 metzger and herrera 2020 2 3 2 attribution of wells with potential explanatory factors data were compiled for three major categories of potential explanatory factors 1 oil field development density and proximity 2 hydrogeologic variables and 3 presumed natural geologic distribution of oil and gas shows observations in the subsurface from available oil well mud logs the 15 groundwater wells sampled for the rmp see section 2 4 were attributed with potential oil development explanatory factors assembled from available information potential explanatory factors representing oil field development density and proximity describe the distance and characteristics of the nearest oil well and the number status type year drilled and the 1977 2017 vol of oil and water produced and water injected for enhanced recovery and produced water disposal for oil wells within a 500 m radius table s2 also attributed were oil well cement seals and plugs potential well integrity issues casing damage or collapse leaks and surface expressions and reported depth to base of freshwater within 500 m of sampled water wells table s3 the data were extracted from well reports and databases available from the california department of conservation 2020a b the 500 m radius was selected to provide a consistent basis for comparing the relative abundance of various factors in proximity to sampled wells and has been previously used in studies of regional groundwater quality johnson and belitz 2009 although the actual radius around a sampled well in which potential sources could influence groundwater quality is unknown and could vary by site the data available for direct comparison of water chemistry and potential oil development variables were limited because only 2 of the 15 wells sampled or 2 3 were located within the oil field boundary and in proximity to active oil development 5 sampled water wells had 15 oil wells located within the 500 m radius fig s5 table s3 away from the limited locations with groundwater sample data within the orcutt oil field the spatial distribution of factors that have the potential to affect risk to groundwater are discussed generally based on the distribution of oil wells well ages and injection volumes hydrogeologic variables evaluated included the conceptual position of sampled wells along regional groundwater flow directions based on the regional groundwater elevation contours in the san antonio creek valley and santa maria river valley groundwater basins fig s2 well perforation depths and well type see section 2 4 the distribution of oil shows and light hydrocarbon gas with depth in the aquifers overlying the oil production zones was compiled from 33 available mud logs located within the orcutt oil field boundary california department of conservation 2020b mud logging also known as hydrocarbon well logging entails gathering qualitative and semi quantitative data from hydrocarbon gas detectors that record the level of natural gas brought up in the drilling mud combined with oil field gas chromatograph instruments that determine the individual gas components most commonly methane ethane propane butane and pentane crain 2010 the recorded concentration of gas in mud logs do not represent the actual quantity of oil or gas in the sediments crain 2010 but rather the gas detected in the drilling mud with respect to depth oil shows as a percent of mud log cuttings are determined by hydrocarbon fluorescence a method in which hydrocarbons in cuttings are examined under ultraviolet light with a reagent that can indicate the presence of oil swanson 1981 in this work a list of mud logs in the orcutt oil field table s6 and recorded occurrence of the shallowest c3 c5 hydrocarbon gas and oil show were used to evaluate the presence or absence of light hydrocarbons and depths for which the hydrocarbon gas were observed relative to first appearance of trace amounts of oil oil shows relations of water chemistry to these factors and potential shallow geologic sources of hydrocarbons indicated by mud logs are discussed later in this manuscript 2 4 well selection procedure and type of wells sampled wells were selected for sampling for this study by using a geochemical end member mixing approach based on the following criteria 1 areal and vertical position overlying and adjacent to the oil field including locations with shallow and deep well pairs 2 proximity to current and historical oil production activities within a 500 m radius and 3 filling gaps in historical water quality data the compilation of existing data in combination with contacting local water purveyors and field canvassing identified 15 wells available for sampling that satisfied at least part of the selection criteria for the rmp table s5 fig 1 these 15 groundwater wells were sampled in the fall of 2017 through the spring of 2018 mccarlson et al 2021 the wells sampled included nine domestic four irrigation and two monitoring wells which covered a broad range of depths total well depths 56 299 m and settings wells located in areas of dense oil development to agricultural areas surrounding the oil field table s5 one other well or 16 sampled as part of the rmp was later determined to be a cathodic protection well the sample obtained from this well was not considered representative of actual groundwater conditions in the area and the data were rejected for use in the study in addition to data from water wells five oil wells and one injectate tank containing recycled produced water used for injection into the orcutt oil field were sampled in the spring of 2018 fig 1 seitz et al 2021 2 5 sample collection and analysis detailed protocols for groundwater samples collected by the usgs for the rmp are described by dillon et al 2016 following protocols established by the usgs national water quality assessment nawqa program koterba et al 1995 and the usgs national field manual u s geological survey variously dated only a brief description is given here these sampling protocols were followed so that representative samples of groundwater are collected at each site and the samples are collected and handled in ways to minimize the potential for introduction of target analytes during the sampling process samples of produced water were collected at the well head of oil wells and injectate sites by using methods described by mcmahon et al 2018a groundwater and produced water samples collected for the rmp were analyzed for a wide array of dissolved organic inorganic and gas constituents water and solute isotopes and age tracers based on the results from the rmp exploratory study conducted in 2014 and 2015 dillon et al 2016 mcmahon et al 2017b the complete list of analytical methods and references used in evaluation of rmp groundwater wells sampled in the area of the orcutt oil field from september 2017 to march 2018 are provided in table s6 for the produced water data presented in this report methods for field processing of samples and laboratory analyses were similar to those used for groundwater samples except that major ions and trace elements in produced water were analyzed by the usgs biogeochemical processes in groundwater laboratory in reston virginia rather than the usgs national water quality laboratory in lakewood colorado a discussion of quality control qc data collected for this study are reported in mccarlson et al 2021 and seitz et al 2021 additional

from 3 9 10 3 to 5 7 10 3 median 4 7 10 3 br cl ratio for or 13 6 2 10 3 located adjacent to the oil field appears to be enriched in br and cl and suggest these values could be derived from mixing of oil bearing formation water with native groundwater fig 3 although br cl ratios greater than seawater also have been associated with other sources such as landfills in some settings mullaney et al 2009 intermediate br cl ratios for or 2 4 0 10 3 and or 3 3 7 10 3 suggest water from oil bearing formations could be a source of br to groundwater overlying the oil field although the variability of br cl ratios of oil bearing formations means that br cl ratios are not conclusive fig 3 the highest nh3 concentration of 28 mg l as n was in rmp groundwater sample or 13 located adjacent to the oil field concentrations of nh3 in the remaining rmp groundwater samples ranged from 0 01 1 06 mg l as n fig 4 doc concentrations in groundwater collected as part of the rmp ranged from 0 14 to 4 4 mg l the highest doc concentrations were measured in groundwater samples adjacent to or 13 and overlying or 2 3 the oil field whereas groundwater samples away from the oil field had doc concentrations 1 0 mg l fig 4 possible explanations for the high nh3 and doc concentration in these groundwater samples or 2 3 13 could be n bearing matter in the reducing environment provided by aquifer sediments with appreciable organic matter harkness et al 2014 and or mixing between groundwater and small amounts of oil bearing formation waters with much higher nh3 and doc concentrations it is implausible that the high nh3 and doc concentration at or 13 could be from reduction of no3 in irrigation water recharge by interaction with organic matter because the groundwater is too old to contain modern recharge see next section additional constituents including major ion chemistry additional salinity tracers including iodide i stable isotopes of water δ2h and δ18o and volatile organic compounds vocs were evaluated but did not show consistent evidence of mixing of substantial quantities of water from oil producing formations in groundwater these results are discussed in the supplementary information 3 1 2 apparent groundwater ages the range of tritium 3h and carbon 14 14c age tracer values indicates that 12 of the 15 rmp groundwater samples were premodern recharged prior to 1953 similar to results in historical data collected from the study area see supplementary information fig s11 tritium was detected at 0 2 tritium units tu in three samples or 4 5 6 indicating traces of groundwater recharged after 1953 mixed with water containing premodern 14c values 14c 75 modern carbon pmc sites or 2 3 and 13 all had premodern aged groundwater or 13 appears to have some of the oldest groundwater in the study area with an uncorrected 14c activity of 2 8 pmc the older apparent groundwater ages are also the groundwater samples with enriched δ13c dic fig 5 for or 12 the slightly enriched δ13c dic value may reflect the addition of dic by the dissolution of calcite or dolomite along the groundwater flow path in contrast much greater enrichment of δ13c dic in or 13 is more likely from input of older sedimentary organic carbon to the dic via methanogenesis mixing between groundwater and oil bearing formation water with much heavier δ13c dic values and or degradation of organic carbon derived from oil bearing formations fig 5 a lack of δ13c values for many of the carbon sources e g organic matter dic in soil water and surface water and calcite from the soils or aquifers and the absence of a consistent relation between δ13c dic values and 14c activities complicates any correction for 14c radioactive decay to obtain a true groundwater age in elapsed time since recharge years and suggests quantitative interpretation of groundwater age based solely on 14c would be problematic however a recent analysis of 3h 4he and 14c data indicate the water from or 3 and or 13 could be 1000 years old mcmahon et al 2021 additional discussion on the use of age tracer data 3h 14c to classify groundwater ages is presented in the supplementary information 3 1 3 light hydrocarbon gas groundwater samples within the boundary of the orcutt oil field had methane ch4 c1 concentrations of 41 mg l or 2 and 22 mg l or 3 reflecting supersaturated and slightly undersaturated conditions respectively relative to equilibrium methane solubility in water at observed temperatures and pressures methane solubility in water equals 22 7 mg l at 25 c and 1 atm haynes 2016 fig 6 these samples also contained ethane c2h6 c2 and propane c3h8 c3 in concentrations of 0 12 and 1 6 10 3 mg l or 2 and 2 8 10 2 and 1 2 10 3 mg l or 3 respectively in addition traces of isobutane c4h10 c4 were also detected in these two samples 5 0 10 4 and 3 0 10 4 mol respectively mccarlson et al 2021 the presence of propane and trace amounts of isobutane indicate a thermogenic source is contributing hydrocarbon gas to these samples the groundwater sample located adjacent to the oil field had methane and ethane concentrations of 47 and 6 1 10 2 mg l or 13 fig 6 methane and ethane were detected at 4 other groundwater samples located near the oil field in concentrations of 0 4 and 3 4 10 3 mg l or 5 0 19 and 2 0 10 3 mg l or 4 2 4 10 3 and 6 1 10 4 mg l or 14 and 2 0 10 3 and 4 7 10 4 mg l or 8 respectively fig 6 microbial methane generally occurs in aquifers with low oxygen and low sulfate concentrations both 0 5 mg l chapelle et al 1995 mcmahon and chapelle 2008 while all these samples with elevated methane concentrations have dissolved oxygen concentrations 0 5 mg l the sulfate concentrations up to 619 mg l are high relative to aquifer conditions typically conducive to microbial methane production despite the high sulfate conditions methanogenesis is still a potential source of methane because the wells in question likely allow for a mixture of water from more than one oxidation reduction zone in the wellbore during sampling mcmahon and chapelle 2008 methane was detected in the remaining orcutt groundwater samples collected for the rmp at concentrations ranging from 2 0 10 4 to 6 3 10 3 mg l while produced water samples had methane concentrations that ranged from 0 9 to 100 mg l mccarlson et al 2021 seitz et al 2021 the δ2h ch4 and δ13c ch4 values for 5 groundwater samples that had methane concentrations high enough for isotopic analysis 0 05 mg l ranged from 62 16 to 33 59 per mil and 221 7 to 71 5 per mil respectively fig 7a using the classification provided by whiticar 1986 and considering microbial methane tends to exhibit depleted δ13c ch4 values in the range of 60 to 90 per mil taylor et al 2000 the methane isotopic values for the two groundwater samples overlying the oil field and in relative proximity to historical dense oil development or 2 3 suggest the source of the methane in these wells is mixed microbial thermogenic in origin fig 7a b furthermore the lack of δ13c dic enrichment in or 2 and or 3 fig 5 despite the high methane concentrations is not consistent with in situ methanogenesis and instead suggests the methane is sourced from outside the shallow aquifer overlying the oil field for the groundwater sample collected adjacent to the oil field or 13 the methane isotopic values suggest the source of the methane is microbial fig 7a b the higher concentration of methane at this site in comparison with other sites with microbial methane fig 7b in combination with the isotopically lightest methane figs 6 7a may reflect co2 reduction in water from oil bearing formations recall the groundwater sample adjacent to the oil field or 13 exhibits an anomalously enriched δ13c dic value fig 5 which suggests the methanogenic activity supported by a high doc concentration in this sample could be why the microbial methane is so much higher in this sample compared to other sites with microbial methane two of the 5 groundwater samples or 2 and or 13 contained enough ethane for isotopic analysis and the δ13c c2h6 values appear to be characteristic of thermogenic ethane figs 6 7c the measured δ13c c2h6 values of 28 6 per mil or 2 and 27 4 per mil or 13 are similar to those measured in the produced water samples and are much heavier than values for microbial ethane described by taylor et al 2000 fig 7c for the other groundwater samples that had methane concentrations high enough for isotopic analysis or 4 5 the combination of δ13c ch4 δ2h ch4 and c1 c2 c3 molar ratios suggest the methane is microbial in origin and has undergone various amounts of methane oxidation rather than being derived from thermogenic sources fig 7a d microbially mediated methane oxidation favors isotopically light methane thus methane oxidation causes 13c enrichment in the residual methane which could shift light δ13c ch4 values in microbial gas toward heavier δ13c ch4 values more characteristic of thermogenic gas schoell 1980 whiticar 1999 historical groundwater samples collected in the san antonio creek groundwater basin during 2017 indicate methane was widely detected in wells 12 out of 27 sites sampled with concentrations of 0 09 to 0 34 mg l at three sites to the south of the orcutt oil field fig 6 although no other hydrocarbon gas concentration or isotopic data were measured in the san antonio creek valley groundwater basin prior to this study similarity to rmp samples outside the boundary of the oil field indicates microbial methane is sometimes present at concentrations up to about 0 4 mg l and is widespread in groundwater at concentrations ranging from about 8 0 10 4 to 7 0 10 3 mg l 3 1 4 noble gas compositions the isotopes of the atmospherically derived noble gases 20ne 36ar 84kr and 132xe were analyzed to identify groundwater that has interacted with oil and gas sources deep crustal or mantle sources has excess atmospheric gases indicating recent atmospheric exposure or has been affected by gas water partitioning processes during groundwater flow through aquifers hunt et al 2012 darrah et al 2014 karolytė et al 2021 the majority of samples reflect air equilibration with entrainment of excess air however two groundwater samples located overlying the oil field or 2 3 and to a lesser extent one groundwater sample adjacent to the oil field or 13 exhibited deviations from asw air saturated water values values of 20ne 36ar versus 132xe 36ar normalized to the asw values exhibit depletion of the lighter noble gases along with enrichment of the heavier noble gases in or 2 or 3 and or 13 fig 8a and indicate these groundwaters may have been affected by degassing preferentially stripping the lighter noble gases out of the groundwater these samples also contained mixed thermogenic microbial methane or ethane and elevated 4he and chloride concentrations suggesting a mixture of thermogenic gas and water from oil bearing formations with native groundwater the stripping of the lighter noble gases along with enrichment in crustal fluids and gases 4he cl and mixed microbial thermogenic ch4 or c2h6 provide evidence for two phase migration during transport of thermogenic gas and water from oil bearing formations into the shallow aquifer system overlying and possibly adjacent to the orcutt oil field furthermore the age tracer data 14c in these samples and elevated 4he concentrations suggest the groundwater has been isolated from the atmosphere for some time thousands to tens of thousands of years before present fig 8b and as such the high chloride concentrations are unlikely the result of a surface spill the remaining groundwater samples exhibited concentrations and isotopic compositions of noble gases in combination with age tracer data consistent with ancient likely thousands of years old groundwater in equilibrium with atmospheric gases from recharge with minor amounts of excess air bubble entrainment and trace amounts of in situ produced 4he fig 8a b these results indicate no evidence for groundwater interaction with water oil or thermogenic gas from oil bearing formations in the majority of samples collected as part of the rmp additional discussion on the evidence for light noble gas degassing in the orcutt groundwater samples is presented in the supplementary information 3 2 relevant indicators of oil bearing formation water and thermogenic gas in groundwater comparison of salinity tracers tds cl and br nh3 doc and δ13c dic values in groundwater and oil field water in the area of the orcutt oil field indicated up to three groundwater samples adjacent to or 13 and overlying the oil field or 2 3 in decreasing order of likelihood may be mixed with oil bearing formation water other water sources similar in composition or more complex mixtures of different sources of relatively brackish water the well adjacent to the oil field or 13 appeared to contain groundwater mixed with oil bearing formation water based on having the highest measured groundwater values of salinity tracers tds cl br nh3 and doc intermediate between most groundwater values and oil producing formation water the enriched δ13c dic isotopes and high methane concentrations for this groundwater sample adjacent to the oil field or 13 cannot be explained solely by inorganic carbonate reactions aravena et al 1995 and suggests that the δ13c dic values are influenced by methanogenesis supported by organic carbon derived from oil bearing formation water and or mixing between groundwater and oil bearing formation waters with much heavier δ13c dic values finally the presence of thermogenic ethane as indicated by a δ13c c2h6 value of 27 4 per mil is consistent with a mixture of native groundwater with some deeper water similar in composition to oil bearing formation water the absence of other indicators of thermogenic hydrocarbon gas in this sample e g propane could indicate the thermogenic component is very small and or the heavier hydrocarbon gases have been oxidized concentrations of tds cl br and doc in the two wells overlying the oil field or 2 and or 3 were intermediate between most groundwater and oil bearing formation water potentially indicating mixing but concentrations were lower than those in or 13 adjacent to the oil field and not all tracers e g i δ18o h2o unambiguously indicate mixing with an oil bearing formation water a possible explanation is that these samples are complex mixtures that include oil bearing formation water of variable composition and or other sources of naturally brackish groundwater near the oil field the presence of thermogenic gas in or 2 and or 3 overlying the oil field is indicated by elevated 4he concentrations enriched methane isotopes detection of c3 c5 gas and hydrocarbon gas ratios the presence of thermogenic gas in or 2 is further indicated by enriched ethane isotopes for or 13 the presence of thermogenic gas adjacent to the oil field is indicated by slightly elevated 4he concentrations and enriched ethane isotopes relative to microbial ethane fig 7c it is important to note that detections of thermogenic gas in groundwater are not by themselves an indication of groundwater quality degradation associated with oil and gas sources instead these gas detections are an indicator that there are potential pathways connecting groundwater to hydrocarbon sources whether in oil production zones or non producing geologic sources near groundwater wells methane and other light hydrocarbon gases are not regulated drinking water constituents posing any known health risk and the presence of these gases does not indicate degraded water quality although the presence of these gases in high concentrations may represent an explosion hazard in confined spaces in some cases eltschlager et al 2001 the three groundwater samples that appear to be influenced by water from oil bearing formations had concentrations of chloride higher than the recommended 250 mg l secondary maximum contaminant level california state water resources control board 2019 created to ensure that water does not cause undesirable aesthetic effects in drinking water although groundwater from these wells is not used for drinking water 3 3 potential sources pathways for water and thermogenic gas from oil bearing formations the presence of elevated concentrations of 4he and mixed microbial thermogenic methane in two water wells directly overlying the orcutt oil field and completed at shallower depths than the oil producing formations or 2 and or 3 along with thermogenic ethane present in or 2 may indicate thermogenic gas migration along natural flow paths through formations or faults if present or could follow anthropogenic pathways such as compromised wells wellbores potentially influenced by oil field development activities that may affect lateral and vertical pressure gradients migration of stray gas from oil field formations has been implicated as a source of methane and to a lesser extent ethane observed in groundwater in other oil producing regions jackson et al 2013b sherwood et al 2016a and 2016b whyte et al 2021 but have been attributed to both anthropogenic and natural pathways and processes likewise the enrichment in 4he and mixed microbial thermogenic methane without the corresponding increase in salinity tracers could potentially result from natural oil and gas shows within the aquifer sediments in oil bearing formations overlying the zones where commercial oil extraction occurs other chemical and isotopic data previously discussed tds cl br nh3 doc and δ13c dic do not indicate definitive evidence that oil bearing formation water has mixed with groundwater being tapped by these wells although small amounts of mixing could be indicated by the data although there is not enough information to determine specific sources of thermogenic gas to nearby rmp sampled groundwater wells there are potential anthropogenic pathways located in proximity to some groundwater wells with detections of thermogenic gas review of available records and data described below indicate that potential pathways exist in places between oil production and groundwater zones these conditions could allow upward movement of water and or thermogenic gas from oil zones into overlying groundwater we examined several factors including the distance and characteristics of the nearest oil well the well status the depth of wells used for oil production and injection depth to base of freshwater well integrity issues the presence of oil and gas shows in sediments overlying the orcutt oil field and the 1977 2017 vol of injection for enhanced recovery and produced water disposal in proximity to rmp sampled groundwater wells of the 15 oil wells within 500 m of rmp sampled groundwater wells specifically or 2 3 5 9 11 approximately 87 of the wells were classified as plugged and abandoned 7 wells abandoned before 1976 whereas new active or idle wells made up the remaining 13 fig s5 table s2 groundwater wells or 2 and or 3 have 10 and 8 oil wells located within 500 m respectively 6 of the 12 oil wells within 500 m of either water well were constructed and plugged and abandoned before 1976 tables s2 s3 as an example the closest oil well api 08302063 to or 2 is 76 m away and has potential pathways and historical observations of leakage tables s2 s3 that oil well was drilled in 1906 to a total depth of 1133 9 m with no record of cement in the borehole annulus above 716 m and was plugged and abandoned in 1946 with damaged casing below 99 m and cement plugs installed above that depth table s3 site inspections related to new planned infrastructure in 2008 noted water seeping around the outside of the heavily corroded casing california department of conservation 2020b among the oil and gas wells within 500 m of the rmp sampled groundwater wells well reports california department of conservation 2020b were reviewed to assess the occurrence of reported well integrity issues including casing damage or collapse at depth well construction integrity issue and water or gas leaks around the casing or from the wellhead at the surface surface expression of the 15 oil wells six had well integrity issues at depths potentially intersecting the groundwater resource zone these included one well with a well construction integrity issue one well with a surface expression and four wells with both well construction integrity issues and surface expressions table s3 all six of these wells were installed during 1901 1907 and plugged and abandoned between 1946 and 2012 well construction integrity issues also were noted in four of the oil wells at depths within oil and gas producing zones below fresh groundwater however three of these wells had cement in the wellbore annulus and or cement plugs installed in the casing during well abandonment in overlying zones indicating that well integrity issues in producing zones would be unlikely to provide a potential transport pathway to groundwater the cement distributions in overlying zones in the fourth well were not recorded table s3 the losses of water or gas from target zones during the installation and development of injection and production wells have been noted in other cases outside of those reported within 500 m of sampled water wells but have not been systematically documented across the field the magnitude of these subsurface releases is unknown a connection between the thermogenic methane and or water from oil bearing formations in groundwater wells and nearby oil wells with possible integrity issues cannot be ruled out or conclusively established another potential source pathway for thermogenic gas are oil and gas shows that naturally occur in places in sediments overlying the orcutt oil field analysis of 33 mud logs within the administrative boundary of the oil field indicates that shallow oil and gas shows are present in sediments at shallow depths overlying the oil field in upland portions of the field where oil zones are closest to land surface table s4 figs 2 9a b at these locations oil and gas shows can occur at depths of as little as 16 8 m below land surface bls and 15 2 m bls respectively in some upland areas table s4 fig 9a b in the closest mud log to or 2 and or 3 the first appearance of oil and gas shows are reported api 08322543 at elevations of 220 and 258 m respectively compared with top of perforation elevations for or 2 and or 3 of 147 and 165 m respectively located 912 m to the south it is presumed that oil gas shows in mud logs reflect the natural distribution over geologic time and not redistribution following oil development activities and that oil bearing formation water would co occur with oil gas shows the sampled wells or 2 and or 3 are located within an alluvial valley incised into the sometimes oil bearing basal layer of the careaga formation and the underlying sisquoc formation kuuskraa et al 1987 which generally dip to the south fig s3 california department of conservation 1992 although the density of the data is low it is possible that the occurrence of thermogenic gas and oil bearing formation water in groundwater at these sites may reflect lateral or vertical transport of these constituents from geologic sources oil bearing formations in the oil bearing sediments overlying the oil field mixtures of oil bearing formation water with groundwater are indicated for sample or 13 collected from outside the boundary of the oil field groundwater age tracers 3h and 14c indicate the groundwater was at least recharged prior to 1953 and is likely ancient 3h not detected 14c 2 8 pmc the notion of ancient groundwater existing adjacent to the oil field is further supported by noble gas data 4he 4 05 10 7 cm3 stp g where stp is standard temperature and pressure and may preclude a historical produced water disposal pond or dump site from being the source of the oil bearing formation water instead potential sources pathways for oil bearing formation water include lateral movement from nearby oil fields orcutt or casmalia to the west along natural flow paths through formations or faults or anthropogenic pathways such as wells wellbores which may may not be influenced by oil field development activities such as injection however the nearest oil wells are located 470 m away from or 13 and areas of dense oil wells and injections are located almost 1000 m to the east fig 2 table s2 another possible source pathway for oil bearing formation water to groundwater is unidentified oil and gas shows in the aquifer adjacent to the oil field however the absence of mud logs and oil exploration test holes means there are no data for assessing shallow oil and gas occurrence in this area but that previous oil exploration did not regard this area as target for economic quantities of hydrocarbons finally the areas of the orcutt oil field having the highest injection volumes co located with plugged and abandoned wells are in the northern part of the field fig 2 these areas may have the highest risk of water gas and oil from oil bearing formations reaching overlying zones because of the absence of groundwater wells in these areas the effects of these factors if any cannot be evaluated without additional data additional discussion on the movement of water from oil producing formations to groundwater along potential anthropogenic or natural pathways is presented in the supplementary information 3 4 multiple lines of evidence for oil bearing formation water and or thermogenic gas in groundwater identification of the presence of oil bearing formation water and thermogenic gas in some groundwater wells required the use of analytes with little or no historical data including light hydrocarbon gas concentration and isotopic data carbon isotopic values of dissolved inorganic carbon dissolved organic carbon groundwater age tracers and noble gases these analyses provide multiple lines of evidence for the presence of oil bearing formation water and or thermogenic gas in three of the 15 groundwater wells sampled other groundwater samples collected as part of the rmp along with available historical data showed no evidence of mixing with water from oil bearing formations results of the groundwater sampling to investigate the occurrence of water and thermogenic gas from oil bearing formations in groundwater are summarized in table s7 in two wells available for sampling within the boundary of the orcutt oil field and in relative proximity to historical dense oil development or 2 and or 3 the following relevant indicators of water and gas from oil bearing formations detected in groundwater near the orcutt oil field were 1 thermogenic light hydrocarbon gas ch4 c2h6 c3h8 mixed with microbial ch4 2 elevated concentrations of tds and cl minor ion ratios br cl nh3 and doc potentially indicating small amounts of oil bearing formation water present and 3 depletion of lighter noble gases and enrichment of heavier noble gases in these samples particularly or 2 indicating the sampled groundwater has been affected by gas migration independent of water movement the source and pathways of the thermogenic gas in groundwater at these wells cannot be determined conclusively from the available data possibilities include 1 upward movement from underlying oil and gas producing formations along a natural flow paths through formations or faults or b anthropogenic pathways such as wells wellbores and or influenced by oil field development activities such as injection and 2 oil and gas shows that occur in water bearing sediments overlying the orcutt oil field at or 13 elevated concentrations of tds cl nh3 and doc minor ion ratios br cl and i cl and enriched δ13c dic and δ13c c2h6 values are consistent with mixing of oil bearing formation water and thermogenic gas from a subsurface source but could also be partially explained by old brackish groundwater interacting with aquifer sediments in a reducing environment with appreciable nitrogen and organic matter undetectable tritium low uncorrected 14c activity 2 8 pmc and noble gas ratios indicate the groundwater is ancient although there is historical evidence of legacy disposal of produced water in surface ponds affecting groundwater in this area enviromanagement inc 2016a 2016b the age tracer and noble gas data are incongruent with or 13 being affected by a surface pond source 3 5 limitations and uncertainties the initial phase of the rmp uses existing infrastructure to achieve coverage across many oil field areas in california as a result sampling locations and depths for more precise determination of pathways were non ideal and limited by the small number of wells available for sampling groundwater overlying and near the edge of the orcutt oil field due to the low sampling density a definitive analysis of relations to potential anthropogenic and natural explanatory factors was not possible as a result the sources and pathways of the thermogenic light hydrocarbon gas and or water from oil bearing formations detected in some groundwater wells overlying and near the orcutt oil field cannot be confirmed at present in order to further evaluate the source and pathways at local scales we suggest 1 a higher density of groundwater observational data located at various vertical and horizontal distances from oil and gas production including water sample data and analysis of available temperature and borehole resistivity data which are available in some areas of oil development where groundwater wells are absent 2 additional data on potential end member compositions including oil production zones and samples from discrete depths where oil and gas shows in aquifer sediments overlying the zones of oil production occur 3 additional data collection and analysis to determine pressure gradients between oil production and groundwater zones and their relations to groundwater withdrawals and oil and gas reservoir production and injection and 4 expanded analysis of oil well seals across the oil field to document the incidence of potential pathways a more detailed description of suggested future analysis is provided in the supplementary information 4 conclusions the california state water resources control board in cooperation with the u s geological survey implemented the oil and gas regional monitoring program rmp near the orcutt oil field to address concerns about groundwater quality in regions of oil and gas development activities the findings of this study indicate most groundwater in the area of the orcutt oil field appears to be of good quality with respect to the constituents analyzed since most groundwater samples as well as available inorganic historical chemistry data showed no indication of water from oil bearing formations in groundwater these results support previous water quality studies which have noted irrigation return flow natural occurring water rock interaction and lateral seepage from the surrounding outcrops of marine rocks are the predominant processes contributing to the salinity in groundwater in the study area the chemical and isotopic composition of three of the 15 groundwater samples obtained as part of the study indicated potential mixing with water and or hydrocarbon gas from oil bearing formations the relevant indicators used to identify the presence of oil bearing formation water and thermogenic gas in groundwater included three or more of the following 1 elevated salinity tracers tds cl br nh3 and doc 2 enriched δ13c dic values 3 higher methane concentrations with trace amounts of propane and isobutane 4 δ2h ch4 and δ13c ch4 values intermediate between thermogenic hydrocarbon and microbial gas 5 δ13c c2h6 values consistent with a thermogenic source and 6 depletion of light noble gases relative to heavier noble gases in combination with elevated 4he concentrations the potential sources pathways for the occurrence of water and thermogenic gas in groundwater near the orcutt oil field included 1 upward movement from oil producing formations due to a anthropogenic activity such as injection and or movement along leaky wells wellbores or b natural migration through formations and or faults and 2 non producing oil bearing formations overlying and adjacent to the oil field determination of oil field sources and pathways affecting groundwater were limited by the small number of wells available in areas of oil development future insight on sources and pathways for thermogenic gas and water from oil bearing formations could be provided by denser data on groundwater and potential end member compositions from new and existing wells analysis of borehole temperature and resistivity data and assessments of the potential for upwelling of water and thermogenic hydrocarbon gas from vertical

fields salinity tracers thermogenic hydrocarbon gas multiple lines of evidence 1 introduction efforts to assess the potential effects on groundwater quality from gas and water associated with hydrocarbon production activities have increased with recent oil and gas drilling activities throughout the united states brantley et al 2014 vengosh et al 2014 digiulio and jackson 2016 the degradation of shallow groundwater quality from saline water derived from oil and gas production activities has been the focus of some studies warner et al 2012 2013 mcmahon et al 2015 groundwater quality may also be affected by natural sources of saline water and hydrocarbon gas from oil and gas shows in aquifer sediments overlying the hydrocarbon production zone warner et al 2012 flewelling and sharma 2014 siegel et al 2015a 2015b engle et al 2016 harkness et al 2017 many studies have focused on determining the sources of methane and other hydrocarbon gases observed in shallow

gooddy 2006 schloemer et al 2016 mcmahon et al 2017a lackner et al 2018 alternatively some groundwater in aquifer systems near active oil and gas development activities can also contain methane and

2018b wen et al 2018 kreuzer et al 2018 hydrocarbon gases in many of those oil bearing formations are produced by abiotic processes at relatively high temperatures thermogenic gas and are enriched in heavier hydrocarbon gases ethane propane butane and pentane compared to microbial gas schoell 1980 whiticar 1999 although produced at depth thermogenic methane can migrate into shallow aquifers through advection by deeply circulating groundwater and as the result of diffusion from high to low concentration baldassare et al 2014 moritz et al 2015 oxidation reduction condition indicators abundances of methane and higher chain hydrocarbons hydrogen h and carbon c stable isotopes in methane δ2h ch4 δ13c ch4 c stable isotopes in dissolved inorganic carbon δ13c dic and other geochemical tracers have been used to differentiate between microbial and thermogenic gas in shallow groundwater coleman et al 1988 aravena et al 1995 jackson et al 2013b darrah et al 2014 wright et al 2019 mcmahon et al 2019 other recent studies have examined aspects of the quality of groundwater near some oil field areas in california kang and jackson 2016 mcmahon et al 2017b 2019 kulongoski et al 2018 wright et al 2019 gillespie et al 2019 rosecrans et al 2021 while others have characterized the chemistry of produced water or casing gas from oil fields mcmahon et al 2018a tyne et al 2021 for example the study of the fruitvale oil field near bakersfield determined that groundwater quality was primarily influenced by high rates of recharge from the kern river with only trace detections of water and thermogenic gas from oil bearing formations potentially including that from producing and non producing oil bearing formations in a few wells wright et al 2019 in the study of the oxnard oil field in ventura county an oil and gas production area not dominated by high regional freshwater recharge the highest concentrations of thermogenic gas in groundwater were observed in proximity to relatively high density of oil wells large injection volumes of water disposal and cyclic steam shallow oil development and hydrocarbon shows in sediments overlying the producing oil reservoirs rosecrans et al 2021 the california state water resources control board state water board has implemented a regional groundwater monitoring program in cooperation with the u s geological survey usgs to address concerns about groundwater quality in regions of oil and gas development activities the oil and gas regional monitoring program rmp was authorized by california senate bill 4 sb 4 statutes of 2013 and includes assessment of potential impacts to groundwater quality associated with well stimulation hydraulic fracturing enhanced recovery injection water and steam flooding and production in oil producing formations and produced water disposal in injection wells and surface ponds california state water resources control board 2019 the rmp is designed to 1 assess the location of groundwater resources with 10 000 mg l total dissolved solids in proximity to oil and gas fields 2 assess evidence for the presence absence of water and or thermogenic gas from oil bearing formations mixed with groundwater and if present identify potential pathways or processes that may be responsible and 3 determine how oil and gas sources have affected groundwater quality relative to other processes u s geological survey 2019b california state water resources control board 2019 the orcutt oil field located in santa barbara county california and one of several oil fields in the onshore santa maria basin is the first oil field in this basin to be studied as part of the rmp the orcutt oil field has a longer history of oil field development then most other oil fields in california california department of conservation 1992 beginning in 1901 after the discovery of surface occurrences of hydrocarbons from petroleum saturated fissures and exposed oil bearing sands and shales in upland areas of the field early conventional development was followed by more than a half century of use of enhanced recovery practices including injection of water and steam california department of conservation 1992 furthermore groundwater resources used intensively for drinking water and irrigation are located in the adjacent san antonio creek and santa maria river valleys and not directly overlying the oil field as has been the case in other recently studied oil field settings wright et al 2019 rosecrans et al 2021 the combination of naturally occurring shallow oil and gas resources and century long oil field development in lateral proximity to used groundwater resources makes this a relevant setting for evaluating relations of groundwater quality to oil and gas sources not previously studied as part of the rmp davis et al 2018 this study uses multiple lines of evidence including the local hydrogeologic setting the geologic structure of the santa maria basin oil field development and production injection information and geochemical end member analyses to 1 determine if water and thermogenic gas from oil bearing formations occur in groundwater overlying and adjacent to the orcutt oil field and 2 explore possible pathways for these occurrences to achieve these goals a wide array of newly collected chemical isotopic dissolved gas and age dating tracers and historical water chemistry data from groundwater and oil wells were analyzed in conjunction with potential explanatory factors a conceptual schematic of the oil and gas terminology fig s1 and glossary used in this work is provided in the supplementary information 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the study area boundary is a 5 kilometer km buffer around the administrative boundary of the orcutt oil field which is located in the solomon hills south of the unincorporated town of orcutt in santa barbara county fig 1 the orcutt oil field is approximately bounded by the foothills of california s south coast ranges to the east and west the trough of the santa maria valley to the north and the san antonio creek valley to the south the region has a mediterranean climate with cool and rainy winters and dry summers during which the heat is greatly diminished by fog and northwesterly winds from the cold water of the pacific ocean which is about 24 km west of the field average annual precipitation ranges from 33 to 48 centimeters cm with a typical rainy season lasting from around november to april california department of water resources 2003 regional groundwater flow in the study area is generally westward toward the pacific ocean california dwr 2003 contours of the elevation of the water table indicate groundwater flows to the southwest into the san antonio creek valley groundwater basin hutchinson 1980 and northwest into the santa maria river valley groundwater basin hughes 1977 from the oil field which straddles the two groundwater basins fig s2 previous water quality studies have noted irrigation return flow upward migration of deep groundwater natural occurring water rock interaction lateral seepage from the surrounding outcrops of marine rocks and point sources of discharge of wastewater from oil refineries and domestic wastewater treatment facilities in the city of santa maria can affect groundwater salinity in the region although not all of these sources occur within 5 km of the orcutt oil field worts 1951 muir 1964 hughes 1977 hutchinson 1980 a more detailed description of the hydrogeologic setting is provided in the supplementary information 2 2 orcutt oil field the orcutt oil field with an area of almost 44 5 km2 is one of several oil fields in the onshore santa maria basin discovered in 1901 the proven productive area of the orcutt oil field is approximately 17 1 km2 or 38 4 of the total area california department of conservation 1992 although the area of the orcutt oil field is relatively small it represents a setting with intensive oil and gas development in upland areas adjacent to downslope groundwater aquifers used for drinking and irrigation supply that is common in many other coastal and inland groundwater basins of california davis et al 2018 planert and williams 1995 and other tectonically active areas of the world schenk et al 2012 where oil fields often occur in uplands adjacent to basin aquifers the stratigraphy of the santa maria basin in the area of the orcutt oil field is composed of lower miocene and younger tertiary formations through quaternary sedimentary rocks that lie above the regional unconformity associated with the late eocene to early oligocene ynezian orogeny namson and davis 1990 sweetkind et al 2010 fig s3 a more detailed description of the stratigraphy of the santa maria basin is provided in the supplementary information the monterey formation rich in organic matter is the principal source of oil in the santa maria basin with most production from depths between 600 and 1200 m isaacs and rullkötter 2001 petroleum traps within the santa maria basin are of two major types structural anticlinal and stratigraphic overlap truncation or sandstone pitchout isaacs 1992 oil in the orcutt oil field is trapped in a faulted asymmetrical anticline with a broad flat crest gently dipping south limb and steeply dipping or overturned north limb namson and davis 1990 fig s3 the north limb of the anticline is cut by the steeply dipping orcutt fault a reverse fault that offsets miocene and lower pliocene strata 600 1525 m from the crest of the anticline to the downthrown northern footwall fig 2 s3 in the orcutt oil field the monterey formation produces oil with low to moderate gravity whereas shallower pools have generally heavier oil isaacs and rullkötter 2001 peak oil production occurred in 1908 production began to slow as early as the 1920s and waterflooding to enhance oil recovery began in 1951 diatomite and sx zones of the sisquoc formation have been developed for oil production over approximately the last 15 years when the diatomite cyclic steam pilot program provided the necessary information to determine the commercial viability of these oil deposits using thermal cyclic steam technology developed for similar formations in the san joaquin valley california department of conservation 1992 pacific coast energy company 2017 during 1977 2017 the cumulative production volumes for the orcutt oil field were about 1060 mmbbl 106 barrels of produced water and 38 1 mmbbl of oil california department of conservation 2020a in this work produced water is defined as water withdrawn from an oil well and brought to the surface and may include oil water and gas from the geologic formation and water and or gas injected for enhanced recovery see the glossary of terms provided in the supplementary information cumulative water injection volumes for enhanced oil recovery eor between 1977 and 2017 were about 1004 mmbbl into the monterey formation with smaller injection volumes 15 6 mmbbl into the shallower diatomite and sx units of the sisquoc formation table s1 during the same 40 yr period injection volumes for produced water disposal were about 68 3 mmbbl into the monterey formation and 1 3 mmbbl into the deeper point sal and lospe formations table s1 enhanced oil recovery in the orcutt oil field has typically been accomplished by water flooding although due to the increased use of cyclic steam injection the shallower diatomite and sx units have become more targeted zones for oil recovery where present fig 2 in 2016 the orcutt oil field contained 455 new active or idle oil wells and 257 plugged and abandoned wells mostly in the northern part of the field spud or construction dates are available for 635 oil wells fig 2 s4 california department of conservation 2020a b c the majority of wells in the oil field were installed before 1976 62 although recent activity targeting the shallower diatomite and sx units in the newlove hill area has resulted in the recent construction of many more oil wells in contrast well plugging and abandonment saw little activity from about 1930 to the present day suggesting oil wells constructed many years ago still exist in the oil field fig s4 state requirements for cementing wellbores during installation and abandoning oil wells have become more rigorous over time including statewide regulations to protect useable groundwater in 1976 california department of conservation 2019 although the timing of implementation of oil well construction practices to protect groundwater in the orcutt oil field could differ from those statewide the history of changes in well construction practices in this specific field was not apparent from available records therefore 1976 was used as an approximate date for classifying oil wells into older and newer periods of construction california dept of conservation 2019 older wells may generally be more likely to have unsealed boreholes and or leaky casings that have the potential to facilitate the movement of water and gas between oil bearing formations and overlying groundwater additional discussion on oil well construction activity in the orcutt oil field is provided in the supplementary information 2 2 1 oil and gas shows surface outcrops or shallow oil sands and seeps many of which are up dip or lie above some of the largest oil and gas fields in california have been known for thousands of years heizer 1940 mulqueen 2007 there are numerous occurrences of tar sands asphalt dikes oil impregnated sandstone surficial oil sand deposits and oil and thermogenic gas detected during drilling in shallow sediments oil and gas shows in the sisquoc and careaga formations in the area of the orcutt oil field hein 2013 arnold and anderson 1907 noted the presence of asphalt deposits across graciosa ridge as a surface indication for the presence of oil in appreciable quantities in the region although there is no recorded history of natural seepage in other areas of the orcutt oil field newlove hill fig 1 has historically had many naturally occurring oil seeps leck 1921 field operators observe 2 4 new seeps per year in this area marine research specialists 2016 the presence of oil and gas shows in aquifer sediments overlying oil producing zones at some locations in the study area may indicate that upward movement of oil gas and perhaps water from deep formations occurred in response to natural hydrocarbon migration over geologic time hornafius et al 1999 quigley et al 1999 leifer 2010 oil seeps releases of crude oil formed by low energy non eruptive leakages of oil and gas to the ground surface from accumulations in the sisquoc and careaga formations can result from either natural occurring forces plate tectonics or the heating cooling and imbalance of injection fluids into the shallow diatomite unit of the sisquoc formation pacific coast energy company 2017 additional description of oil and gas shows is provided in the supplementary information mud logs allow for the identification of oil shows or detections and concentration measurements ppm of light hydrocarbon gas methane through pentane during the drilling process and are reported as vertical profiles of observations with depth for selected oil wells and depth intervals analysis of 33 available mud logs from oil wells indicate oil and gas shows occur in sediments in some areas overlying producing zones where commercial oil extraction occurs in the orcutt oil field see section 2 3 2 2 3 compilation of existing data during 2017 2019 the usgs compiled and analyzed information for the orcutt oil field and surrounding area the information included available groundwater and produced water chemistry data water and oil well construction and geophysical records oil field development history and injection data and hydrogeologic information such as regional groundwater flow directions oil companies were invited to share relevant information for inclusion in the study usgs scientists also consulted with california geologic energy management division calgem staff familiar with the oil field the goal of these compilation efforts and consultations was to obtain the most complete record of information possible 2 3 1 historical water chemistry data water chemistry data were compiled for a limited available set of analytes from 27 groundwater sites sampled in 2017 for a study investigating water availability in the san antonio creek valley groundwater basin u s geological survey 2020 and 121 sites with groundwater data collected between 1927 and 2016 and are referred to as historical groundwater chemistry data hereinafter fig 1 the historical groundwater chemistry data came from the usgs national water information system u s geological survey 2018a the california state water resources control board division of drinking water database california state water resources control board 2018 and the california department of water resources california department of water resources 2018 historical produced water chemistry data for inorganic constituents from a compilation of available oil field water sample data from 1971 to 2016 median date 1993 were used in the analysis blondes et al 2018 metzger and herrera 2020 2 3 2 attribution of wells with potential explanatory factors data were compiled for three major categories of potential explanatory factors 1 oil field development density and proximity 2 hydrogeologic variables and 3 presumed natural geologic distribution of oil and gas shows observations in the subsurface from available oil well mud logs the 15 groundwater wells sampled for the rmp see section 2 4 were attributed with potential oil development explanatory factors assembled from available information potential explanatory factors representing oil field development density and proximity describe the distance and characteristics of the nearest oil well and the number status type year drilled and the 1977 2017 vol of oil and water produced and water injected for enhanced recovery and produced water disposal for oil wells within a 500 m radius table s2 also attributed were oil well cement seals and plugs potential well integrity issues casing damage or collapse leaks and surface expressions and reported depth to base of freshwater within 500 m of sampled water wells table s3 the data were extracted from well reports and databases available from the california department of conservation 2020a b the 500 m radius was selected to provide a consistent basis for comparing the relative abundance of various factors in proximity to sampled wells and has been previously used in studies of regional groundwater quality johnson and belitz 2009 although the actual radius around a sampled well in which potential sources could influence groundwater quality is unknown and could vary by site the data available for direct comparison of water chemistry and potential oil development variables were limited because only 2 of the 15 wells sampled or 2 3 were located within the oil field boundary and in proximity to active oil development 5 sampled water wells had 15 oil wells located within the 500 m radius fig s5 table s3 away from the limited locations with groundwater sample data within the orcutt oil field the spatial distribution of factors that have the potential to affect risk to groundwater are discussed generally based on the distribution of oil wells well ages and injection volumes hydrogeologic variables evaluated included the conceptual position of sampled wells along regional groundwater flow directions based on the regional groundwater elevation contours in the san antonio creek valley and santa maria river valley groundwater basins fig s2 well perforation depths and well type see section 2 4 the distribution of oil shows and light hydrocarbon gas with depth in the aquifers overlying the oil production zones was compiled from 33 available mud logs located within the orcutt oil field boundary california department of conservation 2020b mud logging also known as hydrocarbon well logging entails gathering qualitative and semi quantitative data from hydrocarbon gas detectors that record the level of natural gas brought up in the drilling mud combined with oil field gas chromatograph instruments that determine the individual gas components most commonly methane ethane propane butane and pentane crain 2010 the recorded concentration of gas in mud logs do not represent the actual quantity of oil or gas in the sediments crain 2010 but rather the gas detected in the drilling mud with respect to depth oil shows as a percent of mud log cuttings are determined by hydrocarbon fluorescence a method in which hydrocarbons in cuttings are examined under ultraviolet light with a reagent that can indicate the presence of oil swanson 1981 in this work a list of mud logs in the orcutt oil field table s6 and recorded occurrence of the shallowest c3 c5 hydrocarbon gas and oil show were used to evaluate the presence or absence of light hydrocarbons and depths for which the hydrocarbon gas were observed relative to first appearance of trace amounts of oil oil shows relations of water chemistry to these factors and potential shallow geologic sources of hydrocarbons indicated by mud logs are discussed later in this manuscript 2 4 well selection procedure and type of wells sampled wells were selected for sampling for this study by using a geochemical end member mixing approach based on the following criteria 1 areal and vertical position overlying and adjacent to the oil field including locations with shallow and deep well pairs 2 proximity to current and historical oil production activities within a 500 m radius and 3 filling gaps in historical water quality data the compilation of existing data in combination with contacting local water purveyors and field canvassing identified 15 wells available for sampling that satisfied at least part of the selection criteria for the rmp table s5 fig 1 these 15 groundwater wells were sampled in the fall of 2017 through the spring of 2018 mccarlson et al 2021 the wells sampled included nine domestic four irrigation and two monitoring wells which covered a broad range of depths total well depths 56 299 m and settings wells located in areas of dense oil development to agricultural areas surrounding the oil field table s5 one other well or 16 sampled as part of the rmp was later determined to be a cathodic protection well the sample obtained from this well was not considered representative of actual groundwater conditions in the area and the data were rejected for use in the study in addition to data from water wells five oil wells and one injectate tank containing recycled produced water used for injection into the orcutt oil field were sampled in the spring of 2018 fig 1 seitz et al 2021 2 5 sample collection and analysis detailed protocols for groundwater samples collected by the usgs for the rmp are described by dillon et al 2016 following protocols established by the usgs national water quality assessment nawqa program koterba et al 1995 and the usgs national field manual u s geological survey variously dated only a brief description is given here these sampling protocols were followed so that representative samples of groundwater are collected at each site and the samples are collected and handled in ways to minimize the potential for introduction of target analytes during the sampling process samples of produced water were collected at the well head of oil wells and injectate sites by using methods described by mcmahon et al 2018a groundwater and produced water samples collected for the rmp were analyzed for a wide array of dissolved organic inorganic and gas constituents water and solute isotopes and age tracers based on the results from the rmp exploratory study conducted in 2014 and 2015 dillon et al 2016 mcmahon et al 2017b the complete list of analytical methods and references used in evaluation of rmp groundwater wells sampled in the area of the orcutt oil field from september 2017 to march 2018 are provided in table s6 for the produced water data presented in this report methods for field processing of samples and laboratory analyses were similar to those used for groundwater samples except that major ions and trace elements in produced water were analyzed by the usgs biogeochemical processes in groundwater laboratory in reston virginia rather than the usgs national water quality laboratory in lakewood colorado a discussion of quality control qc data collected for this study are reported in mccarlson et al 2021 and seitz et al 2021 additional description of sample collection and analysis is provided in the supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial distribution of groundwater chemistry 3 1 1 salinity tracers tds cl br nh3 and doc measured concentrations of total dissolved solids tds bromide br and their ratios relative to chloride cl concentrations along with total ammonia nh3 and dissolved organic carbon doc for some groundwater samples collected as part of the rmp or 2 3 13 are consistent with being mixtures of native groundwater and a smaller fraction of water similar in composition to that from oil producing formations however variability in results between the different salinity tracers for some samples suggests the possibility of more complex mixtures of different sources of oil field water collins 1975 or a naturally brackish source groundwater samples with tds concentrations of between 1000 and 3000 mg l occur within the boundary of the orcutt oil field in relative proximity to historical dense oil development within the san antonio creek valley groundwater basin to the southwest and to the south along san antonio creek and in some agricultural areas surrounding the oil field compared with most groundwater in the study area having tds 1000 mg l fig s6 historical produced water chemistry data indicate water from oil producing formations had tds concentrations of 4000 to 82 400 mg l median 19 900 mg l fig s7 values of tds in groundwater overlying or 2 3 and adjacent or 13 to the oil field may be consistent with some amount of mixing with water from oil producing formations although there are other water sources that could produce similar compositions ratios of br cl for rmp groundwater samples range from 2 4 10 3 to 6 2 10 3 median 3 3 10 3 fig 3 ratios of br cl in groundwater close to the seawater value of 3 48 10 3 davis et al 1998 or only slightly elevated reflect cl and br derived from local precipitation originating from the nearby ocean and not from the redissolution of evaporative salts preferentially enriched in cl relative to the slightly more soluble br jones et al 1999 for rmp water samples from oil producing formations br cl ratios range from 3 9 10 3 to 5 7 10 3 median 4 7 10 3 br cl ratio for or 13 6 2 10 3 located adjacent to the oil field appears to be enriched in br and cl and suggest these values could be derived from mixing of oil bearing formation water with native groundwater fig 3 although br cl ratios greater than seawater also have been associated with other sources such as landfills in some settings mullaney et al 2009 intermediate br cl ratios for or 2 4 0 10 3 and or 3 3 7 10 3 suggest water from oil bearing formations could be a source of br to groundwater overlying the oil field although the variability of br cl ratios of oil bearing formations means that br cl ratios are not conclusive fig 3 the highest nh3 concentration of 28 mg l as n was in rmp groundwater sample or 13 located adjacent to the oil field concentrations of nh3 in the remaining rmp groundwater samples ranged from 0 01 1 06 mg l as n fig 4 doc concentrations in groundwater collected as part of the rmp ranged from 0 14 to 4 4 mg l the highest doc concentrations were measured in groundwater samples adjacent to or 13 and overlying or 2 3 the oil field whereas groundwater samples away from the oil field had doc concentrations 1 0 mg l fig 4 possible explanations for the high nh3 and doc concentration in these groundwater samples or 2 3 13 could be n bearing matter in the reducing environment provided by aquifer sediments with appreciable organic matter harkness et al 2014 and or mixing between groundwater and small amounts of oil bearing formation waters with much higher nh3 and doc concentrations it is implausible that the high nh3 and doc concentration at or 13 could be from reduction of no3 in irrigation water recharge by interaction with organic matter because the groundwater is too old to contain modern recharge see next section additional constituents including major ion chemistry additional salinity tracers including iodide i stable isotopes of water δ2h and δ18o and volatile organic compounds vocs were evaluated but did not show consistent evidence of mixing of substantial quantities of water from oil producing formations in groundwater these results are discussed in the supplementary information 3 1 2 apparent groundwater ages the range of tritium 3h and carbon 14 14c age tracer values indicates that 12 of the 15 rmp groundwater samples were premodern recharged prior to 1953 similar to results in historical data collected from the study area see supplementary information fig s11 tritium was detected at 0 2 tritium units tu in three samples or 4 5 6 indicating traces of groundwater recharged after 1953 mixed with water containing premodern 14c values 14c 75 modern carbon pmc sites or 2 3 and 13 all had premodern aged groundwater or 13 appears to have some of the oldest groundwater in the study area with an uncorrected 14c activity of 2 8 pmc the older apparent groundwater ages are also the groundwater samples with enriched δ13c dic fig 5 for or 12 the slightly enriched δ13c dic value may reflect the addition of dic by the dissolution of calcite or dolomite along the groundwater flow path in contrast much greater enrichment of δ13c dic in or 13 is more likely from input of older sedimentary organic carbon to the dic via methanogenesis mixing between groundwater and oil bearing formation water with much heavier δ13c dic values and or degradation of organic carbon derived from oil bearing formations fig 5 a lack of δ13c values for many of the carbon sources e g organic matter dic in soil water and surface water and calcite from the soils or aquifers and the absence of a consistent relation between δ13c dic values and 14c activities complicates any correction for 14c radioactive decay to obtain a true groundwater age in elapsed time since recharge years and suggests quantitative interpretation of groundwater age based solely on 14c would be problematic however a recent analysis of 3h 4he and 14c data indicate the water from or 3 and or 13 could be 1000 years old mcmahon et al 2021 additional discussion on the use of age tracer data 3h 14c to classify groundwater ages is presented in the supplementary information 3 1 3 light hydrocarbon gas groundwater samples within the boundary of the orcutt oil field had methane ch4 c1 concentrations of 41 mg l or 2 and 22 mg l or 3 reflecting supersaturated and slightly undersaturated conditions respectively relative to equilibrium methane solubility in water at observed temperatures and pressures methane solubility in water equals 22 7 mg l at 25 c and 1 atm haynes 2016 fig 6 these samples also contained ethane c2h6 c2 and propane c3h8 c3 in concentrations of 0 12 and 1 6 10 3 mg l or 2 and 2 8 10 2 and 1 2 10 3 mg l or 3 respectively in addition traces of isobutane c4h10 c4 were also detected in these two samples 5 0 10 4 and 3 0 10 4 mol respectively mccarlson et al 2021 the presence of propane and trace amounts of isobutane indicate a thermogenic source is contributing hydrocarbon gas to these samples the groundwater sample located adjacent to the oil field had methane and ethane concentrations of 47 and 6 1 10 2 mg l or 13 fig 6 methane and ethane were detected at 4 other groundwater samples located near the oil field in concentrations of 0 4 and 3 4 10 3 mg l or 5 0 19 and 2 0 10 3 mg l or 4 2 4 10 3 and 6 1 10 4 mg l or 14 and 2 0 10 3 and 4 7 10 4 mg l or 8 respectively fig 6 microbial methane generally occurs in aquifers with low oxygen and low sulfate concentrations both 0 5 mg l chapelle et al 1995 mcmahon and chapelle 2008 while all these samples with elevated methane concentrations have dissolved oxygen concentrations 0 5 mg l the sulfate concentrations up to 619 mg l are high relative to aquifer conditions typically conducive to microbial methane production despite the high sulfate conditions methanogenesis is still a potential source of methane because the wells in question likely allow for a mixture of water from more than one oxidation reduction zone in the wellbore during sampling mcmahon and chapelle 2008 methane was detected in the remaining orcutt groundwater samples collected for the rmp at concentrations ranging from 2 0 10 4 to 6 3 10 3 mg l while produced water samples had methane concentrations that ranged from 0 9 to 100 mg l mccarlson et al 2021 seitz et al 2021 the δ2h ch4 and δ13c ch4 values for 5 groundwater samples that had methane concentrations high enough for isotopic analysis 0 05 mg l ranged from 62 16 to 33 59 per mil and 221 7 to 71 5 per mil respectively fig 7a using the classification provided by whiticar 1986 and considering microbial methane tends to exhibit depleted δ13c ch4 values in the range of 60 to 90 per mil taylor et al 2000 the methane isotopic values for the two groundwater samples overlying the oil field and in relative proximity to historical dense oil development or 2 3 suggest the source of the methane in these wells is mixed microbial thermogenic in origin fig 7a b furthermore the lack of δ13c dic enrichment in or 2 and or 3 fig 5 despite the high methane concentrations is not consistent with in situ methanogenesis and instead suggests the methane is sourced from outside the shallow aquifer overlying the oil field for the groundwater sample collected adjacent to the oil field or 13 the methane isotopic values suggest the source of the methane is microbial fig 7a b the higher concentration of methane at this site in comparison with other sites with microbial methane fig 7b in combination with the isotopically lightest methane figs 6 7a may reflect co2 reduction in water from oil bearing formations recall the groundwater sample adjacent to the oil field or 13 exhibits an anomalously enriched δ13c dic value fig 5 which suggests the methanogenic activity supported by a high doc concentration in this sample could be why the microbial methane is so much higher in this sample compared to other sites with microbial methane two of the 5 groundwater samples or 2 and or 13 contained enough ethane for isotopic analysis and the δ13c c2h6 values appear to be characteristic of thermogenic ethane figs 6 7c the measured δ13c c2h6 values of 28 6 per mil or 2 and 27 4 per mil or 13 are similar to those measured in the produced water samples and are much heavier than values for microbial ethane described by taylor et al 2000 fig 7c for the other groundwater samples that had methane concentrations high enough for isotopic analysis or 4 5 the combination of δ13c ch4 δ2h ch4 and c1 c2 c3 molar ratios suggest the methane is microbial in origin and has undergone various amounts of methane oxidation rather than being derived from thermogenic sources fig 7a d microbially mediated methane oxidation favors isotopically light methane thus methane oxidation causes 13c enrichment in the residual methane which could shift light δ13c ch4 values in microbial gas toward heavier δ13c ch4 values more characteristic of thermogenic gas schoell 1980 whiticar 1999 historical groundwater samples collected in the san antonio creek groundwater basin during 2017 indicate methane was widely detected in wells 12 out of 27 sites sampled with concentrations of 0 09 to 0 34 mg l at three sites to the south of the orcutt oil field fig 6 although no other hydrocarbon gas concentration or isotopic data were measured in the san antonio creek valley groundwater basin prior to this study similarity to rmp samples outside the boundary of the oil field indicates microbial methane is sometimes present at concentrations up to about 0 4 mg l and is widespread in groundwater at concentrations ranging from about 8 0 10 4 to 7 0 10 3 mg l 3 1 4 noble gas compositions the isotopes of the atmospherically derived noble gases 20ne 36ar 84kr and 132xe were analyzed to identify groundwater that has interacted with oil and gas sources deep crustal or mantle sources has excess atmospheric gases indicating recent atmospheric exposure or has been affected by gas water partitioning processes during groundwater flow through aquifers hunt et al 2012 darrah et al 2014 karolytė et al 2021 the majority of samples reflect air equilibration with entrainment of excess air however two groundwater samples located overlying the oil field or 2 3 and to a lesser extent one groundwater sample adjacent to the oil field or 13 exhibited deviations from asw air saturated water values values of 20ne 36ar versus 132xe 36ar normalized to the asw values exhibit depletion of the lighter noble gases along with enrichment of the heavier noble gases in or 2 or 3 and or 13 fig 8a and indicate these groundwaters may have been affected by degassing preferentially stripping the lighter noble gases out of the groundwater these samples also contained mixed thermogenic microbial methane or ethane and elevated 4he and chloride concentrations suggesting a mixture of thermogenic gas and water from oil bearing formations with native groundwater the stripping of the lighter noble gases along with enrichment in crustal fluids and gases 4he cl and mixed microbial thermogenic ch4 or c2h6 provide evidence for two phase migration during transport of thermogenic gas and water from oil bearing formations into the shallow aquifer system overlying and possibly adjacent to the orcutt oil field furthermore the age tracer data 14c in these samples and elevated 4he concentrations suggest the groundwater has been isolated from the atmosphere for some time thousands to tens of thousands of years before present fig 8b and as such the high chloride concentrations are unlikely the result of a surface spill the remaining groundwater samples exhibited concentrations and isotopic compositions of noble gases in combination with age tracer data consistent with ancient likely thousands of years old groundwater in equilibrium with atmospheric gases from recharge with minor amounts of excess air bubble entrainment and trace amounts of in situ produced 4he fig 8a b these results indicate no evidence for groundwater interaction with water oil or thermogenic gas from oil bearing formations in the majority of samples collected as part of the rmp additional discussion on the evidence for light noble gas degassing in the orcutt groundwater samples is presented in the supplementary information 3 2 relevant indicators of oil bearing formation water and thermogenic gas in groundwater comparison of salinity tracers tds cl and br nh3 doc and δ13c dic values in groundwater and oil field water in the area of the orcutt oil field indicated up to three groundwater samples adjacent to or 13 and overlying the oil field or 2 3 in decreasing order of likelihood may be mixed with oil bearing formation water other water sources similar in composition or more complex mixtures of different sources of relatively brackish water the well adjacent to the oil field or 13 appeared to contain groundwater mixed with oil bearing formation water based on having the highest measured groundwater values of salinity tracers tds cl br nh3 and doc intermediate between most groundwater values and oil producing formation water the enriched δ13c dic isotopes and high methane concentrations for this groundwater sample adjacent to the oil field or 13 cannot be explained solely by inorganic carbonate reactions aravena et al 1995 and suggests that the δ13c dic values are influenced by methanogenesis supported by organic carbon derived from oil bearing formation water and or mixing between groundwater and oil bearing formation waters with much heavier δ13c dic values finally the presence of thermogenic ethane as indicated by a δ13c c2h6 value of 27 4 per mil is consistent with a mixture of native groundwater with some deeper water similar in composition to oil bearing formation water the absence of other indicators of thermogenic hydrocarbon gas in this sample e g propane could indicate the thermogenic component is very small and or the heavier hydrocarbon gases have been oxidized concentrations of tds cl br and doc in the two wells overlying the oil field or 2 and or 3 were intermediate between most groundwater and oil bearing formation water potentially indicating mixing but concentrations were lower than those in or 13 adjacent to the oil field and not all tracers e g i δ18o h2o unambiguously indicate mixing with an oil bearing formation water a possible explanation is that these samples are complex mixtures that include oil bearing formation water of variable composition and or other sources of naturally brackish groundwater near the oil field the presence of thermogenic gas in or 2 and or 3 overlying the oil field is indicated by elevated 4he concentrations enriched methane isotopes detection of c3 c5 gas and hydrocarbon gas ratios the presence of thermogenic gas in or 2 is further indicated by enriched ethane isotopes for or 13 the presence of thermogenic gas adjacent to the oil field is indicated by slightly elevated 4he concentrations and enriched ethane isotopes relative to microbial ethane fig 7c it is important to note that detections of thermogenic gas in groundwater are not by themselves an indication of groundwater quality degradation associated with oil and gas sources instead these gas detections are an indicator that there are potential pathways connecting groundwater to hydrocarbon sources whether in oil production zones or non producing geologic sources near groundwater wells methane and other light hydrocarbon gases are not regulated drinking water constituents posing any known health risk and the presence of these gases does not indicate degraded water quality although the presence of these gases in high concentrations may represent an explosion hazard in confined spaces in some cases eltschlager et al 2001 the three groundwater samples that appear to be influenced by water from oil bearing formations had concentrations of chloride higher than the recommended 250 mg l secondary maximum contaminant level california state water resources control board 2019 created to ensure that water does not cause undesirable aesthetic effects in drinking water although groundwater from these wells is not used for drinking water 3 3 potential sources pathways for water and thermogenic gas from oil bearing formations the presence of elevated concentrations of 4he and mixed microbial thermogenic methane in two water wells directly overlying the orcutt oil field and completed at shallower depths than the oil producing formations or 2 and or 3 along with thermogenic ethane present in or 2 may indicate thermogenic gas migration along natural flow paths through formations or faults if present or could follow anthropogenic pathways such as compromised wells wellbores potentially influenced by oil field development activities that may affect lateral and vertical pressure gradients migration of stray gas from oil field formations has been implicated as a source of methane and to a lesser extent ethane observed in groundwater in other oil producing regions jackson et al 2013b sherwood et al 2016a and 2016b whyte et al 2021 but have been attributed to both anthropogenic and natural pathways and processes likewise the enrichment in 4he and mixed microbial thermogenic methane without the corresponding increase in salinity tracers could potentially result from natural oil and gas shows within the aquifer sediments in oil bearing formations overlying the zones where commercial oil extraction occurs other chemical and isotopic data previously discussed tds cl br nh3 doc and δ13c dic do not indicate definitive evidence that oil bearing formation water has mixed with groundwater being tapped by these wells although small amounts of mixing could be indicated by the data although there is not enough information to determine specific sources of thermogenic gas to nearby rmp sampled groundwater wells there are potential anthropogenic pathways located in proximity to some groundwater wells with detections of thermogenic gas review of available records and data described below indicate that potential pathways exist in places between oil production and groundwater zones these conditions could allow upward movement of water and or thermogenic gas from oil zones into overlying groundwater we examined several factors including the distance and characteristics of the nearest oil well the well status the depth of wells used for oil production and injection depth to base of freshwater well integrity issues the presence of oil and gas shows in sediments overlying the orcutt oil field and the 1977 2017 vol of injection for enhanced recovery and produced water disposal in proximity to rmp sampled groundwater wells of the 15 oil wells within 500 m of rmp sampled groundwater wells specifically or 2 3 5 9 11 approximately 87 of the wells were classified as plugged and abandoned 7 wells abandoned before 1976 whereas new active or idle wells made up the remaining 13 fig s5 table s2 groundwater wells or 2 and or 3 have 10 and 8 oil wells located within 500 m respectively 6 of the 12 oil wells within 500 m of either water well were constructed and plugged and abandoned before 1976 tables s2 s3 as an example the closest oil well api 08302063 to or 2 is 76 m away and has potential pathways and historical observations of leakage tables s2 s3 that oil well was drilled in 1906 to a total depth of 1133 9 m with no record of cement in the borehole annulus above 716 m and was plugged and abandoned in 1946 with damaged casing below 99 m and cement plugs installed above that depth table s3 site inspections related to new planned infrastructure in 2008 noted water seeping around the outside of the heavily corroded casing california department of conservation 2020b among the oil and gas wells within 500 m of the rmp sampled groundwater wells well reports california department of conservation 2020b were reviewed to assess the occurrence of reported well integrity issues including casing damage or collapse at depth well construction integrity issue and water or gas leaks around the casing or from the wellhead at the surface surface expression of the 15 oil wells six had well integrity issues at depths potentially intersecting the groundwater resource zone these included one well with a well construction integrity issue one well with a surface expression and four wells with both well construction integrity issues and surface expressions table s3 all six of these wells were installed during 1901 1907 and plugged and abandoned between 1946 and 2012 well construction integrity issues also were noted in four of the oil wells at depths within oil and gas producing zones below fresh groundwater however three of these wells had cement in the wellbore annulus and or cement plugs installed in the casing during well abandonment in overlying zones indicating that well integrity issues in producing zones would be unlikely to provide a potential transport pathway to groundwater the cement distributions in overlying zones in the fourth well were not recorded table s3 the losses of water or gas from target zones during the installation and development of injection and production wells have been noted in other cases outside of those reported within 500 m of sampled water wells but have not been systematically documented across the field the magnitude of these subsurface releases is unknown a connection between the thermogenic methane and or water from oil bearing formations in groundwater wells and nearby oil wells with possible integrity issues cannot be ruled out or conclusively established another potential source pathway for thermogenic gas are oil and gas shows that naturally occur in places in sediments overlying the orcutt oil field analysis of 33 mud logs within the administrative boundary of the oil field indicates that shallow oil and gas shows are present in sediments at shallow depths overlying the oil field in upland portions of the field where oil zones are closest to land surface table s4 figs 2 9a b at these locations oil and gas shows can occur at depths of as little as 16 8 m below land surface bls and 15 2 m bls respectively in some upland areas table s4 fig 9a b in the closest mud log to or 2 and or 3 the first appearance of oil and gas shows are reported api 08322543 at elevations of 220 and 258 m respectively compared with top of perforation elevations for or 2 and or 3 of 147 and 165 m respectively located 912 m to the south it is presumed that oil gas shows in mud logs reflect the natural distribution over geologic time and not redistribution following oil development activities and that oil bearing formation water would co occur with oil gas shows the sampled wells or 2 and or 3 are located within an alluvial valley incised into the sometimes oil bearing basal layer of the careaga formation and the underlying sisquoc formation kuuskraa et al 1987 which generally dip to the south fig s3 california department of conservation 1992 although the density of the data is low it is possible that the occurrence of thermogenic gas and oil bearing formation water in groundwater at these sites may reflect lateral or vertical transport of these constituents from geologic sources oil bearing formations in the oil bearing sediments overlying the oil field mixtures of oil bearing formation water with groundwater are indicated for sample or 13 collected from outside the boundary of the oil field groundwater age tracers 3h and 14c indicate the groundwater was at least recharged prior to 1953 and is likely ancient 3h not detected 14c 2 8 pmc the notion of ancient groundwater existing adjacent to the oil field is further supported by noble gas data 4he 4 05 10 7 cm3 stp g where stp is standard temperature and pressure and may preclude a historical produced water disposal pond or dump site from being the source of the oil bearing formation water instead potential sources pathways for oil bearing formation water include lateral movement from nearby oil fields orcutt or casmalia to the west along natural flow paths through formations or faults or anthropogenic pathways such as wells wellbores which may may not be influenced by oil field development activities such as injection however the nearest oil wells are located 470 m away from or 13 and areas of dense oil wells and injections are located almost 1000 m to the east fig 2 table s2 another possible source pathway for oil bearing formation water to groundwater is unidentified oil and gas shows in the aquifer adjacent to the oil field however the absence of mud logs and oil exploration test holes means there are no data for assessing shallow oil and gas occurrence in this area but that previous oil exploration did not regard this area as target for economic quantities of hydrocarbons finally the areas of the orcutt oil field having the highest injection volumes co located with plugged and abandoned wells are in the northern part of the field fig 2 these areas may have the highest risk of water gas and oil from oil bearing formations reaching overlying zones because of the absence of groundwater wells in these areas the effects of these factors if any cannot be evaluated without additional data additional discussion on the movement of water from oil producing formations to groundwater along potential anthropogenic or natural pathways is presented in the supplementary information 3 4 multiple lines of evidence for oil bearing formation water and or thermogenic gas in groundwater identification of the presence of oil bearing formation water and thermogenic gas in some groundwater wells required the use of analytes with little or no historical data including light hydrocarbon gas concentration and isotopic data carbon isotopic values of dissolved inorganic carbon dissolved organic carbon groundwater age tracers and noble gases these analyses provide multiple lines of evidence for the presence of oil bearing formation water and or thermogenic gas in three of the 15 groundwater wells sampled other groundwater samples collected as part of the rmp along with available historical data showed no evidence of mixing with water from oil bearing formations results of the groundwater sampling to investigate the occurrence of water and thermogenic gas from oil bearing formations in groundwater are summarized in table s7 in two wells available for sampling within the boundary of the orcutt oil field and in relative proximity to historical dense oil development or 2 and or 3 the following relevant indicators of water and gas from oil bearing formations detected in groundwater near the orcutt oil field were 1 thermogenic light hydrocarbon gas ch4 c2h6 c3h8 mixed with microbial ch4 2 elevated concentrations of tds and cl minor ion ratios br cl nh3 and doc potentially indicating small amounts of oil bearing formation water present and 3 depletion of lighter noble gases and enrichment of heavier noble gases in these samples particularly or 2 indicating the sampled groundwater has been affected by gas migration independent of water movement the source and pathways of the thermogenic gas in groundwater at these wells cannot be determined conclusively from the available data possibilities include 1 upward movement from underlying oil and gas producing formations along a natural flow paths through formations or faults or b anthropogenic pathways such as wells wellbores and or influenced by oil field development activities such as injection and 2 oil and gas shows that occur in water bearing sediments overlying the orcutt oil field at or 13 elevated concentrations of tds cl nh3 and doc minor ion ratios br cl and i cl and enriched δ13c dic and δ13c c2h6 values are consistent with mixing of oil bearing formation water and thermogenic gas from a subsurface source but could also be partially explained by old brackish groundwater interacting with aquifer sediments in a reducing environment with appreciable nitrogen and organic matter undetectable tritium low uncorrected 14c activity 2 8 pmc and noble gas ratios indicate the groundwater is ancient although there is historical evidence of legacy disposal of produced water in surface ponds affecting groundwater in this area enviromanagement inc 2016a 2016b the age tracer and noble gas data are incongruent with or 13 being affected by a surface pond source 3 5 limitations and uncertainties the initial phase of the rmp uses existing infrastructure to achieve coverage across many oil field areas in california as a result sampling locations and depths for more precise determination of pathways were non ideal and limited by the small number of wells available for sampling groundwater overlying and near the edge of the orcutt oil field due to the low sampling density a definitive analysis of relations to potential anthropogenic and natural explanatory factors was not possible as a result the sources and pathways of the thermogenic light hydrocarbon gas and or water from oil bearing formations detected in some groundwater wells overlying and near the orcutt oil field cannot be confirmed at present in order to further evaluate the source and pathways at local scales we suggest 1 a higher density of groundwater observational data located at various vertical and horizontal distances from oil and gas production including water sample data and analysis of available temperature and borehole resistivity data which are available in some areas of oil development where groundwater wells are absent 2 additional data on potential end member compositions including oil production zones and samples from discrete depths where oil and gas shows in aquifer sediments overlying the zones of oil production occur 3 additional data collection and analysis to determine pressure gradients between oil production and groundwater zones and their relations to groundwater withdrawals and oil and gas reservoir production and injection and 4 expanded analysis of oil well seals across the oil field to document the incidence of potential pathways a more detailed description of suggested future analysis is provided in the supplementary information 4 conclusions the california state water resources control board in cooperation with the u s geological survey implemented the oil and gas regional monitoring program rmp near the orcutt oil field to address concerns about groundwater quality in regions of oil and gas development activities the findings of this study indicate most groundwater in the area of the orcutt oil field appears to be of good quality with respect to the constituents analyzed since most groundwater samples as well as available inorganic historical chemistry data showed no indication of water from oil bearing formations in groundwater these results support previous water quality studies which have noted irrigation return flow natural occurring water rock interaction and lateral seepage from the surrounding outcrops of marine rocks are the predominant processes contributing to the salinity in groundwater in the study area the chemical and isotopic composition of three of the 15 groundwater samples obtained as part of the study indicated potential mixing with water and or hydrocarbon gas from oil bearing formations the relevant indicators used to identify the presence of oil bearing formation water and thermogenic gas in groundwater included three or more of the following 1 elevated salinity tracers tds cl br nh3 and doc 2 enriched δ13c dic values 3 higher methane concentrations with trace amounts of propane and isobutane 4 δ2h ch4 and δ13c ch4 values intermediate between thermogenic hydrocarbon and microbial gas 5 δ13c c2h6 values consistent with a thermogenic source and 6 depletion of light noble gases relative to heavier noble gases in combination with elevated 4he concentrations the potential sources pathways for the occurrence of water and thermogenic gas in groundwater near the orcutt oil field included 1 upward movement from oil producing formations due to a anthropogenic activity such as injection and or movement along leaky wells wellbores or b natural migration through formations and or faults and 2 non producing oil bearing formations overlying and adjacent to the oil field determination of oil field sources and pathways affecting groundwater were limited by the small number of wells available in areas of oil development future insight on sources and pathways for thermogenic gas and water from oil bearing formations could be provided by denser data on groundwater and potential end member compositions from new and existing wells analysis of borehole temperature and resistivity data and assessments of the potential for upwelling of water and thermogenic hydrocarbon gas from vertical

7964,at the nikanotee fen watershed a pioneering reclamation project in the athabasca oil sands region elevated sodium na in the porewater of mine waste materials has been shown to migrate to the fen through groundwater likely influencing fen vegetation health given the potential of na to steer the ecological development of the fen the goal of this research is to quantify the spatial distribution of na and to characterize the na mass balance of the surface and shallow subsurface of the fen for a given time the highest na concentrations were generally found in the wettest part of the fen in the southwestern corner and the lowest in the relatively dry northeast corner near the drainage outlet na concentrations in ponded surface water were responsive to rainfall induced dilution and evapoconcentration whereas porewater salinity in shallow groundwater was insensitive to meteorological conditions surface discharge controlled the mass efflux of na from the system at an estimated average rate of 4 kg day 1 between june and august given the relatively small proportion of salt being flushed annually and the greater rate of mass inflow relative to export elevated salinity will likely be sustained for several decades since elevated na concentrations are impacting the rooting zone of vegetation and have exceeded the salinity stress threshold of mosses targeting salt tolerant vegetation will be important to maintain carbon accumulation in constructed systems graphical abstract ga1 keywords sodium transport constructed wetland evapoconcentration peatland reclamation athabasca oil sands region 1 introduction fen peatlands comprise a large proportion 50 of the pre disturbance landscape in the athabasca oil sands region aosr of northern alberta vitt et al 1996 landscape scale disturbance of fens by oil sands mining prompted the construction of the nikanotee fen watershed nfw a pilot project designed to assess the feasibility of returning fen ecohydrological function to the post mined landscape by replicating the hydrogeomorphic setting of a fen upland system ketcheson et al 2016 price et al 2010 the goals of the nfw are to create a self sustaining peat accumulating ecosystem resilient to normal climatic variability and capable of maintaining a high and stable water table in the fen ketcheson et al 2016 prior studies have shown that the system is functioning in accordance with the design ketcheson et al 2017 whereby the fen receives groundwater from the upland aquifer to maintain the requisite hydrological conditions that support peatland processes the upland aquifer was constructed with coarse tailings sand an abundant byproduct of oil sands mining that contains elevated concentrations of na initial concentration of 525 mg l 1 found in the oil sand process affected water which may be harmful to fen vegetation rezanezhad et al 2012 pouliot et al 2012 in the nfw sodium enriched groundwater migrates from the tailings sand upland through a high permeability layer underneath the fen and upwards through the peat kessel et al 2018 since the salinity of groundwater from the upland may steer the development and composition of fen vegetation to more salt tolerant species the influence of fen water quality must be considered borkenhagen and cooper 2019 pouliot et al 2012 the timing magnitude and spatial patterns of na at the fen surface is therefore relevant to the success of reclaimed peatlands the spatiotemporal patterns of near surface salinity in the nfw are influenced by the hydrochemical processes that govern the rate of transport from the upland to the fen and the surface processes that can remove redistribute dilute or accumulate sodium surface water movement can ameliorate spatial differences in salinity or mobilize solutes from isolated areas of the fen and is the sole mechanism for removal of sodium from the system sutton 2021 precipitation can temporarily dilute salinity at the surface sumner and belaineh 2005 and can enhance discharge when the water table rises above ground surface ketcheson et al 2017 water lost to the atmosphere by evaporation and transpiration can lead to evapoconcentration of salts kessel et al 2018 biagi et al 2019 which causes solute accumulation in the near surface and can negatively impact vegetation with low salinity tolerance trites and bayley 2009 these processes are inherently dynamic and necessitates fine spatial and temporal sampling to delineate a better understanding of the rates and processes contributing to salinization is required to better manage the water quality of future constructed landscapes sodium distribution within deeper peat 50 150 cm below ground surface bgs has been previously studied kessel et al 2018 yet there has been little research on the dynamics of na in the near surface 30 cm below ground surface where the vast majority of root biomass is located messner 2019 nor at the surface where the greatest spatial and temporal variability is expected therefore the objectives of this research are to 1 characterize the hydrometric conditions and spatiotemporal patterns of na and electrical conductivity ec within surface water and the shallow subsurface of the fen 2 quantify the na mass balance in this zone and 3 provide insight on the hydrological processes governing the movement and variability of na occurring within the fen 2 study site the nikanotee fen watershed 56 56 n 111 25 w is a constructed reclamation system located on a formerly mined area of an oil sands lease approximately 25 km north of fort mcmurray fig 1 nfw was built in late 2012 with a combination of salvaged mine waste and engineered materials the site comprises a fen upland and surrounding reclaimed hillslopes the system design was based on a simplified conceptual understanding of the hydrogeomorphic setting of fen peatlands in the region whereby a hydraulic gradient established between the upland and the fen would provide the peatland with a continuous supply of groundwater price et al 2010 the upland 7 7 ha was constructed with 3 4 m of tailings sand on a 3 basal slope overlain by a 0 3 m layer of a sandy loam reclaimed forest floor soil sutton and price 2020a the system was underlain by a geosynthetic clay liner to limit deep percolation to the underlying regional groundwater flow system and direct groundwater from the upland to the fen the fen 2 3 ha was constructed with 2 m of salvaged sedge peat from a nearby moderate rich donor fen overlying a 0 5 m layer of high permeability petroleum coke the petroleum coke was intended to direct water and solutes underneath the fen peat thus delaying the arrival of solutes at the surface and fully exploiting the adsorptive capacity of the peat daly et al 2012 all materials were placed mechanically with heavy earth moving equipment in the fen this resulted in minor variations in peat surface topography which caused the formation of persistent ponds scarlett and price 2017 the petroleum coke extends 100 m into the upland an area referred to as the transition zone relatively large rainfall events 10 mm within a 24 hour period generated surface runoff from surrounding hillslopes to the southeast east and west that recharge the upland aquifer and ultimately reaches the fen via groundwater kessel et al 2021 ketcheson and price 2016 the only outlet for surface water from the watershed is near the northeast corner of the fen through a discharge control structure hereafter referred to as a spill box evapotranspiration within the fen averaging 3 3 mm day 1 from may 18 to august 31 from 2013 to 2018 and groundwater inflow to the fen from the constructed upland averaging 212 mm year 1 for the same period unpublished data caused predominantly upward flow from the petroleum coke underdrain into the peat profile ketcheson et al 2017 this groundwater inflow is responsible for the observed salinization of the deeper peat reported by kessel et al 2018 3 methods 3 1 hydrometeorological analyses and water balance data for this study were collected between may 18 and august 31 in 2019 106 total days however seasonal ground ice in

station details of the specific methodology can be found in ketcheson et al 2017 a v notch weir was installed upstream of the spill box to measure surface water discharge which was converted to an equivalent depth with respect to the fen area 2 3 ha referred to as fen runoff q surface outflow from the site was estimated using a pressure transducer van essen micro diver water level loggers installed at the weir which recorded every 30 minutes and was calibrated manually and compensated with barometric pressure van essen micro diver barometric loggers to determine a depth discharge relationship although discharge through the weir was often zero a loss of water from the system still occurred due to subsurface seepage from the peat deposit into the spill box as such a minimum discharge of 0 14 l s 1 was assumed to occur at all times a submersible electrical conductivity ec logger hobo fresh water conductivity data logger was installed on july 1 upstream of the flume to monitor surface water ec at 30 minute intervals which was validated with manual ec measurements thermo scientific orion conductivity and temperature probe the pre existing monitoring network of wells and piezometers was used to measure water levels and pressure heads across the fen there were 14 groundwater monitoring nests installed prior to this study each with a well 150 cm total depth and five piezometers targeting depths of 50 90 150 225 and 275 cm bgs all wells and piezometers were constructed using 2 54 cm inner diameter pvc with fully slotted or 20 cm slotted intakes centered at each respective depth hydraulic head at all monitoring locations was measured manually every week in addition the water table was measured every 30 minutes with a pressure transducer van essen micro diver water level loggers installed at the central nest and considered representative of the entire fen due to the planar nature of the water table a water balance for the fen was estimated as units in depth mm 1 p gw aet q s ε where p and groundwater flux gw are water inputs to the fen aet and q are the outputs the difference between the input and the output is equal to the change in storage δs plus a water balance residual ε representing the error term groundwater inflow to the fen was estimated using darcy s law where average vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity in the peat equaled 0

fluctuations in water table considered the loss or gain in storage from ponded water and from the specific yield of peat 0 05 cm3 cm3 scarlett and price 2019 daily flux values were summed over discrete time periods throughout the monitoring period for use in the water balance 3 2 surface and groundwater sampling water samples were collected from ponded surface water and the porewater of the shallow subsurface upper 35 cm of the fen to measure na concentration and ec in addition to the previously mentioned groundwater monitoring network shallow piezometers centered at 30 cm bgs with 10 cm slotted intake and suction lysimeters centered at 10 and 30 cm bgs with 5 cm intakes were installed to extract porewater from the shallow peat profile these were assumed to sample the top 35 cm layer to characterize the na concentration and ec in the outflow water samples were collected at the outlet from the weir to exclusively represent surface waters and below the spill box to represent seepage water for all water samples a conductivity and temperature probe thermo scientific orion attached to a multiparameter meter orion star a325 ph conductivity were used to measure ec and water temperature water samples were then decanted to hdpe containers and stored at 4 c prior to na analysis prior to each sampling period the probe was put in deionized water 1 μs cm to serve as a field blank the surface sampling locations were selected based on the presence of ponded water during the frozen period may 21 there were only 11 ponded water sampling points however in the wettest conditions this increased to 161 points during the monitoring period 56 ec surveys were conducted approximately every 2 days with 8 of these surveys including the collection of surface and subsurface water samples for na analysis the depth of the ponded surface water at each location was measured manually during every ec survey surface water discharge was collected daily with an automated sampler at the weir when there was surface water discharge and spill box teledyne isco 6712 water samples for determining na concentrations were collected approximately once every two weeks from a random selection of 14 34 surface points and all 30 cm bgs piezometers fig 2 sampling events were conducted during the 2019 field season on may 29 june 3 june 17 july 1 july 16 july 31 and august 13 the june 3 and august 13 events coincided with routine water sampling of the entire well and piezometer network across the site and included the deeper fen piezometers at 50 90 and 150 cm bgs sample collection for surface water used a clean 60 ml high density polyethylene vial that were triple rinsed with a full volume of the sample water the piezometers were purged minimum 3 volumes of water in the piezometers at least 24 h prior to water sample collection allowing enough time for recovery the sampling apparatus was flushed thoroughly with deionized water to avoid cross contamination between piezometers suction lysimeter samples model 1900 soil water sampler soil moisture equipment corp and retrofitted tensiometers were collected within 24 h of the surface and piezometer samples and were included in this study to increase sample size and to improve spatial representation of the unsaturated zone due to the high water retention capacity of the peat scarlett and price 2019 suction was applied using a vacuum pump to 75 kpa to obtain the necessary sample volume this process was repeated over two consecutive days samples collected during the second round were added to the same 120 ml bottle and combined with the initial sample 3 3 na concentrations and validation sodium concentrations were measured using an ion specific electrode thermo scientific 8611bnwp sodium combination probe which was calibrated prior to use and after every 2 h with 10 100 and 1 000 mg l 1 na standards to validate the na concentrations measured by the probe a total of 100 randomly selected samples were analyzed by ion chromatography dionex ics 1600 by the biogeochemistry lab in the university of waterloo these samples were filtered through 0 45 µm nitrocellulose filters then diluted by a factor of 10 with deionized water the na concentrations measured by the dionex were then compared with the na concentrations measured by the probe for validation which demonstrated that the sodium concentrations obtained with the probe needed to be adjusted by a factor of 1 2 but had a high coefficient of determination r2 0 97 with an intercept of 0 3 4 statistical analyses and interpolation statistical analyses were performed to determine if na concentrations or ec from multiple categories including spatial surface 10 cm bgs and 30 cm bgs and temporal dry period and wet period were identical or if at least one of the categories was statistically different from those of other categories α 0 05 the tests used included the kruskal wallis and wilcoxon rank sum test the kruskal wallis test is a non parametric test that assesses whether statistically significant differences exist between multiple groups of variables using the relative rankings within the different samples kruskal and wallis 1952 the wilcoxon rank sum test is a non parametric test used for pairwise comparisons wilcoxon 1945 the lateral spatial patterns of na concentrations and ec were interpolated using a two dimensional cokriging algorithm golden software 2020 for three distinct layers of the fen surface water 10 and 30 cm bgs given that electrical conductivity was relatively well sampled across the fen and there was a high degree of correlation between na concentration and electrical conductivity ec was used as a covariable to provide a better spatial representation of sodium 3 5 mass balance the sodium mass balance in the fen was estimated using two separate approaches by quantifying the changes in na mass through water fluxes into and out of the entire fen and by characterizing the total na mass in the near surface through interpreting changes to concentrations however since these methods integrate the sodium mass balance across different depths the entire thickness of the peat deposit and the shallow subsurface they are not directly comparable to minimize the influence from snowmelt on na concentrations only the samples collected in the frost free period from june 3 to august 13 2019 total of 72 days were used to estimate na mass balance in the top 35 cm of the fen since the mass influx and efflux of sodium from precipitation evapotranspiration and hillslope runoff was negligible the na mass balance for the entire fen was estimated using 2 δ m fen m gw m q where δm fen is the change in na mass kg measured in ponded surface water and subsurface peat between june 3 and august 13 m gw is the na mass influx that enters the fen from groundwater kg and m q is the na efflux that leaves the system through fen runoff kg the fluxes of sodium in groundwater and surface water are further defined as 3 m gw gw c gw a 4 m q q c q where c gw kg m 3 is the harmonic mean na concentration in groundwater measured from piezometers centered at 50 and 225 cm bgs c q kg m 3 is the concentration of na in surface water runoff that was derived from ec measurements collected at 30 minute intervals and a is the area of the petroleum coke under the fen m2 used to convert the linear groundwater flux into a volumetric flux suitable for implementation in the mass balance eq 2 the relationship between ec and na concentration in discharge was validated with 62 sodium samples which demonstrated an adequate correlation r2 0 77 to calculate the mass balance for the near surface the fen was partitioned into an array of 14 cells fig 3 each containing one piezometer a variable number of suction lysimeters at 10 and 30 cm bgs depending on the position of the water table on a given date and a variable number of ponded surface water samples depending on the lateral extent of ponding although there were 8 na sampling events in the field only 6 were used for the mass balance since the earliest sampling date may 29 was influenced by frozen conditions and the july 26 event was missing surface samples for the remaining 6 sampling periods the na mass of the near surface was calculated for each cell in ponded surface water sw unsaturated peat un and saturated peat sat to a

the na mass balance period june 3 to august 13 duration of 72 days see table 1 the 30 year climate normal 1981 2010 mean air temperature and cumulative p were 15 4 c and 229 mm respectively for may 18 to august 31 fort mcmurray airport weather station government of canada 2020 by comparison the 2019 study season between these dates was relatively wet 264 mm total precipitation and cool 14 c average air temperature the nfw received frequent but small p events 10 mm day 1 throughout the study period however the growing season was punctuated by 6 relatively high magnitude events 10 mm day 1 fig 4a in 2019 may 18 to may 31 was defined as a frozen period p 0 7 mm while june 1 to june 27 was a relatively dry period p 46 mm with fewer and smaller precipitation events compared to the rest of the study period june 28 to august 31 was relatively wet p 217 mm with more frequent and larger events fen aet rates ranged from 0 5 to 4 4 mm day 1 averaging 2 6 mm day 1 over the 2019 season with higher daily fluxes in june and july fig 7 discharge was low in the dry period but started to increase as the water table responded to p early in the wet period fig 4c the peak discharge 0 62 l s 1 occurred near the end of the season august 17 coinciding with the largest p event 38 mm on august 16 the water table within the fen was 9 16 cm bgs during the frozen and dry period fig 4b but rose rapidly in response to p events and remained near the surface for the duration of the wet period 1 5 cm above ground surface to 11 cm bgs 4 2 na concentrations and ec distribution generally average na concentrations and ec in the shallow subsurface peat were highest at 10 cm bgs and decreased with depth whereas concentrations at the surface were higher in the dry period and lower in the wet period compared to that at 10 cm bgs fig 5 the median and standard deviation of all na and ec measurements in both the ponded surface water and shallow subsurface peat 35 cm bgs were 277 131 mg l 1 and 2756 1038 µs cm 1 table 2 the na concentrations and ec in surface and groundwater were not normally distributed fig 6 for the three water sampling events in may and june na concentrations within ponded surface water were generally higher than at 10 and 30 cm bgs with a smaller range fig 4c in contrast na concentrations and ec in july and august were generally lower for ponded surface water relative to that at 10 and 30 cm bgs figs 4 and 5 table 3 in 2019 the average na concentration in the upper 35 cm of the fen was 292 mg l 1 however at greater depths average na concentrations in peat at 50 90 and 150 cm bgs were 236 145 and 139 mg l 1 respectively the plan view interpolation maps show the spatial and temporal patterns of 2019 na concentrations in the fen figs 7 and 8 within ponded surface water 10 and 30 cm bgs in 2019 the contour maps show that in ponded surface water 10 and 30 cm bgs na concentrations were generally the highest at the southwest corner where it was consistently the wettest area of the fen with average water table 16 cm ags and lowest at the north and east portion of the fen where it was relatively dry average water table 1 5 cm bgs fig 7 a zone of elevated na appeared in the central part of the fen within ponded surface water and 10 cm bgs and extended towards the spill box figs 7 and 8 temporal patterns in ponded surface water show that na concentrations were higher in the early season dry period with low p high aet and lower water table figs 7 and 8 na concentrations and ec in surface water decreased immediately following the substantial rainfall received in late june and august higher concentrations are consistent with lower precipitation and enhanced evapoconcentration conversely na concentration at 10 and 30 cm bgs remained relatively consistent over time with a slight increase in the wet period figs 4 and 8 as in surface water higher values in the southwest corner and lower values near the discharge point were also observed at 10 and 30 cm bgs sodium concentrations were generally higher during the dry period and lower during the wet period fig 4b and table 2 a rainfall event on june 28 29 mm increased water tables and decreased average na concentrations of ponded surface water however samples collected from 10 and 30 cm bgs did not vary substantially fig 4b between june 17 to july 1 average na concentrations of ponded surface water was highest during the dry period then decreased following multiple p events in late june by 61 from 462 to 181 mg l 1 and 40 from 3 652 to 2 199 μs cm 1 respectively fig 4b in contrast average na concentrations at 10 and 30 cm bgs remained steady from the dry period to the wet period no statistically significant differences as shown in fig 6 unlike na concentrations average ec at 10 and 30 cm bgs increased slightly from the dry period to the wet period data not shown the kruskal wallis test indicated that overall median na concentrations were significantly different between ponded surface water and 10 cm bgs and between 10 and 30 cm bgs whereas there was no significant difference between ponded surface water and 30 cm bgs fig 6 yet overall median ec was significantly different between all three sampling depths surface water 10 cm bgs and 30 cm bgs for ponded surface water samples na concentrations were significantly different between the dry and wet period fig 7 however for water samples within 10 and 30 cm bgs na concentrations were not significantly different between dry and wet periods on the contrary for all three depth categories ec was significantly different between the dry and wet period 4 3 mass balance the na mass balance for the top 35 cm of fen peat between each sampling event period is reported in table 4 average na estimated in the ponded water unsaturated peat and saturated peat top 35 cm of peat layers of the fen were 336 kg 60 kg and 2 309 kg respectively this amounted to a total average na mass in the near surface m upper of 2 705 kg however at any given time there were fluctuations around this mean at the beginning of the season the sampling event conducted on june 3 showed the estimated na mass total was 2 728 kg then gradually decreased to 2 663 kg by the end of the study period except for modest increases on july 1 july 16 and august 13 176 40 and 8 kg respectively table 4 the na mass estimated in the ponded surface water was the lowest in the early season 229 kg on june 3 and higher in the late season 373 kg on july 16 in the unsaturated peat the na mass was higher in june 140 kg and one or two orders of magnitude lower in july and august 2 20 kg in the saturated zone down to 35 cm bgs the highest na mass was found on july 1 2 436 kg and the lowest was found on june 17 2 119 kg the na mass balance as estimated from the hydrological fluxes δm fen showed a net na increase of 14 kg from june 3 to august 13 2019 calculated from total na mass input via groundwater 275 kg and total na mass leaving the system via fen runoff 261 kg table 4 for comparison the estimated change in storage of na δm upper in ponded surface water and subsurface peat for the same period was 66 kg table 4 5 discussion 5 1 spatiotemporal patterns of salinity following the first substantial rainfall event in late june na concentration in ponded surface water decreased considerably from 461 to 181 mg l 1 61 decrease fig 4 calculated algebraically this magnitude of dilution would have only required 53 mm of freshwater details of the calculation can be found in yang 2021 however a total of 68 mm of rainfall was measured while it is possible that this discrepancy reflects sampling uncertainty and error the higher water table and lateral expansion of ponded water could have mobilized salts from adjacent drier areas thus the measured dilution caused by 68 mm of rainfall could have been less than anticipated due to the integration of more saline porewater this is somewhat supported by the partitioning of the 140 kg of sodium in the unsaturated zone entirely to the saturated zone between june 17 and july 1 table 4 furthermore rainfall interception by fen vegetation would have reduced the depth of rainfall incident at the surface of the ponds a short dry period in early july resulted in a modest increase in na concentration at the surface fig 4b following this more frequent and larger magnitude rainfall events caused a further decline in surface concentration 255 mg l 1 to 156 mg l 1 fig 4b however na concentration and ec measured from 10 and 30 cm bgs were much less sensitive to precipitation and evapotranspiration as demonstrated by their consistent spatiotemporal patterns throughout the study period fig 8 this reflects the slow mixing of surface and subsurface water and predominantly upwards hydraulic gradients by the end of july despite considerable rainfall 120 mm evapotranspiration had eliminated the surplus of water fig 7 although the same water deficit existed on june 17 and july 31 the surface sodium concentrations were markedly different with an average of 462 and 255 mg l 1 respectively since the water table in the fen continued to rise throughout this period fig 4b it suggests that groundwater discharge from the deeper peat was diluting the surface despite the fact that the total na mass actually increased between these two periods this is consistent with the observed na and ec profiles fig 5 which shows lower concentrations at depth in the first year post construction 2013 average sodium concentrations in the near surface peat were generally low with an average of 87 mg l 1 kessel et al 2018 and did not exhibit any apparent relationship with depth below ground surface as expected with the material placement practices employed during construction nwaishi et al 2015 therefore spatial variability in salinity during this period reflected initial geochemical heterogeneity in the source material rather than any particular hydrological or geochemical process operating within the fen by 2019 the average na concentration in the upper 35 cm of the fen had increased nearly five fold to 292 mg l 1 however at greater depths average na concentrations in the fen at 50 90 and 150 cm bgs were 236 145 and 139 mg l 1 respectively thus not only had sodium concentrations increased above the initial background salinity of the fen both laterally across the surface and at depth but there was also a trend of increasing na concentrations towards the surface in the fen figs 4 and 5 hydrochemical modelling has shown a similar trend in the fen for 2018 which reflected an increase in surface salinity due to evapoconcentration sutton 2021 yet the observed salinity measured at depth is below the initial average concentration in the tailings sand which modelling indicates is partly a consequence of the initial arrival of relatively fresh water in the petroleum coke from the upland aquifer which has already begun to flush sutton 2021 the areas of highest na concentration and ec were observed near the southwest of the fen both at the surface and at depth whereas lower values were observed near the north and east of the fen fig 7 this could be partially explained by the water table which was above ground surface in the southwest corner for the entire duration of the study period fig 7 and thus evapotranspiration was likely highest there 4 4 mm day 1 scarlett et al 2017 leading to greater evapoconcentration yet the consistent presence of high salinity below the surface in this area which as previously noted was largely unaffected by the surface processes of dilution and evapoconcentration could reflect the dominance of other mechanisms these drivers of spatial variability could include geochemical heterogeneity and the presence of preferential flow paths in the peat however this salinity gradient from south to north could also simply be a consequence of the spatial patterns of groundwater flow from upland to fen across the transition zone and through the petroleum coke fig 1 specifically these nested groundwater flow paths will result in earlier arrival of na near the surface of the fen directly adjacent to the transition zone while the distal areas of the fen northern and western will have later arrival of upland groundwater and generally less effective surface flushing sutton 2021 while evapoconcentration and dilution have spatially heterogeneous impacts on surface concentration due to variability in microtopography vegetation cover and proximity to boundaries these differences appear to be somewhat ameliorated by processes of surface water redistribution this is indicated by the much more abrupt lateral changes in sodium concentration that occur at depth 10 and 30 cm bgs compared to the surface compare figs 7 and 8 5 2 sodium mass balance the initial total sodium mass in the entire system immediately post construction 2013 was estimated at 27 000 kg of which only 600 kg was in the fen peat simhayov et al 2017 by 2019 the sodium mass in the fen was estimated to have increased to 8 800 kg details of the calculation can be found in yang 2021 given an average annual duration of frost free conditions of 183 days sutton and price 2020b and assuming a constant daily rate of mass export equal to that identified in this present study 3 6 kg day 1 surface water discharge has removed over 4 600 kg of sodium or approximately 17 of the total mass within the system however this is likely an overestimation as in the first few years post construction the total mass of na in the near surface of the fen that could be mobilized and exported through surface water discharge was smaller than in 2019 nonetheless based on the change in na mass the average rate of mass transport from the upland into the fen since 2013 the first year of the constructed fen was approximately 10 kg d 1 by 2019 this na influx of sodium had transferred half of the total initial sodium mass in the upland aquifer into the fen peat however most of this na mass in the fen peat 68 was at depths greater than 35 cm nevertheless the na mass in the near surface of the fen has increased substantially in 2015 the estimated na mass in the saturated zone of the upper 70 cm of the fen was approximately 3 000 kg 0 15 kg m 3 of peat in the present study using a similar approach but for the top 35 cm of saturated peat na mass was estimated to be 2 400 kg 0 31 kg m 3 of peat in mid 2019 substantially greater than it was four years previously during the study period upward groundwater flow through the peat of 1 3 mm day 1 brought only 3 8 kg day 1 to the near surface of the fen this suggests that the sodium centre of mass has yet to arrive at the surface of the fen as such the peak sodium concentration in the near surface of the fen can be expected to rise further in the coming years surface water discharge cumulatively removed 261 kg of na over the 72 day mass balance period average of 3 6 kg day 1 in the early season mass export through surface water discharge was low in spite of high near surface na concentration as the growing season progressed near surface salinity was markedly reduced due to dilution by rainfall yet mass export increased towards the end of the season not included in the mass balance two relatively large rainfall events in close succession 38 and 15 mm produced a rapid increase of discharge 0 2 0 6 l s 1 although the na concentration measured in discharge was reduced the higher flow rate resulted in greater loss 116 kg of na mass over 17 days with an average of 6 8 kg day 1 compared to that in the early wet period average of 3 6 kg day 1 this can be attributed to the influence of water table conditions in controlling surface water discharge as the storage capacity of the fen must be exceeded before a meaningful rainfall runoff response could be elicited and therefore appreciable quantities of surface discharge generated thus solute export exhibited a threshold like response to meteorological conditions extrapolating the sodium export rate into the future until all sodium is flushed from the system suggests 36 frost free periods 6 672 days are required however a single season of data from a relatively cool and wet year is not sufficient to predict the flushing timeframe with precision furthermore as sodium mass accumulates in the near surface of the fen the concentration of the discharge water will likely increase and contingent on future climatological and hydrological conditions could result in greater mass export from the system generally the mass transport both into and out of the fen will exhibit an asymptotically diminishing rate in particular desorption from the peat will prolong the longevity of elevated salinity within the fen which may need to be considered when constructed fen systems are placed within the closure landscape the quality of surface water discharge that is passed to downgradient receptors will have a cascading impact on the ecology of these systems 5 3 implications for reclamation by 2019 the magnitude of salt accumulation had exceeded a threshold associated with increased production of labile and mobile dissolved organic carbon by vascular vegetation rooted in the peat prystupa 2020 furthermore the salinity stress threshold identified for a variety of common and relatively salt tolerant mosses bryum pseudotriquetrum and tomenthypnum nitens of 300 mg l 1 pouliot et al 2013 was exceeded across the majority of the fen surface particularly in the early dry period although mosses are desirable in reclamation projects due to their abundance in regional fens chee and vitt 1989 and carbon accumulation potential batzer and baldwin 2012 the current salinity conditions at the surface may limit moss establishment however mosses do not solely respond to average na concentration but also the duration of inundation in saline water pouliot et al 2013 while the sodium concentrations at just 10 cm bgs and deeper were essentially constant over the study period both spatially and temporally the salinity at the surface was highly variable and responded strongly to rainfall induced dilution and evapoconcentration since mosses are non vascular they are disproportionately influenced by the salinity of porewater directly at the surface and thus the temporary depression of surface concentration by rainfall may allow mosses to persist in otherwise hostile geochemical conditions this requires intentional monitoring of geochemistry directly at the surface since the subtleties of dilution were absent from na and ec measurements taken from shallow porewater samplers and piezometers the apparent correlation between water table depth and peak na concentration suggests that future constructed fens could use topographic variability to create diverse geochemical conditions across the surface which may offer a variety of ecological niches where mosses could survive approximating the hummock hollow topography that is characteristic of many boreal peatlands would provide a range of water table depths and allow for vegetation to self design areas where the water table is consistently deeper would experience greater salt flushing during precipitation events and less evapoconcentration during dry periods offering more suitable conditions for less salt tolerant mosses at nfw the microtopography of the peat surface was intentionally reduced however future systems could harness the variability that arises from the deposition and redistribution of peat which would have the added benefit of expediting site construction placing nfw in the context of natural and other reclaimed systems is a crucial step in understanding and anticipating the ecological trajectory of the watershed and ultimately to evaluating the success and feasibility of fen construction as a reclamation technique the design philosophy and materials used in the nfw differ from another constructed fen pilot project in the aosr sandhill fen watershed sfw the design of sfw placed a greater emphasis on bidirectional water sharing between upland and lowland features the central fen of sfw was surrounded by several raised landforms and perched fens which overlies a deposit of composite tailings and fine tailings sand biagi et al 2019 composite tailings have greater pore water concentrations of na in comparison to the coarse tailings sand used in the construction of the nfw aquifer and unlike the nikanotee fen the liner intended to limit groundwater exchange with underlying material did not extend into the upland biagi et al 2021 these design choices in combination with the absence of a natural outflow were identified as primary causes of salt accumulation at the surface of sfw biagi et al 2021 which exceeded 800 mg l 1 within 3 years post construction biagi et al 2019 similar to nfw the highest salinity at sfw was observed at the interface between upland and fen however the peak na concentration was 200 mg l 1 greater than what was measured in this study which was performed 7 years post construction although natural saline wetlands can be found in the region the na concentration at the surface of hypersaline fens can exceed 25 000 mg l 1 wells and price 2015 considering the large discrepancy in surface na concentration between the reclaimed and natural saline fens these natural fens may not be the most appropriate analogue to illustrate fen trajectory as has been proposed wells and price 2015 at least in the first decade post construction 5 4 error and uncertainty while the sample size for the original design of this study was reasonable more confidence in the results would have been possible with a larger sample size and repetitive sampling at randomly selected locations furthermore certain areas of the persistent ponds were inaccessible these areas may have had a stronger and more consistent evaporative signature therefore the surface water readily sampled in the field could bias the results towards a diluted signature additionally surface sampling events for na concentrations were not repeated at the exact same locations nor were the number of collected samples consistent between events water samples collected from discharge were also highly dependent on the water availability na concentration in surface discharge was estimated using logged ec validated with manually collected discharge samples if the water level was below the height of the v notch weir the ec measurement could reflect stagnant water meanwhile seepage water was collected less frequently thus the na mass estimated in discharge might be underestimated thereby contributing error to the na mass balance for the frost free period june 3 to august 13 the water balance showed a net gain of water from hydrological components 38 mm and yet the change in water storage showed an increase of 41 mm with only 3 mm error 8 table 1 which was likely due to measurement error however the na mass balance estimated using the hydrological fluxes of the water balance m fen was 14 kg which was larger than change in na mass storage estimated with concentrations m upper of 66 kg this residual was 80 kg which may be attributed to measurement error in the estimation of na mass export in surface water discharge or the different spatial extents that the mass balance methods were applied specifically the na mass balance based on changes to concentration only considered the near surface of the peat and thus does not consider a possible net gain to sodium in the deeper layers of the fen over the study period the first sampling event of this study was conducted a month after the spring freshet which can be the most important hydrological moment of the year given the considerable depth of snowmelt and the limited infiltration capacity resulting from a high antecedent water table therefore frost table and occluded pores the freshet would cause the highest annual surface water discharge event however the interaction between snowmelt and near surface solutes is unclear particularly because of the presence of seasonal ground ice during the study period it was demonstrated that although rainfall diluted surface salinity and reduced the concentration of surface water discharge the mass export increased during these periods whether this observation is applicable to the spring freshet would largely be contingent on the accessibility of near surface na and whether it can be readily mobilized by surface water movement further studies should specifically look at the spring freshet to determine if this relationship between discharge and mass export is also consistent during the snowmelt period 6 conclusion this study assessed the spatiotemporal patterns transport and export of near surface na within a reclaimed fen 7 years post construction in general na concentration and ec measured in ponded surface water steadily increased due to high evapotranspiration but was sensitive to freshwater inputs rainfall which caused variability in concentration and redistribution between surface ponds na concentration decreased as precipitation introduced fresh water resulting in dilution 61 reduction in na concentration in response to june 28 rainfall and increased as evapotranspiration removed water but not solutes from the system resulting in evapoconcentration however these processes had little influence on na concentration and ec measured at even modest depths 10 cm bgs which not only remained unaffected by dilution but slightly increased over the study period this demonstrates the subtlety of dilution which requires intentional monitoring and consideration in hydrochemical studies or modelling shallow pore water samples did not reflect the dynamic geochemical conditions directly at the surface i e in ponded water while na concentration in ponded water may affect the development of vascular species less than conditions deeper in the rooting zone it has implications for the growth productivity and survival of mosses which typically exhibit low salinity tolerance boerner and forman 1975 given the non vascular nature of bryophytes salinity of water closest to the surface will have the dominant influence on their productivity since mosses are regionally abundant peat forming species in many fens batzer and baldwin 2012 and are targeted for inclusion in reclaimed peatlands the chemistry of surface water should be studied in detail the highest salinity was found near the southwest corner which had the highest average water table and was adjacent to the transition zone in contrast the lowest na concentration and ec were found near the northeast corner where it was relatively dry throughout the study period close to the discharge point of the fen and far from the primary source of salinity upland aquifer a trend of higher na concentration from the centre of the fen towards the discharge point was observed in the surface as a result of lower elevation ponds and surface flow towards the outflow this illustrates the importance of both topography and proximity to process affected materials in influencing near surface geochemistry both of these aspects of system design could be manipulated in future constructed fens to improve the management of salinity and offer a greater variety of geochemical conditions for vegetation to occupy ultimately na from upland tailings sand will migrate to the fen peat and leave the system though discharge the estimated na mass leaving the system was 4 kg day 1 through discharge over the frost free period amounting to 261 kg of export between june and august assuming similar meteorological conditions to those in 2019 the approximate time for complete na export from the nikanotee fen is about 36 years post construction however the actual timeline will vary depending on the prevailing meteorological conditions whereby wetter conditions will result in more rapid export of na continued monitoring of na in surface water discharge beginning prior to the spring freshet is recommended to further illuminate the impact of snowmelt and differing meteorological conditions on surface concentration and sodium mass export furthermore with the outflow being the sole pathway for solute removal from the system monitoring the concentration and rate of sodium removal is relatively easy and summarizes a host of complex hydrochemical processes credit authorship contribution

7964,at the nikanotee fen watershed a pioneering reclamation project in the athabasca oil sands region elevated sodium na in the porewater of mine waste materials has been shown to migrate to the fen through groundwater likely influencing fen vegetation health given the potential of na to steer the ecological development of the fen the goal of this research is to quantify the spatial distribution of na and to characterize the na mass balance of the surface and shallow subsurface of the fen for a given time the highest na concentrations were generally found in the wettest part of the fen in the southwestern corner and the lowest in the relatively dry northeast corner near the drainage outlet na concentrations in ponded surface water were responsive to rainfall induced dilution and evapoconcentration whereas porewater salinity in shallow groundwater was insensitive to meteorological conditions surface discharge controlled the mass efflux of na from the system at an estimated average rate of 4 kg day 1 between june and august given the relatively small proportion of salt being flushed annually and the greater rate of mass inflow relative to export elevated salinity will likely be sustained for several decades since elevated na concentrations are impacting the rooting zone of vegetation and have exceeded the salinity stress threshold of mosses targeting salt tolerant

function to the post mined landscape by replicating the hydrogeomorphic setting of a fen upland system ketcheson et al 2016 price et al 2010 the goals of the nfw are to create a self sustaining peat accumulating ecosystem resilient to normal climatic variability and capable of maintaining a high and stable water table in the fen ketcheson et al 2016 prior studies have shown that the system is functioning in accordance with the design ketcheson et al 2017 whereby the fen receives groundwater from the upland aquifer to maintain the requisite hydrological conditions that support peatland processes the upland aquifer was constructed with coarse tailings sand an abundant byproduct of oil sands mining that contains elevated concentrations of na initial concentration of 525 mg l 1 found in the oil sand process affected water which may be harmful to fen vegetation rezanezhad et al 2012 pouliot et al 2012 in the nfw sodium enriched groundwater migrates from the tailings sand upland through a high permeability layer underneath the fen and upwards through the peat kessel et al 2018 since the salinity of groundwater from the upland may steer the development and composition of fen vegetation to more salt tolerant species the influence of fen water quality must be considered borkenhagen and cooper 2019 pouliot et al 2012 the timing magnitude and spatial patterns of na at the fen surface is therefore relevant to the success of reclaimed peatlands the spatiotemporal patterns of near surface salinity in the nfw are influenced by the hydrochemical processes that govern the rate of transport from the upland to the fen and the surface processes that can remove redistribute dilute or accumulate sodium surface water movement can ameliorate spatial differences in salinity or mobilize solutes from isolated areas of the fen and is the sole mechanism for removal of sodium from the system sutton 2021 precipitation can temporarily dilute salinity at the surface sumner and belaineh 2005 and can enhance discharge when the water table rises above ground surface ketcheson et al 2017 water lost to the atmosphere by evaporation and transpiration can lead to evapoconcentration of salts kessel et al 2018 biagi et al 2019 which causes solute accumulation in the near surface and can negatively impact vegetation with low salinity tolerance trites and bayley 2009 these processes are inherently dynamic and necessitates fine spatial and temporal sampling to delineate a better understanding of the rates and processes contributing to salinization is required to better manage the water quality of future constructed landscapes sodium distribution within deeper peat 50 150 cm below ground surface bgs has been previously studied kessel et al 2018 yet there has been little research on the dynamics of na in the near surface 30 cm below ground surface where the vast majority of root biomass is located messner 2019 nor at the surface where the greatest spatial and temporal variability is expected therefore the objectives of this research are to 1 characterize the hydrometric conditions and spatiotemporal patterns of na and electrical conductivity ec within surface water and the shallow subsurface of the fen 2 quantify the na mass balance in this zone and 3 provide insight on the hydrological processes governing the movement and variability of na occurring within the fen 2 study site the nikanotee fen watershed 56 56 n 111 25 w is a constructed reclamation system located on a formerly mined area of an oil sands lease approximately 25 km north of fort mcmurray fig 1 nfw was built in late 2012 with a combination of salvaged mine waste and engineered materials the site comprises a fen upland and surrounding reclaimed hillslopes the system design was based on a simplified conceptual understanding of the hydrogeomorphic setting of fen peatlands in the region whereby a hydraulic gradient established between the upland and the fen would provide the peatland with a continuous supply of groundwater price et al 2010 the upland 7 7 ha was constructed with 3 4 m of tailings sand on a 3 basal slope overlain by a 0 3 m layer of a sandy loam reclaimed forest floor soil sutton and price 2020a the system was underlain by a geosynthetic clay liner to limit deep percolation to the underlying regional groundwater flow system and direct groundwater from the upland to the fen the fen 2 3 ha was constructed with 2 m of salvaged sedge peat from a nearby moderate rich donor fen overlying a 0 5 m layer of high permeability petroleum coke the petroleum coke was intended to direct water and solutes underneath the fen peat thus delaying the arrival of solutes at the surface and fully exploiting the adsorptive capacity of the peat daly et al 2012 all materials were placed mechanically with heavy earth moving equipment in the fen this resulted in minor variations in peat surface topography which caused the formation of persistent ponds scarlett and price 2017 the petroleum coke extends 100 m into the upland an area referred to as the transition zone relatively large rainfall events 10 mm within a 24 hour period generated surface runoff from surrounding hillslopes to the southeast east and west that recharge the upland aquifer and ultimately reaches the fen via groundwater kessel et al 2021 ketcheson and price 2016 the only outlet for surface water from the watershed is near the northeast corner of the fen through a discharge control structure hereafter referred to as a spill box evapotranspiration within the fen averaging 3 3 mm day 1 from may 18 to august 31 from 2013 to 2018 and groundwater inflow to the fen from the constructed upland averaging 212 mm year 1 for the same period unpublished data caused predominantly upward flow from the petroleum coke underdrain into the peat profile ketcheson et al 2017 this groundwater inflow is responsible for the observed salinization of the deeper peat reported by kessel et al 2018 3 methods 3 1 hydrometeorological analyses and water balance data for this study were collected between may 18 and august 31 in 2019 106 total days however seasonal ground ice in the fen did not thaw until early june thus may is defined as a frozen period from the june 1 until june 27 relatively little precipitation occurred 50 mm total constituting a dry period this was followed by a wet period until the end of august 200 mm total precipitation p was recorded at the upland meteorological station fig 1 using a tipping bucket rain gauge texas instruments canada ltd tr 525 m recording total rainfall at a 30 minute interval a meteorological station in the fen measured air temperature rotronic hc2s3 relative humidity rotronic hc2s3 net radiation kipp and zonen cnr4

campbell scientific canada these meteorological variables were used to derive potential evapotranspiration pet using the penman method penman 1948 on a 30 minute interval and summed for a daily pet rate actual evapotranspiration aet from the fen was estimated using the eddy covariance method li 7500ds open path co2 h2o analyzer li cor biosciences in conjunction with the fen meteorological station details of the specific methodology can be found in ketcheson et al 2017 a v notch weir was installed upstream of the spill box to measure surface water discharge which was converted to an equivalent depth with respect to the fen area 2 3 ha referred to as fen runoff q surface outflow from the site was estimated using a pressure transducer van essen micro diver water level loggers installed at the weir which recorded every 30 minutes and was calibrated manually and compensated with barometric pressure van essen micro diver barometric loggers to determine a depth discharge relationship although discharge through the weir was often zero a loss of water from the system still occurred due to subsurface seepage from the peat deposit into the spill box as such a minimum discharge of 0 14 l s 1 was assumed to occur at all times a submersible electrical conductivity ec logger hobo fresh water conductivity data logger was installed on july 1 upstream of the flume to monitor surface water ec at 30 minute intervals which was validated with manual ec measurements thermo scientific orion conductivity and temperature probe the pre existing monitoring network of wells and piezometers was used to measure water levels and pressure heads across the fen there were 14 groundwater monitoring nests installed prior to this study each with a well 150 cm total depth and five piezometers targeting depths of 50 90 150 225 and 275 cm bgs all wells and piezometers were constructed using 2 54 cm inner diameter pvc with fully slotted or 20 cm slotted intakes centered at each respective depth hydraulic head at all monitoring locations was measured manually every week in addition the water table was measured every 30 minutes with a pressure transducer van essen micro diver water level loggers installed at the central nest and considered representative of the entire fen due to the planar nature of the water table a water balance for the fen was estimated as units in depth mm 1 p gw aet q s ε where p and groundwater flux gw are water inputs to the fen aet and q are the outputs the difference between the input and the output is equal to the change in storage δs plus a water balance residual ε representing the error term groundwater inflow to the fen was estimated using darcy s law where average vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity in the peat equaled 0 1 m day 1 sutton 2021 and average vertical hydraulic gradient during the unfrozen period was 0 013 m m upwards from petroleum coke to water table kessel et al 2018 change in storage due to fluctuations in water table considered the loss or gain in storage from ponded water and from the specific yield of peat 0 05 cm3 cm3 scarlett and price 2019 daily flux values were summed over discrete time periods throughout the monitoring period for use in the water balance 3 2 surface and groundwater sampling water samples were collected from ponded surface water and the porewater of the shallow subsurface upper 35 cm of the fen to measure na concentration and ec in addition to the previously mentioned groundwater monitoring network shallow piezometers centered at 30 cm bgs with 10 cm slotted intake and suction lysimeters centered at 10 and 30 cm bgs with 5 cm intakes were installed to extract porewater from the shallow peat profile these were assumed to sample the top 35 cm layer to characterize the na concentration and ec in the outflow water samples were collected at the outlet from the weir to exclusively represent surface waters and below the spill box to represent seepage water for all water samples a conductivity and temperature probe thermo scientific orion attached to a multiparameter meter orion star a325 ph conductivity were used to measure ec and water temperature water samples were then decanted to hdpe containers and stored at 4 c prior to na analysis prior to each sampling period the probe was put in deionized water 1 μs cm to serve as a field blank the surface sampling locations were selected based on the presence of ponded water during the frozen period may 21 there were only 11 ponded water sampling points however in the wettest conditions this increased to 161 points during the monitoring period 56 ec surveys were conducted approximately every 2 days with 8 of these surveys including the collection of surface and subsurface water samples for na analysis the depth of the ponded surface water at each location was measured manually during every ec survey surface water discharge was collected daily with an automated sampler at the weir when there was surface water discharge and spill box teledyne isco 6712 water samples for determining na concentrations were collected approximately once every two weeks from a random selection of 14 34 surface points and all 30 cm bgs piezometers fig 2 sampling events were conducted during the 2019 field season on may 29 june 3 june 17 july 1 july 16 july 31 and august 13 the june 3 and august 13 events coincided with routine water sampling of the entire well and piezometer network across the site and included the deeper fen piezometers at 50 90 and 150 cm bgs sample collection for surface water used a clean 60 ml high density polyethylene vial that were triple rinsed with a full volume of the sample water the piezometers were purged minimum 3 volumes of water in the piezometers at least 24 h prior to water sample collection allowing enough time for recovery the sampling apparatus was flushed thoroughly with deionized water to avoid cross contamination between piezometers suction lysimeter samples model 1900 soil water sampler soil moisture equipment corp and retrofitted tensiometers were collected within 24 h of the surface and piezometer samples and were included in this study to increase sample size and to improve spatial representation of the unsaturated zone due to the high water retention capacity of the peat scarlett and price 2019 suction was applied using a vacuum pump to 75 kpa to obtain the necessary sample volume this process was repeated over two consecutive days samples collected during the second round were added to the same 120 ml bottle and combined with the initial sample 3 3 na concentrations and validation sodium concentrations were measured using an ion specific electrode thermo scientific 8611bnwp sodium combination probe which was calibrated prior to use and after every 2 h with 10 100 and 1 000 mg l 1 na standards to validate the na concentrations measured by the probe a total of 100 randomly selected samples were analyzed by ion chromatography dionex ics 1600 by the biogeochemistry lab in the university of waterloo these samples were filtered through 0 45 µm nitrocellulose filters then diluted by a factor of 10 with deionized water the na concentrations measured by the dionex were then compared with the na concentrations measured by the probe for validation which demonstrated that the sodium concentrations obtained with the probe needed to be adjusted by a factor of 1 2 but had a high coefficient of determination r2 0 97 with an intercept of 0 3 4 statistical analyses and interpolation statistical analyses were performed to determine if na concentrations or ec from multiple categories including spatial surface 10 cm bgs and 30 cm bgs and temporal dry period and wet period were identical or if at least one of the categories was statistically different from those of other categories α 0 05 the tests used included the kruskal wallis and wilcoxon rank sum test the kruskal wallis test is a non parametric test that assesses whether statistically significant differences exist between multiple groups of variables using the relative rankings within the different samples kruskal and wallis 1952 the wilcoxon rank sum test is a non parametric test used for pairwise comparisons wilcoxon 1945 the lateral spatial patterns of na concentrations and ec were interpolated using a two dimensional cokriging algorithm golden software 2020 for three distinct layers of the fen surface water 10 and 30 cm bgs given that electrical conductivity was relatively well sampled across the fen and there was a high degree of correlation between na concentration and electrical conductivity ec was used as a covariable to provide a better spatial representation of sodium 3 5 mass balance the sodium mass balance in the fen was estimated using two separate approaches by quantifying the changes in na mass through water fluxes into and out of the entire fen and by characterizing the total na mass in the near surface through interpreting changes to concentrations however since these methods integrate the sodium mass balance across different depths the entire thickness of the peat deposit and the shallow subsurface they are not directly comparable to minimize the influence from snowmelt on na concentrations only the samples collected in the frost free period from june 3 to august 13 2019 total of 72 days were used to estimate na mass balance in the top 35 cm of the fen since the mass influx and efflux of sodium from precipitation evapotranspiration and hillslope runoff was negligible the na mass balance for the entire fen was estimated using 2 δ m fen m gw m q where δm fen is the change in na mass kg measured in ponded surface water and subsurface peat between june 3 and august 13 m gw is the na mass influx that enters the fen from groundwater kg and m q is the na efflux that leaves the system through fen runoff kg the fluxes of sodium in groundwater and surface water are further defined as 3 m gw gw c gw a 4 m q q c q where c gw kg m 3 is the harmonic mean na concentration in groundwater measured from piezometers centered at 50 and 225 cm bgs c q kg m 3 is the concentration of na in surface water runoff that was derived from ec measurements collected at 30 minute intervals and a is the area of the petroleum coke under the fen m2 used to convert the linear groundwater flux into a volumetric flux suitable for implementation in the mass balance eq 2 the relationship between ec and na concentration in discharge was validated with 62 sodium samples which demonstrated an adequate correlation r2 0 77 to calculate the mass balance for the near surface the fen was partitioned into an array of 14 cells fig 3 each containing one piezometer a variable number of suction lysimeters at 10 and 30 cm bgs depending on the position of the water table on a given date and a variable number of ponded surface water samples depending on the lateral extent of ponding although there were 8 na sampling events in the field only 6 were used for the mass balance since the earliest sampling date may 29 was influenced by frozen conditions and the july 26 event was missing surface samples for the remaining 6 sampling periods the na mass of the near surface was calculated for each cell in ponded surface water sw unsaturated peat un and saturated peat sat to a

august 13 and june 3 4 results 4 1 hydrometeorology water budget results are reported from may 18 to august 31 duration of 106 days however a shorter water budget is also reported that coincides with the na mass balance period june 3 to august 13 duration of 72 days see table 1 the 30 year climate normal 1981 2010 mean air temperature and cumulative p were 15 4 c and 229 mm respectively for may 18 to august 31 fort mcmurray airport weather station government of canada 2020 by comparison the 2019 study season between these dates was relatively wet 264 mm total precipitation and cool 14 c average air temperature the nfw received frequent but small p events 10 mm day 1 throughout the study period however the growing season was punctuated by 6 relatively high magnitude events 10 mm day 1 fig 4a in 2019 may 18 to may 31 was defined as a frozen period p 0 7 mm while june 1 to june 27 was a relatively dry period p 46 mm with fewer and smaller precipitation events compared to the rest of the study period june 28 to august 31 was relatively wet p 217 mm with more frequent and larger events fen aet rates ranged from 0 5 to 4 4 mm day 1 averaging 2 6 mm day 1 over the 2019 season with higher daily fluxes in june and july fig 7 discharge was low in the dry period but started to increase as the water table responded to p early in the wet period fig 4c the peak discharge 0 62 l s 1 occurred near the end of the season august 17 coinciding with the largest p event 38 mm on august 16 the water table within the fen was 9 16 cm bgs during the frozen and dry period fig 4b but rose rapidly in response to p events and remained near the surface for the duration of the wet period 1 5 cm above ground surface to 11 cm bgs 4 2 na concentrations and ec distribution generally average na concentrations and ec in the shallow subsurface peat were highest at 10 cm bgs and decreased with depth whereas concentrations at the surface were higher in the dry period and lower in the wet period compared to that at 10 cm bgs fig 5 the median and standard deviation of all na and ec measurements in both the ponded surface water and shallow subsurface peat 35 cm bgs were 277 131 mg l 1 and 2756 1038 µs cm 1 table 2 the na concentrations and ec in surface and groundwater were not normally distributed fig 6 for the three water sampling events in may and june na concentrations within ponded surface water were generally higher than at 10 and 30 cm bgs with a smaller range fig 4c in contrast na concentrations and ec in july and august were generally lower for ponded surface water relative to that at 10 and 30 cm bgs figs 4 and 5 table 3 in 2019 the average na concentration in the upper 35 cm of the fen was 292 mg l 1 however at greater depths average na concentrations in peat at 50 90 and 150 cm bgs were 236 145 and 139 mg l 1 respectively the plan view interpolation maps show the spatial and temporal patterns of 2019 na concentrations in the fen figs 7 and 8 within ponded surface water 10 and 30 cm bgs in 2019 the contour maps show that in ponded surface water 10 and 30 cm bgs na concentrations were generally the highest at the southwest corner where it was consistently the wettest area of the fen with average water table 16 cm ags and lowest at the north and east portion of the fen where it was relatively dry average water table 1 5 cm bgs fig 7 a zone of elevated na appeared in the central part of the fen within ponded surface water and 10 cm bgs and extended towards the spill box figs 7 and 8 temporal patterns in ponded surface water show that na concentrations were higher in the early season dry period with low p high aet and lower water table figs 7 and 8 na concentrations and ec in surface water decreased immediately following the substantial rainfall received in late june and august higher concentrations are consistent with lower precipitation and enhanced evapoconcentration conversely na concentration at 10 and 30 cm bgs remained relatively consistent over time with a slight increase in the wet period figs 4 and 8 as in surface water higher values in the southwest corner and lower values near the discharge point were also observed at 10 and 30 cm bgs sodium concentrations were generally higher during the dry period and lower during the wet period fig 4b and table 2 a rainfall event on june 28 29 mm increased water tables and decreased average na concentrations of ponded surface water however samples collected from 10 and 30 cm bgs did not vary substantially fig 4b between june 17 to july 1 average na concentrations of ponded surface water was highest during the dry period then decreased following multiple p events in late june by 61 from 462 to 181 mg l 1 and 40 from 3 652 to 2 199 μs cm 1 respectively fig 4b in contrast average na concentrations at 10 and 30 cm bgs remained steady from the dry period to the wet period no statistically significant differences as shown in fig 6 unlike na concentrations average ec at 10 and 30 cm bgs increased slightly from the dry period to the wet period data not shown the kruskal wallis test indicated that overall median na concentrations were significantly different between ponded surface water and 10 cm bgs and between 10 and 30 cm bgs whereas there was no significant difference between ponded surface water and 30 cm bgs fig 6 yet overall median ec was significantly different between all three sampling depths surface water 10 cm bgs and 30 cm bgs for ponded surface water samples na concentrations were significantly different between the dry and wet period fig 7 however for water samples within 10 and 30 cm bgs na concentrations were not significantly different between dry and wet periods on the contrary for all three depth categories ec was significantly different between the dry and wet period 4 3 mass balance the na mass balance for the top 35 cm of fen peat between each sampling event period is reported in table 4 average na estimated in the ponded water unsaturated peat and saturated peat top 35 cm of peat layers of the fen were 336 kg 60 kg and 2 309 kg respectively this amounted to a total average na mass in the near surface m upper of 2 705 kg however at any given time there were fluctuations around this mean at the beginning of the season the sampling event conducted on june 3 showed the estimated na mass total was 2 728 kg then gradually decreased to 2 663 kg by the end of the study period except for modest increases on july 1 july 16 and august 13 176 40 and 8 kg respectively table 4 the na mass estimated in the ponded surface water was the lowest in the early season 229 kg on june 3 and higher in the late season 373 kg on july 16 in the unsaturated peat the na mass was higher in june 140 kg and one or two orders of magnitude lower in july and august 2 20 kg in the saturated zone down to 35 cm bgs the highest na mass was found on july 1 2 436 kg and the lowest was found on june 17 2 119 kg the na mass balance as estimated from the hydrological fluxes δm fen showed a net na increase of 14 kg from june 3 to august 13 2019 calculated from total na mass input via groundwater 275 kg and total na mass leaving the system via fen runoff 261 kg table 4 for comparison the estimated change in storage of na δm upper in ponded surface water and subsurface peat for the same period was 66 kg table 4 5 discussion 5 1 spatiotemporal patterns of salinity following the first substantial rainfall event in late june na concentration in ponded surface water decreased considerably from 461 to 181 mg l 1 61 decrease fig 4 calculated algebraically this magnitude of dilution would have only required 53 mm of freshwater details of the calculation can be found in yang 2021 however a total of 68 mm of rainfall was measured while it is possible that this discrepancy reflects sampling uncertainty and error the higher water table and lateral expansion of ponded water could have mobilized salts from adjacent drier areas thus the measured dilution caused by 68 mm of rainfall could have been less than anticipated due to the integration of more saline porewater this is somewhat supported by the partitioning of the 140 kg of sodium in the unsaturated zone entirely to the saturated zone between june 17 and july 1 table 4 furthermore rainfall interception by fen vegetation would have reduced the depth of rainfall incident at the surface of the ponds a short dry period in early july resulted in a modest increase in na concentration at the surface fig 4b following this more frequent and larger magnitude rainfall events caused a further decline in surface concentration 255 mg l 1 to 156 mg l 1 fig 4b however na concentration and ec measured from 10 and 30 cm bgs were much less sensitive to precipitation and evapotranspiration as demonstrated by their consistent spatiotemporal patterns throughout the study period fig 8 this reflects the slow mixing of surface and subsurface water and predominantly upwards hydraulic gradients by the end of july despite considerable rainfall 120 mm evapotranspiration had eliminated the surplus of water fig 7 although the same water deficit existed on june 17 and july 31 the surface sodium concentrations were markedly different with an average of 462 and 255 mg l 1 respectively since the water table in the fen continued to rise throughout this period fig 4b it suggests that groundwater discharge from the deeper peat was diluting the surface despite the fact that the total na mass actually increased between these two periods this is consistent with the observed na and ec profiles fig 5 which shows lower concentrations at depth in the first year post construction 2013 average sodium concentrations in the near surface peat were generally low with an average of 87 mg l 1 kessel et al 2018 and did not exhibit any apparent relationship with depth below ground surface as expected with the material placement practices employed during construction nwaishi et al 2015 therefore spatial variability in salinity during this period reflected initial geochemical heterogeneity in the source material rather than any particular hydrological or geochemical process operating within the fen by 2019 the average na concentration in the upper 35 cm of the fen had increased nearly five fold to 292 mg l 1 however at greater depths average na concentrations in the fen at 50 90 and 150 cm bgs were 236 145 and 139 mg l 1 respectively thus not only had sodium concentrations increased above the initial background salinity of the fen both laterally across the surface and at depth but there was also a trend of increasing na concentrations towards the surface in the fen figs 4 and 5 hydrochemical modelling has shown a similar trend in the fen for 2018 which reflected an increase in surface salinity due to evapoconcentration sutton 2021 yet the observed salinity measured at depth is below the initial average concentration in the tailings sand which modelling indicates is partly a consequence of the initial arrival of relatively fresh water in the petroleum coke from the upland aquifer which has already begun to flush sutton 2021 the areas of highest na concentration and ec were observed near the southwest of the fen both at the surface and at depth whereas lower values were observed near the north and east of the fen fig 7 this could be partially explained by the water table which was above ground surface in the southwest corner for the entire duration of the study period fig 7 and thus evapotranspiration was likely highest there 4 4 mm day 1 scarlett et al 2017 leading to greater evapoconcentration yet the consistent presence of high salinity below the surface in this area which as previously noted was largely unaffected by the surface processes of dilution and evapoconcentration could reflect the dominance of other mechanisms these drivers of spatial variability could include geochemical heterogeneity and the presence of preferential flow paths in the peat however this salinity gradient from south to north could also simply be a consequence of the spatial patterns of groundwater flow from upland to fen across the transition zone and through the petroleum coke fig 1 specifically these nested groundwater flow paths will result in earlier arrival of na near the surface of the fen directly adjacent to the transition zone while the distal areas of the fen northern and western will have later arrival of upland groundwater and generally less effective surface flushing sutton 2021 while evapoconcentration and dilution have spatially heterogeneous impacts on surface concentration due to variability in microtopography vegetation cover and proximity to boundaries these differences appear to be somewhat ameliorated by processes of surface water redistribution this is indicated by the much more abrupt lateral changes in sodium concentration that occur at depth 10 and 30 cm bgs compared to the surface compare figs 7 and 8 5 2 sodium mass balance the initial total sodium mass in the entire system immediately post construction 2013 was estimated at 27 000 kg of which only 600 kg was in the fen peat simhayov et al 2017 by 2019 the sodium mass in the fen was estimated to have increased to 8 800 kg details of the calculation can be found in yang 2021 given an average annual duration of frost free conditions of 183 days sutton and price 2020b and assuming a constant daily rate of mass export equal to that identified in this present study 3 6 kg day 1 surface water discharge has removed over 4 600 kg of sodium or approximately 17 of the total mass within the system however this is likely an overestimation as in the first few years post construction the total mass of na in the near surface of the fen that could be mobilized and exported through surface water discharge was smaller than in 2019 nonetheless based on the change in na mass the average rate of mass transport from the upland into the fen since 2013 the first year of the constructed fen was approximately 10 kg d 1 by 2019 this na influx of sodium had transferred half of the total initial sodium mass in the upland aquifer into the fen peat however most of this na mass in the fen peat 68 was at depths greater than 35 cm nevertheless the na mass in the near surface of the fen has increased substantially in 2015 the estimated na mass in the saturated zone of the upper 70 cm of the fen was approximately 3 000 kg 0 15 kg m 3 of peat in the present study using a similar approach but for the top 35 cm of saturated peat na mass was estimated to be 2 400 kg 0 31 kg m 3 of peat in mid 2019 substantially greater than it was four years previously during the study period upward groundwater flow through the peat of 1 3 mm day 1 brought only 3 8 kg day 1 to the near surface of the fen this suggests that the sodium centre of mass has yet to arrive at the surface of the fen as such the peak sodium concentration in the near surface of the fen can be expected to rise further in the coming years surface water discharge cumulatively removed 261 kg of na over the 72 day mass balance period average of 3 6 kg day 1 in the early season mass export through surface water discharge was low in spite of high near surface na concentration as the growing season progressed near surface salinity was markedly reduced due to dilution by rainfall yet mass export increased towards the end of the season not included in the mass balance two relatively large rainfall events in close succession 38 and 15 mm produced a rapid increase of discharge 0 2 0 6 l s 1 although the na concentration measured in discharge was reduced the higher flow rate resulted in greater loss 116 kg of na mass over 17 days with an average of 6 8 kg day 1 compared to that in the early wet period average of 3 6 kg day 1 this can be attributed to the influence of water table conditions in controlling surface water discharge as the storage capacity of the fen must be exceeded before a meaningful rainfall runoff response could be elicited and therefore appreciable quantities of surface discharge generated thus solute export exhibited a threshold like response to meteorological conditions extrapolating the sodium export rate into the future until all sodium is flushed from the system suggests 36 frost free periods 6 672 days are required however a single season of data from a relatively cool and wet year is not sufficient to predict the flushing timeframe with precision furthermore as sodium mass accumulates in the near surface of the fen the concentration of the discharge water will likely increase and contingent on future climatological and hydrological conditions could result in greater mass export from the system generally the mass transport both into and out of the fen will exhibit an asymptotically diminishing rate in particular desorption from the peat will prolong the longevity of elevated salinity within the fen which may need to be considered when constructed fen systems are placed within the closure landscape the quality of surface water discharge that is passed to downgradient receptors will have a cascading impact on the ecology of these systems 5 3 implications for reclamation by 2019 the magnitude of salt accumulation had exceeded a threshold associated with increased production of labile and mobile dissolved organic carbon by vascular vegetation rooted in the peat prystupa 2020 furthermore the salinity stress threshold identified for a variety of common and relatively salt tolerant mosses bryum pseudotriquetrum and tomenthypnum nitens of 300 mg l 1 pouliot et al 2013 was exceeded across the majority of the fen surface particularly in the early dry period although mosses are desirable in reclamation projects due to their abundance in regional fens chee and vitt 1989 and carbon accumulation potential batzer and baldwin 2012 the current salinity conditions at the surface may limit moss establishment however mosses do not solely respond to average na concentration but also the duration of inundation in saline water pouliot et al 2013 while the sodium concentrations at just 10 cm bgs and deeper were essentially constant over the study period both spatially and temporally the salinity at the surface was highly variable and responded strongly to rainfall induced dilution and evapoconcentration since mosses are non vascular they are disproportionately influenced by the salinity of porewater directly at the surface and thus the temporary depression of surface concentration by rainfall may allow mosses to persist in otherwise hostile geochemical conditions this requires intentional monitoring of geochemistry directly at the surface since the subtleties of dilution were absent from na and ec measurements taken from shallow porewater samplers and piezometers the apparent correlation between water table depth and peak na concentration suggests that future constructed fens could use topographic variability to create diverse geochemical conditions across the surface which may offer a variety of ecological niches where mosses could survive approximating the hummock hollow topography that is characteristic of many boreal peatlands would provide a range of water table depths and allow for vegetation to self design areas where the water table is consistently deeper would experience greater salt flushing during precipitation events and less evapoconcentration during dry periods offering more suitable conditions for less salt tolerant mosses at nfw the microtopography of the peat surface was intentionally reduced however future systems could harness the variability that arises from the deposition and redistribution of peat which would have the added benefit of expediting site construction placing nfw in the context of natural and other reclaimed systems is a crucial step in understanding and anticipating the ecological trajectory of the watershed and ultimately to evaluating the success and feasibility of fen construction as a reclamation technique the design philosophy and materials used in the nfw differ from another constructed fen pilot project in the aosr sandhill fen watershed sfw the design of sfw placed a greater emphasis on bidirectional water sharing between upland and lowland features the central fen of sfw was surrounded by several raised landforms and perched fens which overlies a deposit of composite tailings and fine tailings sand biagi et al 2019 composite tailings have greater pore water concentrations of na in comparison to the coarse tailings sand used in the construction of the nfw aquifer and unlike the nikanotee fen the liner intended to limit groundwater exchange with underlying material did not extend into the upland biagi et al 2021 these design choices in combination with the absence of a natural outflow were identified as primary causes of salt accumulation at the surface of sfw biagi et al 2021 which exceeded 800 mg l 1 within 3 years post construction biagi et al 2019 similar to nfw the highest salinity at sfw was observed at the interface between upland and fen however the peak na concentration was 200 mg l 1 greater than what was measured in this study which was performed 7 years post construction although natural saline wetlands can be found in the region the na concentration at the surface of hypersaline fens can exceed 25 000 mg l 1 wells and price 2015 considering the large discrepancy in surface na concentration between the reclaimed and natural saline fens these natural fens may not be the most appropriate analogue to illustrate fen trajectory as has been proposed wells and price 2015 at least in the first decade post construction 5 4 error and uncertainty while the sample size for the original design of this study was reasonable more confidence in the results would have been possible with a larger sample size and repetitive sampling at randomly selected locations furthermore certain areas of the persistent ponds were inaccessible these areas may have had a stronger and more consistent evaporative signature therefore the surface water readily sampled in the field could bias the results towards a diluted signature additionally surface sampling events for na concentrations were not repeated at the exact same locations nor were the number of collected samples consistent between events water samples collected from discharge were also highly dependent on the water availability na concentration in surface discharge was estimated using logged ec validated with manually collected discharge samples if the water level was below the height of the v notch weir the ec measurement could reflect stagnant water meanwhile seepage water was collected less frequently thus the na mass estimated in discharge might be underestimated thereby contributing error to the na mass balance for the frost free period june 3 to august 13 the water balance showed a net gain of water from hydrological components 38 mm and yet the change in water storage showed an increase of 41 mm with only 3 mm error 8 table 1 which was likely due to measurement error however the na mass balance estimated using the hydrological fluxes of the water balance m fen was 14 kg which was larger than change in na mass storage estimated with concentrations m upper of 66 kg this residual was 80 kg which may be attributed to measurement error in the estimation of na mass export in surface water discharge or the different spatial extents that the mass balance methods were applied specifically the na mass balance based on changes to concentration only considered the near surface of the peat and thus does not consider a possible net gain to sodium in the deeper layers of the fen over the study period the first sampling event of this study was conducted a month after the spring freshet which can be the most important hydrological moment of the year given the considerable depth of snowmelt and the limited infiltration capacity resulting from a high antecedent water table therefore frost table and occluded pores the freshet would cause the highest annual surface water discharge event however the interaction between snowmelt and near surface solutes is unclear particularly because of the presence of seasonal ground ice during the study period it was demonstrated that although rainfall diluted surface salinity and reduced the concentration of surface water discharge the mass export increased during these periods whether this observation is applicable to the spring freshet would largely be contingent on the accessibility of near surface na and whether it can be readily mobilized by surface water movement further studies should specifically look at the spring freshet to determine if this relationship between discharge and mass export is also consistent during the snowmelt period 6 conclusion this study assessed the spatiotemporal patterns transport and export of near surface na within a reclaimed fen 7 years post construction in general na concentration and ec measured in ponded surface water steadily increased due to high evapotranspiration but was sensitive to freshwater inputs rainfall which caused variability in concentration and redistribution between surface ponds na concentration decreased as precipitation introduced fresh water resulting in dilution 61 reduction in na concentration in response to june 28 rainfall and increased as evapotranspiration removed water but not solutes from the system resulting in evapoconcentration however these processes had little influence on na concentration and ec measured at even modest depths 10 cm bgs which not only remained unaffected by dilution but slightly increased over the study period this demonstrates the subtlety of dilution which requires intentional monitoring and consideration in hydrochemical studies or modelling shallow pore water samples did not reflect the dynamic geochemical conditions directly at the surface i e in ponded water while na concentration in ponded water may affect the development of vascular species less than conditions deeper in the rooting zone it has implications for the growth productivity and survival of mosses which typically exhibit low salinity tolerance boerner and forman 1975 given the non vascular nature of bryophytes salinity of water closest to the surface will have the dominant influence on their productivity since mosses are regionally abundant peat forming species in many fens batzer and baldwin 2012 and are targeted for inclusion in reclaimed peatlands the chemistry of surface water should be studied in detail the highest salinity was found near the southwest corner which had the highest average water table and was adjacent to the transition zone in contrast the lowest na concentration and ec were found near the northeast corner where it was relatively dry throughout the study period close to the discharge point of the fen and far from the primary source of salinity upland aquifer a trend of higher na concentration from the centre of the fen towards the discharge point was observed in the surface as a result of lower elevation ponds and surface flow towards the outflow this illustrates the importance of both topography and proximity to process affected materials in influencing near surface geochemistry both of these aspects of system design could be manipulated in future constructed fens to improve the management of salinity and offer a greater variety of geochemical conditions for vegetation to occupy ultimately na from upland tailings sand will migrate to the fen peat and leave the system though discharge the estimated na mass leaving the system was 4 kg day 1 through discharge over the frost free period amounting to 261 kg of export between june and august assuming similar meteorological conditions to those in 2019 the approximate time for complete na export from the nikanotee fen is about 36 years post construction however the actual timeline will vary depending on the prevailing meteorological conditions whereby wetter conditions will result in more rapid export of na continued monitoring of na in surface water discharge beginning prior to the spring freshet is recommended to further illuminate the impact of snowmelt and differing meteorological conditions on surface concentration and sodium mass export furthermore with the outflow being the sole pathway for solute removal from the system monitoring the concentration and rate of sodium removal is relatively easy and summarizes a host of complex hydrochemical processes credit authorship contribution
