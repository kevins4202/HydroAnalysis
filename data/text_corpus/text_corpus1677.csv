8385,study region considering the availability of gauged data the karasnagala watershed of attanagalu oya located in the gampaha district in the western province of sri lanka was modeled with epa swmm 5 study focus this study analyses the effect of the catchment field approximations for accurate flood hydrograph prediction following an event based approach 3 days minimum inter event time mit and 0 mm day minimum inter event depth med were used as the threshold fifty events were separated from 1971 to 1982 period four major field approximation types were identified stream geometrical parameters approximations soil infiltration parameter approximations approximation of watershed intermittent storages and subcatchment delineation approximation soil parameter approximations and the stream network geometry parameter approximations were verified by the field observations new hydrological insights for the region model calibration and verification revealed that epa swmm5 can be successfully used to develop regional karasnagala watershed model with mean ratio of absolute error mrae 0 289 for calibration and 0 375 mrae for verification incorporation of intermittent storages with optimized model layout obtained the best fitting of hydrograph recession mrae 0 167 subcatchment lumping with a 16 sub basin configuration showed the marginal increment of modeling error when compared with distributed modeling stream parameter approximations revealed that the head water streams lesser order streams parameters sensitivity is higher than that of the higher order streams in soil parameter approximations saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil was the most influencing parameter keywords swmm mit field approximations rainfall event recession curve 1 introduction majority of hydrological studies aim to calculate the design flow of relevant hydraulic infrastructures layan et al 2013 zeng et al 2016 according to lockie 2009 in most of cases detailed hydrological and hydraulic modeling were implemented for stormwater and wastewater management to assess network performance and develop remediation options these hydrological and hydraulic modeling studies have used a number of software products vaze et al 2012 state that the model selection should follow the scope of the study data availability required accuracy and user objectives according to zoppou 2001 the model user believes that impressive results from the model can be obtained if the user sets up a highly detailed model however what is actually required is an expert system which assists the user in selecting a model that balances the modeling effort with the scope of the study zoppou 2001 most hydrological simulations are capable of identifying the time to peak and the peak flow but less good in the recession mandeville 2016 emphasises the key role played by the slow flow component of storm runoff which is obviously the recession that has not been given appropriate attention in the existing event based studies in literature however the flood peak and the flood residence time depending on the recession behaviour are important for flood plain management according to mcintyre et al 2012 the impact of land use change on the shape of a hydrograph depends strongly on the properties of the channel network and hence an accurate representation of channel routing processes is critical to the assessment for the convenience of modeling most models approximate complex sub stream networks into simple networks the shape roughness and side slopes of the modeled stream segments and the model layout are changed to represent the routing effect from the intermittent storages rouhani et al 2009 most hydrological models are characterized by a set of parameters which are uncertain and not directly measurable thus obtaining an optimal model becomes a complex task zhan et al 2013 when satisfying the conditions such as time efficiency and the cost efficiency in most of engineering applications approximated values are used for both field measured and derived parameters generally models solving the shallow water wave equations are used to design storm water infrastructure zoppou 2001 the cross sectional information roughness coefficients boundary conditions and the details of internal structures are the information required to solve shallow water wave equations for some catchments these information are not available generally field parameter approximations are required in application of shallow water wave equations for the models zoppou 2001 the effects of these approximations on the model output are rarely discussed in literature therefore the objectives of this study strive to analyse the applicability of an urban stormwater model epa swmm 5 for a regional watershed to analyse the effect of catchment field approximations for accurate flood hydrograph prediction and to identify the deficiencies and possible solutions for the regional watershed modeling 2 storm water management model epa swmm 5 swmm is a fully dynamic deterministic distributed conceptual watershed simulation model for single event or long term simulation of runoff quantity and quality primarily from urban areas gülbaz and kazezyılmaz alhan 2017 it has the capability to include urban stormwater controlling elements such as pumps orifices manholes weirs flow dividers and conduits version 5 running with microsoft windows provides an integrated environment for editing data running hydrologic hydraulic and water quality simulations and viewing of the model results gülbaz et al 2019 rossman 2009 it conceptualizes a drainage system as a series of water and material flows between four major environmental compartments 1 atmosphere compartment from which precipitation falls and generates surface and subsurface hydrographs based upon antecedent subsurface moisture conditions soil characteristics detention storages land use characteristics drainage area and topography is known as physiographic characteristics 2 land surface compartment where the pollutants are deposited is represented by subcatchment objects 3 groundwater compartment which receives infiltration from the land surface compartment is based on either green ampt or horton infiltration models and transfers a portion of this inflow to the transport compartment 4 transport compartment contains a network of conveyance storage regulation and treatment elements all compartments do not need to appear in a particular swmm model rossman 2009 swmm runs according to any given time frame there are no intrinsic limitations regulating the duration of a continuous simulation in the model except the time required by the computer to perform a large number of calculations compromising the time steps during wet and dry periods assists minimizing computing time without significant loss of information in the model output when rainfall input is introduced to the model it begins a time step by the time step accounting of water movement and losses by doing various processes as runoff infiltration evaporation and surface storage in this situation each subcatchment surface is treated as nonlinear reservoir the capacity of the reservoir denotes the maximum depression storage consisting surface ponding surface wetting and interception surface runoff occurs when the depth of water in the reservoir exceeds the maximum depression storage rossman 2009 smith 2004 3 study area catchment of attanagalu oya at karasnagala fig 1 located at the gampaha district in the western province of sri lanka was selected as the study area the highest rainfall was recorded during the southwest monsoon between may and november with the mean annual rainfall of 2900 mm on average the driest month january receives a monthly rainfall of 24 mm while the rainfall in the wettest month november is 443 mm ponrajah 1984 dharmasena 1986 das 1987 from 2006 2010 the rainfall data analysis for the same catchment reveals that wettest month has been moved to october and the driest month has been changed to february most of the roads are located close to the valleys the study area is located in a hilly terrain the major tributaries of the attanagalu oya were observed by performing three field visits the watershed area is about 52 6 km2 and the longest stream length is about 9 7 km fig 1 the average slope along the longest stream is approximately 1 4 and time of concentration is nearly 100 min more than 90 of the area is undeveloped and the major cultivation is rubber fig 1 top soil condition was dark brown sandy lean clay with occasional gravel and river bank and bed conditions were light brown silty clay with frequent small roots watershed at karasnagala is gauged by the irrigation department of sri lanka according to the irrigation department measurements bed elevation of the attanagalu oya at karasnagla gauging station is 27 mmsl the study period from 1971 to 1982 was selected due to the presence of identified data errors after 1982 wijesekera and wanniarachchi 2016 daily data from two rain gauges at karasnagala and vincit stations and streamflow gauging data at karasnagala 7 6 44 66 n 80 10 22 36 e were available 4 materials methods 4 1 data in sri lanka water data of attanagalu oya basin are scattered among many institutions the meteorology department and irrigation department provided the rainfall evaporation and streamflow data of the basin a detailed soil map was obtained from the survey department most of rainfall and streamflow values were measured and recorded either on daily or in monthly averages hourly or three hourly resolution data are available only at the recently established gauging stations 1 10 000 topographic maps were the source of updated land information high resolution satellite images were used only to visually inspect the dynamic behaviour of land use in the catchment 4 2 field data in order to simulate the actual field conditions physical parameters of the major streams were measured in 100 m interval and subcatchment land use land cover details were recorded to the greatest possible extent due to the seasonal variation of the water level of the natural streams capturing of the average stream width as a model input parameter was needed therefore a stakeholder data collection was implemented to fulfill the needs stream type variation was another important factor observed during the fieldwork most of the streams observed on the topographic maps were ephemeral streams hand held gps units were used to locate the places where stream shape variation were observed fig 2 4 3 event separation the event based modeling approach is closer to science and it has the capability of reasonable reflection of watershed behaviour tayfur and singh 2006 kjeldsen et al 2013 efstratiadis et al 2014 hossain et al 2019 in the absence of continuous data the mike nam model with the case study of ben hai river basin has been calibrated and validated by giang and phuong 2010 using individual storm events and it was identified that the continuous simulation is impossible especially in the steep small basins with short time of concentration therefore an event based approach was followed in this study event identification for most of the storms can be done only with streamflow data through an analysis of the baseflow recession curves aksoy et al 2001 however for complex storms in which the identified inflection point on the receding limb is a local minimum due to another rainfall event prior to the end of the concerned event then the identification of the end time becomes complicated huff and begovich 1976 snyder and curlin 1969 linsley et al 1975 have described a method to demarcate the end point of the direct runoff hydrograph using the number n of days from the hydrograph peak or the last runoff generating rainfall however it has also been stated that the value of n is not particularly critical when compared to the basin slope and other runoff generation factors such as the land cover and the soil type kohler and linsley 1951 linsley et al 1975 assuming that the groundwater baseflow storage is linear blume et al 2007 proposed an objective but non physically based method to identify the end point of event runoff the method used by mahe 2009 to determine the time of surface runoff disappearance has been proposed with the use of the depletion curves and the fluctuation of groundwater level observations even though a threshold rainfall amount and a minimum inter event time mit value are required to separate rainfall events suitable values could not be identified from the literature considering the time tested unit hydrograph uh method ritzema 1994 the watershed response time of direct runoff for one day unit rainfall was used in order to determine the mit for one day rainfall input considering the data resolution one day synthetic unit hydrograph for karasnagala watershed was developed fig 3 results showed that the time base was 4 days hence the mit for this watershed was taken as 3 days and 0 mm day minimum inter event depth med was taken as the threshold rainfall value of the analysis 4 4 model development gülbaz and kazezyılmaz alhan 2018 investigating the effect of low impact development lid on water quality concludes the capability of epa swmm 5 as a hydrological model applying the epa swmm model for scott creek subcatchment of the onkaparinga river subhashini et al 2013 shows the complexity and the issues encountered in modeling hydrologic response of a rural catchment and how these issues were managed to develop reliable model predictions according to subhashini et al 2013 swmm is increasingly used in rural catchment for understanding future urbanization scenarios impacts and investigating the effectiveness of water sensitive urban design wsud or the best management practice bmp measures therefore in the present study the effect of the field approximations was analysed by applying the swmm model for an area which is not highly urbanized therefore in this model layout development work factors of the existing stormwater controlling tools of epa swmm 5 0 were suitably accommodated to represent a rural catchment behaviour table 1 stage by stage model layout development parameter optimization model calibration and verification are implemented as salient features of the methodology 4 5 subcatchment delineation subwatershed delineation was the next challenge because the spatial aggregation of watershed parameters depends on the number of subdivisions the number of subdivisions subcatchments in the watershed model is an important field approximation of watershed modeling it directly contributes to the output of the model when determining the number of subdivisions of the model the computation time efficiency and the required accuracy of the model were compromised while following scientific methodology for subcatchment delineation the basis of subcatchment delineation was the stream order when the 1st order or 2nd order stream segment were to define the subcatchment outlet a large number of subcatchments nearly 400 should be taken as the system in case of 3rd order streams only sixteen subcatchments were identified when considering 4th order streams only four subcatchments would be sufficient to define the system also approximating fully lumped layout single catchment model can be identified the fully distributed layout for this watershed at 3rd order streams contained 16 subcatchments with 72 spatially distributed intermittent storage subcatchments while without approximations for storage area fig 4 layout a when determining the semi lumped layout it was difficult to conceptualize the best number of subdivisions for the watershed considering whether a layout will be classified as distributed or as lumped or as semi lumped however when following the stream ordering method as the basis for subcatchment delineation there were no combinations in between 16 subcatchment layout and 4 subcatchment layout options the layout with 16 major subcatchments with 16 intermittent storage subcatchments fig 4 layout b and layout with 4 major subcatchments with 4 intermittent storage subcatchments fig 4 layout c were considered as semi lumped layouts for this research the selected lumped layout was with one major catchment and one storage subcatchment which contains spatial aggregation of storage area approximations fig 4 layout d when observing the natural stream network of the karasnagala watershed and the contour pattern subcatchment for each single stream segment can be used with a minimum spatial aggregation however breaking into more subcatchments without calibrating each and every subcatchment is meaningless if the discharge measurements were available at each subcatchment level the fully distributed layout will be the best option if not it just increases the number of variables without intermittent check however when coming to modeling it was a tedious task to adjust each subcatchment parameters and stream network parameters at each model run time which in turn increased the model complexity when the modelling approach moves from the distributed to lumped the effect of the spatial aggregation of watershed parameters was a critical consideration 4 6 field approximations field approximation of subdivision level used stream bifurcations of the study area stream network for the model was established based on 1 10 000 topographic maps and satellite images also field verification of stream network was used to apply stream ordering method in this study the scientific method strahler 1964 was used to develop the stream network modeling with field approximations such as channel network arrangement lateral connections and intermittent storages should follow proper guidelines to represent the behaviour of the outflow hydrograph the absence of guidelines made it a challenging task the representation of the watershed characteristics in the model layout was the next challenge of this study trial and error cases were applied to identify the representative model layout quantitative representation and qualitative representation of the connectivity of the catchment intermittent storages were identified as the objectives of the layout parameter optimization then the conceptual model layout was developed to represent the spatially distributed intermittent storages and their connections to the major stream network the infiltration parameters of the catchment and physical parameters of the stream network were determined using field measurements for the model soil parameter approximations and the stream network geometry parameter approximations were verified through the field observations and with the literature support chow 1959 chow et al 2010 hunukumbura 2007 ritzema 1994 rossman 2009 there were no difficulties in approximations those parameter values can be identified as unique parameters corresponding to a particular watershed efforts and the experiences of above studies can provide the guidance but a modeler needs to control the layout parameters such as optimum number of subdivisions spatially distributed storages quantity and their connectivity to the stream network for optimum results therefore the most important component of this study was to identify representative swmm layout for the karasnagala watershed after the calibration and verification of epa swmm model for the karasnagala watershed effect of the selected field approximations were analysed 4 7 storage modelling significant volume difference and mismatching of recession curves in observed and modeled hydrographs were the major observations with optimum subdivision level and optimized model experimental parameters the reasons for the aforementioned behavior could be due to the model s quick response for the rainfall and misrepresentation of the catchment storages behavior a quick response is expected as epa swmm 5 was specially designed for urban stormwater modeling it was sufficiently modified with conceptual storage parameters to change the peak and the recession which describes the withdrawal of catchment water storage then the paddy area natural marshy lands and the connectivity of those areas to the stream network were modeled options for the intermittent storages modeling were tested with the node ponding option and detention storage option of epa swmm 5 0 the detention storage option can incorporate infiltration parameters and evaporation factors to the storage unit rossman 2009 however insignificant evaporation in a flooding situation with cloudy environments and the insignificant infiltration amount in the wet soil condition reduce the effectiveness of the detention storage option in the detention storage option subcatchment runoff pools up in the storage area and then releases through the defined outlet if the water depth exceeds the maximum depth of the storage unit water will pool up on top of it and release when capacity permits fig 5 however in real situations the water comes to the node first and if the maximum depth of the node exceeds the node will flood and pool on top of the node that flooded area may be the paddy land or marshy land close to the node when the capacity permits water is released from the flooded area to the node in the detention storage option this phenomena occurs in the reverse direction the node ponding option is conceptually closer to reality than the detention storage option therefore the node ponding option was used for the further modeling work catchment intermittent storages clustering and incorporating to the model layout were done according to the synthetic unit hydrograph theory accordingly the stream length along the longest stream lcpd the stream length from the centroid of the storage area to the intersection point perpendicular to the longest stream lp and the stream length from the centroid of the catchment to the intersection point perpendicular to the longest stream lc were defined fig 6 the influence of intermittent catchment storages on model output was assessed with four model schematic diagrams fig 7 further investigation of the intermittent storages behavior has been identified that the outlet control tool should be introduced to control the storage on the node the swmm weir tool was used as the outlet control tool four model schematic diagrams were defined as schematic diagram a with no storage options schematic diagram b with node storage direct connection schematic diagram c with optimized lcpd and lp and schematic diagram d with optimized lcpd and lp and weir 4 8 model calibration model calibration and verification were done using the observed runoff data in the model calibration the calibration parameters were divided into two categories controllable parameters and less controllable parameters the watershed parameters such as depression storage suction head saturated hydraulic conductivity initial deficit and channel roughness are less controllable parameters boundary values and the limitations pertaining to those parameters are defined by the literature hunukumbura 2007 rossman 2009 chow 1959 chow et al 2010 the model layout parameters such as intermittent storages and their connectivity to main stream network are controllable parameters the model layout optimization process shows the conversion of the mathematical watershed model which was developed for urban stormwater modeling into the regional watershed modeling when observing the results it is clear that adequate representation of the behaviour of the catchment intermittent storages in a model provided significant improvement of the hydrograph recession limb matching a summary of the parameter values obtained for calibration events are shown in table 4 numerical values were assigned for the lcpd and lp considering the average of the sixteen subcatchments values tables 2 and 3 show the average values used for the stream length optimization assessing the goodness of fit of a model is done with the use of objective functions the behaviour of the measure of the effectiveness of model output is described mathematically using objective functions it is important to identify the actual relationship between objective function variables and the measure of efficacy arsham 1994 setting up a meaningful objective function is usually a tedious task which follows a trial and error process the optimum parameters set minimizes the objective function that is discovered at the calibration process the failure of an objective function could occur due to the selections of a wrong set of variables 1 m r a e 1 n i 1 n q o b s i q s i m i q o b s i mrae provides the information about the predicting capability as well as the distribution of the prediction errors of the model the best fit between the observed and calculated values would be mrae 0 majority of events the error of observed and the simulated streamflow was always higher in the high streamflow region than that of the lower flow region baseflow rmse and mrae provide important information about the predictive capabilities of the model he et al 2014 the rmse measures the goodness of fit relevant to high rainfall values while the mrae provides more balanced perspective of the goodness of fit at a moderate value distribution of the estimation errors feng et al 2014 one observation while applying the nash sutcliffe ns efficiency is highlighting the mismatching of the peak flow region and relatively lower interpretation of the mismatching in lower flow values therefore mrae was selected as an objective function to evaluate the goodness of fit of the model 5 results 5 1 optimum number of subcatchments delineation comparison of the model generated outflow hydrograph of the fully distributed 16 subcatchment semi lumped 4 subcatchment semi lumped and fully lumped subcatchment model layouts for sample rainfall runoff event shows in fig 8 according to fig 8 major peak matching and poor matching of initial peaks have been achieved by the fully distributed layout a perfect initial peaks matching and poor matching of major peak have been achieved by four subcatchment semi lumped layout the optimization of modeling effort and modeling error has enabled the identification of optimum model layout for the karasnagala watershed fig 9 tables 5 and 6 show the recession curve mrae for schematic diagram a with no intermittent storages and schematic diagram d with optimized storage parameters figs 10 and 11 illustrate the improvement of the results model calibration shows the mean ratio of absolute error mrae 0 289 and 0 375 mrae for verification incorporation of intermittent storages with optimized model layout improved the outflow hydrograph recession curve matching mrae from 0 268 to 0 167 with no time lag 5 2 stream parameter approximation the effect for 15 sample events of the stream bed and bank roughness value when it varies 50 from the field estimated roughness value is shown in table 7 when consider the average difference it is less than 2 variation from the modeled streamflow peak for the optimized parameters also it is observed that the effect of the stream bed and bank roughness on the hydrograph peak is decreasing with the increment of the stream order 6 discussion the upstream and downstream storage area definition was based on the floodplain definition that depends on the catchment slope ded 2013 defines floodplain area as slope less than 4 when the catchment slope along the main stream of each subcatchment was analyzed storage areas contained within the floodplain are considered as downstream storage area and the rest is considered as upstream storage area in the iteration process the model calculates the next time step outputs based on the current time step results the continuous modeling will cause the accumulation of error and would be difficult to calibrate the model with finer resolution data therefore most of time continuous modeling use the coarser resolution data however in event based analysis each and every event has more degree of freedom to vary the flow governing parameters such as antecedent wetness and event model parameters also in continuous rainfall runoff modeling usually a spin up warm up period is used before the actual calibration to establish the model parameter to adjust to the current hydrological conditions with the spin up period the effects from initial values in continuous rainfall runoff modeling can be avoided however the determination of the spin up period is not clearly defined kaffas and hrissanthou 2014 comparing continuous and event based rainfall runoff modeling hossain et al 2019 concludes that event based modelling outperforms the continuous simulation approach therefore an event based approach was utilized in this study however event based modeling required reliable event separation criteria suitable for the study area there were no guidelines to determine the mit for the attanagalu oya catchment at the karasnagala the new approach proposed by this study is the approximation of the time base for one day duration unit hydrograph as the direct runoff duration of one day duration rainfall epa swmm 5 0 model recommends the hourly resolution rainfall data for the analysis therefore it avoids the loss of finer details of the outflow hydrograph of the model in the absence of finer resolution data this study used the daily resolution data however the majority of the events show the model generated outflow hydrograph pattern fluctuations is similar to the observed streamflow hydrograph that is due to the usage of optimum calculation time step considering the continuity equation and observing the model output details trial and error calculation time step adjustments can be used to identify the optimum calculation time step in the subcatchment delineation process field verified topographic map can be used as the base data after generating the stream network stream ordering can be used to define the subcatchments while keeping the required accuracy and the effort as the boundary conditions relative to the fully distributed model layout percentage increment of mrae in semi lumped 16 sub catchment model layout semi lumped 4 sub catchment model layout and single catchment fully lumped model layout are 21 74 73 69 and 165 94 respectively these values interpret the model performance in different field approximation levels of complex stream network and spatially distributed catchment parameters having karasnagala stream gauge as the only possibility to calibrate the model there is no point of moving into finer resolution distributed subcatchement delineation without intermittent verification at each subcatchment level singh and kumar 2017 terink et al 2018 therefore when selecting the study area it is recommend to check the possibility of intermittent verification at least for one small subcatchment within major catchment boundary wallner et al 2012 7 modeling errors and limitations during the field work a number of assumptions for the field parameter measurements and simpliﬁcations for the complex stream network were implemented to reduce the effort and time which can contribute to more errors in the model development the environmental protection agency which has developed this model recommended the application of swmm for the urban stormwater modeling also past modeling experiences of the researchers were focused on the application of swmm for urban stormwater modeling with sub daily resolution data however in this study with coarser resolution input rainfall data there was a possibility of losing important information of the model output hydrograph the precipitation data used were obtained from two rain gauge stations and thiessen averaged rainfall was applied uniformly over the catchment area theissen averaging identifies the theissen area factors for the karasnagala rain gauge and the vincit rain gauge as 0 21 and 0 79 respectively it clearly indicates the average rainfall is biased towards vincit gauging station due to the spatial variation of the rain gauges and the ambiguities in model calibration and verification reveals that the theissen averaging may not be the best method to identify the representative rainfall for the karasnagala stream gauge this may add errors to the model output the green ampt infiltration parameters were calculated by the area weighted average soil parameters and assumed to be uniform over the entire catchment also the vertical distribution of soil profile was assumed to be uniform in the unsaturated zone these assumptions can have a signiﬁcant impact on soil moisture characteristics 8 conclusions the outflow hydrograph recession limb and the hydrograph peak behaviour depend on the catchment storage representation method while initial peaks and the rising limb of the outflow hydrograph depend on the antecedent wetness which is controlled by the model infiltration parameters the key points identified from the field approximation of subcatchment delineation are that there is no combination between the 16 sub catchment model layout and semi lumped 4 sub catchment model layout and the effort of the 16 sub catchment model layout is marginally increased from the semi lumped 4 sub catchment model layout the effect of the stream bed and bank roughness on the hydrograph peak decreases with the increment of the stream order the main reason for this observation can be identified as the stream density usually the density of the lesser order streams is greater than that of the higher order streams the conclusions of this research are as follows 1 a qualitative evaluation of available models and the model development calibration verification revealed that epa swmm 5 can be used to develop a rural watershed model 2 the semi distributed 16 sub basin configuration is more appropriate and practical model configuration for the karasnagala catchment as this configuration only increases the error marginally compared to the fully distributed model configuration 3 the hydrograph recession limb matching is highly correlated with the watershed intermittent storage modeling approximations and calibration of the model conceptual parameters provided the best fitting of hydrograph recession limb with mrae 0 167 4 the effect of the stream bed and bank roughness on the hydrograph peak decreases with the increment of the stream order therefore bed and bank roughness approximation of head water streams or the lesser order streams should be done precisely when compared with higher order streams 5 the determination of the mit by the unit hydrograph method is a reliable and rational solution for any region with similar conditions of the karasnagala watershed in an event based modeling identification of the end time of an event is a subjective method it is recommend that further investigations on the defining mit by unit hydrograph method should be conducted to identify end time of an event declaration of competing interest i

majority of hydrological studies aim to calculate the design flow of relevant hydraulic infrastructures layan et al 2013 zeng et al 2016 according to lockie 2009 in most of cases detailed hydrological and hydraulic modeling were implemented for stormwater and wastewater management to assess network performance and develop remediation options these hydrological and hydraulic modeling studies have used a number of software products vaze et al 2012 state that the model selection should follow the scope of the study data availability required accuracy and user objectives according to zoppou 2001 the model user believes that impressive results from the model can be obtained if the user sets up a highly detailed model however what is actually required is an expert system which assists the user in selecting a model that balances the modeling effort with the scope of the study zoppou 2001 most hydrological simulations are capable of identifying the time to peak and the peak flow but less good in the recession mandeville 2016 emphasises the key role played by the slow flow component of storm runoff which is obviously the recession that has not been given appropriate attention in the existing event based studies in literature however the flood peak and the flood residence time depending on the recession behaviour are important for flood plain management according to mcintyre et al 2012 the impact of land use change on the shape of a hydrograph depends strongly on the properties of the channel network and hence an accurate representation of channel routing processes is critical to the assessment for the convenience of modeling most models approximate complex sub stream networks into simple networks the shape roughness and side slopes of the modeled stream segments and the model layout are changed to represent the routing effect from the intermittent storages rouhani et al 2009 most hydrological models are characterized by a set of parameters which are uncertain and not directly measurable thus obtaining an optimal model becomes a complex task zhan et al 2013 when satisfying the conditions such as time efficiency and the cost efficiency in most of engineering applications approximated values are used for both field measured and derived parameters generally models solving the shallow water wave equations are used to design storm water infrastructure zoppou 2001 the cross sectional information roughness coefficients boundary conditions and the details of internal structures are the information required to solve shallow water wave equations for some catchments these information are not available generally field parameter approximations are required in application of shallow water wave equations for the models zoppou 2001 the effects of these approximations on the model output are rarely discussed in literature therefore the objectives of this study strive to analyse the applicability of an urban stormwater model epa swmm 5 for a regional watershed to analyse the effect of catchment field approximations for accurate flood hydrograph prediction and to identify the deficiencies and possible solutions for the regional watershed modeling 2

conveyance storage regulation and treatment elements all compartments do not need to appear in a particular swmm model rossman 2009 swmm runs according to any given time frame there are no intrinsic limitations regulating the duration of a continuous simulation in the model except the time required by the computer to perform a large number of calculations compromising the time steps during wet and dry periods assists minimizing computing time without significant loss of information in the model output when rainfall input is introduced to the model it begins a time step by the time step accounting of water movement and losses by doing various processes as runoff infiltration evaporation and surface storage in this situation each subcatchment surface is treated as nonlinear reservoir the capacity of the reservoir denotes the maximum depression storage consisting surface ponding surface wetting and interception surface runoff occurs when the depth of water in the reservoir exceeds the maximum depression storage rossman 2009 smith 2004 3 study area catchment of attanagalu oya at karasnagala fig 1 located at the gampaha district in the western province of sri lanka was selected as the study area the highest rainfall was recorded during the southwest monsoon between may and november with the mean annual rainfall of 2900 mm on average the driest month january receives a monthly rainfall of 24 mm while the rainfall in the wettest month november is 443 mm ponrajah 1984 dharmasena 1986 das 1987 from 2006 2010 the rainfall data analysis for the same catchment reveals that wettest month has been moved to october and the driest month has been changed to february most of the roads are located close to the valleys the study area is located in a hilly terrain the major tributaries of the attanagalu oya were observed by performing three field visits the watershed area is about 52 6 km2 and the longest stream length is about 9 7 km fig 1 the average slope along the longest stream is approximately 1 4 and time of concentration is nearly 100 min more than 90 of the area is undeveloped and the major cultivation is rubber fig 1 top soil condition was dark brown sandy lean clay with occasional gravel and river bank and bed conditions were light brown silty clay with frequent small roots watershed at karasnagala is gauged by the irrigation department of sri lanka according to the irrigation department measurements bed elevation of the attanagalu oya at karasnagla gauging station is 27 mmsl the study period from 1971 to 1982 was selected due to the presence of identified data errors after 1982 wijesekera and wanniarachchi 2016 daily data from two rain gauges at karasnagala and vincit stations and streamflow gauging data at karasnagala 7 6 44 66 n 80 10 22 36 e were available 4 materials methods 4 1 data in sri lanka water data of attanagalu oya basin are scattered among many institutions the meteorology department and irrigation department provided the rainfall evaporation and streamflow data of the basin a detailed soil map was obtained from the survey department most of rainfall and streamflow values were measured and recorded either on daily or in monthly averages hourly or three hourly resolution data are available only at the recently established gauging stations 1 10 000 topographic maps were the source of updated land information high resolution satellite images were used only to visually inspect the dynamic behaviour of land use in the catchment 4 2 field data in order to simulate the actual field conditions physical parameters of the major streams were measured in 100 m interval and subcatchment land use land cover details were recorded to the greatest possible extent due to the seasonal variation of the water level of the natural streams capturing of the average stream width as a model input parameter was needed therefore a stakeholder data collection was implemented to fulfill the needs stream type variation was another important factor observed during the fieldwork most of the streams observed on the topographic maps were ephemeral streams hand held gps units were used to locate the places where stream shape variation were observed fig 2 4 3 event separation the event based modeling approach is closer to science and it has the capability of reasonable reflection of watershed behaviour tayfur and singh 2006 kjeldsen et al 2013 efstratiadis et al 2014 hossain et al 2019 in the absence of continuous data the mike nam model with the case study of ben hai river basin has been calibrated and validated by giang and phuong 2010 using individual storm events and it was identified that the continuous simulation is impossible especially in the steep small basins with short time of concentration therefore an event based approach was followed in this study event identification for most of the storms can be done only with streamflow data through an analysis of the baseflow recession curves aksoy et al 2001 however for complex storms in which the identified inflection point on the receding limb is a local minimum due to another rainfall event prior to the end of the concerned event then the identification of the end time becomes complicated huff and begovich 1976 snyder and curlin 1969 linsley et al 1975 have described a method to demarcate the end point of the direct runoff hydrograph using the number n of days from the hydrograph peak or the last runoff generating rainfall however it has also been stated that the value of n is not particularly critical when compared to the basin slope and other runoff generation factors such as the land cover and the soil type kohler and linsley 1951 linsley et al 1975 assuming that the groundwater baseflow storage is linear blume et al 2007 proposed an objective but non physically based method to identify the end point of event runoff the method used by mahe 2009 to determine the time of surface runoff disappearance has been proposed with the use of the depletion curves and the fluctuation of groundwater level observations even though a threshold rainfall amount and a minimum inter event time mit value are required to separate rainfall events suitable values could not be identified from the literature considering the time tested unit hydrograph uh method ritzema 1994 the watershed response time of direct runoff for one day unit rainfall was used in order to determine the mit for one day rainfall input considering the data resolution one day synthetic unit hydrograph for karasnagala watershed was developed fig 3 results showed that the time base was 4 days hence the mit for this watershed was taken as 3 days and 0 mm day minimum inter event depth med was taken as the threshold rainfall value of the analysis 4 4 model development gülbaz and kazezyılmaz alhan 2018 investigating the effect of low impact development lid on water quality concludes the capability of epa swmm 5 as a hydrological model applying the epa swmm model for scott creek subcatchment of the onkaparinga river subhashini et al 2013 shows the complexity and the issues encountered in modeling hydrologic response of a rural catchment and how these issues were managed to develop reliable model predictions according to subhashini et al 2013 swmm is increasingly used in rural catchment for understanding future urbanization scenarios impacts and investigating the effectiveness of water sensitive urban design wsud or the best management practice bmp measures therefore in the present study the effect of the field approximations was analysed by applying the swmm model for an area which is not highly urbanized therefore in this model layout development work factors of the existing stormwater controlling tools of epa swmm 5 0 were suitably accommodated to represent a rural catchment behaviour table 1 stage by stage model layout development parameter optimization model calibration and verification are implemented as salient features of the methodology 4 5 subcatchment delineation subwatershed delineation was the next challenge because the spatial aggregation of watershed parameters depends on the number of subdivisions the number of subdivisions subcatchments in the watershed model is an important field approximation of watershed modeling it directly contributes to the output of the model when determining the number of subdivisions of the model the computation time efficiency and the required accuracy of the model were compromised while following scientific methodology for subcatchment delineation the basis of subcatchment delineation was the stream order when the 1st order or 2nd order stream segment were to define the subcatchment outlet a large number of subcatchments nearly 400 should be taken as the system in case of 3rd order streams only sixteen subcatchments were identified when considering 4th order streams only four subcatchments would be sufficient to define the system also approximating fully lumped layout single catchment model can be identified the fully distributed layout for this watershed at 3rd order streams contained 16 subcatchments with 72 spatially distributed intermittent storage subcatchments while without approximations for storage area fig 4 layout a when determining the semi lumped layout it was difficult to conceptualize the best number of subdivisions for the watershed considering whether a layout will be classified as distributed or as lumped or as semi lumped however when following the stream ordering method as the basis for subcatchment delineation there were no combinations in between 16 subcatchment layout and 4 subcatchment layout options the layout with 16 major subcatchments with 16 intermittent storage subcatchments fig 4 layout b and layout with 4 major subcatchments with 4 intermittent storage subcatchments fig 4 layout c were considered as semi lumped layouts for this research the selected lumped layout was with one major catchment and one storage subcatchment which contains spatial aggregation of storage area approximations fig 4 layout d when observing the natural stream network of the karasnagala watershed and the contour pattern subcatchment for each single stream segment can be used with a minimum spatial aggregation however breaking into more subcatchments without calibrating each and every subcatchment is meaningless if the discharge measurements were available at each subcatchment level the fully distributed layout will be the best option if not it just increases the number of variables without intermittent check however when coming to modeling it was a tedious task to adjust each subcatchment parameters and stream network parameters at each model run time which in turn increased the model complexity when the modelling approach moves from the distributed to lumped the effect of the spatial aggregation of watershed parameters was a critical consideration 4 6 field approximations field approximation of subdivision level used stream bifurcations of the study area stream network for the model was established based on 1 10 000 topographic maps and satellite images also field verification of stream network was used to apply stream ordering method in this study the scientific method strahler 1964 was used to develop the stream network modeling with field approximations such as channel network arrangement lateral connections and intermittent storages should follow proper guidelines to represent the behaviour of the outflow hydrograph the absence of guidelines made it a challenging task the representation of the watershed characteristics in the model layout was the next challenge of this study trial and error cases were applied to identify the representative model layout quantitative representation and qualitative representation of the connectivity of the catchment intermittent storages were identified as the objectives of the layout parameter optimization then the conceptual model layout was developed to represent the spatially distributed intermittent storages and their connections to the major stream network the infiltration parameters of the catchment and physical parameters of the stream network were determined using field measurements for the model soil parameter approximations and the stream network geometry parameter approximations were verified through the field observations and with the literature support chow 1959 chow et al 2010 hunukumbura 2007 ritzema 1994 rossman 2009 there were no difficulties in approximations those parameter values can be identified as unique parameters corresponding to a particular watershed efforts and the experiences of above studies can provide the guidance but a modeler needs to control the layout parameters such as optimum number of subdivisions spatially distributed storages quantity and their connectivity to the stream network for optimum results therefore the most important component of this study was to identify representative swmm layout for the karasnagala watershed after the calibration and verification of epa swmm model for the karasnagala watershed effect of the selected field approximations were analysed 4 7 storage modelling significant volume difference and mismatching of recession curves in observed and modeled hydrographs were the major observations with optimum subdivision level and optimized model experimental parameters the reasons for the aforementioned behavior could be due to the model s quick response for the rainfall and misrepresentation of the catchment storages behavior a quick response is expected as epa swmm 5 was specially designed for urban stormwater modeling it was sufficiently modified with conceptual storage parameters to change the peak and the recession which describes the withdrawal of catchment water storage then the paddy area natural marshy lands and the connectivity of those areas to the stream network were modeled options for the intermittent storages modeling were tested with the node ponding option and detention storage option of epa swmm 5 0 the detention storage option can incorporate infiltration parameters and evaporation factors to the storage unit rossman 2009 however insignificant evaporation in a flooding situation with cloudy environments and the insignificant infiltration amount in the wet soil condition reduce the effectiveness of the detention storage option in the detention storage option subcatchment runoff pools up in the storage area and then releases through the defined outlet if the water depth exceeds the maximum depth of the storage unit water will pool up on top of it and release when capacity permits fig 5 however in real situations the water comes to the node first and if the maximum depth of the node exceeds the node will flood and pool on top of the node that flooded area may be the paddy land or marshy land close to the node when the capacity permits water is released from the flooded area to the node in the detention storage option this phenomena occurs in the reverse direction the node ponding option is conceptually closer to reality than the detention storage option therefore the node ponding option was used for the further modeling work catchment intermittent storages clustering and incorporating to the model layout were done according to the synthetic unit hydrograph theory accordingly the stream length along the longest stream lcpd the stream length from the centroid of the storage area to the intersection point perpendicular to the longest stream lp and the stream length from the centroid of the catchment to the intersection point perpendicular to the longest stream lc were defined fig 6 the influence of intermittent catchment storages on model output was assessed with four model schematic diagrams fig 7 further investigation of the intermittent storages behavior has been identified that the outlet control tool should be introduced to control the storage on the node the swmm weir tool was used as the outlet control tool four model schematic diagrams were defined as schematic diagram a with no storage options schematic diagram b with node storage direct connection schematic diagram c with optimized lcpd and lp and schematic diagram d with optimized lcpd and lp and weir 4 8 model calibration model calibration and verification were done using the observed runoff data in the model calibration the calibration parameters were divided into two categories controllable parameters and less controllable parameters the watershed parameters such as depression storage suction head saturated hydraulic conductivity initial deficit and channel roughness are less controllable parameters boundary values and the limitations pertaining to those parameters are defined by the literature hunukumbura 2007 rossman 2009 chow 1959 chow et al 2010 the model layout parameters such as intermittent storages and their connectivity to main stream network are controllable parameters the model layout optimization process shows the conversion of the mathematical watershed model which was developed for urban stormwater modeling into the regional watershed modeling when observing the results it is clear that adequate representation of the behaviour of the catchment intermittent storages in a model provided significant improvement of the hydrograph recession limb matching a summary of the parameter values obtained for calibration events are shown in table 4 numerical values were assigned for the lcpd and lp considering the average of the sixteen subcatchments values tables 2 and 3 show the average values used for the stream length optimization assessing the goodness of fit of a model is done with the use of objective functions the behaviour of the measure of the effectiveness of model output is described mathematically using objective functions it is important to identify the actual relationship between objective function variables and the measure of efficacy arsham 1994 setting up a meaningful objective function is usually a tedious task which follows a trial and error process the optimum parameters set minimizes the objective function that is discovered at the calibration process the failure of an objective function could occur due to the selections of a wrong set of variables 1 m r a e 1 n i 1 n q o b s i q s i m i q o b s i mrae provides the information about the predicting capability as well as the distribution of the prediction errors of the model the best fit between the observed and calculated values would be mrae 0 majority of events the error of observed and the simulated streamflow was always higher in the high streamflow region than that of the lower flow region baseflow rmse and mrae provide important information about the predictive capabilities of the model he et al 2014 the rmse measures the goodness of fit relevant to high rainfall values while the mrae provides more balanced perspective of the goodness of fit at a moderate value distribution of the estimation errors feng et al 2014 one observation while applying the nash sutcliffe ns efficiency is highlighting the mismatching of the peak flow region and relatively lower interpretation of the mismatching in lower flow values therefore mrae was selected as an objective function to evaluate the goodness of fit of the model 5 results 5 1 optimum number of subcatchments delineation comparison of the model generated outflow hydrograph of the fully distributed 16 subcatchment semi lumped 4 subcatchment semi lumped and fully lumped subcatchment model layouts for sample rainfall runoff event shows in fig 8 according to fig 8 major peak matching and poor matching of initial peaks have been achieved by the fully distributed layout a perfect initial peaks matching and poor matching of major peak have been achieved by four subcatchment semi lumped layout the optimization of modeling effort and modeling error has enabled the identification of optimum model layout for the karasnagala watershed fig 9 tables 5 and 6 show the recession curve mrae for schematic diagram a with no intermittent storages and schematic diagram d with optimized storage parameters figs 10 and 11 illustrate the improvement of the results model calibration shows the mean ratio of absolute error mrae 0 289 and 0 375 mrae for verification incorporation of intermittent storages with optimized model layout improved the outflow hydrograph recession curve matching mrae from 0 268 to 0 167 with no time lag 5 2 stream parameter approximation the effect for 15 sample events of the stream bed and bank roughness value when it varies 50 from the field estimated roughness value is shown in table 7 when consider the average difference it is less than 2 variation from the modeled streamflow peak for the optimized parameters also it is observed that the effect of the stream bed and bank roughness on the hydrograph peak is decreasing with the increment of the stream order 6 discussion the upstream and downstream storage area definition was based on the floodplain definition that depends on the catchment slope ded 2013 defines floodplain area as slope less than 4 when the catchment slope along the main stream of each subcatchment was analyzed storage areas contained within the floodplain are considered as downstream storage area and the rest is considered as upstream storage area in the iteration process the model calculates the next time step outputs based on the current time step results the continuous modeling will cause the accumulation of error and would be difficult to calibrate the model with finer resolution data therefore most of time continuous modeling use the coarser resolution data however in event based analysis each and every event has more degree of freedom to vary the flow governing parameters such as antecedent wetness and event model parameters also in continuous rainfall runoff modeling usually a spin up warm up period is used before the actual calibration to establish the model parameter to adjust to the current hydrological conditions with the spin up period the effects from initial values in continuous rainfall runoff modeling can be avoided however the determination of the spin up period is not clearly defined kaffas and hrissanthou 2014 comparing continuous and event based rainfall runoff modeling hossain et al 2019 concludes that event based modelling outperforms the continuous simulation approach therefore an event based approach was utilized in this study however event based modeling required reliable event separation criteria suitable for the study area there were no guidelines to determine the mit for the attanagalu oya catchment at the karasnagala the new approach proposed by this study is the approximation of the time base for one day duration unit hydrograph as the direct runoff duration of one day duration rainfall epa swmm 5 0 model recommends the hourly resolution rainfall data for the analysis therefore it avoids the loss of finer details of the outflow hydrograph of the model in the absence of finer resolution data this study used the daily resolution data however the majority of the events show the model generated outflow hydrograph pattern fluctuations is similar to the observed streamflow hydrograph that is due to the usage of optimum calculation time step considering the continuity equation and observing the model output details trial and error calculation time step adjustments can be used to identify the optimum calculation time step in the subcatchment delineation process field verified topographic map can be used as the base data after generating the stream network stream ordering can be used to define the subcatchments while keeping the required accuracy and the effort as the boundary conditions relative to the fully distributed model layout percentage increment of mrae in semi lumped 16 sub catchment model layout semi lumped 4 sub catchment model layout and single catchment fully lumped model layout are 21 74 73 69 and 165 94 respectively these values interpret the model performance in different field approximation levels of complex stream network and spatially distributed catchment parameters having karasnagala stream gauge as the only possibility to calibrate the model there is no point of moving into finer resolution distributed subcatchement delineation without intermittent verification at each subcatchment level singh and kumar 2017 terink et al 2018 therefore when selecting the study area it is recommend to check the possibility of intermittent verification at least for one small subcatchment within major catchment boundary wallner et al 2012 7 modeling errors and limitations during the field work a number of assumptions for the field parameter measurements and simpliﬁcations for the complex stream network were implemented to reduce the effort and time which can contribute to more errors in the model development the environmental protection agency which has developed this model recommended the application of swmm for the urban stormwater modeling also past modeling experiences of the researchers were focused on the application of swmm for urban stormwater modeling with sub daily resolution data however in this study with coarser resolution input rainfall data there was a possibility of losing important information of the model output hydrograph the precipitation data used were obtained from two rain gauge stations and thiessen averaged rainfall was applied uniformly over the catchment area theissen averaging identifies the theissen area factors for the karasnagala rain gauge and the vincit rain gauge as 0 21 and 0 79 respectively it clearly indicates the average rainfall is biased towards vincit gauging station due to the spatial variation of the rain gauges and the ambiguities in model calibration and verification reveals that the theissen averaging may not be the best method to identify the representative rainfall for the karasnagala stream gauge this may add errors to the model output the green ampt infiltration parameters were calculated by the area weighted average soil parameters and assumed to be uniform over the entire catchment also the vertical distribution of soil profile was assumed to be uniform in the unsaturated zone these assumptions can have a signiﬁcant impact on soil moisture characteristics 8 conclusions the outflow hydrograph recession limb and the hydrograph peak behaviour depend on the catchment storage representation method while initial peaks and the rising limb of the outflow hydrograph depend on the antecedent wetness which is controlled by the model infiltration parameters the key points identified from the field approximation of subcatchment delineation are that there is no combination between the 16 sub catchment model layout and semi lumped 4 sub catchment model layout and the effort of the 16 sub catchment model layout is marginally increased from the semi lumped 4 sub catchment model layout the effect of the stream bed and bank roughness on the hydrograph peak decreases with the increment of the stream order the main reason for this observation can be identified as the stream density usually the density of the lesser order streams is greater than that of the higher order streams the conclusions of this research are as follows 1 a qualitative evaluation of available models and the model development calibration verification revealed that epa swmm 5 can be used to develop a rural watershed model 2 the semi distributed 16 sub basin configuration is more appropriate and practical model configuration for the karasnagala catchment as this configuration only increases the error marginally compared to the fully distributed model configuration 3 the hydrograph recession limb matching is highly correlated with the watershed intermittent storage modeling approximations and calibration of the model conceptual parameters provided the best fitting of hydrograph recession limb with mrae 0 167 4 the effect of the stream bed and bank roughness on the hydrograph peak decreases with the increment of the stream order therefore bed and bank roughness approximation of head water streams or the lesser order streams should be done precisely when compared with higher order streams 5 the determination of the mit by the unit hydrograph method is a reliable and rational solution for any region with similar conditions of the karasnagala watershed in an event based modeling identification of the end time of an event is a subjective method it is recommend that further investigations on the defining mit by unit hydrograph method should be conducted to identify end time of an event declaration of competing interest i

actions and ecosystems response the following questioning is made how will environmental services be affected by land use management in a tropical dry forest 2 tropical dry forest a case study 2 1 study area soil and water are determinant factors in regional plant physiology and the resulting development of other forms of life provided the need to use natural resources for biomass and food production a study was developed in two paired catchments in the brazilian semi arid region to assess the land use management effect on systems resilience fig 4 local population has developed survival strategies based on the goods and services provided by the tropical dry forest of which the most relevant provisioning services are honey production and livestock raising that is improved upon forest thinning as a common management practice this management practice impact on other ecosystem services is understudied and it was the focus of this work a 10 year rainfall runoff and sediment data series 2008 2017 was obtained at both catchments by two automatic weather stations with 5 minute rain gauge recordings a parshall flume with an automatic depth of flow meter and suspended sediment samplers located at each catchment outlet annual average potential evapotranspiration is 1988 mm and annual rainfall in the study area is 867 mm of which 85 occur between january and may and 30 in the month of march even though in the brazilian semi arid region high intensity rainfall events occur in the wet season over 50 of the events in the region are below 15 mm andrade et al 2018a santos et al

the three main rain producing systems that act on the cpd are cold fronts the intertropical conversion zone itcz and the easterly waves fig 6 due to its location 2º54 s 16º18 s brazilian tdf has two well defined seasons a dry season and a wet season the wet season may last from two to six months being the length of the wet season dependent on the three rain producing systems andrade et al 2018a the water year in cpd begins in october when the cold fronts move towards the equator fig 6 and go as far as 14 south ferreira and mello 2005 most rainfall events concentrate in december and january the northern part of the cpd has a rainfall season from january to may with the biggest events occurring in march and april when the itcz moves towards the southern hemisphere down to 10 s during this period there is a vertical displacement of the hot humid air that associated with the itcz promotes convective rainfall events usually of high intensity without a defined periodicity alves et al 2009 sun et al 2007 these rainfall systems imprint great spatial and temporal variability to the region the wet season in the eastern region of the cpd from may to august is concentrated in the months of june and july the major rainfall events inducing sources are the easterly waves humid masses of air that travel in the lower tropospheric tradewinds across the atlantic ocean to the brazilian eastern coast torres and ferreira 2011 and the advection process of the sea breeze that travels over the continent when sea and atmospheric conditions are favorable to a major displacement of air masses these move over the central and northern region of the cpd and the rainy season may extend to the month of july or august guerreiro et al 2013 the dominant rainfall regime in the cpd shows high spatial and temporal variability and occurrence of dry spells cdd over an average of 53 days during the rainy season andrade et al 2016 average annual rainfall in the cpd is 751 mm table 2 with up to 70 of total annual rainfall occurring in one month andrade et al 2018a although approximately 200 000 km2 22 of the region show an annual rainfall below 600 mm table 2 76 of the territory lies between the 600 mm and 1200 mm isohyets and 1 6 of the area have an annual rainfall above 1200 mm this is a semi arid region in which rain falls but water scarcity occurs due to the high solar radiation intensity pereira et al 2017 and high spatial and temporal variation of rainfall events this high spatial variability of water resources promotes different microclimates within the cpd from a desert climate in the central part to a rainy climate in the coastal and mountain regions fig 7 due to an orographic effect a major mass of dry air in the cpd is located between latitudes 8 s and 11 s where annual rainfall is below 600 mm fig 7a the smaller rainfall values are determined by the influence of the three major rainfall induction sources in the region as cold air masses and or itcz displace towards this region these masses lose moisture in the form of rainfall and when they arrive they do not have enough moisture to generate significant rainfall the dry air mass of low rainfall spreads throughout the leeward region of the borborema plateau until the northern coast of the cpd fig 7b one of the strong characteristics of the rainfall regime in the cpd is rainfall event concentration in a short period two to five months with little rainfall registered during the dry season seven to ten months the northern and northeastern region of the cpd shows the highest rainfall concentration during the wet season fig 7b this concentration is determined by the strongest rainfall induction source in the northern part of the cpd itcz the time it takes for the itcz to move over the southern hemisphere and promote rainfall occurrence is little february to april in the month of may itcz recedes towards latitude 14 n and a hot dry air predominates over the cpd region with little probability of rainfall occurrence on average 84 of the total annual rainfall occurs during the wet season table 3 in 37 of the territory 91 of total annual precipitation is registered during the wet season an area of 509 674 km2 56 of the territory has 85 to 91 of total annual rainfall during the wet season and 78 of the territory from 85 to 94 of total annual rainfall occurs during the wet season table 3 and fig 7b this fact expresses the high rainfall concentration in a short period and the existence of a long dry period of high cdd this rainfall pattern generates a little window of climatic conditions for agricultural and or biomass production variability of major rainfall events increasing temperatures evaporation and evapotranspiration rates represent the immediate impact over water resources availability to ecosystems and agricultural production in dry regions alves et al 2009 the combination of these factors results in more frequent extreme droughts and floods as well as more continuous dry days cdd during the wet season major occurrence of cdds or dry spells has been observed in long term studies on rainfall in dry regions guerreiro et al 2013 santos et al 2017b affecting directly soil moisture content and agricultural productivity 2 3 hydrological processes 2 3 1 surface runoff in dry regions of the world land use management seeks more water availability for the biogeochemical processes of the watershed water availability will be augmented by reducing surface runoff and increasing water retention in the soil land use management that increases surface roughness will decrease surface flow velocity and increase water infiltration opportunity water infiltration not only supplies vegetation water needs but also reduces the erosive process due to surface flow on the first year of the case study data collection when the two catchments maintained similar cover vegetation regenerating tropical dry forest runoff presented high similarity table 4 this was an expected result since both areas have the same soil type textural class geomorphology and slopes table 1 after thinning of vegetation in one of the catchments in 2009 less runoff was produced in the thinned vegetation catchment table 4 this result shows the effect of the protecting underbrush arnau rosalén et al 2008 atucha et al 2013 composed by grasses a shrub saplings that developed due to the higher solar radiation penetration after thinning and resulting germination of the seed bank present in tropical dry forests this increased underbrush development promotes natural barriers to runoff and dissipates the rainfall and surface flow kinetic energy andrade et al 2018b santos et al 2017b it follows that biomass production as an element for hydrologic connectivity disruption santos et al 2016b maximizes the opportunity for rainfall to infiltrate increasing soil moisture content urgeghe et al 2010 and providing water for biomass production and evapotranspiration processes as supported by yang et al 2014 2 3 2 soil moisture total or partial removal of vegetation cover changes the hydrologic behavior of a catchment partial removal when adequately performed may reduce surface flow and sediment transport if during vegetation thinning the thinnest branches are left on the soil fig 5b surface roughness will increase as will available organic matter vegetation develops at the beginning of the wet season and increases soil roughness which in addition to the plant residues left during the thinning process reduces surface flow and increases infiltration vegetation management contributed to an increase in soil moisture content by 11 in the ttdf fig 8 the underbrush significantly p 0 05 increased soil moisture fig 8a provided both catchments have similar geomorphologic and soil characteristics the soil moisture increase must be due to the land use change the underbrush associated with the canopy promotes an increase in initial losses andrade et al 2017b with an increase in infiltration and increase in soil moisture content aquino et al 2017 urgeghe et al 2010 arnau rosalén et al arnau rosalén et al 2008 showed that the underbrush and rock fragments at the surface increases infiltration the increase in soil moisture in the thinned catchment is associated to a better soil structure development by the root system of the underbrush which favors the development of preferential flow paths pinheiro et al 2013 and an increase in organic matter from the biomass production the thinned catchment showed higher values for soil moisture content most above the 1 1 line fig 8b 2 3 3 soil erosion soil erosion due to inadequate use of the soil is an almost irreversible process the most common way of breaking the equilibrium between the erosive forces erosivity and soil resistance erodibility is the direct exposure of the soil to erosive agents rain and wind one factor that may contribute to the erosive process is the arrangement of the bare soil areas as well as their dimensions bare areas that are connected and or with dimensions that allow preferential flow ways will provide a greater risk for soil erosion as well as nutrient loss and infiltration reduction underbrush shows greater potential at reducing soil loss rodrigues et al 2013 because it dissipates the energy flux of surface flow fig 5c an adequate way to avoid soil degradation by the erosive process is by adopting best management practices filho 2013 li et al 2013 that control not only the erosion but also regulate ecosystem services these practices control runoff increase soil moisture and organic soil carbon contents and biomass production two land use management ttdf and rtdf40 have been studied since 2008 in the semi arid brazilian region and show that when adequately managed may contribute to regulating ecosystem services thinning of native vegetation promoted the development of a dense herbaceous stratum underbrush fig 5c positively interfering with other ecohydrological processes this increase of underbrush promoted an increase in surface soil roughness reduction of surface flow by 22 in the ttdf area relative to the rtdf40 the flow reduction table 4 and resulting lower energy for mass transport reduced sediment yield on the ttdf 29 smaller than the yield of the rtdf40 table 5 2 3 4 carbon sink tropical dry forests have smaller biomass production pereira et al 2016 when compared to humid tropical forests ngo et al 2013 and a smaller total organic carbon toc stock potential in the plant atmosphere system despite tdf s smaller storage potential management techniques may increase biomass production and or soil moisture that will favor toc stock either by living biomass or by organic matter incorporation in the soil through aggregates lal 2015 water and soil conservation techniques and vegetation management increase water availability by promoting above and belowground biomass production aquino et al 2017 and reduce soil loss by erosive processes these processes contribute to toc stock in the soil lal 2015 2004 subsidizing a more efficient and resilient system hong et al 2018 fig 1 hence priority actions to increase resilience to climate change should be based on promotion of water retention in the soil conservation of degraded areas and toc increase the little research on vegetation thinning in tropical dry forests is focused on rangeland productivity and small flock s nutrition filho 2013 pereira filho et al 2013 these studies show little research on the interactions between the hydrologic processes soil and carbon plant flux and stock a cross and holistic view of these interactions lead to questioning if toc stock in a tropical dry forest subject to thinning is smaller than in a tropical dry forest under a regenerating process for 40 years on the soil surface layer soil toc stock showed no difference between both land uses p 0 01 fig 9 nonetheless at the lower layers rtdf40 showed a smaller and significant difference for toc stock fig 9 a major carbon concentration on the surface layer was also identified by gelaw et al 2014 upon studying carbon stock in a semi arid region in northern ethiopia haile et al haile et al 2008 in a silvopastoral system in florida and aticho aticho 2013 in kafa southwestern ethiopia hence a high soil carbon storage at the soil surface suggests a higher risk of co2 release from the soil surface to the atmosphere upon land use conversion from less soil mobilizing management systems to soil turning lal 2004 tiessen et al 1998 2 4 biomass primary energy gain through herbaceous biomass production by land use management has been practiced for decades araújo filho et al 2002 bovey et al 1971 pereira filho et al 1997 for subsistence agriculture disregarding other assets potential biomass production should be promoted where other ecosystem services are being implemented expressing the complementary relationship between goods and ecosystem services dubbert et al 2014 singh et al 2013 to promote system resilience and increase goods and services in tropical dry climates where hydric deficit occurs throughout the year land use should be managed to increase biomass production palácio 2011 with a resulting reduction in surface flow and increase in infiltration rate rodrigues et al 2013 the short phenological cycle of the herbaceous vegetation imposes sensitivity to the rainfall regime in these regions on preserved and thinned tropical dry forest vegetation rainfall seasonality showed significant influence p 0 05 on herbaceous biomass production fig 10 a the decrease in biomass during the dry season results from individual s senescence due to moisture decrease in the soil nonetheless during the wet season thinned vegetation showed higher biomass production 1 23 mg ha 1 when compared to regenerating vegetation 1 00 mg ha 1 as was verified by yang et al 2014 the reduction of tree crown cover with a 55 68 shrub decrease resulted in an increase of 1600 of underbrush bovey et al 1971 as the thinning management practice provides more solar energy flux for the photosynthetic process of the underbrush located under the tree crowns fig 5c the effort involved in root system data acquisition in forests limits knowledge on root dynamics in the soil maeght et al 2015 on underbrush root biomass and its role in carbon flux and carbon storage pereira et al 2016 herbaceous root systems upload organic matter to the soil due to its short phenological cycle thin roots and fast decomposition vegetation returns nutrients to the soil through matter circulation like leaf mulch deposition and root decay especially the thin roots morris et al 2016 schneider and lynch 2018 this major distribution of thin roots in the soil in areas with predominant herbaceous vegetation allows an increase and release of soluble compounds by exudation or root decay easily used as a source of energy by microorganisms kuzyakov and domanski 2000 pinheiro et al 2013 root biomass production in tropical dry forests is related to the dry and wet seasons allen et al 2017 on both the thinned or regenerating vegetation catchment fig 10b under both land uses biomass production may be significantly higher during the wet season fig 10b as identified in a tropical dry forest in northeastern brazil aquino et al 2017 araújo filho et al 2002 palácio 2011 the protective effect of underbrush biomass may be stronger in years of rainfall below average like 2016 and 2017 where runoff was up to eight times smaller in the thinned catchment annual herbaceous plants have a faster turnover than perennial plants a fast turnover stimulates soil organic matter enrichment and consequent carbon storage contributing to local actions on climate change mitigation there was a reduction in trees and shrubs biomass production in the ttdf catchment although total biomass production was maintained a total of 9664 mg ha 1 in the rtdf40 and 9818 mg ha in the ttdf catchment fig 11 sustainability was not compromised by forest thinning as also concluded by palacio et al 2013 3 ecosystem services the brazilian tropical dry forest as well as other forests of the globe provide direct ecosystem services such as food for humans livestock and wild animals in fruits roots fish game and honey energy in firewood coal and waste fibers in wood and ropes etc this forest provides all these direct services to the region s 27 million people distributed in rural communities and supply services that regulate the environmental conditions that support life such as air purification climate and water resources erosion control carbon stock among others services must be provided such as to enable communities to survive sustainably in face of the constraints imposed by the forest itself quantification of how land use management improves ecosystem services may help support management practices that improve quality of life in a sustainable way forest thinning in a tropical dry forest in a semi arid region may improve ecosystem services in provisioning by increasing biomass production increasing organic matter and consequently increasing the source of carbohydrates for wild and domestic animals and protein for local population provisioning services are also improved by offering timber and biofuel as energy sources and increasing soil water storage that will promote biomass production regulation services are also improved by forest thinning reducing runoff soil erosion and nutrient losses the ecohydrological processes are strongly associated and seeking balance where biomass availability generates barriers to runoff which promotes soil water retention and maximizes biomass production supporting services such as maintenance of vegetative genetic diversity upon forest thinning for this management practice reduces the number of trees but does not eliminate the species cultural services experiential learning experiences are being valued by people of the most distinguished biomes around the globe these experiences favor social and cultural development in an environmental context promoting a sense of place and identity with the ecosystem in the study area communities residents organized meetings with researchers and students fig 12 to actively learn about local plants and animals in tropical dry forests it is a way of educating the new generations about the cultural heritage represented by these forests for the region and the people that live there given the growth of world population the demand for goods and ecosystem services has promoted a strong pressure on natural resources in the last two decades services provided by nature to humans fig 1 has been debated in the search for acknowledgement of the need to use natural resources in a sustainable way 4 concluding remarks ecohydrology should be considered as a series of interdependent complementary and symbiotic processes to be offered as ecosystemic goods and services and resilient to unfavorable climatic conditions an ecohydrological view on natural resources will bring maturity to the science and may contribute to mitigation of the changing climate effects on dry tropical forests forest thinning is a vegetation management technique that may improve ecosystem services such as surface flow reduction that contributes to water storage under higher soil moisture contents less intense erosive processes by increasing groundcover does not affect biomass production and improves stocked soil carbon it is of the utmost importance to identify and implement adequate public policies for transferring scientific knowledge to practical technical actions that will contribute to the increase in ecosystem services resilience to benefit the final user hence there is a need to adopt a paradigm shift where scientific results developed in academia and research centers are translated and transferred to the users and raise awareness on the possibility to mitigate the climate changes effects and improve provided goods and services declaration of competing interest the authors declare

impact on ecosystem services believing that future studies and policy decisions should follow an ecosystemic approach and should focus on the interactions between the hydrologic functions human actions and ecosystems response the following questioning is made how will environmental services be affected by land use management in a tropical dry forest 2 tropical dry forest a case study 2 1 study area soil and water are determinant factors in regional plant physiology and the resulting development of other forms of life provided the need to use natural resources for biomass and food

strategies based on the goods and services provided by the tropical dry forest of which the most relevant provisioning services are honey production and livestock raising that is improved upon forest

soil areas as well as their dimensions bare areas that are connected and or with dimensions that allow preferential flow ways will provide a greater risk for soil erosion as well as nutrient loss and infiltration reduction underbrush shows greater potential at reducing soil loss rodrigues et al 2013 because it dissipates the energy flux of surface flow fig 5c an adequate way to avoid soil degradation by the erosive process is by adopting best management practices filho 2013 li et al 2013 that control not only the erosion but also regulate ecosystem services these practices control runoff increase soil moisture and organic soil carbon contents and biomass production two land use management ttdf and rtdf40 have been studied since 2008 in the semi arid brazilian region and show that when adequately managed may contribute to regulating ecosystem services thinning of native vegetation promoted the development of a dense herbaceous stratum underbrush fig 5c positively interfering with other ecohydrological processes this increase of underbrush promoted an increase in surface soil roughness reduction of surface flow by 22 in the ttdf area relative to the rtdf40 the flow reduction table 4 and resulting lower energy for mass transport reduced sediment yield on the ttdf 29 smaller than the yield of the rtdf40 table 5 2 3 4 carbon sink tropical dry forests have smaller biomass production pereira et al 2016 when compared to humid tropical forests ngo et al 2013 and a smaller total organic carbon toc stock potential in the plant atmosphere system despite tdf s smaller storage potential management techniques may increase biomass production and or soil moisture that will favor toc stock either by living biomass or by organic matter incorporation in the soil through aggregates lal 2015 water and soil conservation techniques and vegetation management increase water availability by promoting above and belowground biomass production aquino et al 2017 and reduce soil loss by erosive processes these processes contribute to toc stock in the soil lal 2015 2004 subsidizing a more efficient and resilient system hong et al 2018 fig 1 hence priority actions to increase resilience to climate change should be based on promotion of water retention in the soil conservation of degraded areas and toc increase the little research on vegetation thinning in tropical dry forests is focused on rangeland productivity and small flock s nutrition filho 2013 pereira filho et al 2013 these studies show little research on the interactions between the hydrologic processes soil and carbon plant flux and stock a cross and holistic view of these interactions lead to questioning if toc stock in a tropical dry forest subject to thinning is smaller than in a tropical dry forest under a regenerating process for 40 years on the soil surface layer soil toc stock showed no difference between both land uses p 0 01 fig 9 nonetheless at the lower layers rtdf40 showed a smaller and significant difference for toc stock fig 9 a major carbon concentration on the surface layer was also identified by gelaw et al 2014 upon studying carbon stock in a semi arid region in northern ethiopia haile et al haile et al 2008 in a silvopastoral system in florida and aticho aticho 2013 in kafa southwestern ethiopia hence a high soil carbon storage at the soil surface suggests a higher risk of co2 release from the soil surface to the atmosphere upon land use conversion from less soil mobilizing management systems to soil turning lal 2004 tiessen et al 1998 2 4 biomass primary energy gain through herbaceous biomass production by land use management has been practiced for decades araújo filho et al 2002 bovey et al 1971 pereira filho et al 1997 for subsistence agriculture disregarding other assets potential biomass production should be promoted where other ecosystem services are being implemented expressing the complementary relationship between goods and ecosystem services dubbert et al 2014 singh et al 2013 to promote system resilience and increase goods and services in tropical dry climates where hydric deficit occurs throughout the year land use should be managed to increase biomass production palácio 2011 with a resulting reduction in surface flow and increase in infiltration rate rodrigues et al 2013 the short phenological cycle of the herbaceous vegetation imposes sensitivity to the rainfall regime in these regions on preserved and thinned tropical dry forest vegetation rainfall seasonality showed significant influence p 0 05 on herbaceous biomass production fig 10 a the decrease in biomass during the dry season results from individual s senescence due to moisture decrease in the soil nonetheless during the wet season thinned vegetation showed higher biomass production 1 23 mg ha 1 when compared to regenerating vegetation 1 00 mg ha 1 as was verified by yang et al 2014 the reduction of tree crown cover with a 55 68 shrub decrease resulted in an increase of 1600 of underbrush bovey et al 1971 as the thinning management practice provides more solar energy flux for the photosynthetic process of the underbrush located under the tree crowns fig 5c the effort involved in root system data acquisition in forests limits knowledge on root dynamics in the soil maeght et al 2015 on underbrush root biomass and its role in carbon flux and carbon storage pereira et al 2016 herbaceous root systems upload organic matter to the soil due to its short phenological cycle thin roots and fast decomposition vegetation returns nutrients to the soil through matter circulation like leaf mulch deposition and root decay especially the thin roots morris et al 2016 schneider and lynch 2018 this major distribution of thin roots in the soil in areas with predominant herbaceous vegetation allows an increase and release of soluble compounds by exudation or root decay easily used as a source of energy by microorganisms kuzyakov and domanski 2000 pinheiro et al 2013 root biomass production in tropical dry forests is related to the dry and wet seasons allen et al 2017 on both the thinned or regenerating vegetation catchment fig 10b under both land uses biomass production may be significantly higher during the wet season fig 10b as identified in a tropical dry forest in northeastern brazil aquino et al 2017 araújo filho et al 2002 palácio 2011 the protective effect of underbrush biomass may be stronger in years of rainfall below average like 2016 and 2017 where runoff was up to eight times smaller in the thinned catchment annual herbaceous plants have a faster turnover than perennial plants a fast turnover stimulates soil organic matter enrichment and consequent carbon storage contributing to local actions on climate change mitigation there was a reduction in trees and shrubs biomass production in the ttdf catchment although total biomass production was maintained a total of 9664 mg ha 1 in the rtdf40 and 9818 mg ha in the ttdf catchment fig 11 sustainability was not compromised by forest thinning as also concluded by palacio et al 2013 3 ecosystem services the brazilian tropical dry forest as well as other forests of the globe provide direct ecosystem services such as food for humans livestock and wild animals in fruits roots fish game and honey energy in firewood coal and waste fibers in wood and ropes etc this forest provides all these direct services to the region s 27 million people distributed in rural communities and supply services that regulate the environmental conditions that support life such as air purification climate and water resources erosion control carbon stock among others services must be provided such as to enable communities to survive sustainably in face of the constraints imposed by the forest itself quantification of how land use management improves ecosystem services may help support management practices that improve quality of life in a sustainable way forest thinning in a tropical dry forest in a semi arid region may improve ecosystem services in provisioning by increasing biomass production increasing organic matter and consequently increasing the source of carbohydrates for wild and domestic animals and protein for local population provisioning services are also improved by offering timber and biofuel as energy sources and increasing soil water storage that will promote biomass production regulation services are also improved by forest thinning reducing runoff soil erosion and nutrient losses the ecohydrological processes are strongly associated and seeking balance where biomass availability generates barriers to runoff which promotes soil water retention and maximizes biomass production supporting services such as maintenance of vegetative genetic diversity upon forest thinning for this management practice reduces the number of trees but does not eliminate the species cultural services experiential learning experiences are being valued by people of the most distinguished biomes around the globe these experiences favor social and cultural development in an environmental context promoting a sense of place and identity with the ecosystem in the study area communities residents organized meetings with researchers and students fig 12 to actively learn about local plants and animals in tropical dry forests it is a way of educating the new generations about the cultural heritage represented by these forests for the region and the people that live there given the growth of world population the demand for goods and ecosystem services has promoted a strong pressure on natural resources in the last two decades services provided by nature to humans fig 1 has been debated in the search for acknowledgement of the need to use natural resources in a sustainable way 4 concluding remarks ecohydrology should be considered as a series of interdependent complementary and symbiotic processes to be offered as ecosystemic goods and services and resilient to unfavorable climatic conditions an ecohydrological view on natural resources will bring maturity to the science and may contribute to mitigation of the changing climate effects on dry tropical forests forest thinning is a vegetation management technique that may improve ecosystem services such as surface flow reduction that contributes to water storage under higher soil moisture contents less intense erosive processes by increasing groundcover does not affect biomass production and improves stocked soil carbon it is of the utmost importance to identify and implement adequate public policies for transferring scientific knowledge to practical technical actions that will contribute to the increase in ecosystem services resilience to benefit the final user hence there is a need to adopt a paradigm shift where scientific results developed in academia and research centers are translated and transferred to the users and raise awareness on the possibility to mitigate the climate changes effects and improve provided goods and services declaration of competing interest the authors declare

8387,study region burabay national nature park bnnp of north kazakhstan is located between humid boreal forests and an arid steppe of central asia study focus the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope analyses of precipitation stream lake and ground waters were used for water budget calculations of the bnnp endorheic lake system to assess the impact of increasing aridity on lakes in this most continental part of the earth new hydrological insights for the region the stable isotope results confirmed two different types of lakes in bnnp burabay and shortandy lakes are more similar to higher latitude lakes e g south siberia while kishi and ulken shabakty lakes are more comparable to the steppe lakes of central asia the slopes of evaporation lines for this region obtained by regression analysis of lake water samples ranged from 4 57 steppe lakes to 6 21 forest lakes the evaporation over inflow ratios 0 34 burabay 0 69 ulken shabakty and 0 53 shortandy are in good agreement with catchment water budget calculations reflecting different groundwater inputs and water retention times the recent water level rise in the ulken shabakty lake terminal basin was observed for the first time in a decade this increase can be explained by the fill and spill hypothesis and suggest that a single unusually wet year may significantly replenish water resources despite long term increasing aridity of the region keywords endorheic lake evaporation fill and spill water balance stable isotopes groundwater 1 introduction the quantification of hydrological processes governing the water balance of lakes is a challenging task especially in lake systems with heterogeneous geology and complex climate controls in most areas especially in cold semi arid regions there are two critical processes determining lake hydrology 1 open water evaporation and 2 lateral inflow outflow of shallow groundwater and surface water to lakes both evaporation and groundwater flows are the invisible fluxes that are difficult to quantify in addition in arid and semi arid environments open water evaporation is frequently the dominant factor determining the water loss in lakes lake evaporation is usually estimated applying micrometeorological equations such as the penman method driven by local weather data mcmahon et al 2013 the results of the theoretical calculations are often verified by pan evaporation observation or micrometeorological measurements in the field finch and calver 2008 mcjannet et al 2017 mcmahon et al 2013 using eddy covariance equipment mounted downwind of the lakes on flux towers or installed on the lake on buoys vessels or small islands xiao et al 2018 the lateral interactions of groundwater with lakes can be measured directly using groundwater seepage meters ala aho et al 2013 boyle 1994 but are usually investigated with measurements of hydraulic potentials in the watershed subsurface system combined with numerical modeling tools krabbenhoft et al 1994 shaw et al 2013 these traditional methods require constant long term monitoring of vapor fluxes or water levels as well as detailed information on subsurface and aquifer parameters these data are notoriously difficult to obtain in geologically heterogeneous watersheds in particular in remote locations hence these methods are logistically and methodologically challenging time consuming and costly the alternative tracer methods such as the analysis of the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition of water stable water isotopes swi have been widely utilized in lake water balance studies to identify both the evaporative losses and groundwater inputs on all continents gibson et al 2008 however only a few studies using this approach have been conducted to improve the understanding of lake water budgets in central asia therefore swi data are very limited for surface waters groundwaters and precipitation in central asia a region that is subjected to the most continental climate globally sun et al 2017 wang et al 2016 mizota et al 2009 in their study of the lake chany complex in western siberia based on water stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes and stable sulfur isotope compositions concluded that increasing salinity for these lakes is primarily driven by direct lake water evaporation oberhänsli et al 2009 estimated the water budget of the aral sea using swi and confirmed that both evaporative losses and groundwater inflows are significant water balance components for this large lake that has suffered a considerable decline in water levels since the 1960s micklin 2016 ma et al 2018 recently reported swi composition of the large high altitude basin of issyk kul lake inferring intensive surface water evaporation under low relative humidity lakes in arid central asia are particularly vulnerable to climate change and their water levels are in decline pekel et al 2016 yapiyev et al 2017a in this study we present our conclusions on water budget changes in a series of lakes located in the endorheic watersheds of burabay national nature park bnnp in the cold semi arid part of northern central asia kazakhstan and which reflect continental conditions for the region located between boreal siberia and arid central asia previous studies provided a deeper understanding of the drivers of the lake level fluctuations observed in bnnp over the last 100 years yapiyev et al 2019 2017b the main purpose of the current study was to a verify our previous long term observations and improve the bnnp lake water budgets using the stable isotope mass balance imb and b identify hydrological connectivity and lateral interactions of lakes with their watersheds using stable isotopic tracers the overarching aim of this study was to improve our understanding of water cycle in this under researched cold semi arid environment of central asia 2 theory 2 1 stable isotope mass balance the water balance of a well mixed lake under steady state conditions no significant water volume reductions can be estimated from the stable isotope mass balance imb model 1 i l q l e l m 3 s 1 2 δ i δ q δ e where il is all water inputs to the lake surface and groundwater inflow from the catchment and precipitation over the lake q l is surface or groundwater outflow from the lake e l is lake evaporation δ i δ q a n d δ e are the stable isotope compositions of inflow outflow and evaporation flux gibson et al 2017 yi et al 2008 for a typical well mixed lake under steady conditions we can assume that δ q δ l see gibson et al 2016 yi et al 2008 for details where δ l is the isotopic composition of the lake with this substitution in eq 2 we can estimate evaporation over inflow ratio e l i l using only isotopic compositions of water balance components 3 e l i l δ i δ l δ e δ l d i m e n s i o n l e s s while δ l can be measured by sampling lake or outflowing water and δ i can be estimated from isotopic analysis of precipitation and the other water inflows to the lake δ e can only be estimated indirectly the evaporative signature of vapors δ e from a reservoir such as a lake for a particular period can be estimated using the craig gordon model craig and gordon 1965 gibson et al 2016 yi et al 2008 4 δ e δ l ε α h δ a ε k 1 h 10 3 ε k here h is the relative humidity of the atmosphere as fraction δ a is the stable isotope

kinetic isotopic fractionation defined as ε k 1 h c k where c k is kinetic separation constant 12 5 for δ2 h and 14 2 for δ 18o gonfiantini 1986 horita et al 2008 note in eq 4 h and ε are in decimal notation by combining eqs 3 and 4 following gibson and reid 2014 we find 5 e l i l δ l δ i m δ δ l where m is a dimensionless calculation factor 6 m h ε 1000 1 h ε k 1000 with ε the total fractionation factor 7 ε ε α ε k and δ is the limiting stable isotope composition enrichment the threshold defining the limit of isotopic enrichment by evaporation 8 δ h δ a ε h ε 1000 2 2 local evaporation lines the stable isotope composition of water derived from the lakes in a particular region plotted in δ 18o vs δ 2h space defines the local evaporation line lel strictly speaking this is an approximation a lel is a true evaporation line if there are no other water inputs apart from direct precipitation over the lake the lels are usually derived by fitting the surface water sample data using regression analysis however lel slopes slel can be calculated theoretically based on swi data such as surface water atmospheric composition and precipitation and relative humidity gat 1995 gibson et al 2008 slel is primarily a function of humidity and ambient moisture stable isotope composition there are two common formulations to calculate slel 1 gat 1998 eq 9 and 2 predicted by the craig gordon model gibson et al 2008 eq 10 9 s l e l 1 h δ a δ l ε 2 h h δ a δ l ε 18 o 10 s l e l 2 h 10 3 δ a 10 3 δ p 1 10 3 δ p 10 3 ε h 10 3 ε 2 h h 10 3 δ a 10 3 δ p 1 10 3 δ p 10 3 ε h 10 3 ε 18 o where all variables are as described above note in eqs 9 and 10 h is given as a fraction gat s equation s l e l 1 eq 9 takes into account both the isotopic composition of the ambient atmosphere δ a and lake water δ l while eq 10 s l e l 2 uses δ a and δ p thus s l e l 2 depends on atmospheric conditions only while s l e l 1 is influenced by the isotopic composition of lake water and reflects different inputs such as snowmelt and groundwater the slel for the lakes in temperate regions usually ranges from 4 to 6 gibson et al 2008 3 materials and methods 3 1 study site bnnp is located in northern kazakhstan 53 n 70 e 300 400 msl see fig 1 a the climate in bnnp is cold semi arid with the snow cover period lasting from mid november to mid april long term 1986 2016 potential evapotranspiration pet is 750 mm year 1 and precipitation p is 330 mm year 1 yapiyev et al 2019 2017b thus the aridity index ai defined as the ratio of mean annual p to mean annual pet is 0 44 climatologically bnnp belongs to the transition zone between cold energy limited northern siberia and the water limited drylands of central asia the bnnp area is dominated by westerly winds that are characteristic for wider northern central asia yapiyev et al 2017b air temperature and precipitation peak in july summer mean 17 c in shuchinsk see fig 1a the summer precipitation constituting around half of the annual total for this region mostly comes from recycled evaporation derived from winter precipitation in continental eurasia located to the west and the north numaguti 1999 bnnp catchments are in the esil tobyl river basin draining into the irtysh river in the ob river basin yapiyev et al 2019 2017b the kokshetau ridge encircling the study area creates conditions for higher precipitation relative to the surrounding flat steppe the ridge acts as a small water tower encouraging orographic rainfall yapiyev et al 2017b bnnp lakes have tectonic origins and differ from the common pan lakes found in the surrounding region see also fig 1b in this study we investigated four lakes burabay shortandy kishi shabakty and ulken shabakty table 1 fig 1 burabay and shortandy are freshwater forest lakes ulken and kishi shabakty have more distinct features of steppe lakes with higher salinity see table 1 yapiyev et al 2017b limnologically bnnp lakes can be classified as cold continuous polymictic uryvaev 1959 the nature of these lakes which are well mixed throughout the year makes them particularly suitable for a stable isotope study brooks et al 2014 3 2 sampling design the water samples for swi analyses 54 in total see table 3 were collected during one hydrologic year from november 2015 to november 2016 lake water samples were collected approximately each month during the ice free period to the capture evaporation signal and groundwater streamwater samples were collected quarterly the water samples were collected in duplicate for each site in 20 ml borosilicate glass scintillation vials with screw caps wheaton science products usa part no 986542 immediately after collection all samples were sealed with parafilm m bemis company usa part no pm 992 to avoid evaporation the samples were stored at room temperature until analysis the lake water samples were collected by grab sampling at the shoreline at fixed locations see table 3 and fig 1a the lake water was sampled at approximately monthly intervals from the start of the open water season end of april to the first days of november 2016 which was about one week before permanent ice cover ice on snow samples collected near lake shortandy fig 1a near aws davis were melted in a sealed container at room temperature rainfall samples were collected at kazakh state hydrometeorological agency kazhydromet weather station near ulken shabakty lake fig 1a sampling point burabay the rainfall samples were collected during abundant precipitation events using a large plastic container and immediately transferred into the vials and sealed groundwater samples were collected from boreholes grdw1 4 fig 1a using a bailer groundwater was sampled during the open water season at approximately three month intervals end of april mid july and end of october 2016 stream samples fig 1a were collected at approximately the same times as groundwater samples following the same sampling procedure used for lake water samples prior to analysis all samples were stored in the dark at room temperature 3 3 stable isotope analyses of water before analysis the samples were filtered into 2 ml screw top vials with ptfe caps thermo scientific chromacol usa part no 2 cv a st cp through a disposable hydrophilic 0 45 μm ptfe syringe filter millex merc millipore ireland part no slcr025ns to remove suspended impurities the samples were analyzed at the global institute for water security mcdonnell watershed hydrology laboratory saskatchewan canada on a liquid water isotope analyzer los gatos research the analyzer uses liquid water off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy off axis icos and has an uncertainty of 1 0 for δ 2h and 0 2 for δ 18o the following reference materials were used to normalize obtained values to vsmow international scale saskatoon snow melt water ssmw δ 2h 200 4 δ 18o 26 1 and enriched δ 2h 3 2 δ 18o 0 3 all samples were tested for volatile organic

agency weather station located on the northern shore of ulken shabakty lake see fig 1a burabay weather station kazhydromet also surveys lake water levels taking measurements daily at 8 00 and 20 00 in lakes burabay shortandy and ulken shabakty using a graduated vertical staff gauge and a geodetic level referencing to a gauge datum mean sea level msl wgs84 a wireless automatic weather station aws vantage pro2 plus model 6163 davis instruments inc with integrated sensor suite was installed in november 2013 on the shore of shortandy lake 52 59 19 87 n 70 13 6 48 e fig 1a the station was mounted

shield relative humidity sensor a solar radiation sensor cup anemometer for wind direction and speed all sensors manufactured by davis instruments inc measurements were recorded at 30 minute intervals and averaged to daily values the groundwater monitoring boreholes fig 1a table 3 were located close to shortandy lake grdw 1 and in burabay lake watershed grdw 2 3 and 4 all boreholes are situated at a higher elevation relative to the lakes table 3 grdw 4 is located in the vicinity of the origin of sary bulak river fig 1a groundwater in this part of bnnp is very fresh 0 07 0 40 g l 1 dominated by bicarbonate and sulphate anions similarly to burabay and shortandy lake water dosumov et al 2014 see fig 1b and table 1 3 5 auxiliary data only a few precipitation samples were available for stable isotope analyses in bnnp see table 3 the monthly swi composition of precipitation necessary for imb modeling was downloaded from waterisotopes org bowen 2018 using bnnp coordinates and mean elevation latitude 52 99 n longitude 70 22 e altitude 300 m there are no swi precipitation data available nearby bnnp from the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip database international atomic

stable isotope hydrocalculator firstly we applied a long term lake water balance wb method for the hydrological year of 2015 2016 i e from the ice on of the antecedent year to ice on of the following year where we calculated lake water balance for lakes and their watersheds separately see yapiyev et al 2019 11 s p l w y e l where δs is a change in lake water storage pl precipitation over the lake wy catchment water yield surface and groundwater inflow to the lake including the gain from precipitation falling on the catchment land area or the depth equivalent runoff and el the lake evaporation all wb components are in mm of water per year briefly to obtain annual catchment water yield w y for each lake we subtracted actual evapotranspiration from catchment a e t obtained using budyko curve see section 3 5 2 in yapiyev et al 2019 for details from station precipitation p then multiplied it by ratio catchment lake surface area r s a see table 1 summing p l and w y provides total inflow i l to the lake the outflow is annual ice free e l for the year 2016 as obtained from the our previous work yapiyev et al 2019 the difference between total inflow and outflow for bnnp outflow e l provides an estimate of water storage change for 2016 in this case 12 e l i l e l p l w y secondly we used daily lake levels ll measurements and annual e l see above to estimate all the water inputs to the lake i l and e l i l lake level change δ ll denotes the water storage change as bnnp lakes are endpoints for all water excess in their catchments 13 e l i l e l e l δ l l in order to correctly account for all incoming water fluxes to the lakes we assessed δ ll from the perspective of a hydrological year this way we subtracted ll recorded on 1 november 2015 from ll recorded on 31 october 2016 kazhydromet measurement at 1 cm precision finally we calculated imb using the stable isotope results and the meteorological data using the hydrocalculator skrzypek et al 2015 software based on a modified craig gordon model e l i l was estimated based on the initial pool volume value or inflow defined in hydrocalculator as δ p but here as δ i the final stable isotope composition of water in a lake or reservoir δ l precipitation δ rain relative humidity and air temperature the e l i l ratio and slope of lel for each lake at the beginning sampling 1 and the end of open water season sampling

daily relative humidity decimal fraction and air temperatures c for sampling campaigns 1 and 2 from burabay s weather station for kishi shabakty and ulken shabakty lakes and aws davis for shortandy

versus lel bennett et al 2008 proposed adjusting δ a accounting for its departure from isotopic equilibrium with δ p due to seasonality effects skrzypek et al 2015 implemented a formulation by gibson 2014 for adjusting δ a 14 δ a δ p k ε 1 k ε 10 3 where k is an adjustment parameter ranging from 0 6 to 1 obtained from slel2 eq 10 see skrzypek et al 2015 for details please note only imb was calculated for kishi shabakty lake due to the absence of a lake evaporation estimate 3 7 residence time a combination of findings from our previous work on bnnp where lake volume changes and annual lake evaporation yapiyev et al 2019 were estimated and new data gathered on swi composition of the lakes allowed us to calculate lake water residence time for the year 2016 using 15 τ x v l e l y e a r s where v l is lake volume in mm of water layer equivalent e l is lake evaporation in mm of water layer x is annual throughflow index isotope based bennett et al 2008 that equals e l i l in eq 5 but δ l is an arithmetic mean of monthly measurements for the year see table 3 the values of x varied between 0 and 1 so when x 1 it is a closed lake system where e l i l see also section 2 1 in gibson et al 2016 for details the estimation of water residence allows for determining the sensitivity of lakes to drought it can also be further used to evaluate susceptibility of lakes to anthropogenic contamination and nutrient loading table 2 summarizes the key variables used in this work 4 results and discussion 4 1 stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions the stable isotope results δ 18o vs δ 2h in bnnp n 54 formed two distinct clusters fig 2 see also table 3 the lake water samples form a clearly distinct lel with δ 18o varying between 2 1 and 6 1 and δ 2h between 35 4 and 58 5 all

407 mm as recorded at burabay weather station the empirical equations eq 16 and 17 that predict δ 2h and δ 18o in precipitation as a function of temperature dansgaard 1964 leibundgut and maloszewski 2011 explain well the observed range of variation 16 δ 2 h 5 6 t a 100 17 δ 18 o 0 69 t a 13 6 where t a is the mean annual air temperature in ºc using the mean long term annual t a from the shuchinsk weather station 1 4 c yapiyev et al 2017b indicated returns values of 107 8 for δ 2 h and 14 6 for δ 18o these values are in the range of δ values measured in the collected precipitation samples δ 2h 115 44 45 1 and δ 18o 15 9 6 9 table 3 and similar to those interpolated from the global dataset δ 2h 105 8 and δ 18o 14 4 the gnip station at omsk recorded annual average values in precipitation of 103 for δ 2h and 13 9 for δ 18o international atomic energy agency 2015 this comparison suggests that the dataset interpolated for the study site from the global dataset is a good approximation sufficient for calculation of the water inputs 4 3 stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition in groundwater and streams the tight clustering of groundwater n 13 and stream water n 6 results around the gmwl indicates relatively low seasonal and spatial variability in the stable isotope composition inflowing to the lakes in bnnp fig 2 the mean values of δ 2h and δ 18o in groundwater samples are 101 4 2 5 and 13 7 0 4 fig 4 table 3 the stable isotope composition of the stream water δ 2h 97 1 4 1 and δ 18o 13 2 0 5 is very similar to that of groundwater fig 4 and table 3 with a negligible difference between the two major streams of imanai brook and sary bulak river discharging into burabay lake fig 1 both stream water and groundwater slightly deviate towards lel displaying a small evaporative loss most probably from soil as transpiration is not a fractionating flux fig 2 direct and fast interaction between precipitation stream water and groundwater with minimal evaporative losses prior to recharge results in very close δ values of these components and well defined the stable isotope input signal of water discharging to the lakes in the catchments inside of the granite dome of kokshetau ridge burabay and shortandy lakes recently wu et al 2019 published results of a survey of surface water stable isotope across kazakhstan based on a limited number of rivers samples for northern kazakhstan n 15 the reported δ2 h varied between 106 2 and 67 5 mean 91 9 and δ18 o between 10 6 and 13 6 mean 12 wu et al 2019 our data for the stream water are in the range of the reported river samples collected mostly in the same drainage basin esil or ishim river basin 4 4 stable isotope composition of lake waters and lel slopes the stable isotope composition of lake water samples n 30 is characterized by a unique signature for each lake figs 5 and 6 table 4 the grouping of lake samples on the lel confirms the highest degree of evaporation enrichment for ulken shabakty lake i e its points are clustered farthest away from the gmwl the shortest retention time and therefore the lowest evaporative losses are expected for the lakes characterized by the lowest δ values suggesting indirectly a possibility for the highest groundwater inflow in burabay lake in 2016 the slope of lel is primarily driven by relative humidity of air at a given location therefore it also reflects the dynamics of water vapor exchange which may vary depending on the lake size and topography the individual slopes slel can be calculated using different methods table 4 in general lel slopes calculated based on eq 9 slel1 are closer to fitted lel than when these slopes are calculated using eq 10 slel2 slel2 can be interpreted as more realistic evaporation slopes reflecting atmospheric moisture conditions for this part of northern central asia as opposed to slel1 for which the results can be biased as a result of gw inputs into lakes the true long term evaporation slopes for bnnp and the surrounding region are between 5 2 and 5 7 as reflected in the convergence of arithmetic means of slels and fitted slopes table 4 this is also in agreement with recent data reported by wu et al 2019 with slel of 5 66 for lakes in north kazakhstan n 55 the lakes with the highest difference between slel1 and slel2 burabay and shortandy are likely characterized by the largest groundwater input based on surveys conducted from 2012 to 2015 in different regions of kazakhstan wu et al 2019 reported slel of 6 23 for kazakh lakes n 77 however this was without consideration of groundwater input though this value is close to slel for all lake samples from bnnp fig 5 the slope may be too steep to be representative of all kazakhstani territory which is mostly arid the δ 2h and δ 18o show a seasonal variation that varies per lake fig 6 the very modest slopes of the linear trend lines are a reflection of the very low cumulative evaporation over summer and relatively constant evaporation over inflow ratios e l i l for all lakes fig 6 these results and our previous estimates of lake water volumes and surface water extent changes over the past 30 years yapiyev et al 2019 confirm that bnnp lakes are generally in a steady state the close resemblance of isotopic signatures between shortandy and kishi shabakty lakes was unexpected because these lakes have very different hydrological and limnologic characteristics table 1 fig 1 yapiyev et al 2017b we hypothesize that this match can be due to similar long term e l i l values and water residence times kishi shabakty lake catchment surface area is about two times larger than shortandy s but its water volume is almost 40 smaller see table 1 thus kishi shabakty lake has a larger watershed water yield than shortandy lake but higher evaporation losses which are similar to those calculated for ulken shabakty see table 5 mizota et al 2009 reported δ 18o values from a single sampling campaign from several lakes across northern kazakhstan for example the δ 18o value from a saline shallow steppe lake teke 4 4 located around 200 km to north east from bnnp was identical to the mean of δ 18o 4 4 for all bnnp lake water samples see table 3 the other locations lake tengiz 300 km to the south west from bnnp and kushmurun lake 400 km to the west from bnnp had much higher δ 18o values of 0 9 and 1 2 respectively this indicates that most probably bnnp lakes have e l i l regime more similar to the closed lakes in the southern part of siberia than to the steppe lakes located in more arid parts of central asia 4 5 d excess mean d excess for precipitation from the gridded data 9 78 and sample data 11 9 table 3 are close to the global average of 10 brooks et al 2014 moreover d excess values for groundwater 8 2 and streams 8 7 were close to d excess values for weighted precipitation at omsk 8 9 see table 3 and fig 7 a this observation serves as an additional confirmation for the validity of the use of omsk s lmwl for source water determination in our imb calculations in sharp contrast the d excess values for the lakes are very low ranging from 8 6 for kishi shabakty lake to 15 7 for ulken shabakty lake table 3 fig 7b the most negative d excess in lake water of ulken shabakty indicates not only a high degree of evaporation but also the prevalence of old evaporated water as well as low inputs from snowmelt groundwater into its basin 4 6 water and stable isotope mass balance water lake residence time the water balance for three lakes has been calculated using three different methods to verify each method and obtain the most accurate results possible table 5 and fig 8 kishi shabakty lake s level and surface water temperature were not monitored by kazhydromet therefore its water balance is estimated only by the imb method fig 8 see also table 5 footnote additionally watershed inflow yield as a fraction of the overall water balance w y p l w y expressed as a percentage was calculated to characterize the degree of groundwater dependence of the lakes see table 5 bottom row water budget wb see eq 12 and stable isotope mass balance imb methods eq 5 provided very similar e l i l ratios for all the lakes however the water budget estimate by lake level change δll see eq 13 is in good agreement with imb only for ulken shabakty lake based on full watershed area lake area ratio see table 5 footnote for burabay and shortandy there is a significant difference see table 5 and fig 8 in 2016 the water balance of ulken shabakty lake was positive for the first time since 2008 as its water level rose by 27 cm since the end of october 2015 the previous estimates of the long term water balance of this lake showed that its w y is substantially reduced as a result of the isolation of a large part of the watershed to the south east of the lake and due to road construction and burabay settlement developments see fig 1a yapiyev et al 2019 however wb estimate for ulken shabakty for 2016 based on full watershed area r s a 8 15 corresponds much better to the other two water budget methods results imb and δll ulken shabakty occupies the lowest position in the landscape among the three lakes with the order from highest to lowest being shortandy burabay ulken shabakty fig 1b and excess water in the lakes system inside of kokshetau ridge is spilled downgradient mostly by subsurface flow into ulken shabakty which could be considered a terminal lake with limited outflow the outflow of excess water from shortandy and burabay to ulken during wet years rather than losses in the form of evaporation is confirmed by the lack of a trend in increasing δ 18o see fig 6a thus isotopic evaporative signatures match with e l i l by the wb and δll methods for ulken shabakty but there is a discrepancy for burabay and shortandy from 1 november 2013 to 31 october 2016 the ll increased by 27 cm and 13 cm for ulken shabakty and shortandy respectively and decreased by 3 cm during this period for burabay these changes in ll determine e l i l values for the lakes table 5 1 positive water balance or gain in storage for ulken and shortandy and 1 for burabay negative water storage more evaporation than inflow moreover imb almost perfectly fits the independent catchment wb estimates for shortandy and burabay e l i l ratios differences are within 0 01 we propose that this difference between δll and imb e l i l ratios for burabay and shortandy lakes is due to non evaporative loss subsurface flow of water towards ulken shabakty s basin to confirm this hypothesis and calculate the missing volume we subtracted imb s e l i l from ratios based on lake level change δll for shortandy and burabay see table 5 second row from bottom next for each lake this excess water 131 and 456 mm for shortandy and burabay was multiplied by the lake evaporation in mm see table 5 and then multiplied by each lake surface area in m2 in order to obtain the amount of water volume in litres finally we calculated this water volume for burabay and shortandy and divided it by ulken shabakty s lake area to calculate the equivalent of this excess in mm of water layer as received by ulken s shabakty lake the final figure of 359 mm water fits reasonably well with the 270 mm rise in ll of ulken shabakty for the hydrological year the water excess in burabay lake 456 mm is equivalent to a water layer of 253 mm depth over ulken shabakty lake total lake area this likely suggests that the adjacent burabay lake and its watershed contributed considerably to the substantial water level rise of ulken shabakty in 2016 bnnp is dominated by fractured rocks fig 1b resulting in high permeability of the subsurface zone yapiyev et al 2017b provide evidence of very good connectivity between the aquifer and the lake our assumption is that the watershed inflow at bnnp is mediated by groundwater this assumption is also confirmed by stable isotope data and it applies in particular to shortandy lake which has no surface inflow outflows fig 4 in 2016 watershed inflow ranged from 45 5 for shortandy and 50 for ulken shabakty lakes to 74 for burabay lake table 5 our long term 1986 2016 water balance estimates of bnnp lakes yapiyev et al 2019 indicate that the watershed inflow ranges from about 31 and 12 based on reduced watershed area for shortandy and ulken shabakty lakes respectively to 61 for burabay lake data not shown watershed inflow for ulken shabakty based on full watershed area is about 44 and should result in a positive water balance increase in lake water level but this contradicts the observed long term water balance and lake level changes yapiyev et al 2019 under current conditions the water balance of ulken shabakty can be positive only after a succession of very wet years as was also observed in the recent period after 2015 burabay lake has the shortest residence time among the four lakes with its v l e l ratio indicating that around 20 of its volume is lost through evaporation table 6 shortandy and ulken shabakty have the longest water residence times as their volumes are more than five times larger than that of burabay table 1 shortandy is the most balanced among the lakes with the largest volume and lowest evaporation thus yielding the highest v l e l ratio table 6 see also yapiyev et al 2019 though burabay lake water levels have been the most stable in the long term this lake depends heavily on its large watershed inflow and its volume can quickly decline in dry years with extremely low precipitation despite the fact that ulken shabakty is experiencing a long term water level decline yapiyev et al 2017b it remains a relatively large lake as indicated by substantial v l e l ratio and water residence times table 6 water levels for this lake slightly recovered due to a succession of wet water years 2013 2016 but e l continues to rise even in wet years and this is most probably due to the advection of hot dry air during summer from the steppe to the north yapiyev et al 2019 the calculated water residence times in the lakes also suggest that burabay can be highly susceptible to contamination by watershed runoff from its large catchment 4 7 general discussion surface and groundwater watershed divides may not necessarily overlap in complex geological terrains winter et al 2003 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 proposed the fill and spill hypothesis to explain subsurface stormflow run off generation on hillslopes following the filling of macropores on the soil bedrock interface and water transfer between different watersheds they linked this significant subsurface shallow run off generation with a threshold precipitation event when water in saturated areas becomes connected to a trench on a hillslope winter and carr 1980 demonstrated that in north dakota local groundwater flow system discharges water to topographical lows while upper wetlands seem to recharge groundwater shaw et al 2012 examined fill and spill events in canadian prairie wetland complexes and concluded that the watershed contributing area to an outlet and run off generation have a dynamic and intermittent nature such events can cause sudden rises of water level in the terminal basins depending on antecedent watershed conditions the assumption on reduced watershed area is correct for most of the regular years for ulken the wb estimate for ulken shabakty for 2016 based on the entire watershed area r s a e l i l 0 77 corresponds much better to the other two water budget methods results based on imb 0 69 and lake levels 0 71 than the one based on the reduced watershed this can be explained by the occurrence of overflow of water from burabay and shortandy s watersheds to ulken lake it may also suggest that sharp and significant increases in precipitation enhanced hydraulic connectivity in ulken s watershed in 2016 the exact size of the watershed area contributing to run off to ulken in 2016 is not known its determination would require more data such as a high resolution 1 m or higher digital elevation model dem which was not available for this study bnnp experienced three drought years 2008 2010 and 2012 with low p 208 258 and 314 mm year 1 shuchinsk and high pet 838 911 and 904 mm year 1 when lake levels substantially decreased by 0 8 1 5 m yapiyev et al 2019 2017b these years were characterized by high e l ranging from 528 to 718 mm year 1 yapiyev et al 2019 starting from 2013 the precipitation increased and by 2016 was characterized as the second largest total annual precipitation record 523 mm year 1 for the period from 1935 to 2016 shuchinsk weather station see fig 1a this succession of wet years led to filling of shortandy and burabay lake watersheds and spilling into ulken shabakty lake in 2016 almost 50 years ago a similar water level rise was recorded and described by soviet hydrogeologists for ulken shabakty lake called bolshoe chebachie at that time this name is still in use zemlyanitsina 1970 from 1958 1961 ulken shabakty water level rose by approximately 2 m preceded by a ten year 1948 1958 water level decline of more than 2 5 m due to drought conditions uryvaev 1959 zemlyanitsina 1970 note that the highest total annual precipitation to date 607 mm year 1 at bnnp was recorded at shuchinsk weather station in 1960 yapiyev et al 2017b interestingly zhang et al 2017 investigated the trends in extreme precipitation in central asia from 1938 to 2005 the work was based on an analysis of daily station data and they identified abrupt changes increases around 1957 and 1986 overall the year of 2016 had a historical maximum of precipitation 392 mm year 1 across kazakhstan for the observation period of 1936 2016 ministry of energy 2017 the water levels of the lakes in the bnnp have been rising since the last drought in 2012 during our last fieldtrip to bnnp in october 2018 it was observed that ulken shabakty lake had continued to rise its water level had increased by about 32 cm since october 2016 while shortandy lake levels remained unchanged burabay rose by approximately 19 cm kazhydromet 2017 this suggests that the lateral groundwater movement from the elevated shortandy and burabay lakes to ulken shabakty lake can take more than a year this increase of lake water level coincides with a concurrent rise in water levels observed in the great lakes of north america gronewold et al 2016 gronewold and rood 2018 yapiyev et al 2017b lately gronewold and rood 2018 reported that lake ontario that occupies a lowest position and the last in the laurentian great lakes chain rose a record high level in may 2017 gronewold and rood 2018 attribute the latest trend of continuing water level rise in the great lakes to increased precipitation in the region powered by extreme precipitation events linking those to arctic amplification francis and vavrus 2012 they argue that contrary to a common perception that the great lakes water levels are regulated by human water management in their basins the main drivers behind these water storage fluctuations have climatic nature gronewold and rood 2018 undoubtable the great lakes are different from bnnp but there are some similarities with the earth s largest lake system and the other terminal lakes in the north america particularly canadian prairies such as precipitation evaporation rates climate as both are located approximately on the same latitude van der kamp et al 2008 yapiyev et al 2017b though bnnp lakes are much more inland their climate is more continental yapiyev et al 2017b the present and previous yapiyev et al 2019 2017b works on bnnp lakes demonstrated that its hydrological cycle is regulated primarily by climate variability change rather than a direct anthropogenic influences such as water abstraction in its basins 5 conclusions burabay national nature park bnnp is an ecotone between boreal forests with humid air and alpine lakes and arid steppe with a much drier atmosphere bnnp represents a unique hydrometeorological transition zone between wider northern eurasia including boreal siberia and more arid central asia though evaporation loss dominates the water cycle at bnnp leading to a long term decline trend in lake water storage yapiyev et al 2019 2017b the groundwater plays an important role particularly in the forested areas dominated by fractured granites bnnp lake water storage has been replenished recently for the first time in the last 9 years because of unusually high precipitation from 2013 to 2016 the stable isotope study confirmed that the water balance for burabay and shortandy lakes that are found at higher elevation in forested areas is more similar to that of lakes found at higher latitudes e g in south siberia while those for kishi and ulken shabakty lakes at lower elevation and surrounded by steppe are closer to what has been recorded for the steppe lakes of central asia ulken shabakty lake is a terminal basin in this endorheic lake system and a good proxy of overall hydroclimatic conditions at bnnp the recent water level rise in ulken shabakty lake observed in 2016 can be explained by a fill and spill mechanism described before on hillslope scale and for boreal wetlands areas the water stable isotope mass balance and traditional water balance calculations produced very similar results for the annual time scales confirming that the stable isotope methods are a good proxy for laborious and time consuming full scale water budget calculations the stable isotope model could be further improved by better quantification of inputs from snowmelt more precise gnip observations at the study site and direct air moisture stable isotope analyses author

8387,study region burabay national nature park bnnp of north kazakhstan is located between humid boreal forests and an arid steppe of central asia study focus the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope analyses of precipitation stream lake and ground waters were used for water budget calculations of the bnnp endorheic lake system to assess the impact of increasing aridity on lakes in this most continental part of the earth new hydrological insights for the region the stable isotope results confirmed two different types of lakes in bnnp burabay and shortandy lakes are more similar to higher latitude lakes e g south siberia while kishi and ulken shabakty lakes are more comparable to the steppe lakes of central asia the slopes of evaporation lines for this region obtained by regression analysis of lake water samples ranged from 4 57 steppe lakes to 6 21 forest lakes the evaporation over inflow ratios 0 34 burabay 0 69 ulken shabakty and 0 53 shortandy are in good agreement with catchment water budget calculations reflecting different groundwater inputs and water retention times the recent water level rise in the ulken shabakty lake terminal basin was observed for the first time in a decade this increase can be explained by the fill and spill hypothesis and suggest that a single unusually wet year may significantly replenish water resources despite long term increasing aridity of the region keywords endorheic lake evaporation fill and spill water balance stable isotopes groundwater 1 introduction the quantification of hydrological processes governing the water balance of lakes is a challenging task especially in lake systems with heterogeneous geology and complex climate controls in most areas especially in cold semi arid regions there are two critical processes determining lake hydrology 1 open water evaporation and 2 lateral inflow outflow of shallow groundwater and surface water to lakes both evaporation and groundwater flows are the invisible fluxes that are difficult to quantify in addition in arid and semi arid environments open water evaporation is frequently the dominant factor determining the water loss in lakes lake evaporation is usually estimated applying micrometeorological equations such as the penman method driven by local weather data mcmahon et al 2013 the results of the theoretical calculations are often verified by pan evaporation observation or micrometeorological measurements in the field finch and calver 2008 mcjannet et al 2017 mcmahon et al 2013 using eddy covariance equipment mounted downwind of the lakes on flux towers or installed on the lake on buoys vessels or small islands xiao et al 2018 the lateral interactions of groundwater with lakes can be measured directly using groundwater seepage meters ala aho et al 2013 boyle 1994 but are usually investigated with measurements of hydraulic potentials in the watershed subsurface system combined with numerical modeling tools krabbenhoft et al 1994 shaw et al 2013 these traditional methods require constant long term monitoring of vapor fluxes or water levels as well as detailed information on subsurface and aquifer parameters these data are notoriously difficult to obtain in geologically heterogeneous watersheds in particular in remote locations hence these methods are logistically and methodologically challenging time consuming and costly the alternative tracer methods such as the analysis of the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition of water stable water isotopes swi have been widely utilized in lake water balance studies to identify both the evaporative losses and groundwater inputs on all continents gibson et al 2008 however only a few studies using this approach have been conducted to improve the understanding of lake water budgets in central asia therefore swi data are very limited for surface waters groundwaters and precipitation in central asia a region that is subjected to the most continental climate globally sun et al 2017 wang et al 2016 mizota et al 2009 in their study of the lake chany complex in western siberia based on water stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes and stable sulfur isotope compositions concluded that increasing salinity for these lakes is primarily driven by direct lake water evaporation oberhänsli et al 2009 estimated the water budget of the aral sea using swi and confirmed that both evaporative losses and groundwater inflows are significant water balance components for this large lake that has suffered a considerable decline in water levels since the 1960s micklin 2016 ma et al 2018 recently reported swi composition of the large high altitude basin of issyk kul lake inferring intensive surface water evaporation under low relative humidity lakes in arid central asia are particularly vulnerable to climate change and their water levels are in decline pekel et al 2016 yapiyev et al 2017a in this study we present our conclusions on water budget changes in a series of lakes located in the endorheic watersheds of burabay national nature park bnnp in the cold semi arid part of northern central asia kazakhstan and which reflect continental conditions for the region located between boreal siberia and arid central asia previous studies provided a deeper understanding of the drivers of the lake level fluctuations observed in bnnp over the last 100 years yapiyev et al 2019 2017b the main purpose of the current study was to a verify our previous long term observations and improve the bnnp lake water budgets using the stable isotope mass balance imb and b identify hydrological connectivity and lateral interactions of lakes with their watersheds using stable isotopic tracers the overarching aim of this study was to improve our understanding of water cycle in this under researched cold semi arid environment of central asia 2 theory 2 1 stable isotope mass balance the water balance of a well mixed lake under steady state

an approximation a lel is a true evaporation line if there are no other water inputs apart from direct precipitation over the lake the lels are usually derived by fitting the surface water sample data using regression analysis however lel slopes slel can be calculated theoretically based on swi data such as surface water atmospheric composition and precipitation and relative humidity gat 1995 gibson et al 2008 slel is primarily a function of humidity and ambient moisture stable isotope composition there are two common formulations to calculate slel 1 gat 1998 eq 9 and 2 predicted by the

northern kazakhstan 53 n 70 e 300 400 msl see fig 1 a the climate in bnnp is cold semi arid with the snow cover period lasting from mid november to mid april long term 1986 2016 potential evapotranspiration pet is 750 mm year 1 and precipitation p is 330 mm year 1 yapiyev et al 2019 2017b thus the aridity index ai defined as the ratio of mean annual p to mean annual pet is 0 44 climatologically bnnp belongs to the transition zone between cold energy limited northern siberia and the water limited drylands of central asia the bnnp area is dominated by westerly winds that are characteristic for wider northern central asia yapiyev et al 2017b air temperature and precipitation peak in july summer mean 17 c in shuchinsk see fig 1a the summer precipitation constituting around half of the annual total for this region mostly comes from recycled evaporation derived from winter precipitation in continental eurasia located to the west and the north numaguti 1999 bnnp catchments are in the esil tobyl river basin draining into the irtysh river in the ob river basin yapiyev et al 2019 2017b the kokshetau ridge encircling the study area creates conditions for higher precipitation relative to the surrounding flat steppe the ridge acts as a small water tower encouraging orographic rainfall yapiyev et al 2017b bnnp lakes have tectonic origins and differ from the common pan lakes found in the surrounding region see also fig 1b in this study we investigated four lakes burabay shortandy kishi shabakty and ulken shabakty table 1 fig 1 burabay and shortandy are freshwater forest lakes ulken and kishi shabakty have more distinct features of steppe lakes with higher salinity see table 1 yapiyev et al 2017b limnologically bnnp lakes can be classified as cold continuous polymictic uryvaev 1959 the nature of these lakes which are well mixed throughout the year makes them particularly suitable for a stable isotope study brooks et al 2014 3 2 sampling design the water samples for swi analyses 54 in total see table 3 were collected during one hydrologic year from november 2015 to november 2016 lake water samples were collected approximately each month during the ice free period to the capture evaporation signal and groundwater streamwater samples were collected quarterly the water samples were collected in duplicate for each site in 20 ml borosilicate glass scintillation vials with screw caps wheaton science products usa part no 986542 immediately after collection all samples were sealed with parafilm m bemis company usa part no pm 992 to avoid evaporation the samples were stored at room temperature until analysis the lake water samples were collected by grab sampling at the shoreline at fixed locations see table 3 and fig 1a the lake water was sampled at approximately monthly intervals from the start of the open water season end of april to the first days of november 2016 which was about one week before permanent ice cover ice on snow samples collected near lake shortandy fig 1a near aws davis were melted in a sealed container at room temperature rainfall samples were collected at kazakh state hydrometeorological agency kazhydromet weather station near ulken shabakty lake fig 1a sampling point burabay the rainfall samples were collected during abundant precipitation events using a large plastic container and immediately transferred into the vials and sealed groundwater samples were collected from boreholes grdw1 4 fig 1a using a bailer groundwater was sampled during the open water season at approximately three month intervals end of april mid july and end of october 2016 stream samples fig 1a were collected at approximately the same times as groundwater samples following the same sampling procedure used for lake water samples prior to analysis all samples were stored in the dark at room temperature 3 3 stable isotope analyses of water before analysis the samples were filtered into 2 ml screw top vials with ptfe caps thermo scientific chromacol usa part no 2 cv a st cp through a disposable hydrophilic 0 45 μm ptfe syringe filter millex merc millipore ireland part no slcr025ns to remove suspended impurities the samples were analyzed at the global institute for water security mcdonnell watershed hydrology laboratory saskatchewan canada on a liquid water isotope analyzer los gatos research the analyzer uses liquid water off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy off axis icos and has an uncertainty of 1 0 for δ 2h and 0 2 for δ 18o the following reference materials were used to normalize obtained values to vsmow international scale saskatoon snow melt water ssmw δ 2h 200 4 δ 18o 26 1 and enriched δ 2h 3 2 δ 18o 0 3 all samples were tested for volatile organic

antarctic precipitation vsmow slap scales 3 4 hydrometeorological and groundwater data relative humidity and air temperature for 2016 were recorded by kazhydromet kazakh state hydrometeorological agency weather station located on the northern shore of ulken shabakty lake see fig 1a burabay weather station kazhydromet also surveys lake water levels taking measurements daily at 8 00 and 20 00 in lakes burabay shortandy and ulken shabakty using a graduated vertical staff gauge and a geodetic level referencing to a gauge datum mean sea level msl wgs84 a wireless automatic weather station aws vantage pro2 plus model 6163 davis instruments inc with integrated sensor suite was installed in november 2013 on the shore of shortandy lake 52 59 19 87 n 70 13 6 48 e fig 1a the station was mounted

shield relative humidity sensor a solar radiation sensor cup anemometer for wind direction and speed all sensors manufactured by davis instruments inc measurements were recorded at 30 minute intervals and averaged to daily values the groundwater monitoring boreholes fig 1a table 3 were located close to shortandy lake grdw 1 and in burabay lake watershed grdw 2 3 and 4 all boreholes are situated at a higher elevation relative to the lakes table 3 grdw 4 is located in the vicinity of the origin of sary bulak river fig 1a groundwater in this part of bnnp is very fresh 0 07 0 40 g l 1 dominated by bicarbonate and sulphate anions similarly to burabay and shortandy lake water dosumov et al 2014 see fig 1b and table 1 3 5 auxiliary data only a few precipitation samples were available for stable isotope analyses in bnnp see table 3 the monthly swi composition of precipitation necessary for imb modeling was downloaded from waterisotopes org bowen 2018 using bnnp coordinates and mean elevation

stable isotope hydrocalculator firstly we applied a long term lake water balance wb method for the hydrological year of 2015 2016 i e from the ice on of the antecedent year to ice on of the following year where we calculated lake water balance for lakes and their watersheds separately see yapiyev et al 2019 11 s p l w y e l where δs is a change in lake water storage pl precipitation over the lake wy catchment water yield surface and groundwater inflow to the lake including the gain from precipitation falling on the catchment land area or the depth equivalent runoff and el the lake evaporation all wb components are in mm of water per year briefly to obtain annual catchment water yield w y for each lake we subtracted actual evapotranspiration from catchment a e t obtained using budyko curve see section 3 5 2 in yapiyev et al 2019 for details from station precipitation p then multiplied it by ratio catchment lake surface area r s a see table 1 summing p l and w y provides total inflow i l to the lake the outflow is annual ice free e l for the year 2016 as obtained from the our previous work yapiyev et al 2019 the difference between total inflow and outflow for bnnp outflow e l provides an estimate of water storage change for 2016 in this case 12 e l i l e l p l w y secondly we used daily lake levels ll measurements and annual e l see above to estimate all the water inputs to the lake i l and e l i l lake level change δ ll denotes the water storage change as bnnp lakes are endpoints for all water excess in their catchments 13 e l i l e l e l δ l l in order to correctly account for all incoming water fluxes to the lakes we assessed δ ll from the perspective of a hydrological year this way we subtracted ll recorded on 1 november 2015 from ll recorded on 31 october 2016 kazhydromet measurement at 1 cm precision finally we calculated imb using the stable isotope results and the meteorological data using the hydrocalculator skrzypek et al 2015 software based on a modified craig gordon model e l i l was estimated based on the initial pool volume value or inflow defined in hydrocalculator as δ p but here as δ i the final stable isotope composition of water in a lake or reservoir δ l precipitation δ rain relative humidity and air temperature the e l i l ratio and slope of lel for each lake at the beginning sampling 1 and the end of open water season sampling 2 were estimated using measured values and inputs and monthly precipitation δ 18o and δ 2h mean between april and october from waterisotopes org for bnnp defined in hydrocalculator as δ rain mean daily relative humidity decimal fraction and air temperatures c for sampling campaigns 1 and 2 from burabay s weather station for kishi shabakty and ulken shabakty lakes and aws davis for shortandy and burabay lakes were used fig 1a local data for the source water stable isotope composition required for the imb calculations were not available instead omsk lmwl crossing fitted lel was used δ 2 h 108 4 δ 18 o 14 5 the steady state model of hydrocalculator for bnnp lakes was applied with option 3 isotopic composition of ambient air moisture δ a based on δ rain δ p in our case and adjusted versus lel bennett et al 2008 proposed adjusting δ a accounting for its departure from isotopic equilibrium with δ p due to seasonality effects skrzypek et al 2015 implemented a formulation by gibson 2014 for adjusting δ a 14 δ a δ p k ε 1 k ε 10 3 where k is an adjustment parameter ranging from 0 6 to 1 obtained from slel2 eq 10 see skrzypek et al 2015 for details please note only imb was calculated for kishi shabakty lake due to the absence of a lake evaporation estimate 3 7 residence time a combination of findings from our previous work on bnnp where lake volume changes and annual lake evaporation yapiyev et al 2019 were estimated and new data gathered on swi composition of the lakes allowed us to calculate lake water residence time for the year 2016 using 15 τ x v l e l y e a r s where v l is lake volume in mm of water layer equivalent e l is lake evaporation in mm of water layer x is annual throughflow index isotope based bennett et al 2008 that equals e l i l in eq 5 but δ l is an arithmetic mean of monthly measurements for the year see table 3 the values of x varied between 0 and 1 so when x 1 it is a closed lake system where e l i l see also section 2 1 in gibson et al 2016 for details the estimation of water residence allows for determining the sensitivity of lakes to drought it can also be further used to evaluate susceptibility of lakes to anthropogenic contamination and nutrient loading table 2 summarizes the key variables used in this work 4 results and discussion 4 1 stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions the stable isotope results δ 18o vs δ 2h in bnnp n 54 formed two distinct clusters fig 2 see also table 3 the lake water samples form a clearly distinct lel with δ 18o varying between 2 1 and 6 1 and δ 2h between 35 4 and 58 5 all precipitation data fall close to the expected lmwl the estimated lmwls are based on i a limited number 4 of collected samples slope 7 14 ii precipitation interpolated from global dataset bowen et al 2005 slope 7 28 and iii stable isotope precipitation recorded at gnip omsk station slope 7 47 have very similar equations fig 2 the fitted lel the regression line for all sampled lakes crosses lmwls at δ 18o of 15 6 1 1 and δ 2h of 115 6 6 fig 2 slightly below stream water 13 2 0 5 97 1 4 1 and groundwater values 13 7 0 4 101 4 2 5 4 2 stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition in precipitation the results of swi analyses of collected precipitation samples n 5 are close to the expected monthly mean precipitation interpolated from global dataset bowen et al 2005 at bnnp fig 3 as expected the lowest δ values for δ 2h and δ 18o are found for the winter months 160 26 21 9 3 7 are characterized by low precipitation 7 4 14 2 mm month 1 but have relatively high relative humidity 75 81 whereas the highest δ values are found for the summer months from may to september 59 2 7 5 8 0 0 9 when precipitation is higher 14 113 mm month 1 but the relative humidity is on average lower 48 76 fig 3 overall the annual monthly mean δ 2h 105 8 and δ 18o 14 4 reflect cold and arid conditions the total precipitation recorded during the sample collection period december 2015 november 2016 was 407 mm as recorded at burabay weather station the empirical equations eq 16 and 17 that predict δ 2h and δ 18o in precipitation as a function of temperature dansgaard 1964 leibundgut and maloszewski 2011 explain well the observed range of variation 16 δ 2 h 5 6 t a 100 17 δ 18 o 0 69 t a 13 6 where t a is the mean annual air temperature in ºc using the mean long term annual t a from the shuchinsk weather station 1 4 c yapiyev et al 2017b indicated returns values of 107 8 for δ 2 h and 14 6 for δ 18o these values are in the range of δ values measured in the collected precipitation samples δ 2h 115 44 45 1 and δ 18o 15 9 6 9 table 3 and similar to those interpolated from the global dataset δ 2h 105 8 and δ 18o 14 4 the gnip station at omsk recorded annual average values in precipitation of 103 for δ 2h and 13 9 for δ 18o international atomic energy agency 2015 this comparison suggests that the dataset interpolated for the study site from the global dataset is a good approximation sufficient for calculation of the water inputs 4 3 stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition in groundwater and streams the tight clustering of groundwater n 13 and stream water n 6 results around the gmwl indicates relatively low seasonal and spatial variability in the stable isotope composition inflowing to the lakes in bnnp fig 2 the mean values of δ 2h and δ 18o in groundwater samples are 101 4 2 5 and 13 7 0 4 fig 4 table 3 the stable isotope composition of the stream water δ 2h 97 1 4 1 and δ 18o 13 2 0 5 is very similar to that of groundwater fig 4 and table 3 with a negligible difference between the two major streams of imanai brook and sary bulak river discharging into burabay lake fig 1 both stream water and groundwater slightly deviate towards lel displaying a small evaporative loss most probably from soil as transpiration is not a fractionating flux fig 2 direct and fast interaction between precipitation stream water and groundwater with minimal evaporative losses prior to recharge results in very close δ values of these components and well defined the stable isotope input signal of water discharging to the lakes in the catchments inside of the granite dome of kokshetau ridge burabay and shortandy lakes recently wu et al 2019 published results of a survey of surface water stable isotope across kazakhstan based on a limited number of rivers samples for northern kazakhstan n 15 the reported δ2 h varied between 106 2 and 67 5 mean 91 9 and δ18 o between 10 6 and 13 6 mean 12 wu et al 2019 our data for the stream water are in the range of the reported river samples collected mostly in the same drainage basin esil or ishim river basin 4 4 stable isotope composition of lake waters and lel slopes the stable isotope composition of lake water samples n 30 is characterized by a unique signature for each lake figs 5 and 6 table 4 the grouping of lake samples on the lel confirms the highest degree of evaporation enrichment for ulken shabakty lake i e its points are clustered farthest away from the gmwl the shortest retention time and therefore the lowest evaporative losses are expected for the lakes characterized by the lowest δ values suggesting indirectly a possibility for the highest groundwater inflow in burabay lake in 2016 the slope of lel is primarily driven by relative humidity of air at a given location therefore it also reflects the dynamics of water vapor exchange which may vary depending on the lake size and topography the individual slopes slel can be calculated using different methods table 4 in general lel slopes calculated based on eq 9 slel1 are closer to fitted lel than when these slopes are calculated using eq 10 slel2 slel2 can be interpreted as more realistic evaporation slopes reflecting atmospheric moisture conditions for this part of northern central asia as opposed to slel1 for which the results can be biased as a result of gw inputs into lakes the true long term evaporation slopes for bnnp and the surrounding region are between 5 2 and 5 7 as reflected in the convergence of arithmetic means of slels and fitted slopes table 4 this is also in agreement with recent data reported by wu et al 2019 with slel of 5 66 for lakes in north kazakhstan n 55 the lakes with the highest difference between slel1 and slel2 burabay and shortandy are likely characterized by the largest groundwater input based on surveys conducted from 2012 to 2015 in different regions of kazakhstan wu et al 2019 reported slel of 6 23 for kazakh lakes n 77 however this was without consideration of groundwater input though this value is close to slel for all lake samples from bnnp fig 5 the slope may be too steep to be representative of all kazakhstani territory which is mostly arid the δ 2h and δ 18o show a seasonal variation that varies per lake fig 6 the very modest slopes of the linear trend lines are a reflection of the very low cumulative evaporation over summer and relatively constant evaporation over inflow ratios e l i l for all lakes fig 6 these results and our previous estimates of lake water volumes and surface water extent changes over the past 30 years yapiyev et al 2019 confirm that bnnp lakes are generally in a steady state the close resemblance of isotopic signatures between shortandy and kishi shabakty lakes was unexpected because these lakes have very different hydrological and limnologic characteristics table 1 fig 1 yapiyev et al 2017b we hypothesize that this match can be due to similar long term e l i l values and water residence times kishi shabakty lake catchment surface area is about two times larger than shortandy s but its water volume is almost 40 smaller see table 1 thus kishi shabakty lake has a larger watershed water yield than shortandy lake but higher evaporation losses which are similar to those calculated for ulken shabakty see table 5 mizota et al 2009 reported δ 18o values from a single sampling campaign from several lakes across northern kazakhstan for example the δ 18o value from a saline shallow steppe lake teke 4 4 located around 200 km to north east from bnnp was identical to the mean of δ 18o 4 4 for all bnnp lake water samples see table 3 the other locations lake tengiz 300 km to the south west from bnnp and kushmurun lake 400 km to the west from bnnp had much higher δ 18o values of 0 9 and 1 2 respectively this indicates that most probably bnnp lakes have e l i l regime more similar to the closed lakes in the southern part of siberia than to the steppe lakes located in more arid parts of central asia 4 5 d excess mean d excess for precipitation from the gridded data 9 78 and sample data 11 9 table 3 are close to the global average of 10 brooks et al 2014 moreover d excess values for groundwater 8 2 and streams 8 7 were close to d excess values for weighted precipitation at omsk 8 9 see table 3 and fig 7 a this observation serves as an additional confirmation for the validity of the use of omsk s lmwl for source water determination in our imb calculations in sharp contrast the d excess values for the lakes are very low ranging from 8 6 for kishi shabakty lake to 15 7 for ulken shabakty lake table 3 fig 7b the most negative d excess in lake water of ulken shabakty indicates not only a high degree of evaporation but also the prevalence of old evaporated water as well as low inputs from snowmelt groundwater into its basin 4 6 water and stable isotope mass balance water lake residence time the water balance for three lakes has been calculated using three different methods to verify each method and obtain the most accurate results possible table 5 and fig 8 kishi shabakty lake s level and surface water temperature were not monitored by kazhydromet therefore its water balance is estimated only by the imb method fig 8 see also table 5 footnote additionally watershed inflow yield as a fraction of the overall water balance w y p l w y expressed as a percentage was calculated to characterize the degree of groundwater dependence of the lakes see table 5 bottom row water budget wb see eq 12 and stable isotope mass balance imb methods eq 5 provided very similar e l i l ratios for all the lakes however the water budget estimate by lake level change δll see eq 13 is in good agreement with imb only for ulken shabakty lake based on full watershed area lake area ratio see table 5 footnote for burabay and shortandy there is a significant difference see table 5 and fig 8 in 2016 the water balance of ulken shabakty lake was positive for the first time since 2008 as its water level rose by 27 cm since the end of october 2015 the previous estimates of the long term water balance of this lake showed that its w y is substantially reduced as a result of the isolation of a large part of the watershed to the south east of the lake and due to road construction and burabay settlement developments see fig 1a yapiyev et al 2019 however wb estimate for ulken shabakty for 2016 based on full watershed area r s a 8 15 corresponds much better to the other two water budget methods results imb and δll ulken shabakty occupies the lowest position in the landscape among the three lakes with the order from highest to lowest being shortandy burabay ulken shabakty fig 1b and excess water in the lakes system inside of kokshetau ridge is spilled downgradient mostly by subsurface flow into ulken shabakty which could be considered a terminal lake with limited outflow the outflow of excess water from shortandy and burabay to ulken during wet years rather than losses in the form of evaporation is confirmed by the lack of a trend in increasing δ 18o see fig 6a thus isotopic evaporative signatures match with e l i l by the wb and δll methods for ulken shabakty but there is a discrepancy for burabay and shortandy from 1 november 2013 to 31 october 2016 the ll increased by 27 cm and 13 cm for ulken shabakty and shortandy respectively and decreased by 3 cm during this period for burabay these changes in ll determine e l i l values for the lakes table 5 1 positive water balance or gain in storage for ulken and shortandy and 1 for burabay negative water storage more evaporation than inflow moreover imb almost perfectly fits the independent catchment wb estimates for shortandy and burabay e l i l ratios differences are within 0 01 we propose that this difference between δll and imb e l i l ratios for burabay and shortandy lakes is due to non evaporative loss subsurface flow of water towards ulken shabakty s basin to confirm this hypothesis and calculate the missing volume we subtracted imb s e l i l from ratios based on lake level change δll for shortandy and burabay see table 5 second row from bottom next for each lake this excess water 131 and 456 mm for shortandy and burabay was multiplied by the lake evaporation in mm see table 5 and then multiplied by each lake surface area in m2 in order to obtain the amount of water volume in litres finally we calculated this water volume for burabay and shortandy and divided it by ulken shabakty s lake area to calculate the equivalent of this excess in mm of water layer as received by ulken s shabakty lake the final figure of 359 mm water fits reasonably well with the 270 mm rise in ll of ulken shabakty for the hydrological year the water excess in burabay lake 456 mm is equivalent to a water layer of 253 mm depth over ulken shabakty lake total lake area this likely suggests that the adjacent burabay lake and its watershed contributed considerably to the substantial water level rise of ulken shabakty in 2016 bnnp is dominated by fractured rocks fig 1b resulting in high permeability of the subsurface zone yapiyev et al 2017b provide evidence of very good connectivity between the aquifer and the lake our assumption is that the watershed inflow at bnnp is mediated by groundwater this assumption is also confirmed by stable isotope data and it applies in particular to shortandy lake which has no surface inflow outflows fig 4 in 2016 watershed inflow ranged from 45 5 for shortandy and 50 for ulken shabakty lakes to 74 for burabay lake table 5 our long term 1986 2016 water balance estimates of bnnp lakes yapiyev et al 2019 indicate that the watershed inflow ranges from about 31 and 12 based on reduced watershed area for shortandy and ulken shabakty lakes respectively to 61 for burabay lake data not shown watershed inflow for ulken shabakty based on full watershed area is about 44 and should result in a positive water balance increase in lake water level but this contradicts the observed long term water balance and lake level changes yapiyev et al 2019 under current conditions the water balance of ulken shabakty can be positive only after a succession of very wet years as was also observed in the recent period after 2015 burabay lake has the shortest residence time among the four lakes with its v l e l ratio indicating that around 20 of its volume is lost through evaporation table 6 shortandy and ulken shabakty have the longest water residence times as their volumes are more than five times larger than that of burabay table 1 shortandy is the most balanced among the lakes with the largest volume and lowest evaporation thus yielding the highest v l e l ratio table 6 see also yapiyev et al 2019 though burabay lake water levels have been the most stable in the long term this lake depends heavily on its large watershed inflow and its volume can quickly decline in dry years with extremely low precipitation despite the fact that ulken shabakty is experiencing a long term water level decline yapiyev et al 2017b it remains a relatively large lake as indicated by substantial v l e l ratio and water residence times table 6 water levels for this lake slightly recovered due to a succession of wet water years 2013 2016 but e l continues to rise even in wet years and this is most probably due to the advection of hot dry air during summer from the steppe to the north yapiyev et al 2019 the calculated water residence times in the lakes also suggest that burabay can be highly susceptible to contamination by watershed runoff from its large catchment 4 7 general discussion surface and groundwater watershed divides may not necessarily overlap in complex geological terrains winter et al 2003 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 proposed the fill and spill hypothesis to explain subsurface stormflow run off generation on hillslopes following the filling of macropores on the soil bedrock interface and water transfer between different watersheds they linked this significant subsurface shallow run off generation with a threshold precipitation event when water in saturated areas becomes connected to a trench on a hillslope winter and carr 1980 demonstrated that in north dakota local groundwater flow system discharges water to topographical lows while upper wetlands seem to recharge groundwater shaw et al 2012 examined fill and spill events in canadian prairie wetland complexes and concluded that the watershed contributing area to an outlet and run off generation have a dynamic and intermittent nature such events can cause sudden rises of water level in the terminal basins depending on antecedent watershed conditions the assumption on reduced watershed area is correct for most of the regular years for ulken the wb estimate for ulken shabakty for 2016 based on the entire watershed area r s a e l i l 0 77 corresponds much better to the other two water budget methods results based on imb 0 69 and lake levels 0 71 than the one based on the reduced watershed this can be explained by the occurrence of overflow of water from burabay and shortandy s watersheds to ulken lake it may also suggest that sharp and significant increases in precipitation enhanced hydraulic connectivity in ulken s watershed in 2016 the exact size of the watershed area contributing to run off to ulken in 2016 is not known its determination would require more data such as a high resolution 1 m or higher digital elevation model dem which was not available for this study bnnp experienced three drought years 2008 2010 and 2012 with low p 208 258 and 314 mm year 1 shuchinsk and high pet 838 911 and 904 mm year 1 when lake levels substantially decreased by 0 8 1 5 m yapiyev et al 2019 2017b these years were characterized by high e l ranging from 528 to 718 mm year 1 yapiyev et al 2019 starting from 2013 the precipitation increased and by 2016 was characterized as the second largest total annual precipitation record 523 mm year 1 for the period from 1935 to 2016 shuchinsk weather station see fig 1a this succession of wet years led to filling of shortandy and burabay lake watersheds and spilling into ulken shabakty lake in 2016 almost 50 years ago a similar water level rise was recorded and described by soviet hydrogeologists for ulken shabakty lake called bolshoe chebachie at that time this name is still in use zemlyanitsina 1970 from 1958 1961 ulken shabakty water level rose by approximately 2 m preceded by a ten year 1948 1958 water level decline of more than 2 5 m due to drought conditions uryvaev 1959 zemlyanitsina 1970 note that the highest total annual precipitation to date 607 mm year 1 at bnnp was recorded at shuchinsk weather station in 1960 yapiyev et al 2017b interestingly zhang et al 2017 investigated the trends in extreme precipitation in central asia from 1938 to 2005 the work was based on an analysis of daily station data and they identified abrupt changes increases around 1957 and 1986 overall the year of 2016 had a historical maximum of precipitation 392 mm year 1 across kazakhstan for the observation period of 1936 2016 ministry of energy 2017 the water levels of the lakes in the bnnp have been rising since the last drought in 2012 during our last fieldtrip to bnnp in october 2018 it was observed that ulken shabakty lake had continued to rise its water level had increased by about 32 cm since october 2016 while shortandy lake levels remained unchanged burabay rose by approximately 19 cm kazhydromet 2017 this suggests that the lateral groundwater movement from the elevated shortandy and burabay lakes to ulken shabakty lake can take more than a year this increase of lake water level coincides with a concurrent rise in water levels observed in the great lakes of north america gronewold et al 2016 gronewold and rood 2018 yapiyev et al 2017b lately gronewold and rood 2018 reported that lake ontario that occupies a lowest position and the last in the laurentian great lakes chain rose a record high level in may 2017 gronewold and rood 2018 attribute the latest trend of continuing water level rise in the great lakes to increased precipitation in the region powered by extreme precipitation events linking those to arctic amplification francis and vavrus 2012 they argue that contrary to a common perception that the great lakes water levels are regulated by human water management in their basins the main drivers behind these water storage fluctuations have climatic nature gronewold and rood 2018 undoubtable the great lakes are different from bnnp but there are some similarities with the earth s largest lake system and the other terminal lakes in the north america particularly canadian prairies such as precipitation evaporation rates climate as both are located approximately on the same latitude van der kamp et al 2008 yapiyev et al 2017b though bnnp lakes are much more inland their climate is more continental yapiyev et al 2017b the present and previous yapiyev et al 2019 2017b works on bnnp lakes demonstrated that its hydrological cycle is regulated primarily by climate variability change rather than a direct anthropogenic influences such as water abstraction in its basins 5 conclusions burabay national nature park bnnp is an ecotone between boreal forests with humid air and alpine lakes and arid steppe with a much drier atmosphere bnnp represents a unique hydrometeorological transition zone between wider northern eurasia including boreal siberia and more arid central asia though evaporation loss dominates the water cycle at bnnp leading to a long term decline trend in lake water storage yapiyev et al 2019 2017b the groundwater plays an important role particularly in the forested areas dominated by fractured granites bnnp lake water storage has been replenished recently for the first time in the last 9 years because of unusually high precipitation from 2013 to 2016 the stable isotope study confirmed that the water balance for burabay and shortandy lakes that are found at higher elevation in forested areas is more similar to that of lakes found at higher latitudes e g in south siberia while those for kishi and ulken shabakty lakes at lower elevation and surrounded by steppe are closer to what has been recorded for the steppe lakes of central asia ulken shabakty lake is a terminal basin in this endorheic lake system and a good proxy of overall hydroclimatic conditions at bnnp the recent water level rise in ulken shabakty lake observed in 2016 can be explained by a fill and spill mechanism described before on hillslope scale and for boreal wetlands areas the water stable isotope mass balance and traditional water balance calculations produced very similar results for the annual time scales confirming that the stable isotope methods are a good proxy for laborious and time consuming full scale water budget calculations the stable isotope model could be further improved by better quantification of inputs from snowmelt more precise gnip observations at the study site and direct air moisture stable isotope analyses author

the important links in a series of water cycles such as precipitation evaporation and runoff affect the distribution of water resources gao et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 qingbai and yongzhi 2004 understanding the causes of changes in runoff caused by environmental changes is of great significance for understanding the mechanism of hydrological changes garg et al 2019 believed that human activities could lead to land use change but this assumption ignores that temperature change can also change land use climate change and human activities have led to changes in land use and secondary fluctuations in precipitation and runoff wang et al 2018b zhou et al 2015 huang et al 2016 continuously enhanced human activities and a large amount of construction for water conservation projects primarily impact the hydrological process by affecting evaporation infiltration runoff generation and confluence which cause significant changes in water resource quantities in the qtp deng and zhang

theoretical significance to the protection of water resources in the qtp the quantitative decomposition of the impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff changes is important for regional water resources planning and management al jawad et al 2019 wang et al 2015 2018a the main methods for quantifying the impact of climate change and human activities on watershed water

activities to runoff in 7 typical river basins in china using the vic model and long term runoff observation data recently most hydrological variation studies have focused on the mutation diagnosis of a single factor hydrological series wu et al 2017 chen et al 2019 wang et al 2018b chang et al 2015 zheng et al 2019 under a changing environment the correlation between precipitation and runoff changes continuously therefore scientific problems that urgently need to be solved include identifying the inherent variation law for the relationship between precipitation and runoff as well as the variation in their correlations the most recent and frequently used correlation analysis methods in the hydrological field are the pearson correlation coefficient spearman correlation coefficient and the kendall correlation coefficient lópez vicente and navas 2012 wang et al 2016a however all of these methods ignore the changes in the nonlinear relationship between variables unlike the archimedean

development yang et al 2018 gao et al 2018 2 methods 2 1 study area the nagqu river basin nrb originated from the northeast tibet plateau fig 1 which has an area of 74 043 km2 a total length of 818 km a river section drop of 2 46 and an average elevation of 4761 m weng et al 2020 the nrb is a semi humid climate zone with sub frozen plateau zone and has an average 180 day glacial period the average value of the monitoring data in the statistical basin and surrounding meteorological stations shows that the average daily temperature from 1970 to 2017 is 0 1 c the average maximum daily temperature is 30 6 c and the minimum daily temperature is 41 2 c deng and zhang 2018 the average annual precipitation of the basin is about 550 mm of which 80 of the total annual precipitation is concentrated in june to september and the precipitation in the dry season is less than 20 of the total annual precipitation you et al 2007 under the influence of alpine climate there are certain permanent glacial snow covered areas in the basin and the snow cover is widely distributed which is an area sensitive to climate change and human activities 2 2 recognition of the copula joint mutation point the copula function can be used to connect any d dimensional joint cumulative distribution shiau 2006 karra and mili 2019 mcneil and nešlehová 2009 the establishment of the copula simultaneous distribution can be divided into two steps 1 fitting the distribution of all the hydrologic variables and determining the optimal type for all marginal distributions 2 based on the distribution type for all marginal functions compute the parameter values θ for the functions in the symmetric archimedean copula function and determine the copula function with optimal fitting generally the definition of the d dimensional symmetric archimedean copula function is as follows zhang and singh 2007 1 c u 1 u 2 u d φ 1 φ u 1 φ u 2 φ u d where u j f x j j 1 2 d φ is the generation function of the archimedean copula and φ 1 is the inverse function of φ as for the archimedean copula the sample size is n the observation data are x i y i i ε 1 n and its marginal distributions are f x and g y according to density functions f x and g y respectively the joint distribution of x y is written as 2 h x y c f x g y thus its density function is h x y f x g y c 12 f x g y and c is the archimedean copula function 3 c 12 u v u v c u v the maximum likelihood estimation of parameters in the archimedean copula function in the kth year k ε 1 n is 4 λ k a r g max λεr i 1 k ln c 12 λ f x i g y i suppose there is a variation point in the observation data the original hypothesis h 0 and the alternative hypothesis h 1 can be expressed as h 0 λ 1 λ 2 λ n h 1 λ 1 λ k λ k 1 λ n if the original hypothesis is rejected k will be the variation point time for the condition k k the following log likelihood ratio statistics of the copula by means of a maximum likelihood estimation can be established dias

data parameters in this study a statistic z n is introduced this study adopts a 95 confidence level for z n when the maximum value of z n computed in eq 5 is greater than 9 dias 2004 meanwhile binary segmentation is used to check whether there are several variation points if k is unknown when the statistics z n max 1 k n 2 l n λ k are below the 95 confidence level and greater than χ 2 1 the original hypothesis is refused that is the variation point exists according to the likelihood ratio test an asymptotic distribution of statistics z n has a χ 2 distribution on the freedom constraint numbers when there are several variation points in the sequence binary segmentation was used until there are no variation points in every sub sequence leydold and hörmann 2011 2 3 diagnostic application of relation variations the runoff change in watershed reflects the joint influence of climate change and human activities currently there are many studies that perform quantitative analyses on the influence of climate change and human activities on runoff changes wu et al 2017 chen et al 2019 he et al 2013 and the separation and analysis methods of the effects of the two on runoff are proposed 6 δ r c r h n r n 7 δ r h r h r r h n 8 δ δ r c δ r h 9 μ c δ r c δ 100 10 μ h δ r h δ 100 where δ r h stands for the influential quantity of human activities affecting runoff δ r c represents the influential quantity of climate change affecting runoff r h n constitutes the runoff quantity actually measured during the human activity influence period r n is the runoff quantity during the natural period r h r stands for the natural runoff quantity during the human activity influence period which is computed by the hydrological model δ stands for the total quantity of runoff change μ h and μ c constitute the percentage of influences on human activity and climate change respectively towards the runoff the above separation method has been widely used zhang et al 2019 zheng et al 2019 wu et al 2017 chen et al 2019 but it can further subdivide the impact of land use change on runoff into climate change and human activities 11 δ r l h r h h 2 r h h 1 12 δ r l c r h c 2 r h c 1 13 μ l c μ c δ r l c δ r c δ r l c 100 14 μ l h μ h δ r l h δ r h δ r l h 100 where δ r l h and δ r l c stand for land use changes caused by human activities and climate change respectively r h h 1 r h h 2 stand for the runoff during the human activity period 1 and 2 influenced by cultivated and urban land change respectively r h c 1 r h c 2 stand for the runoff during period 1 and 2 influenced by other land use changes e g forest land grassland waters unutilized land respectively μ l c and μ l h stand for land use influenced by climate change and human activities the calculation flow chart is shown below fig 2 3 results 3 1 the marginal distribution of the precipitation and the runoff when there is a correlation between precipitation and runoff the copula function can be used to analyze the correlation the precipitation and runoff processes are subject to their own marginal distribution function song and singh 2010b this study applied the gumbel distribution the lognormal distribution and the pearson iii distribution to make comparisons and determined the distribution with the best fit to the data sequence dias 2004 cousineau et al 2004 song and singh 2010a performing a goodness of fit test on the marginal distribution required adopting the information minimization rule of the root mean square error rmse and akaike information criterion aic pan 2001 karra and mili 2019 dias 2004 therefore the marginal distributions of the runoff and the precipitation in the nrb were the gumbel distribution and the pearson iii distribution respectively table 1 in accordance with the correlation subject range of different copula functions this paper chose the clayton and gumbel hougaard copula function to construct a joint distribution function and determined that the copula function yielded a better fit table 2 reddy and ganguli 2012 e shemyakin and youn 2006 song and singh 2010b by adopting the information minimization rules for rmse and aic it can be seen that the gumbel hougaard copula function has a stronger fitting precision than the clayton copula function therefore the gumbel hougaard copula function is chosen as the connectivity function for this research 3 2 variation point detection the precipitation runoff variation testing method based on the archimedean copula function is applied to analyze the copula structure and to diagnose variation in the precipitation runoff relationship the z n of dasa station and jiayuqiao station reached the maximum in 1983 and 1996 respectively fig 3 using the binary segmentation method to check the segmentation year leydold and hörmann 2011 dias 2004 there is no mutation point the results indicate that there is remarkable variation in the precipitation runoff relationship structure in the nrb 3 3 model calibration and verification based on the water and energy transfer process for a large basin wep l distributed hydrological model jia et al 2006 2001 this study constructs a distributed hydrological model in the alpine regions and determines and verifies the monthly runoff of the dasa and jiayuqiao stations the input data includes daily precipitation temperature sunshine humidity wind speed of 12 meteorological stations from 1960 to 2017 land use data of 1980 1990 2000 2005 and 2015 as well as soil type and thickness jia et al 2001 2006 liu et al 2018 table 3 reflects the simulation effects of the wep l model the average values of r2 in the two hydrological stations during the calibration and verification period are 0 83 and 0 75 respectively the average values of nash are 0 75 and 0 71 respectively the average values of relative error re are 0 04 and 0 03 respectively wang et al 2009 yang et al 2019 it can be seen that the model is suitable for the nrb overall the ideal effect has been achieved and can be used for further calculation of the model 3 4 contributions of land use climate change and human activities to runoff change in different time periods the separation and analysis of river basin climate change other human activities and land use impact on runoff were carried out eq 6 14 the monthly average runoff represents the runoff in each stage and the contribution rate of different influencing factors is separated table 4 in the nrb the runoff of the other human activities increased by 0 91 mm compared with the natural period climate change leads to an increase in runoff in the basin the contribution of the runoff caused by this change accounts for 82 7 of the total change in the runoff among them the contribution rate of land use is 39 3 human activities caused the runoff to decrease and its contribution rate to runoff change reached 17 3 which was lower than the change induced by climate change in the jiayuqiao river basin the runoff depth of the other human activities increased by 18 91 mm and climate factors affected the maximum runoff change reaching 71 5 in general climate change human activities and land use change in two sub basins vary in terms of runoff among them the degree of change in runoff caused by land use change differs according to the land cover of the basin climate change is mainly related to the geographical location of the basin other human activities are mainly related to the distribution of human settlements zheng et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 chang et al 2015 voigt and shaw 2015 4 discussion the formation and change in watershed runoff are related not only to changes in precipitation but also to changes in underlying surface conditions caused by human activities as well as the direct influence of human activities that is to say natural factors and human activities cause variations in the precipitation runoff relationship in the basin the nrb is a typical natural plateau river and it has been shown that the main cause for variation in the relationship between precipitation and runoff is the impact of land use li et al 2018 we analyzed the influence of the precipitation runoff relationship from the following three aspects climate change human activities and land use 1 the rise or fall of temperature over a longer period of time the increase or decrease of precipitation and evaporation the increase or decrease of snow and ice coverage etc will all affect the water cycle replacement capacity of the asia water tower and the carrying capacity of water resources gao et al 2018 the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources and the amount of water resources have a major impact there is also mutual feedback between these components and the plateau water resources show an overall change which is also the effect of these large and small feedback effects according to the annual temperature and geothermal evolution process in the upper reaches of the nujiang river and various meteorological stations the overall average temperature of the basin is significantly increasing the average annual temperature is 0 415 c 10a which is significantly higher than the average temperature rate in china 0 25 c 10a ren and tang 2017 fig 4 the annual average air temperature and surface temperature of various meteorological stations showed an increasing trend the increasing annual average temperature of meteorological stations met the significance test the increase in temperature also led to an increase in the rate of melting of glaciers with a reduction of glaciers between the twice glacier inventory of 1 155 billion m3 year yan et al 2017 the maximum frozen soil depth in the dasa basin is reduced by about 1 1 cm a while the maximum frozen soil depth in the jiayuqiao basin is relatively stable decreasing at a rate of 0 1 cm a yan et al 2017 liu et al 2018 under the influence of climate change glacial and permanent frozen soil meltwater will flow into the river resulting in increased runoff on the other hand according to the evolution process of annual precipitation in the upper reaches of the nujiang river and various meteorological stations the annual precipitation of all meteorological stations shows an increasing trend however the annual precipitation increase trend of the jiayuqiao river basin meteorological station does not satisfy the significance test and the overall increase in precipitation in the basin is not significant 2 the nrb covers two cities and nine counties according to the sixth national census the total population in the upper reaches is about 450 000 the annual water consumption in the basin is about 73 million m3 of which agricultural water consumption is about 52 million m3 chalong and biru power station are built in the nrb for storage or power generation however in general the water conservancy project in the upper reaches of the nujiang river has less impact on the runoff process in the basin 3 according to the distribution of land use in the upper reaches of the nujiang river in 1980 and 2015 assessed with an accuracy of 1000 m provided by the resource and environmental science data center of the chinese academy of sciences the land use in the basin is dominated by grassland followed by unused land mainly including permafrost permanent snow cover and bare land etc mainly distributed in the mountainous areas in the lower reaches of the basin the proportion of cultivated land and residential land is small indicating that the basin is not directly affected by human activities comparing the changes in the land use type of the two phases tables 5a and 5b the overall land use type of the basin varies greatly the overall performance is that due to the impact of global warming the vertical distribution of vegetation is shifted upwards and the area of grassland converted to forest land is 6542 2 km2 therefore vegetation interception and storage in the depression increase additionally the snow cover area of waters and glaciers increase slightly 5 conclusions in this study we investigated the precipitation and runoff distributions of the nrb in the qtp then we attributed the runoff changes to climate change and human activities we diagnosed variations in the relationship between precipitation and runoff in the nrb over a period of 57 years climate change and human activities were analyzed and the land use contribution rate was separated from them we verified the results with related references based on the correlation between precipitation runoff and human activities the result was reasonable this method can be applied to other basins or be used to diagnose variations in relationships between other meteorological and hydrological elements

functions compute the parameter values θ for the functions in the symmetric archimedean copula function and determine the copula function with optimal fitting generally the definition of the d dimensional symmetric archimedean copula function is as follows zhang and singh 2007 1 c u 1 u 2 u d φ 1 φ u 1 φ u 2 φ u d where u j f x j j 1 2 d φ is the generation function of the archimedean copula and φ 1 is the inverse function of φ as for the archimedean copula the sample size is n the observation data are x i y i i ε 1 n and its marginal distributions are f x and g y according to density functions f x and g y respectively the joint distribution of x y is written as 2 h x y c f x g y thus its density function is h x y f x g y c 12 f x g y and c is the archimedean copula

there is a variation point in the observation data the original hypothesis h 0 and the alternative hypothesis h 1 can be expressed as h 0 λ 1 λ 2 λ n h 1 λ 1 λ k λ k 1 λ n if the original hypothesis is rejected k will be the variation point time for the condition k k the following log likelihood ratio statistics of the copula by means of a maximum likelihood estimation can be established dias

data parameters in this study a statistic z n is introduced this study adopts a 95 confidence level for z n when the maximum value of z n computed in eq 5 is greater than 9 dias 2004 meanwhile binary segmentation is used to check whether there are several variation points if k is unknown when the statistics z n max 1 k n 2 l n λ k are below the 95 confidence level and greater than χ 2 1 the original hypothesis is refused that is the variation point exists according to the likelihood ratio test an asymptotic distribution of statistics z n has a χ 2 distribution on the freedom constraint numbers when there are several variation points in the sequence binary segmentation was used until there are no variation points in every sub sequence leydold and hörmann 2011 2 3 diagnostic application of relation variations the runoff change in watershed reflects the joint influence of climate change and human activities currently there are many studies that perform quantitative analyses on the influence of climate change and human activities on runoff changes wu et al 2017 chen et al 2019 he et al 2013 and the separation and analysis methods of the effects of the two on runoff are proposed 6 δ r c r h n r n 7 δ r h r h r r h n 8 δ δ r c δ r h 9 μ c δ r c δ 100 10 μ h δ r h δ 100 where δ r h stands for the influential quantity of human activities affecting runoff δ r c represents the influential quantity of climate change affecting runoff r h n constitutes the runoff quantity actually measured during the human activity influence period r n is the runoff quantity during the natural period r h r stands for the natural runoff quantity during the human activity influence period which is computed by the hydrological model δ stands for the total quantity of runoff change μ h and μ c constitute the percentage of influences on human activity and climate change respectively towards the runoff the above separation method has been widely used zhang et al 2019 zheng et al 2019 wu et al 2017 chen et al 2019 but it can further subdivide the impact of land use change on runoff into climate change and human activities 11 δ r l h r h h 2 r h h 1 12 δ r l c r h c 2 r h

influenced by other land use changes e g forest land grassland waters unutilized land respectively μ l c and μ l h stand for land use influenced by climate change and human activities the calculation flow chart is shown below fig 2 3 results 3 1 the marginal distribution of the precipitation and the runoff when there is a correlation between precipitation and runoff the copula function can be used to analyze the correlation the precipitation and runoff processes are subject to their own marginal distribution function song and singh 2010b this study applied the gumbel distribution the lognormal distribution and the pearson iii distribution to make comparisons and determined the distribution with the best fit to the data sequence dias 2004 cousineau et al 2004 song and singh 2010a performing a goodness of fit test on the marginal distribution required adopting the information minimization rule of the root mean square error rmse and akaike information criterion aic pan 2001 karra and mili 2019 dias 2004 therefore the marginal distributions of the runoff and the precipitation in the nrb were the gumbel distribution and the pearson iii distribution respectively table 1 in accordance with the correlation subject range of different copula functions this paper chose the clayton and gumbel hougaard copula function to construct a joint distribution function and determined that the copula function yielded a better fit table 2 reddy and ganguli 2012 e shemyakin and youn 2006 song and singh 2010b by adopting the information minimization rules for rmse and aic it can be seen that the gumbel hougaard copula function has a stronger fitting precision than the clayton copula function therefore the gumbel hougaard copula function is chosen as the connectivity function for this research 3 2 variation point detection the precipitation runoff variation testing method based on the archimedean copula function is applied to analyze the copula structure and to diagnose variation in the precipitation runoff relationship the z n of dasa station and jiayuqiao station reached the maximum in 1983 and 1996 respectively fig 3 using the binary segmentation method to check the segmentation year leydold and hörmann 2011 dias 2004 there is no mutation point the results indicate that there is remarkable variation in the precipitation runoff relationship structure in the nrb 3 3 model calibration and verification based on the water and energy transfer process for a large basin wep l distributed hydrological model jia et al 2006 2001 this study constructs a distributed hydrological model in the alpine regions and determines and verifies the monthly runoff of the dasa and jiayuqiao stations the input data includes daily precipitation temperature sunshine humidity wind speed of 12 meteorological stations from 1960 to 2017 land use data of 1980 1990 2000 2005 and 2015 as well as soil type and thickness jia et al 2001 2006 liu et al 2018 table 3 reflects the simulation effects of the wep l model the average values of r2 in the two hydrological stations during the calibration and verification period are 0 83 and 0 75 respectively the average values of nash are 0 75 and 0 71 respectively the average values of relative error re are 0 04 and 0 03 respectively wang et al 2009 yang et al 2019 it can be seen that the model is suitable for the nrb overall the ideal effect has been achieved and can be used for further calculation of the model 3 4 contributions of land use climate change and human activities to runoff change in different time periods the separation and analysis of river basin climate change other human activities and land use impact on runoff were carried out eq 6 14 the monthly average runoff represents the runoff in each stage and the contribution rate of different influencing factors is separated table 4 in the nrb the runoff of the other human activities increased by 0 91 mm compared with the natural period climate change leads to an increase in runoff in the basin the contribution of the runoff caused by this change accounts for 82 7 of the total change in the runoff among them the contribution rate of land use is 39 3 human activities caused the runoff to decrease and its contribution rate to runoff change reached 17 3 which was lower than the change induced by climate change in the jiayuqiao river basin the runoff depth of the other human activities increased by 18 91 mm and climate factors affected the maximum runoff change reaching 71 5 in general climate change human activities and land use change in two sub basins vary in terms of runoff among them the degree of change in runoff caused by land use change differs according to the land cover of the basin climate change is mainly related to the geographical location of the basin other human activities are mainly related to the distribution of human settlements zheng et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 chang et al 2015 voigt and shaw 2015 4 discussion the formation and change in watershed runoff are related not only to changes in precipitation but also to changes in underlying surface conditions caused by human activities as well as the direct influence of human activities that is to say natural factors and human activities cause variations in the precipitation runoff relationship in the basin the nrb is a typical natural plateau river and it has been shown that the main cause for variation in the relationship between precipitation and runoff is the impact of land use li et al 2018 we analyzed the influence of the precipitation runoff relationship from the following three aspects climate change human activities and land use 1 the rise or fall of temperature over a longer period of time the increase or decrease of precipitation and evaporation the increase or decrease of snow and ice coverage etc will all affect the water cycle replacement capacity of the asia water tower and the carrying capacity of water resources gao et al 2018 the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources and the amount of water resources have a major impact there is also mutual feedback between these components and the plateau water resources show an overall change which is also the effect of these large and small feedback effects according to the annual temperature and geothermal evolution process in the upper reaches of the nujiang river and various meteorological stations the overall average temperature of the basin is significantly increasing the average annual temperature is 0 415 c 10a which is significantly higher than the average temperature rate in china 0 25 c 10a ren and tang 2017 fig 4 the annual average air temperature and surface temperature of various meteorological stations showed an increasing trend the increasing annual average temperature of meteorological stations met the significance test the increase in temperature also led to an increase in the rate of melting of glaciers with a reduction of glaciers between the twice glacier inventory of 1 155 billion m3 year yan et al 2017 the maximum frozen soil depth in the dasa basin is reduced by about 1 1 cm a while the maximum frozen soil depth in the jiayuqiao basin is relatively stable decreasing at a rate of 0 1 cm a yan et al 2017 liu et al 2018 under the influence of climate change glacial and permanent frozen soil meltwater will flow into the river resulting in increased runoff on the other hand according to the evolution process of annual precipitation in the upper reaches of the nujiang river and various meteorological stations the annual precipitation of all meteorological stations shows an increasing trend however the annual precipitation increase trend of the jiayuqiao river basin meteorological station does not satisfy the significance test and the overall increase in precipitation in the basin is not significant 2 the nrb covers two cities and nine counties according to the sixth national census the total population in the upper reaches is about 450 000 the annual water consumption in the basin is about 73 million m3 of which agricultural water consumption is about 52 million m3 chalong and biru power station are built in the nrb for storage or power generation however in general the water conservancy project in the upper reaches of the nujiang river has less impact on the runoff process in the basin 3 according to the distribution of land use in the upper reaches of the nujiang river in 1980 and 2015 assessed with an accuracy of 1000 m provided by the resource and environmental science data center of the chinese academy of sciences the land use in the basin is dominated by grassland followed by unused land mainly including permafrost permanent snow cover and bare land etc mainly distributed in the mountainous areas in the lower reaches of the basin the proportion of cultivated land and residential land is small indicating that the basin is not directly affected by human activities comparing the changes in the land use type of the two phases tables 5a and 5b the overall land use type of the basin varies greatly the overall performance is that due to the impact of global warming the vertical distribution of vegetation is shifted upwards and the area of grassland converted to forest land is 6542 2 km2 therefore vegetation interception and storage in the depression increase additionally the snow cover area of waters and glaciers increase slightly 5 conclusions in this study we investigated the precipitation and runoff distributions of the nrb in the qtp then we attributed the runoff changes to climate change and human activities we diagnosed variations in the relationship between precipitation and runoff in the nrb over a period of 57 years climate change and human activities were analyzed and the land use contribution rate was separated from them we verified the results with related references based on the correlation between precipitation runoff and human activities the result was reasonable this method can be applied to other basins or be used to diagnose variations in relationships between other meteorological and hydrological elements

8389,study region sacramento san joaquin river basin california study focus the study forecasts the streamflow at a regional scale within ssj river basin with largescale climate variables the proposed approach eliminates the bias resulting from predefined indices at regional scale the study was performed for eight unimpaired streamflow stations from 1962 2016 first the singular valued decomposition svd teleconnections of the streamflow corresponding to 500 mbar geopotential height sea surface temperature 500 mbar specific humidity shum500 and 500 mbar u wind u500 were obtained second the skillful svd teleconnections were screened non parametrically finally the screened teleconnections were used as the streamflow predictors in the non linear regression models k nearest neighbor regression and data driven support vector machine new hydrological insights the svd results identified new spatial regions that have not been included in existing predefined indices the nonparametric model indicated the teleconnections of shum500 and u500 being better streamflow predictors compared to other climate variables the regression models were capable to apprehend most of the sustained low flows proving the model to be effective for drought affected regions it was also observed that the proposed approach showed better forecasting skills with preprocessed large scale climate variables rather than using the predefined indices the proposed study is simple yet robust in providing qualitative streamflow forecasts that may assist water managers in making policy related decisions when planning and managing watersheds keywords streamflow forecast climate variability svd svm knn teleconnections 1 introduction streamflow forecast has been given notable focus by the hydrologists and water managers in the past decades chang and chen 2003 besaw et al 2010 yaseen et al 2016 the uncertainty in the streamflow resulting from the hydro climatic variability demands skillful forecasting of streamflow further water stress resulting from increasing population and climate change makes streamflow forecasting more important to enhance future water management decisions several water scarcity problems recently have been encountered due to climate variability and change reduction in available water and increased water demand trenberth 2001 schewe et al 2014 mehran et al 2015 additionally watersheds already facing water scarcity are more vulnerable to further climatic variations mehran et al 2015 increase in the temperature and change in precipitation patterns have imposed severe droughts in the western us crockett and westerling 2018 such as the california drought in 2012 improvements on seasonal streamflow forecasting at regional scales in hydrologically sensitive regions of california can be beneficial to the community and literature comprehending future streamflow behavior and improving long lead forecasts have been a major goal for hydrologists and researchers for solving problems related to rising water demand and reducing water availability however streamflow prediction is a challenging task because streamflow has a complicated nonlinear and nonstationary nature resulting from uncertainties in the underlying hydrologic mechanisms zealand et al 1999 wang et al 2006 the fluctuations in streamflow greatly depend on climate variability and change and climatic fluctuations and its hydrologic effects pose increased uncertainties associated with water supply and its management frederick and major 1997 middelkoop et al 2001 maurer 2007 since a major proportion of domestic water depends on the surface water in streams and rivers increase in population adds to the demand for freshwater and generates management issues of freshwater streams thus determining the interconnection amidst the streamflow and the climatic indices and using them for flow forecasts can help water managers in decision making and can minimize the effects of extreme hydrologic events in the future while forecasting any hydrologic variables the first step is to evaluate the historic correlations between the variables and the climate predictors studies have shown the teleconnection between continental u s hydrology and large scale climatic indices enfield et al 2001 wei and watkins 2011 tamaddun et al 2017 the existence of these teleconnection patterns has appealed to scientists in order to improve long lead forecasts some popular spatial teleconnections among water resource personnel also known as predefined indices are el niño southern oscillations enso pacific decadal oscillations pdo and atlantic multidecadal oscillations amo various studies such as enfield et al 2001 hidalgo muñoz et al 2015 and ehteram et al 2019 have identified the teleconnections of these predefined indices with the hydrology of various regions and often are utilized in hydrologic predictions at various scales hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 2007 kalra and ahmad 2012 ehteram et al 2019 although these indices have proved to be effective in forecasting they have associated regional biases instead of using predefined indices the use of large scale climate variables can reduce the spatial biases related to the regional effects of these predefined indices tootle and piechota 2006 thus identifying and utilizing new teleconnected regions that affect regional hydrology is more beneficial sea surface temperature sst influences evaporation in oceans and pressure variations above the sea s surface which leads to atmospheric circulation omondi et al 2013 500 mbar geopotential height z500 an atmospheric variable used for referencing pressure regimes wallace and gutzler 1981 provides an understanding about the pressure gradient acting as the driving force for the moisture circulation the winter snowpack and resulting spring streamflow in the western us highly depend upon the circulation of moisture from the pacific thus z500 can be streamflow forecaster within western united states wallace and gutzler 1981 used geopotential regimes for various mbar pressure regimes to teleconnect the winter of the northern hemisphere studies also examined the effects of sst and z500 on hydrological parameters sagarika et al 2016 pathak et al 2018 in addition to sst and z500 other climate variables such as specific humidity corresponding to z500 height shum500 and east west wind i e u wind corresponding to z500 height u500 are directly related the atmospheric moisture circulation and may improve the streamflow forecasts u500 is the u wind force per unit area present in the atmosphere while u500 sheds light on the circulation of atmospheric moisture previously pathak et al 2018 have additionally shum500 which entails the information about atmospheric humidity is also associated with the winter snow precipitation as the western us streamflow is primarily driven by winter snowpack testing the prospect of regional streamflow predictions utilizing newly evaluated sst and z500 teleconnections in coordination with that of u500 and shum500 can add to the previous literatures evaluating the teleconnection amongst aforementioned large scale climate variables sst z500 shum500 and u500 and streamflow can remove the regional bias in the streamflow prediction at regional scale singular valued decomposition svd is widely used as a reliable statistical tool to find the teleconnections of two different spatiotemporal climate variables and can be used to relate oceanic atmospheric variabilities with hydrologic variables it is one of the preferred methods of principal component analysis bretherton et al 1992 to evaluate the teleconnections in hydro climatological parameter unlike other principal component analysis pca svd is beneficial as it can be applied to a rectangular cross covariance matrix making it able to evaluate the primary modes of correlation between two variables of different spatiotemporal dimensions svd mostly is used to interrelate hydrologic parameter like streamflow and snowpack to various oceanic atmospheric parameters sagarika et al 2016 pathak et al 2018 svd is a powerful multivariate tool that can simultaneously recognize the oscillations in spatiotemporal data that can be used to find frequencies in order to determine the occurrence of narrowband variance rojsiraphisal et al 2009 utilization of svd can effectively substitute the use of predefined indices statistical prediction of hydrologic time series are mostly associated with the historic observations multiple statistical regression techniques such as multiple linear regression autoregressive moving average models are not effective in considering non linear nature of hydro climatologic phenomenon associated to streamflow artificial intelligence such as artificial neural network ann and support vector machine svm performs better while performing nonlinear time series analysis zhang et al 2018 furthermore studies have shown that svm are more skillful than ann as it less prone to the overfitting kalra et al 2013 svms are data driven machine learning models that use structural risk minimization to reduce anticipated error during learning and minimizes the problem of overfitting li et al 2009 svms perform nonlinear mapping of the input data to a higher dimension feature space where the regression is performed svm initially was formulated for classification and pattern recognition problems in statistical datasets vapnik 1995 1998 2013 later this method evolved to include nonlinear regression and has been applied to hydrologic forecasting by many researchers sivapragasam et al 2001 asefa et al 2006 hong 2008 simões et al 2011 kalra and ahmad 2012 nikam and gupta 2013 like svms another widely used regression technique is k nearest neighbor knn which fits the data locally making it able to capture both linear and nonlinear variability unlike most of the linear regression models which assumes the gaussian distribution of errors knn regression is a non parametric technique which estimates the predictand locally making it able to capture both linear and nonlinear relations between predictors and predictand grantz et al 2005 previous studies have extensively utilized predefined indices to forecast the streamflow which can result in the spatial bias while forecasting the streamflow at regional scale the current research focuses on forecasting the regional streamflow with largescale climate variables first svd was utilized to identify spatial teleconnections between the spring streamflow and largescale climate variables next the modes as indicated by svd were weighted and screened using a kernel density estimator model to generate continuous exceedance probability curves finally weighted predictors were used as input in the regression models knn and data driven svm to provide regional scale streamflow forecasts the major research questions addressed by the current study are 1 what are the spatiotemporal teleconnections between the largescale climate variables and the streamflow at regional scale 2 which climate variables are more skillful for streamflow forecasting 3 is the proposed forecasting approach skillful as compared to the streamflow forecast with predefined indices sst and z500 are more popular for streamflow forecast while the current study also tests the applicability of shum500 and u500 for predicting the streamflow 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the hydrology of the western u s is expected to be affected mostly due to changing climate as the region s runoff cycle is influenced mostly by snowmelt specifically it is anticipated that winter snow accumulation will vary due to the change in climate and melt early in the spring a projected temperature rise of 2 1 c by 2090 is expected to reduce april snowpack thereby reducing spring runoff by 5 6 km3 in sacramento and san joaquin regions of california knowles and cayan 2002 the streamflow forecast in a region like california which has a greater chance of prolonged droughts facilitates planning the management of reservoirs agriculture flood and drought moradkhani and meier 2010 the current study was performed in two u s geological survey usgs hydrologic regions sacramento and san joaquin ssj watershed in california as shown in the fig 1 the sacramento watershed is the upper region in the figure and the san joaquin watershed is the lower region ssj watershed is major water resource to the san francisco estuarine system ssj watershed encompassing a major region of cropland in california is driven mostly by winter precipitation resulting in spring summer streamflow being a snowpack driven watershed ssj watershed may be affected significantly by climate related flow variations vanrheenen et al 2004 forecasting the season ahead streamflow could help in developing strategies to mitigate the effects of droughts in this region data for the hydrologic parameter i e streamflow of the study area was procured from the hydro climatic data network hcdn 2009 lins 2012 the gaging stations included new stations which are part of the gage ii dataset falcone 2011 the stations were unimpaired in other words the watersheds above the gages did not have any anthropogenic impacts data for monthly average streamflow were retrieved from the online database of usgs http www usgs gov the obtained data was monthly streamflow data i e april through june from 1962 2016 these were used to determine the seasonal spring streamflow volume which is used in the current study the data for monthly averaged winter sst from december to february of 1962 2016 i e for 55 years was obtained from the physical science division of the national oceanic and atmospheric noaa administration s earth system research laboratory esrl http www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded the included sst is the most recent dataset of its type available as noaa extended and reconstructed v5 in the aforementioned website previous researchers such as hidalgo 2004 and ellis et al 2010 have correlated variabilities of the atlantic ocean to the hydrology of the western u s this current study also incorporated the atlantic oceanic atmospheric parameters in addition to pacific variabilities the sst data were obtained for each 2 2 degree grid cell of the pacific ocean 30s to 70 n and 100e to 80 w and the atlantic ocean 30s to 70 n and 80 w to 20 w altogether there were 4581 such grids whose sst data were extracted the most recent average monthly z500 shum500 and u500 december february from 1962 2016 i e for 55 years were obtained from https www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded data ncep reanalysis derived pressure html the z500 shum500 and u500 data were obtained for each 2 5 2 5 degree grid cells of the pacific ocean and the atlantic ocean altogether there were 4018 such grids in the pacific and atlantic oceans whose z500 shum500 u500 data were extracted first the spatiotemporal teleconnections were made of various climate predictors sst z500 shum500 and u500 with the hydrologic predictands i e streamflow using svd svd analysis yielded the predictors of streamflow as a temporal expansion series tes next the tes predictors were screened based on nonparametric screening next the probabilistic forecasts were made with the screened tes finally forecasting of the streamflow was conducted using svm knn with the screened predictors all the aforementioned methods are discussed in the following sections 2 2 svd analysis bretherton et al 1992 compared various approaches utilized in relating multiple fields of climate data and found that singular valued decomposition svd is easy to implement and performs well for large time series svd was used as a robust statistical tool to detect the spatiotemporal interrelationship between a predictor i e climatic variability sst z500 shum500 and u500 and a predictand i e the hydrologic parameters of streamflow and precipitation from their cross covariance matrix sagarika et al 2015 details regarding svd can be obtained from bretherton et al 1992 the standardized sst z500 shum500 and u500 anomalies matrices along with standardized streamflow matrices were developed first before evaluating cross covariance matrices over which the svd analysis was performed the standardized climate variable matrix were of the order m t where t the number of columns was equal to the temporal dimension of the data here 55 years similarly m is equivalent to the number of grid cells the standardized streamflow matrix was of the order n t where t is the temporal dimension and the total number of streamflow stations is expressed by n the temporal dimensions of standardized sst z500 shum500 and u500 anomalies matrices along with standardized streamflow matrices were same even though they varied in size spatially svd decomposes the covariance matrix m as usvt where u and v often are the representation for the left matrix and the right matrix s is a central diagonal matrix that comprising non zero singular values eight different left matrices and eight different right matrices were obtained as a result of an independent svd analysis of each variable for both the pacific and atlantic ocean with the streamflow the singular values were organized in decreasing order the first value was termed as the first mode and so on bretherton et al 1992 sagarika et al 2015 the importance of different svd modes can be explained by the squared covariance factor scf scf is the ratio of a corresponding singular value squared to the squared sum of singular values of all the modes bretherton et al 1992 and is summarized in eq 1 1 s c f i s i 2 j 1 r s i 2 where the ith mode scf is indicated by s c f i and s i is the ith mode singular value similar to scf normalized square covariance nsc gives the idea about the correlation among the significantly teleconnected predictors and predictand for each mode it gives the idea about how well each correlated grid cells of climatic variable is linearly associated to significantly teleconnected streamflow stations mathematically nsc is the ratio between singular value squared sums and product of significantly teleconnected number of streamflow stations and grid cells of corresponding climate variables as expressed in eq 2 2 n s c c 2 n s n p where c signifies the squared singular values sum n s is the number of streamflow sites and n p is the total number of gridded data in any predictor sets after the svd results were obtained left tes of first mode were obtained projecting u matrix on standardized climate variable matrix corresponding to first mode similarly right tes of the first mode were obtained from v matrix and standardized streamflow matrix left tes and right tes together holds the consolidated information about primary modes of correlations between streamflow and climate data further left tes retains the primary modes sst z500 shum500 and u500 variability which are associated to the streamflow and which may be unique as compared to the predefined indices thus utilizing the left tes may improve the forecast at the regional scale and is also utilized by previous studies soukup et al 2009 in this study the first mode left tes for most of the predictor had an scf of more than 90 thus explaining more than 90 of the variability thus left tes for the first mode having the information about correlated indices of sst z500 shum500 and u500 was utilized for forecasting altogether svd resulted in eight left tes for all the climate variables considered 2 3 nonparametric approach for predictor screening the nonparametric algorithm adopted in the current study is based on the method to forecast the streamflow proposed by piechota et al 1998 for more details readers are about the method referred to piechota et al 1998 and soukup et al 2009 this approach yields the continuous relation among the predictand and the predictors and the approach also doesn t presume any model structure while the forecast is probabilistic and reports the forecasts at different risk level the shortcoming of this approach is that it assumes the available data to represent the entire population thus the predictor sets showing good skills with this model were selected for final predictions with svm yielding quantitative yearly forecasts as this non parametric model is computationally less complex it can handle multiple inputs in a single instant in shorter time duration as compared to svm proving it to be more convenient screening algorithm the steps involving nonparametric screening is discussed below fig 2 shows how svd and svm are coupled with nonparametric screening algorithm the nonparametric screening of the predictors is summarized in the box with dotted boundaries of fig 2 the inputs to the nonparametric model is the tes resulting from decomposition of cross covariance matrix with svd and output of the nonparametric screening is the input for svm first the probability distribution function pdf was generated for each independent predictor left tes from svd of each predictors z500 sst shum500 and u500 of both atlantic and pacific and ocean utilizing the kernel density estimator kde adopted by piechota et al 1998 to generate the pdf the streamflow and their respective predictors pi are ranked highest to lowest based on the streamflow qi values the first data point is the 6th ranked as minimum of five data points are required to obtain the pdf based on the kde kde is expressed as the following eq 3 3 f x 1 h n i 1 n k x x i h w h e r e f o r g a u s s i a n k e r n e l d e n s i t y e s t i m a t o r h i 0 9 a i h i 1 5 a i m i n σ i i n t e r q

predictor s pdfs for each year s streamflow were obtained with kde once the predictor pdfs were obtained the exceedance probability curve of the streamflow were obtained from the bayes theorem for conditional probabilities as the following eq 4 4 p q i x p i f i x i 1 n p i f i x p i being the probability of occurrence of the streamflow q i based on the observed streamflow dataset f i x is the probability of the predictor x based on the pdfs p q i x is the probability of the streamflow q i for the predictor x later the exceedance probability of the forecast is generated for any given year the skill of the probabilistic exceedance forecast is evaluated with the linear error in probability space leps score the skill for the entire forecast for all years is computed with the average of leps scores sk values the mathematical representation of both leps and leps sk is presented in section 3 4 for screening the predictors the continuous exceedance probability curve of each predictor was combined by assigning random weights to each predictor and the sum of their weights were 1 the forecasts were made with a combined continuous exceedance probability curve in order to optimize the weights assigned to each predictor optimization was done by using the leps sk scores of the forecast which were higher for the better nonparametric forecasts ward and folland 1991 potts et al 1996 leps sk is further described in section 2 6 the predictors with lower weights i e less than 0 1 were rejected the combined continuous exceedance probabilistic forecasts were made again incorporating only the selected predictors and the weights were again optimized for the higher leps sk scores the process was continued until the combination of predictors for each streamflow station was obtained with the maximum leps sk score the final combination of predictors for each station was used in the svm knn 2 4 svm modelling the generalized expression for svm regression technique was abstracted from vapnik 1998 is expressed as 5 f w t φ x i b where ф xi is the input and the coefficients wt weight factor and b bias term are obtained by optimizing the risk function r f which is expressed as eq 6 6 r f c n i 1 n ξ ξ 1 2 w 2 s u b j e c t t o y i j 1 k i 1 l w j x j i b ε ξ i j 1 k i 1 l w j x j i b y i ε ξ i ξ i ξ i 0 where the cost c that is used for generating agreement between the tolerance of the prediction error and the complexity of the function the number of support vectors are denoted by k ξi and ξi which are the slack variables that are the deciding parameters that indicate the level to which the samples should be penalized for the error larger than vapanik s insensitive loss function ε the above discussed standard svm models have associated problem of model complexity to overcome this complexity issue least square svm lssvm was incorporated in the current study lssvm improves upon the standard svm by including equality constraints instead of the inequality one suykens and vandewalle 1999 suykens et al 2002 kuh 2004 the eq 6 of standard svm gets reduced in lssvm to the following eq 7 7 min j w e c 2 i 1 n e i 2 1 2 w t w s u b j e c t t o y i w t φ x i b e i w h e r e i v a r i e s f r o m 1 t o n eq 7 shows the optimization expression in which 1 2 w t w helps to adjust the weight and c 2 i 1 n e i 2 is the penalty function the error in the ith prediction of y i is e i the optimization of eq 7 is done utilizing the langrangian multipliers as shown in eq 8 below 8 f x i 1 n a i k x x i b where a i is the langrangian multiplier and k x x i is the kernel function responsible for operating the data in higher dimension feature space without finding the data coordinates in the higher dimension some of the examples of the kernel functions are linear kernel gaussian kernel radial basis kernel function rbf rbf kernel was utilized in the current study which have better skills over other kernel functions scholkopf et al 1997 kalra et al 2013 the rbf kernel on samples x and xi is expressed as the following eq 9 9 k x x i e x p x x i 2 2 σ 2 the hyper parameter σ is obtained by optimizing the error and improving the forecast in the training and testing period the hyper parameters are evaluated with grid based search twarakavi et al 2009 this removes uncertainty which estimates best combination with minimum error as in eq 3 all sets of possible hyper parameters is considered to calculate the error the reasonable feature space is generated for each sets of hyper parameter based on the possible lowest and highest values cost function ranging from 0 001 1000 and the slack variable ranging from 0 001 100 for optimizing the grid based hyper parametrization and for efficient computation the increment of 0 01 was selected and the optimization was done for the minimal mean square error this hyper parametrization results in dense clusters and also reduces the prediction uncertainty asefa et al 2006 kalra and ahmad 2012 optimizing the hyper parameter have large number of support vectors but a smooth model which does not mean overfitting validating a data driven model is crucial in determining the forecast reliability traditional data driven models are divided into training and testing period which has its own disadvantage while dealing with periodic time series as oceanic atmospheric variables manifest different types of periodicity breaking the data into training and testing periods may not reproduce comparable results for various training and testing data sets thus to control the error caused by breaking the samples into training and testing periods for support vector regression moving period svm was implemented thus reducing the model sensitivity and prediction uncertainty kalra and ahmad 2012 for more details about moving period cross validation approach readers are referred to stone 1974 and geisser 1975 instead of dividing the entire data into specific training and testing period k fold moving period algorithm is utilized with k 1 also known as leave one out technique for the time series of n years the data for one year was selected for testing while other mutually exclusive n 1 year s data were used for training purpose the process was repeated for the entire time series i e n times with mutually exclusive training period during each iteration final predictions were obtained by pooling all the predictions made by svm with all training and testing periods in order to evaluate the strength of the svm approach and to access whether multiple training and testing samples do not reproduce varying outputs the bootstrap technique was incorporated in this current study the bootstrap approach which was first developed by efron 1979 and described further by efron and tibshirani 1993 addition of bootstrap technique adds extra layer of validation to the svm model it was implemented in this study to evaluate how well the svm model results generalized while using an independent dataset svm was trained with a bootstrapped data sample and then tested on the entire measured dataset for a given dataset if the size of the dataset is n the bootstrap sample was generated by sampling n instances from the data with replacement the bootstrap resampling process was iterated to obtain 100 combinations corresponding to the measured value of each year for each station finally the average of 100 combination results was calculated as the final estimation for a reliable forecast the svm results should be consistent with and without implementation of bootstrap resampling approach 2 5 knn regression like svms another widely used regression technique is k nearest neighbor unlike conventionally used linear regression models which assumes the gaussian distribution of errors knn regression is a non parametric technique which estimates the predictand locally making it able to capture both linear and nonlinear relations between predictors and predictand grantz et al 2005 the linear regression can be expressed as the following eq 10 10 y f x 1 x 2 x 3 x 1 e where f is the function fitting the predictor indices x1 x2 x3 xp to the predictand like streamflow y with the error e assumed to be following gaussian distribution the non parametric regression like knn lall and sharma 1996 rajagopalan and lall 1999 kernel based regression piechota et al 1998 and locally weighted polynomials lwp loader 1999 on the other hand estimate f locally making them capable to model both local and global variations in the datasets the knn regression in the current research utilized the properties of both knn and lwp first the order of the polynomial and the neighborhood size are obtained based on generalized cross validation function gcv the gcv and its application is expressed in following eq 11 11 g c v k p i 1 n e i 2 n 1 m n 2 where regression error in ith data is represented as ei total data points number is represented by n and number of parameters is represented by m the nearest neighbors for each of the data point were obtained and the polynomials were fitted locally the streamflow ynew was obtained from the local fit for each ith input sets the error between ith ynew and ith y data is ei higher weight is then assigned to the nearest neighbor as compared to less near neighbor the weight for k nearest neighbor is distributed as shown in following eq 12 12 w j 1 j i 1 k 1 i for any new value of predictor say xnew ynew is predicted as mentioned above after finding the nearest neighbor and so on the error for the nearest neighbor xn is then calculated as en the error en is then summed to the forecast mean ynew en to evaluate one member of the ensemble forecast the number of neighbors adopted to generate the ensemble should may vary as compared to the number of neighbors adopted while evaluating local polynomials selection procedures for the number of nearest neighbor can be referred to rajagopalan and lall 1999 apart from other statistics the efficacy of the ensemble forecasts is evaluated by incorporating ranked probability skill score rpss rpss signifies whether the model s performance to apprehend categorical probability is better than the categorical probability of the historic data climatology for the current study the ensemble forecast and the climatological data are categorized as terciles 0 33rd percentile 34 66th percentile 67 100th percentile here the categorical probability is the proportion of the data out of the total falling in each category tercile the ranked probability score rps for the forecast and the climatology is evaluated first before evaluating the rpss eq 13 given below was utilized for calculation of rps of each year 13 r p s m 1 k i 1 m p i i 1 m d i 2 for the current study k was three as the ensemble was divided into three categories the categorical probability of the ensemble forecast for ith category pi is ratio of the number of members of ensemble forecast falling in the ith category to the total number of ensemble members the parameter di is one if the observed streamflow falls in ith category else it is zero after evaluating rps for forecast and the climatology rpss is evaluated as following eq 14 14 r p s s 1 r p s f o r e c a s t r p s c l i m a t o l o g y positive rpss suggests that the forecast is skillful as compared to the climatology while the rpss of 1 shows the perfect forecast the negative rpss signifies that the model performs worse than the climatology the rps and rpss were calculated for each year independently 2 6 assessment of forecasted streamflow reliability using statistical parameters the agreement between the observed and estimated streamflow in this study was evaluated with the correlation coefficient r percentage bias pbias and nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse all above mentioned statistical performance measures are described in moriasi et al 2007 further the cumulative non exceedance probability was estimated using leps skill sk which was used to access the forecast skill as compared to climatological mean the expression of r pbias and nse is expressed in following eqs 15 16 and 17 respectively 15 r i 1 n x i m e s x m e a n m e s x i e s t x m e a n e s t i 1 n x i m e s x m e a n m e s 2 i 1 n x i e s t x m e a n e s t 2 16 p b i a s i 1 n x i m e s x i e s t i 1 n x i m e s 17 n s e i 1 n x i m e s x i e s t 2 i 1 n x i m e s x m e a n m e s 2 where x i m e s is the observed measured streamflow and x i e s t is the forecasted estimated streamflow x m e a n m e s is the average observed measured streamflow and x m e a n e s t is the average forecasted estimated streamflow the correlation coefficient r signifies the linear relationship among the measured and estimated streamflow it ranges between negative and positive 1 a higher magnitude of r shows the good relationship between the two variables the streamflow forecast is said to be reliable if r is close to positive 1 signifying a low amount of errors in the forecast the percentage bias is the measure of average tendency of biasness of the estimated forecasts as compared to the actual one the optimal pbias is 0 signifying the minimum biasness of the forecast the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse is popular when assessing the predictive capabilities of the hydrologic model nash and sutcliffe 1970 nse ranges from to 1 where 1 is the best nse score signifying a perfect agreement among the estimated and observed streamflow the leps skill parameterizes the difference between the observed and estimated streamflow in terms of the cumulative probability distribution potts et al 1996 the expression for the leps score derived from potts et al 1996 is summarized in eq 18 18 s 3 1 p f p 0 p f 2 p f p 0 2 1 where p f is the cumulative probability for the forecasted streamflow and p 0 is the cumulative probability for the observed streamflow an accurate forecast far from the climatological mean will have a higher leps score and are considered to be good forecasts the average leps sk is computed with eq 19 19 s k s s m 100 where s is the total leps score for all years the leps score is the sum for the best forecast represented by s m when s is positive the cumulative probability distribution of observed and predicted streamflow are same for negative s sm is the sum of leps score for the poor forecasts the model is considered to have good performance if leps sk is greater than 10 and its value ranges from 100 to 100 potts et al 1996 3 results and discussion first the results obtained by tele connecting the predictors and predictands using svd is presented in this section and their physical significance is discussed next results of screening of the predictors based on leps score and exceedance probability curve is explained finally the svm forecast results and cross validated results are presented and discussed 3 1 svd after individual svd analysis for both river basins the sacramento and the san joaquin the variability of the streamflow gages were explained by the first modes of all the predictors with in each case scfs greater than 90 after applying the svd separately on both watersheds the correlations generated as left tes were used for further analysis the svd results which are explained in this section are shown as significant regions in figs 3 and 4 these are regions with signs regions with signs which are the regions of increasing decreasing oceanic atmospheric variabilities for the first mode of svd for the sacramento river basin fig 3a shows the 90 significance correlation map representing pacific climate variabilities and fig 4a shows the 90 significant region for the atlantic ocean s climate variabilities 90 significant regions signify that there is a 10 chance of the results to be false positive so the results have 90 confidence similarly results for the san joaquin watershed is shown in fig 3b for the pacific and fig 4b for the atlantic sst for the first mode explains most of the variability in each watershed of the study area as compared to other modes of sst the sst teleconnected regions for sacramento river basins are positively correlated which means the increase in sst in the teleconnected regions with sign results in the increase in seasonal flow and vice versa the increase in z500 shum500 and u500 in the teleconnected regions in figs 3a and 4 a with sign results in the decrease in streamflow in sacramento river basin and vice versa as these regions are negatively correlated with the streamflow similarly sst z500 and u500 teleconnected regions of pacific ocean shown in fig 3b are positively correlated with the streamflow of san joaquin river basin the increase in these regions result in the increase decrease in streamflow of san joaquin river basin respectively on the other hand shum500 teleconnected regions shown in fig 3b are negatively correlated with the streamflow the z500 region below alaska was out of phase with the streamflow stations for both the sacramento and san joaquin watersheds in other words these regions had negative correlations to the streamflow this shows a connection to variability in the aleutian low al lower than average pressures in the al region signify an increase in the frequency or intensity of storm tracks moving across the pacific ocean toward north america this in turn leads to increased precipitation along the pacific northwest of the u s down to the sacramento and san joaquin watersheds furthermore the close contours of z500 signify a rapid change of geopotential index levels which can be taken as the origin of the polar jet streams the polar jet streams play a key role in the advection of moisture to the west coast of the u s from the pacific ocean physically a higher shum500 in the alaskan gulf signifies a greater amount of dec feb precipitation in the u s pacific northwest suggesting the effect of jet stream that reduces the precipitation and runoff in the ssj river basin the lower shum500 in the california region resulting in lower streamflow signifies less dec feb winter precipitation and low apr jun runoff u500 teleconnected regions shown in figs 3a and b are similar to the pattern of the jet stream moving to the western coast of the u s through the pacific this signifies that the moisture that gets transformed to streamflow in the region is driven by the jet stream in addition to the westerlies the trough of the jet stream shifts eastwards and westwards in the pacific during various phases of enso thus the jet stream sometimes has a higher probability of passing through the ssj watershed resulting in higher than normal precipitation and runoff in other instances the jet stream moves storm tracks along the alaskan and canadian coasts and passes through the northwestern u s above california this increases the precipitation and streamflow in the northwestern u s but lowers the amount of runoff and precipitation in california the standardized left tes for the first mode climate variables of sst and z500 along with shum500 and u500 of both pacific ocean and atlantic ocean obtained from the svd analysis are summarized in fig 5 column a of fig 3 represents the left tes for sacramento watershed while the ltes results for san joaquin river basin is shown in column b the solid line in fig 5 represents the left tes corresponding to the pacific ocean and the one corresponding to the atlantic ocean is represented by dotted lines table 1 summarizes the scf and nsc values expressed in percentage corresponding to all predictors of ssj watershed as seen in the figure scfs are mostly greater than 90 showing that the first mode of teleconnections captured most of the teleconnections between the streamflow and the climate variables similarly nsc is 100 for the perfect correlation which signifies 100 correlation among all streamflow values and the predictor values for each grid 100 nsc is impractical to anticipate while the nsc values tabulated in the table 1 is comparable to the previous studies for the current study the nscs ranged from1 5 to 3 5 while pathak et al 2018 evaluated the nscs ranging from 1 78 to 3 87 for western us snowpack similarly sagarika et al 2015 evaluated the correlation coefficient ranging from 0 009 to 0 64 for western us apr jun streamflow 3 2 nonparametric screening svd results show that the first mode scfs are highly significant more than any other modes in terms of explaining the variability of the streamflow thus taking into account the first mode left tes s for all oceanic atmospheric variables could prove to be a skillful predictor for the streamflow stations under consideration further based on the exceedance results i e the leps skill for the models the best combination of predictors for each station were evaluated in addition they can be used to make probabilistic forecasts by using a continuous exceedance probability curve as shown in fig 6 additionally a good model should be able to forecast the flow more accurately than can the climatology 1981 2010 to evaluate the model skill relative to the climatology 1981 2010 leps skill was evaluated the leps sk above 20 is categorized as good forecast as shown in fig 6 similarly as shown in the fig 6 the leps sk between 10 and 20 is categorized as fair forecast and the leps sk less than 10 is categorized as poor forecast fig 6 shows the exceedance probability forecasts for station 1 for 2013 2016 and 2015 which were the good fair and poor forecast years respectively the forecast year 2013 for station 1 was a good year because at a 50 exceedance level i e 50 risk the forecast shown as solid line in fig 6 lies close to the observed streamflow volume shown as a circle in fig 6 as compared to the climatology shown as the dotted line with leps skill scores 24 56 on the other hand there are risks in predicting the flow in a poor forecast year such as 2015 for station 1 as shown in fig 6 however the model behaves well and is comparable to the climatology at 50 exceedance level for even these years although the model had associated errors by averaging the entire period of 54 years the model was skillful with the leps score approaching 10 thus the models with highest leps scores were selected and their predictors were used for further svm modeling the best combination of the predictors were the first mode left tes of shum500 pacific and u500 pacific for streamflow stations 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 yielding the maximum leps score similarly shum500 pacific shum500 atlantic and u500 pacific were found to be the best predictors for site 1 which had an optimum leps score based on the weight for different predictors of the best model for each station shum500 and u500 of pacific were more skillful for the streamflow forecast of the ssj watershed previously sst was widely used by various researchers to predict the precipitation and streamflow uvo et al 1998 westra and sharma 2010 in addition z500 was widely used for the same purpose serreze et al 1998 the current study identified that one month lagged winter variability of pacific shum500 and pacific u500 proved to be more effective in predicting the april to june streamflow of ssj watershed compared to sst and z500 although individual svd analysis with each variables resulted in the teleconnected regions but shum500 and u500 were skillful predictor for the streamflow based on the non parametric screening which can be explained physically the apr jun streamflow in ssj watershed is driven primarily by the winter dec feb snow precipitation within the region furthermore winter snow precipitation highly depends upon the pacific shum500 and u500 both shum500 and u500 variabilities corresponds to the moisture circulation from the pacific toward western united states during the winter months shum500 captures the amount of moisture circulated from the pacific similarly u500 provides the information about jet streams which drives the moist air rising from the pacific ocean towards the western united states 3 3 svm the results of svm in fig 7 a shows the time series plots for individual streamflow stations of the ssj river basin the statistical parameters i e r pbias and nse for the forecasted streamflow with svm are presented in fig 7b fig 7c shows the distribution of measured and estimated streamflow and fig 7d represents the leps sk of the forecast bootstrap cross validation result of the svm model is presented in fig 8 the unit of streamflow represented as normal is the percentage of the average measured observed streamflow the time series plots in fig 7a incorporate the measured observed streamflow and svm estimates estimated streamflow as the normal of the mean observed flow of the streamflow at each gage stations in fig 7a dashed lines show measured and the solid lines show the svm estimated streamflow the time series plots indicate that the current approach was able to predict most of the high flows and low flows although some events were missed the magnitudes of error were not very high the model was good at predicting most of the low flows as well as sustained low flows the capability of capturing sustained low flows makes the model effective for water managers for sustainable flow management in drought affected regions a robust harmony between the observed and the predicted values was observed from the time series plots according to moriasi et al 2007 the simulated model was considered to have very good performance in terms of pbias which was less than 10 for each streamflow stations of the ssj watershed the current model had a minimum r of 0 87 ranging to 0 96 the model was assumed to have a very good performance rating as r was greater than 0 85 this indicates that the correlation coefficient ranks the model as a very good one for ssj watershed nse ranged between 0 73 and 0 82 further moriasi et al 2007 ranked the model as a very good one if nse ranged in between 0 75 and 1 which was mostly true for this hybrid model thus based on nse r and pbias the hybrid model was reliable with very good performance these statistical parameters are well described in moriasi et al 2007 further moriasi et al 2007 established model evaluation guidelines based on the range of these parameters these parameters showed that the model forecasted results in good correlation with the observed values the scatterplots in fig 7b represent good agreement among the measured and estimated streamflow volumes for the ssj river basins respectively as in all scatterplots the major number points were aligned and were close to the 45 bisector line the flow volume for spring april to june is presented as the normal of the mean observed streamflow from the scatterplot this can be visualized that the model forecast is in agreement to the observed streamflow using boxplots fig 7c compare the measured and estimated spring streamflow for the ssj watershed for most of the stations the model was able to apprehend low flows as compared to the high flows as can be seen from the box plots the 5th percentile of the estimated flow resembled that of the measured flow the model ability to capture the low flow makes it useful for the water managers working on drought affective the accuracy of the svm forecast relative to the climatological mean was evaluated as the cumulative non exceedance probability error which was calculated and evaluated as the leps sk score the probabilistic cumulative error among measured and estimated streamflow is shown in fig 7d for the ssj river basin according to potts et al 1996 the outcome is said to be random if sk 0 and the model is said to perform well if sk 10 in this study the sk 60 for all stations with a minimum of 62 9 and a maximum of 80 4 from fig 7d nearly 80 of the predictions for site 6 had 10 error thus the performance of the model was better for station 6 in the sacramento watershed as compared to other stations of ssj watershed these leps sk scores ascertained the robustness of the model as a forecasting tool for water managers as the model skill was better than when using climatology techniques fig 8 shows the time series plots for measured estimated and cross validated streamflow values for the study period for each station of the ssj watershed again good agreement among the measured predicted and bootstrapped time series was observed the bootstrapped cross validation outcome reaffirms the robustness of the svm model the results of the model were stable and did not vary with changes in the training and testing datasets the bootstrapped results showed agreement with the estimated time series following a similar trend as that of the estimated time series plots after screening the predictors and using them to forecast using svm it was observed that the model performance was acceptable based on the accessed statistical skills as evident from the time series plots the cross validated and estimated flows were similar to the observed streamflow the model performed well as the estimated flow followed the 45 bisector line indicating the good fit results the overall model performance was acceptable as the predictions were associated with low errors there was good agreement to the measured flow although sometimes that was difficult to capture during such events as the high flows of sacramento in 2005 and 2006 based on the evaluations of model performance against climatology 1981 2010 using leps skill scores the model predictor seemed to serve well in forecasting the streamflow as compared to climatology this indicates that the model performance worked adequately well for ssj watershed especially when capturing the low flows as evident from the time series plots the model s ability to capture sustained low flows may prove to be a promising resource for water managers especially in regions facing prolonged droughts such as the western u s the performed svm regression incorporated primary modes of four different types of largescale climate variables to improve the streamflow at the regional scale in the ssj river basin of the drought affect northern california the skill of the forecast based on all the presented statistical evaluations were within the acceptable limits larger correlation coefficients and larger nse accompanied with smaller pbias confirms the model accuracy higher skills of svm can be attributed to both preprocessing the large scale climate variables with svd and the non parametric screening of the svd teleconnections to establish the hypothesis that the use of large scale climate variable have improved the forecast skill forecast were also made with predefined indices for the evaluation of the proposed approach which is presented below the robustness of the proposed approach of utilizing the primary modes of large scale teleconnections for streamflow forecasting is further reaffirmed with the streamflow forecast results based on the predefined indices as shown in fig 9 fig 9 shows streamflow forecasts with three combinations pacific ocean s predefined indices niño 3 4 pdo and niño 3 4 pdo corresponding to site 5 where niño 3 4 an enso index ranging from 120th to 170th west longitudes on both sides of equator by 5 degrees the first column of fig 9 shows the time series of the forecast utilizing niño 3 4 predefined index along with the scatter plots box plots and non exceedance probability curve similarly second and third column of fig 9 shows the results of streamflow forecast utilizing pdo index and both pdo and niño 3 4 respectively the forecast with niño 3 4 and pdo indices but the proposed approach of utilizing the primary modes of large scale teleconnections results had better statistical skills the maximum nse as shown in fig 9b for site 5 was 0 66 while the nse utilizing the large scale climate variable was 0 73 as shown in fig 7b similarly the correlation coefficient between the measured and observed streamflow volume forecasted with large scale climate variable was 0 87 which was higher than the maximum correlation coefficient of 0 82 for the forecast obtained utilizing the predefined indices similarly the leps sk of the model utilizing the predefined indices for site 5 as shown in fig 7d is less as compared to the leps sk for site 5 shown in fig 7d corresponding to the forecast with large scale climate variable 3 4 knn after svm regression the rationale to include knn was to establish the confidence that the teleconnections of the regional streamflow values with the large scale climate variables are skillful in any regression other than svm the knn forecast of the ssj river basin is presented in fig 10 as the boxplot representing the medians quartiles and the outliers with 100 forecasts for each year at each station the figures also include the time series plots of the observed streamflow to compare the ensemble forecast with the observed streamflow values all streamflow in fig 10 are presented as the normal of the mean observed streamflow at each gage stations from fig 10 it is evident that observed measured streamflow lies within the boxes of the ensemble forecasts suggesting good model performance capable of capturing most of the flows including high flows and low flows in the interquartile range the ability of knn model to capture the streamflow peaks showed the effectiveness of the coupled svd and non parametric screening algorithm the predictors evaluated with coupled svd and non parametric screening were able to capture the streamflow variabilities asymmetry of the boxes around the median shows the skewness of the forecast captured due to resampling of the data the quantitative evaluation of the knn is performed with rpss correlation coefficient r percentage bias pbias and nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse the parameters r pbias and nse are calculated with the mean of the ensemble forecast evaluating the mean ensemble forecast the aforementioned parameters are tabulated in the table 2 the simulated knn model was considered to have very good performance in terms of pbias which was less than 10 for each streamflow stations of the ssj watershed the current model had a minimum r of 0 83 ranging to 0 90 the model was assumed to have a very good performance rating as r was greater than 0 85 except for one station this indicates that the correlation coefficient ranks the model as a very good one for ssj watershed nse ranged between 0 67 and 0 79 further moriasi et al 2007 ranked the model as a good one if nse ranged in between 0 65 and 0 75 and very good for the stations with nse ranged in between 0 75 and 1 the rpss presented in the table is the median value of the 55 years rpss obtained for each streamflow stations the positive rpss indicates the ensemble forecast having better skill than climatology further the rpss closer to 1 signifies more skillful forecast similar to the svm model knn was also capable to capture the variations in the streamflow like high flows and the low flows as seen in the fig 10 where the peaks of the observed time series lies within the box plots of the ensemble forecasts further it was also able to capture the sustained low flows making the model useful in drought prone regions forecasting the streamflow with climate indices can result in errors in the forecast because of the inability of climate indices to capture every underlying physical process to overcome this the use of largescale climate variable teleconnections with the regional streamflow can lead to better inclusion of regional climate systems further to improve the model results extensive care was taken while choosing the largescale climate predictors based on the regional geography climate processes the climate variables utilized were skillful in capturing local climate features affecting the streamflow the approach is purely statistical and it can perform well at the regional scales but the underlying physical drivers of the streamflow cannot be fully understood while the advantage of using the statistical model is that it is easy to implement and these models are not prone to parameter uncertainty future studies can be done in other regions with the clear overview of different sets of climate variables effecting the streamflow within the region in the current approach both svm and knn were able to capture the extreme hydrological extremes with minor deviation between the forecast and the observed streamflow overall the both model s forecast were skillful during the stud period and can lead to in making month ahead seasonal water management strategies 4 conclusions in this study a new approach to forecast seasonal streamflow volume was developed as an improvement to those developed in previous researches in order to improve streamflow forecast with predefined indices this study utilized teleconnections obtained from svd analysis to predict streamflow volume in conjunction with nonparametric screening and the nonlinear regression model like svm and knn the first advantage of the adopted framework was that it subsides the use of predefined indices with the aid of svd the second advantage was utilizing the non parametric approach to screen the svd relations this lead to segregate the skillful svd relations that would enhance the input of the regression model finally using the svm and knn as a regression tool established the robustness of the forecast four different oceanic atmospheric variables sst and z500 along with shum500 and u500 over the pacific ocean and atlantic ocean were utilized to improve the streamflow forecast at the regional scale the first research question was addressed with the help of svd analysis by finding the new teleconnected regions corresponding toshum500 and u500 in addition to sst and z500over pacific and atlantic oceans for the ssj watershed streamflow the second research question was addressed with the non parametric screening showing that the shum500 and u500 of pacific were the best predictors for the streamflow of ssj watershed the proposed forecasting approach utilizing the large scale climate variables were skillful based on the statistical evaluations the proposed forecast approach were more reliable than streamflow forecasts performed using the predefined indices in the selected study area this was the answer for the final research question as the forecasts is truly based on the statistical principles the physical processes involved in the variations of streamflow cannot be understood the forecasts made by data driven models improve with increase in the training period the current study incorporated 55 years of available streamflow data the training period of the current model could be improved in future by including reconstruction data in addition to the instrumental records forecasts for different lead times also could be evaluated in the future to determine the lead time at which the model performs the best in a selected study area finally using this proposed method in different regions with different types of datasets may lead to a better understanding of the implications of the model the current research is important for season ahead prediction of streamflow values in the ssj watersheds a major cropland of california with the teleconnected parameters of the pacific and atlantic oceans the study used

8389,study region sacramento san joaquin river basin california study focus the study forecasts the streamflow at a regional scale within ssj river basin with largescale climate variables the proposed approach eliminates the bias resulting from predefined indices at regional scale the study was performed for eight unimpaired streamflow stations from 1962 2016 first the singular valued decomposition svd teleconnections of the streamflow corresponding to 500 mbar geopotential height sea surface temperature 500 mbar specific humidity shum500 and 500 mbar u wind u500 were obtained second the skillful svd teleconnections were screened non parametrically finally the screened teleconnections were used as the streamflow predictors in the non linear regression models k nearest neighbor regression and data driven support vector machine new hydrological insights the svd results identified new spatial regions that have not been included in existing predefined indices the nonparametric model indicated the teleconnections of shum500 and u500 being better streamflow predictors compared to other climate variables the regression models were capable to apprehend most of the sustained low flows proving the model to be effective for drought affected regions it was also observed that the proposed approach showed better forecasting skills with preprocessed large scale climate variables rather than using the predefined indices the proposed study is simple yet robust in providing qualitative streamflow forecasts that may assist water managers in making policy related decisions when planning and managing watersheds keywords streamflow forecast climate variability svd svm knn teleconnections 1 introduction streamflow forecast has been given notable focus by the hydrologists and water managers in the past decades chang and chen 2003 besaw et al 2010 yaseen et al 2016 the uncertainty in the streamflow resulting from the hydro climatic variability demands skillful forecasting of streamflow further water stress resulting from increasing population and climate change makes streamflow forecasting more important to enhance future water management decisions several water scarcity problems recently have been encountered due to climate variability and change reduction in available water and increased water demand trenberth 2001 schewe et al 2014 mehran et al 2015 additionally watersheds already facing water scarcity are more vulnerable to further climatic variations mehran et al 2015 increase in the temperature and change in precipitation patterns have imposed severe droughts in the western us crockett and westerling 2018 such as the california drought in 2012 improvements on seasonal streamflow forecasting at regional scales in hydrologically sensitive regions of california can be beneficial to the community and literature comprehending future streamflow behavior and improving long lead forecasts have been a major goal for hydrologists and researchers for solving problems related to rising water demand and reducing water availability however streamflow prediction is a challenging task because streamflow has a complicated nonlinear and nonstationary nature resulting from uncertainties in the underlying hydrologic mechanisms zealand et al 1999 wang et al 2006 the fluctuations in streamflow greatly depend on climate variability and change and climatic fluctuations and its hydrologic effects pose increased uncertainties associated with water supply and its management frederick and major 1997 middelkoop et al 2001 maurer 2007 since a major proportion of domestic water depends on the surface water in streams and rivers increase in population adds to the demand for freshwater and generates management issues of freshwater streams thus determining the interconnection amidst the streamflow and the climatic indices and using them for flow forecasts can help water managers in decision making and can minimize the effects of extreme hydrologic events in the future while forecasting any hydrologic variables the first step is to evaluate the historic correlations between the variables and the climate predictors studies have shown the teleconnection between continental u s hydrology and large scale climatic indices enfield et al 2001 wei and watkins 2011 tamaddun et al 2017 the existence of these teleconnection patterns has appealed to scientists in order to improve long lead forecasts some popular spatial teleconnections among water resource personnel also known as predefined indices are el niño southern oscillations enso pacific decadal oscillations pdo and atlantic multidecadal oscillations amo various studies such as enfield et al 2001 hidalgo muñoz et al 2015 and ehteram et al 2019 have identified the teleconnections of these predefined indices with the hydrology of various regions and often are utilized in hydrologic predictions at various scales hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 2007 kalra and ahmad 2012 ehteram et al 2019 although these indices have proved to be effective in forecasting they have associated regional biases instead of using predefined indices the use of large scale climate variables can reduce the spatial biases related to the regional effects of these predefined indices tootle and piechota 2006 thus identifying and utilizing new teleconnected regions that affect regional hydrology is more beneficial sea surface temperature sst influences evaporation in oceans and pressure variations above the sea s surface which leads to atmospheric circulation omondi et al 2013 500 mbar geopotential height z500 an atmospheric variable used for referencing pressure regimes wallace and gutzler 1981 provides an understanding about the pressure gradient acting as the driving force for the moisture circulation the winter snowpack and resulting spring streamflow in the western us highly depend upon the circulation of moisture from the pacific thus z500 can be streamflow forecaster within western united states wallace and gutzler 1981 used geopotential regimes for various mbar pressure regimes to teleconnect the winter of the northern hemisphere studies also examined the effects of sst and z500 on hydrological parameters sagarika et al 2016 pathak et al 2018 in addition to sst and z500 other climate variables such as specific humidity corresponding to z500 height shum500 and east west wind i e u wind corresponding to z500 height u500 are directly related the atmospheric moisture circulation and may improve the streamflow forecasts u500 is the u wind force per unit area present in the atmosphere while u500 sheds light on the circulation of atmospheric moisture previously pathak et al 2018 have additionally shum500 which entails the information about atmospheric humidity is also associated with the winter snow precipitation as the western us streamflow is primarily driven by winter snowpack testing the prospect of regional streamflow predictions utilizing newly evaluated sst and z500 teleconnections in coordination with that of u500 and shum500 can add to the previous literatures evaluating the teleconnection amongst aforementioned large scale climate variables sst z500 shum500 and u500 and streamflow can remove the regional bias in the streamflow prediction at regional scale singular valued decomposition svd is widely used as a reliable statistical tool to find the teleconnections of two different spatiotemporal climate variables and can be used to relate oceanic atmospheric variabilities with hydrologic variables it is one of the preferred methods of principal component analysis bretherton et al 1992 to evaluate the teleconnections in hydro climatological parameter unlike other principal component analysis pca svd is beneficial as it can be applied to a rectangular cross covariance matrix making it able to evaluate the primary modes of correlation between two variables of different spatiotemporal dimensions svd mostly is used to interrelate hydrologic parameter like streamflow and snowpack to various oceanic atmospheric parameters sagarika et al 2016 pathak et al 2018 svd is a powerful multivariate tool that can simultaneously recognize the oscillations in spatiotemporal data that can be used to find frequencies in order to determine the occurrence of narrowband variance rojsiraphisal et al 2009 utilization of svd can effectively substitute the use of predefined indices statistical prediction of hydrologic time series are mostly associated with the historic observations multiple statistical regression techniques such as multiple linear regression autoregressive moving average models are not effective in considering non linear nature of hydro climatologic phenomenon associated to streamflow artificial intelligence such as artificial neural network ann and support vector machine svm performs better while performing nonlinear time series analysis zhang et al 2018 furthermore studies have shown that svm are more skillful than ann as it less prone to the overfitting kalra et al 2013 svms are data driven machine learning models that use structural risk minimization to reduce anticipated error during learning and minimizes the problem of overfitting li et al 2009 svms perform nonlinear mapping of the input data to a higher dimension feature space where the regression is performed svm initially was formulated for classification and pattern recognition problems in statistical datasets vapnik 1995 1998 2013 later this method evolved to include nonlinear regression and has been applied to hydrologic forecasting by many researchers sivapragasam et al 2001 asefa et al 2006 hong 2008 simões et al 2011 kalra and ahmad 2012 nikam and gupta 2013 like svms another widely used regression technique is k nearest neighbor knn which fits the data locally making it able to capture both linear and nonlinear variability unlike most of the linear regression models which assumes the gaussian distribution of errors knn regression is a non parametric technique which estimates the predictand locally making it able to capture both linear and nonlinear relations between predictors and predictand grantz et al 2005 previous studies have extensively utilized predefined indices to forecast the streamflow which can result in the spatial bias while forecasting the streamflow at regional scale the current research focuses on forecasting the regional streamflow with largescale climate variables first svd was utilized to identify spatial teleconnections between the spring streamflow and largescale climate variables next the modes as indicated by svd were weighted and screened using a kernel density estimator model to generate continuous exceedance probability curves finally weighted predictors were used as input in the regression models knn and data driven svm to provide regional scale streamflow forecasts the major research questions addressed by the current study are 1 what are the spatiotemporal teleconnections between the largescale climate variables and the streamflow at regional scale 2 which climate variables are more skillful for streamflow forecasting 3 is the proposed forecasting approach skillful as compared to the streamflow forecast with predefined indices sst and z500 are more popular for streamflow forecast while the current study also tests the applicability of shum500 and u500 for predicting the streamflow 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the hydrology of the western u s is expected to be affected mostly due to changing climate as the region s runoff cycle is influenced mostly by snowmelt specifically it is anticipated that winter snow accumulation will vary due to the change in climate and melt early in the spring a projected temperature rise of 2 1 c by 2090 is expected to reduce april snowpack thereby reducing spring runoff by 5 6 km3 in sacramento and san joaquin regions of california knowles and cayan 2002 the streamflow forecast in a region like california which has a greater chance of prolonged droughts facilitates planning the management of reservoirs agriculture flood and drought moradkhani and meier 2010 the current study was performed in two u s geological survey usgs hydrologic regions sacramento and san joaquin ssj watershed in california as shown in the fig 1 the sacramento watershed is the upper region in the figure and the san joaquin watershed is the lower region ssj watershed is major water resource to the san francisco estuarine system ssj watershed encompassing a major region of cropland in california is driven mostly by winter precipitation resulting in spring summer streamflow being a snowpack driven watershed ssj watershed may be affected significantly by climate related flow variations vanrheenen et al 2004 forecasting the season ahead streamflow could help in developing strategies to mitigate the effects of droughts in this region data for the hydrologic parameter i e streamflow of the study area was procured from the hydro climatic data network hcdn 2009 lins 2012 the gaging stations included new stations which are part of the gage ii dataset falcone 2011 the stations were unimpaired in other words the watersheds above the gages did not have any anthropogenic impacts data for monthly average streamflow were retrieved from the online database of usgs http www usgs gov the obtained data was monthly streamflow data i e april through june from 1962 2016 these were used to determine the seasonal spring streamflow volume which is used in the current study the data for monthly averaged winter sst from december to february of 1962 2016 i e for 55 years was obtained from the physical science division of the national oceanic and atmospheric noaa administration s earth system research laboratory esrl http www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded the included sst is the most recent dataset of its type available as noaa extended and reconstructed v5 in the aforementioned website previous researchers such as hidalgo 2004 and ellis et al 2010 have correlated variabilities of the atlantic ocean to the hydrology of the western u s this current study also incorporated the atlantic oceanic atmospheric parameters in addition to pacific variabilities the sst data were obtained for each 2 2 degree grid cell of the pacific ocean 30s to 70 n and 100e to 80 w and the atlantic ocean 30s to 70 n and 80 w to 20 w altogether there were 4581 such grids whose sst data were extracted the most recent average monthly z500 shum500 and u500 december february from 1962 2016 i e for 55 years were obtained from https www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded data ncep reanalysis derived pressure html the z500 shum500 and u500 data were obtained for each 2 5 2 5 degree grid cells of the pacific ocean and the atlantic ocean altogether there were 4018 such grids in the pacific and atlantic oceans whose z500 shum500 u500 data were extracted first the spatiotemporal teleconnections were made of various climate predictors sst z500 shum500 and u500 with the hydrologic predictands i e streamflow using svd svd analysis yielded the predictors of streamflow as a temporal expansion series tes next the tes predictors were screened based on nonparametric screening next the probabilistic forecasts were made with the screened tes finally forecasting of the streamflow was conducted using svm knn with the screened predictors all the aforementioned methods are discussed in the following sections 2 2 svd analysis bretherton et al 1992 compared various approaches utilized in relating multiple fields of climate data and found that singular valued decomposition svd is easy to implement and performs well for large time series svd was used as a robust statistical tool to detect the spatiotemporal interrelationship between a predictor i e climatic variability sst z500 shum500 and u500 and a predictand i e the hydrologic parameters of streamflow and precipitation from their cross covariance matrix sagarika et al 2015 details regarding svd can be obtained from bretherton et al 1992 the standardized sst z500 shum500 and u500 anomalies matrices along with standardized streamflow matrices were developed first before evaluating cross covariance matrices over which the svd analysis was performed the standardized climate variable matrix were of the order m t where t the number of columns was equal to the temporal dimension of the data here 55 years similarly m is equivalent to the number of grid cells the standardized streamflow matrix was of the order n t where t is the temporal dimension and the total number of streamflow stations is expressed by n the temporal dimensions of standardized sst z500 shum500 and u500 anomalies matrices along with standardized streamflow matrices were same even though they varied in size spatially svd decomposes the covariance matrix m as usvt where u and v often are the representation for the left matrix and the right matrix s is a central diagonal matrix that comprising non zero singular values eight different left matrices and eight different right matrices were obtained as a result of an independent svd analysis of each variable for both the pacific and atlantic ocean with the streamflow the singular values were organized in decreasing order the first value was termed as the first mode and so on bretherton et al 1992 sagarika et al 2015 the importance of different svd modes can be explained by the squared covariance factor scf scf is the ratio of a corresponding singular value squared to the squared sum of singular values of all the modes bretherton et al 1992 and is summarized in eq 1 1 s c f i s i 2 j 1 r s i 2 where the ith mode scf is indicated by s c f i and s i is the ith mode singular value similar to scf normalized square covariance nsc gives the idea about the correlation among the significantly teleconnected predictors and predictand for each mode it gives the idea about how well each correlated grid cells of climatic variable is linearly associated to significantly teleconnected streamflow stations mathematically nsc is the ratio between singular value squared sums and product of significantly teleconnected number of streamflow stations and grid cells of corresponding climate variables as expressed in eq 2 2 n s c c 2 n s n p where c signifies the squared singular values sum n s is the number of streamflow sites and n p is the total number of gridded data in any predictor sets after the svd results were obtained left tes of first mode were obtained projecting u matrix on standardized climate variable matrix corresponding to first mode similarly right tes of the first mode were obtained from v matrix and standardized streamflow matrix left tes and right tes together holds the consolidated information about primary modes of correlations between streamflow and climate data further left tes retains the primary modes sst z500 shum500 and u500 variability which are associated to the streamflow and which may be unique as compared to the predefined indices thus utilizing the left tes may improve the forecast at the regional scale and is also utilized by previous studies soukup et al 2009 in this study the first mode left tes for most of the predictor had an scf of more than 90 thus explaining more than 90 of the variability thus left tes for the first mode having the information about correlated indices of sst z500 shum500 and u500 was utilized for forecasting altogether svd resulted in eight left tes for all the climate variables considered 2 3 nonparametric approach for predictor screening the nonparametric algorithm adopted in the current study is based on the method to forecast the streamflow proposed by piechota et al 1998 for more details readers are about the method referred to piechota et al 1998 and soukup et al 2009 this approach yields the continuous relation among the predictand and the predictors and the approach also doesn t presume any model structure while the forecast is probabilistic and reports the forecasts at different risk level the shortcoming of this approach is that it assumes the available data to represent the entire population thus the predictor sets showing good skills with this model were selected for final predictions with svm yielding quantitative yearly forecasts as this non parametric model is computationally less complex it can handle multiple inputs in a single instant in shorter time duration as compared to svm proving it to be more convenient screening algorithm the steps involving nonparametric screening is discussed below fig 2 shows how svd and svm are coupled with nonparametric screening algorithm the nonparametric screening of the predictors is summarized in the box with dotted boundaries of fig 2 the inputs to the nonparametric model is the tes resulting from decomposition of cross covariance matrix with svd and output of the nonparametric screening is the input for svm first the probability distribution function pdf was generated for each independent predictor left tes from svd of each predictors z500 sst shum500 and u500 of both atlantic and pacific and ocean utilizing the kernel density estimator kde adopted by piechota et al 1998 to generate the pdf the streamflow and their respective predictors pi are ranked highest to lowest based on the streamflow qi values the first data point is the 6th ranked as minimum of five data points are required to obtain the pdf based on the kde kde is expressed as the following eq 3 3 f x 1 h n i 1 n k x x i h w h e r e f o r g a u s s i a n k e r n e l d e n s i t y e s t i m a t o r h i 0 9 a i h i 1 5 a i m i n σ i i n t e r q u a r t i l e r a n g e 1 34 here bandwidth of the data is h the number of data is expressed as n and k is the kernel function σ i is the standard deviation of predictor data in ith subset eight predictor s pdfs for each year s streamflow were obtained with kde once the predictor pdfs were obtained the exceedance probability curve of the streamflow were obtained from the bayes theorem for conditional probabilities as the following eq 4 4 p q i x p i f i x i 1 n p i f i x p i being the probability of occurrence of the streamflow q i based on the observed streamflow dataset f i x is the probability of the predictor x based on the pdfs p q i x is the probability of the streamflow q i for the predictor x later the exceedance probability of the forecast is generated for any given year the skill of the probabilistic exceedance forecast is evaluated with the linear error in probability space leps score the skill for the entire forecast for all years is computed with the average of leps scores sk values the mathematical representation of both leps and leps sk is presented in section 3 4 for screening the predictors the continuous exceedance probability curve of each predictor was combined by assigning random weights to each predictor and the sum of their weights were 1 the forecasts were made with a combined continuous exceedance probability curve in order to optimize the weights assigned to each predictor optimization was done by using the leps sk scores of the forecast which were higher for the better nonparametric forecasts ward and folland 1991 potts et al 1996 leps sk is further described in section 2 6 the predictors with lower weights i e less than 0 1 were rejected the combined continuous exceedance probabilistic forecasts were made again incorporating only the selected predictors and the weights were again optimized for the higher leps sk scores the process was continued until the combination of predictors for each streamflow station was obtained with the maximum leps sk score the final combination of predictors for each station was used in the svm knn 2 4 svm modelling the generalized expression for svm regression technique was abstracted from vapnik 1998 is expressed as 5 f w t φ x i b where ф xi is the input and the coefficients wt weight factor and b bias term are obtained by optimizing the risk function r f which is expressed as eq 6 6 r f c n i 1 n ξ ξ 1 2 w 2 s u b j e c t t o y i j 1 k i 1 l w j x j i b ε ξ i j 1 k i 1 l w j x j i b y i ε ξ i ξ i ξ i 0 where the cost c that is used for generating agreement between the tolerance of the prediction error and the complexity of the function the number of support vectors are denoted by k ξi and ξi which are the slack variables that are the deciding parameters that indicate the level to which the samples should be penalized for the error larger than vapanik s insensitive loss function ε the above discussed standard svm models have associated problem of model complexity to overcome this complexity issue least square svm lssvm was incorporated in the current study lssvm improves upon the standard svm by including equality constraints instead of the inequality one suykens and vandewalle 1999 suykens et al 2002 kuh 2004 the eq 6 of standard svm gets reduced in lssvm to the following eq 7 7 min j w e c 2 i 1 n e i 2 1 2 w t w s u b j e c t t o y i w t φ x i b e i w h e r e i v a r i e s f r o m 1 t o n eq 7 shows the optimization expression in which 1 2 w t w helps to adjust the weight and c 2 i 1 n e i 2 is the penalty function the error in the ith prediction of y i is e i the optimization of eq 7 is done utilizing the langrangian multipliers as shown in eq 8 below 8 f x i 1 n a i k x x i b where a i is the langrangian multiplier and k x x i is the kernel function responsible for operating the data in higher dimension feature space without finding the data coordinates in the higher dimension some of the examples of the kernel functions are linear kernel gaussian kernel radial basis kernel function rbf rbf kernel was utilized in the current study which have better skills over other kernel functions scholkopf et al 1997 kalra et al 2013 the rbf kernel on samples x and xi is expressed as the following eq 9 9 k x x i e x p x x i 2 2 σ 2 the hyper parameter σ is obtained by optimizing the error and improving the forecast in the training and testing period the hyper parameters are evaluated with grid based search twarakavi et al 2009 this removes uncertainty which estimates best combination with minimum error as in eq 3 all sets of possible hyper parameters is considered to calculate the error the reasonable feature space is generated for each sets of hyper parameter based on the possible lowest and highest values cost function ranging from 0 001 1000 and the slack variable ranging from 0 001 100 for optimizing the grid based hyper parametrization and for efficient computation the increment of 0 01 was selected and the optimization was done for the minimal mean square error this hyper parametrization results in dense clusters and also reduces the prediction uncertainty asefa et al 2006 kalra and ahmad 2012 optimizing the hyper parameter have large number of support vectors but a smooth model which does not mean overfitting validating a data driven model is crucial in determining the forecast reliability traditional data driven models are divided into training and testing period which has its own disadvantage while dealing with periodic time series as oceanic atmospheric variables manifest different types of periodicity breaking the data into training and testing periods may not reproduce comparable results for various training and testing data sets thus to control the error caused by breaking the samples into training and testing periods for support vector regression moving period svm was implemented thus reducing the model sensitivity and prediction uncertainty kalra and ahmad 2012 for more details about moving period cross validation approach readers are referred to stone 1974 and geisser 1975 instead of dividing the entire data into specific training and testing period k fold moving period algorithm is utilized with k 1 also known as leave one out technique for the time series of n years the data for one year was selected for testing while other mutually exclusive n 1 year s data were used for training purpose the process was repeated for the entire time series i e n times with mutually exclusive training period during each iteration final predictions were obtained by pooling all the predictions made by svm with all training and testing periods in order to evaluate the strength of the svm approach and to access whether multiple training and testing samples do not reproduce varying outputs the bootstrap technique was incorporated in this current study the bootstrap approach which was first developed by efron 1979 and described further by efron and tibshirani 1993 addition of bootstrap technique adds extra layer of validation to the svm model it was implemented in this study to evaluate how well the svm model results generalized while using an independent dataset svm was trained with a bootstrapped data sample and then tested on the entire measured dataset for a given dataset if the size of the dataset is n the bootstrap sample was generated by sampling n instances from the data with replacement the bootstrap resampling process was iterated to obtain 100 combinations corresponding to the measured value of each year for each station finally the average of 100 combination results was calculated as the final estimation for a reliable forecast the svm results should be consistent with and without implementation of bootstrap resampling approach 2 5 knn regression like svms another widely used regression technique is k nearest neighbor unlike conventionally used linear regression models which assumes the gaussian distribution of errors knn regression is a non parametric technique which estimates the predictand locally making it able to capture both linear and nonlinear relations between predictors and predictand grantz et al 2005 the linear regression can be expressed as the following eq 10 10 y f x 1 x 2 x 3 x 1 e where f is the function fitting the predictor indices x1 x2 x3 xp to the predictand like streamflow y with the error e assumed to be following gaussian distribution the non parametric regression like knn lall and sharma 1996 rajagopalan and lall 1999 kernel based regression piechota et al 1998 and locally weighted polynomials lwp loader 1999 on the other hand estimate f locally making them capable to model both local and global variations in the datasets the knn regression in the current research utilized the properties of both knn and lwp first the order of the polynomial and the neighborhood size are obtained based on generalized cross validation function gcv the gcv and its application is expressed in following eq 11 11 g c v k p i 1 n e i 2 n 1 m n 2 where regression error in ith data is represented as ei total data points number is represented by n and number of parameters is represented by m the nearest neighbors for each of the data point were obtained and the polynomials were fitted locally the streamflow ynew was obtained from the local fit for each ith input sets the error between ith ynew and ith y data is ei higher weight is then assigned to the nearest neighbor as compared to less near neighbor the weight for k nearest neighbor is distributed as shown in following eq 12 12 w j 1 j i 1 k 1 i for any new value of predictor say xnew ynew is predicted as mentioned above after finding the nearest neighbor and so on the error for the nearest neighbor xn is then calculated as en the error en is then summed to the forecast mean ynew en to evaluate one member of the ensemble forecast the number of neighbors adopted to generate the ensemble should may vary as compared to the number of neighbors adopted while evaluating local polynomials selection procedures for the number of nearest neighbor can be referred to rajagopalan and lall 1999 apart from other statistics the efficacy of the ensemble forecasts is evaluated by incorporating ranked probability skill score rpss rpss signifies whether the model s performance to apprehend categorical probability is better than the categorical probability of the historic data climatology for the current study the ensemble forecast and the climatological data are categorized as terciles 0 33rd percentile 34 66th percentile 67 100th percentile here the categorical probability is the proportion of the data out of the total falling in each category tercile the ranked probability score rps for the forecast and the climatology is evaluated first before evaluating the rpss eq 13 given below was utilized for calculation of rps of each year 13 r p s m 1 k i 1 m p i i 1 m d i 2 for the current study k was three as the ensemble was divided into three categories the categorical probability of the ensemble forecast for ith category pi is ratio of the number of members of ensemble forecast falling in the ith category to the total number of ensemble members the parameter di is one if the observed streamflow falls in ith category else it is zero after evaluating rps for forecast and the climatology rpss is evaluated as following eq 14 14 r p s s 1 r p s f o r e c a s t r p s c l i m a t o l o g y positive rpss suggests that the forecast is skillful as compared to the climatology while the rpss of 1 shows the perfect forecast the negative rpss signifies that the model performs worse than the climatology the rps and rpss were calculated for each year independently 2 6 assessment of forecasted streamflow reliability using statistical parameters the agreement between the observed and estimated streamflow in this study was evaluated with the correlation coefficient r percentage bias pbias and nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse all above mentioned statistical performance measures are described in moriasi et al 2007 further the cumulative non exceedance probability was estimated using leps skill sk which was used to access the forecast skill as compared to climatological mean the expression of r pbias and nse is expressed in following eqs 15 16 and 17 respectively 15 r i 1 n x i m e s x m e a n m e s x i e s t x m e a n e s t i 1 n x i m e s x m e a n m e s 2 i 1 n x i e s t x m e a n e s t 2 16 p b i a s i 1 n x i m e s x i e s t i 1 n x i m e

average observed measured streamflow and x m e a n e s t is the average forecasted estimated streamflow the correlation coefficient r signifies the linear relationship among the measured and estimated streamflow it ranges between negative and positive 1 a higher magnitude of r shows the good relationship between the two variables the streamflow forecast is said to be reliable if r is close to positive 1 signifying a low amount of errors in the forecast the percentage bias is the measure of average tendency of biasness of the estimated forecasts as compared to the actual one the optimal pbias is 0 signifying the minimum biasness of the forecast the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse is popular when assessing the predictive capabilities of the hydrologic model nash and sutcliffe 1970 nse ranges from to 1 where 1 is the best nse score signifying a perfect agreement among the estimated and observed streamflow the leps skill parameterizes the difference between the observed and estimated streamflow in terms of the cumulative probability distribution potts et al 1996 the expression for the leps score derived from potts et al 1996 is summarized in eq 18 18 s 3 1 p f p 0 p f 2 p f p 0 2 1 where p f is the cumulative probability for the forecasted streamflow and p 0 is the cumulative probability for the observed streamflow an accurate forecast far from the climatological mean will have a higher leps score and are considered to be good forecasts the average leps sk is computed with eq 19 19 s k s s m 100 where s is the total leps score for all years the leps score is the sum for the best forecast represented by s m when s is positive the cumulative probability distribution of observed and predicted streamflow are same for negative s sm is the sum of leps score for the poor forecasts the model is considered to have good performance if leps sk is greater than 10 and its value ranges from 100 to 100 potts et al 1996 3 results and discussion first the results obtained by tele connecting the predictors and predictands using svd is presented in this section and their physical significance is discussed next results of screening of the predictors based on leps score and exceedance probability curve is explained finally the svm forecast results and cross validated results are presented and discussed 3 1 svd after individual svd analysis for both river basins the sacramento and the san joaquin the variability of the streamflow gages were explained by the first modes of all the predictors with in each case scfs greater than 90 after applying the svd separately on both watersheds the correlations generated as left tes were used for further analysis the svd results which are explained in this section are shown as significant regions in figs 3 and 4 these are regions with signs regions with signs which are the regions of increasing decreasing oceanic atmospheric variabilities for the first mode of svd for the sacramento river basin fig 3a shows the 90 significance correlation map representing pacific climate variabilities and fig 4a shows the 90 significant region for the atlantic ocean s climate variabilities 90 significant regions signify that there is a 10 chance of the results to be false positive so the results have 90 confidence similarly results for the san joaquin watershed is shown in fig 3b for the pacific and fig 4b for the atlantic sst for the first mode explains most of the variability in each watershed of the study area as compared to other modes of sst the sst teleconnected regions for sacramento river basins are positively correlated which means the increase in sst in the teleconnected regions with sign results in the increase in seasonal flow and vice versa the increase in z500 shum500 and u500 in the teleconnected regions in figs 3a and 4 a with sign results in the decrease in streamflow in sacramento river basin and vice versa as these regions are negatively correlated with the streamflow similarly sst z500 and u500 teleconnected regions of pacific ocean shown in fig 3b are positively correlated with the streamflow of san joaquin river basin the increase in these regions result in the increase decrease in streamflow of san joaquin river basin respectively on the other hand shum500 teleconnected regions shown in fig 3b are negatively correlated with the streamflow the z500 region below alaska was out of phase with the streamflow stations for both the sacramento and san joaquin watersheds in other words these regions had negative correlations to the streamflow this shows a connection to variability in the aleutian low al lower than average pressures in the al region signify an increase in the frequency or intensity of storm tracks moving across the pacific ocean toward north america this in turn leads to increased precipitation along the pacific northwest of the u s down to the sacramento and san joaquin watersheds furthermore the close contours of z500 signify a rapid change of geopotential index levels which can be taken as the origin of the polar jet streams the polar jet streams play a key role in the advection of moisture to the west coast of the u s from the pacific ocean physically a higher shum500 in the alaskan gulf signifies a greater amount of dec feb precipitation in the u s pacific northwest suggesting the effect of jet stream that reduces the precipitation and runoff in the ssj river basin the lower shum500 in the california region resulting in lower streamflow signifies less dec feb winter precipitation and low apr jun runoff u500 teleconnected regions shown in figs 3a and b are similar to the pattern of the jet stream moving to the western coast of the u s through the pacific this signifies that the moisture that gets transformed to streamflow in the region is driven by the jet stream in addition to the westerlies the trough of the jet stream shifts eastwards and westwards in the pacific during various phases of enso thus the jet stream sometimes has a higher probability of passing through the ssj watershed resulting in higher than normal precipitation and runoff in other instances the jet stream moves storm tracks along the alaskan and canadian coasts and passes through the northwestern u s above california this increases the precipitation and streamflow in the northwestern u s but lowers the amount of runoff and precipitation in california the standardized left tes for the first mode climate variables of sst and z500 along with shum500 and u500 of both pacific ocean and atlantic ocean obtained from the svd analysis are summarized in fig 5 column a of fig 3 represents the left tes for sacramento watershed while the ltes results for san joaquin river basin is shown in column b the solid line in fig 5 represents the left tes corresponding to the pacific ocean and the one corresponding to the atlantic ocean is represented by dotted lines table 1 summarizes the scf and nsc values expressed in percentage corresponding to all predictors of ssj watershed as seen in the figure scfs are mostly greater than 90 showing that the first mode of teleconnections captured most of the teleconnections between the streamflow and the climate variables similarly nsc is 100 for the perfect correlation which signifies 100 correlation among all streamflow values and the predictor values for each grid 100 nsc is impractical to anticipate while the nsc values tabulated in the table 1 is comparable to the previous studies for the current study the nscs ranged from1 5 to 3 5 while pathak et al 2018 evaluated the nscs ranging from 1 78 to 3 87 for western us snowpack similarly sagarika et al 2015 evaluated the correlation coefficient ranging from 0 009 to 0 64 for western us apr jun streamflow 3 2 nonparametric screening svd results show that the first mode scfs are highly significant more than any other modes in terms of explaining the variability of the streamflow thus taking into account the first mode left tes s for all oceanic atmospheric variables could prove to be a skillful predictor for the streamflow stations under consideration further based on the exceedance results i e the leps skill for the models the best combination of predictors for each station were evaluated in addition they can be used to make probabilistic forecasts by using a continuous exceedance probability curve as shown in fig 6 additionally a good model should be able to forecast the flow more accurately than can the climatology 1981 2010 to evaluate the model skill relative to the climatology 1981 2010 leps skill was evaluated the leps sk above 20 is categorized as good forecast as shown in fig 6 similarly as shown in the fig 6 the leps sk between 10 and 20 is categorized as fair forecast and the leps sk less than 10 is categorized as poor forecast fig 6 shows the exceedance probability forecasts for station 1 for 2013 2016 and 2015 which were the good fair and poor forecast years respectively the forecast year 2013 for station 1 was a good year because at a 50 exceedance level i e 50 risk the forecast shown as solid line in fig 6 lies close to the observed streamflow volume shown as a circle in fig 6 as compared to the climatology shown as the dotted line with leps skill scores 24 56 on the other hand there are risks in predicting the flow in a poor forecast year such as 2015 for station 1 as shown in fig 6 however the model behaves well and is comparable to the climatology at 50 exceedance level for even these years although the model had associated errors by averaging the entire period of 54 years the model was skillful with the leps score approaching 10 thus the models with highest leps scores were selected and their predictors were used for further svm modeling the best combination of the predictors were the first mode left tes of shum500 pacific and u500 pacific for streamflow stations 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 yielding the maximum leps score similarly shum500 pacific shum500 atlantic and u500 pacific were found to be the best predictors for site 1 which had an optimum leps score based on the weight for different predictors of the best model for each station shum500 and u500 of pacific were more skillful for the streamflow forecast of the ssj watershed previously sst was widely used by various researchers to predict the precipitation and streamflow uvo et al 1998 westra and sharma 2010 in addition z500 was widely used for the same purpose serreze et al 1998 the current study identified that one month lagged winter variability of pacific shum500 and pacific u500 proved to be more effective in predicting the april to june streamflow of ssj watershed compared to sst and z500 although individual svd analysis with each variables resulted in the teleconnected regions but shum500 and u500 were skillful predictor for the streamflow based on the non parametric screening which can be explained physically the apr jun streamflow in ssj watershed is driven primarily by the winter dec feb snow precipitation within the region furthermore winter snow precipitation highly depends upon the pacific shum500 and u500 both shum500 and u500 variabilities corresponds to the moisture circulation from the pacific toward western united states during the winter months shum500 captures the amount of moisture circulated from the pacific similarly u500 provides the information about jet streams which drives the moist air rising from the pacific ocean towards the western united states 3 3 svm the results of svm in fig 7 a shows the time series plots for individual streamflow stations of the ssj river basin the statistical parameters i e r pbias and nse for the forecasted streamflow with svm are presented in fig 7b fig 7c shows the distribution of measured and estimated streamflow and fig 7d represents the leps sk of the forecast bootstrap cross validation result of the svm model is presented in fig 8 the unit of streamflow represented as normal is the percentage of the average measured observed streamflow the time series plots in fig 7a incorporate the measured observed streamflow and svm estimates estimated streamflow as the normal of the mean observed flow of the streamflow at each gage stations in fig 7a dashed lines show measured and the solid lines show the svm estimated streamflow the time series plots indicate that the current approach was able to predict most of the high flows and low flows although some events were missed the magnitudes of error were not very high the model was good at predicting most of the low flows as well as sustained low flows the capability of capturing sustained low flows makes the model effective for water managers for sustainable flow management in drought affected regions a robust harmony between the observed and the predicted values was observed from the time series plots according to moriasi et al 2007 the simulated model was considered to have very good performance in terms of pbias which was less than 10 for each streamflow stations of the ssj watershed the current model had a minimum r of 0 87 ranging to 0 96 the model was assumed to have a very good performance rating as r was greater than 0 85 this indicates that the correlation coefficient ranks the model as a very good one for ssj watershed nse ranged between 0 73 and 0 82 further moriasi et al 2007 ranked the model as a very good one if nse ranged in between 0 75 and 1 which was mostly true for this hybrid model thus based on nse r and pbias the hybrid model was reliable with very good performance these statistical parameters are well described in moriasi et al 2007 further moriasi et al 2007 established model evaluation guidelines based on the range of these parameters these parameters showed that the model forecasted results in good correlation with the observed values the scatterplots in fig 7b represent good agreement among the measured and estimated streamflow volumes for the ssj river basins respectively as in all scatterplots the major number points were aligned and were close to the 45 bisector line the flow volume for spring april to june is presented as the normal of the mean observed streamflow from the scatterplot this can be visualized that the model forecast is in agreement to the observed streamflow using boxplots fig 7c compare the measured and estimated spring streamflow for the ssj watershed for most of the stations the model was able to apprehend low flows as compared to the high flows as can be seen from the box plots the 5th percentile of the estimated flow resembled that of the measured flow the model ability to capture the low flow makes it useful for the water managers working on drought affective the accuracy of the svm forecast relative to the climatological mean was evaluated as the cumulative non exceedance probability error which was calculated and evaluated as the leps sk score the probabilistic cumulative error among measured and estimated streamflow is shown in fig 7d for the ssj river basin according to potts et al 1996 the outcome is said to be random if sk 0 and the model is said to perform well if sk 10 in this study the sk 60 for all stations with a minimum of 62 9 and a maximum of 80 4 from fig 7d nearly 80 of the predictions for site 6 had 10 error thus the performance of the model was better for station 6 in the sacramento watershed as compared to other stations of ssj watershed these leps sk scores ascertained the robustness of the model as a forecasting tool for water managers as the model skill was better than when using climatology techniques fig 8 shows the time series plots for measured estimated and cross validated streamflow values for the study period for each station of the ssj watershed again good agreement among the measured predicted and bootstrapped time series was observed the bootstrapped cross validation outcome reaffirms the robustness of the svm model the results of the model were stable and did not vary with changes in the training and testing datasets the bootstrapped results showed agreement with the estimated time series following a similar trend as that of the estimated time series plots after screening the predictors and using them to forecast using svm it was observed that the model performance was acceptable based on the accessed statistical skills as evident from the time series plots the cross validated and estimated flows were similar to the observed streamflow the model performed well as the estimated flow followed the 45 bisector line indicating the good fit results the overall model performance was acceptable as the predictions were associated with low errors there was good agreement to the measured flow although sometimes that was difficult to capture during such events as the high flows of sacramento in 2005 and 2006 based on the evaluations of model performance against climatology 1981 2010 using leps skill scores the model predictor seemed to serve well in forecasting the streamflow as compared to climatology this indicates that the model performance worked adequately well for ssj watershed especially when capturing the low flows as evident from the time series plots the model s ability to capture sustained low flows may prove to be a promising resource for water managers especially in regions facing prolonged droughts such as the western u s the performed svm regression incorporated primary modes of four different types of largescale climate variables to improve the streamflow at the regional scale in the ssj river basin of the drought affect northern california the skill of the forecast based on all the presented statistical evaluations were within the acceptable limits larger correlation coefficients and larger nse accompanied with smaller pbias confirms the model accuracy higher skills of svm can be attributed to both preprocessing the large scale climate variables with svd and the non parametric screening of the svd teleconnections to establish the hypothesis that the use of large scale climate variable have improved the forecast skill forecast were also made with predefined indices for the evaluation of the proposed approach which is presented below the robustness of the proposed approach of utilizing the primary modes of large scale teleconnections for streamflow forecasting is further reaffirmed with the streamflow forecast results based on the predefined indices as shown in fig 9 fig 9 shows streamflow forecasts with three combinations pacific ocean s predefined indices niño 3 4 pdo and niño 3 4 pdo corresponding to site 5 where niño 3 4 an enso index ranging from 120th to 170th west longitudes on both sides of equator by 5 degrees the first column of fig 9 shows the time series of the forecast utilizing niño 3 4 predefined index along with the scatter plots box plots and non exceedance probability curve similarly second and third column of fig 9 shows the results of streamflow forecast utilizing pdo index and both pdo and niño 3 4 respectively the forecast with niño 3 4 and pdo indices but the proposed approach of utilizing the primary modes of large scale teleconnections results had better statistical skills the maximum nse as shown in fig 9b for site 5 was 0 66 while the nse utilizing the large scale climate variable was 0 73 as shown in fig 7b similarly the correlation coefficient between the measured and observed streamflow volume forecasted with large scale climate variable was 0 87 which was higher than the maximum correlation coefficient of 0 82 for the forecast obtained utilizing the predefined indices similarly the leps sk of the model utilizing the predefined indices for site 5 as shown in fig 7d is less as compared to the leps sk for site 5 shown in fig 7d corresponding to the forecast with large scale climate variable 3 4 knn after svm regression the rationale to include knn was to establish the confidence that the teleconnections of the regional streamflow values with the large scale climate variables are skillful in any regression other than svm the knn forecast of the ssj river basin is presented in fig 10 as the boxplot representing the medians quartiles and the outliers with 100 forecasts for each year at each station the figures also include the time series plots of the observed streamflow to compare the ensemble forecast with the observed streamflow values all streamflow in fig 10 are presented as the normal of the mean observed streamflow at each gage stations from fig 10 it is evident that observed measured streamflow lies within the boxes of the ensemble forecasts suggesting good model performance capable of capturing most of the flows including high flows and low flows in the interquartile range the ability of knn model to capture the streamflow peaks showed the effectiveness of the coupled svd and non parametric screening algorithm the predictors evaluated with coupled svd and non parametric screening were able to capture the streamflow variabilities asymmetry of the boxes around the median shows the skewness of the forecast captured due to resampling of the data the quantitative evaluation of the knn is performed with rpss correlation coefficient r percentage bias pbias and nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse the parameters r pbias and nse are calculated with the mean of the ensemble forecast evaluating the mean ensemble forecast the aforementioned parameters are tabulated in the table 2 the simulated knn model was considered to have very good performance in terms of pbias which was less than 10 for each streamflow stations of the ssj watershed the current model had a minimum r of 0 83 ranging to 0 90 the model was assumed to have a very good performance rating as r was greater than 0 85 except for one station this indicates that the correlation coefficient ranks the model as a very good one for ssj watershed nse ranged between 0 67 and 0 79 further moriasi et al 2007 ranked the model as a good one if nse ranged in between 0 65 and 0 75 and very good for the stations with nse ranged in between 0 75 and 1 the rpss presented in the table is the median value of the 55 years rpss obtained for each streamflow stations the positive rpss indicates the ensemble forecast having better skill than climatology further the rpss closer to 1 signifies more skillful forecast similar to the svm model knn was also capable to capture the variations in the streamflow like high flows and the low flows as seen in the fig 10 where the peaks of the observed time series lies within the box plots of the ensemble forecasts further it was also able to capture the sustained low flows making the model useful in drought prone regions forecasting the streamflow with climate indices can result in errors in the forecast because of the inability of climate indices to capture every underlying physical process to overcome this the use of largescale climate variable teleconnections with the regional streamflow can lead to better inclusion of regional climate systems further to improve the model results extensive care was taken while choosing the largescale climate predictors based on the regional geography climate processes the climate variables utilized were skillful in capturing local climate features affecting the streamflow the approach is purely statistical and it can perform well at the regional scales but the underlying physical drivers of the streamflow cannot be fully understood while the advantage of using the statistical model is that it is easy to implement and these models are not prone to parameter uncertainty future studies can be done in other regions with the clear overview of different sets of climate variables effecting the streamflow within the region in the current approach both svm and knn were able to capture the extreme hydrological extremes with minor deviation between the forecast and the observed streamflow overall the both model s forecast were skillful during the stud period and can lead to in making month ahead seasonal water management strategies 4 conclusions in this study a new approach to forecast seasonal streamflow volume was developed as an improvement to those developed in previous researches in order to improve streamflow forecast with predefined indices this study utilized teleconnections obtained from svd analysis to predict streamflow volume in conjunction with nonparametric screening and the nonlinear regression model like svm and knn the first advantage of the adopted framework was that it subsides the use of predefined indices with the aid of svd the second advantage was utilizing the non parametric approach to screen the svd relations this lead to segregate the skillful svd relations that would enhance the input of the regression model finally using the svm and knn as a regression tool established the robustness of the forecast four different oceanic atmospheric variables sst and z500 along with shum500 and u500 over the pacific ocean and atlantic ocean were utilized to improve the streamflow forecast at the regional scale the first research question was addressed with the help of svd analysis by finding the new teleconnected regions corresponding toshum500 and u500 in addition to sst and z500over pacific and atlantic oceans for the ssj watershed streamflow the second research question was addressed with the non parametric screening showing that the shum500 and u500 of pacific were the best predictors for the streamflow of ssj watershed the proposed forecasting approach utilizing the large scale climate variables were skillful based on the statistical evaluations the proposed forecast approach were more reliable than streamflow forecasts performed using the predefined indices in the selected study area this was the answer for the final research question as the forecasts is truly based on the statistical principles the physical processes involved in the variations of streamflow cannot be understood the forecasts made by data driven models improve with increase in the training period the current study incorporated 55 years of available streamflow data the training period of the current model could be improved in future by including reconstruction data in addition to the instrumental records forecasts for different lead times also could be evaluated in the future to determine the lead time at which the model performs the best in a selected study area finally using this proposed method in different regions with different types of datasets may lead to a better understanding of the implications of the model the current research is important for season ahead prediction of streamflow values in the ssj watersheds a major cropland of california with the teleconnected parameters of the pacific and atlantic oceans the study used standard global datasets along with the standard statistical tools for this research the seasonal forecast volume obtained from the proposed forecast approach was reliable as the robustness of the forecast was established with the bootstrap cross validation technique the results were verified using different measures for statistical performance this study might be beneficial to the water
