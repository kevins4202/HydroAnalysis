2220,decentralized aquifer recharge programs are an alternative to centralized stormwater aquifer recharge systems and can improve groundwater tables in urban areas in a decentralized aquifer recharge program households and property owners collect and store rainwater from rooftops and replenish aquifers through small gravity fed recharge wells this research presents a micro trading rainwater for aquifer recharge mrar system as a decentralized peer to peer water market that can recharge groundwater resources through a decentralized water market households act as prosumers who collect and sell rainwater to consumer households and convey traded water via a shared aquifer this research develops an agent based modeling framework as an approach to evaluate the performance of a mrar system to replenish groundwater resources and reduce energy required to pump water agents represent 1 prosumers that collect rainwater sell rainwater to consumers and replenish the groundwater system through dry wells and 2 consumers that exert irrigation demands buy rainwater from prosumers and pump water from the groundwater system the agent based model is coupled with a groundwater flow model to evaluate the effects of micro trading on groundwater resources the agent based modeling framework is applied for a virtual city to assess the performance of a mrar system for scenarios that vary in the ratio of consumers to prosumers location of prosumers and consumers and aquifer properties model outcomes demonstrate the optimal ratio of consumers to prosumers based on the volume of traded water improvements in groundwater head and improvements in unit energy of water findings demonstrate that the optimal ratio of consumers to prosumers is consistent across different values for hydraulic conductivity the location of prosumer and consumer households affects the unit energy of water and has a negligible effect on the groundwater table and total energy consumed to pump water

request 1 introduction urbanization that accompanies population growth and economic development can deplete groundwater resources and contribute to water insecurity buildings parking lots and roadways increase impervious land cover reducing infiltration that would replenish groundwater systems dhakal and chevalier 2016 alam et al 2021 growing populations in urban areas lead to inflated water demands which are often met through infrastructure development such as increased groundwater pumping sankarasubramanian et al 2017 the effects of groundwater overuse and reductions in infiltration can lead to depleted water tables in urban areas one approach to improve urban groundwater resources is to use stormwater to recharge aquifers dillon et al 2019 alam et al 2021 stormwater can be collected and allowed to infiltrate into an aquifer using small dammed reservoirs alataway and el alfy 2019 or pumped into a groundwater system through recharge wells hussain et al 2019 gado and el agha 2020 stormwater recharge has been explored for water sensitive locations including cape town south africa mauck and winter 2021 the canary islands spain marazuela et al 2022 and los angeles california usa luthy et al 2019 centralized programs for stormwater recharge can be inefficient as they require high value urban land investment in grey infrastructure energy for pumping and coordinated governance stormwater recharge can also pose a risk to public health because stormwater is typically contaminated with chemical and microbial agents and injecting stormwater through pumping wells can spread contaminant quickly over a wide area u s environmental protection agency 2021 new paradigms of decentralized water management can conserve and protect environmental resources by restoring the natural hydrologic cycle and reducing the need for large infrastructure investments and energy inputs sharma et al 2010 dhakal and chevalier 2016 leigh and lee 2019 decentralized aquifer recharge programs are emerging as an alternative approach to replenish groundwater resources bekele et al 2018 decentralized aquifer recharge programs allow households and property owners to collect rainwater from rooftops and recharge a shared aquifer through small dry wells which are vertical perforated pipes that release gravity fed water into the vadose zone edwards et al 2016 2022 for example the million wells for bengaluru campaign was implemented to increase the groundwater table in the city by motivating neighborhoods businesses and households to dig and maintain one million small recharge wells that use gravity fed rainwater to replenish the aquifer urbanwaters 2018 research that explores rainwater harvesting for aquifer recharge has focused on individual isolated systems through assessing the effects of subsurface properties on infiltration rates sasidharan et al 2018 2019 2020 2021 modeling a singular well to simulate storage rainfall dynamics and groundwater flows russo et al 2022 and monitoring a pilot program that deployed rainwater harvesting for aquifer recharge at one building on a university campus wang et al 2015 few studies have explored how large scale decentralized aquifer recharge programs can be expected to perform nachshon et al 2016 calculated the volume of water that could be collected through rainwater harvesting to recharge groundwater in tel aviv israel but did not assess expected changes in water table levels islam and talukdar 2016 developed an optimization model to explore tradeoffs in water supply and groundwater resources for an aquifer recharge program that uses rainwater harvested from the rooftops of nearby buildings the study considered a small hypothetical area and a limited number of recharge wells while components of decentralized aquifer recharge programs have been explored in the existing body of research further studies are needed to characterize performance based on water savings aquifer recharge and water quality for a range of site specific conditions decentralized paradigms for water supply reward participants for conserving water through reduced water bills decentralized water systems can enable and incentivize additional water conservation through local peer to peer distribution of water sharma et al 2010 leigh and lee 2019 schmack et al 2019 through a decentralized water market water consumers can act as prosumers who take a proactive approach to manage their consumption production storage and distribution of excess water sousa et al 2019 similar to large scale water rights markets that enable water trading among municipal and agricultural users garrick et al 2013 decentralized water markets allow households to trade water and create additional incentives to reward environmentally friendly behavior as prosumers can sell excess water to peers a few examples of decentralized water markets have been explored in research a micro trading market was proposed to explore the water savings associated with a cap and trade water rights program for residential end users haddad 2000 a proof of concept model was developed to simulate micro trading of virtual water as water rights among households using smart meters blockchain and smart contracts alcarria et al 2018 another modeling study explored a system in which households contribute stormwater and greywater to a shared groundwater resource through garden bores fornarelli et al 2019 households act as prosumers and gain credits in water use accounts and a shallow aquifer conveys water from households to the water utility a smart water grid was envisioned by ramsey et al 2020 in which households micro trade harvested rainwater prosumers collect rainwater and sell it to consumers and traded water is conveyed via a dual reticulated network or reclaimed water network prosumers pump water into the pipe network and consumers withdraw water from the network for non potable purposes ramsey et al 2020 developed a simulation framework to assess the hydraulic feasibility of the smart water grid while the smart water grid generates energy and water savings it relies on a centralized non potable water distribution network which is an expensive infrastructure investment new research is needed to explore decentralized markets that use a shallow aquifer instead of a pipe network to transmit traded water this research proposes and explores a new decentralized water market by integrating water micro trading within a decentralized aquifer recharge system in a micro trading rainwater for aquifer recharge mrar system rainwater is harvested by prosumer agents and sold to consumer agents who apply purchased water to meet outdoor irrigation demands an aquifer acts as the conveyance system and serves as an environmental buffer that can naturally clean harvested rainwater prosumers contribute rainwater through gravity fed infiltration wells and consumers pump traded water through garden bores or backyard wells in contrast to the smart water grid ramsey et al 2020 the mrar system does not require infrastructure investment beyond drilling shallow wells this research tests the mrar system by developing an agent based modeling abm framework which simulates consumers and prosumers as agents that trade water consumers are modeled as agents that withdraw water to irrigate lawns and prosumers are modeled as agents that recharge a shared aquifer the abm is coupled with a groundwater flow model to assess the effects of household level actions and interactions on aquifer levels the modeling framework is applied for a virtual case study and water consumption aquifer head and energy consumption are evaluated for scenarios that explore varying ratios of consumers to prosumers aquifer properties and location of consumer and prosumer households results demonstrate the feasibility of a decentralized micro trading system to generate water and energy savings and recharge urban aquifers 2 agent based modeling framework this research develops an abm framework to evaluate the performance of a mrar system abm is an approach to simulate the behaviors and micro interactions of a population of autonomous and heterogenous agents and explore the emergence of macro level phenomena holland 1995 2000 abm has been applied to explore the interactions of human decisions with water systems by representing water users stakeholders and decision makers as agents berglund 2015 a range of frameworks couple groundwater modeling and abm to simulate the effect of stakeholder water use behaviors on groundwater resources castilla rho 2017 ohab yazdi and ahmadi 2018 al amin et al 2018 garcia et al 2019 abm has also been applied to simulate peer to peer markets by modeling households as agents that buy and sell energy in a residential smart energy grid monroe et al 2020 and water in a smart water grid ramsey et al 2020 in a decentralized water market the ability of agents to trade resources is an emergent and complex outcome of weather dynamics the demand exerted by consumer agents the supply that is stored by prosumer agents and the market that matches buyers and sellers abm provides an approach to capture the discrete simulation of micro trading events and subsequent changes in prosumer water supply and consumer water demand as they interact with the hydrologic system the modeling framework presented in this research couples an abm with a groundwater flow model to simulate the dynamics of climate demand rainwater harvesting and storage and groundwater resources fig 1 an economic market is not simulated in this framework instead this research focuses on the hydrologic processes to evaluate the upper bounds on water conservation and energy conservation that could be expected for a mrar system the abm and groundwater flow models are loosely coupled the abm is first executed for the entire simulation timeline and the complete set of outputs from the abm are used as input for the groundwater model which is executed sequentially the abm is described following the overview design and details odd protocol grimm et al 2006 2 1 overview 2 1 1 purpose the purpose of the abm is to simulate rainwater micro trading among consumer and prosumer agents in an aquifer system to evaluate the volume of traded water improvement in groundwater tables and energy consumption required for pumping groundwater 2 1 2 entities state variables and scales each agent represents an individual consumer or prosumer household that is assigned a pumping or dry well respectively consumer agents exert demands and in this formulation prosumer agents supply water and do not exert demands prosumer agents harvest rainwater and sell harvested rainwater to consumer agents once rainwater is purchased prosumer agents recharge the traded volume of water to the aquifer consumer agents buy water from prosumer agents and meet any shortfalls in supply through groundwater consumer agents pump both traded rainwater and groundwater from the aquifer to completely satisfy their irrigation demands consumer demand and prosumer supply are modeled as abstraction and recharge respectively at corresponding wells within the groundwater simulation model the parameters required to calculate consumer demands and prosumer supply are listed in table 1 both prosumers and consumers are assigned geographic coordinates that remain static throughout the simulation state variables which are updated dynamically are listed in table 2 for each consumer daily irrigation demand is updated at the beginning of each calendar month based on precipitation evapotranspiration and lawn area for each prosumer tank storage is updated due to precipitation flushing requirements and infiltration to the aquifer the model operates on a daily time step over a 21 year horizon 2 1 3 process overview and scheduling the model executes on a daily time step t e beginning at the start of the calendar year prosumers harvest rainwater and enter the groundwater market synchronously consumers update their daily irrigation demand synchronously decide whether to irrigate synchronously and enter the groundwater market asynchronously step 1 occurs once each calendar month steps 2 7 occur on a daily time step and steps 8 and 9 occur at the end of the simulation steps 1 6 and step 9 are described in detail as submodels in the supplemental material step 8 which executes the groundwater simulation is described further in section 3 the model is executed to simulate trades for a total of t daily time steps by applying the following steps step 1 consumer agents calculate daily irrigation demand at the beginning of each calendar month consumer agents update their daily demand for the month for example at t e 1 corresponding to january 1 consumer agents calculate and update their irrigation demands based on precipitation and monthly evapotranspiration step 2 update time of rainfall the model stores the time step of the most recent rainfall event step 3 prosumer agents collect rainwater each prosumer updates water storage as a function of precipitation roof area rainwater tank capacity and first flush volume step 4 consumer agents decide to irrigate if no precipitation fell in the previous time step each consumer agent exerts daily irrigation demand as calculated in step 1 step 5 agents trade rainwater prosumer agents with available supply and consumer agents with unmet irrigation demand are randomly paired consumers purchase the volume of water required to meet their demand or all water that is available from the paired prosumer consumers continue to iterate through prosumers with available water until they satisfy their need or all available water is consumed step 6 agents calculate groundwater recharge and withdrawal prosumer agents record the volume of traded water that will be used to recharge the aquifer consumer agents meet any shortfall in their total irrigation demand through groundwater consumer agents record their irrigation demand as the volume of water that will be pumped from the aquifer step 7 increase time step if the simulation time is reached e g t e t go to step 8 otherwise go to step 1 step 8 execute groundwater flow simulation model the data set of irrigation demands and recharge are used as input for the groundwater flow simulation model which reports the aquifer head at each cell and time step step 9 consumer agents consume energy consumer agents consume energy to pump groundwater out of the aquifer the amount of energy expended is a function of the volume of irrigation demand ground surface elevation and the aquifer head prosumers use gravity fed recharge wells and do not consume energy 2 2 design concepts 2 2 1 decision making agents make decisions using simple heuristics consumer agents irrigate their lawns based on previous rainfall and evapotranspiration consumer agents do not use information about the amount of available water or cost associated with purchasing water to select a prosumer agent for micro trading prosumers are reactive agents and release water when matched with consumer agents 2 2 2 stochasticity household agents are initialized deterministically at locations across the aquifer however household agents are randomly assigned as consumer or prosumer agents these randomized locations can affect model outcomes when conducting trades consumer agents randomly select prosumer agents with available water supply to purchase water consumer agents continue to trade with prosumer agents until they satisfy their demands or until there is no rainwater storage remaining in the system as a result stochasticity in micro trading does not affect the total volume of water that is purchased or the location of pumping volumes on the other hand the location and volume of rainwater infiltration is affected by stochasticity in micro trading 2 2 3 sensing consumer agents and prosumer agents have no prior knowledge of other agents irrigation demand or available supply until they agree to trade once they enter into a trade agreement consumer agents know the exact volume of water available from the prosumer and prosumer agents know the exact consumer demand both consumer and prosumer agents have exact information about precipitation depths to calculate demand and supply and consumers have exact information of evapotranspiration 2 2 4 interaction consumer and prosumer agents interact directly to meet demands with available supply consumer agents only interact directly with prosumer agents and prosumer agents interact directly only with consumer agents trades are unconstrained by spatial location and any prosumer agent with available water supply can trade with any consumer agent with an irrigation demand 2 3 details initialization input and implementation at the start of the simulation agents are initialized as prosumer or consumer agents and all rainwater harvesting tanks are empty once prosumer agents collect rainwater they flush tanks before beginning trades the abm requires daily precipitation data and monthly evapotranspiration data as input parameter values used to initialize the abm for the case study are specified in table 1 the abm is implemented using the mesa package which is a python based discrete event multi agent simulation library kazil et al 2020 3 groundwater flow simulation the groundwater flow model is written in python in the flopy package bakker et al 2016 flopy allows for the development and integration of modflow models with other python based scripts in this research flopy was used to develop a modflow 2005 model of a simple unconfined aquifer the aquifer s specific yield s y and horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity k x y and k z respectively remain constant across all cells each household agent is assigned a well in the center of a cell and only one agent may occupy each cell consumer demands are represented as negative pumping rates at corresponding wells and prosumer supply is represented as a positive pumping rate these pumping rates are used as input to the well wel package to generate a set of daily stress periods for the duration of the model simulation for example a year long simulation would consist of a set of 365 one day stress periods daily recharge is calculated as a fixed percentage of the daily precipitation rate and used as input to the recharge rch package precipitation and recharge are assumed as uniform across the aquifer the direct solver de4 package is used to solve the finite difference equations for each stress period the budget discrepancy limit is set at 1 0 to allow solver flexibility in determining a solution 4 virtual case study wolfpack city the abm framework was applied to simulate a mrar system for a virtual community wolfpack city wolfpack city was originally developed as a virtual non potable water distribution network to simulate a smart water grid ramsey et al 2020 in this application wolfpack city was reconfigured to represent a community of 2016 households that rely on groundwater to meet residential irrigation requirements agents were clustered around a population center in the northeast corner of the aquifer and assigned elevations between 9 1 and 58 7 m above a datum corresponding with the locations and elevations in the original wolfpack city water distribution network fig 2 it was assumed that each household receives potable water to meet high quality end uses via a separate potable water system that is not modeled in this framework simulations for wolfpack city are specifically for lawn irrigation supply and demand while wolfpack city is a virtual case study this research assumed that it is located near seattle washington usa to use real world precipitation data and aquifer characteristics seattle was selected as a location because of it has a high potential for rainwater harvesting yield based on analysis described by ramsey et al 2020 4 1 local climate data daily precipitation data collected at renton municipal airport weather bureau army navy identifier 94248 located at 47 29 34 8 n 122 12 51 84 w were used to execute the simulation for a 21 year period from january 1 2000 to december 31 2020 midwestern regional climate center 2022 the average annual precipitation over the 21 years of simulation was 77 2 cm fig 3 monthly evapotranspiration rates were collected from the global land data assimilation system gldas noah land surface model v 2 1 gldas noah v 2 1 rodell et al 2004 to calculate consumer demand equation s2 data for household density roof area and the ratio of unpaved land to total land area were collected seattle s household density ρ was reported as 721 housing units km 2 values for roof size and ratio of unpaved land to total land area were determined using national averages table 1 united states geological service 2020 nahb 2010 using equation s2 the consumer irrigable lawn area l i was calculated as 494 9 m2 for agents in wolfpack city 4 2 hydrologic data and design agents in wolfpack city recharge and withdraw from wolfpack aquifer a shallow unconfined aquifer wolfpack aquifer was developed using hydrological parameters from the puget sound aquifer which underlies seattle the puget sound aquifer primarily consists of alluvial glacial and interglacial sediments from the quaternary age these glacial tills vary widely in grain size which creates a range of hydraulic conductivity and specific yield values horizontal hydraulic conductivity k x y in the puget sound aquifer ranges between 6 1e 5 to 16 1 m day vaccaro et al 1998 the wolfpack aquifer k x y value was set at 4 5 m day vertical hydraulic conductivity values k z for glacial till are one to two orders of magnitude smaller than k x y vaccaro et al 1998 a value of 0 005 m day was used for k z and 25 for specific yield consistent with previous studies in the puget sound aquifer vaccaro et al 1998 recharge in the puget sound aquifer ranges between 0 to 178 cm yr with an average recharge rate of 69 cm yr which is 51 of the annual precipitation in the region vaccaro et al 1998 this study assumed a conservative daily recharge rate equal to 20 of daily precipitation values the modflow representation of wolfpack aquifer was developed with one layer 148 rows and 82 columns the 12 136 cells were assigned uniform width and length of 30 5 m 100 ft agents were located at the center of the corresponding grid cell and only one agent occupied a grid cell boundary conditions were set within the basic bas package the eastern and western boundaries had constant heads of 0 0 and 3 0 m 0 0 and 10 0 ft respectively the southern boundary of the aquifer was set as a no flow boundary with a depth of 12 2 m 40 0 ft below the datum the northern boundary of the aquifer was set at 6 1 m 20 0 ft above the datum the depth to the water table ranged from 3 0 m at the lowest elevation to 39 6 m at the highest elevation in the study area 5 modeling scenarios and sensitivity analysis a set of scenarios was developed to explore the impact of micro trading on the groundwater table the base case scenarios simulate a varying number of households that join the market as consumers the participation of households as consumers ranged from 0 to 100 of the total number of households in increments of 10 for example in the base case 20 consumer scenario bc 20 20 of agents are consumers and 80 of agents are prosumers the locations of all agents were initialized prior to the simulation and household agents were randomly assigned as consumer or prosumer agents the assignment of consumer status remained consistent among base case scenarios for example if agent a located at grid cell i j was assigned as a consumer in the bc 70 scenario agent a remained at cell i j and behaved as a consumer for all base case scenarios with a consumer ratio 70 bc 70 bc 80 bc 90 and bc 100 each base case scenario was simulated for a 21 year horizon using mesa and flopy which required approximately 47 7 min per simulation using a 2 80 ghz 11th gen intel r core tm i7 11657 sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the effect of hydrologic parameters and the location of consumer and prosumer agents on model outcomes nine base case scenarios were used to conduct sensitivity analyses bc 10 bc 20 bc 30 bc 40 bc 50 bc 60 bc 70 bc 80 and bc 90 scenarios bc 0 and bc 100 assigned all agents as prosumers or consumers respectively and were not included in sensitivity analysis because there was no micro trading in these scenarios the effect of hydraulic conductivity was explored by initializing the model with four values for horizontal hydraulic conductivity k x y each setting was simulated for nine base case scenarios a second set of analyses explored the effect of consumer and prosumer location a set of 30 simulations were executed for nine base case scenarios a total of 270 simulations with randomly generated realizations of the placement of consumers and prosumers the performance of simulations was measured by assessing changes in aquifer head and the energy expended by consumer agents to pump groundwater 6 results 6 1 example scenario bc 70 base case scenario 70 bc 70 initialized 70 of agents 1 412 of 2016 agents as consumers and 30 604 agents as prosumers irrigation demand was highest in the summer months june august and significantly exceeded water supply prosumers harvested rainwater and sold it almost immediately to few consumer agents shown for the first year of simulation in fig 4 the precipitation decreased over the 21 year period fig 3 leading to increasing demands and a decreasing volume of supply to meet demand the total volume of traded water was reported as 201 2 ml or 8 6 of the total irrigation demand 2342 4 ml most of the irrigation demand was met through groundwater resources rather than harvested rainwater the maximum supply was calculated as the total volume of rainwater that was runoff from prosumer rooftops over the 21 year period to represent the maximum volume of water that could be traded the maximum supply was calculated as 456 ml only 44 of the maximum supply 201 2 ml was traded to meet demands although the total volume of demands exceeded the volume of maximum supply one reason for this is that approximately 50 of precipitation 38 4 cm per year fell during the late fall and winter months november to february consumer agents did not exert irrigation demand during winter months however and rainwater harvested by prosumers was wasted and not sold on the market the volume of traded water was not based on a simple comparison of supply and demand instead the volume of traded water emerged based on the timing of supply and demands in response to precipitation and evapotranspiration dynamics and the discrete mechanisms of rainwater harvesting tanks the mean head in the aquifer decreased by 0 6 m from 4 4 to 3 9 m over the simulated time horizon for bc 70 fig 5 due to decreasing levels of precipitation and the effects of irrigation withdraws higher levels of precipitation increased groundwater heads due to the effects of both increasing aquifer recharge and decreasing irrigation demand for example the head increased by 0 3 m between november and december 2006 4 5 to 4 8 m the wettest month of the simulation 29 5 cm lower levels of precipitation decreased recharge and increased irrigation demand the aquifer head decreased by 0 36 m between 2018 and 2020 corresponding to the driest period of the simulation annual precipitation of 50 49 and 44 cm for 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively quadrant ii beneath the population center fig 2 experienced the largest head change during the simulation declining 1 1 m over the 21 year time horizon figure s1 a declining groundwater table led to higher energy consumption required to pump water from a lower depth in the aquifer the unit energy of water or the amount of energy required to pump a unit volume of water demonstrated the effect of withdrawing groundwater on the cost of groundwater as shown in fig 5 the unit energy increased with a decreasing mean head following both seasonal and annual patterns the unit energy increased from an annual average of 102 2 kwh ml in 2000 to 105 5 kwh ml in 2020 3 2 increase the effect of increasing unit energy on overall energy consumption was negligible however and the total energy consumption was driven by the volume of water withdrawn for irrigation figure s2 6 2 performance analysis across all base case scenarios the mrar system was simulated for 11 base case scenarios ranging from 0 to 100 consumers the locations of agents with prosumer or consumer behaviors were controlled and remained similar between scenarios as described above scenarios were evaluated based on the volume of traded water impacts to the groundwater table and energy consumption at low percentages of consumers the maximum supply exceeded the total demand and consumers were able to meet a significant proportion of their demand through trades fig 6a scenario bc 10 reported the highest percentage of demand met through trades at 82 fig 6b the highest volume of traded water was reported for scenario bc 30 at 344 ml of traded water fig 6a scenarios bc 20 and bc 40 report similar performance at more than 330 ml of traded water for scenario bc 30 the volume of traded water was 32 of the maximum supply produced through runoff from prosumer roofs the percentage peaks at 49 for scenario bc 90 fig 6b these results demonstrate that though the supply is much greater than the demand for some scenarios the dynamics of supply and demand drive the total volume of traded water aquifer head monotonically decreased with additional consumers fig 7a due to the increasing total demands exerted for each scenario each bc scenario was simulated without micro trading where consumers withdrew water for irrigation but prosumers did not recharge the aquifer with rainwater the improvement in groundwater tables due to micro trading was evaluated at each time step as the difference in the groundwater table between with micro trading and without micro trading relative to the groundwater table without micro trading the effect of micro trading resulted in marginally higher groundwater tables fig 7b and improvements were non linear improvements in the groundwater table increased monotonically for scenarios bc 90 to bc 30 scenarios bc 30 and bc 20 reported similar performance with an average improvement of 0 67 and 0 66 respectively over the last five years 2016 2021 the performance for scenario bc 10 dropped to an average improvement of 0 55 over the last five years which was inferior to the performance for scenario bc 50 the unit energy of water for bc scenarios increased with increasing numbers of consumers fig 8 due to the decreasing elevation of the groundwater table unit energy was sensitive to the elevation of consumer agents as consumer agents at high elevations required more energy to pump water from the aquifer raising the average unit energy of water the unit energy peaked at bc 60 which is the peak of the average elevation of consumer agents the peak in average elevation is an artifact of the randomized distribution of consumer agents during model initialization the unit energy of water was also calculated for each bc scenario without micro trading fig 8 and the difference between unit energy for bc scenarios with micro trading and without micro trading was reported as the savings in unit energy inset in fig 8 micro trading generated only small energy savings when compared to the same scenarios without micro trading due to marginal reductions in depletion of the groundwater table the greatest difference in unit energy was reported for the bc 30 scenario which also reported the highest volume of traded rainwater and the greatest improvement to the groundwater table as described above for each of the metrics traded water groundwater heads and savings in unit energy the bc 20 and bc 40 scenarios performed similarly to the bc 30 scenario the abm approach facilitates new insight to the non linear improvement in unit energy and groundwater tables that emerged with micro trading at different ratios of consumers to prosumers these results can be used to provide guidance in developing micro trading for the wolfpack mrar the optimal ratio of consumer to prosumers is in the range of 1 5 to 2 5 7 sensitivity analysis 7 1 hydraulic conductivity to evaluate the impacts of hydraulic parameters on the model the bc scenarios were executed for varying k x y and k z values settings for k x y originally set at 4 5 m day were specified at 3 0 6 0 46 and 457 m day the ratio of k x y to k z was maintained at 0 001 for all values of k x y consistent with the relationship exhibited in glacial till vaccaro et al 1998 the hydraulic conductivity settings created a range of dynamics for the aquifer head results are shown for quadrant ii in fig 9 low conductivity values created a high head at initialization however pumping reduced the groundwater head at a faster rate when compared with high conductivity values for example the mean head in quadrant ii for k x y 4 5 m day with 100 consumers fell below the head in an aquifer with k x y 6 0 m day and 0 consumers at the end of the simulation high values for hydraulic conductivity resulted in aquifer dynamics that did not respond to changes in withdrawals and there was little difference in the head across all bc scenarios for k x y 457 m day the hydraulic conductivity scenarios were executed with and without micro trading to evaluate the impacts of hydraulic conductivity on energy consumption changes in the aquifer head had a marginal effect on energy consumption micro trading generated small reductions in unit energy for all values of hydraulic conductivity except for k x y 457 m day which did not show any reduction in unit energy due to micro trading fig 10 low values of k x y allowed higher changes in the head of the aquifer associated with pumping when compared to high values of k x y though the energy required increased for higher values of hydraulic conductivity the most efficient allocation of consumer and prosumer agents remained consistent for each setting for hydraulic conductivity the highest energy savings were generated for scenario bc 30 with similar performance for bc 20 and bc 40 in choosing locations where mrar systems would be most efficient aquifers with low hydraulic conductivity can generate higher energy savings and result in improved aquifer heads 7 2 location of consumer and prosumer agents to test the sensitivity of the performance of the mrar system to the distribution of consumer and prosumer agents across the topography nine base case scenarios bc 10 through bc 90 were run 30 times with randomly assigned consumer and prosumer behaviors the location of consumer and prosumer agents did not change the volume of traded water and the distribution of agent behaviors across the aquifer had a marginal impact on the head in the aquifer the maximum difference among the 30 random simulations based on the mean head at the final time step of the simulation 21 years was reported for the bc 30 scenario for this scenario the difference in head between the simulation that reports the minimum energy consumption and the simulation that reports the maximum energy consumption was 0 3 cm which represents less than a 1 difference in the elevation of the groundwater table while bc 30 was reported above as the most efficient ratio of consumers to prosumers it was also the scenario that was most affected by the location of consumers and prosumers energy was in turn affected by the location of agents as the elevation of individual agents affects energy required for pumping the mean energy consumption mwh annual per capital energy consumption kwh consumer agent year and unit energy of water kwh ml across 30 simulations for each bc scenario are reported in the supplemental material table s1 the total energy consumption increased nearly linearly at a rate of approximately 34 6 mwh for each 10 increase in consumers fig 11a the standard deviation of total energy use was an order of magnitude lower however and the total energy consumption in the model was not sensitive to changes in the location of consumer and prosumer agents fig 11a instead the primary drivers of energy consumption were the number of consumers and the volume of water consumed the location of consumers and prosumers had a more noticeable effect on unit energy fig 11b the standard deviation of unit energy across 30 random simulations was high for low percentages of consumers indicating that unit energy was influenced by the distribution of agent behaviors 8 discussion this study tested the hydraulic performance of a smart water grid for micro trading harvested rainwater through a peer to peer water market that allows residential households to harvest sell and buy rainwater conveying traded water through shallow groundwater aquifer the ratio of consumers to prosumers significantly impacts the efficiency of micro trading programs and the abm framework provides an approach to assess these effects simulations that were conducted for the bc scenarios found that a ratio of consumers to prosumers that is set at 3 7 or 30 consumers leads to the most efficient market based on volume of traded water groundwater improvements and savings in unit energy and the performance for 20 and 40 consumers was similarly high hydraulic conductivity was varied to test the effects of aquifer properties on market outcomes results showed that the most efficient settings remained at 30 consumers based on savings in unit energy regardless of the hydraulic conductivity the effect of the market in improving groundwater tables and unit energy was greatest for lower values of hydraulic conductivity or aquifers where groundwater is not transmitted as easily sensitivity analysis tested the effects of the location of consumer and prosumer agents by initializing consumer and prosumer assignments randomly results demonstrated that stochasticity in agent behavior assignment created a negligible effect on groundwater head and total energy consumed the location of consumer and prosumer agents affect the emergent unit energy required to pump water and for very low participation of consumers e g 10 there was a wider variation in unit energy attention should be paid to the location of consumer households for systems with low participation in the market in summary the mrar supplied a substantial proportion of irrigation water demand for low ratios of consumers to prosumers but the effects of micro trading on improving the groundwater table and energy consumption are small in magnitude further research should explore how these effects would scale in dense urban areas previous research explored the performance of a similar micro trading program a smart water grid that uses a dual reticulated network as the infrastructure for conveying traded rainwater ramsey et al 2020 a micro trading market that uses pipe infrastructure to transmit traded water has several limitations first the smart water grid relies on a centralized non potable water distribution network which limits its applicability beyond communities that can afford the investment needed to construct a second pipe network parallel to the drinking water system second the smart water grid was not developed with on site water treatment processes for rainwater which raises concerns about water quality within the system finally the smart water grid requires sellers to expend significant energy to pump rainwater into the network which may discourage seller participation in the network using a shallow aquifer instead of a pipe network to transmit traded water generates several benefits a mrar system eliminates the reliance of consumers and prosumers on a centralized network for some non potable water demands reduces water quality issues via groundwater percolation and reduces the entry costs for prosumers to participate in the network the mrar system because it allows groundwater based trades may provide a more practical system for facilitating micro trading but further research is needed to address remaining limitations areas of further research are described as follows 8 1 water quality water quality is a significant concern for managed aquifer recharge programs and stormwater that percolates through a groundwater system may not be considered fit for potable purposes dillon et al 2019 the mrar that is demonstrated in this research assumes that consumers use extracted groundwater for irrigation purposes only and prosumers remove the first flush of rainwater to safeguard water quality prosumer agents recharge using rainwater which would have higher water quality than stormwater and gravity fed dry wells are typically drilled to an elevation that is above the water table providing flow pathways that can purify water as it infiltrates further research is needed to characterize the fate and transport of water quality constituents in the vadose zone when harvested rainwater is gravity fed through dry wells and additional water treatment may be required to satisfy stakeholder expectations or water quality regulations for groundwater systems research that characterizes water quality parameters within a mrar system is necessary to ensure that unnecessary health risks are mitigated 8 2 smart technologies micro trading programs rely heavily on smart and connected technologies to rapidly sense and communicate demands and facilitate microtransactions the mrar system as envisioned in this research relies on smart sensors actuators blockchain and smart contracts advanced metering infrastructure and smart water meters collect accurate high resolution water consumption data to enable accurate micro trading and actuators are needed to automatically pump or release water once a trade is conducted blockchain acts as a distributed secure ledger to enable digital transactions without requiring involvement of a trusted third party organization nakamoto 2008 smart contracts work as simple scripts encoded on the blockchain to settle financial transactions between buyers and sellers christidis and devetsikiotis 2016 the mrar system would be a cyberphysical system that tightly integrates physical infrastructure and information and communications technology ict smart technologies are not explicitly modeled in the framework described in this manuscript and further research is needed to explore the hardware and software components that should be integrated with physical infrastructure to enable micro trading relying on smart technologies to facilitate decentralized peer to peer markets can have unintended effects on the delivery of resources new research is needed to explore and mitigate any impacts that micro trading may have on the privacy and security of households equitable provision and quality of water resources and energy consumption of smart technologies 8 3 human behaviors public perceptions participation and water consumption a mrar system can be affected by uncertainty in human behaviors as households interact with peers and with the hydrologic system the framework presented here uses a monthly theoretical outdoor water demand model which may overestimate or simplify the amount of water consumed for irrigation refined methods for estimating irrigation are needed to improve the accuracy of the modeled demands in the formulation presented here prosumer agents do not exert irrigation demands the formulation can be readily updated to allow prosumers to use water to irrigate onsite before micro trading water it is expected that allowing prosumers to consume rainwater would decrease the effectiveness of the market and lead to a decrease in the optimal ratio of consumer to prosumer agents an increase in the required number of prosumers climate drives the volume of water that is required for irrigation and the volume of rainwater that is collected and the framework can be applied to test the efficiency of the mrar system for climate change scenarios and locations with varying precipitation patterns water treatment applied at the point of use or at infiltration sites can be used to expand the array of end uses met through trading and potentially improve the efficiency of the mrar by meeting larger volumes of demands additional uncertainty should be resolved in water use and water generation as new end uses and water sources are incorporated this research simulated a simple exchange between households where consumers and prosumers were randomly matched and consumers were matched with additional prosumers until their demands were satisfied or no rainwater storage remained in the system further research is needed to capture the effects of a realistic economic market for example an abm was developed to study a residential electricity micro trading market and a bilateral market was simulated to match consumer and prosumer agents based on willingness to pay and willingness to accept monroe et al 2020 a bilateral market can be simulated for a mrar system using data about the cost of water and alternative water sources research has shown that non potable water is perceived as an inferior substitute for potable water in irrigation and considerable cost savings may be needed to incentivize consumers to use non potable water for irrigation lee et al 2021 it is expected that the reduced value of non potable water and transaction costs involved in a market would lead to losses in the efficiency of a mrar system the research conducted here while it does not consider the realities of an economic market can be considered as an upper bound on the performance of a mrar system to improve groundwater tables and conserve water resources finally new research is needed to explore the expected participation in a micro trading system social norms and value driven attitudes are the most significant predictors of acceptance of stormwater reuse mankad et al 2019 a survey of attitudes around stormwater reuse found significantly higher acceptance of stormwater treated via managed aquifer recharge for non drinking purposes when compared with drinking purposes mankad et al 2019 other surveys have shown that water scarcity increases stakeholder acceptance of water trading markets keenan et al 1999 rahimova et al 2016 quesnel and ajami 2017 and water reuse garcia cuerva et al 2016 smart technologies that automate micro trading can reduce transaction costs but may create high barriers to entry as a result of these perceptions significant efforts may be needed to reach critical levels of adoption that can substantially conserve groundwater resources educational campaigns may be required as part of a mrar system to encourage widespread adoption and onsite treatment options may be needed to overcome perceptions further research can explore cluster solutions where a small number of households contribute rainwater to a shared well as households may be more likely to participate if they are not required to drill and maintain a well onsite a larger number of households would lead to the need for additional infrastructure to store large volumes of rainwater convey rainwater to a shared well or inject rainwater into the groundwater through pumping further research should explore tradeoffs between infrastructure costs and participation rates for varying levels of decentralization 9 conclusions this study simulated and tested the performance of a mrar system which is a decentralized peer to peer rainwater micro trading network that relies on an unconfined aquifer to convey traded water in a mrar system residential households capture and trade rainwater within a network of participating households purchasing agents pump all water for irrigation needs out of the aquifer and selling agents recharge the groundwater table with harvested rainwater once it has been purchased this research explored the impact of the allocation of consumers and prosumers hydraulic conductivity and the location of consumers and prosumers on water savings aquifer levels and energy consumption for the scenarios considered in this research energy savings and the volume of traded water were highest when 20 40 of participants were consumers and these results were consistent across aquifer properties tested in this research the location of consumer and prosumers across an aquifer affects variability in the unit energy of water but has only a marginal effect on groundwater head and total energy consumed future research is needed to explore the integration of smart technologies the fate and transport of water quality constituents and the effect of public perceptions and economic behaviors on the performance of a mrar system there is a growing interest in using decentralized infrastructure to provide urban services historically the built environment provides engineering services through centralized facilities to optimize efficiency through economies of scale the centralized approach to infrastructure design has been criticized however due to high environmental emissions high energy consumption and vulnerability to disasters sharma et al 2010 leigh and lee 2019 schmack et al 2019 there has been an emerging interest in providing engineering services through decentralized infrastructure which can save energy and water reduce infrastructure costs increase resiliency and provide equitable access to services a micro trading system builds on the advantages introduced through decentralized services by giving community members increased agency over their water use and water conservation decisions urban water managers can use the mrar system developed in this research to construct decentralized water

2220,decentralized aquifer recharge programs are an alternative to centralized stormwater aquifer recharge systems and can improve groundwater tables in urban areas in a decentralized aquifer recharge program households and property owners collect and store rainwater from rooftops and replenish aquifers through small gravity fed recharge wells this research presents a micro trading rainwater for aquifer recharge mrar system as a decentralized peer to peer water market that can recharge groundwater resources through a decentralized water market households act as prosumers who collect and sell rainwater to consumer households and convey traded water via a shared aquifer this research develops an agent based modeling framework as an approach to evaluate the performance of a mrar system to replenish groundwater resources and reduce energy required to pump water agents represent 1 prosumers that collect rainwater sell rainwater to consumers and replenish the groundwater system through dry wells and 2 consumers that exert irrigation demands buy rainwater from prosumers and pump water from the groundwater system the agent based model is coupled with a groundwater flow model to evaluate the effects of micro trading on groundwater resources the agent based modeling framework is applied for a virtual city to assess the performance of a mrar system for scenarios that vary in the ratio of consumers to prosumers location of prosumers and consumers and aquifer properties model outcomes demonstrate the optimal ratio of consumers to prosumers based on the volume of traded water improvements in groundwater head and improvements in unit energy of water findings demonstrate that the optimal ratio of consumers to prosumers is consistent across different values for hydraulic conductivity the location of prosumer and consumer households affects the unit energy of water and has a negligible effect on the groundwater table and total energy consumed to pump water

increase impervious land cover reducing infiltration that would replenish groundwater systems dhakal and chevalier 2016 alam et al 2021 growing populations in urban areas lead to inflated water demands which are often met through infrastructure development such as increased groundwater pumping sankarasubramanian et al 2017 the effects of groundwater overuse and reductions in infiltration can lead to depleted water tables in urban areas one approach to improve urban groundwater resources is to use stormwater to recharge aquifers dillon et al 2019 alam et al 2021 stormwater can be collected and allowed to infiltrate into an aquifer using small dammed reservoirs alataway and el alfy 2019 or pumped into a groundwater system through recharge wells hussain et al 2019 gado and el agha 2020 stormwater recharge has been explored for water sensitive locations including cape town south africa mauck and winter 2021 the canary islands spain marazuela et al 2022 and los angeles california usa luthy et al 2019 centralized programs for stormwater recharge can be inefficient as they require high value urban land investment in grey infrastructure energy for pumping and coordinated governance stormwater recharge can also pose a risk to public health because stormwater is typically contaminated with chemical and microbial agents and injecting stormwater through pumping wells can spread contaminant quickly over a wide area u s environmental protection agency 2021 new paradigms of decentralized water management can conserve and protect environmental resources by restoring the natural hydrologic cycle and reducing the need for large infrastructure investments and energy inputs sharma et al 2010 dhakal and chevalier 2016 leigh and lee 2019 decentralized aquifer recharge programs are emerging as an alternative approach to replenish groundwater resources bekele et al 2018 decentralized aquifer recharge programs allow households and property owners to collect rainwater from rooftops and recharge a shared aquifer through small dry wells which are vertical perforated pipes that release gravity fed water into the vadose zone edwards et al 2016 2022 for example the million wells for bengaluru campaign was implemented to increase the groundwater table in the city by motivating neighborhoods businesses and households to dig and maintain one million small recharge wells that use gravity fed rainwater to replenish the aquifer urbanwaters 2018 research that explores rainwater harvesting for aquifer recharge has focused on individual isolated systems through assessing the effects of subsurface properties on infiltration rates sasidharan et al 2018 2019 2020 2021 modeling a singular well to simulate storage rainfall dynamics and groundwater flows russo et al 2022 and monitoring a pilot program that deployed rainwater harvesting for aquifer recharge at one building on a university campus wang et al 2015 few studies have explored how large scale decentralized aquifer recharge programs can be expected to perform nachshon et al 2016 calculated the volume of water that could be collected through rainwater harvesting to recharge groundwater in tel aviv israel but did not assess expected changes in water table levels islam and talukdar 2016 developed an optimization model to explore tradeoffs in water supply and groundwater resources for an aquifer recharge program that uses rainwater harvested from the rooftops of nearby buildings the study considered a small hypothetical area and a limited number of recharge wells while components of decentralized aquifer recharge programs have been explored in the existing body of research further studies are needed to characterize performance based on water savings aquifer recharge and water quality for a range of site specific conditions decentralized paradigms for water supply reward participants for conserving water through reduced water bills decentralized water systems can enable and incentivize additional water conservation through local peer to peer distribution of water sharma et al 2010 leigh and lee 2019 schmack et al 2019 through a decentralized water market water consumers can act as prosumers who take a proactive approach to manage their consumption production storage and distribution of excess water sousa et al 2019 similar to large scale water rights markets that enable water trading among municipal and agricultural users garrick et al 2013 decentralized water markets allow households to trade water and create additional incentives to reward environmentally friendly behavior as prosumers can sell excess water to peers a few examples of decentralized water markets have been explored in research a micro trading market was proposed to explore the water savings associated with a cap and trade water rights program for residential end users haddad 2000 a proof of concept model was developed to simulate micro trading of virtual water as water rights among households using smart meters blockchain and smart contracts alcarria et al 2018 another modeling study explored a system in which households contribute stormwater and greywater to a shared groundwater resource through garden bores fornarelli et al 2019 households act as prosumers and gain credits in water use accounts and a shallow aquifer conveys water from households to the water utility a smart water grid was envisioned by ramsey et al 2020 in which households micro trade harvested rainwater prosumers collect rainwater and sell it to consumers and traded water is conveyed via a dual reticulated network or reclaimed water network prosumers pump water into the pipe network and consumers withdraw water from the network for non potable purposes ramsey et al 2020 developed a simulation framework to assess the hydraulic feasibility of the smart water grid while the smart water grid generates energy and water savings it relies on a centralized non potable water distribution network which is an expensive infrastructure investment new research is needed to explore decentralized markets that use a shallow aquifer instead of a pipe network to transmit traded water this research proposes and explores a new decentralized water market by integrating water micro trading within a decentralized aquifer recharge system in a micro trading rainwater for aquifer recharge mrar system rainwater is harvested by prosumer agents and sold to consumer agents who apply purchased water to meet outdoor irrigation demands an aquifer acts as the conveyance system and serves as an environmental buffer that can naturally clean harvested rainwater prosumers contribute rainwater through gravity fed infiltration wells and consumers pump traded water through garden bores or backyard wells in contrast to the smart water grid ramsey et al 2020 the mrar system does not require infrastructure investment beyond drilling shallow wells this research tests the mrar system by developing an agent based modeling abm framework which simulates consumers and prosumers as agents that trade water consumers are modeled as agents that withdraw water to irrigate lawns and prosumers are modeled as agents that recharge a shared aquifer the abm is coupled with a groundwater flow model to assess the effects of household level actions and interactions on aquifer levels the modeling framework is applied for a virtual case study and water consumption aquifer head and energy consumption are evaluated for scenarios that explore varying ratios of consumers to prosumers aquifer properties and location of consumer and prosumer households results demonstrate the feasibility of a decentralized micro trading system to generate water and energy savings and recharge urban aquifers 2 agent based modeling framework this research develops an abm framework to evaluate the performance of a mrar system abm is an approach to simulate the behaviors and micro interactions of a population of autonomous and heterogenous agents and explore the emergence of macro level phenomena holland 1995 2000 abm has been applied to explore the interactions of human decisions with water systems by representing water users stakeholders and decision makers as agents berglund 2015 a range of frameworks couple groundwater modeling and abm to simulate the effect of stakeholder water use behaviors on groundwater resources castilla rho 2017 ohab yazdi and ahmadi 2018 al amin et al 2018 garcia et al 2019 abm has also been applied to simulate peer to peer markets by modeling households as agents that buy and sell energy in a residential smart energy grid monroe et al 2020 and water in a smart water grid ramsey et al 2020 in a decentralized water market the ability of agents to trade resources is an emergent and complex outcome of weather dynamics the demand exerted by consumer agents the supply that is stored by prosumer agents and the market that matches buyers and sellers abm provides an approach to capture the discrete simulation of micro trading events and subsequent changes in prosumer water supply and consumer water demand as they interact with the hydrologic system the modeling framework presented in this research couples an abm with a groundwater flow model to simulate the dynamics of climate demand rainwater harvesting and storage and groundwater resources fig 1 an economic market is not simulated in this framework instead this research focuses on the hydrologic processes to evaluate the upper bounds on water conservation and energy conservation that could be expected for a mrar system the abm and groundwater flow models are loosely coupled the abm is first executed for the entire simulation timeline and the complete set of outputs from the abm are used as input for the groundwater model which is executed sequentially the abm is described following the overview design and details odd protocol grimm et al 2006 2 1 overview 2 1 1 purpose the purpose of the abm is to simulate rainwater micro trading among consumer and prosumer agents in an aquifer system to evaluate the volume of traded water improvement in groundwater tables and energy consumption required for pumping groundwater 2 1 2 entities state variables and scales each agent represents an individual consumer or prosumer household that is assigned a pumping or dry well respectively consumer agents exert demands and in this formulation prosumer agents supply water and do not exert demands prosumer agents harvest rainwater and sell harvested rainwater to consumer agents once rainwater is purchased prosumer agents recharge the traded volume of water to the aquifer consumer agents buy water from prosumer agents and meet any shortfalls in supply through groundwater consumer agents pump both traded rainwater and groundwater from the aquifer to completely satisfy their irrigation demands consumer demand and prosumer supply are modeled as abstraction and recharge respectively at corresponding wells within the groundwater simulation model the parameters required to calculate consumer demands and prosumer supply are listed in table 1 both prosumers and consumers are assigned geographic coordinates that remain static throughout the simulation state variables which are updated dynamically are listed in table 2 for each consumer daily irrigation demand is updated at the beginning of each calendar month based on precipitation evapotranspiration and lawn area for each prosumer tank storage is updated due to precipitation flushing requirements and infiltration to the aquifer the model operates on a daily time step over a 21 year horizon 2 1 3 process overview and scheduling the model executes on a daily time step t e beginning at the start of the calendar year prosumers harvest rainwater and enter the groundwater market synchronously consumers update their daily irrigation demand synchronously decide whether to irrigate synchronously and enter the groundwater market asynchronously step 1 occurs once each calendar month steps 2 7 occur on a daily time step and steps 8 and 9 occur at the end of the simulation steps 1 6 and step 9 are described in detail as submodels in the supplemental material step 8 which executes the groundwater simulation is described further in section 3 the model is executed to simulate trades for a total of t daily time steps by applying the following steps step 1 consumer agents calculate daily irrigation demand at the beginning of each calendar month consumer agents update their daily demand for the month for example at t e 1 corresponding to january 1 consumer agents calculate and update their irrigation demands based on precipitation and monthly evapotranspiration step 2 update time of rainfall the model stores the time step of the most recent rainfall event step 3 prosumer agents collect rainwater each prosumer updates water storage as a function of precipitation roof area rainwater tank capacity and first flush volume step 4 consumer agents decide to irrigate if no precipitation fell in the previous time step each consumer agent exerts daily irrigation demand as calculated in step 1 step 5 agents trade rainwater prosumer agents with available supply and consumer agents with unmet irrigation demand are randomly paired consumers purchase the volume of water required to meet their demand or all water that is available from the paired prosumer consumers continue to iterate through prosumers with available water until they satisfy their need or all available water is consumed step 6 agents calculate groundwater recharge and withdrawal prosumer agents record the volume of traded water that will be used to recharge the aquifer consumer agents meet any shortfall in their total irrigation demand through groundwater consumer agents record their irrigation demand as the volume of water that will be pumped from the aquifer step 7 increase time step if the simulation time is reached e g t e t go to step 8 otherwise go to step 1 step 8 execute groundwater flow simulation model the data set of irrigation demands and recharge are used as input for the groundwater flow simulation model which reports the aquifer head at each cell and time step step 9 consumer agents consume energy consumer agents consume energy to pump groundwater out of the aquifer the amount of energy expended is a function of the volume of irrigation demand ground surface elevation and the aquifer head prosumers use gravity fed recharge wells and do not consume energy 2 2 design concepts 2 2 1 decision making agents make decisions using simple heuristics consumer agents irrigate their lawns based on previous rainfall and evapotranspiration consumer agents do not use information about the amount of available water or cost associated with purchasing water to select a prosumer agent for micro trading prosumers are reactive agents and release water when matched with consumer agents 2 2 2 stochasticity household agents are initialized deterministically at locations across the aquifer however household agents are randomly assigned as consumer or prosumer agents these randomized locations can affect model outcomes when conducting trades consumer agents randomly select prosumer agents with available water supply to purchase water consumer agents continue to trade with prosumer agents until they satisfy their demands or until there is no rainwater storage remaining in the system as a result stochasticity in micro trading does not affect the total volume of water that is purchased or the location of pumping volumes on the other hand the location and volume of rainwater infiltration is affected by stochasticity in micro trading 2 2 3 sensing consumer agents and prosumer agents have no prior knowledge of other agents irrigation demand or available supply until they agree to trade once they enter into a trade agreement consumer agents know the exact volume of water available from the prosumer and prosumer agents know the exact consumer demand both consumer and prosumer agents have exact information about precipitation depths to calculate demand and supply and consumers have exact information of evapotranspiration 2 2 4 interaction consumer and prosumer agents interact directly to meet demands with available supply consumer agents only interact directly with prosumer agents and prosumer agents interact directly only with consumer agents trades are unconstrained by spatial location and any prosumer agent with available water supply can trade with any consumer agent with an irrigation demand 2 3 details initialization input and implementation at the start of the simulation agents are initialized as prosumer or consumer agents and all rainwater harvesting tanks are empty once prosumer agents collect rainwater they flush tanks before beginning trades the abm requires daily precipitation data and monthly evapotranspiration data as input parameter values used to initialize the abm for the case study are specified in table 1 the abm is implemented using the mesa package which is a python based discrete event multi agent simulation library kazil et al 2020 3 groundwater flow simulation the groundwater flow model is written in python in the flopy package bakker et al 2016 flopy allows for the development and integration of modflow models with other python based scripts in this research flopy was used to develop a modflow 2005 model of a simple unconfined aquifer the aquifer s specific yield s y and horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity k x y and k z respectively remain constant across all cells each household agent is assigned a well in the center of a cell and only one agent may occupy each cell consumer demands are represented as negative pumping rates at corresponding wells and prosumer supply is represented as a positive pumping rate these pumping rates are used as input to the well wel package to generate a set of daily stress periods for the duration of the model simulation for example a year long simulation would consist of a set of 365 one day stress periods daily recharge is calculated as a fixed percentage of the daily precipitation rate and used as input to the recharge rch package precipitation and recharge are assumed as uniform across the aquifer the direct solver de4 package is used to solve the finite difference equations for each stress period the budget discrepancy limit is set at 1 0 to allow solver flexibility in determining a solution 4 virtual case study wolfpack city the abm framework was applied to simulate a mrar system for a virtual community wolfpack city wolfpack city was originally developed as a virtual non potable water distribution network to simulate a smart water grid ramsey et al 2020 in this application wolfpack city was reconfigured to represent a community of 2016 households that rely on groundwater to meet residential irrigation requirements agents were clustered around a population center in the northeast corner of the aquifer and assigned elevations between 9 1 and 58 7 m above a datum corresponding with the locations and elevations in the original wolfpack city water distribution network fig 2 it was assumed that each household receives potable water to meet high quality end uses via a separate potable water system that is not modeled in this framework simulations for wolfpack city are specifically for lawn irrigation supply and demand while wolfpack city is a virtual case study this research assumed that it is located near seattle washington usa to use real world precipitation data and aquifer characteristics seattle was selected as a location because of it has a high potential for rainwater harvesting yield based on analysis described by ramsey et al 2020 4 1 local climate data daily precipitation data collected at renton municipal airport weather bureau army navy identifier 94248 located at 47 29 34 8 n 122 12 51 84 w were used to execute the simulation for a 21 year period from january 1 2000 to december 31 2020 midwestern regional climate center 2022 the average annual precipitation over the 21 years of simulation was 77 2 cm fig 3 monthly evapotranspiration rates were collected from the global land data assimilation system gldas noah land surface model v 2 1 gldas noah v 2 1 rodell et al 2004 to calculate consumer demand equation s2 data for household density roof area and the ratio of unpaved land to total land area were collected seattle s household density ρ was reported as 721 housing units km 2 values for roof size and ratio of unpaved land to total land area were determined using national averages table 1 united states geological service 2020 nahb 2010 using equation s2 the consumer irrigable lawn area l i was calculated as 494 9 m2 for agents in wolfpack city 4 2 hydrologic data and design agents in wolfpack city recharge and withdraw from wolfpack aquifer a shallow unconfined aquifer wolfpack aquifer was developed using hydrological parameters from the puget sound aquifer which underlies seattle the puget sound aquifer primarily consists of alluvial glacial and interglacial sediments from the quaternary age these glacial tills vary widely in grain size which creates a range of hydraulic conductivity and specific yield values horizontal hydraulic conductivity k x y in the puget sound aquifer ranges between 6 1e 5 to 16 1 m day vaccaro et al 1998 the wolfpack aquifer k x y value was set at 4 5 m day vertical hydraulic conductivity values k z for glacial till are one to two orders of magnitude smaller than k x y vaccaro et al 1998 a value of 0 005 m day was used for k z and 25 for specific yield consistent with previous studies in the puget sound aquifer vaccaro et al 1998 recharge in the puget sound aquifer ranges between 0 to 178 cm yr with an average recharge rate of 69 cm yr which is 51 of the annual precipitation in the region vaccaro et al 1998 this study assumed a conservative daily recharge rate equal to 20 of daily precipitation values the modflow representation of wolfpack aquifer was developed with one layer 148 rows and 82 columns the 12 136 cells were assigned uniform width and length of 30 5 m 100 ft agents were located at the center of the corresponding grid cell and only one agent occupied a grid cell boundary conditions were set within the basic bas package the eastern and western boundaries had constant heads of 0 0 and 3 0 m 0 0 and 10 0 ft respectively the southern boundary of the aquifer was set as a no flow boundary with a depth of 12 2 m 40 0 ft below the datum the northern boundary of the aquifer was set at 6 1 m 20 0 ft above the datum the depth to the water table ranged from 3 0 m at the lowest elevation to 39 6 m at the highest elevation in the study area 5 modeling scenarios and sensitivity analysis a set of scenarios was developed to explore the impact of micro trading on the groundwater table the base case scenarios simulate a varying number of households that join the market as consumers the participation of households as consumers ranged from 0 to 100 of the total number of households in increments of 10 for example in the base case 20 consumer scenario bc 20 20 of agents are consumers and 80 of agents are prosumers the locations of all agents were initialized prior to the simulation and household agents were randomly assigned as consumer or prosumer agents the assignment of consumer status remained consistent among base case scenarios for example if agent a located at grid cell i j was assigned as a consumer in the bc 70 scenario agent a remained at cell i j and behaved as a consumer for all base case scenarios with a consumer ratio 70 bc 70 bc 80 bc 90 and bc 100 each base case scenario was simulated for a 21 year horizon using mesa and flopy which required approximately 47 7 min per simulation using a 2 80 ghz 11th gen intel r core tm i7 11657 sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the effect of hydrologic parameters and the location of consumer and prosumer agents on model outcomes nine base case scenarios were used to conduct sensitivity analyses bc 10 bc 20 bc 30 bc 40 bc 50 bc 60 bc 70 bc 80 and bc 90 scenarios bc 0 and bc 100 assigned all agents as prosumers or consumers respectively and were not included in sensitivity analysis because there was no micro trading in these scenarios the effect of hydraulic conductivity was explored by initializing the model with four values for horizontal hydraulic conductivity k x y each setting was simulated for nine base case scenarios a second set of analyses explored the effect of consumer and prosumer location a set of 30 simulations were executed for nine base case scenarios a total of 270 simulations with randomly generated realizations of the placement of consumers and prosumers the performance of simulations was measured by assessing changes in aquifer head and the energy expended by consumer agents to pump groundwater 6 results 6 1 example scenario bc 70 base case scenario 70 bc 70 initialized 70 of agents 1 412 of 2016 agents as consumers and 30 604 agents as prosumers irrigation demand was highest in the summer months june august and significantly exceeded water supply prosumers harvested rainwater and sold it almost immediately to few consumer agents shown for the first year of simulation in fig 4 the precipitation decreased over the 21 year period fig 3 leading to increasing demands and a decreasing volume of supply to meet demand the total volume of traded water was reported as 201 2 ml or 8 6 of the total irrigation demand 2342 4 ml most of the irrigation demand was met through groundwater resources rather than harvested rainwater the maximum supply was calculated as the total volume of rainwater that was runoff from prosumer rooftops over the 21 year period to represent the maximum volume of water that could be traded the maximum supply was calculated as 456 ml only 44 of the maximum supply 201 2 ml was traded to meet demands although the total volume of demands exceeded the volume of maximum supply one reason for this is that approximately 50 of precipitation 38 4 cm per year fell during the late fall and winter months november to february consumer agents did not exert irrigation demand during winter months however and rainwater harvested by prosumers was wasted and not sold on the market the volume of traded water was not based on a simple comparison of supply and demand instead the volume of traded water emerged based on the timing of supply and demands in response to precipitation and evapotranspiration dynamics and the discrete mechanisms of rainwater harvesting tanks the mean head in the aquifer decreased by 0 6 m from 4 4 to 3 9 m over the simulated time horizon for bc 70 fig 5 due to decreasing levels of precipitation and the effects of irrigation withdraws higher levels of precipitation increased groundwater heads due to the effects of both increasing aquifer recharge and decreasing irrigation demand for example the head increased by 0 3 m between november and december 2006 4 5 to 4 8 m the wettest month of the simulation 29 5 cm lower levels of precipitation decreased recharge and increased irrigation demand the aquifer head decreased by 0 36 m between 2018 and 2020 corresponding to the driest period of the simulation annual precipitation of 50 49 and 44 cm for 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively quadrant ii beneath the population center fig 2 experienced the largest head change during the simulation declining 1 1 m over the 21 year time horizon figure s1 a declining groundwater table led to higher energy consumption required to pump water from a lower depth in the aquifer the unit energy of water or the amount of energy required to pump a unit volume of water demonstrated the effect of withdrawing groundwater on the cost of groundwater as shown in fig 5 the unit energy increased with a decreasing mean head following both seasonal and annual patterns the unit energy increased from an annual average of 102 2 kwh ml in 2000 to 105 5 kwh ml in 2020 3 2 increase the effect of increasing unit energy on overall energy consumption was negligible however and the total energy consumption was driven by the volume of water withdrawn for irrigation figure s2 6 2 performance analysis across all base case scenarios the mrar system was simulated for 11 base case scenarios ranging from 0 to 100 consumers the locations of agents with prosumer or consumer behaviors were controlled and remained similar between scenarios as described above scenarios were evaluated based on the volume of traded water impacts to the groundwater table and energy consumption at low percentages of consumers the maximum supply exceeded the total demand and consumers were able to meet a significant proportion of their demand through trades fig 6a scenario bc 10 reported the highest percentage of demand met through trades at 82 fig 6b the highest volume of traded water was reported for scenario bc 30 at 344 ml of traded water fig 6a scenarios bc 20 and bc 40 report similar performance at more than 330 ml of traded water for scenario bc 30 the volume of traded water was 32 of the maximum supply produced through runoff from prosumer roofs the percentage peaks at 49 for scenario bc 90 fig 6b these results demonstrate that though the supply is much greater than the demand for some scenarios the dynamics of supply and demand drive the total volume of traded water aquifer head monotonically decreased with additional consumers fig 7a due to the increasing total demands exerted for each scenario each bc scenario was simulated without micro trading where consumers withdrew water for irrigation but prosumers did not recharge the aquifer with rainwater the improvement in groundwater tables due to micro trading was evaluated at each time step as the difference in the groundwater table between with micro trading and without micro trading relative to the groundwater table without micro trading the effect of micro trading resulted in marginally higher groundwater tables fig 7b and improvements were non linear improvements in the groundwater table increased monotonically for scenarios bc 90 to bc 30 scenarios bc 30 and bc 20 reported similar performance with an average improvement of 0 67 and 0 66 respectively over the last five years 2016 2021 the performance for scenario bc 10 dropped to an average improvement of 0 55 over the last five years which was inferior to the performance for scenario bc 50 the unit energy of water for bc scenarios increased with increasing numbers of consumers fig 8 due to the decreasing elevation of the groundwater table unit energy was sensitive to the elevation of consumer agents as consumer agents at high elevations required more energy to pump water from the aquifer raising the average unit energy of water the unit energy peaked at bc 60 which is the peak of the average elevation of consumer agents the peak in average elevation is an artifact of the randomized distribution of consumer agents during model initialization the unit energy of water was also calculated for each bc scenario without micro trading fig 8 and the difference between unit energy for bc scenarios with micro trading and without micro trading was reported as the savings in unit energy inset in fig 8 micro trading generated only small energy savings when compared to the same scenarios without micro trading due to marginal reductions in depletion of the groundwater table the greatest difference in unit energy was reported for the bc 30 scenario which also reported the highest volume of traded rainwater and the greatest improvement to the groundwater table as described above for each of the metrics traded water groundwater heads and savings in unit energy the bc 20 and bc 40 scenarios performed similarly to the bc 30 scenario the abm approach facilitates new insight to the non linear improvement in unit energy and groundwater tables that emerged with micro trading at different ratios of consumers to prosumers these results can be used to provide guidance in developing micro trading for the wolfpack mrar the optimal ratio of consumer to prosumers is in the range of 1 5 to 2 5 7 sensitivity analysis 7 1 hydraulic conductivity to evaluate the impacts of hydraulic parameters on the model the bc scenarios were executed for varying k x y and k z values settings for k x y originally set at 4 5 m day were specified at 3 0 6 0 46 and 457 m day the ratio of k x y to k z was maintained at 0 001 for all values of k x y consistent with the relationship exhibited in glacial till vaccaro et al 1998 the hydraulic conductivity settings created a range of dynamics for the aquifer head results are shown for quadrant ii in fig 9 low conductivity values created a high head at initialization however pumping reduced the groundwater head at a faster rate when compared with high conductivity values for example the mean head in quadrant ii for k x y 4 5 m day with 100 consumers fell below the head in an aquifer with k x y 6 0 m day and 0 consumers at the end of the simulation high values for hydraulic conductivity resulted in aquifer dynamics that did not respond to changes in withdrawals and there was little difference in the head across all bc scenarios for k x y 457 m day the hydraulic conductivity scenarios were executed with and without micro trading to evaluate the impacts of hydraulic conductivity on energy consumption changes in the aquifer head had a marginal effect on energy consumption micro trading generated small reductions in unit energy for all values of hydraulic conductivity except for k x y 457 m day which did not show any reduction in unit energy due to micro trading fig 10 low values of k x y allowed higher changes in the head of the aquifer associated with pumping when compared to high values of k x y though the energy required increased for higher values of hydraulic conductivity the most efficient allocation of consumer and prosumer agents remained consistent for each setting for hydraulic conductivity the highest energy savings were generated for scenario bc 30 with similar performance for bc 20 and bc 40 in choosing locations where mrar systems would be most efficient aquifers with low hydraulic conductivity can generate higher energy savings and result in improved aquifer heads 7 2 location of consumer and prosumer agents to test the sensitivity of the performance of the mrar system to the distribution of consumer and prosumer agents across the topography nine base case scenarios bc 10 through bc 90 were run 30 times with randomly assigned consumer and prosumer behaviors the location of consumer and prosumer agents did not change the volume of traded water and the distribution of agent behaviors across the aquifer had a marginal impact on the head in the aquifer the maximum difference among the 30 random simulations based on the mean head at the final time step of the simulation 21 years was reported for the bc 30 scenario for this scenario the difference in head between the simulation that reports the minimum energy consumption and the simulation that reports the maximum energy consumption was 0 3 cm which represents less than a 1 difference in the elevation of the groundwater table while bc 30 was reported above as the most efficient ratio of consumers to prosumers it was also the scenario that was most affected by the location of consumers and prosumers energy was in turn affected by the location of agents as the elevation of individual agents affects energy required for pumping the mean energy consumption mwh annual per capital energy consumption kwh consumer agent year and unit energy of water kwh ml across 30 simulations for each bc scenario are reported in the supplemental material table s1 the total energy consumption increased nearly linearly at a rate of approximately 34 6 mwh for each 10 increase in consumers fig 11a the standard deviation of total energy use was an order of magnitude lower however and the total energy consumption in the model was not sensitive to changes in the location of consumer and prosumer agents fig 11a instead the primary drivers of energy consumption were the number of consumers and the volume of water consumed the location of consumers and prosumers had a more noticeable effect on unit energy fig 11b the standard deviation of unit energy across 30 random simulations was high for low percentages of consumers indicating that unit energy was influenced by the distribution of agent behaviors 8 discussion this study tested the hydraulic performance of a smart water grid for micro trading harvested rainwater through a peer to peer water market that allows residential households to harvest sell and buy rainwater conveying traded water through shallow groundwater aquifer the ratio of consumers to prosumers significantly impacts the efficiency of micro trading programs and the abm framework provides an approach to assess these effects simulations that were conducted for the bc scenarios found that a ratio of consumers to prosumers that is set at 3 7 or 30 consumers leads to the most efficient market based on volume of traded water groundwater improvements and savings in unit energy and the performance for 20 and 40 consumers was similarly high hydraulic conductivity was varied to test the effects of aquifer properties on market outcomes results showed that the most efficient settings remained at 30 consumers based on savings in unit energy regardless of the hydraulic conductivity the effect of the market in improving groundwater tables and unit energy was greatest for lower values of hydraulic conductivity or aquifers where groundwater is not transmitted as easily sensitivity analysis tested the effects of the location of consumer and prosumer agents by initializing consumer and prosumer assignments randomly results demonstrated that stochasticity in agent behavior assignment created a negligible effect on groundwater head and total energy consumed the location of consumer and prosumer agents affect the emergent unit energy required to pump water and for very low participation of consumers e g 10 there was a wider variation in unit energy attention should be paid to the location of consumer households for systems with low participation in the market in summary the mrar supplied a substantial proportion of irrigation water demand for low ratios of consumers to prosumers but the effects of micro trading on improving the groundwater table and energy consumption are small in magnitude further research should explore how these effects would scale in dense urban areas previous research explored the performance of a similar micro trading program a smart water grid that uses a dual reticulated network as the infrastructure for conveying traded rainwater ramsey et al 2020 a micro trading market that uses pipe infrastructure to transmit traded water has several limitations first the smart water grid relies on a centralized non potable water distribution network which limits its applicability beyond communities that can afford the investment needed to construct a second pipe network parallel to the drinking water system second the smart water grid was not developed with on site water treatment processes for rainwater which raises concerns about water quality within the system finally the smart water grid requires sellers to expend significant energy to pump rainwater into the network which may discourage seller participation in the network using a shallow aquifer instead of a pipe network to transmit traded water generates several benefits a mrar system eliminates the reliance of consumers and prosumers on a centralized network for some non potable water demands reduces water quality issues via groundwater percolation and reduces the entry costs for prosumers to participate in the network the mrar system because it allows groundwater based trades may provide a more practical system for facilitating micro trading but further research is needed to address remaining limitations areas of further research are described as follows 8 1 water quality water quality is a significant concern for managed aquifer recharge programs and stormwater that percolates through a groundwater system may not be considered fit for potable purposes dillon et al 2019 the mrar that is demonstrated in this research assumes that consumers use extracted groundwater for irrigation purposes only and prosumers remove the first flush of rainwater to safeguard water quality prosumer agents recharge using rainwater which would have higher water quality than stormwater and gravity fed dry wells are typically drilled to an elevation that is above the water table providing flow pathways that can purify water as it infiltrates further research is needed to characterize the fate and transport of water quality constituents in the vadose zone when harvested rainwater is gravity fed through dry wells and additional water treatment may be required to satisfy stakeholder expectations or water quality regulations for groundwater systems research that characterizes water quality parameters within a mrar system is necessary to ensure that unnecessary health risks are mitigated 8 2 smart technologies micro trading programs rely heavily on smart and connected technologies to rapidly sense and communicate demands and facilitate microtransactions the mrar system as envisioned in this research relies on smart sensors actuators blockchain and smart contracts advanced metering infrastructure and smart water meters collect accurate high resolution water consumption data to enable accurate micro trading and actuators are needed to automatically pump or release water once a trade is conducted blockchain acts as a distributed secure ledger to enable digital transactions without requiring involvement of a trusted third party organization nakamoto 2008 smart contracts work as simple scripts encoded on the blockchain to settle financial transactions between buyers and sellers christidis and devetsikiotis 2016 the mrar system would be a cyberphysical system that tightly integrates physical infrastructure and information and communications technology ict smart technologies are not explicitly modeled in the framework described in this manuscript and further research is needed to explore the hardware and software components that should be integrated with physical infrastructure to enable micro trading relying on smart technologies to facilitate decentralized peer to peer markets can have unintended effects on the delivery of resources new research is needed to explore and mitigate any impacts that micro trading may have on the privacy and security of households equitable provision and quality of water resources and energy consumption of smart technologies 8 3 human behaviors public perceptions participation and water consumption a mrar system can be affected by uncertainty in human behaviors as households interact with peers and with the hydrologic system the framework presented here uses a monthly theoretical outdoor water demand model which may overestimate or simplify the amount of water consumed for irrigation refined methods for estimating irrigation are needed to improve the accuracy of the modeled demands in the formulation presented here prosumer agents do not exert irrigation demands the formulation can be readily updated to allow prosumers to use water to irrigate onsite before micro trading water it is expected that allowing prosumers to consume rainwater would decrease the effectiveness of the market and lead to a decrease in the optimal ratio of consumer to prosumer agents an increase in the required number of prosumers climate drives the volume of water that is required for irrigation and the volume of rainwater that is collected and the framework can be applied to test the efficiency of the mrar system for climate change scenarios and locations with varying precipitation patterns water treatment applied at the point of use or at infiltration sites can be used to expand the array of end uses met through trading and potentially improve the efficiency of the mrar by meeting larger volumes of demands additional uncertainty should be resolved in water use and water generation as new end uses and water sources are incorporated this research simulated a simple exchange between households where consumers and prosumers were randomly matched and consumers were matched with additional prosumers until their demands were satisfied or no rainwater storage remained in the system further research is needed to capture the effects of a realistic economic market for example an abm was developed to study a residential electricity micro trading market and a bilateral market was simulated to match consumer and prosumer agents based on willingness to pay and willingness to accept monroe et al 2020 a bilateral market can be simulated for a mrar system using data about the cost of water and alternative water sources research has shown that non potable water is perceived as an inferior substitute for potable water in irrigation and considerable cost savings may be needed to incentivize consumers to use non potable water for irrigation lee et al 2021 it is expected that the reduced value of non potable water and transaction costs involved in a market would lead to losses in the efficiency of a mrar system the research conducted here while it does not consider the realities of an economic market can be considered as an upper bound on the performance of a mrar system to improve groundwater tables and conserve water resources finally new research is needed to explore the expected participation in a micro trading system social norms and value driven attitudes are the most significant predictors of acceptance of stormwater reuse mankad et al 2019 a survey of attitudes around stormwater reuse found significantly higher acceptance of stormwater treated via managed aquifer recharge for non drinking purposes when compared with drinking purposes mankad et al 2019 other surveys have shown that water scarcity increases stakeholder acceptance of water trading markets keenan et al 1999 rahimova et al 2016 quesnel and ajami 2017 and water reuse garcia cuerva et al 2016 smart technologies that automate micro trading can reduce transaction costs but may create high barriers to entry as a result of these perceptions significant efforts may be needed to reach critical levels of adoption that can substantially conserve groundwater resources educational campaigns may be required as part of a mrar system to encourage widespread adoption and onsite treatment options may be needed to overcome perceptions further research can explore cluster solutions where a small number of households contribute rainwater to a shared well as households may be more likely to participate if they are not required to drill and maintain a well onsite a larger number of households would lead to the need for additional infrastructure to store large volumes of rainwater convey rainwater to a shared well or inject rainwater into the groundwater through pumping further research should explore tradeoffs between infrastructure costs and participation rates for varying levels of decentralization 9 conclusions this study simulated and tested the performance of a mrar system which is a decentralized peer to peer rainwater micro trading network that relies on an unconfined aquifer to convey traded water in a mrar system residential households capture and trade rainwater within a network of participating households purchasing agents pump all water for irrigation needs out of the aquifer and selling agents recharge the groundwater table with harvested rainwater once it has been purchased this research explored the impact of the allocation of consumers and prosumers hydraulic conductivity and the location of consumers and prosumers on water savings aquifer levels and energy consumption for the scenarios considered in this research energy savings and the volume of traded water were highest when 20 40 of participants were consumers and these results were consistent across aquifer properties tested in this research the location of consumer and prosumers across an aquifer affects variability in the unit energy of water but has only a marginal effect on groundwater head and total energy consumed future research is needed to explore the integration of smart technologies the fate and transport of water quality constituents and the effect of public perceptions and economic behaviors on the performance of a mrar system there is a growing interest in using decentralized infrastructure to provide urban services historically the built environment provides engineering services through centralized facilities to optimize efficiency through economies of scale the centralized approach to infrastructure design has been criticized however due to high environmental emissions high energy consumption and vulnerability to disasters sharma et al 2010 leigh and lee 2019 schmack et al 2019 there has been an emerging interest in providing engineering services through decentralized infrastructure which can save energy and water reduce infrastructure costs increase resiliency and provide equitable access to services a micro trading system builds on the advantages introduced through decentralized services by giving community members increased agency over their water use and water conservation decisions urban water managers can use the mrar system developed in this research to construct decentralized water

2221,in the paper we evaluated some of the prominent mathematical models derived from darcy s law used to describe filtration membrane fouling occurring during the clarification of turbid fluids the fouling can occur by basic mechanisms like surface pore blocking pore constriction obstruction caking or their combination the paper presents a novel application of these models to the infiltration of overland flow into the soil the soil as a porous medium is assumed to be the filter the soil infilling that occurs during structural seal formation is assimilated to the membrane fouling process and the turbid fluid is the flow enriched in fine particles due to the illuviation of the soil particles detached by raindrop impact and overland flow explicit mathematical equations were derived for the dynamics of the free surface area for infiltration the resistance of the infiltration porous medium the infiltration rate the cumulative infiltration volume and the saturated hydraulic conductivity the fluid characteristics and the validation dataset were provided by the serlab soil erosion laboratory 42 59 34 n 12 17 27 e italy of the university of perugia and derives from a sequence of rainfall simulation experiments in a silty clay loam the better fits were obtained by combining the models that simulate the basic mechanisms of the free surface pore area blocking and the increase in the medium resistance due to pore obstruction by infilling fine particles both processes occur during structural crust formation as a model reproducing the fine particles infilling pores both at the surface and at the underneath layer could describe the behaviour of the infiltration data the contribution of this process should be added in modelling the dynamics of structural seal formation and

introduction darcy s law establishes a linear dependence between the filtration flow velocity and the hydraulic gradient between two points of a porous medium the constant of proportionality k s is called saturated hydraulic conductivity and it is typically measured by infiltrometer tests the k s depends on the soil texture granulometry and structure bulk density porosity in an ideal porous medium rigid and unchangeable over time k s should not vary for the soil as a non ideal porous medium reliable estimates of saturated hydraulic conductivity are challenging due to soil properties spatial and temporal variability temporal changes in soil hydraulic and structural properties are essentially due to changes in the pore system during rainfall rousseva et al 2002 and may stem from a variety of mechanisms occurring when raindrops hit the soil surface such as splash slaking dispersion compaction infilling of underlying pores by fine particles and surface sealing mcintyre 1958 chen et al 1980 pagliai et al 1983 torri et al 1987 mapa et al 1986 le bissonnais 1996 rousseva et al 2002 lado et al 2004 souza et al 2014 vinci et al 2020 todisco et al 2022 the citations given above are far from being exhaustive of the literature in the field which is very extensive most previous studies aimed to explain what was observed in quantitative terms particularly relevant is the reduction of saturated hydraulic conductivity k s with increasing rainfall duration armenise et al 2018 and with cumulative rainfall after tillage due to the very unstable pore geometry produced by this operation mapa et al 1986 showed the temporal variability of k s due to deformation and reduction of macropores space resulting from repeated wetting and drying many studies were carried out during research on sealing and crusting e g ndiaye et al 2005 only a few investigations attempted to measure the properties e g thickness bulk density porosity of seals formed during rain and link them to the causes using quantitative relations farres 1978 linked the increase of seal thickness during rain with cumulative rainfall tackett and pearson 1965 related the bulk density increase to cumulative rain exponentially mualen and assouline 1990 suggested that the bulk density is the highest at the soil surface and decreases exponentially with depth to that of undisturbed soil boiffin 1984 observed that the decreases in porosity of the upper soil layer are related to the duration of exposure to rain panini et al 1997 analysing thin soil sections found that most of the reduction in porosity is due to the loss of elongated pores and linked the decay to causative factors such as rainfall energy the equations proposed by panini et al 1997 were integrated by rousseva et al 2002 with information on the dynamics of some other porosity characteristics like the pore size which is crucial for defining hydraulic conductivity in some soil types a reduction in porosity was recorded at the immediate soil surface just after the rainfall started this trend continued throughout the rainfall event this behaviour is compatible with the aggregate breakdown due to rainfall impact splash erosion torri et al 1987 and the so called depositional seal modelled as additional porosity rousseva et al 2002 todisco et al 2022 a recent improvement in the studies on porosity dynamics during wetting drying cycles and the key role played by macropores on k s came from x ray scanning of the soil profile sandin et al 2017 luo et al 2010 kim et al 2010 furthermore armenise et al 2018 used x ray to characterize the relevant stages of seal formation namely aggregate breakdown and particle re organization clearly detecting an abrupt and distinct zone of reduced porosity at the topsoil compatible with the structural seal described in mualem et al 1990 this process is consistent with the well established formation of fine particle bands bielders and baveye 1995 in particular the particles mobilized by impacting drops during rainfall or by share forces exerted by overland flowing water are transported by water vertically in the soil leading to fine particle deposition bands inside the pores this process may largely contribute to the decrease in hydraulic conductivity associated with structural crust formation particle detachment at the soil surface has been extensively studied in relation to structural crust formation and soil erosion however those studies do not provide evidence of vertical particle displacement by water in the soil except those focusing on surface seal development and morphology mualem et al 1990 bielders and baveye 1995 bielders and grymonprez 2010 clearly stated that drop impact is a major contributor to particle mobilization liberating large amounts of silt and clay particles beyond the depth directly affected by drop impact also todisco et al 2022 already pointed out that the effect of the deposition inside the pores of the fine particles transported by the infiltrating water is not separated by the effects of rainfall impact bielders and baveye 1995 linked fine particle eluviation and the thickness of the surface washed in layer to the kinetic energy of rain by linear regressions these suggest that the ultimate cause is the same and unique i e raindrop impacts actually raindrop impact causes aggregate disruption and separation of primary particles from the soil mass runoff keeps the fine particles in suspension and carries them along its path some runoff water infiltrates the soil bringing fine particles into the soil these fine particles will be deposited partially during transport and completely during desiccation after the rainfall has ceased this causes a redistribution of fine particles inside the pore system which is proportional to the amount of detached fine particles hence to the raindrop impacts usually estimated as proportional to rainfall kinetic energy we know that such redistribution cannot easily explain the porosity increase that sometimes occurs after rainfall todisco et al 2022 however the fine particle infilling of pores should be considered as an additional process along with the drop compaction producing the pore decrease during rainfall and structural crust formation the relative importance of the single processes cannot be assessed until they are separately measured let us suppose that a model where infiltration is driven only by fine particles infilling of pores was able to describe the behaviour of the infiltration data in that case there are solid reasons for conducting further research to measure raindrop impact and fine particle infilling processes separately an example of the importance of this process in correctly evaluating infiltration at a basin or slope scale is the infiltration at the interface between clay soil upstream and sandy soil downstream runoff rich in clay infiltrates the sandy soil reducing permeability also extracting pedofunctions for determining the infiltration parameters based on soil characteristics could benefit from a more precise attribution of the causes if we omit the infilling we attribute a different importance to the clay than the other fractions because we have to overestimate the effect of drop impact compaction in more clayey soils as far as we know a mathematical model with explicit equations conceptualising the soil permeability reduction due to the seal formation and the porosity blocking due to illuviated particles deposition in the soil profile has not yet been formulated by mathematical model we mean the description of a process made a priori if this process does not take place then the infiltration will not go according to what is described by the model an explicit model describes what is happening and uses equations that describe the physics of the process this allows an evaluation of the trend due to the single process described this paper attempts to mathematically model the mechanics of vertical transport of soil particles mobilized by drop impact and overland flow by water in the soil profile and the consequent permeability reduction due to structural modification of the soil porosity during rainfall for this purpose we adapted models describing the filtration or clarification of solid particles from fluids in industrial filtration the problem to be addressed is the control of the dynamics of the filter membrane clogging process with the consequent reduction of the volume of filtered fluid in the unit of time hermia 1982 bolton et al 2006 cimini and moresi 2014 ceppitelli and marconi 2018 the conceptual modelling approach assumes that the porous medium is rigid and subject to blockage and permeability reduction due to the process called fouling which is caused by the deposition of particles both inside or on top of the membrane hermia 1982 grace 1956 the fouling models were derived from darcy s law four mechanistic explicit mathematical models hermia 1982 are typically used to describe fouling complete pore blocking assumes that particles seal off pore entrances and prevent flow intermediate pore blocking assumes that a portion of the particles seal off a part of the surface pores and the rest accumulate on top of other deposited particles fig 1 a cake filtration occurs when particles accumulate on the surface of a membrane in a permeable cake of increasing thickness that adds resistance to flow fig 1b standard pore blocking assumes that the porous medium is rigid hence the particles accumulate inside membranes on the walls of straight cylindrical pores fig 1c as particles are deposited the pores become constricted and the membrane s permeability is reduced these models found wide application in the simulation of cross flow microfiltration processes in which the filtered fluid flows tangentially to the membrane bolton et al 2006 developed models that describe the combined fouling mechanism founding explicit equations that relate the pressure to the time during a constant flow operation and the infiltration volume to the time during a constant pressure operation the latter type was here reinterpreted to be applied to the infiltration of overland flow into the erodible soil under saturated conditions the water flow is turbid because it is enriched in fine particles due to the illuviation of the soil particles detached by raindrop impact and overland flowing water during erosion the models cannot simulate the sediment load dynamics and the compaction due to impinging drops as the porous media is assumed to be rigid in analogy with the membrane the fluid characteristics are therefore given as input data and the models are used to describe mathematically three mechanisms that contribute to structural crust formation during wetting under saturated conditions 1 the surface pore obstruction ipb model fig 1a bringing about progressive superficial pore clogging the ipb could be considered the conceptual representation of the progressive soil surface reduction in porosity due to obstruction 2 the deposition at the soil surface model cf fig 1b bringing about an increase in the surface resistance to water infiltration the cf could be considered the conceptual modelling of the deposition of the particles in the soil surface illuviated by water but enabled to enter the soil 3 the subsurface porosity obstruction spb model fig 1c inducing the increase of the media resistance the spb could be considered a conceptual representation of pore clogging and porosity modification in the soil profile due to the deposition of the particles illuviated by water or porosity collapse during wetting the objective of the paper is to evaluate if models where infiltration is driven only by fine particles infilling of pores are able to describe the behaviour of the infiltration data to this end the basic hermia models hermia 1982 and the combined bolton models bolton et al 2006 were tested under constant pressure conditions we derived explicit equations that relate cumulative infiltration volume to time infiltration rate to time and the saturated hydraulic conductivity to time and characteristics of the porous medium and the turbid fluid the accuracy of the models was tested by infiltration data measured in rainfall simulation experiments performed at serlab soil erosion laboratory university of perugia italy in a silty clay loam soil 2 the filtration models 2 1 darcy s law in the context of filtration processes the constant pressure hermia s models hermia 1982 are typically used to describe the membrane fouling that can occur by the deposition of particles inside or on top of the filter these models estimate the flow decline across the membrane during the fouling of the four models typically used to describe fouling only three are considered in this investigation intermediate pore blocking ipb fig 1a assumes that a portion of the particles seal off pore entrances and only considers the reduction of the free surface area for filtration a assuming constant resistance r of the filter medium this model estimates the reduction of a as proportional to the infiltrated volume and the characteristics of the solid particles diameter cake filtration cf fig 1b occurs when particles accumulate on the surface of a membrane in a permeable cake of increasing thickness that adds resistance to flow entrance keeping a constant this model estimates the increasing r as proportional to the infiltrated volume the seal thickness and the fluid density standard pore blocking spb fig 1c assumes that particles accumulate inside the membrane on the walls of straight cylindrical pores affecting the reduction of the pore section and membrane permeability keeping a constant this model estimates the increasing r as proportional to the modified underneath soil thickness and the infiltrated flow concentration bolton et al 2006 combined individual hermia s models to develop new models from now on called bolton s models that described combined fouling mechanisms in particular we used a model where the fouling derives from the reduction of a and the increase of r of the filter medium during constant pressure operation in the following section the reference models of hermia and bolton are described in detail highlighting their characteristics and differences in infiltration process conceptualization and mathematics for further details refer to the papers of hermia 1982 and bolton et al 2006 2 2 hermia s and bolton s models the hermia models hermia 1982 derive from darcy s law which estimates the flow rate q m 3 s as a function of the medium resistance r 1 m and the free surface area a m 2 for infiltration as follow 1 q p a r μ where p n m 2 is the trans membrane pressure that in darcy s equation corresponds to the hydraulic gradient and μ n s m 2 is the solution viscosity three models were tested that are based on different hypotheses on the behaviour of a and r 2 2 1 model assuming variable available surface area a and constant medium resistance r ipb hermia 1982 the ipb model is based on the premise that the particles larger than the pore size seal off the surface and the smaller particles accumulate on top of other deposited particles the model estimates the reduction of the filtration area in time assuming as a constant the resistance r of the filtrating porous medium denoted by q 0 a 0 r 0 the initial data with r r 0 for every t 0 from darcy s equation we get 2 q q 0 a a 0 this model uses a successive approximation method to estimate the reduction of the free surface area let v 1 be the volume that filters in a first interval of time δ t the solid particles contained in it occupy and block a portion of the surface equal to σ v 1 so the free surface is a 1 a 0 σ v 1 to calculate σ see eq 12 let v 2 be the volume filtered in the interval 2 δ t and δ v 2 v 2 v 1 the one filtered in a second interval of time δ t assuming that the suspension is perfectly homogeneous the probability that the particles contained in δ v 2 occupy a portion of the free surface is a 1 a 0 so the increment of the blocked

particles assumed to be spherical the volume of the particle will be π d 3 6 the surface projected onto the membrane is approximately equal to π d 2 4 the volume of particles contained in the filtered volume v can be approximated with v γ s s γ 0 where γ s k g m 3 is the density of the turbid fluid γ 0 k g m 3 is the density of the solid particles and s is the mass fraction of the solids in the suspension now the surface of the totality of the particles projected on the filter membrane is 11 σ v 6 π d 3 π d 2 4 v γ s s γ 0 by simplifying the previous equation σ 1 m is given by 12 σ 1 5 γ s s

important and with the hypothesis of constantly available surface area a a 0 for every t 0 from darcy s equation we get 13 q q 0 r 0 r 2 2 2 1 spb model this model assumes that particles accumulate inside membranes on the walls of straight cylindrical pores thus the pore volume decreases in proportion to the filtered volume the pores are assumed to have a constant diameter and length the radius r m of the pores decreases due to the solid matter that accumulates on the pore walls the reduction of the pore section as a function of the infiltrated volume in hermia 1982 is expressed as follow 14 n 2 π r d r l c d v where n is the number of pores l m the length of each pore supposed to be equivalent to the thickness of the soil layer affected by structural modifications and c the volume of particles deposited per unit of filtered volume integrating with the initial data v r 0 0 we have 15 cv n π l r 0 2 r 2 using the constant pressure poiseuille equation the flow rate can be expressed

process in the soil experiencing overland flow and erosion under porous medium structural modification and crust formation in this case the flow direction is also tangential to the filtering medium similar to cross flow microfiltration in analogy with the filter membrane it is assumed that the porous medium is rigid and that the slurry fluid is the overland flow composed of runoff water and solid particles detached by raindrop impact and sheet flow furthermore in fouling models the slurry fluid s characteristics are known as those of the fluid to be filtered so we must assign a sediment load concentration in the flow and a dimensional characteristic of the sediment these depend on rainfall features e g energy intensity etc runoff characteristics and dynamics and soil and surface properties still the fouling models cannot highlight the direct role of rainfall intensity and energy in sediment load and runoff characteristics besides during rainfall part of the sealing process is caused by surface compaction due to the drop impacting energy fouling models do not reproduce this mechanical process but reproduce the effects on the soil surface of the particles deposition and on the soil profile of the fine particles illuviated by the flow infilling the pores in fact during the soil sealing process occurs the reduction of the porosity area a at the soil surface and an increase in resistance r to infiltration flow both for compaction and for pores obstruction infilling furthermore the porous medium is assumed to be saturated as the fouling models assume constant pressure conditions therefore in our application the combined models are probably more appropriate since they allow us to consider the variations of both a and r we selected the ipb spb and ipb cf model combinations which may be appropriate for estimating the infiltration decline during sealing formation a comparison between the results obtained with the combined models and those with the basic ipb model will highlight the contribution of the spb and cf to the process simulation 3 1 materials the data were provided by the serlab soil erosion laboratory 42 59 34 n 12 17 27 e italy todisco et al 2019 bagarello et al 2018 todisco et al 2015 of the university of perugia and derived from three experiments ej with j 1 2 3 on bare silty clay loam soil carried out in a plot 1 m width 0 92 m length and slope 16 each experiment consists of a sequence of three simulated rainfalls todisco et al 2022 hereinafter i ii and iii carried out over a few weeks before each experiment the soil was manually harrowed to obtain a fine seedbed almost 10 cm deep and with clods smaller than 5 cm the rainfall simulator vergni et al 2018 todisco 2014 todisco et al 2019 installed over the micro plot provides a constant rainfall intensity of about 70 mm h and a kinetic energy rate of 14 5 j mm m2 a wetting before the rainfall simulation ensured constant initial soil moisture the soil water content and the bulk density in the first 0 05 m depth were measured by a gravimetric procedure using a 100 cm3 sampler at the initial and end times of each rainfall structure from motion sfm photogrammetry surveys were conducted to quantify the surface roughness dynamics with the cumulative rainfall and rainfall energy the entire runoff volume v was sampled every 5 min to determine the hydrographs at the down most section of the plots the corresponding infiltration rate q was computed as the difference between the rainfall intensity and the measured runoff the runoff samples were also analysed to obtain the soil sediment concentration dynamics and the particle size distribution for each granulometric component clay fine and coarse silt small medium and coarse sand table 1 the dataset consists of 139 observations of rainfall intensity runoff infiltration rate and sediment concentration the independent variable in each rainfall episode is the initial soil surface condition porous medium structural characteristics which is progressively modified by the drop impact the surface flow and generally by the structural modification of the porous medium therefore the initial value of these characteristics is different for rainfalls i ii and iii for more details on the rainfall simulator see vergni et al 2018 regarding the measurement methodology see vinci et al 2020 todisco et al 2022 todisco et al 2020 vinci et al 2016 in which the experiments were widely described and the data analysed to study the effect of successive rainfalls on the soil surface roughness surface bulk density and porosity infiltration and k s dynamics several statements can be of interest to this work and the parametrization of the filtration models 1 a wetting before the rainfall simulation ensured constant initial soil moisture the soil moisture remained almost constant during the subsequent simulations with end values mean 30 7 and cv 6 7 very close to the initial ones the porous medium can therefore be considered saturated when the simulations start 2 the surface roughness decays exponentially with cumulative rainfall depth and energy in some cases it increases in the dry period between two rainfalls vinci et al 2020 3 the surface bulk density increases with cumulative rainfall depth and energy and sometimes decreases in the dry period between two rainfalls the opposite behaviour is expected for the total porosity derived from the bulk density data todisco et al 2022 4 porosity number of pores and area occupied by pores in the soil surface sorptivity hydraulic conductivity and time to incipient ponding show a decreasing dynamic during the experiments todisco et al 2020 table 2 5 the sediment concentration increases along with the cumulative runoff and infiltration volumes as the experiment progresses table 1 fig 2 6 the runoff coefficient decreases along with the cumulative rainfall and energy from the last tillage as the experiment progresses table 1 models accounting for an overall quick and consistent structural porous medium modification assouline and mualem 2002 panini et al 1997 rousseva et al 2002 further developed in todisco et al 2022 are adequate for the observed behaviour the runoff s stationary and cumulative values increase during the experiment table 1 7 the infiltration data clearly show a dynamic fig 3 with a decrease in the infiltration rate both during the single rainfall episode and during the experiment with the cumulative runoff and infiltration volumes the initial saturated condition assumed at point 1 of the current list is confirmed as the measured infiltration rate is at any time lower than the rainfall rate except for the initial part of the i simulations in e2 fig 3 8 this work cannot highlight the direct role of rainfall intensity and energy in sediment load and runoff characteristics as the database refers to simulations of constant intensity rain the cumulative structural modification occurred on the soil surface with an initial seedbed condition and was caused by three successive rainfalls separated by a period of progressive slow drying of the soil the database fig 2 fig 3 table 1 and table 2 clearly addresses the effects of these causes on the hydrological processes for this reason infiltration models that can account for the structural modification of the filtration medium by deposition of particles and pore blocking with cumulative rainfall i e infiltrated volumes could be appropriate to fit this database 3 2 methods hermia s and bolton s models adaptation to estimate infiltration dynamics under seal formation the formulation of the darcy s equation usually adopted in the infiltration processes in a porous medium is 38 q a 0 k s δ p φ l where φ n m 3 is the fluid specific weight l m is the distance and ks m s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the porous medium comparing the eqs 38 and 1 it is possible to express ks as a function of the variables involved in the hermia s and bolton s models as follows 39 k s t a t φ l a 0 μ r t in soil moisture conditions close to saturation with the prevalence of the gravitational component over the capillary one the δ p can be considered constant and equal to the atmospheric pressure in the ipb model eq 7 represents the reduction of the free surface infiltration in time a t eq 7 combined with eq 39 expresses the decrease of the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s with time as follows 40 k s t a 0 1 k i q 0 t φ l a 0 μ r 0 φ l 1 k i q 0 t μ r 0 where r r 0 μ φ and l are assumed to be constant eqs 8 and 9 express the infiltration rate q t and cumulative volume dynamic v t respectively the q t is a hyperbolic function with respect to time with the parameter ki the ki is defined in eq 6 where σ is expressed by eq 12 in this application the parameters of eq 12 are calculated as follows γ s density of the turbid fluid the turbid fluid is the runoff under erosion composed of water and soil sediments entrapped and transported the γ s is calculated as the density of the fluid mass of fluid the mass of solid per unit of volume density of water measured average concentration of the solids in the runoff kg m3 s mass fraction of the solids in the suspension the s is calculated as the ratio between the measured mean concentration of the solid in the runoff kg m3 and the density of the fluid kg m3 γ 0 solid particle density equal to 2650 kg m3 d diameter of particles that obstruct the surface pores it was assumed to be equal to 0 0002 m in tests i while it decreases to 0 0001 and 0 00005 m in subsequent tests ii and iii respectively these diameters were selected according to the observed dynamics of the sediment granulometry in the rainfall following tillage rainfall i the percentage of sand coarse material in the runoff is low and it tends to increase in the following rainfalls table 2 hence it is possible to suppose that the solid particles in the infiltrated fluid considered complementary to the granulometry in the runoff with regard to the original soil granulometry have initially higher and progressively decreasing diameters a0 was assumed to be 0 55 m2 in test i and then 0 52 and 0 48 m2 in tests ii and iii respectively it is determined based on the measured mean porosity of the soil data indeed it is observed that the surface porosity decreases going from test i to test iii of each experiment table 2 in the spb model eq 22 represents the increase in resistance over time r t the combination of the eqs 22 and 39 expresses the decrease of k s over time as follows 41 k s t a 0 φ l a 0 μ r φ l μ r 0 1 k p q 0 t 2 2 where a a 0 μ φ and l are assumed to be constant the k s is an inverse function of time and of k p of degree 2 denoting that the k s

the eqs 28 and 39 expresses the decrease of k s with time as follows 42 k s t a 0 φ l a 0 μ r φ l μ r 0 1 2 k c q 0 2 t where a a 0 μ φ and l are assumed to be constant eqs 26 and 27 express the infiltration rate and cumulative volume dynamic respectively the q t is a rational function of the time of degree 1 2 with the parameter k c the parameters of eq 24 for the calculation of kc are estimated starting from the available dataset as follows m ratio between the weights of the wet and dry crusts calculated by dividing the wet and dry weights of the soil samples α specific resistance of the crust m kg calculated as the crust s thickness per unit of volume and per unit of density numerically it is calculated as crust s thickness bulk density the thickness of the crust is assumed to be equal to 0 0007 m in test i while it increases up to 0 0009 and 0 002 m in subsequent tests ii and iii respectively these values are in accordance with previous research armenise et al 2018 the bulk density is assumed to be 1300 kg m3 according to the observed values table 2 γ density of the infiltrated fluid calculated as the average between the density of the runoff and that of water water density average measured concentration of the solid in the runoff water density 2 μ viscosity of the infiltrated fluid assumed to be equal to that of water 10 3 pl pa s for the combined models eqs 33 and 37 express the infiltration rate q t respectively for ipb spb and ipb cf models while eqs 32 and 36 express the cumulative volumes v t for ipb spb and ipb cf respectively the parameters k i k p and k c are calculated as described above in the ipb spb q t is a rational function of the time with the parameters k i and k p the combination of the eqs 7 22 and 39 expresses the decrease of k s

models providing on average the most accurate estimates of the infiltrated rate q t are ipb spb with a mean nush sutcliffe efficiency ns 0 92 in the ii rainfalls and a mean ns 0 74 in all experiments table 3 and ipb cf with a mean ns 0 89 in the iii rainfalls and a mean ns 0 76 in all experiments table 3 among the basic models the ipb is more efficient than the others with the exception of the i rainfall of e1 experiment in general the accuracy of ipb and combined models is lower just after soil surface tillage fig 4 in the i rainfall after tillage as shown in fig 3 the infiltration data are higher than the others clearly indicating that the infiltration volumes are the highest and decrease with the cumulative disturbance exerted by the impacting rainfall in the following rainfall episodes rainfalls ii and iii after tillage the combined models considering both the pore obturation and the increase in the resistance of the porous medium initially tend to underestimate the infiltration rate data while in the final part of the simulation they provide an excellent prediction on the other hand the simple models are more accurate in the first part of the simulation and give an overestimation later on this behaviour is highlighted in the graphs of fig 4 where the combined models are always below the others and very accurate in estimating the infiltration rate in the ii and iii rainfall and in the final part of the i the i simulation of the e3 is to be considered an outlier it provides results very different and apart from all the other trials probably deriving from an error in the measures or a very dry antecedent climatic condition also the models performance is poor in this simulation this trend is confirmed by comparing the estimated and measured final infiltration rates fig 5 b it can be observed that the basic models ibp spb and cf always overestimate the measured data while the prediction of the combined models shows an excellent agreement with the measured data also in these graphs the datum relative to the i simulation of the e3 appears as an evident outlier the final cumulative infiltration volumes calculated as the integral of the infiltration rate are plotted together with the corresponding measured data in fig 5a it is observed that the basic models ipb and spb provide a good estimation mainly due to the compensation between under and overestimations during the simulations indeed the estimated q t sometimes exceeds the measures instead the prediction of combined models slightly underestimates the final cumulative infiltration volumes because they never overestimate the q t fig 6 shows the boxplots representing the results relative to the entire dataset 139 observations of infiltration rate outliers are not given to improve readability the combined models provide the lowest mean absolute percentage error 22 for the ipb spb and 28 for the ipb cf the error in 75 of the cases is lower than 33 and 29 for the ipb spb and the ipb cf respectively furthermore the combined models present a lower variability as quantified by the lower interquartile range and shorter whiskers the ipb among the basic models provides the best performances with an error that in 75 of the cases remains lower than 50 5 discussion the results obtained can be interpreted in the light of the different process conceptualization methods that the tested models use in the ipb model the particles larger than the pore size seal off the surface and the smaller particles accumulate on top of other deposited particles in this way the ipb accounted for the reduction of the area available for infiltration in the soil surface and the dynamic of the area is expressed as a hyperbolic function of the time eq 7 and a decreasing exponential function of the infiltrated volume eq 10 the resistance of the medium is assumed to be constant the ipb model provides good results because the reduction of the surface area of the pores is an actual process occurring during seal formation reallocation of soil particles due to overland flow smoothening of the surface due to soil erosion water with sediment infiltration into the soil profile the estimation of the k i coefficient of the ipb model eqs 6 12 is a crucial step to improve the model s efficiency the k i depends on the diameter d of the solid particles transported and reallocated by the surface overland flow on γ s and s in this application γ s has been estimated from the observed concentration data section 3 2 and in the observed range of the diameter variability table 2 this assumption can be considered acceptable nevertheless a further investigation aimed at determining the functional relationship between γ s and d could give aid to the proper use of this model eq 40 explicitly describes the hyperbolic decrease over time of saturated hydraulic conductivity k s with parameter k i in analogy with the dynamics of the infiltration surface area a described in eq 7 in the spb and cf models only the increase in the resistance of the filter medium is considered and the porous surface area is assumed to be constant these hypotheses are less effective in reproducing the actual dynamics of the process and the estimates of the two models are less accurate fig 6 in spb the resistance dynamic is expressed as a quadratic function of the time eq 22 with parameter k p its increase depends on the reduction in the capillary diameters in the surface layer of thickness l due to the pore infilling by fine particles during wetting in this case l was assumed to be equal to a very superficial layer as for the ipb model the estimation of the k p coefficient eq 19 is a fundamental step the k p depends on the volume of particles deposited c that reduces the pore diameter increasing the resistance to the flow movement in fact k p increases with c and induces a decrease in the infiltration rate the thickness of the soil layer l the other parameter involved in eq 19 for k p has been assumed to be very low following armenise et al 2018 eq 41 explicitly describes the decrease of saturated hydraulic conductivity k s with time as rational function with parameter k p in analogy with the behaviour of the resistance r described in eq 22 according to the mathematical formulation of k s it is expected that the ipb model degree 1 leads to a decrease of the q t slower than spb degree 2 the estimated k s eqs 40 and 41 are mainly influenced by the values of k i and k p in fact the term squared k p 2 q o 2 t 2 4 at the denominator of eq 41 is negligible due to the very small value of q 0 as a consequence in the first rainfall after tillage in which k i k p the ibp infiltration rate is above that of the spb while in the following rainfalls the opposite occurs because the value of k i exceeds that of k p fig 4 in cf the resistance of the soil to the infiltration increases with the thickness of the surface crust and the dynamics is expressed as a square root function of the time eq 28 with the parameter k c the cf model provides the worst results compared with the other basic models the reason can be that in the model a reduction of the surface pore area available for infiltration does not correspond to the crust formation instead in the real process the structural and depositional crust determines both the increase of the surface resistance due to compaction and the reduction of surface pore area due to reallocation the estimation of the k c coefficient of the cf model eq 24 is a crucial step to improve the efficiency of the model an important parameter of k c is the specific coefficient of the resistance of the cake α expressed as a function of the crust thickness and the bulk density assumed according to the observations table 2 other parameters of k c are the viscosity and the density of the infiltrating fluid the problem of determining the viscosity of an overland flow during erosion process is much debated in the scientific community since it is difficult to solve and the data are rare furthermore it should be noted that the runoff data used are those collected at the end of the experimental plot and do not refer to the fluid actually infiltrated whose characteristics are not known but which are with a good approximation assumed to be equal to those of the surface runoff the results agree with those of todisco et al 2022 which highlighted how models that consider the porosity dynamics as a function of the height or energy of the cumulative rain are the most efficient in simulating the infiltration process described by this database the k c values are of the order of 106 according to other applications of hermia s models cimini et al 2014 bolton et al 2006 eq 42 explicitly describes the decrease of k s with time as a rational function with parameter k c in analogy with the behaviour of the resistance r described in eq 28 according to the mathematical formulation of k s the decrease of the infiltration rate simulated by the cf model degree 1 2 is generally slower than that simulated by both ipb and spb hence the corresponding simulated infiltration rate is above that of the ipb and spb except for the first rainfall after tillage where the estimations of the three models are closer fig 4 as it is possible to deduce from what has been commented above the combined models ipb spb and ipb cf provide the best results because they account for both the dynamics of the resistance and the surface pores area in these models all the parameters of the basic models involved are present and maintain the same functional role eqs 43 and 44 explicitly describe the decrease of k s with time as rational functions depending on the dynamics of the area a and resistance r of the corresponding basic models according to the mathematical formulation of k s the decrease of the infiltration rate simulated by combined models ipb spb and ipb cf degree 3 and 3 2 respectively is generally faster than that simulated by basic models hence the corresponding infiltration rate graphs are lower fig 4 the robustness of one of the best performing models i e the combined model ipb spb was evaluated by a global sensitivity analysis this technique aims to determine the relationships between the uncertainty in the independent variables and the uncertainty in the dependent variable cariboni et al 2007 the calculation details and the graphical results are shown in appendix i the results show that the model s output i e the infiltration rate q t eq 33 is always in a physically sound range fig i1 the left shift of the q t distribution with time fig i1 is consistent with the progressive deposition inside the pores of the particles mobilized by impacting drops illuviated by water and transported vertically in the soil profile during structural crust formation the most influential independent variable is the diameter of solid particles d fig i2 which exhibits a positive correlation with q t slightly decreasing with time the fact that d has a determining role in the model output agrees with the processes simulated by the ipb spb model both in the soil profile and in the soil surface the positive correlation is justified by the mathematical formulation of the model eq 33 12 6 and is physically consistent given that the probability of forming occluding layers decreases with increasing particle size other important variables fig i 2 are s γs and c all related to the sediment concentration in the suspension the negative correlation appears consistent with the simulated process since other factors being equal lower infiltration values are expected as the suspension concentration increases the role of the variables a0 and l related to the porosity and thickness of the surface soil layer respectively appears less important than the previous variables fig i 2 at any rate their positive correlation with q t agrees with the role played by these variables in the process the contribution of the initial infiltration rate q0 also appears consistent with the expectations indeed it shows a relatively high positive correlation in the initial phases of the process but subsequently its importance becomes negligible 6 conclusions the paper presents a novel application of the filtration membrane fouling models typically used to describe industrial filtration to the infiltration in the soil experiencing overland flow erosion and crust formation in the filtration models the fouling can occur by various basic mechanisms as the pore blocking pore constriction caking or a combination of the mechanisms of these models in this adaptation the filtration membrane is the porous medium soil assumed to be rigid in analogy with the membrane the slurry fluid is the overland flow enriched in fine particles due to the illuviation of the particles detached by impacting drops and the overland flowing water the models cannot simulate the hydrological process of flow and sediment load dynamics or the surface compaction due to the drop impacting energy as the porous media is assumed to be rigid the models only simulate the deposition of particles in the soil surface and the obstruction of surface and soil profile pores due to turbid fluid infiltration the fluid characteristics are therefore given as input data and in the paper are those of the surface runoff occurring during a rainfall event of given intensity in an erodible soil the principal outcomes of the investigation are 1 explicit mathematical equations were derived for the dynamics during sealing of the free surface area for infiltration a t the resistance of the infiltration porous medium r t the infiltration rate q t the cumulative infiltration volume v t and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks t 2 the combinations of the basic model intermediate pore blocking ipb with the standard pore blocking spb and the cake filtration cf yield the best fit ipb simulates the reduction of the surface pore area a t and the spb and cf model the increase of the porous medium resistance r t this result suggests that models in which infiltration is driven only by fine particle deposition reducing porosity in the soil surface and infilling pores in the soil profile can estimate infiltration data 3 the ipb model alone estimates satisfactorily the infiltration rate observed in the rainfall sequences following the initial tillage this indicates that the dynamics of the soil surface porosity have a very important role in the infiltration process also in a sequence of wetting and drying cycles at the same time the spb and cf models provide less accurate estimations of the observed infiltration rate since they only account for the increase in the resistance of the filter medium and assume a constant pore surface area 4 the most influential independent variable in the process of structural seal formation for porosity obstruction and infilling is the diameter of solid particles d which exhibits a positive correlation with q t slightly decreasing with time the positive correlation is physically consistent given that the probability of forming occluding layers decreases with increasing particle size 5 other important variables are all related to the sediment concentration in the fluid that is negatively correlated with the simulated infiltration values the success of the filtration models suggests that in soils where the silt and clay content is relatively abundant 20 or more the processes driving the infiltration dynamics need to be parameterized separately from the processes immediately due to raindrop impacts in terms of modelling this means that the equations describing the decrease of porosity todisco et al 2022 need an additional cause of variation due to the infilling of fine particles which depends primarily on the presence of silt and clay in the soil matrix and secondarily by the amount of those fine particles suspended in the infiltration water the particle content in the soil matrix should act as a switch excluding the infilling effects in the absence of fine particles let s assume that the porosity decrease is due to the reduction of the effective pore mean diameter d eq 13b in todisco et al 2022 and that d variation is proportional to the sediment load in the infiltrating fluid expressed as the product between the sediment load concentration csl and the infiltration rate q t then is δd k csl q t with k constant csl can be considered proportional to the soil clay content cs and the rainfall energy rainen csl cs k1 rainen with k1 constant thus in a first approximation the infiltration rate is introduced into the equation for determining the diameter and the effective porosity for accounting for the infiltration rate itself the soil clay content cs is not a prerequisite for getting clay into the soil neither is it the proper value to use during erosion on a slope with just one soil horizon topping over all of it the clay content in the suspended sediment is clay enriched with respect to the soil clay fraction the enrichment depends on the amount of sediment entrained into the runoff by runoff and drop impact but varies through an enrichment function that depends on the different particle sedimentation velocities if the soil along the slope varies in grain size characteristics then the sediment load entering the downslope soil has its own clay fraction built as described above that clay fraction will be changed accordingly to the contribution of clay by the downslope soil detachment and sedimentation and the loss sedimentation of the clay contributed by the upslope soil as an example takes two extreme soils the upslope one with 100 clay and the downslope one with 100 sand the sediment load will be all clay at the beginning of the downslope soil the clay contribution from the downslope soil will be nil hence the length necessary for all the clay to sediment will be affected by infiltrating water bringing clay into the pore system the needed approach is very similar to the one for pollutants with the difference that here there is a source and an extinction phase of the clay phosphorous is usually transported with clay hence the mathematics applied to the behavior of particular pollutants could be used lastly it should be noted that the data used in the analysis refer to the runoff collected at the end of the experimental plot and not to the fluid actually infiltrated whose characteristics are unknown it was assumed presumably with a good approximation that the surface runoff and the infiltrating fluid characteristics are the same further developments of the study could be carried out on datasets deriving from laboratory experiments in which the infiltrated fluid can be collected and analysed in such a way as to determine more accurately the composition and characteristic diameter of the sediment load illuviated also with reference

sensitivity analysis for the ipb spb model the sensitivity analysis of a generic model of the type i 1 y f x i i 1 m where y is the generic dependent variable xi the i th independent variable and m the number of independent variables is carried out following a few successive steps which can be summarized as follows 1 identification of the probability distributions of the m independent variables 2 random generation of a large number n of samples of the independent variables of the type x1 x2 xm and their use as input to the model for the estimation of as many values of the dependent variable y 3 uncertainty analysis on the value of y and sensitivity analysis of the model to the various input variables in this study the procedure was applied to the combined model ipb spb which demonstrated the best fit to the observed data fig 6 and tab 3 4 5 the model s output is the infiltration rate at time t eq 33 which depends on the initial infiltration rate q0 and the parameters ki and kp as well as on t in turn ki eq 6 depends on σ and on a0 while kp eq 29 depends on c l and a0 an estimate of σ is obtained from eq 12 depending on γs s d and γ0 considering all the previous relations the model s output eq 33 depends on the following eight variables q0 γs s d γ0 a0 c l in the case of soil sediments the variable γs can reasonably be assumed as a constant equal to 2650 kg m3 thus reducing the number of variables to seven for q0 a uniform distribution in the range 0 9 10 5 to 9 10 5 m3 s was assumed the lower limit is the minimum q0 observed in the case study and the upper limit roughly corresponds to the maximum initial infiltration of the horton s model indicated for bare agricultural soils maidment 1993 for d a uniform distribution in the range 0 001 10 3 to 2 10 3 m was assumed to cover all the textural fractions for l a uniform distribution in the range 0 001 to 0 02 m was considered bielders and baveye 1995 for a0 a uniform distribution in the range 0 4 to 0 6 was assumed this range corresponds to bulk densities between 1050 and 1600 kg m3 for s information was retrieved from the sediment concentrations measured at the serlab station in 2008 2018 excluding the samples related to rill erosion di stefano et al 2019 this analysis led to consider for s a normal distribution with mean 0 075 and standard deviation 0 024 for γs considering its high correlation with s a normal distribution with mean 1075 kg m3 and standard deviation 24 kg m3 was considered c was considered proportional to γs assuming a normal distribution with mean 0 028 e standard deviation 0 009 all the normal distributions were truncated in the interval of cumulative probability 0 001 to 0 999 to avoid meaningless values in the generation of random samples a pearson correlation r 0 90 was imposed between the variables s γs and c the number of random samples for each variable n was set to 5000 and the model behaviour was tested at four time steps 300 900 1500 3000 s i 2 results of sensitivity analysis first the uncertainty in the model s output is presented in fig i1 the four plots represent the frequency distribution of the infiltration rate q t at t 300 s a 900 s b 1500 s c

orders of magnitude 10 8 and 10 5 fig i2 shows the results of the sensitivity analysis in terms of pearson correlation coefficients between the individual independent variables and the dependent variable the most relevant variable is the diameter of solid particles d which shows a positive correlation with q t slightly decreasing over time other important variables are s γs and c characterized by a negative correlation with q t slightly increasing over time less evident positive correlations are exhibited by both a0 and l for q0 there is a relevant positive correlation in the initial phase of the process then the correlation becomes lower and not significant the discussion of these results is given in the main text 
2221,in the paper we evaluated some of the prominent mathematical models derived from darcy s law used to describe filtration membrane fouling occurring during the clarification of turbid fluids the fouling can occur by basic mechanisms like surface pore blocking pore constriction obstruction caking or their combination the paper presents a novel application of these models to the infiltration of overland flow into the soil the soil as a porous medium is assumed to be the filter the soil infilling that occurs during structural seal formation is assimilated to the membrane fouling process and the turbid fluid is the flow enriched in fine particles due to the illuviation of the soil particles detached by raindrop impact and overland flow explicit mathematical equations were derived for the dynamics of the free surface area for infiltration the resistance of the infiltration porous medium the infiltration rate the cumulative infiltration volume and the saturated hydraulic conductivity the fluid characteristics and the validation dataset were provided by the serlab soil erosion laboratory 42 59 34 n 12 17 27 e italy of the university of perugia and derives from a sequence of rainfall simulation experiments in a silty clay loam the better fits were obtained by combining the models that simulate the basic mechanisms of the free surface pore area blocking and the increase in the medium resistance due to pore obstruction by infilling fine particles both processes occur during structural crust formation as a model reproducing the fine particles infilling pores both at the surface and at the underneath layer could describe the behaviour of the infiltration data the contribution of this process should be added in modelling the dynamics of structural seal formation and

introduction darcy s law establishes a linear dependence between the filtration flow velocity and the hydraulic gradient between two points of a porous medium the constant of proportionality k s is called saturated hydraulic conductivity and it is typically measured by infiltrometer tests the k s depends on the soil texture granulometry and structure bulk density porosity in an ideal porous medium rigid and unchangeable over time k s should not vary for the soil as a non ideal porous medium reliable estimates of saturated hydraulic conductivity are challenging due to soil properties spatial and temporal variability temporal changes in soil hydraulic and structural properties are essentially due to changes in the pore system during rainfall rousseva et al 2002 and may stem from a variety of mechanisms occurring when raindrops hit the soil surface such as splash slaking dispersion compaction infilling of underlying pores by fine particles and surface sealing mcintyre 1958 chen et al 1980 pagliai et al 1983 torri et al 1987 mapa et al 1986 le bissonnais 1996 rousseva et al 2002 lado et al 2004 souza et al 2014 vinci et al 2020 todisco et al 2022 the citations given above are far from being exhaustive of the literature in the field which is very extensive most previous studies aimed to explain what was observed in quantitative terms particularly relevant is the reduction of saturated hydraulic conductivity k s with increasing rainfall duration armenise et al 2018 and with cumulative rainfall after tillage due to the very unstable pore geometry produced by this operation mapa et al 1986 showed the temporal variability of k s due to deformation and reduction of macropores space resulting from repeated wetting and drying many studies were carried out during research on sealing and crusting e g ndiaye et al 2005 only a few investigations attempted to measure the properties e g thickness bulk density porosity of seals formed during rain and link them to the causes using quantitative relations farres 1978 linked the increase of seal thickness during rain with cumulative rainfall tackett and pearson 1965 related the bulk density increase to cumulative rain exponentially mualen and assouline 1990 suggested that the bulk density is the highest at the soil surface and decreases exponentially with depth to that of undisturbed soil boiffin 1984 observed that the decreases in porosity of the upper soil layer are related to the duration of exposure to rain panini et al 1997 analysing thin soil sections found that most of the reduction in porosity is due to the loss of elongated pores and linked the decay to causative factors such as rainfall energy the equations proposed by panini et al 1997 were integrated by rousseva et al 2002 with information on the dynamics of some other porosity characteristics like the pore size which is crucial for defining hydraulic conductivity in some soil types a reduction in porosity was recorded at the immediate soil surface just after the rainfall started this trend continued throughout the rainfall event this behaviour is compatible with the aggregate breakdown due to rainfall impact splash erosion torri et al 1987 and the so called depositional seal modelled as additional porosity rousseva et al 2002 todisco et al 2022 a recent improvement in the studies on porosity dynamics during wetting drying cycles and the key role played by macropores on k s came from x ray scanning of the soil profile sandin et al 2017 luo et al 2010 kim et al 2010 furthermore armenise et al 2018 used x ray to characterize the relevant stages of seal formation namely aggregate breakdown and particle re organization clearly detecting an abrupt and distinct zone of reduced porosity at the topsoil compatible with the structural seal described in mualem et al 1990 this process is consistent with the well established formation of fine particle bands bielders and baveye 1995 in particular the particles mobilized by impacting drops during rainfall or by share forces exerted by overland flowing water are transported by water vertically in the soil leading to fine particle deposition bands inside the pores this process may largely contribute to the decrease in hydraulic conductivity associated with structural crust formation particle detachment at the soil surface has been extensively studied in relation to structural crust formation and soil erosion however those studies do not provide evidence of vertical particle displacement by water in the soil except those focusing on surface seal development and morphology mualem et al 1990 bielders and baveye 1995 bielders and grymonprez 2010 clearly stated that drop impact is a major contributor to particle mobilization liberating large amounts of silt and clay particles beyond the depth directly affected by drop impact also todisco et al 2022 already pointed out that the effect of the deposition inside the pores of the fine particles transported by the infiltrating water is not separated by the effects of rainfall impact bielders and baveye 1995 linked fine particle eluviation and the thickness of the surface washed in layer to the kinetic energy of rain by linear regressions these suggest that the ultimate cause is the same and unique i e raindrop impacts actually raindrop impact causes aggregate disruption and separation of primary particles from the soil mass runoff keeps the fine particles in suspension and carries them along its path some runoff water infiltrates the soil bringing fine particles into the soil these fine particles will be deposited partially during transport and completely during desiccation after the rainfall has ceased this causes a redistribution of fine particles inside the pore system which is proportional to the amount of detached fine particles hence to the raindrop impacts usually estimated as proportional to rainfall kinetic energy we know that such redistribution cannot easily explain the porosity increase that sometimes occurs after rainfall todisco et al 2022 however the fine particle infilling of pores should be considered as an additional process along with the drop compaction producing the pore decrease during rainfall and structural crust formation the relative importance of the single processes cannot be assessed until they are separately measured let us suppose that a model where infiltration is driven only by fine particles infilling of pores was able to describe the behaviour of the infiltration data in that case there are solid reasons for conducting further research to measure raindrop impact and fine particle infilling processes separately an example of the importance of this process in correctly evaluating infiltration at a basin or slope scale is the infiltration at the interface between clay soil upstream and sandy soil downstream runoff rich in clay infiltrates the sandy soil reducing permeability also extracting pedofunctions for determining the infiltration parameters based on soil characteristics could benefit from a more precise attribution of the causes if we omit the infilling we attribute a different importance to the clay than the other fractions because we have to overestimate the effect of drop impact compaction in more clayey soils as far as we know a mathematical model with explicit equations conceptualising the soil permeability reduction due to the seal formation and the porosity blocking due to illuviated particles deposition in the soil profile has not yet been formulated by mathematical model we mean the description of a process made a priori if this process does not take place then the infiltration will not go according to what is described by the model an explicit model describes what is happening and uses equations that describe the physics of the process this allows an evaluation of the trend due to the single process described this paper attempts to mathematically model the mechanics of vertical transport of soil particles mobilized by drop impact and overland flow by water in the soil profile and the consequent permeability reduction due to structural modification of the soil porosity during rainfall for this purpose we adapted models describing the filtration or clarification of solid particles from fluids in industrial filtration the problem to be addressed is the control of the dynamics of the filter membrane clogging process with the consequent reduction of the volume of filtered fluid in the unit of time hermia 1982 bolton et al 2006 cimini and moresi 2014 ceppitelli and marconi 2018 the conceptual modelling approach assumes that the porous medium is rigid and subject to blockage and permeability reduction due to the process called fouling which is caused by the deposition of particles both inside or on top of the membrane hermia 1982 grace 1956 the fouling models were derived from darcy s law four mechanistic explicit mathematical models hermia 1982 are typically used to describe fouling complete pore blocking assumes that particles seal off pore entrances and prevent flow intermediate pore blocking assumes that a portion of the particles seal off a part of the surface pores and the rest accumulate on top of other deposited particles fig 1 a cake filtration occurs when particles accumulate on the surface of a membrane in a permeable cake of increasing thickness that adds resistance to flow fig 1b standard pore blocking assumes that the porous medium is rigid hence the particles accumulate inside membranes on the walls of straight cylindrical pores fig 1c as particles are deposited the pores become constricted and the membrane s permeability is reduced these models found wide application in the simulation of cross flow microfiltration processes in which the filtered fluid flows tangentially to the membrane bolton et al 2006 developed models that describe the combined fouling mechanism founding explicit equations that relate the pressure to the time during a constant flow operation and the infiltration volume to the time during a constant pressure operation the latter type was here reinterpreted to be applied to the infiltration of overland flow into the erodible soil under saturated conditions the water flow is turbid because it is enriched in fine particles due to the illuviation of the soil particles detached by raindrop impact and overland flowing water during erosion the models cannot simulate the sediment load dynamics and the compaction due to impinging drops as the porous media is assumed to be rigid in analogy with the membrane the fluid characteristics are therefore given as input data and the models are used to describe mathematically three mechanisms that contribute to structural crust formation during wetting under saturated conditions 1 the surface pore obstruction ipb model fig 1a bringing about progressive superficial pore clogging the ipb could be considered the conceptual representation of the progressive soil surface reduction in porosity due to obstruction 2 the deposition at the soil surface model cf fig 1b bringing about an increase in the surface resistance to water infiltration the cf could be considered the conceptual modelling of the deposition of the particles in the soil surface illuviated by water but enabled to enter the soil 3 the subsurface porosity obstruction spb model fig 1c inducing the increase of the media resistance the spb could be considered a conceptual representation of pore clogging and porosity modification in the soil profile due to the deposition of the particles illuviated by water or porosity collapse during wetting the objective of the paper is to evaluate if models where infiltration is driven only by fine particles infilling of pores are able to describe the behaviour of the infiltration data to this end the basic hermia models hermia 1982 and the combined bolton models bolton et al 2006 were tested under constant pressure conditions we derived explicit equations that relate cumulative infiltration volume to time infiltration rate to time and the saturated hydraulic conductivity to time and characteristics of the porous medium and the turbid fluid the accuracy of the models was tested by infiltration data measured in rainfall simulation experiments performed at serlab soil erosion laboratory university of perugia italy in a silty clay loam soil 2 the filtration models 2 1 darcy s law in the context of filtration processes the constant pressure hermia s models hermia 1982 are typically used to describe the membrane fouling that can occur by the deposition of particles inside or on top of the filter these models estimate the flow decline across the membrane during the fouling of the four models typically used to describe fouling only three are considered in this investigation intermediate pore blocking ipb fig 1a assumes that a portion of the particles seal off pore entrances and only considers the reduction of the free surface area for filtration a assuming constant resistance r of the filter medium this model estimates the reduction of a as proportional to the infiltrated volume and the characteristics of the solid particles diameter cake filtration cf fig 1b occurs when particles accumulate on the surface of a membrane in a permeable cake of increasing thickness that adds resistance to flow entrance keeping a constant this model estimates the increasing r as proportional to the infiltrated volume the seal thickness and the fluid density standard pore blocking spb fig 1c assumes that particles accumulate inside the membrane on the walls of straight cylindrical pores affecting the reduction of the pore section and membrane permeability keeping a constant this model estimates the increasing r as proportional to the modified underneath soil thickness and the infiltrated flow concentration bolton et al 2006 combined individual hermia s models to develop new models from now on called bolton s models that described combined fouling mechanisms in particular we used a model where the fouling derives from the reduction of a and the increase of r of the filter medium during constant pressure operation in the following section the reference models of hermia and bolton are described in detail highlighting their characteristics and differences in infiltration process conceptualization and mathematics for further details refer to the papers of hermia 1982 and bolton et al 2006 2 2 hermia s and bolton s models the hermia models hermia 1982 derive from darcy s law which estimates the flow rate q m 3 s as a function of the medium resistance r 1 m and the free surface area a m 2 for infiltration as follow 1 q p a r μ where p n m 2 is the trans membrane pressure that in darcy s equation corresponds to the hydraulic gradient and μ n s m 2 is the solution viscosity three models were tested that are based on different hypotheses on the behaviour of a and r 2 2 1 model assuming variable available surface area a and constant medium resistance r ipb hermia 1982 the ipb model is based on the premise that the particles larger than the pore size seal off the surface and the smaller particles accumulate on top of other deposited particles the model estimates the reduction of the filtration area in time assuming as a constant the resistance r of the filtrating porous medium denoted by q 0 a 0 r 0 the initial data with r r 0 for every t 0 from darcy s equation we get 2 q q 0 a a 0 this model uses a successive approximation method to estimate the reduction of the free surface area let v 1 be the volume that filters in a first interval of time δ t the solid particles contained in it occupy and block a portion of the surface equal to σ v 1 so the free surface is a 1 a 0 σ v 1 to calculate σ see eq 12 let v 2 be the volume filtered in the interval 2 δ t and δ v 2 v 2 v 1 the one filtered in a second interval of time δ t assuming that the suspension is perfectly homogeneous the probability that the particles contained in δ v 2 occupy a portion of the free surface is a 1 a 0 so the increment of the blocked area is σ δ v 2 a 1 a 0 and the free surface is 3 a 2 a 1 σ δ v 2 a 1 a 0 a 1 σ v 2 v 1 a 1 a 0 for successive intervals of time t δt t t δt the free unblocked area at time t δt is 4 a t δ t a t σ v t

integral we have 7 a t a 0 1 k i q 0 t and 8 q t q 0 1 k i q 0 t and integrating again the cumulative infiltration volume with respect to time is 9 v t ln 1 k i q 0 t k i the inverse function t v replaced in a t expresses the reduction of the available area in relation to the infiltrated volume 10 a a 0 e k i v to evaluate σ we follow the reasoning of hermia 1982 let d m be the diameter of the particles assumed to be spherical the volume of the particle will be π d 3 6 the surface projected onto the membrane is approximately equal to π d 2 4 the volume of particles contained in the filtered volume v can be approximated with v γ s s γ 0 where γ s k g m 3 is the density of the turbid fluid γ 0 k g m 3 is the density of the solid particles and s is the mass fraction of the solids in the suspension now the surface of the totality of the particles projected on the filter membrane is 11 σ v 6 π d 3 π d 2 4 v γ s s γ 0 by simplifying the previous equation σ 1 m is given by 12 σ 1 5 γ s s d γ 0 2 2 2 models assuming a variable resistance r and constant available surface area a spb cf hermia 1982 in the following two models spb and cf the increasing of the resistance becomes more important and with the hypothesis of constantly available surface area a a 0 for every t 0 from darcy s equation we get 13 q q 0 r 0 r 2 2 2 1 spb model this model assumes that particles accumulate inside membranes on the walls of straight cylindrical pores thus the pore volume decreases in proportion to the filtered volume the pores are assumed to have a constant diameter and length the radius r m of the pores decreases due to the solid matter that accumulates on the pore walls the reduction of the pore section as a function of the infiltrated volume in hermia 1982 is expressed as follow 14 n 2 π r d r l c d v where n is the number of pores l m the length of each pore supposed to be equivalent to the thickness of the soil layer affected by structural modifications and c the volume of particles deposited per unit of filtered volume integrating with the initial data v r 0 0 we have 15 cv n π l r 0 2 r 2 using the constant pressure poiseuille equation the flow rate can be expressed as a function of the pore radius 16 q n π 2 r 4 p 8 l μ from which using eq 15 we obtain q q 0 r 4 r 0 4 r 2 r 0 2 2 n r 2 π l n r 0 2 π l 2 n r 0 2 π l n r 0 2 π l n r 2 π l n r 0 2 π l 2 1 cv n r 0

with eq 13 the increase in resistance with time can be expressed by 22 r t r 0 1 k p q 0 t 2 2 2 2 2 2 cf model the cake filtration model cf model occurs when particles accumulate on the surface of a membrane in a permeable cake of increasing thickness that adds resistance to flow the total resistance r is the sum of the membrane resistance and the cake resistance in hermia 1982 it is expressed as follows 23 r r 0 1 s α γ v 1 m s r 0 a 0 r 0 1 k c q 0 v with k c s m 6 parameter defined as follows 24 k c s α γ μ a 0 2 p 1 m s where α m k g is the specific coefficient of the resistance of the cake γ k g m 3 is the density of the infiltrated fluid m is the mass ratio and s is the mass fraction of the solids in the turbid fluid from eq 13 we have 25 q dv dt q 0 1 k c q 0 v as a result the cumulative infiltrated volume and the flow rate as a function of the time are respectively 26 v t 1 2 k c q 0 2 t 1 k c q 0 and 27 q t q 0 1 2 k c q 0 2 t combining this equation with eq 13 we have 28 r t r 0 1 2 k c q 0 2 t 2 2 3 combined model ipb spb bolton et al 2006 combining eqs 10 and 22 of the first two previous basic models and assuming that 29 q q 0 a a 0 r 0 r the infiltrated volume as a

process in the soil experiencing overland flow and erosion under porous medium structural modification and crust formation in this case the flow direction is also tangential to the filtering medium similar to cross flow microfiltration in analogy with the filter membrane it is assumed that the porous medium is rigid and that the slurry fluid is the overland flow composed of runoff water and solid particles detached by raindrop impact and sheet flow furthermore in fouling models the slurry fluid s characteristics are known as those of the fluid to be filtered so we must assign a sediment load concentration in the flow and a dimensional characteristic of the sediment these depend on rainfall features e g energy intensity etc runoff characteristics and dynamics and soil and surface properties still the fouling models cannot highlight the direct role of rainfall intensity and energy in sediment load and runoff characteristics besides during rainfall part of the sealing process is caused by surface compaction due to the drop impacting energy fouling models do not reproduce this mechanical process but reproduce the effects on the soil surface of the particles deposition and on the soil profile of the fine particles illuviated by the flow infilling the pores in fact during the soil sealing process occurs the reduction of the porosity area a at the soil surface and an increase in resistance r to infiltration flow both for compaction and for pores obstruction infilling furthermore the porous medium is assumed to be saturated as the fouling models assume constant pressure conditions therefore in our application the combined models are probably more appropriate since they allow us to consider the variations of both a and r we selected the ipb spb and ipb cf model combinations which may be appropriate for estimating the infiltration decline during sealing formation a comparison between the results obtained with the combined models and those with the basic ipb model will highlight the contribution of the spb and cf to the process simulation 3 1 materials the data were provided by the serlab soil erosion laboratory 42 59 34 n 12 17 27 e italy todisco et

length and slope 16 each experiment consists of a sequence of three simulated rainfalls todisco et al 2022 hereinafter i ii and iii carried out over a few weeks before each experiment the soil was manually harrowed to obtain a fine seedbed almost 10 cm deep and with clods smaller than 5 cm the rainfall simulator vergni et al 2018 todisco 2014 todisco et al 2019 installed over the micro plot provides a constant rainfall intensity of about 70 mm h and a kinetic energy rate of 14 5 j mm m2 a wetting before the rainfall simulation ensured constant initial soil moisture the soil water content and the bulk density in the first 0 05 m depth were measured by a gravimetric procedure using a 100 cm3 sampler at the initial and end times of each rainfall structure from motion sfm photogrammetry surveys were conducted to quantify the surface roughness dynamics with the cumulative rainfall and rainfall energy the entire runoff volume v was sampled every 5 min to determine the hydrographs at the down most section of the plots the corresponding infiltration rate q was computed as the difference between the rainfall intensity and the measured runoff the runoff samples were also analysed to obtain the soil sediment concentration dynamics and the particle size distribution for each granulometric component clay fine and coarse silt small medium and coarse sand table 1 the dataset consists of 139 observations of rainfall intensity runoff infiltration rate and sediment concentration the independent variable in each rainfall episode is the initial soil surface condition porous medium structural characteristics which is progressively modified by the drop impact the surface flow and generally by the structural modification of the porous medium therefore the initial value of these characteristics is different for rainfalls i ii and iii for more details on the rainfall simulator see vergni et al 2018 regarding the measurement methodology see vinci et al 2020 todisco et al 2022 todisco et al 2020 vinci et al 2016 in which the experiments were widely described and the data analysed to study the effect of successive rainfalls on the soil surface roughness surface bulk density and porosity infiltration and k s dynamics several statements can be of interest to this work and the parametrization of the filtration models 1 a wetting before the rainfall simulation ensured constant initial soil moisture the soil moisture remained almost constant during the subsequent simulations with end values mean 30 7 and cv 6 7 very close to the initial ones the porous medium can therefore be considered saturated when the simulations start 2 the surface roughness decays exponentially with cumulative rainfall depth and energy in some cases it increases in the dry period between two rainfalls vinci et al 2020 3 the surface bulk density increases with cumulative rainfall depth and energy and sometimes decreases in the dry period between two rainfalls the opposite behaviour is expected for the total porosity derived from the bulk density data todisco et al 2022 4 porosity number of pores and area occupied by pores in the soil surface sorptivity hydraulic conductivity and time to incipient ponding show a decreasing dynamic during the experiments todisco et al 2020 table 2 5 the sediment concentration increases along with the cumulative runoff and infiltration volumes as the experiment progresses table 1 fig 2 6 the runoff coefficient decreases along with the cumulative rainfall and energy from the last tillage as the experiment progresses table 1 models accounting for an overall quick and consistent structural porous medium modification assouline and mualem 2002 panini et al 1997 rousseva et al 2002 further developed in todisco et al 2022 are adequate for the observed behaviour the runoff s stationary and cumulative values increase during the experiment table 1 7 the infiltration data clearly show a dynamic fig 3 with a decrease in the infiltration rate both during the single rainfall episode and during the experiment with the cumulative runoff and infiltration volumes the initial saturated condition assumed at point 1 of the current list is confirmed as the measured infiltration rate is at any time lower than the rainfall rate except for the initial part of the i simulations in e2 fig 3 8 this work cannot highlight the direct role of rainfall intensity and energy in sediment load and runoff characteristics as the database refers to simulations of constant intensity rain the cumulative structural modification occurred on the soil surface with an initial seedbed condition and was caused by three successive rainfalls separated by a period of progressive slow drying of the soil the database fig 2 fig 3 table 1 and table 2 clearly addresses the effects of these causes on the hydrological processes for this reason infiltration models that can account for the structural modification of the filtration medium by deposition of particles and pore blocking with cumulative rainfall i e infiltrated volumes could be appropriate to fit this database 3 2 methods hermia s and bolton s models adaptation to estimate infiltration dynamics under seal formation the formulation of the darcy s equation usually adopted in the infiltration processes in a porous medium is 38 q a 0 k s δ p φ l where φ n m 3 is the fluid specific weight l m is the distance and ks m s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the porous medium comparing the eqs 38 and 1 it is possible to express ks as a function of the variables involved in the hermia s and bolton s models as follows 39 k s t a t φ l a 0 μ r t in soil moisture conditions close to saturation with the prevalence of the gravitational component over the capillary one the δ p can be considered constant and equal to the atmospheric pressure in the ipb model eq 7 represents the reduction of the free surface infiltration in time a t eq 7 combined with eq 39 expresses the decrease of the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s with time as follows 40 k s t a 0 1 k i q 0 t φ l a 0 μ r 0 φ l 1 k i q 0 t μ r 0 where r r 0 μ φ and l are assumed to be constant eqs 8 and 9 express the infiltration rate q t and cumulative volume dynamic v t respectively the q t is a hyperbolic function with respect to time with the parameter ki the ki is defined in eq 6 where σ is expressed by eq 12 in this application the parameters of eq 12 are calculated as follows γ s density of the turbid fluid the turbid fluid is the runoff under erosion composed of water and soil sediments entrapped and transported the γ s is calculated as the density of the fluid mass of fluid the mass of solid per unit of volume density of water measured average concentration of the solids

fluid kg m3 γ 0 solid particle density equal to 2650 kg m3 d diameter of particles that obstruct the surface pores it was assumed to be equal to 0 0002 m in tests i while it decreases to 0 0001 and 0 00005 m in subsequent tests ii and iii respectively these diameters were selected according to the observed dynamics of the sediment granulometry in the rainfall following tillage rainfall i the percentage of sand coarse material in the runoff is low and it tends to increase in the following rainfalls table 2 hence it is possible to suppose that the solid particles in the infiltrated fluid considered complementary to the granulometry in the runoff with regard to the original soil granulometry have initially higher and progressively decreasing diameters a0 was assumed to be 0 55 m2 in test i and then 0 52 and 0 48 m2 in tests ii and iii respectively it is determined based on the measured mean porosity of the soil data indeed it is observed that the surface porosity decreases going from test i to test iii of each experiment table 2 in the spb model eq 22 represents the increase in resistance over time r t the combination of the eqs 22 and 39 expresses the decrease of k s over

the eqs 28 and 39 expresses the decrease of k s with time as follows 42 k s t a 0 φ l a 0 μ r φ l μ r 0 1 2 k c q 0 2 t where a a 0 μ φ and l are assumed to be constant eqs 26 and 27 express the infiltration rate and cumulative volume dynamic respectively the q t is a rational function of the time of degree 1 2 with the parameter k c the parameters of eq 24 for the calculation of kc are estimated starting from the available dataset as follows m ratio between the weights of the wet and dry crusts calculated by dividing the wet and dry weights of the soil samples α specific resistance of the crust m kg calculated as the crust s thickness per unit of volume and per unit of density numerically it is calculated as crust s thickness bulk density the thickness of the crust is assumed to be equal to 0 0007 m in test i while it increases up to 0 0009 and 0 002 m in subsequent tests ii and iii respectively these values are in accordance with previous research armenise et al 2018 the bulk density is assumed to be 1300 kg m3 according to the observed values table 2 γ density of the infiltrated fluid calculated as the average between the density of the runoff and that of water water

and 37 express the infiltration rate q t respectively for ipb spb and ipb cf models while eqs 32 and 36 express the cumulative volumes v t for ipb spb and ipb cf respectively the parameters k i k p and k c are calculated as described above in the ipb spb q t is a rational function of the time with the parameters k i and k p the combination of the eqs 7 22 and 39 expresses the decrease of k s

the k s decreases faster than in the ipb model in the ipb cf q t is a rational function of the time with the parameters k i and k c the combination of the eqs 7 28 and 39 expresses the decrease of k s over time as follows 44 k s t a φ l a 0 μ r φ l μ r 0 1 2 k c q 0 2 t 1 k i q 0 t where μ φ and l are assumed to be constant 4 results the models were applied starting from the measured data the models providing on average the most accurate estimates of the infiltrated rate q t are ipb spb with a mean nush sutcliffe efficiency ns 0 92 in the ii rainfalls and a mean ns 0 74 in all experiments table 3 and ipb cf with a mean ns 0 89 in the iii rainfalls and a mean ns 0 76 in all experiments table 3 among the basic models the ipb is more efficient than the others with the exception of the i rainfall of e1 experiment in general the accuracy of ipb and combined models is lower just after soil surface tillage fig 4 in the i rainfall after tillage as shown in fig 3 the infiltration data are higher than the others clearly indicating that the infiltration volumes are the highest and decrease with the cumulative disturbance exerted by the impacting rainfall in the following rainfall episodes rainfalls ii and iii after tillage the combined models considering both the pore obturation and the increase in the resistance of the porous medium initially tend to underestimate the infiltration rate data while in the final part of the simulation they provide an excellent prediction on the other hand the simple models are more accurate in the first part of the simulation and give an overestimation later on this behaviour is highlighted in the graphs of fig 4 where the combined models are always below the others and very accurate in estimating the infiltration rate in the ii and iii rainfall and in the final part of the i the i simulation of the e3 is to be considered an outlier it provides results very different and apart from all the other trials probably deriving from an error in the measures or a very dry antecedent climatic condition also the models performance is poor in this simulation this trend is confirmed by comparing the estimated and measured final infiltration rates fig 5 b it can be observed that the basic models ibp spb and cf always overestimate the measured data while the prediction of the combined models shows an excellent agreement with the measured data also in these graphs the datum relative to the i simulation of the e3 appears as an evident outlier the final cumulative infiltration volumes calculated as the integral of the infiltration rate are plotted together with the corresponding measured data in fig 5a it is observed that the basic models ipb and spb provide a good estimation mainly due to the compensation between under and overestimations during the simulations indeed the estimated q t sometimes exceeds the measures instead the prediction of combined models slightly underestimates the final cumulative infiltration volumes because they never overestimate the q t fig 6 shows the boxplots representing the results relative to the entire dataset 139 observations of infiltration rate outliers are not given to improve readability the combined models provide the lowest mean absolute percentage error 22 for the ipb spb and 28 for the ipb cf the error in 75 of the cases is lower than 33 and 29 for the ipb spb and the ipb cf respectively furthermore the combined models present a lower variability as quantified by the lower interquartile range and shorter whiskers the ipb among the basic models provides the best performances with an error that in 75 of the cases remains lower than 50 5 discussion the results obtained can be interpreted in the light of the different process conceptualization methods that the tested models use in the ipb model the particles larger than the pore size seal off the surface and the smaller particles accumulate on top of other deposited particles in this way the ipb accounted for the reduction of the area available for infiltration in the soil surface and the dynamic of the area is expressed as a hyperbolic function of the time eq 7 and a decreasing exponential function of the infiltrated volume eq 10 the resistance of the medium is assumed to be constant the ipb model provides good results because the reduction of the surface area of the pores is an actual process occurring during seal formation reallocation of soil particles due to overland flow smoothening of the surface due to soil erosion water with sediment infiltration into the soil profile the estimation of the k i coefficient of the ipb model eqs 6 12 is a crucial step to improve the model s efficiency the k i depends on the diameter d of the solid particles transported and reallocated by the surface overland flow on γ s and s in this application γ s has been estimated from the observed concentration data section 3 2 and in the observed range of the diameter variability table 2 this assumption can be considered acceptable nevertheless a further investigation aimed at determining the functional relationship between γ s and d could give aid to the proper use of this model eq 40 explicitly describes the hyperbolic decrease over time of saturated hydraulic conductivity k s with parameter k i in analogy with the dynamics of the infiltration surface area a described in eq 7 in the spb and cf models only the increase in the resistance of the filter medium is considered and the porous surface area is assumed to be constant these hypotheses are less effective in reproducing the actual dynamics of the process and the estimates of the two models are less accurate fig 6 in spb the resistance dynamic is expressed as a quadratic function of the time eq 22 with parameter k p its increase depends on the reduction in the capillary diameters in the surface layer of thickness l due to the pore infilling by fine particles during wetting in this case l was assumed to be equal to a very superficial layer as for the ipb model the estimation of the k p coefficient eq 19 is a fundamental step the k p depends on the volume of particles deposited c that reduces the pore diameter increasing the resistance to the flow movement in fact k p increases with c and induces a decrease in the infiltration rate the thickness of the soil layer l the other parameter involved in eq 19 for k p has been assumed to be very low following armenise et al 2018 eq 41 explicitly describes the decrease of saturated hydraulic conductivity k s with time as rational function with parameter k p in analogy with the behaviour of the resistance r described in eq 22 according to the mathematical formulation of k s it is expected that the ipb model degree 1 leads to a decrease of the q t slower than spb degree 2 the estimated k s eqs 40 and 41 are mainly influenced by the values of k i and k p in fact the term squared k p 2 q o 2 t 2 4 at the denominator of eq 41 is negligible due to the very small value of q 0 as a consequence in the first rainfall after tillage in which k i k p the ibp infiltration rate is above that of the spb while in the following rainfalls the opposite occurs because the value of k i exceeds that of k p fig 4 in cf the resistance of the soil to the infiltration increases with the thickness of the surface crust and the dynamics is expressed as a square root function of the time eq 28 with the parameter k c the cf model provides the worst results compared with the other basic models the reason can be that in the model a reduction of the surface pore area available for infiltration does not correspond to the crust formation instead in the real process the structural and depositional crust determines both the increase of the surface resistance due to compaction and the reduction of surface pore area due to reallocation the estimation of the k c coefficient of the cf model eq 24 is a crucial step to improve the efficiency of the model an important parameter of k c is the specific coefficient of the resistance of the cake α expressed as a function of the crust thickness and the bulk density assumed according to the observations table 2 other parameters of k c are the viscosity and the density of the infiltrating fluid the problem of determining the viscosity of an overland flow during erosion process is much debated in the scientific community since it is difficult to solve and the data are rare furthermore it should be noted that the runoff data used are those collected at the end of the experimental plot and do not refer to the fluid actually infiltrated whose characteristics are not known but which are with a good approximation assumed to be equal to those of the surface runoff the results agree with those of todisco et al 2022 which highlighted how models that consider the porosity dynamics as a function of the height or energy of the cumulative rain are the most efficient in simulating the infiltration process described by this database the k c values are of the order of 106 according to other applications of hermia s models cimini et al 2014 bolton et al 2006 eq 42 explicitly describes the decrease of k s with time as a rational function with parameter k c in analogy with the behaviour of the resistance r described in eq 28 according to the mathematical formulation of k s the decrease of the infiltration rate simulated by the cf model degree 1 2 is generally slower than that simulated by both ipb and spb hence the corresponding simulated infiltration rate is above that of the ipb and spb except for the first rainfall after tillage where the estimations of the three models are closer fig 4 as it is possible to deduce from what has been commented above the combined models ipb spb and ipb cf provide the best results because they account for both the dynamics of the resistance and the surface pores area in these models all the parameters of the basic models involved are present and maintain the same functional role eqs 43 and 44 explicitly describe the decrease of k s with time as rational functions depending on the dynamics of the area a and resistance r of the corresponding basic models according to the mathematical formulation of k s the decrease of the infiltration rate simulated by combined models ipb spb and ipb cf degree 3 and 3 2 respectively is generally faster than that simulated by basic models hence the corresponding infiltration rate graphs are lower fig 4 the robustness of one of the best performing models i e the combined model ipb spb was evaluated by a global sensitivity analysis this technique aims to determine the relationships between the uncertainty in the independent variables and the uncertainty in the dependent variable cariboni et al 2007 the calculation details and the graphical results are shown in appendix i the results show that the model s output i e the infiltration rate q t eq 33 is always in a physically sound range fig i1 the left shift of the q t distribution with time fig i1 is consistent with the progressive deposition inside the pores of the particles mobilized by impacting drops illuviated by water and transported vertically in the soil profile during structural crust formation the most influential independent variable is the diameter of solid particles d fig i2 which exhibits a positive correlation with q t slightly decreasing with time the fact that d has a determining role in the model output agrees with the processes simulated by the ipb spb model both in the soil profile and in the soil surface the positive correlation is justified by the mathematical formulation of the model eq 33 12 6 and is physically consistent given that the probability of forming occluding layers decreases with increasing particle size other important variables fig i 2 are s γs and c all related to the sediment concentration in the suspension the negative correlation appears consistent with the simulated process since other factors being equal lower infiltration values are expected as the suspension concentration increases the role of the variables a0 and l related to the porosity and thickness of the surface soil layer respectively appears less important than the previous variables fig i 2 at any rate their positive correlation with q t agrees with the role played by these variables in the process the contribution of the initial infiltration rate q0 also appears consistent with the expectations indeed it shows a relatively high positive correlation in the initial phases of the process but subsequently its importance becomes negligible 6 conclusions the paper presents a novel application of the filtration membrane fouling models typically used to describe industrial filtration to the infiltration in the soil experiencing overland flow erosion and crust formation in the filtration models the fouling can occur by various basic mechanisms as the pore blocking pore constriction caking or a combination of the mechanisms of these models in this adaptation the filtration membrane is the porous medium soil assumed to be rigid in analogy with the membrane the slurry fluid is the overland flow enriched in fine particles due to the illuviation of the particles detached by impacting drops and the overland flowing water the models cannot simulate the hydrological process of flow and sediment load dynamics or the surface compaction due to the drop impacting energy as the porous media is assumed to be rigid the models only simulate the deposition of particles in the soil surface and the obstruction of surface and soil profile pores due to turbid fluid infiltration the fluid characteristics are therefore given as input data and in the paper are those of the surface runoff occurring during a rainfall event of given intensity in an erodible soil the principal outcomes of the investigation are 1 explicit mathematical equations were derived for the dynamics during sealing of the free surface area for infiltration a t the resistance of the infiltration porous medium r t the infiltration rate q t the cumulative infiltration volume v t and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks t 2 the combinations of the basic model intermediate pore blocking ipb with the standard pore blocking spb and the cake filtration cf yield the best fit ipb simulates the reduction of the surface pore area a t and the spb and cf model the increase of the porous medium resistance r t this result suggests that models in which infiltration is driven only by fine particle deposition reducing porosity in the soil surface and infilling pores in the soil profile can estimate infiltration data 3 the ipb model alone estimates satisfactorily the infiltration rate observed in the rainfall sequences following the initial tillage this indicates that the dynamics of the soil surface porosity have a very important role in the infiltration process also in a sequence of wetting and drying cycles at the same time the spb and cf models provide less accurate estimations of the observed infiltration rate since they only account for the increase in the resistance of the filter medium and assume a constant pore surface area 4 the most influential independent variable in the process of structural seal formation for porosity obstruction and infilling is the diameter of solid particles d which exhibits a positive correlation with q t slightly decreasing with time the positive correlation is physically consistent given that the probability of forming occluding layers decreases with increasing particle size 5 other important variables are all related to the sediment concentration in the fluid that is negatively correlated with the simulated infiltration values the success of the filtration models suggests that in soils where the silt and clay content is relatively abundant 20 or more the processes driving the infiltration dynamics need to be parameterized separately from the processes immediately due to raindrop impacts in terms of modelling this means that the equations describing the decrease of porosity todisco et al 2022 need an additional cause of variation due to the infilling of fine particles which depends primarily on the presence of silt and clay in the soil matrix and secondarily by the amount of those fine particles suspended in the infiltration water the particle content in the soil matrix should act as a switch excluding the infilling effects in the absence of fine particles let s assume that the porosity decrease is due to the reduction of the effective pore mean diameter d eq 13b in todisco et al 2022 and that d variation is proportional to the sediment load in the infiltrating fluid expressed as the product between the sediment load concentration csl and the infiltration rate q t then is δd k csl q t with k constant csl can be considered proportional to the soil clay content cs and the rainfall energy rainen csl cs k1 rainen with k1 constant thus in a first approximation the infiltration rate is introduced into the equation for determining the diameter and the effective porosity for accounting for the infiltration rate itself the soil clay content cs is not a prerequisite for getting clay into the soil neither is it the proper value to use during erosion on a slope with just one soil horizon topping over all of it the clay content in the suspended sediment is clay enriched with respect to the soil clay fraction the enrichment depends on the amount of sediment entrained into the runoff by runoff and drop impact but varies through an enrichment function that depends on the different particle sedimentation velocities if the soil along the slope varies in grain size characteristics then the sediment load entering the downslope soil has its own clay fraction built as described above that clay fraction will be changed accordingly to the contribution of clay by the downslope soil detachment and sedimentation and the loss sedimentation of the clay contributed by the upslope soil as an example takes two extreme soils the upslope one with 100 clay and the downslope one with 100 sand the sediment load will be all clay at the beginning of the downslope soil the clay contribution from the downslope soil will be nil hence the length necessary for all the clay to sediment will be affected by infiltrating water bringing clay into the pore system the needed approach is very similar to the one for pollutants with the difference that here there is a source and an extinction phase of the clay phosphorous is usually transported with clay hence the mathematics applied to the behavior of particular pollutants could be used lastly it should be noted that the data used in the analysis refer to the runoff collected at the end of the experimental plot and not to the fluid actually infiltrated whose characteristics are unknown it was assumed presumably with a good approximation that the surface runoff and the infiltrating fluid characteristics are the same further developments of the study could be carried out on datasets deriving from laboratory experiments in which the infiltrated fluid can be collected and analysed in such a way as to determine more accurately the composition and characteristic diameter of the sediment load illuviated also with reference

sensitivity analysis for the ipb spb model the sensitivity analysis of a generic model of the type i 1 y f x i i 1 m where y is the generic dependent variable xi the i th independent variable and m the number of independent variables is carried out following a few successive steps which can be summarized as follows 1 identification of the probability distributions of the m independent variables 2 random generation of a large number n of samples of the independent variables of the type x1 x2 xm and their use as input to the model for the estimation of as many values of the dependent variable y 3 uncertainty analysis on the value of y and sensitivity analysis of the model to the various input variables in this study the procedure was applied to the combined model ipb spb which demonstrated the best fit to the observed data fig 6 and tab 3 4 5 the model s output is the infiltration rate at time t eq 33 which depends on the initial infiltration rate q0 and the parameters ki and kp as well as on t in turn ki eq 6 depends on σ and on a0 while kp eq 29 depends on c l and a0 an estimate of σ is obtained from eq 12 depending on γs s d and γ0 considering all the previous relations the model s output eq 33 depends on the following eight variables q0 γs s d γ0 a0 c l in the case of soil sediments the variable γs can reasonably be assumed as a constant equal to 2650 kg m3 thus reducing the number of variables to seven for q0 a uniform distribution in the range 0 9 10 5 to 9 10 5 m3 s was assumed the lower limit is the minimum q0 observed in the case study and the upper limit roughly corresponds to the maximum initial infiltration of the horton s model indicated for bare agricultural soils maidment 1993 for d a uniform distribution in the range 0 001 10 3 to 2 10 3 m was assumed to cover all the textural fractions for l a uniform distribution in the range 0 001 to 0 02 m was considered bielders and baveye 1995 for a0 a uniform distribution in the range 0 4 to 0 6 was assumed this range corresponds to bulk densities between 1050 and 1600 kg m3 for s information was retrieved from the sediment concentrations measured at the serlab station in 2008 2018 excluding the samples related to rill erosion di stefano et al 2019 this analysis led to consider for s a normal distribution with mean 0 075 and standard deviation 0 024 for γs considering its high correlation with s a normal distribution with mean 1075 kg m3 and standard deviation 24 kg m3 was considered c was considered proportional to γs assuming a normal distribution with mean 0 028 e standard deviation 0 009 all the normal distributions were truncated in the interval of cumulative probability 0 001 to 0 999 to avoid meaningless values in the generation of random samples a pearson correlation r 0 90 was imposed between the variables s γs and c the number of random samples for each variable n was set to 5000 and the model behaviour was tested at four time steps 300 900 1500 3000 s i 2 results of sensitivity analysis first the uncertainty in the model s output is presented in fig i1 the four plots represent the frequency distribution of the infiltration rate q t at t 300 s a 900 s b 1500 s c and 3000 s d deriving from the 5000 randomly generated samples of the independent variables a left shift of the q t distribution with increasing time is evident most estimated values range between the orders of magnitude 10 8 and 10 5 fig i2 shows the results of the sensitivity analysis in terms of pearson correlation coefficients between the individual independent variables and the dependent variable the most relevant variable is the diameter of solid particles d which shows a positive correlation with q t slightly decreasing over time other important variables are s γs and c characterized by a negative correlation with q t slightly increasing over time less evident positive correlations are exhibited by both a0 and l for q0 there is a relevant positive correlation in the initial phase of the process then the correlation becomes lower and not significant the discussion of these results is given in the main text 
2222,spatial heterogeneity in hydrological responses is an important element in urbanized watersheds one of the main challenges in simulating urban hydrology is the lack of layered information and knowledge of the true infiltration potential of stormwater infrastructure systems in this study changes in the infiltration characteristics of three green infrastructures gis with and without underground barriers were simulated during a designed rain event in xiamen china using a layered one dimensional infiltration model the variations in the maximum infiltration rate mir and cumulative infiltration ci for permeable pavements vegetative swales and rain gardens were found to differ in response to 204 scenarios of pervious material thickness even though they were linearly correlated comparisons between the gis with and without barriers revealed that the mir was almost unchanged while ci varied considerably with the depth to the impervious layer to explore the impacts of barriers on infiltration potential simulations with depths to the impervious layer from 700 to 1000 mm were compared we statistically evaluated the infiltration potential with all possible scenarios for the gis identifying the potential impacts of infiltration processes beneath gi can be beneficial in urban stormwater management keywords green infrastructures hydrus 1d infiltration rate cumulative

stormwater management in china wang et al 2018 xia et al 2017 severe urban flood disasters are closely related to an increase in the coverage of impervious surfaces bell et al 2016 hellies et al 2018 however conversion of impervious to pervious surfaces while ignoring the complicated subsurface environments is not an optimum solution at the city scale because complicated subsurface environments

challenge and research interest regarding urban hydrology are quantifying the effect of gi design and subsurface properties on overall infiltration potential fidal and kjeldsen 2020 previous studies

conservation service curve number rassam et al 2018 at a plot scale of 100 m2 or less the hydrological behavior of infiltration based gis such as permeable pavements pp vegetative swales vs and rain gardens rg have received an increasing attention relative to single layer gis from researchers hou et al 2019 li et al 2020 liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b factors that influence the infiltration characteristics of these gis include the types of surface paving materials the hydraulic and physical properties of the soil and the vertical distribution of the surface and subsurface layers the infiltration process of the gis can be influenced by their flux and cumulative capacity emerson and traver 2008 gao et al 2018 the infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration of the gis are important factors for urban stormwater management particularly during extreme rain events al janabi et al 2019 phillips et al 2019 moreover infiltration based gis allow infiltration potential to be quantified and have become an essential strategy for reducing runoff and mitigating flooding risks worldwide bonneau et al 2021 most studies have focused on the impacts of the coverage level of gi on

distribution of artificial facilities and runoff reduction effects dhakal and chevalier 2017 elga et al 2015 however subsurface water processes are rarely used for designing gi bhaskar et al 2016 the underlying surface of urban environments has been extensively disturbed by human infrastructure when compared with natural conditions leading to high levels of spatial heterogeneity in infiltration characteristics bonneau et al 2017 previous studies have reported the impacts of surface type filling material and underground structures on infiltration potential and effectiveness for gi alaoui et al 2018 ren et al 2020 wang et al 2021 wu et al 2019 the results obtained by cipolla et al 2016 demonstrated that infiltration potential is mostly affected by the physical properties of the infrastructure rather than by antecedent dry weather time or pavement age the parameters of the soil properties used for simulating the infiltration process are derived from laboratory and empirical values rawls et al 1983 as the practice of using infiltration based gi becomes increasingly common it is critical to quantitatively assess infiltration potential in urban landscapes newcomer et al 2014 tu and traver 2019 to improve the accuracy of infiltration potential simulations and facilitate improved performance of gi it is necessary to analyze the vertical layers with heterogeneous soils to reflect the actual physical properties huo et al 2020 yang et al 2020 as well as consider the impact of impervious barriers such as underground roofs and storage units within a depth of 1000 mm below the urban surface bonneau et al 2018 le coustumer et al 2012 rodriguez et al 2008 it is important to determine if the vertical distribution of layered materials and impervious barriers affect infiltration characteristics and to explore the best option to quantify the threshold of infiltration potential for multi type gi a better understanding of the infiltration process and its infiltration potential for stormwater management beneath gi is an important step toward sustainable development in urban areas in this study we aimed to 1 simulate and analyze the effects of pervious material types and vertical layer thickness on infiltration characteristics using a one dimensional hydrological model 2 compare the variation in infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration with different burial depths of impervious barriers for pp vs and rg 3 quantify the thresholds of infiltration potential for infiltration based gis with hypothetical scenarios the novelty of this work lies in its evaluation of the overland flow outcomes from the perspective of the subsurface 2 methodology 2 1 study site the sub district of xinyang main canal watershed located in the haicang district of western xiamen china was selected as the study area fig 1 this sub district was chosen because of the high proportion of artificial surfaces in the watershed and the availability of data on the gis for urban hydrologic modeling with a total area of 24 9 km2 the sub district has eight land cover types including ocean area artificial surfaces water bodies wetlands shrublands grasslands forests and cultivated lands based on land cover data with a 30 m resolution mnr 2020 and satellite imagery extracted from the national geomatics center of china ngcc 2021 land cover classification shows that more than 70 of the sub district is urbanized fig 1a with two high density communities xin an and xiayang fig 1b 2 2 data field measurements were conducted to examine the physical properties of the soil and depths to the impervious layer as well as to collect infiltration process data during the rainy season july september from 2017 to 2020 the soils underlying the xinyang sub district include silty clay sandy clay silty sand and artificial loam permeable pavements vs and rg are three infiltration based gis that have been widely implemented in this urban area the main geometric information including depth of the soil profile and impervious barrier the number of materials and the distribution of vertical layers for these three types of gis was obtained from in situ observations fig a1 and local standards xmcb 2016 we observed the vertical distribution of pervious materials and impervious barriers through field excavations within 1000 mm fig 1 above this depth both infiltration characteristics and runoff mechanisms may change infiltration characteristics of the three types of gis were measured during the rainy season july september at 24 locations of the xinyang sub district moret fernández et al 2021 fig 1b these experimental sites were chosen because they were typical artificial surfaces and located in areas influenced by human activities fig 1b observations of the infiltration rate were made using a double ring infiltrometer dj in12 w at three baseline sites for each of the infiltration based gis fig 1b with data being recorded at 10 min intervals observations of saturated hydraulic conductivity of the gis were recorded using a guelph permeameter eca tr09 as the infiltration process is difficult to observe during rainfall events data on saturated hydraulic conductivity at nine sites three groups for each gi and 12 sites four groups for each gi were used to calibrate and validate the simulation performance of the infiltration model respectively 2 3 modeling methods 2 3 1 layered infiltration model the hydrus 1d v 4 04 model was used in this study to simulate water flow in variably saturated porous media on the layered gis during a rain event šimůnek et al 2016 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 the hydrus 1d model is considered an effective tool for solving the richards equation in one dimensional finite element models li et al 2020 this model can be coupled with others for rainfall runoff simulation of the gis with multiple layers baek et al 2020 it is a powerful and wide ranging model for urban catchments because of the detailed description of the pervious layers and the accurate reflection of physical processes infiltration simulations in a vertical direction and the overland flow from the gis were conducted using hydrus 1d šimůnek and nimmo 2005 in this study the single porosity model van genuchten mualem with an air entry value of 2 cm was used to represent flow in the porous media rassam et al 2018 since this study mainly analyzed the hydrological effects of vertical spatial structure at the facility scale it is assumed that rainfall and infiltration processes are not affected by horizontal flow exchange li et al 2018 winston et al 2016 found lateral flow to be the dominant pathway providing volume reduction in three bioretention cells constructed in low permeability soils the unsaturated water flow was then described using the one dimensional richards equation 1 θ t z k h z 1 s where θ is the volumetric moisture content l3l 3 h is the water pressure head l s is the sink term l3l 3t 1 and k is the unsaturated hydrologic conductivity lt 1 described by the function 2 k h z k s z k r h z where kr is the relative hydraulic conductivity and ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 2 3 2 initial and boundary conditions the van genuchten mualem model can flexibly handle different flow boundaries and conceptualize homogeneous and heterogeneous soil structures li et al 2020 the number of materials representing the three types of gis pp vs and rg was divided into 3 4 and 5 layers respectively table 1 the water hysteresis and root water uptake were neglected the effects of layer thickness and the depths of impervious barriers on infiltration and runoff during a rain event were studied an atmospheric boundary for upper boundary conditions with surface layers was applied at the gis and the seepage face was set as the lower boundary condition the pressure heads were considered the initial condition and were set to linearly increase with depth a seepage face boundary acts as a zero pressure head boundary when the bottom boundary node is saturated and as a no flux boundary when it is unsaturated brunetti et al 2016 the pervious layers were assumed to be homogeneous and potential evapotranspiration was excluded because the input condition was a rain event lasting less than 12 h the observation point was set at the top of the flow domain z 0 2 3 3 model calibration and validation the observed and simulated value of the infiltration rate and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the gis were used for performance analysis and model calibration validation five parameters of soil hydraulic properties residual water content for θr saturated water content for θs hydraulic shape parameter for α hydraulic parameter for n and saturated hydraulic conductivity for ks were considered in each layer which were used as calibration parameters therefore the model was calibrated using infiltration process data for the three gis from the baseline sites the initial values for each vertical layer of these five parameters were calculated using the neural network prediction pedotransfer tool rassam et al 2018 this was built into the model within the known texture and bulk density ranges jian et al 2021 the observed ks data of the gis from the nine experimental sites fig 1b were used for calibrating the model by adjusting the ks values in each vertical layer based on observations from experimental sites and previous studies for local gi in xiamen cheviron and coquet 2009 mei et al 2020 the corresponding values for the soil hydraulic parameters were calibrated table 3 validation of the model was performed using the observed ks data from 12 experimental sites fig 1b the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse eq 3 nash and sutcliffe 1970 and determination coefficient r 2 eq 4 are common indicators of model performance for evaluating the goodness of fit between simulated and observed values and were used for the infiltration model evaluation as follows 3 nse 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 4 r 2 i 1 n s i s o i o i 1 n s i s 2 i 1 n o i o 2 2 where si is the simulated value at the ith time step oi is the observed value at the ith time step s is the mean value of the simulated data and o is the mean value of the observed data if nse 0 5 and r 2 0 5 the simulated data can be deemed acceptable the closer the nse and r 2 values are to 1 the better the performance of the model in this study if the nse and r 2 values were greater than 0 6 and 0 8 respectively the simulation performance was considered good 2 3 4 simulation scenarios several key factors such as infrastructure type vertical layer distribution material thickness and impervious barrier position were studied based on the model characteristics the ranges of these factors were determined following the field observation fig 1b and the requirements specified in the sponge city construction technical guide low impact development rainwater system construction trial mohurd 2014 in this study in situ digging and observation results showed that the most common layered structures and thicknesses of the three gis were selected as baseline scenarios table 1 the baseline scenarios were used to compare gis without an impervious barrier the effects of the gis on stormwater infiltration and overland flow are mediated by microtopographic reestablishment within 1000 mm bruland and richardson 2005 and local groundwater levels 500 5500 mm a total depth profile of 1000 mm was used as the vertical description range for the analysis of the infiltration characteristics the observed physical properties of the vertical layers and the position of waterproof infrastructure for the three gis were input into hydrus 1d to simulate the infiltration process the materials and thickness of the layers obtained from the field sites where typical gis are located were used in the baseline simulations the ranges of variation in layer thicknesses measured from the experimental sites were used in the designed scenarios table 1 the burial depth of the impervious barrier was 700 mm below the surface according to facilities design manuals xmcb 2016 and field surveys fig a1 we used a change step of 10 mm for the gi layers up to a thickness of 200 mm and a change step of 50 mm for those over 200 mm thick the thickness of the last layer is dynamically fluctuated with the thickness of the other layers to ensure that the total depth of each gi remains 1000 mm the impacts of impervious barriers at different burial depths on infiltration characteristics were evaluated by comparing the resulting mir and ci to that of baseline simulations while infiltration based gis are typically designed to meet a 5 10 year return period storms fu et al 2020 gong et al 2021 here we use a 20 year storm to capture the extreme events that can occur in southeastern coastal parts of china xmcb 2016 the data from the design rain event with duration of 720 min and total rainfall depth of 240 3 mm were input and compiled from the xiamen meteorological station and the rainfall intensity formula liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b mohurd 2016 5 q 1123 95 1 0 759 lg p t 6 3 0 582 t 6 3 0 582 where q is the rainfall intensity l s hm2 t is the design duration of the rainfall min and p is the return period year for the scope of application 180 min t 1440 min 3 results 3 1 infiltration model evaluation historical observation datasets during rainfall events at the site scale are very limited measuring the variation in infiltration rates during rain events is difficult because of inadequate station densities therefore the hydraulic parameters of layered heterogeneous soils were calibrated and validated against the available data from the field infiltration experiments we observed and acquired the variation in infiltration rates for the three gis with a constant pressure head of 10 cm which infiltrated a total of 94 2 278 3 mm the variations in the observed and simulated infiltration at the three gis are shown in fig 2 the model calibration for the infiltration rate based on field infiltration experiments resulted in nse and r 2 values of 0 74 to 0 94 and 0 87 to 0 94 respectively to improve the calibration results another round of calibration based on the observed ks was performed and the key parameters were determined for each vertical layer where the nse and r 2 values of ks were greater than 0 6 and 0 8 respectively these results indicate that the layered infiltration model is suitable for estimating infiltration potential in this study table 2 shows the nse and r 2 of ks in the calibration and verification period the verified values of the key parameters for the layered infiltration model with heterogeneous soils are shown in table 3 3 2 infiltration characteristics under different layer thicknesses 3 2 1 permeable pavement the maximum infiltration rate mir and cumulative infiltration ci of pp during the designed rain event duration of 720 min and return period of 20 years were simulated at different layer thicknesses fig 3 the results of the 72 scenarios comprised three types of permeable bricks 60 mm 70 mm and 80 mm each of which contained six crushed stones and four permeable concretes while we simulated changed to depth of each of the five layers of pp table 1 the results were primarily sensitive to depth changes across three of these layers thus we show results across these three layers only fig 3 shows that as the permeable brick thickness increased the mir and ci of the pp also increased owing to the higher porosity of the crushed stones than that of other pervious materials more space can be provided to promote the infiltration flux for this layer regarding the variations in the mir fig 3a and ci fig 3b for the 24 scenarios thicker crushed stones or permeable concrete yielded greater mir and ci values for the pp the mir and ci simulated for 80 mm permeable brick 150 mm crushed stone and 180 mm permeable concrete were 1 3 and 1 1 times higher than for 60 mm permeable brick 100 mm crushed stone and 150 mm permeable concrete respectively 3 2 2 vegetative swale for vertical layers of crushed stone and planting soil with 66 thickness scenarios variation in the mir and ci of the vs showed similar patterns to those of the pp fig 4 while we simulated changed to depth of each of the four layers of vs table 1 the results were primarily sensitive to depth changes across two of these layers thus we show results across these two layers only compared with the results from the pp the variable ranges of infiltration characteristics were different due to their positive relationship with the thickness of the crushed stone and the planting soil the highest infiltration characteristics found from the 200 mm crushed stone and the 450 mm planting soil were 45 8 mm h for the mir and 205 24 mm for ci respectively fig 4 this is compared to the lowest simulation with mir and ci values of 24 37 mm h and 166 02 mm a difference of 1 9 and 1 2 times respectively 3 2 3 rain garden the general trends in the variation of the mir and ci for rg were similar to those for pp and vs with 66 thickness scenarios fig 5 while we simulated changed to depth of each of the three layers of rg table 1 the results were primarily sensitive to depth changes across two of these layers the thickness of the artificial fill was positively correlated with the infiltration characteristics but increases in planting soil thickness led to a decline in the mir and ci these results are due to the assessment range being limited to 1000 mm and the remaining crushed stone layer having a negative relationship with planting soil and artificial fill therefore the infiltration characteristics were still positively correlated with the thickness of the crushed stone the rg layer thickness had little effect on the resulting range of mir and ci 3 3 impact of depth to impervious layer 3 3 1 variation in maximum infiltration rate a comparison between the simulations with and without the impervious barriers of the three gis showed no noticeable differences in the mir at 700 mm burial depths fig 6 results show little effect on the mir for the gis when the burial depth of the impervious barrier was over 700 1000 mm fig 6 a shows that the extent of the depth to the impervious layer that affected the mir for ppb vsb and rgb where b indicates the presence of a barrier was between 700 mm and 800 mm for the δmir of the three gis without an impervious barrier in fig 6 b the reduction in the mir was 10 mm h various depths to the impervious layer had the most pronounced impact on rgb with a mean reduction of 1 24 mm the linear fitting curves between δmir and depths to the impervious layer 700 800 mm for ppb vsb and rgb were plotted in fig 6 c in this study functional relationships were used to calculate and analyze the variation in the mir of the gis alongside other scenarios 3 3 2 variation in cumulative infiltration the effects of depths to the impervious layer on infiltration characteristics are usually ignored in the design and implementation of stormwater control systems phillips et al 2019 the variation in ci with different depths to the impervious layer 700 1000 mm were simulated and analyzed in fig 7 a the minimum ci of ppb vsb and rgb found from the 700 mm depth to the impervious layer simulations were 73 9 mm 85 3 mm and 95 3 mm respectively these results demonstrate that the ci of the gis increased with depth to the impervious layer fig 7 b shows the reduction effects of impervious barriers on cis compared with the typical gis the mean ci simulated with various scenarios of depths to the impervious layer decreased by 42 5 73 7 mm for ppb 17 4 23 3 mm for vsb and 35 5 73 1 mm for rgb therefore the presence of an impervious barrier had the most significant impact on the variation in ci in ppb and pp systems while the vsb and vs systems had the least pronounced response the three curves in fig 7 c represent the functional relationships between the burial depth and reduction in ci these results express the impact of depth to the impervious layer on the infiltration characteristics of the gis which can provide a basis for subsequent infiltration potential assessments 3 4 infiltration potential assessment fig 8 depicts the infiltration characteristics of pp vs rg ppb vsb and rgb with all possible scenarios the mir and ci of the six gis ranged from 23 6 to 46 6 mm h and 72 4 to 206 1 mm respectively based on statistical results 27 9 of the infiltration based gis with mir greater than 37 8 mm h and ci greater than 135 7 mm for the gis without an impervious barrier less than 3 of the pp 37 9 of the vs and all rg exceeded the mean level of actual infiltration rate and volume however with the influence of an impervious barrier the proportion of ppb vsb and rgb with high infiltration potential decreased by 2 5 0 7 and 53 3 respectively 3 5 overland flow response to infiltration potential to investigate the hydrologic runoff mechanisms of infiltration based gis with different mir and ci the infiltration process and overland flow of eight gis during a rain event were calculated using hydrus 1d overland flow refers to surface flow of the gis in this study using the design rain event approach described in 2 3 4 the required time variable input data are rainfall intensity total rainfall depth and hyetograph a time step of 60 sec is used for the hyetograph input and runoff outcome overland flow can be calculated subsequently as the difference between the rainfall intensity and infiltration rate both instantaneous infiltration rate cumulative infiltration and overland flow are stored as output and displayed in fig 9 table a5 in the supplementary information shows the infiltration potential facility type and vertical profile information of the eight gis fig 9 shows the maximum infiltration rate mir cumulative infiltration ci overland flow and cumulative overland flow depth for the eight gis with different mir and ci since the rainfall intensity was less than the mir in the initial 300 min fig 9a no runoff appeared on the surface for all the gis fig 9c then as the rainfall intensity increased and the infiltration rate decreased the overland flow also increased as shown in fig 9 most of the overland flow appeared during the 300 420 min period even though the time of flow generation is consistent with the decaying order of the infiltration rate fig 9 b and d show the cumulative depth of infiltration and runoff respectively furthermore comparing the cumulative infiltration and overland flow process of the typical gis can establish the relationship between infiltration potential and runoff mechanisms fig 9 in particular offers illustrative evidence of both hortonian and non hortonian overland flow for gi no 1 gi no 2 gi no 5 and gi no 6 facilities with lower ci the infiltration depth did not change when the overland flow appeared therefore the rainfall runoff was generated principally by the saturation excess mechanism non hortonian overland flow in contrast the other facilities gi no 3 gi no 4 gi no 7 and gi no 8 with higher ci the rainfall runoff was driven by the infiltration excess mechanism hortonian overland flow the results of overland flow suggest that the gis gi no 1 gi no 4 with higher mir outperform those with lower infiltration potential in peak flow reduction under the same rainfall conditions fig 9c however it is observed that cumulative overland flow results from gis with lower ci are generally higher than those from gi no 3 gi no 4 gi no 7 and gi no 8 facilities fig 9d 4 discussion assessing the infiltration potential of gi is key for urban hydrological modeling and stormwater management ebrahimian et al 2021 van der meij et al 2018 wang et al 2020 as it aids in identifying potential impacts of infiltration processes on stormwater controls and in understanding the mechanisms of rainfall runoff responses in urban hydrology in this study changes in layer thickness showed different trends in response to infiltration characteristics for the three typical gis this can be explained by considering the effects of vertical distribution and artificial construction on physical properties it is likely that the range of variation in the mir and ci with layer thicknesses during the designed rain event could be 20 mm h and 39 mm respectively indicating that the infiltration potential of the vs is dependent on the thickness of the planting soil and crushed stone fig 4 similarly the infiltration potential of pp increased as expected with the thickness of the permeable brick permeable concrete and crushed stone across the 72 scenarios fig 3 there was no noticeable change in the mir or ci for the rg during 66 scenarios due to the high actual flux and infiltration capacity fig 5 these results indicate that a linear relationship exists between infiltration potential and layer thickness and that the enhanced infiltration effect could be demonstrated and detected hellies et al 2018 kidmose et al 2015 therefore the interaction between layer thickness and infiltration potential based on the layered infiltration model is important and an artificial design on vertical layers may improve the overall standard of the gis for stormwater control a study by fidal and kjeldsen 2020 has confirmed that the infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration directly affects rainfall runoff processes regarding the impervious barriers at 1000 mm below the surface the ci changed dynamically with depth to the impervious layer and was dependent on the water storage conditions of the gis fig 7 in addition to the mir that was more stable at various depths fig 6 an impervious layer or roof may limit the maximum infiltration capacity by blocking the flow path in vertical space as reported for the variation of infiltration characteristics for the three typical gis with different depths of impervious barriers therefore shallow underground facilities with a waterproof construction will result in losses in stormwater storage capacity which can make the gis ineffective as opposed to making the losses in stormwater storage capacity ineffective thus the vertical layers with and without impervious barriers should be considered key in the simulation of urban hydrological processes chen et al 2021 an important challenge in urban hydrology is quantifying the effect of artificial infrastructure on infiltration processes sage et al 2020 all possible scenarios for the gi types presented here were simulated with hydrus 1d and statistically evaluated for the infiltration potential of the gis according to the practice types layer thicknesses and depths to the impervious layer the effectiveness of the gis has improvement for reducing runoff and mitigating flooding fig 8 based on this study impervious barrier effects could be considered as solutions for infrastructure optimization through the adequate investigation of ppb and vsb linear relationships relating to changes in the mir and ci with depth to impervious barriers were identified and have potential utility in allowing assessments of infiltration performance of infiltration based gi 5 conclusions the perviousness of underlying urban surfaces is highly heterogeneous and these surfaces have complex artificial infrastructures changes in urban environments are related to the vertical spatial distribution of permeable layered materials and impermeable facilities in this study we quantified the impacts of the types and thickness of pp vs and rg on simulated infiltration characteristics within a depth of 1000 mm below the urban surface we compared simulations with and without impervious barriers and identified the linear relationships of the mir and ci with depth finally the infiltration potential of the gis was configured and evaluated in the study site based on the calculated predictions for all possible scenarios the results show that the infiltration characteristics of the gis are highly sensitive to the vertical structures of both the layer thicknesses and depths to the impervious layer moreover less than 30 of the gis with infiltration potential exceeded the average level of mir and ci and more than 70 of the gis could change their own overland flow mechanism by optimizing the vertical structure considering our results it is suggested to incorporate the heterogeneous layered properties of the gis and detailed perviousness assessments into urban hydrological simulations at the catchment scale the influence of vegetation cover root systems and water content on infiltration characteristics should be further studied furthermore changing the thickness of the vertical layers and the layout of gray green infrastructure can mitigate urban flooding more effectively such modifications could improve our understanding of rainfall runoff mechanisms in urban areas and help to better manage flooding risks credit authorship contribution statement xiaoran fu conceptualization methodology software validation investigation

2222,spatial heterogeneity in hydrological responses is an important element in urbanized watersheds one of the main challenges in simulating urban hydrology is the lack of layered information and knowledge of the true infiltration potential of stormwater infrastructure systems in this study changes in the infiltration characteristics of three green infrastructures gis with and without underground barriers were simulated during a designed rain event in xiamen china using a layered one dimensional infiltration model the variations in the maximum infiltration rate mir and cumulative infiltration ci for permeable pavements vegetative swales and rain gardens were found to differ in response to 204 scenarios of pervious material thickness even though they were linearly correlated comparisons between the gis with and without barriers revealed that the mir was almost unchanged while ci varied considerably with the depth to the impervious layer to explore the impacts of barriers on infiltration potential simulations with depths to the impervious layer from 700 to 1000 mm were compared we statistically evaluated the infiltration potential with all possible scenarios for the gis identifying the potential impacts of infiltration processes beneath gi can be beneficial in urban stormwater management keywords green infrastructures hydrus 1d infiltration rate cumulative

al 2018 ren et al 2020 wang et al 2021 wu et al 2019 the results obtained by cipolla et al 2016 demonstrated that infiltration potential is mostly affected by the physical properties of the infrastructure rather than by antecedent dry weather time or pavement age the parameters of the soil properties used for simulating the infiltration process are derived from laboratory and empirical values rawls et al 1983 as the practice of using infiltration based gi becomes increasingly common it is critical to quantitatively assess infiltration potential in urban landscapes newcomer et al 2014 tu and traver 2019 to improve the accuracy of infiltration potential simulations and facilitate improved performance of gi it is necessary to analyze the vertical layers with heterogeneous soils to reflect the actual physical properties huo et al 2020 yang et al 2020 as well as consider the impact of impervious barriers such as underground roofs and storage units within a depth of 1000 mm below the urban surface bonneau et al 2018 le coustumer et al 2012 rodriguez et al 2008 it is important to determine if the vertical distribution of layered materials and impervious barriers affect infiltration characteristics and to explore the best option to quantify the threshold of infiltration potential for multi type gi a better understanding of the infiltration process and its infiltration potential for stormwater management beneath gi is an important step toward sustainable development in urban areas in this study we aimed to 1 simulate and analyze the effects of pervious material types and vertical layer thickness on infiltration characteristics using a one dimensional hydrological model 2 compare the variation in infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration with different burial depths of impervious barriers for pp vs and rg 3 quantify the thresholds of infiltration potential for infiltration based gis with hypothetical scenarios the novelty of this work lies in its evaluation of the overland flow outcomes from the perspective of the subsurface 2 methodology 2 1 study site the sub district of xinyang main canal watershed located in the haicang district of western xiamen china was selected as the study area fig 1 this sub district was chosen because of the high proportion of artificial surfaces in the watershed and the availability of data on the gis for urban hydrologic modeling with a total area of 24 9 km2 the sub district has eight land cover types including ocean area artificial surfaces water bodies wetlands shrublands grasslands forests and cultivated lands based on land cover data with a 30 m resolution mnr 2020 and satellite imagery extracted from the national geomatics center of china ngcc 2021 land cover classification shows that more than 70 of the sub district is urbanized fig 1a with two high density communities xin an and xiayang fig 1b 2 2 data field measurements were conducted to examine the physical properties of the soil and depths to the impervious layer as well as to collect infiltration process data during the rainy season july september from 2017 to 2020 the soils underlying the xinyang sub district include silty clay sandy clay silty sand and artificial loam permeable pavements vs and rg are three infiltration based gis that have been widely implemented in this urban area the main geometric information including depth of the soil profile and impervious barrier the number of materials and the distribution of vertical layers for these three types of gis was obtained from in situ observations fig a1 and local standards xmcb 2016 we observed the vertical distribution of pervious materials and impervious barriers through field excavations within 1000 mm fig 1 above this depth both infiltration characteristics and runoff mechanisms may change infiltration characteristics of the three types of gis were measured during the rainy season july september at 24 locations of the xinyang sub district moret fernández et al 2021 fig 1b these experimental sites were chosen because they were typical artificial surfaces and located in areas influenced by human activities fig 1b observations of the infiltration rate were made using a double ring infiltrometer dj in12 w at three baseline sites for each of the infiltration based gis fig 1b with data being recorded at 10 min intervals observations of saturated hydraulic conductivity of the gis were recorded using a guelph permeameter eca tr09 as the infiltration process is difficult to observe during rainfall events data on saturated hydraulic conductivity at nine sites three groups for each gi and 12 sites four groups for each gi were used to calibrate and validate the simulation performance of the infiltration model respectively 2 3 modeling methods 2 3 1 layered infiltration model the hydrus 1d v 4 04 model was used in this study to simulate water flow in variably saturated porous media on the layered gis during a rain event šimůnek et al 2016 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 the hydrus 1d model is considered an effective tool for solving the richards equation in one dimensional finite element models li et al 2020 this model can be coupled with others for rainfall runoff simulation of the gis with multiple layers baek et al 2020 it is a powerful and wide ranging model for urban catchments because of the detailed description of the pervious layers and the accurate reflection of physical processes infiltration simulations in a vertical direction and the overland flow from the gis were conducted using hydrus 1d šimůnek and nimmo 2005 in this study the single porosity model van genuchten mualem with an air entry value of 2 cm was used to represent flow in the porous media rassam et al 2018 since this study mainly analyzed the hydrological effects of vertical spatial structure at the facility scale it is assumed that rainfall and infiltration processes are not affected by horizontal flow exchange li et al 2018 winston et al 2016 found lateral flow to be the dominant pathway providing volume reduction in three bioretention cells constructed in low permeability soils the unsaturated water flow was then described using the one dimensional richards equation 1 θ t z k h z 1 s where θ is the volumetric moisture content l3l 3 h is the water pressure head l s is the sink term l3l 3t 1 and k is the unsaturated hydrologic conductivity lt 1 described by the function 2 k h z k s z k r h z where kr is the relative hydraulic conductivity and ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 2 3 2 initial and boundary conditions the van genuchten mualem model can flexibly handle different flow boundaries and conceptualize homogeneous and heterogeneous soil structures li et al 2020 the number of materials representing the three types of gis pp vs and rg was divided into 3 4 and 5 layers respectively table 1 the water hysteresis and root water uptake were neglected the effects of layer thickness and the depths of impervious barriers on infiltration and runoff during a rain event were studied an atmospheric boundary for upper boundary conditions with surface layers was applied at the gis and the seepage face was set as the lower boundary condition the pressure heads were considered the initial condition and were set to linearly increase with depth a seepage face boundary acts as a zero pressure head boundary when the bottom boundary node is saturated and as a no flux boundary when it is unsaturated brunetti et al 2016 the pervious layers were assumed to be homogeneous and potential evapotranspiration was excluded because the input condition was a rain event lasting less than 12 h the observation point was set at the top of the flow domain z 0 2 3 3 model calibration and validation the observed and simulated value of the infiltration rate and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the gis were used for performance analysis and model calibration validation five parameters of soil hydraulic properties residual water content for θr saturated water content for θs hydraulic shape parameter for α hydraulic parameter for n and saturated hydraulic conductivity for ks were considered in each layer which were used as calibration parameters therefore the model was calibrated using infiltration process data for the three gis from the baseline sites the initial values for each vertical layer of these five parameters were calculated using the neural network prediction pedotransfer tool rassam et al 2018 this was built into the model within the known texture and bulk density ranges jian et al 2021 the observed ks data of the gis from the nine experimental sites fig 1b were used for calibrating the model by adjusting the ks values in each vertical layer based on observations from experimental sites and previous studies for local gi in xiamen cheviron and coquet 2009 mei et al 2020 the corresponding values for the soil hydraulic parameters were calibrated table 3 validation of the model was performed using the observed ks data from 12 experimental sites fig 1b the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse eq 3 nash and sutcliffe 1970 and determination coefficient r 2 eq 4 are common indicators of model performance for evaluating the goodness of fit between simulated and observed values and were used for the infiltration model evaluation as follows 3 nse 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 4 r 2 i 1 n s i s o i o i 1 n s i s 2 i 1 n o i o 2 2 where si is the simulated value at the ith time step oi is the observed value at the ith time step s is the mean value of the simulated data and o is the mean value of the observed data if nse 0 5 and r 2 0 5 the simulated data can be deemed acceptable the closer the nse and r 2 values are to 1 the better the performance of the model in this study if the nse and r 2 values were greater than 0 6 and 0 8 respectively the simulation performance was considered good 2 3 4 simulation scenarios several key factors such as infrastructure type vertical layer distribution material thickness and impervious barrier position were studied based on the model characteristics the ranges of these factors were determined following the field observation fig 1b and the requirements specified in the sponge city construction technical guide low impact development rainwater system construction trial mohurd 2014 in this study in situ digging and observation results showed that the most common layered structures and thicknesses of the three gis were selected as baseline scenarios table 1 the baseline scenarios were used to compare gis without an impervious barrier the effects of the gis on stormwater infiltration and overland flow are mediated by microtopographic reestablishment within 1000 mm bruland and richardson 2005 and local groundwater levels 500 5500 mm a total depth profile of 1000 mm was used as the vertical description range for the analysis of the infiltration characteristics the observed physical properties of the vertical layers and the position of waterproof infrastructure for the three gis were input into hydrus 1d to simulate the infiltration process the materials and thickness of the layers obtained from the field sites where typical gis are located were used in the baseline simulations the ranges of variation in layer thicknesses measured from the experimental sites were used in the designed scenarios table 1 the burial depth of the impervious barrier was 700 mm below the surface according to facilities design manuals xmcb 2016 and field surveys fig a1 we used a change step of 10 mm for the gi layers up to a thickness of 200 mm and a change step of 50 mm for those over 200 mm thick the thickness of the last layer is dynamically fluctuated with the thickness of the other layers to ensure that the total depth of each gi remains 1000 mm the impacts of impervious barriers at different burial depths on infiltration characteristics were evaluated by comparing the resulting mir and ci to that of baseline simulations while infiltration based gis are typically designed to meet a 5 10 year return period storms fu et al 2020 gong et al 2021 here we use a 20 year storm to capture the extreme events that can occur in southeastern coastal parts of china xmcb 2016 the data from the design rain event with duration of 720 min and total rainfall depth of 240 3 mm were input and compiled from the xiamen meteorological station and the rainfall intensity formula liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b mohurd 2016 5 q 1123 95 1 0 759 lg p t 6 3 0 582 t 6 3 0 582 where q is the rainfall intensity l s hm2 t is the design duration of the rainfall min and p is the return period year for the scope of application 180 min t 1440 min 3 results 3 1 infiltration model evaluation historical observation datasets during rainfall events at the site scale are very limited measuring the variation in infiltration rates during rain events is difficult because of inadequate station densities therefore the hydraulic parameters of layered heterogeneous soils were calibrated and validated against the available data from the field infiltration experiments we observed and acquired the variation in infiltration rates for the three gis with a constant pressure head of 10 cm which infiltrated a total of 94 2 278 3 mm the variations in the observed and simulated infiltration at the three gis are shown in fig 2 the model calibration for the infiltration rate based on field infiltration experiments resulted in nse and r 2 values of 0 74 to 0 94 and 0 87 to 0 94 respectively to improve the calibration results another round of calibration based on the observed ks was performed and the key parameters were determined for each vertical layer where the nse and r 2 values of ks were greater than 0 6 and 0 8 respectively these results indicate that the layered infiltration model is suitable for estimating infiltration potential in this study table 2 shows the nse and r 2 of ks in the calibration and verification period the verified values of the key parameters for the layered infiltration model with heterogeneous soils are shown in table 3 3 2 infiltration characteristics under different layer thicknesses 3 2 1 permeable pavement the maximum infiltration rate mir and cumulative infiltration ci of pp during the designed rain event duration of 720 min and return period of 20 years were simulated at different layer thicknesses fig 3 the results of the 72 scenarios comprised three types of permeable bricks 60 mm 70 mm and 80 mm each of which contained six crushed stones and four permeable concretes while we simulated changed to depth of each of the five layers of pp table 1 the results were primarily sensitive to depth changes across three of these layers thus we show results across these three layers only fig 3 shows that as the permeable brick thickness increased the mir and ci of the pp also increased owing to the higher porosity of the crushed stones than that of other pervious materials more space can be provided to promote the infiltration flux for this layer regarding the variations in the mir fig 3a and ci fig 3b for the 24 scenarios thicker crushed stones or permeable concrete yielded greater mir and ci values for the pp the mir and ci simulated for 80 mm permeable brick 150 mm crushed stone and 180 mm permeable concrete were 1 3 and 1 1 times higher than for 60 mm permeable brick 100 mm crushed stone and 150 mm permeable concrete respectively 3 2 2 vegetative swale for vertical layers of crushed stone and planting soil with 66 thickness scenarios variation in the mir and ci of the vs showed similar patterns to those of the pp fig 4 while we simulated changed to depth of each of the four layers of vs table 1 the results were primarily sensitive to depth changes across two of these layers thus we show results across these two layers only compared with the results from the pp the variable ranges of infiltration characteristics were different due to their positive relationship with the thickness of the crushed stone and the planting soil the highest infiltration characteristics found from the 200 mm crushed stone and the 450 mm planting soil were 45 8 mm h for the mir and 205 24 mm for ci respectively fig 4 this is compared to the lowest simulation with mir and ci values of 24 37 mm h and 166 02 mm a difference of 1 9 and 1 2 times respectively 3 2 3 rain garden the general trends in the variation of the mir and ci for rg were similar to those for pp and vs with 66 thickness scenarios fig 5 while we simulated changed to depth of each of the three layers of rg table 1 the results were primarily sensitive to depth changes across two of these layers the thickness of the artificial fill was positively correlated with the infiltration characteristics but increases in planting soil thickness led to a decline in the mir and ci these results are due to the assessment range being limited to 1000 mm and the remaining crushed stone layer having a negative relationship with planting soil and artificial fill therefore the infiltration characteristics were still positively correlated with the thickness of the crushed stone the rg layer thickness had little effect on the resulting range of mir and ci 3 3 impact of depth to impervious layer 3 3 1 variation in maximum infiltration rate a comparison between the simulations with and without the impervious barriers of the three gis showed no noticeable differences in the mir at 700 mm burial depths fig 6 results show little effect on the mir for the gis when the burial depth of the impervious barrier was over 700 1000 mm fig 6 a shows that the extent of the depth to the impervious layer that affected the mir for ppb vsb and rgb where b indicates the presence of a barrier was between 700 mm and 800 mm for the δmir of the three gis without an impervious barrier in fig 6 b the reduction in the mir was 10 mm h various depths to the impervious layer had the most pronounced impact on rgb with a mean reduction of 1 24 mm the linear fitting curves between δmir and depths to the impervious layer 700 800 mm for ppb vsb and rgb were plotted in fig 6 c in this study functional relationships were used to calculate and analyze the variation in the mir of the gis alongside other scenarios 3 3 2 variation in cumulative infiltration the effects of depths to the impervious layer on infiltration characteristics are usually ignored in the design and implementation of stormwater control systems phillips et al 2019 the variation in ci with different depths to the impervious layer 700 1000 mm were simulated and analyzed in fig 7 a the minimum ci of ppb vsb and rgb found from the 700 mm depth to the impervious layer simulations were 73 9 mm 85 3 mm and 95 3 mm respectively these results demonstrate that the ci of the gis increased with depth to the impervious layer fig 7 b shows the reduction effects of impervious barriers on cis compared with the typical gis the mean ci simulated with various scenarios of depths to the impervious layer decreased by 42 5 73 7 mm for ppb 17 4 23 3 mm for vsb and 35 5 73 1 mm for rgb therefore the presence of an impervious barrier had the most significant impact on the variation in ci in ppb and pp systems while the vsb and vs systems had the least pronounced response the three curves in fig 7 c represent the functional relationships between the burial depth and reduction in ci these results express the impact of depth to the impervious layer on the infiltration characteristics of the gis which can provide a basis for subsequent infiltration potential assessments 3 4 infiltration potential assessment fig 8 depicts the infiltration characteristics of pp vs rg ppb vsb and rgb with all possible scenarios the mir and ci of the six gis ranged from 23 6 to 46 6 mm h and 72 4 to 206 1 mm respectively based on statistical results 27 9 of the infiltration based gis with mir greater than 37 8 mm h and ci greater than 135 7 mm for the gis without an impervious barrier less than 3 of the pp 37 9 of the vs and all rg exceeded the mean level of actual infiltration rate and volume however with the influence of an impervious barrier the proportion of ppb vsb and rgb with high infiltration potential decreased by 2 5 0 7 and 53 3 respectively 3 5 overland flow response to infiltration potential to investigate the hydrologic runoff mechanisms of infiltration based gis with different mir and ci the infiltration process and overland flow of eight gis during a rain event were calculated using hydrus 1d overland flow refers to surface flow of the gis in this study using the design rain event approach described in 2 3 4 the required time variable input data are rainfall intensity total rainfall depth and hyetograph a time step of 60 sec is used for the hyetograph input and runoff outcome overland flow can be calculated subsequently as the difference between the rainfall intensity and infiltration rate both instantaneous infiltration rate cumulative infiltration and overland flow are stored as output and displayed in fig 9 table a5 in the supplementary information shows the infiltration potential facility type and vertical profile information of the eight gis fig 9 shows the maximum infiltration rate mir cumulative infiltration ci overland flow and cumulative overland flow depth for the eight gis with different mir and ci since the rainfall intensity was less than the mir in the initial 300 min fig 9a no runoff appeared on the surface for all the gis fig 9c then as the rainfall intensity increased and the infiltration rate decreased the overland flow also increased as shown in fig 9 most of the overland flow appeared during the 300 420 min period even though the time of flow generation is consistent with the decaying order of the infiltration rate fig 9 b and d show the cumulative depth of infiltration and runoff respectively furthermore comparing the cumulative infiltration and overland flow process of the typical gis can establish the relationship between infiltration potential and runoff mechanisms fig 9 in particular offers illustrative evidence of both hortonian and non hortonian overland flow for gi no 1 gi no 2 gi no 5 and gi no 6 facilities with lower ci the infiltration depth did not change when the overland flow appeared therefore the rainfall runoff was generated principally by the saturation excess mechanism non hortonian overland flow in contrast the other facilities gi no 3 gi no 4 gi no 7 and gi no 8 with higher ci the rainfall runoff was driven by the infiltration excess mechanism hortonian overland flow the results of overland flow suggest that the gis gi no 1 gi no 4 with higher mir outperform those with lower infiltration potential in peak flow reduction under the same rainfall conditions fig 9c however it is observed that cumulative overland flow results from gis with lower ci are generally higher than those from gi no 3 gi no 4 gi no 7 and gi no 8 facilities fig 9d 4 discussion assessing the infiltration potential of gi is key for urban hydrological modeling and stormwater management ebrahimian et al 2021 van der meij et al 2018 wang et al 2020 as it aids in identifying potential impacts of infiltration processes on stormwater controls and in understanding the mechanisms of rainfall runoff responses in urban hydrology in this study changes in layer thickness showed different trends in response to infiltration characteristics for the three typical gis this can be explained by considering the effects of vertical distribution and artificial construction on physical properties it is likely that the range of variation in the mir and ci with layer thicknesses during the designed rain event could be 20 mm h and 39 mm respectively indicating that the infiltration potential of the vs is dependent on the thickness of the planting soil and crushed stone fig 4 similarly the infiltration potential of pp increased as expected with the thickness of the permeable brick permeable concrete and crushed stone across the 72 scenarios fig 3 there was no noticeable change in the mir or ci for the rg during 66 scenarios due to the high actual flux and infiltration capacity fig 5 these results indicate that a linear relationship exists between infiltration potential and layer thickness and that the enhanced infiltration effect could be demonstrated and detected hellies et al 2018 kidmose et al 2015 therefore the interaction between layer thickness and infiltration potential based on the layered infiltration model is important and an artificial design on vertical layers may improve the overall standard of the gis for stormwater control a study by fidal and kjeldsen 2020 has confirmed that the infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration directly affects rainfall runoff processes regarding the impervious barriers at 1000 mm below the surface the ci changed dynamically with depth to the impervious layer and was dependent on the water storage conditions of the gis fig 7 in addition to the mir that was more stable at various depths fig 6 an impervious layer or roof may limit the maximum infiltration capacity by blocking the flow path in vertical space as reported for the variation of infiltration characteristics for the three typical gis with different depths of impervious barriers therefore shallow underground facilities with a waterproof construction will result in losses in stormwater storage capacity which can make the gis ineffective as opposed to making the losses in stormwater storage capacity ineffective thus the vertical layers with and without impervious barriers should be considered key in the simulation of urban hydrological processes chen et al 2021 an important challenge in urban hydrology is quantifying the effect of artificial infrastructure on infiltration processes sage et al 2020 all possible scenarios for the gi types presented here were simulated with hydrus 1d and statistically evaluated for the infiltration potential of the gis according to the practice types layer thicknesses and depths to the impervious layer the effectiveness of the gis has improvement for reducing runoff and mitigating flooding fig 8 based on this study impervious barrier effects could be considered as solutions for infrastructure optimization through the adequate investigation of ppb and vsb linear relationships relating to changes in the mir and ci with depth to impervious barriers were identified and have potential utility in allowing assessments of infiltration performance of infiltration based gi 5 conclusions the perviousness of underlying urban surfaces is highly heterogeneous and these surfaces have complex artificial infrastructures changes in urban environments are related to the vertical spatial distribution of permeable layered materials and impermeable facilities in this study we quantified the impacts of the types and thickness of pp vs and rg on simulated infiltration characteristics within a depth of 1000 mm below the urban surface we compared simulations with and without impervious barriers and identified the linear relationships of the mir and ci with depth finally the infiltration potential of the gis was configured and evaluated in the study site based on the calculated predictions for all possible scenarios the results show that the infiltration characteristics of the gis are highly sensitive to the vertical structures of both the layer thicknesses and depths to the impervious layer moreover less than 30 of the gis with infiltration potential exceeded the average level of mir and ci and more than 70 of the gis could change their own overland flow mechanism by optimizing the vertical structure considering our results it is suggested to incorporate the heterogeneous layered properties of the gis and detailed perviousness assessments into urban hydrological simulations at the catchment scale the influence of vegetation cover root systems and water content on infiltration characteristics should be further studied furthermore changing the thickness of the vertical layers and the layout of gray green infrastructure can mitigate urban flooding more effectively such modifications could improve our understanding of rainfall runoff mechanisms in urban areas and help to better manage flooding risks credit authorship contribution statement xiaoran fu conceptualization methodology software validation investigation

2223,in the past decades most tibetan lakes experienced large scale rises in response to current global warming conflicting with the limited amplitudes and gradual fluctuation in shoreline based lake levels that occurred over the holocene the discrepancy is a critical issue in understanding the regional response to global climate in this study we reconstructed the holocene lake level variations based on high resolution luminescence ages of thirty seven samples from fourteen shorelines of nam co in interior tibet the findings of this work concluded that nam co witnessed millennial large scale lake level fluctuations with periodical outflows during 11 9 8 3 ka and a broad decrease thereafter seven highstand events with ages of ca 11 9 11 0 8 3 6 7 5 1 4 2 3 4 2 4 and 1 1 ka were identified consistent with the north atlantic warmer intervals indicating a quick response to global climatic events in particular the dramatic lake level decline during the transition from the medieval warm period to little ice age demonstrated its potential rapid and sensitive response to millennial climatic changes our high resolution osl dates enabled detection of millennial scale highstand events based on comparison with other global and regional paleoclimatic records we suggested that holocene highstands were mainly attributed to the strengthened monsoonal precipitation and increased glacier meltwater that amplifies lake level fluctuations of glacier fed lakes and that paleoclimate and paleo lake level reconstruction by core proxies during lake overflow stages could be problematic

monsoonal precipitation is widely considered as the dominant factor for the lake level rise on the tp hudson and quade 2013 hudson et al 2015 for some glacier fed lakes such as selin co the holocene lake level change can only be explained by monsoonal precipitation and glacier meltwater hou et al 2021 schütt et al 2008 suggested that glacier meltwater provided by the last glacial maximum lgm glaciers from nyainqentanglha mountains explain 50 of the post glaciation lake volume growth based on the semi quantitative estimation of lake water balance modern observations also reveal that the

methods 3 1 materials lake shorelines can clearly be identified as partial rings around nam co fig 1c and 1d directly demonstrating past lake level changes e g lehmkuhl et al 2002 schütt et al 2008 the abandoned outlet on the northwestern nam co and related spillway fig 1b indicate that nam co had overflowed to the ring co and finally to the selin co zhou et al 2020 both the highest paleoshorelines and the overflow point are located at an elevation of 4753 m asl i e 23 m above modern lake level amll a total of thirty seven osl samples were collected from twenty three sections representing fourteen shorelines with altitudes ranging from 4753 to 4731 m asl i e 23 1 m amll on the eastern and northwestern coast of nam co fig s1 and s2 sampling locations from shorelines were selected to ensure that the age of sediments represents the timing of shoreline formation based on their geomorphological and stratigraphical characteristics detailed sample information including the location elevation depth below current ground surface and lithology are summarized in text s1 and table s1 in supplementary materials 3 2 osl dating osl sample preparation was conducted under dim red light in the laboratory and followed the routine procedure see text s2 in supplementary materials osl measurements were carried out on an automated risø tl osl da 20 reader equipped with a 90sr 90y beta source with a dose rate of 0 117 gy s blue leds 470 20 nm were used as the stimulating light source for quartz and infrared leds 875 80 nm were utilized for feldspar contamination tests osl signals were detected through a 7 5 mm hoya u 340 filter quartz coarse grains between 90 and 180 μm osl dating with a modified single aliquot regenerative sar protocol table s2 was employed for the equivalent dose de determination an et al 2020 murray and wintle 2000 before using the sar protocol for quartz osl dating the preheat plateau test was conducted on two samples nmc7 a and nmc15 a to determine the best preheat temperature each preheat temperature varied from 200 c to 300 c within the interval of 20 c increments and the cut heat temperature was 40 c lower than the preheat temperature four aliquots were measured for each temperature point in the dose recovery test aliquots were bleached with 100 s blue light before being irradiated a laboratory dose 2 7 gy for nmc7 a and 12 0 gy for nmc15 a and the sar protocol was then applied to recover this known dose the environmental dose rate means the supply rate of ionizing radiation to the grains over the burial period the concentrations of radioactive elements 232th 238u and 40k were determined using neutron activation analysis naa marked with n in table 1 and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms for the u and th determination and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes for the k determination marked with i in table 1 the concentration of radioactive elements was calculated into the dose rate according to aitken 1998 the cosmic ray dose rate was estimated for each sample as a function of the density of cover deposits depth altitude and geomagnetic latitude prescott and hutton 1994 the measured moisture value in the laboratory can be utilized as a reference to the average long term water content of each sample an error of 5 was applied to contain any likely variations over their buried time subsequently we assumed a water content of 5 5 based on the measured values for all the sand and gravel shoreline samples and aeolian deposits formed afterwards water content values for clay sediments e g nmc7 a should be higher and have been estimated up to 15 5 dose rate and age calculator was used to calculate the dose rates and osl ages durcan et al 2015 detailed results have been presented in table 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluation of the osl chronology 4 1 1 luminescence characteristics fig 2 a and 2b demonstrate that the de plateau for both samples nmc7 a and nmc15 a falls into 220 280 c the preheat and cut heat temperatures in this study were set as 260 c and 220 c respectively table s2 the resultant ratios of measured to given dose are in the range of 1 0 0 1 fig 2c and 2d confirming the reliability of sar protocol for the measured samples fig 2e and 2f show the decay and growth curves of a representative sample 17 nmc1 d the osl signals are sufficiently bright with a high signal to noise ratio and rapidly decreased to a level of indistinguishable from the background within the first second fig 2e suggesting the dominance of the fast component which has been considered as the reliable signal for osl dating osl signals of the first 0 64 s stimulation were integrated for growth curve construction after background subtraction of the last 8 s signals the aliquots passing the criterion where the ratio of irsl to the osl signals is less than 5 and the recuperation is less than 5 are used in de calculation 4 1 2 the reliability of shoreline osl ages quartz osl dating has been successfully applied on numerous lake shorelines on the tp e g qinghai lake see the review by huang et al 2021 zhari namco chen et al 2013 jonell et al 2020 tangra yumco ahlborn et al 2015 taro co alivernini et al 2018 and selin co luo et al 2021 shi et al 2017 two potential limitations should be investigated when using osl dating on tibetan lake shorelines which are incomplete bleaching prior to deposition and dim quartz osl signals although mineral grains are transported washed and sorted prior to shoreline formation both partial e g shi et al 2017 and sufficient bleaching e g jonell et al 2020 luo et al 2021 conditions for quartz osl signals have been reported de distributions were investigated to assure whether our samples were bleached sufficiently prior to deposition the overdispersion od value was applied for describing de distributions which is the basic standard deviation for measuring uncertainties and choosing the age model the od of de values of the majority samples 27 out of 37 are less than 20 or even below 5 fig 2g s3 and s4 indicating that de values for all these samples are centered on the average value galbraith and roberts 2012 it also indicates that quartz osl signals in most samples are well bleached in this regard the final de can be calculated using the central age model cam however other samples 10 out of 37 with their od larger than 20 fig 2h and s5 suggest that quartz osl signals may be partially bleaching the minimum age model mam was then applied arnold and roberts 2009 galbraith and roberts 2012 for those potentially incomplete bleaching samples their de values are less than 3 5 gy using the mam method except for 17nmc14 a with the de value of 4 8 0 7 gy when using the cam method their de values are higher but still less than 4 8 gy and only the de of 17nmc14 a is up to 10 2 1 2 gy therefore age disparities obtained by the cam and mam would only have an influence on lake level changes since 2 0 ka fig 3 a with little effect on other earlier highstands h2 h7 in fig 3a the osl dating reliability can also be verified by comparing quartz osl ages of parallel samples from the same sedimentary layer for example the age of 17nmc13 a 2 4 0 2 ka agrees with that of 17nmc13 b 2 3 0 1 ka from the same layer additionally osl ages from different sites but with the same elevation i e from the same shoreline constrained in the same age group showing robust osl results e g 17nmc12 a 11 0 0 5 ka 17nmc17 a 11 1 0 5 ka and 17nmc19 a 11 9 0 5 ka osl ages from all sections are in chronostratigraphic order within uncertainties in the present study another potential problem is that the quartz osl signal is too dim to measure the de value e g samples from selin co hou et al 2021 previous studies indicated that quartz osl signals from many tibetan lakes were bright with the signal to noise ratio of at least greater than 3 chen et al 2013 luo et al 2021 shi et al 2015 fig 2e suggests that quartz osl signals are strongly distinguishable from the background indicating the suitability of quartz osl signals in dating shoreline samples from nam co all of the samples in this study have the signal to noise ratios higher than 3 4 2 holocene lake level changes a systematic holocene lake level history of nam co was reconstructed fig 3a based on 37 high resolution shoreline osl ages ranging from 11 9 0 5 to 0 51 0 06 ka table 1 our findings revealed that the lake experienced two main stages during the holocene firstly the periodically open lake stage from 11 9 0 5 to 8 3 0 4 ka during which the lake filled sufficiently to overflow to selin co via the northwestern outlet fig 1b in highstand intervals between 11 9 11 0 and 8 3 ka the paleo shorelines at the same outlet elevation are the most apparent continuous and developed suggesting that lake levels have reached or kept at this elevation for a relatively long time secondly the closed lake stage in the middle and late holocene post 8 3 ka during which lake levels fluctuated intermittently but there was no evidence of overflow and on the contrary lake levels dropped periodically by at least 35 m in total two short highstands were identified at 6 7 and 5 1 ka during the middle holocene the three events of lake level fluctuations during the late holocene are intensively reconstructed especially the last lake recession from 1 1 to 0 51 ka possibly corresponding to the transition from the medieval warm period mwp from ce 1400 to 800 to little ice age lia from ce 1850 to 1400 ge et al 2013 yang et al 2002 the shorelines below 4730 m asl were recently submerged by the re rising modern lake level thus we speculate that the lake was at a significantly lower level during the whole lia period and possibly even lower than 4718 m asl as in ce 1970s guan et al 1984 numerous investigations on core sediments and lake shorelines have been carried out to reconstruct holocene hydrological variations in nam co e g chen et al 2017 daut et al 2010 kasper et al 2013 lehmkuhl et al 2002 mügler et al 2010 schütt et al 2008 zhu et al 2015 recently kasper et al 2021 re evaluated the holocene lake level change of nam co fig 3b derived from the multi proxy records i e geochemical sedimentological and micropaleontological data combined partly with numerical elevation data from previous studies they suggested that nam co lake levels increased rapidly at the beginning of the early holocene reached the highest lake level at ca 9 4 ka bp and remained at the stable high lake level until ca 8 0 ka bp thereafter the lake level gradually but steadily decreased throughout the middle to late holocene fig 3b however the significant uncertainty and rough reconstruction shallow blue shading in fig 3b existed for the lake level curve reported by kasper et al 2021 because the lake sediment records could not directly indicate lake level fluctuations and lake shoreline dating results were in low resolution chen et al 2017 lehmkuhl et al 2002 schütt et al 2008 in comparison to previous studies this study established a detailed holocene lake level history of nam co on multi centennial and millennial timescales based on the high resolution osl dating on lake shorelines during which lake levels increased until nam co periodically overflowed from 11 9 to 8 3 ka and broadly decreased thereafter and seven highstand stages were identified and dated to ca 11 9 11 0 8 3 6 7 5 1 4 2 3 4 2 4 and 1 1 ka 4 3 rapid lake level changes in response to global climate change seven holocene highstands of nam co possibly correspond to millennial scale warmer intervals in the north atlantic na ocean fig 3c bond et al 2001 well reconstructed lake level changes of ngangla ring tso on the southwestern tp also indicated that millennial scale changes in lake levels were correlated to holocene ice rafted debris ird events in the na ocean hudson et al 2015 the signals in the na regions might have affected the lake level change on the tp through atmospheric teleconnection and the north southward migration of mid latitude westerlies bond et al 2001 cai et al 2012 cheng et al 2016 huang et al 2022 porter and an 1995 wang et al 2005 zhu et al 2015 a dramatic drop of more than 14 m occurred from 1 1 to 0 51 ka i e the mwp lia transition fig 3a which is one of the most recent worldwide climatic transitions characterized by a dramatic decrease in precipitation and temperature as identified by multiple archives across the tp and its adjacent areas e g stalagmites cai et al 2012 wang et al 2005 peat bog records hong et al 2003 marine sediments bond et al 2001 gupta et al 2003 lake sediments bird et al 2014 lan et al 2020 liu et al 2014 and glacier activities liu et al 2014 peng et al 2020 for example the temperature in the lia was about 0 5 0 6 c lower than that in the mwp in china ge et al 2013 another two lake level drop events of nam co at 2 2 1 7 and 3 0 2 6 ka also congruent with the regional glacier advances liu et al 2014 peng et al 2020 and na cold events e g bond 2 and 3 events fig 3c respectively bond et al 2001 the modern rising amplitude of nam co with ca 12 m in the past 40 years guan et al 1984 wang et al 2020 is comparable with the declining amplitude of lake levels in the mwp lia transition 14 m and about one third of that during the whole holocene 35 m the abrupt large scale lake level fluctuations in both modern time and geological history could be a typical pattern for the evolution of tibetan lakes e g nam co and selin co corresponding to frequent paleoclimatic changes on millennial or even centennial timescales this challenges the previous understanding that mega lakes are relatively stable during long term climatic fluctuations and suggests that the reconstructed relatively stable holocene lake level fluctuations history might require re investigation e g ahlborn et al 2015 kasper et al 2021 4 4 geomorphologic and climatic indicators of lake shorelines as we discussed in section 4 3 tibetan lakes experienced a series of millennial or multi centennial timescale changes in response to frequent holocene climate fluctuations a finding that lake shoreline reconstructions typically do not reveal for example most studies recognized that lake levels were relatively stable and high during the early to middle holocene and then declined in the late holocene chen et al 2013 shi et al 2017 kasper et al 2021 in our study such fluctuations were not found during the early to middle holocene fig 3a even though three rising declining cycles of the nam co were reported during the late holocene fig 3a which coincides with warm intervals low hematite between the cold ird events recorded in the na region fig 3c bond et al 2001 two main reasons are suggested for this discrepancy firstly when the lake experienced expansion contraction cycles shorelines formed s3 s5 in fig 4 a during the most recent decline could be well exposed on the surface while the lower shorelines s2 in fig 4a of the earlier cycles would be buried allowing only the higher ones exposed s1 in fig 4a therefore exposed surficial shorelines mainly include shorelines formed during the last recession e g mwp lia transition and the remaining unburied higher attitude shorelines of earlier fluctuation cycles fig 4b in this case the higher shorelines dated at ca 11 9 11 0 8 3 6 7 and 5 1 ka may suggest four cycles of fluctuations during the early to middle holocene rather than stable or slow changes in lake levels as previously reported e g kasper et al 2021 nam co should have experienced at least seven cycles of fluctuations with highstands at ca 11 9 11 0 8 3 6 7 5 1 4 2 3 4 2 4 and 1 1 ka and a dramatic decline at the wmp lia transition despite the fact that most of these sedimentary records were buried the comprehensive study of deep shoreline sections with recording the cycles of lake expansion contraction and high resolution sampling assisted in demonstrating the lake level evolution history as completely as possible some features of lake level fluctuations could not be fully demonstrated if only the surficial shorelines were sampled while only displaying a broadly lake declining trend fig 4b this could also explain why previous investigations in shoreline based lake levels have shown a relatively stable evolution trend 4 5 mechanisms of lake level fluctuations 4 5 1 monsoonal precipitation the increased monsoonal precipitation due to global warming has been considered as the dominant factor for the large scale expansion of many tibetan lakes in recent years biskop et al 2016 qiao and zhu 2019 sun et al 2018 sun et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 it also plays a vital role in different timescales of geological history bird et al 2014 chen et al 2013 hudson et al 2015 jonell et al 2020 liu et al 2021 shi et al 2017 zhu et al 2015 for instance the early holocene 11 2 8 6 ka highstands of ngangla ring tso were associated with the increased precipitation induced by an intensified ism while the lake level declines were correlated to the weak monsoonal precipitation hudson et al 2015 on suborbital timescales the broad highstands of nam co occurred in the early and middle holocene and have substantially decreased there are seven highstands at 11 9 11 0 8 3 6 7 5 1 4 2 3 4 2 4 and 1 1 ka on millennial timescales fig 5 a lake level variation pattern of nam co is broadly similar to those of the majority of tibetan lakes in the ism region e g selin co and ngangla ring tso within age uncertainties hou et al 2021 hudson et al 2015 luo et al 2021 shi et al 2017 the overall pattern coincides with the variation of the ism intensity fig 5b cai et al 2012 and moisture variations fig 5c chen et al 2019 on different timescales ism strengthened in the early and middle holocene and weakened thereafter as demonstrated by a combination of climatic proxies including stalagmites δ18o records from tianmen cave northwest of nam co fig 5b cai et al 2012 lacustrine sediments from southern and central parts of tp bird et al 2014 zhu et al 2015 peat δ13c records from eastern tp hong et al 2003 and marine sediment properties from the arabian sea gupta et al 2003 the intensified ism induced more monsoonal precipitation into the nam co catchment causing highstands during the early holocene and vice versa after the middle holocene recently the transient climate evolution of the last 21 ka trace 21 ka and kiel climate model kcm simulation results liu et al 2021 confirmed that lakes in the south central tp expanded to their highest levels during the early holocene when the solar induced ism was greatly intensified and that lake levels fell after the middle holocene when the ism weakened the most distinct pattern for the evolution of nam co is the periodical overflows during the early holocene and the closure during the middle and late holocene in this study three spilling events during the early holocene indicate a broad higher water level resulting from the increased precipitation associated with the intensified ism bird et al 2014 chen et al 2013 jonell et al 2020 liu et al 2021 shi et al 2017 zhu et al 2015 these spilling events hinder the use of lake levels in quantitatively reconstructing monsoonal precipitation as the response of lake level changes to climatic changes is nonlinear i e the lake level would remain at the elevation of the outlet even though the monsoonal precipitation keeps increasing consequently caution should be exercised when reconstructing the monsoonal precipitation changes based on lake level fluctuations of an exorheic lake 4 5 2 glacier meltwater apart from the monsoonal precipitation modern observation and simulation suggest that glacier meltwater has contributed significantly to the modern lake expansion in the past decades especially for the glacier fed lakes on the tp qiao and zhu 2019 sun et al 2018 sun et al 2020 zhu et al 2010 in the case of nam co more than 60 streams from the western nyainqentanglha mountains drain glacier meltwater directly into the lake although the area covered by glaciers in the nam co accounts for 2 of the catchment area biskop et al 2016 the contribution of meltwater to the total increased water storage accounted for more than 50 in recent years being equivalent to that of the precipitation qiao and zhu 2019 zhu et al 2010 2020 compared to the present day situation more extensive distributions of glaciers existed on the central tp during geological histories e g the lgm and early holocene dong et al 2018 schütt et al 2008 yan et al 2020 nyainqentanglha mountains glacier meltwater explained 50 of the post glaciation lake volume growth schütt et al 2008 during the warm periods e g the early holocene the rate of increase in water storage for most glacier fed lakes was much higher than that of non glacier fed lakes under the same climatic condition with a large amount of glacier meltwater flowing into the lakes on the contrary during the cold periods e g lia glacier fed lakes showed greater contraction than their non glacier fed lakes therefore glacier advance retreat enhances the amplitude of lake level variations during the holocene the extent of the glaciers on the southern and central tp was mainly above the present day level especially in the early and middle holocene yan et al 2020 the glacier activity directly responds to temperature changes on the central tp where glacier advance occurred at low temperatures and glacier retreat occurred at high temperatures chen et al 2020 liu et al 2014 ou et al 2014 consequently an early to middle holocene summer temperature maximum fig 5d chen et al 2020 induced by the strengthening of the suborbital scale solar irradiance berger and loutre 1991 may have quickly triggered the retreat of glaciers in the nam co catchment e g the nyainqentanglha mountains and generated more meltwater into nam co with the combination of both meltwater and greater monsoonal precipitation fig 5b and 5c nam co expanded until it periodically overflowed into ring co from 11 9 to 8 3 ka in the early holocene with two highstands at 6 7 and 5 1 ka in the middle holocene fig 3a during the late holocene the contribution of monsoonal precipitation decreased bird et al 2014 cai et al 2012 gupta et al 2003 zhu et al 2015 while nam co still had three highstands at ca 4 2 3 4 2 4 and 1 1 ka fig 3a corresponding to higher summer temperature intervals on the tp chen et al 2020 we propose that the increased meltwater was the main cause for these three highstands several studies have also proposed that glacier meltwater played a significant role in lake expansions and mega floods during the late holocene across the tp for example kalakuli lake a glacier fed lake on the pamir plateau westernmost tp experienced four highstands at 3 7 3 0 2 3 1 7 1 1 0 6 ka and the last 50 years fig 5e resulting from the increased meltwater as glaciers retreated liu et al 2014 large scale flood events of the keriya river in the northwestern margin of the tp occurred at 3 5 2 6 and 0 87 ka owing to increased glacier meltwater and or the outburst of glacier lakes an et al 2020 conversely during cold periods of the late holocene fig 5d large scale lake recessions occurred due to the decreased monsoonal precipitation and expanding glaciers during lia the climate conditions are regionally inconsistent atwood et al 2021 but numerous studies indicated that monsoonal precipitation reduced e g cai et al 2012 and glaciers advanced liu et al 2014 peng et al 2020 rowan 2017 on the tp during the transition from the warm and wet mwp to cold and dry lia therefore lake levels of nam co rapidly declined by at least 14 m at 1 1 0 51 ka fig 5a as a typical glacier fed lake nam co experienced frequent and abrupt lake level variations during the holocene on millennial timescales which were controlled by both monsoonal precipitation and glacier meltwater glacier retreat advance amplifies the relative magnitude of lake level fluctuations for glacier fed lakes when compared to non glacier fed lakes disrupting the direct relationship between lake level changes and monsoonal precipitation as a result caution should be taken when reconstructing the monsoonal precipitation using shoreline based lake level variations 5 conclusions based on thirty seven shoreline luminescence ages detailed holocene lake level variations of nam co were reconstructed nam co periodically overflowed during lake highstands during the early holocene 11 9 8 3 ka and then became closed thereafter seven highstands were identified at ca 11 9 11 0 8 3 6 7 5 1 4 2 3 4 2 4 and 1 1 ka which were concurrent with the na warmer intervals the dramatic lake level drop during the mwp lia transition indicates lake levels are sensitive to globally millennial scale climatic fluctuations the majority of earlier shorelines were buried by the later higher shoreline sediments therefore the complete lake level fluctuations would not be fully demonstrated if only the surficial shorelines were sampled the frequent and abrupt fluctuations of the glacier fed nam co could be explained by the combined repercussions of the monsoonal precipitation and glacier meltwater the glacier meltwater amplified the response of lake level fluctuations to climatic changes which makes the response nonlinear and more complicated consequently caution should be taken when reconstructing the holocene monsoonal precipitation

2223,in the past decades most tibetan lakes experienced large scale rises in response to current global warming conflicting with the limited amplitudes and gradual fluctuation in shoreline based lake levels that occurred over the holocene the discrepancy is a critical issue in understanding the regional response to global climate in this study we reconstructed the holocene lake level variations based on high resolution luminescence ages of thirty seven samples from fourteen shorelines of nam co in interior tibet the findings of this work concluded that nam co witnessed millennial large scale lake level fluctuations with periodical outflows during 11 9 8 3 ka and a broad decrease thereafter seven highstand events with ages of ca 11 9 11 0 8 3 6 7 5 1 4 2 3 4 2 4 and 1 1 ka were identified consistent with the north atlantic warmer intervals indicating a quick response to global climatic events in particular the dramatic lake level decline during the transition from the medieval warm period to little ice age demonstrated its potential rapid and sensitive response to millennial climatic changes our high resolution osl dates enabled detection of millennial scale highstand events based on comparison with other global and regional paleoclimatic records we suggested that holocene highstands were mainly attributed to the strengthened monsoonal precipitation and increased glacier meltwater that amplifies lake level fluctuations of glacier fed lakes and that paleoclimate and paleo lake level reconstruction by core proxies during lake overflow stages could be problematic

monsoonal precipitation is widely considered as the dominant factor for the lake level rise on the tp hudson and quade 2013 hudson et al 2015 for some glacier fed lakes such as selin co the holocene lake level change can only be explained by monsoonal precipitation and glacier meltwater hou et al 2021 schütt et al 2008 suggested that glacier meltwater provided by the last glacial maximum lgm glaciers from nyainqentanglha mountains explain 50 of the post glaciation lake volume growth based on the semi quantitative estimation of lake water balance modern observations also reveal that the

55 n 90 16 91 03 e is located in the central tp fig 1 a with an area of 2020 km2 and the maximum depth of 99 m in ce 2019 wang et al 2020 its lake levels increased from 4718 to 4730 m above sea level asl during ce 1978 2019 hence the lake was the largest lake on the tp in terms of area and water volume before being exceeded by selin co in ce 2014 wang et al 2020 both indian summer monsoon ism dominating from may to september and the westerlies in winter have an impact on regional climate the mean annual air temperature is around 0 c and the mean annual precipitation is 450 mm guan et al 1984 ma et al 2012 the mean annual evaporation from the lake surface is about 635 860 mm biskop et al 2016 lazhu et al 2016 ma et al 2016 southeastward of the nam co basin is the nyainqentanglha mountains fig 1b which peaks up to 7162 m asl and hosts over 100 glaciers more than 60 streams contribute glacier meltwater to nam co from the western mountain slope glacier meltwater contributed 8 6 to the total water supply during ce 1971 1991 11 5 during ce 1992 2004 zhu et al 2010 and 19 0 during ce 2001 2010 biskop et al 2016 however in recent years due to global warming the increased glacier meltwater has contributed to lake expansion equivalent to that of the precipitation and became one of the main reasons for the rapid lake expansion qiao and zhu 2019 zhu et al 2020 3 materials and methods 3 1 materials lake shorelines can clearly be identified as partial rings around nam co fig 1c and 1d directly demonstrating past lake level changes e g lehmkuhl et al 2002 schütt et al 2008 the abandoned outlet on the northwestern nam co and related spillway fig 1b indicate that nam co had overflowed to the ring co and finally to the selin co zhou et al 2020 both the highest paleoshorelines and the overflow point are located at an elevation of 4753 m asl i e 23 m above modern lake level amll a total of thirty seven osl samples were collected from twenty three sections representing fourteen shorelines with altitudes ranging from 4753 to 4731 m asl i e 23 1 m amll on the eastern and northwestern coast of nam co fig s1 and s2 sampling locations from shorelines were selected to ensure that the age of sediments represents the timing of shoreline formation based on their geomorphological and stratigraphical characteristics detailed sample information including the location elevation depth below current ground surface and lithology are summarized in text s1 and table s1 in supplementary materials 3 2 osl dating osl sample preparation was conducted under dim red light in the laboratory and followed the routine procedure see text s2 in supplementary materials osl measurements were carried out on an automated risø tl osl da 20 reader equipped with a 90sr 90y beta source with a dose rate of 0 117 gy s blue leds 470 20 nm were used as the stimulating light source for quartz and infrared leds 875 80 nm were utilized for feldspar contamination tests osl signals were detected through a 7 5 mm hoya u 340 filter quartz coarse grains between 90 and 180 μm osl dating with a modified single aliquot regenerative sar protocol table s2 was employed for the equivalent dose de determination an et al 2020 murray and wintle 2000 before using the sar protocol for quartz osl dating the preheat plateau test was conducted on two samples nmc7 a and nmc15 a to determine the best preheat temperature each preheat temperature varied from 200 c to 300 c within the interval of 20 c increments and the cut heat temperature was 40 c lower than the preheat temperature four aliquots were measured for each temperature point in the dose recovery test aliquots were bleached with 100 s blue light before being irradiated a laboratory dose 2 7 gy for nmc7 a and 12 0 gy for nmc15 a and the sar protocol was then applied to recover this known dose the environmental dose rate means the supply rate of ionizing radiation to the grains over the burial period the concentrations of radioactive elements 232th 238u and 40k were determined using neutron activation analysis naa marked with n in table 1 and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms for the u and th determination and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes for the k determination marked with i in table 1 the concentration of radioactive elements was calculated into the dose rate according to aitken 1998 the cosmic ray dose rate was estimated for each sample as a function of the density of cover deposits depth altitude and geomagnetic latitude prescott and hutton 1994 the measured moisture value in the laboratory can be utilized as a reference to the average long term water content of each sample an error of 5 was applied to contain any likely variations over their buried time subsequently we assumed a water content of 5 5 based on the measured values for all the sand and gravel shoreline samples and aeolian deposits formed afterwards water content values for clay sediments e g nmc7 a should be higher and have been estimated up to 15 5 dose rate and age calculator was used to calculate the dose rates and osl ages durcan et al 2015 detailed results have been presented in table 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluation of the osl chronology 4 1 1 luminescence characteristics fig 2 a and 2b demonstrate that the de plateau for both samples nmc7 a and nmc15 a falls into 220 280 c the preheat and cut heat temperatures in this study were set as 260 c and 220 c respectively table s2 the resultant ratios of measured to given dose are in the range of 1 0 0 1 fig 2c and 2d confirming the reliability of sar protocol for the measured samples fig 2e and 2f show the decay and growth curves of a representative sample 17 nmc1 d the osl signals are sufficiently bright with a high signal to noise ratio and rapidly decreased to a level of indistinguishable from the background within the first second fig 2e suggesting the dominance of the fast component which has been considered as the reliable signal for osl dating osl signals of the first 0 64 s stimulation were integrated for growth curve construction after background subtraction of the last 8 s signals the aliquots passing the criterion where the ratio of irsl to the osl signals is less than 5 and the recuperation is less than 5 are used in de calculation 4 1 2 the reliability of shoreline osl ages quartz osl dating has been successfully applied on numerous lake shorelines on the tp e g qinghai lake see the review by huang et al 2021 zhari namco chen et al 2013 jonell et al 2020 tangra yumco ahlborn et al 2015 taro co alivernini et al 2018 and selin co luo et al 2021 shi et al 2017 two potential limitations should be investigated when using osl dating on tibetan lake shorelines which are incomplete bleaching prior to deposition and dim quartz osl signals although mineral grains are transported washed and sorted prior to shoreline formation both partial e g shi et al 2017 and sufficient bleaching e g jonell et al 2020 luo et al 2021 conditions for quartz osl signals have been reported de distributions were investigated to assure whether our samples were bleached sufficiently prior to deposition the overdispersion od value was applied for describing de distributions which is the basic standard deviation for measuring uncertainties and choosing the age model the od of de values of the majority samples 27 out of 37 are less than 20 or even below 5 fig 2g s3 and s4 indicating that de values for all these samples are centered on the average value galbraith and roberts 2012 it also indicates that quartz osl signals in most samples are well bleached in this regard the final de can be calculated using the central age model cam however other samples 10 out of 37 with their od larger than 20 fig 2h and s5 suggest that quartz osl signals may be partially bleaching the minimum age model mam was then applied arnold and roberts 2009 galbraith and roberts 2012 for those potentially incomplete bleaching samples their de values are less than 3 5 gy using the mam method except for 17nmc14 a with the de value of 4 8 0 7 gy when using the cam method their de values are higher but still less than 4 8 gy and only the de of 17nmc14 a is up to 10 2 1 2 gy therefore age disparities obtained by the cam and mam would only have an influence on lake level changes since 2 0 ka fig 3 a with little effect on other earlier highstands h2 h7 in fig 3a the osl dating reliability can also be verified by comparing quartz osl ages of parallel samples from the same sedimentary layer for example the age of 17nmc13 a 2 4 0 2 ka agrees with that of 17nmc13 b 2 3 0 1 ka from the same layer additionally osl ages from different sites but with the same elevation i e from the same shoreline constrained in the same age group showing robust osl results e g 17nmc12 a 11 0 0 5 ka 17nmc17 a 11 1 0 5 ka and 17nmc19 a 11 9 0 5 ka osl ages from all sections are in chronostratigraphic order within uncertainties in the present study another potential problem is that the quartz osl signal is too dim to measure the de value e g samples from selin co hou et al 2021 previous studies indicated that quartz osl signals from many tibetan lakes were bright with the signal to noise ratio of at least greater than 3 chen et al 2013 luo et al 2021 shi et al 2015 fig 2e suggests that quartz osl signals are strongly distinguishable from the background indicating the suitability of quartz osl signals in dating shoreline samples from nam co all of the samples in this study have the signal to noise ratios higher than 3 4 2 holocene lake level changes a systematic holocene lake level history of nam co was reconstructed fig 3a based on 37 high resolution shoreline osl ages ranging from 11 9 0 5 to 0 51 0 06 ka table 1 our findings revealed that the lake experienced two main stages during the holocene firstly the periodically open lake stage from 11 9 0 5 to 8 3 0 4 ka during which the lake filled sufficiently to overflow to selin co via the northwestern outlet fig 1b in highstand intervals between 11 9 11 0 and 8 3 ka the paleo shorelines at the same outlet elevation are the most apparent continuous and developed suggesting that lake levels have reached or kept at this elevation for a relatively long time secondly the closed lake stage in the middle and late holocene post 8 3 ka during which lake levels fluctuated intermittently but there was no evidence of overflow and on the contrary lake levels dropped periodically by at least 35 m in total two short highstands were identified at 6 7 and 5 1 ka during the middle holocene the three events of lake level fluctuations during the late holocene are intensively reconstructed especially the last lake recession from 1 1 to 0 51 ka possibly corresponding to the transition from the medieval warm period mwp from ce 1400 to 800 to little ice age lia from ce 1850 to 1400 ge et al 2013 yang et al 2002 the shorelines below 4730 m asl were recently submerged by the re rising modern lake level thus we speculate that the lake was at a significantly lower level during the whole lia period and possibly even lower than 4718 m asl as in ce 1970s guan et al 1984 numerous investigations on core sediments and lake shorelines have been carried out to reconstruct holocene hydrological variations in nam co e g chen et al 2017 daut et al 2010 kasper et al 2013 lehmkuhl et al 2002 mügler et al 2010 schütt et al 2008 zhu et al 2015 recently kasper et al 2021 re evaluated the holocene lake level change of nam co fig 3b derived from the multi proxy records i e geochemical sedimentological and micropaleontological data combined partly with numerical elevation data from previous studies they suggested that nam co lake levels increased rapidly at the beginning of the early holocene reached the highest lake level at ca 9 4 ka bp and remained at the stable high lake level until ca 8 0 ka bp thereafter the lake level gradually but steadily decreased throughout the middle to late holocene fig 3b however the significant uncertainty and rough reconstruction shallow blue shading in fig 3b existed for the lake level curve reported by kasper et al 2021 because the lake sediment records could not directly indicate lake level fluctuations and lake shoreline dating results were in low resolution chen et al 2017 lehmkuhl et al 2002 schütt et al 2008 in comparison to previous studies this study established a detailed holocene lake level history of nam co on multi centennial and millennial timescales based on the high resolution osl dating on lake shorelines during which lake levels increased until nam co periodically overflowed from 11 9 to 8 3 ka and broadly decreased thereafter and seven highstand stages were identified and dated to ca 11 9 11 0 8 3 6 7 5 1 4 2 3 4 2 4 and 1 1 ka 4 3 rapid lake level changes in response to global climate change seven holocene highstands of nam co possibly correspond to millennial scale warmer intervals in the north atlantic na ocean fig 3c bond et al 2001 well reconstructed lake level changes of ngangla ring tso on the southwestern tp also indicated that millennial scale changes in lake levels were correlated to holocene ice rafted debris ird events in the na ocean hudson et al 2015 the signals in the na regions might have affected the lake level change on the tp through atmospheric teleconnection and the north southward migration of mid latitude westerlies bond et al 2001 cai et al 2012 cheng et al 2016 huang et al 2022 porter and an 1995 wang et al 2005 zhu et al 2015 a dramatic drop of more than 14 m occurred from 1 1 to 0 51 ka i e the mwp lia transition fig 3a which is one of the most recent worldwide climatic transitions characterized by a dramatic decrease in precipitation and temperature as identified by multiple archives across the tp and its adjacent areas e g stalagmites cai et al 2012 wang et al 2005 peat bog records hong et al 2003 marine sediments bond et al 2001 gupta et al 2003 lake sediments bird et al 2014 lan et al 2020 liu et al 2014 and glacier activities liu et al 2014 peng et al 2020 for example the temperature in the lia was about 0 5 0 6 c lower than that in the mwp in china ge et al 2013 another two lake level drop events of nam co at 2 2 1 7 and 3 0 2 6 ka also congruent with the regional glacier advances liu et al 2014 peng et al 2020 and na cold events e g bond 2 and 3 events fig 3c respectively bond et al 2001 the modern rising amplitude of nam co with ca 12 m in the past 40 years guan et al 1984 wang et al 2020 is comparable with the declining amplitude of lake levels in the mwp lia transition 14 m and about one third of that during the whole holocene 35 m the abrupt large scale lake level fluctuations in both modern time and geological history could be a typical pattern for the evolution of tibetan lakes e g nam co and selin co corresponding to frequent paleoclimatic changes on millennial or even centennial timescales this challenges the previous understanding that mega lakes are relatively stable during long term climatic fluctuations and suggests that the reconstructed relatively stable holocene lake level fluctuations history might require re investigation e g ahlborn et al 2015 kasper et al 2021 4 4 geomorphologic and climatic indicators of lake shorelines as we discussed in section 4 3 tibetan lakes experienced a series of millennial or multi centennial timescale changes in response to frequent holocene climate fluctuations a finding that lake shoreline reconstructions typically do not reveal for example most studies recognized that lake levels were relatively stable and high during the early to middle holocene and then declined in the late holocene chen et al 2013 shi et al 2017 kasper et al 2021 in our study such fluctuations were not found during the early to middle holocene fig 3a even though three rising declining cycles of the nam co were reported during the late holocene fig 3a which coincides with warm intervals low hematite between the cold ird events recorded in the na region fig 3c bond et al 2001 two main reasons are suggested for this discrepancy firstly when the lake experienced expansion contraction cycles shorelines formed s3 s5 in fig 4 a during the most recent decline could be well exposed on the surface while the lower shorelines s2 in fig 4a of the earlier cycles would be buried allowing only the higher ones exposed s1 in fig 4a therefore exposed surficial shorelines mainly include shorelines formed during the last recession e g mwp lia transition and the remaining unburied higher attitude shorelines of earlier fluctuation cycles fig 4b in this case the higher shorelines dated at ca 11 9 11 0 8 3 6 7 and 5 1 ka may suggest four cycles of fluctuations during the early to middle holocene rather than stable or slow changes in lake levels as previously reported e g kasper et al 2021 nam co should have experienced at least seven cycles of fluctuations with highstands at ca 11 9 11 0 8 3 6 7 5 1 4 2 3 4 2 4 and 1 1 ka and a dramatic decline at the wmp lia transition despite the fact that most of these sedimentary records were buried the comprehensive study of deep shoreline sections with recording the cycles of lake expansion contraction and high resolution sampling assisted in demonstrating the lake level evolution history as completely as possible some features of lake level fluctuations could not be fully demonstrated if only the surficial shorelines were sampled while only displaying a broadly lake declining trend fig 4b this could also explain why previous investigations in shoreline based lake levels have shown a relatively stable evolution trend 4 5 mechanisms of lake level fluctuations 4 5 1 monsoonal precipitation the increased monsoonal precipitation due to global warming has been considered as the dominant factor for the large scale expansion of many tibetan lakes in recent years biskop et al 2016 qiao and zhu 2019 sun et al 2018 sun et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 it also plays a vital role in different timescales of geological history bird et al 2014 chen et al 2013 hudson et al 2015 jonell et al 2020 liu et al 2021 shi et al 2017 zhu et al 2015 for instance the early holocene 11 2 8 6 ka highstands of ngangla ring tso were associated with the increased precipitation induced by an intensified ism while the lake level declines were correlated to the weak monsoonal precipitation hudson et al 2015 on suborbital timescales the broad highstands of nam co occurred in the early and middle holocene and have substantially decreased there are seven highstands at 11 9 11 0 8 3 6 7 5 1 4 2 3 4 2 4 and 1 1 ka on millennial timescales fig 5 a lake level variation pattern of nam co is broadly similar to those of the majority of tibetan lakes in the ism region e g selin co and ngangla ring tso within age uncertainties hou et al 2021 hudson et al 2015 luo et al 2021 shi et al 2017 the overall pattern coincides with the variation of the ism intensity fig 5b cai et al 2012 and moisture variations fig 5c chen et al 2019 on different timescales ism strengthened in the early and middle holocene and weakened thereafter as demonstrated by a combination of climatic proxies including stalagmites δ18o records from tianmen cave northwest of nam co fig 5b cai et al 2012 lacustrine sediments from southern and central parts of tp bird et al 2014 zhu et al 2015 peat δ13c records from eastern tp hong et al 2003 and marine sediment properties from the arabian sea gupta et al 2003 the intensified ism induced more monsoonal precipitation into the nam co catchment causing highstands during the early holocene and vice versa after the middle holocene recently the transient climate evolution of the last 21 ka trace 21 ka and kiel climate model kcm simulation results liu et al 2021 confirmed that lakes in the south central tp expanded to their highest levels during the early holocene when the solar induced ism was greatly intensified and that lake levels fell after the middle holocene when the ism weakened the most distinct pattern for the evolution of nam co is the periodical overflows during the early holocene and the closure during the middle and late holocene in this study three spilling events during the early holocene indicate a broad higher water level resulting from the increased precipitation associated with the intensified ism bird et al 2014 chen et al 2013 jonell et al 2020 liu et al 2021 shi et al 2017 zhu et al 2015 these spilling events hinder the use of lake levels in quantitatively reconstructing monsoonal precipitation as the response of lake level changes to climatic changes is nonlinear i e the lake level would remain at the elevation of the outlet even though the monsoonal precipitation keeps increasing consequently caution should be exercised when reconstructing the monsoonal precipitation changes based on lake level fluctuations of an exorheic lake 4 5 2 glacier meltwater apart from the monsoonal precipitation modern observation and simulation suggest that glacier meltwater has contributed significantly to the modern lake expansion in the past decades especially for the glacier fed lakes on the tp qiao and zhu 2019 sun et al 2018 sun et al 2020 zhu et al 2010 in the case of nam co more than 60 streams from the western nyainqentanglha mountains drain glacier meltwater directly into the lake although the area covered by glaciers in the nam co accounts for 2 of the catchment area biskop et al 2016 the contribution of meltwater to the total increased water storage accounted for more than 50 in recent years being equivalent to that of the precipitation qiao and zhu 2019 zhu et al 2010 2020 compared to the present day situation more extensive distributions of glaciers existed on the central tp during geological histories e g the lgm and early holocene dong et al 2018 schütt et al 2008 yan et al 2020 nyainqentanglha mountains glacier meltwater explained 50 of the post glaciation lake volume growth schütt et al 2008 during the warm periods e g the early holocene the rate of increase in water storage for most glacier fed lakes was much higher than that of non glacier fed lakes under the same climatic condition with a large amount of glacier meltwater flowing into the lakes on the contrary during the cold periods e g lia glacier fed lakes showed greater contraction than their non glacier fed lakes therefore glacier advance retreat enhances the amplitude of lake level variations during the holocene the extent of the glaciers on the southern and central tp was mainly above the present day level especially in the early and middle holocene yan et al 2020 the glacier activity directly responds to temperature changes on the central tp where glacier advance occurred at low temperatures and glacier retreat occurred at high temperatures chen et al 2020 liu et al 2014 ou et al 2014 consequently an early to middle holocene summer temperature maximum fig 5d chen et al 2020 induced by the strengthening of the suborbital scale solar irradiance berger and loutre 1991 may have quickly triggered the retreat of glaciers in the nam co catchment e g the nyainqentanglha mountains and generated more meltwater into nam co with the combination of both meltwater and greater monsoonal precipitation fig 5b and 5c nam co expanded until it periodically overflowed into ring co from 11 9 to 8 3 ka in the early holocene with two highstands at 6 7 and 5 1 ka in the middle holocene fig 3a during the late holocene the contribution of monsoonal precipitation decreased bird et al 2014 cai et al 2012 gupta et al 2003 zhu et al 2015 while nam co still had three highstands at ca 4 2 3 4 2 4 and 1 1 ka fig 3a corresponding to higher summer temperature intervals on the tp chen et al 2020 we propose that the increased meltwater was the main cause for these three highstands several studies have also proposed that glacier meltwater played a significant role in lake expansions and mega floods during the late holocene across the tp for example kalakuli lake a glacier fed lake on the pamir plateau westernmost tp experienced four highstands at 3 7 3 0 2 3 1 7 1 1 0 6 ka and the last 50 years fig 5e resulting from the increased meltwater as glaciers retreated liu et al 2014 large scale flood events of the keriya river in the northwestern margin of the tp occurred at 3 5 2 6 and 0 87 ka owing to increased glacier meltwater and or the outburst of glacier lakes an et al 2020 conversely during cold periods of the late holocene fig 5d large scale lake recessions occurred due to the decreased monsoonal precipitation and expanding glaciers during lia the climate conditions are regionally inconsistent atwood et al 2021 but numerous studies indicated that monsoonal precipitation reduced e g cai et al 2012 and glaciers advanced liu et al 2014 peng et al 2020 rowan 2017 on the tp during the transition from the warm and wet mwp to cold and dry lia therefore lake levels of nam co rapidly declined by at least 14 m at 1 1 0 51 ka fig 5a as a typical glacier fed lake nam co experienced frequent and abrupt lake level variations during the holocene on millennial timescales which were controlled by both monsoonal precipitation and glacier meltwater glacier retreat advance amplifies the relative magnitude of lake level fluctuations for glacier fed lakes when compared to non glacier fed lakes disrupting the direct relationship between lake level changes and monsoonal precipitation as a result caution should be taken when reconstructing the monsoonal precipitation using shoreline based lake level variations 5 conclusions based on thirty seven shoreline luminescence ages detailed holocene lake level variations of nam co were reconstructed nam co periodically overflowed during lake highstands during the early holocene 11 9 8 3 ka and then became closed thereafter seven highstands were identified at ca 11 9 11 0 8 3 6 7 5 1 4 2 3 4 2 4 and 1 1 ka which were concurrent with the na warmer intervals the dramatic lake level drop during the mwp lia transition indicates lake levels are sensitive to globally millennial scale climatic fluctuations the majority of earlier shorelines were buried by the later higher shoreline sediments therefore the complete lake level fluctuations would not be fully demonstrated if only the surficial shorelines were sampled the frequent and abrupt fluctuations of the glacier fed nam co could be explained by the combined repercussions of the monsoonal precipitation and glacier meltwater the glacier meltwater amplified the response of lake level fluctuations to climatic changes which makes the response nonlinear and more complicated consequently caution should be taken when reconstructing the holocene monsoonal precipitation

2224,joint operation of the reservoir system can greatly improve flood water utilization and alleviate the contradiction between water supply and water demand but yet the flood risk brought by forecast uncertainties transfers between the reservoirs and propagates from upstream to downstream which is crucial for flood water utilization but is rarely investigated to address this issue this study proposes a flwl optimal control framework which consists of three modules the flwl upper bound derivation module the flood risk analysis module and the optimal flwl decision making module the first module is to derive the upper bound relationship of the flood limited water level flwl i e the specific substitution relationship of storage for the parallel reservoirs coupling the capacity constrained pre release method and the aggregation decomposition method in the second module the method to calculate the flood risk of the reservoirs and downstream caused by rainfall and runoff forecast uncertainties based on the total probability formula is proposed in the third module the transmission and propagation of flood risks in the parallel reservoir system under different rainfall grades are quantified based on which the optimal flwls are determined the implication in the qinghe chaihe parallel reservoir system located in northeast china shows that flwl in qinghe reservoir and chaihe reservoir can be raised to 129 5 m from 127 m and 108 m from 104 m respectively controlling the flwl at any point in the safety domain can improve both flood water utilization and flood control benefits however the flood risk nonlinearly transfers between the parallel reservoirs and nonlinearly propagates from the upstream to the downstream based on this relationship the optimal flwls of the reservoirs under different decision preferences are recommended keywords parallel reservoirs flood water utilization dynamic control of flood limited water level flood risk transmission and propagation data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction drought the imbalance between water supply and demand has become a major limit on the sustainable development of the social economy and environmental protection ren et al 2016 xu et al 2020 in the context of climate change the frequency and intensity of hydrological extremes such as floods and droughts will increase mirza 2003 wang et al 2012 this could intensify the uneven distribution of water resources in spatial and temporal and exacerbate the water resource shortage liu et al 2018 yin et al 2022 flood water resource utilization is an effective measure to alleviate the contraction between water supply and water demand and the reservoir is the most efficient infrastructure the reservoir flood limited water level flwl which is set as a low value for flood prevention in flood season according to the chinese flood control act is the most significant parameter for flood water utilization yeh 1985 guo et al 2004 zhang et al 2019a traditionally flwl is set as one or several fixed values resulting in a large amount of abandoned water during the flood season and no water to be stored after the flood season windsor 1973 yun and singh 2008 zhou et al 2014 ding et al 2015 mo et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 to deal with such an issue dynamic control of flood limited water level dc flwl which allows flwl to fluctuate in a specific domain based on real time flood forecast information was proposed a number of researchers have proved that dc flwl can effectively improve flood water utilization without posing additional flood control risk li et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 jiang et al 2015 ding et al 2017 peng et al 2017 dc flwl of the multi reservoir system has a greater potential for flood water utilization than a single reservoir since there exists a storage compensation effect between reservoirs lu et al 2021 lu et al 2022 however only a few studies focus on the multi reservoir system chen et al 2013 and zhou et al 2014 preliminarily established dc flwl models for reservoir groups based on the aggregation decomposition method which can effectively improve the power generation benefit without decreasing flood control standards on this basis some researchers improved the multi reservoir dc flwl models such as considering the complexity of interval flows within the muskingum method zhang et al 2018 and extending the original single objective optimization to a multi objective one zhou et al 2018 the previous studies focus more on the improvement of dc flwl methods and directly derive the optimal flwl although the storage compensation is considered in the flwl derivation few studies have quantified the specific substitution relationship and the safety domain of flwl that is quantifying the compensation effect of the flood control storage within the reservoir system furthermore with the development of advanced technologies the quality of precipitation forecast information has improved significantly ran et al 2018 wang et al 2020 shu et al 2021 this can increase the decision space of the reservoir by extending the lead time to further improve the potential of flood water utilization of the reservoirs wang et al 2019 lu et al 2020 but forecast uncertainty is inevitable and might pose flood risks the multi reservoir system can control flood risks by dynamically allocating flood storage capacity based on the storage compensation between reservoirs lu et al 2021 however risks in the multi reservoir system are much more complicated to analyze and calculate than in a single reservoir especially the flood risk may transfer among reservoirs and propagate downstream through reservoir operations ding et al 2015 existing studies of the risk analysis and calculation within reservoir systems mainly focused on risk source identification chen et al 2020 lu et al 2022 risk analysis methods chen et al 2017 gong et al 2020 and the influence of uncertainties on reservoir operation decisions zhang et al 2019b lu et al 2021 in these studies researchers usually consider the uncertainty of runoff forecast and rarely couple the rainfall forecast uncertainties and more importantly most of them directly calculate the risk but few pay attention to the risk transmission and propagation mechanism within the reservoir systems which is the key to decision making to address the above issues this paper develops a framework to derive the upper bound relationship of flwls for the parallel reservoirs considering rainfall forecast and quantify the flood control risk of the system caused by forecast uncertainties with the framework the specific substitution relationship of the upper bound of flwls and the safety domain of flwl without posing additional flood control risks are derived the flood risk transmission relationship between the reservoirs and the propagation relationship from upstream and downstream are quantitively explored finally the optimal flwls under different decision preferences are recommended the parallel system of qinghe and chaihe reservoirs is taken as an illustrative case 2 methodology the dynamic control of flwl is implemented through a pre fill and pre release procedure based on forecasts to improve flood water utilization and water conservation benefits without posing additional flood control risks the concept of dc flwl considering rainfall forecast is illustrated as follows and shown in fig 1 in real time operation if no rainfall light rainfall or moderate rainfall is forecasted the storage originally reserved for flood control can be partially filled for water conservation benefits i e pre fill procedure if the forecast is heavy rainfall or torrential rainfall the refilled water should be released before a flood i e the pre release procedure if a flood event occurs the pre determined flood regulation rules will be undertaken to decrease the risk as much as possible i e flood regulation procedure therefore forecast information is essential for dc flwl however forecast uncertainties are inevitable in the real world and thus the refilled storage might not be released in time and then may give rise to increased flood risk therefore real time dc flwl must deal with the tradeoff between water conservation and flood control the primary task of dc flwl is to derive the upper bound of flwl for the reservoirs through flood risk analysis for the parallel reservoirs with common flood protection tasks if one reservoir pre fills more water i e less flood control capacity the other reservoirs must pre fill less i e more flood control capacity to guarantee flood control safety downstream therefore the quantitative substitution relationship between the flood control storage of the reservoirs in the parallel system that is the storage compensation should be investigated moreover with the change of flwl combinations flood risk may transfer between reservoirs and propagate from upstream to downstream the substation relationship and the risk transmission relationships are the basis and guidelines for real time operation and it is a major issue to be addressed in the reservoir system in the following sections the method for the derivation of the flwl upper bound relationship i e the substation relationship and the method for flood risk calculation are elaborated 2 1 derivation of the flwl upper bound relationship of the parallel reservoirs the premise of flood water utilization i e dc flwl is not to pose additional flood control risk therefore the derivation of the upper bound of flwl includes two steps the preliminary derivation of the flwl upper bound and the flood risk analysis at the upper bound the aggregation decomposition method is adopted to calculate the maximum available flood prevention storages for flood water utilization in the flood season considering rainfall forecast information of the parallel reservoirs shown in fig 2 and thus there are three steps consisting of aggregation decompensation and flood risk analysis the flood risk analysis is introduced in the next section first the aggregation method is to adjust the flwl from the designed flwl z d 0 to z with the capacity constrained pre release method the capacity constrained pre release module is that the allowable reservoir storage above the designed flwl can be improved as much as the discharge capacity during the forecast lead time shown as follows 1 w a m a x t 1 t y q out a t q in a t 2 s t f q out a t q qj t q an t where w a is the maximum allowable reservoir storage above the designed flwl of the aggregated reservoir t y is the effective forecast horizon which is the forecast horizon of the flood and rainfall minus the accumulated time for information transmission decision making and operation of the sluice gate q in a t and q out a t represent forecast inflow and outflow at time t of the aggregated reservoir q qj t is the interval inflow between the aggregated reservoir and the downstream protected object f q out a t represents the reservoir release evolving downstream the sum of f q out i t and q qj t should not be larger than the safety discharge rate to the downstream protected area q an t which denotes the maximum flow rate without flooding damage therefore w a is maximum when the reservoir releases water at the maximum flow rate q an t q qj t as shown in equation 1 the maximum allowable occupied flood control capacity for water conservation of a reservoir is determined by forecast information reflected by t y and q in a t and flood control standards reflected by q an t second the decomposition method is used to allocate the maximum available occupied flood prevention storage of the aggregated reservoir into the individual reservoirs and establish the flood prevention storage relationship between the parallel reservoirs the principle of the allocation is to guarantee the flood prevention standards of the whole system by utilizing the compensation relationship of the reservoir storage and the hydraulic connection between upstream and downstream 3 max z i

reservoir i f and v are the reservoir storage water level and water level storage relationships respectively q out i t and q in i t are outflow and inflow for reservoir i f q out i t represents the

and c 2 are the coefficients of the muskingum method f q out i t 1 represents the reservoir release evolving downstream at time t 1 the reverse successive estimation is applied to derive the upper bound of flwl for reservoir i when assuming the flwl of the other reservoirs and thus the flwl upper bound relationship can be preliminarily derived on this basis flood risk analysis of the preliminary flwl upper bound is conducted to satisfy the designed flood prevention standard 2 2 flood risk calculation considering forecast uncertainty in real time operation pre fill and pre release procedures are employed to dc flwl with rainfall forecast information when light rainfall is forecast flwl can be raised even up to the upper bound of flwl however the raised flwl may encounter a flood event due to the forecast uncertainty and may give rise to flood risk of the reservoir and downstream through reservoir flood regulation that is the forecast uncertainty is transformed to the reservoirs and downstream during the flood regulation procedure there are two scheduling methods considering forecast information or not when considering forecast during the flood regulating stage as shown in fig 1 i e using the flood control rules with forecasts the main flood risk source includes the rainfall forecast uncertainty during the pre fill and pre release stage and the flood forecast uncertainty during the flood control period the existence of rainfall and flood forecasting errors may lead to the risk event that the maximum reservoir water level exceeds the designed maximum water level z m i e flood risk of the reservoir and the risk event that the downstream streamflow exceeds the threshold q an i e flood risk of the downstream protected object 2 2 1 flood risk of the reservoir when the rainfall forecast is grade k the flood risk of flwl p zf p k r z d z m is the probability that the maximum reservoir water level exceeds the designed value z m and can be calculated with the law of total probability as shown in the following equation 8 p zf p k r z d z m j 1 n p zf p k z z d x p c z m δ e j p δ e j δ e j e j 1 e j j 1 n p δ e j 1 where δ e j denotes the jth flood forecast error interval p δ e j denotes the probability of forecast error interval δ e j x p c means the magnitude of rainfall with a probability of p c when rainfall forecast is grade k z z d x p c is the maximum reservoir water level of the flood caused by rainfall x p c with z d as the starting water level p zfp k z z d x p c z m δ e i denotes the probability of the maximum reservoir water level exceeding z m with rainfall forecast grade k and flood forecast error interval δ e j the probability p zfp k z z d x p c z m δ e j can be determined by the average of the probability at the two boundary points of the error interval 9 p zf p k z z d x p c z m δ e j p zf p k z z d x p c z m e j 1 p zf p k z z d x p c z m e j 2 where p zfp k z z d x p c z m e j expresses the probability of the maximum water level of the reservoir exceeding z m with flood forecast error of e j the procedures for flood risk calculation are shown in fig 3 and elaborated as follows a identify the rainfall forecast error distribution under different forecast grades i e no rainfall light rainfall moderate rainfall etc from the weather forecast product which often follows the p iii distribution b obtain the rainfall x p c i under the probability of p c i simulate the net rainfall and streamflow hydrograph caused by rainfall x p c i with a rainfall runoff hydrological model under the most unfavorable situation where the rainfall is concentrated in one period c identify the flood forecast error distribution which can be realized with the maximum entropy model then divide the error interval into n equal divisions e 0 e 1 e j e n 1 e n and calculate the corresponding occurrence frequency p δ e j d add e j to net rainfall and simulate the streamflow hydrograph with a united hydrograph e regulating the streamflow hydrograph obtained in step d with the regulating rule considering the forecast and the starting water level as z d and then obtain the maximum reservoir water level z z d x p c e j f repeat steps b e and we can obtain the relationship between the rainfall probability p c i and the maximum reservoir water level z z d x p c e j and then the probability of the maximum reservoir water level exceeding z m can be obtained shown in fig 3 f this probability is the flood control risk of the reservoir under runoff forecast error e j and rainfall forecast uncertainty that is p zfp k z z d x p c z m e j g repeat f and we can obtain the value p zfp k z z d x p c z m e j of all flood forecast errors e j and the value of p zf p k r z d z m can be calculated with equation 8 when no forecast information is considered for decision making during the flood regulation stage i e using the conventional flood control rules the main flood risk source only includes the rainfall forecast uncertainty during the pre fill and pre release stage and the flood risk of the reservoir is shown in equation 10 and can be calculated with steps a b e f and g 10 p zf p k z d z m p z z z d

flood risk when the streamflow exceeds the threshold the flood risk of a two reservoir system can be calculated as follows 11 p q p k r z d q an i 1 1 m 1 i 2 1 m 2 i n 1 m n p q q z d p c x q a n δ e

annual runoff of qinghe reservoir and chaihe reservoir are 5 08 108 m3 and 3 73 108 m3 from a catchment area of 2 376 km2 and 1 355 km2 respectively the primary purpose of the parallel reservoirs is flood control with water supply as the secondary purpose the current flood control operation adopts a static control of flwl without joint operation which results in a large amount of but probably not necessary spills during the flood season and low storage for water supply in the non flood season this motivates flood water utilization through the joint operation of qinghe and chaihe and the utilization of forecast information the flood control objective of the parallel reservoirs is to guarantee the flood safety of tieling city when encountering a flood with a recurrence of 100 year the safety discharge rate downstream in the tieling hydrology station is 6 800 m3 s meanwhile it also undertakes the task of staggering peak streamflow in the mainstream of liaohe with a flood recurrence of 30 years and the safety discharge rate in shifosi hydrology station is 5 500 m3 s tieling and shifosi hydrology stations are the common protection object of the parallel reservoirs while the kaiyuan hydrology station is the individual protection object of qinghe reservoir with a safety discharge rate of 5 000 m3 s for a recurrence of 50 year table 1 lists all the flood control standards and corresponding characteristic water levels of the two reservoirs table 2 shows the river routing parameters of the muskingum method from qinghe and chaihe reservoirs to the shifosi hydrology station downstream the xin anjiang rainfall runoff model is used for flood forecasting and the validation of the model performance is shown in appendix a 4 results and discussion 4 1 the flwl upper bound relationship of qinghe and chaihe reservoirs the 24 hour controlled value of the ensemble rainfall forecast product from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf https www ecmwf int from may oct during 2007 2017 is collected the rainfall data are classified into five grades according to the meteorological departments as shown in table b1 the rainfall forecast accuracy rate missing rate and vacancy rate given by equations b 1 b 3 under different rainfall grades in qinghe reservoir and chaihe reservoir are shown in fig 5 the forecast accuracy for no rain is high i e 94 and 97 for qinghe reservoir and chaihe reservoir respectively meanwhile the vacancy rate at different rainfall grades is high but it is relatively safe for flood control since larger rainfall forecasts induce larger reservoir release the rainfall forecast uncertainties i e the cumulative frequency of the actual rainfall under different rainfall forecast grades are derived following p iii distribution part of which is shown in fig b1 with the distribution the possible actual rainfall magnitude and its frequency under different forecast rainfall grades can be identified i e x pc in equation 8 listed in table b2 the maximum allowable reservoir storage of the aggregated reservoir can be calculated according to equations 1 and 2 in which the downstream safety streamflow q an represented by shifosi hydrologic station is 5 500 m3 s the effective forecast horizon is 17 h which is calculated by the rainfall forecast horizon of 24 h minus 5 h for information transmission decision making and operation of the sluice gate considering the intermediate flow the maximum allowable release from the aggregated reservoir is 2 018 5 m3 s and the corresponding maximum allowable storage is 94 03 106 m3 s then with the decomposition model shown in equations 3 to 7 the relationship between the upper bound of flwl for qinghe reservoir and chaihe reservoir can be derived as shown in fig 6 as can be seen to guarantee flood safety downstream lower flood control storage in qinghe reservoir requires higher flood control storage in chaihe reservoir and vice versa the relationship of the upper bound of flwls between the two reservoirs is nonlinear due to the nonlinear relationship between reservoir water level and storage the upper bound of flwl for chaihe reservoir is maximum at 108 m when the flwl for qinghe reservoir is at the original designed value of 127 m and the upper bound of flwl for qinghe reservoir is maximum at 129 5 m when the flwl for chaihe reservoir is at the original designed value of 104 m 4 2 flood risk caused by forecast uncertainty at the upper bound of flwl all the points in the region surrounded by the upper bound curve and the coordinate axis in fig 6 should be analyzed to answer whether the flood safety of the system can be guaranteed the protected objects of the flood control system include reservoirs and their upstream and downstream in this study the forecast uncertainty in the intermediate region is not considered and all the flood hydrographs of the reservoir are regulated with the designed flood operating rule in which the release does not exceed the downstream threshold that is flood safety downstream can be ensured furthermore higher flwl brings a larger flood risk and thus if the flood risk of the reservoir at the maximum flwl is not larger than the designed risk then the flood risk of all the combinations along the curve and within the region surrounded by the curve are compliant with flood protection requirements therefore we first analyze the flood risk at the maximum upper bound of flwl i e 129 5 m and 108 m for qinghe reservoir and chaihe reservoir respectively the risk analysis is elaborated for chaihe reservoir with the moderate rainfall forecast and flwl at 108 m the maximum water level of the reservoir under different probabilities of rainfall and flood forecast error is shown in fig 7 a as can be seen the maximum water level of the reservoir is higher with larger rainfall and flood forecast error and the frequency that the maximum reservoir water level exceeds the characteristic water level i e 111 8 m is the flood risk i e p zfp k z z d x p c z m e j in equation 8 for example p zfp k of 111 8 m is 0 002 when the relative runoff forecast error is 0 2 therefore the flood risk for different characteristic water levels under different levels of runoff forecast error can be derived shown in fig 7 b as can be seen the flood risk is higher when the forecast runoff is smaller than the actual runoff i e a negative forecast error and the flood risk of a higher maximum water level is smaller with fig 7 b the flood risk of different characteristic water levels can be calculated considering both the rainfall and runoff forecast uncertainties with the total probability formula i e equation 8 the flood risk of different characteristic water levels under different rainfall forecast grades is shown in fig 8 in which the gray curves represent the originally designed flood risk as can be seen for the moderate and smaller rainfall when flwl is raised to the upper bound of 108 m and 129 5 m for chaihe reservoir and qinghe reservoir the flood risk is smaller than the designed flood risk the results implicate that it is safe to raise the flwl to 108 m and 129 5 m when the forecast rainfall is moderate or smaller that is to say the region surrounded by the horizontal and vertical coordinates and the upper bound curve in fig 6 are the safety domain for flwl and can not only improve the conservation benefit but also improve the flood control benefit through joint operation considering forecast information all the points within the region can improve flood water conservation and the closer to the origin the smaller the flood risk and conservation benefit on the contrary the closer to the upper bound of the flwl curve the higher the conservation benefit but also the larger the flood risk fig 8 also shows the flood risk when the flood is regulated with the conventional dispatching rules the details of the rules are demonstrated in appendix d and with the dispatching rules considering forecast but with perfect flood forecast as can be seen all the dot dashed lines locate below the dashed lines this demonstrates that when the flood forecast is perfect the flood risk of the dispatching rule considering the forecast i e coupling the rainfall and runoff forecast information is smaller than that only considering rainfall forecast information however when there is flood forecast uncertainty the flood risk of the dispatching rule considering the forecast might be higher or lower than that of the conventional scheduling method as shown in fig 8 that the short dashed line may be above or below the long dashed line the reason is that forecast uncertainty may lead to a smaller forecast inflow which leads to a smaller discharge but a higher water level and smaller flood control capacity and thus the flood risk is higher on the contrary there might also be a larger forecast inflow which leads to a smaller flood risk the results indicate that the dispatching rule considering forecast is not always beneficial that is the flood forecast cannot always bring benefits due to the forecast uncertainty for qinghe reservoir when flwl is at 129 5 m the flood risk is smaller with the dispatching rule considering the forecast when no rain or light rain is forecasted when moderate rainfall is forecasted the flood risk is smaller with the conventual dispatching method for chaihe reservoir the flood risk of the dispatching rule considering the forecast for moderate rainfall and the conventual dispatching rule for light rainfall is smaller this result guides the utilization of flood forecasts and the selection of the flood control operation rule 4 3 flood risk transmission between reservoirs according to the above analysis when moderate or light rainfall is forecasted the flood risk of all the points along the upper bound flwl relationship in fig 6 is smaller than the designed risk that is the flood control capacity reserved for the safety of downstream and reservoir is adequate however though the system is safe the flood risk between the reservoirs is different for different storage allocation scenarios i e different points in the region of fig 6 more storage in one reservoir means less storage in the other one and more storage brings a higher flood risk that is different flood control storage allocation schemes indicate flood risk transmission between reservoirs based on the flwl upper bound curve 41 scenarios of flwls are obtained by increasing the flwl of chaihe reservoir by 0 1 m from 104 m to 108 m the flood risks of 41 scenarios under different characteristic water levels are shown in figs 9 and 10 as shown in the figure the flood risk in qinghe reservoir nonlinearly decreases with that of chaihe reservoir i e different flood control storage allocation scenarios lead to a nonlinear transmission relationship of flood risks in the parallel reservoirs for the light rainfall forecast scenario when flwl locates in region a in fig 10 a i e the flwl ranges in 129 5 128 3 m for qinghe reservoir and 104 0 106 2 m for chaihe reservoir a slight increase in the flood risk of chaihe reservoir can greatly decrease the flood risk of qinghe reservoir while when flwl locates in region b that flwl ranges in 127 4 127 0 m for qinghe reservoir and 107 4 108 m for chaihe reservoir a slight decrease in the flood risk of qinghe reservoir induces a great increase of flood risk in chaihe reservoir in addition as shown in fig 9 especially in fig 9 a the flood risk transmission curve is discontinuous which is caused by the mutations in the variation curve of flood risk with flwl in fig 10 as shown in fig 10 a that the flood risk in qinghe reservoir dramatically increases with flwl changing from 127 4 m to 127 5 m and the flood risk in chaihe reservoir dramatically increases with flwl changing from 106 6 m to 106 7 m and instead dramatically decreases from 107 9 m to 108 m the reason for the dramatically increasing flood risk is due to the peak staggering regulation of the reservoir for example when flwl in chaihe reservoir is 106 7 m the 3rd discharge operation of no discharge for chaihe reservoir shown in appendix d is triggered while it is not triggered when flwl is 106 6 m thus the maximum reservoir water level is much higher when flwl is 106 7 m the reason for dramatically decrease is that a greater discharge operation is triggered for example when flwl in chaihe reservoir is 108 m the maximum reservoir water level is higher than 111 8 m when encountering a flood with a rainfall omission probability of 0 001 and relative runoff forecast error of 0 6 for a light rainfall forecast and thus the 5th discharge operation is triggered and then the discharge is higher than the inflow shown in fig 11 therefore the maximum reservoir water level instead decreases it is worth mentioning that the flood risk transmission between reservoirs under different flood control standards is similar with the same flwl ranges in each region as shown by the different curves in fig 9 and different sub figures in fig 10 in conclusion based on the quantitative flood risk transmission relationship between the parallel reservoirs the satisfied flwls can be determined according to the decision maker s preference the following suggestions and guidelines for the dynamic control of flwl are put forward based on the marginal utility principle when light or moderate rainfall is forecasted a when light rainfall is forecasted if more emphasis is on flood control safety in chaihe reservoir the flwl for chaihe should be lower than 106 2 m and qinghe higher than 128 3 m if decision makers are more concerned about the flood control safety in qinghe reservoir the flwl for qinghe should be lower than 127 4 m and chaihe higher than 107 4 m if to balance the flood risk in the two reservoirs the flwl should be in the range of 127 4 128 3 m and 106 2 107 4 m in qinghe reservoir and chaihe reservoir respectively b when moderate rainfall is forecasted if more emphasis is on flood control safety in chaihe reservoir the flwl for chaihe should be lower than 105 7 m and qinghe higher than 128 6 m if decision makers are more concerned about the flood control safety in qinghe reservoir the flwl for qinghe should be lower than 128 0 m and chaihe higher than 106 6 m if to balance the flood risk in the two reservoirs the flwl should be in the range of 105 8 106 5 m and 128 1 128 5 m in chaihe reservoir and qinghe reservoir respectively similar suggestions can be drawn for no rainfall forecasts 4 4 flood risk propagation from upstream to downstream the flood risk propagates from upstream to downstream through reservoir discharge under different storage capacity allocation schemes the safety streamflow rate downstream i e represented by the shifosi hydrology station with a recurrence interval of 20 years is 5 500 m3 s which is used as the standard for dc flwl the corresponding safety discharge from the reservoir is 2 766 m3 s which is the most unfavorable situation the discharge from the parallel reservoir accounts for the minimum the flood risk rate downstream under different storage capacity allocation schemes is demonstrated in fig 12 as displayed in the figure the flood risk downstream shows a trend of first increasing and then decreasing with the decrease of flood control storage of any reservoir that is with the increase of flwl of any reservoir meanwhile the flood risk propagation relationship from upstream to downstream is nonlinear and the variation with flwl can be divided into three regions shown as a b and c regions in fig 12 the downstream flood risk in regions a and c varies greatly with the flwl of the reservoir while that in region b is gentle with the nonlinear quantitative propagation relationship of flood risk the satisfied flwl can be determined according to the decision maker s preference here we draw the following conclusions and implications with the marginal utility principle when moderate rainfall or light rainfall is forecasted the downstream flood risk is relatively high when the flood control storage between the two reservoirs is evenly allocated and conversely the flood risk is low when moderate rainfall is forecasted to guarantee a low risk downstream the flwl of chaihe reservoir should be within the range of 104 0 105 7 m or 106 6 108 0 m and that of qinghe reservoir is 127 0 127 9 m or 128 6 129 5 m when light rainfall is forecasted the range of flwl for chaihe reservoir is 104 0 104 6 m or 107 4 108 0 m and that of qinghe reservoir is 129 2 129 5 m or 127 0 127 4 m 5 conclusions this paper concentrated on the flood water utilization of the parallel reservoirs based on the concept of dynamic control of flwl dc flwl and analyzed the flood risk caused by forecast uncertainties the flwl optimal control framework consisting of the flwl upper bound derivation module the flood risk analysis module and the optimal flwl decision making module is developed firstly the upper bound relationship of the parallel reservoirs is derived by coupling the capacity constrained pre release method and the aggregation decomposition method considering rainfall forecasts then the flood risks of the reservoir and downstream caused by forecast uncertainties are calculated with the total probability formula third the transmission and propagation of flood risk in the system are elaborated and based on this the optimal flwls under different decision making preferences are recommended the qinghe and chaihe parallel reservoir system located in northeast china is taken as a case study results show that there exists a nonlinear relationship between the upper bounds of flwl in the two reservoirs when considering 24 hour rainfall forecasts the maximum flwl of the qinghe and chaihe reservoirs can be raised to 129 5 m from 127 m and 108 m from 104 m respectively and the flood risks at the upper bound of flwl are all lower than that of the designed flwl the results indicate that on the one hand the joint operation of the parallel reservoir and the utilization of 24 hour rainfall forecasts can both improve the water conservation benefits and the flood control benefits on the other hand it is safe to control the flwl in the domain surrounded by the upper bound flwl curve when the 24 hour rainfall forecast is not higher than the moderate grade moreover the flood risk nonlinearly transfers between the reservoirs and nonlinearly propagates from the upstream to the downstream with the nonlinear transmission and propagation relationship of flood risk the satisfied flwls can be determined according to the decision maker s preference for example to guarantee a low risk downstream the flwl of chaihe reservoir should be within the range of 104 105 7 m or 106 6 108 m and that of qinghe reservoir is 127 127 9 m or 128 6 129 5 m when moderate rainfall is forecasted the framework proposed in this paper is appropriate for parallel reservoirs and can be extended to parallel systems in the real world the system often consists of both parallel reservoirs and cascaded reservoirs there exists a higher potential for flood water utilization but the flood risk transmission and propagation in the system are more complicated further research is required to extend the framework to a more complex reservoir system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments this research is supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51925902 u2240204 52079015 appendix a performance of the rainfall runoff hydrological model the xin anjiang rainfall runoff model xaj model developed by zhao 1992 is used in this study for flood forecasting a total of 22 historical floods from 1964 to 2013 are used for the model construction of qinghe reservoir among which 17 floods from 1964 to 2008 are used for calibration and the remaining 5 floods are used for validation in chaihe reservoir 20 floods from 1973 to 2013 in chaihe basin are applied in the model among them 16 floods that occurred before 2006 are used for parameter calibration and 4 floods that occurred between 2007 and 2013 are used for validation tables a1 and a2 list the optimized parameters of the xaj model for qinghe and chaihe reservoirs respectively and figs a1 and a2 show the results of the calibration and verification period in the figures the dotted lines represent the acceptable relative errors of 20 as shown in figs a1 and a2 only one relative peak flow error and one relative runoff error exceed the acceptable 20 in the verification and calibration period respectively and the runoff error of one calibrated flood is slightly 20 therefore the models are good in flood simulations and can be used for flood forecasting of qinghe and chaihe reservoirs appendix b rainfall forecast uncertainty the 24 hour controlled value of the ensemble rainfall forecast product

2224,joint operation of the reservoir system can greatly improve flood water utilization and alleviate the contradiction between water supply and water demand but yet the flood risk brought by forecast uncertainties transfers between the reservoirs and propagates from upstream to downstream which is crucial for flood water utilization but is rarely investigated to address this issue this study proposes a flwl optimal control framework which consists of three modules the flwl upper bound derivation module the flood risk analysis module and the optimal flwl decision making module the first module is to derive the upper bound relationship of the flood limited water level flwl i e the specific substitution relationship of storage for the parallel reservoirs coupling the capacity constrained pre release method and the aggregation decomposition method in the second module the method to calculate the flood risk of the reservoirs and downstream caused by rainfall and runoff forecast uncertainties based on the total probability formula is proposed in the third module the transmission and propagation of flood risks in the parallel reservoir system under different rainfall grades are quantified based on which the optimal flwls are determined the implication in the qinghe chaihe parallel reservoir system located in northeast china shows that flwl in qinghe reservoir and chaihe reservoir can be raised to 129 5 m from 127 m and 108 m from 104 m respectively controlling the flwl at any point in the safety domain can improve both flood water utilization and flood control benefits however the flood risk nonlinearly transfers between the parallel reservoirs and nonlinearly propagates from the upstream to the downstream based on this relationship the optimal flwls of the reservoirs under different decision preferences are recommended keywords parallel reservoirs flood water utilization dynamic control of flood limited water level flood risk transmission and propagation data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction drought the imbalance between water supply and demand has become a major limit on the sustainable development of the social economy and environmental protection ren et al 2016 xu et al 2020 in the context of climate change the frequency and intensity of hydrological extremes such as floods and droughts will increase mirza 2003 wang et al 2012 this could intensify the uneven distribution of water resources in spatial and temporal and exacerbate the water resource shortage liu et al 2018 yin et al 2022 flood water resource utilization is an effective measure to alleviate the contraction between water supply and water demand and the reservoir is the most efficient infrastructure the reservoir flood limited water level flwl which is set as a low value for flood prevention in flood season according to the chinese flood control act is the most significant parameter for flood water utilization yeh 1985 guo et al 2004 zhang et al 2019a traditionally flwl is set as one or several fixed values resulting in a large amount of abandoned water during the flood season and no water to be stored after the flood season windsor 1973 yun and singh 2008 zhou et al 2014 ding et al 2015 mo et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 to deal with such an issue dynamic control of flood limited water level dc flwl which allows flwl to fluctuate in a specific domain based on real time flood forecast information was proposed a number of researchers have proved that dc flwl can effectively improve flood water utilization without posing additional flood control risk li et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 jiang et al 2015 ding et al 2017 peng et al 2017 dc flwl of the multi reservoir system has a greater potential for flood water utilization than a single reservoir since there exists a storage compensation effect between reservoirs lu et al 2021 lu et al 2022 however only a few studies focus on the multi reservoir system chen et al 2013 and zhou et al 2014 preliminarily established dc flwl models for reservoir groups based on the aggregation decomposition method which can effectively improve the power generation benefit without decreasing flood control standards on this basis some researchers improved the multi reservoir dc flwl models such as considering the complexity of interval flows within the muskingum method zhang et al 2018 and extending the original single objective optimization to a multi objective one zhou et al 2018 the previous studies focus more on the improvement of dc flwl methods and directly derive the optimal flwl although the storage compensation is considered in the flwl derivation few studies have quantified the specific substitution relationship and the safety domain of flwl that is quantifying the compensation effect of the flood control storage within the reservoir system furthermore with the development of advanced technologies the quality of precipitation forecast information has improved significantly ran et al 2018 wang et al 2020 shu et al 2021 this can increase the decision space of the reservoir by extending the lead time to further improve the potential of flood water utilization of the reservoirs wang et al 2019 lu et al 2020 but forecast uncertainty is inevitable and might pose flood risks the multi reservoir system can control flood risks by dynamically allocating flood storage capacity based on the storage compensation between reservoirs lu et al 2021 however risks in the multi reservoir system are much more complicated to analyze and calculate than in a single reservoir especially the flood risk may transfer among reservoirs and propagate downstream through reservoir operations ding et al 2015 existing studies of the risk analysis and calculation within reservoir systems mainly focused on risk source identification chen et al 2020 lu et al 2022 risk analysis methods chen et al 2017 gong et al 2020 and the influence of uncertainties on reservoir operation decisions zhang et al 2019b lu et al 2021 in these studies researchers usually consider the uncertainty of runoff forecast and rarely couple the rainfall forecast uncertainties and more importantly most of them directly calculate the risk but few pay attention to the risk transmission and propagation mechanism within the reservoir systems which is the key to decision making to address the above issues this paper develops a framework to derive the upper bound relationship of flwls for the parallel reservoirs considering rainfall forecast and quantify the flood control risk of the system caused by forecast uncertainties with the framework the specific substitution relationship of the upper bound of flwls and the safety domain of flwl without posing additional flood control risks are derived the flood risk transmission relationship between the reservoirs and the propagation relationship from upstream and downstream are quantitively explored finally the optimal flwls under different decision preferences are recommended the parallel system of qinghe and chaihe reservoirs is taken as an illustrative case 2 methodology the dynamic control of flwl is implemented through a pre fill and pre release procedure based on forecasts to improve flood water utilization and water conservation benefits without posing additional flood control risks the concept of dc flwl considering rainfall forecast is illustrated as follows and shown in fig 1 in real time operation if no rainfall light rainfall or moderate rainfall is forecasted the storage originally reserved for flood control can be partially filled for water conservation benefits i e pre fill procedure if the forecast is heavy rainfall or torrential rainfall the refilled water should be released before a flood i e the pre release procedure if a flood event occurs the pre determined flood regulation rules will be undertaken to decrease the risk as much as possible i e flood regulation procedure therefore forecast information is essential for dc flwl however forecast uncertainties are inevitable in the real world and thus the refilled storage might not be released in time and then may give rise to increased flood risk therefore real time dc flwl must deal with the tradeoff between water conservation and flood control the primary task of dc flwl is to derive the upper bound of flwl for the reservoirs through flood risk analysis for the parallel reservoirs with common flood protection tasks if one reservoir pre fills more water i e less flood control capacity the other reservoirs must pre fill less i e more flood control capacity to guarantee flood control safety downstream therefore the quantitative substitution relationship between the flood control storage of the reservoirs in the parallel system that is the storage compensation should be investigated moreover with the change of flwl combinations flood risk may transfer between reservoirs and propagate from upstream to downstream the substation relationship and the risk transmission relationships are the basis and guidelines for real time operation and it is a major issue to be addressed in the reservoir system in the following sections the method for the derivation of the flwl upper bound relationship i e the substation relationship and the method for flood risk calculation are elaborated 2 1 derivation of the flwl upper bound relationship of the parallel reservoirs the premise of flood water utilization i e dc flwl is not to pose additional flood control risk therefore the derivation of the upper bound of flwl includes two steps the preliminary derivation of the flwl upper bound and the flood risk analysis at the upper bound the aggregation decomposition method is adopted to calculate the maximum available flood prevention storages for flood water utilization in the flood season considering rainfall forecast information of the parallel reservoirs shown in fig 2 and thus there are three steps consisting of aggregation decompensation and flood risk analysis the flood risk analysis is introduced in the next section first the aggregation method is to adjust the flwl from the designed flwl z d 0 to z with the capacity constrained pre release method the capacity constrained pre release module is that the allowable reservoir storage above the designed flwl can be improved as much as the discharge capacity during the forecast lead time shown as follows 1 w a m a x t 1 t y q out a t q in a t 2 s t f q out a t q qj t q an t where w a is the maximum allowable reservoir storage above the designed flwl of the aggregated reservoir t y is the effective forecast horizon which is the forecast horizon of the flood and rainfall minus the accumulated time for information transmission decision making and operation of the sluice gate q in a t and q out a t represent forecast inflow and outflow at time t of the aggregated reservoir q qj t is the interval inflow between the aggregated reservoir and the downstream protected object f q out a t represents the reservoir release evolving downstream the sum of f q out i t and q qj t should not be larger than the safety discharge rate to the downstream protected area q an t which denotes the maximum flow rate without flooding damage therefore w a is maximum when the reservoir releases water at the maximum flow rate q an t q qj t as shown in equation 1 the maximum allowable occupied flood control capacity for water conservation of a reservoir is determined by forecast information reflected by t y and q in a t and flood control standards reflected by q an t second the decomposition method is used to allocate the maximum available occupied flood prevention storage of the aggregated reservoir into the individual reservoirs and establish the flood prevention storage relationship between the parallel reservoirs the principle of the allocation is to guarantee the flood prevention standards of the whole system by utilizing the compensation relationship of the reservoir storage and the hydraulic connection between upstream and downstream 3 max z i

reservoir i f and v are the reservoir storage water level and water level storage relationships respectively q out i t and q in i t are outflow and inflow for reservoir i f q out i t represents the

and c 2 are the coefficients of the muskingum method f q out i t 1 represents the reservoir release evolving downstream at time t 1 the reverse successive estimation is applied to derive the upper bound of flwl for reservoir i when assuming the flwl of the other reservoirs and thus the flwl upper bound relationship can be preliminarily derived on this basis flood risk analysis of the preliminary flwl upper bound is conducted to satisfy the designed flood prevention standard 2 2 flood risk calculation considering forecast uncertainty in real time operation pre fill and pre release procedures are employed to dc flwl with rainfall forecast information when light rainfall is forecast flwl can be raised even up to the upper bound of flwl however the raised flwl may encounter a flood event due to the forecast uncertainty and may give rise to flood risk of the reservoir and downstream through reservoir flood regulation that is the forecast uncertainty is transformed to the reservoirs and downstream during the flood regulation procedure there are two scheduling methods considering forecast information or not when considering forecast during the flood regulating stage as shown in fig 1 i e using the flood control rules with forecasts the main flood risk source includes the rainfall forecast uncertainty during the pre fill and pre release stage and the flood forecast uncertainty during the flood control period the existence of rainfall and flood forecasting errors may lead to the risk event that the maximum reservoir water level exceeds the designed maximum water level z m i e flood risk of the reservoir and the risk event that the downstream streamflow exceeds the threshold q an i e flood risk of the downstream protected object 2 2 1 flood risk of the reservoir when the rainfall forecast is grade k the flood risk of flwl p zf p k r z d z m is the probability that the maximum reservoir water level exceeds the designed value z m and can be calculated with the law of total probability as shown in the following equation 8 p zf p k r z d z m j 1 n p zf p k z z d x p c z m δ e j p δ e j δ e j e j 1 e j j 1 n p δ e j 1 where δ e j denotes the jth flood forecast error interval p δ e j denotes the probability of forecast error interval δ e j x p c means the magnitude of rainfall with a probability of p c when rainfall forecast is grade k z z d x p c is the maximum reservoir water level of the flood caused by rainfall x p c with z d as the starting water level p zfp k z z d x p c z m δ e i denotes the probability of the maximum reservoir water level exceeding z m with rainfall forecast grade k and flood forecast error interval δ e j the probability p zfp k z z d x p c z m δ e j can be determined by the average of the probability at the two boundary points of the error interval 9 p zf p k z z d x p c z m δ e j p zf p k z z d x p c z m e j 1 p zf p k z z d x p c z m e j 2 where p zfp k z z d x p c z m e j expresses the probability of the maximum water level of the reservoir exceeding z m with flood forecast error of e j the procedures for flood risk calculation are shown in fig 3 and elaborated as follows a identify the rainfall forecast error distribution under different forecast grades i e no rainfall light rainfall moderate rainfall etc from the weather forecast product which often follows the p iii distribution b obtain the rainfall x p c i under the probability of p c i simulate the net rainfall and streamflow hydrograph caused by rainfall x p c i with a rainfall runoff hydrological model under the most unfavorable situation where the rainfall is concentrated in one period c identify the flood forecast error distribution which can be realized with the maximum entropy model then divide the error interval into n equal divisions e 0 e 1 e j e n 1 e n and calculate the corresponding occurrence frequency p δ e j d add e j to net rainfall and simulate the streamflow hydrograph with a united hydrograph e regulating the streamflow hydrograph obtained in step d with the regulating rule considering the forecast and the starting water level as z d and then obtain the maximum reservoir water level z z d x p c e j f repeat steps b e and we can obtain the relationship between the rainfall probability p c i and the maximum reservoir water level z z d x p c e j and then the probability of the maximum reservoir water level exceeding z m can be obtained shown in fig 3 f this probability is the flood control risk of the reservoir under runoff forecast error e j and rainfall forecast uncertainty that is p zfp k z z d x p c z m e j g repeat f and we can obtain the value p zfp k z z d x p c z m e j of all flood forecast errors e j and the value of p zf p k r z d z m can be calculated with equation 8 when no forecast information is considered for decision making during the flood regulation stage i e using the conventional flood control rules the main flood risk source only includes the rainfall forecast uncertainty during the pre fill and pre release stage and the flood risk of the reservoir is shown in equation 10 and can be calculated with steps a b e f and g 10 p zf p k z d z m p z z z d x p c z m 2 2 2 flood risk at downstream the release at the downstream protected object comes from the reservoir release of the parallel reservoirs and the intermediate inflow there is downstream flood risk when the streamflow exceeds the threshold the flood risk of a two reservoir system can be calculated as follows 11 p q p k r z d q an i 1 1 m 1 i 2 1 m 2 i n 1 m n p q q z d p c x q a n δ e

annual runoff of qinghe reservoir and chaihe reservoir are 5 08 108 m3 and 3 73 108 m3 from a catchment area of 2 376 km2 and 1 355 km2 respectively the primary purpose of the parallel reservoirs is flood control with water supply as the secondary purpose the current flood control operation adopts a static control of flwl without joint operation which results in a large amount of but probably not necessary spills during the flood season and low storage for water supply in the non flood season this motivates flood water utilization through the joint operation of qinghe and chaihe and the utilization of forecast information the flood control objective of the parallel reservoirs is to guarantee the flood safety of tieling city when encountering a flood with a recurrence of 100 year the safety discharge rate downstream in the tieling hydrology station is 6 800 m3 s meanwhile it also undertakes the task of staggering peak streamflow in the mainstream of liaohe with a flood recurrence of 30 years and the safety discharge rate in shifosi hydrology station is 5 500 m3 s tieling and shifosi hydrology stations are the common protection object of the parallel reservoirs while the kaiyuan hydrology station is the individual protection object of qinghe reservoir with a safety discharge rate of 5 000 m3 s for a recurrence of 50 year table 1 lists all the flood control standards and corresponding characteristic water levels of the two reservoirs table 2 shows the river routing parameters of the muskingum method from qinghe and chaihe reservoirs to the shifosi hydrology station downstream the xin anjiang rainfall runoff model is used for flood forecasting and the validation of the model performance is shown in appendix a 4 results and discussion 4 1 the flwl upper bound relationship of qinghe and chaihe reservoirs the 24 hour controlled value of the ensemble rainfall forecast product from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf https www ecmwf int from may oct during 2007 2017 is collected the rainfall data are classified into five grades according to the meteorological departments as shown in table b1 the rainfall forecast accuracy rate missing rate and vacancy rate given by equations b 1 b 3 under different rainfall grades in qinghe reservoir and chaihe reservoir are shown in fig 5 the forecast accuracy for no rain is high i e 94 and 97 for qinghe reservoir and chaihe reservoir respectively meanwhile the vacancy rate at different rainfall grades is high but it is relatively safe for flood control since larger rainfall forecasts induce larger reservoir release the rainfall forecast uncertainties i e the cumulative frequency of the actual rainfall under different rainfall forecast grades are derived following p iii distribution part of which is shown in fig b1 with the distribution the possible actual rainfall magnitude and its frequency under different forecast rainfall grades can be identified i e x pc in equation 8 listed in table b2 the maximum allowable reservoir storage of the aggregated reservoir can be calculated according to equations 1 and 2 in which the downstream safety streamflow q an represented by shifosi hydrologic station is 5 500 m3 s the effective forecast horizon is 17 h which is calculated by the rainfall forecast horizon of 24 h minus 5 h for information transmission decision making and operation of the sluice gate considering the intermediate flow the maximum allowable release from the aggregated reservoir is 2 018 5 m3 s and the corresponding maximum allowable storage is 94 03 106 m3 s then with the decomposition model shown in equations 3 to 7 the relationship between the upper bound of flwl for qinghe reservoir and chaihe reservoir can be derived as shown in fig 6 as can be seen to guarantee flood safety downstream lower flood control storage in qinghe reservoir requires higher flood control storage in chaihe reservoir and vice versa the relationship of the upper bound of flwls between the two reservoirs is nonlinear due to the nonlinear relationship between reservoir water level and storage the upper bound of flwl for chaihe reservoir is maximum at 108 m when the flwl for qinghe reservoir is at the original designed value of 127 m and the upper bound of flwl for qinghe reservoir is maximum at 129 5 m when the flwl for chaihe reservoir is at the original designed value of 104 m 4 2 flood risk caused by forecast uncertainty at the upper bound of flwl all the points in the region surrounded by the upper bound curve and the coordinate axis in fig 6 should be analyzed to answer whether the flood safety of the system can be guaranteed the protected objects of the flood control system include reservoirs and their upstream and downstream in this study the forecast uncertainty in the intermediate region is not considered and all the flood hydrographs of the reservoir are regulated with the designed flood operating rule in which the release does not exceed the downstream threshold that is flood safety downstream can be ensured furthermore higher flwl brings a larger flood risk and thus if the flood risk of the reservoir at the maximum flwl is not larger than the designed risk then the flood risk of all the combinations along the curve and within the region surrounded by the curve are compliant with flood protection requirements therefore we first analyze the flood risk at the maximum upper bound of flwl i e 129 5 m and 108 m for qinghe reservoir and chaihe reservoir respectively the risk analysis is elaborated for chaihe reservoir with the moderate rainfall forecast and flwl at 108 m the maximum water level of the reservoir under different probabilities of rainfall and flood forecast error is shown in fig 7 a as can be seen the maximum water level of the reservoir is higher with larger rainfall and flood forecast error and the frequency that the maximum reservoir water level exceeds the characteristic water level i e 111 8 m is the flood risk i e p zfp k z z d x p c z m e j in equation 8 for example p zfp k of 111 8 m is 0 002 when the relative runoff forecast error is 0 2 therefore the flood risk for different characteristic water levels under different levels of runoff forecast error can be derived shown in fig 7 b as can be seen the flood risk is higher when the forecast runoff is smaller than the actual runoff i e a negative forecast error and the flood risk of a higher maximum water level is smaller with fig 7 b the flood risk of different characteristic water levels can be calculated considering both the rainfall and runoff forecast uncertainties with the total probability formula i e equation 8 the flood risk of different characteristic water levels under different rainfall forecast grades is shown in fig 8 in which the gray curves represent the originally designed flood risk as can be seen for the moderate and smaller rainfall when flwl is raised to the upper bound of 108 m and 129 5 m for chaihe reservoir and qinghe reservoir the flood risk is smaller than the designed flood risk the results implicate that it is safe to raise the flwl to 108 m and 129 5 m when the forecast rainfall is moderate or smaller that is to say the region surrounded by the horizontal and vertical coordinates and the upper bound curve in fig 6 are the safety domain for flwl and can not only improve the conservation benefit but also improve the flood control benefit through joint operation considering forecast information all the points within the region can improve flood water conservation and the closer to the origin the smaller the flood risk and conservation benefit on the contrary the closer to the upper bound of the flwl curve the higher the conservation benefit but also the larger the flood risk fig 8 also shows the flood risk when the flood is regulated with the conventional dispatching rules the details of the rules are demonstrated in appendix d and with the dispatching rules considering forecast but with perfect flood forecast as can be seen all the dot dashed lines locate below the dashed lines this demonstrates that when the flood forecast is perfect the flood risk of the dispatching rule considering the forecast i e coupling the rainfall and runoff forecast information is smaller than that only considering rainfall forecast information however when there is flood forecast uncertainty the flood risk of the dispatching rule considering the forecast might be higher or lower than that of the conventional scheduling method as shown in fig 8 that the short dashed line may be above or below the long dashed line the reason is that forecast uncertainty may lead to a smaller forecast inflow which leads to a smaller discharge but a higher water level and smaller flood control capacity and thus the flood risk is higher on the contrary there might also be a larger forecast inflow which leads to a smaller flood risk the results indicate that the dispatching rule considering forecast is not always beneficial that is the flood forecast cannot always bring benefits due to the forecast uncertainty for qinghe reservoir when flwl is at 129 5 m the flood risk is smaller with the dispatching rule considering the forecast when no rain or light rain is forecasted when moderate rainfall is forecasted the flood risk is smaller with the conventual dispatching method for chaihe reservoir the flood risk of the dispatching rule considering the forecast for moderate rainfall and the conventual dispatching rule for light rainfall is smaller this result guides the utilization of flood forecasts and the selection of the flood control operation rule 4 3 flood risk transmission between reservoirs according to the above analysis when moderate or light rainfall is forecasted the flood risk of all the points along the upper bound flwl relationship in fig 6 is smaller than the designed risk that is the flood control capacity reserved for the safety of downstream and reservoir is adequate however though the system is safe the flood risk between the reservoirs is different for different storage allocation scenarios i e different points in the region of fig 6 more storage in one reservoir means less storage in the other one and more storage brings a higher flood risk that is different flood control storage allocation schemes indicate flood risk transmission between reservoirs based on the flwl upper bound curve 41 scenarios of flwls are obtained by increasing the flwl of chaihe reservoir by 0 1 m from 104 m to 108 m the flood risks of 41 scenarios under different characteristic water levels are shown in figs 9 and 10 as shown in the figure the flood risk in qinghe reservoir nonlinearly decreases with that of chaihe reservoir i e different flood control storage allocation scenarios lead to a nonlinear transmission relationship of flood risks in the parallel reservoirs for the light rainfall forecast scenario when flwl locates in region a in fig 10 a i e the flwl ranges in 129 5 128 3 m for qinghe reservoir and 104 0 106 2 m for chaihe reservoir a slight increase in the flood risk of chaihe reservoir can greatly decrease the flood risk of qinghe reservoir while when flwl locates in region b that flwl ranges in 127 4 127 0 m for qinghe reservoir and 107 4 108 m for chaihe reservoir a slight decrease in the flood risk of qinghe reservoir induces a great increase of flood risk in chaihe reservoir in addition as shown in fig 9 especially in fig 9 a the flood risk transmission curve is discontinuous which is caused by the mutations in the variation curve of flood risk with flwl in fig 10 as shown in fig 10 a that the flood risk in qinghe reservoir dramatically increases with flwl changing from 127 4 m to 127 5 m and the flood risk in chaihe reservoir dramatically increases with flwl changing from 106 6 m to 106 7 m and instead dramatically decreases from 107 9 m to 108 m the reason for the dramatically increasing flood risk is due to the peak staggering regulation of the reservoir for example when flwl in chaihe reservoir is 106 7 m the 3rd discharge operation of no discharge for chaihe reservoir shown in appendix d is triggered while it is not triggered when flwl is 106 6 m thus the maximum reservoir water level is much higher when flwl is 106 7 m the reason for dramatically decrease is that a greater discharge operation is triggered for example when flwl in chaihe reservoir is 108 m the maximum reservoir water level is higher than 111 8 m when encountering a flood with a rainfall omission probability of 0 001 and relative runoff forecast error of 0 6 for a light rainfall forecast and thus the 5th discharge operation is triggered and then the discharge is higher than the inflow shown in fig 11 therefore the maximum reservoir water level instead decreases it is worth mentioning that the flood risk transmission between reservoirs under different flood control standards is similar with the same flwl ranges in each region as shown by the different curves in fig 9 and different sub figures in fig 10 in conclusion based on the quantitative flood risk transmission relationship between the parallel reservoirs the satisfied flwls can be determined according to the decision maker s preference the following suggestions and guidelines for the dynamic control of flwl are put forward based on the marginal utility principle when light or moderate rainfall is forecasted a when light rainfall is forecasted if more emphasis is on flood control safety in chaihe reservoir the flwl for chaihe should be lower than 106 2 m and qinghe higher than 128 3 m if decision makers are more concerned about the flood control safety in qinghe reservoir the flwl for qinghe should be lower than 127 4 m and chaihe higher than 107 4 m if to balance the flood risk in the two reservoirs the flwl should be in the range of 127 4 128 3 m and 106 2 107 4 m in qinghe reservoir and chaihe reservoir respectively b when moderate rainfall is forecasted if more emphasis is on flood control safety in chaihe reservoir the flwl for chaihe should be lower than 105 7 m and qinghe higher than 128 6 m if decision makers are more concerned about the flood control safety in qinghe reservoir the flwl for qinghe should be lower than 128 0 m and chaihe higher than 106 6 m if to balance the flood risk in the two reservoirs the flwl should be in the range of 105 8 106 5 m and 128 1 128 5 m in chaihe reservoir and qinghe reservoir respectively similar suggestions can be drawn for no rainfall forecasts 4 4 flood risk propagation from upstream to downstream the flood risk propagates from upstream to downstream through reservoir discharge under different storage capacity allocation schemes the safety streamflow rate downstream i e represented by the shifosi hydrology station with a recurrence interval of 20 years is 5 500 m3 s which is used as the standard for dc flwl the corresponding safety discharge from the reservoir is 2 766 m3 s which is the most unfavorable situation the discharge from the parallel reservoir accounts for the minimum the flood risk rate downstream under different storage capacity allocation schemes is demonstrated in fig 12 as displayed in the figure the flood risk downstream shows a trend of first increasing and then decreasing with the decrease of flood control storage of any reservoir that is with the increase of flwl of any reservoir meanwhile the flood risk propagation relationship from upstream to downstream is nonlinear and the variation with flwl can be divided into three regions shown as a b and c regions in fig 12 the downstream flood risk in regions a and c varies greatly with the flwl of the reservoir while that in region b is gentle with the nonlinear quantitative propagation relationship of flood risk the satisfied flwl can be determined according to the decision maker s preference here we draw the following conclusions and implications with the marginal utility principle when moderate rainfall or light rainfall is forecasted the downstream flood risk is relatively high when the flood control storage between the two reservoirs is evenly allocated and conversely the flood risk is low when moderate rainfall is forecasted to guarantee a low risk downstream the flwl of chaihe reservoir should be within the range of 104 0 105 7 m or 106 6 108 0 m and that of qinghe reservoir is 127 0 127 9 m or 128 6 129 5 m when light rainfall is forecasted the range of flwl for chaihe reservoir is 104 0 104 6 m or 107 4 108 0 m and that of qinghe reservoir is 129 2 129 5 m or 127 0 127 4 m 5 conclusions this paper concentrated on the flood water utilization of the parallel reservoirs based on the concept of dynamic control of flwl dc flwl and analyzed the flood risk caused by forecast uncertainties the flwl optimal control framework consisting of the flwl upper bound derivation module the flood risk analysis module and the optimal flwl decision making module is developed firstly the upper bound relationship of the parallel reservoirs is derived by coupling the capacity constrained pre release method and the aggregation decomposition method considering rainfall forecasts then the flood risks of the reservoir and downstream caused by forecast uncertainties are calculated with the total probability formula third the transmission and propagation of flood risk in the system are elaborated and based on this the optimal flwls under different decision making preferences are recommended the qinghe and chaihe parallel reservoir system located in northeast china is taken as a case study results show that there exists a nonlinear relationship between the upper bounds of flwl in the two reservoirs when considering 24 hour rainfall forecasts the maximum flwl of the qinghe and chaihe reservoirs can be raised to 129 5 m from 127 m and 108 m from 104 m respectively and the flood risks at the upper bound of flwl are all lower than that of the designed flwl the results indicate that on the one hand the joint operation of the parallel reservoir and the utilization of 24 hour rainfall forecasts can both improve the water conservation benefits and the flood control benefits on the other hand it is safe to control the flwl in the domain surrounded by the upper bound flwl curve when the 24 hour rainfall forecast is not higher than the moderate grade moreover the flood risk nonlinearly transfers between the reservoirs and nonlinearly propagates from the upstream to the downstream with the nonlinear transmission and propagation relationship of flood risk the satisfied flwls can be determined according to the decision maker s preference for example to guarantee a low risk downstream the flwl of chaihe reservoir should be within the range of 104 105 7 m or 106 6 108 m and that of qinghe reservoir is 127 127 9 m or 128 6 129 5 m when moderate rainfall is forecasted the framework proposed in this paper is appropriate for parallel reservoirs and can be extended to parallel systems in the real world the system often consists of both parallel reservoirs and cascaded reservoirs there exists a higher potential for flood water utilization but the flood risk transmission and propagation in the system are more complicated further research is required to extend the framework to a more complex reservoir system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

u2240204 52079015 appendix a performance of the rainfall runoff hydrological model the xin anjiang rainfall runoff model xaj model developed by zhao 1992 is used in this study for flood forecasting a total of 22 historical floods from 1964 to 2013 are used for the model construction of qinghe reservoir among which 17 floods from 1964 to 2008 are used for calibration and the remaining 5 floods are used for validation in chaihe reservoir 20 floods from 1973 to 2013 in chaihe basin are applied in the model among them 16 floods that occurred before 2006 are used for parameter calibration and 4 floods that occurred between 2007 and 2013 are used for validation tables a1 and a2 list the optimized parameters of the xaj model for qinghe and chaihe reservoirs respectively and figs a1 and a2 show the results of the calibration and verification period in the figures the dotted lines represent the acceptable relative errors of 20 as shown in figs a1 and a2 only one relative peak flow error and one relative runoff error exceed the acceptable 20 in the verification and calibration period respectively and the runoff error of one calibrated flood is slightly 20 therefore the models are good in flood simulations and can be used for flood forecasting of qinghe and chaihe reservoirs appendix b rainfall forecast uncertainty the 24 hour controlled value of the ensemble rainfall forecast product of ecmwf from may oct during 2007 2017 is used to guide flood water utilization 1 rainfall classification according to the meteorological departments rainfall is classified into 5 grades as shown in table b1 2 rainfall forecast precision indicators to explore the accuracy of rainfall forecast within each grade accuracy rate missing rate and vacancy rate shown in the following equations are selected b 1 ts n a n a n b n c b 2 far n b n a n b n c b 3 po n c n a n b n c where ts far and po are the accuracy rate missing rate and vacancy rate respectively n a is the number of actual rainfall falling into the same grade as the rainfall forecast n b donates the number of the actual rainfall falling into a greater grade than the rainfall forecast and n c is the number of times that is smaller 3 rainfall forecast uncertainty the distribution of actual rainfall under different forecast rainfall grades for qinghe and chaihe is fitted with the p iii distribution part of which is shown in fig b1 then the possible rainfall at different probabilities can be obtained shown in table b2 appendix c runoff forecast uncertainty based on the runoff forecast results the maximum entropy model is applied to determine the probability distribution of relative forecast error with an error threshold of μ 5 σ μ 5 σ shown in fig c1 μ denotes the mean value of relative forecast error and it is 0 0097 and 0 026 for qinghe and chaihe respectively σ represents the standard deviation and it is 0 136 and 0 015 for qinghe and chaihe respectively the error threshold is 0 65 0 59 and 0 67 0 69 for qinghe and chaihe reservoirs respectively the probability i e the prior probability of forecast error is listed in table c1 appendix d conventional dispatching rule and operation rule considering forecasts 1 conventional dispatching rule the conventional dispatching rule takes the water level as the control index listed in tables d1 and d2 2 dispatching rule considering forecasts the cumulative net rainfall is taken as the primary discriminative index and the water level is the second one the operating rules of qinghe reservoir and chaihe reservoir are listed in tables d3 and d4
