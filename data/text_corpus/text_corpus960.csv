4800,climate change cc along with land use and land cover change lulcc have a strong influence in water availability in already fragile mediterranean ecosystems in this work the soil and water assessment tool swat was implemented for the 2006 2018 period in a rainfed catchment of central chile 36 to test the hypothesis that adaptive plantation strategies could mitigate the impacts of climate change and increase streamflow we also hypothesize that afforestation with exotic tree plantations will reduce water availability in mediterranean catchments acting in synergy with climate change five lulcc scenarios are analyzed i current long term national forest policy fp ii extreme scenario ex with large afforestation surfaces both including the replacement of native shrublands with pinus radiata iii adaptive plantation management scenario fm with lower planting density iv forced land displacement scenario fld where plantations at the headwaters are moved to lowland areas and replaced with native shrublands and v pristine scenario pr with only native vegetation each lulcc scenario was run with present climate and with projections of different cmip5 climate models under the rcp 8 5 scenario for the period 2037 2050 and then compared against simulations based on the present land cover and climate simulations with the five lulcc scenarios fp ex fm fld and pr with present climate resulted in variations of 2 5 17 3 0 2 3 and 10 9 on mean annual streamflow q while simulations with the current land cover and cc projections produced a 32 1 decrease in mean annual q the joint impact of cc and lulcc leads to changes in mean annual q ranging from 46 2 ex to 23 3 pr afforestation with exotic pines will intensify the reduction in water yield while conservative scenarios focused on native forests protection and restoration could partially mitigate the effect of cc we make a strong call to rethink current and future land management strategies to cope with lower water availability in a drier future keywords lulcc exotic plantations native shrubland swat hydrological response sdgs 1 introduction societies already affected by water scarcity are struggling to devise effective ways to mitigate the negative impacts of global change on water availability both for human beings and ecosystems rossing 2010 mediterranean regions are particularly prone to droughts given observed and projected reduction of precipitation due to climate change cc polade et al 2017 rojas et al 2019 central chile 30 39 s has undergone a negative precipitation trend of approximately 4 per decade between 1960 and 2016 boisier et al 2018 accompanied by an increase in air temperature of about 0 18 c decade for the central depression for the 1979 2006 period falvey and garreaud 2009 the current decade is the warmest of the last 100 years and during the last nine years the so called chilean megadrought stands out as the longest and most extended dry period on record causing higher evaporation rates in water bodies larger evapotranspiration et from crops and natural vegetation and an accelerated melting of snow the hydrological response of catchments has also been affected causing an important reduction in streamflow q and shortages on drinking water for rural communities alvarez garreton et al 2018 garreaud et al 2017 a more severe effect is expected in the near future with projected reductions in precipitation of up to 30 leading to runoff reductions of about 40 under rcp8 5 bozkurt et al 2018 valdés pineda et al 2014 land use and land cover change lulcc is the other main driver of global change with important impacts at global and local scale one of the most important changes in land use is afforestation with commercial exotic tree plantations which increased from 167 5 to 277 9 million hectares worldwide between 1990 and 2015 temperate zones such as mediterranean regions represent 56 of this area payn et al 2015 south america is currently experiencing the rapid expansion of exotic species of commercial tree plantations jones et al 2016 in particular chile stands out as the fifth largest producer of roundwood in the world on the basis of fast growing monoculture plantations of pinus radiata and eucalyptus spp with short rotations of 18 and 10 12 years respectively jürgensen et al 2014 this timber industry is the second largest commercial export sector in chile after mining salas et al 2016 and it was consolidated in mid 1970 s with the implementation of state subsidies to encourage private sector participation in the expansion of forest plantations as a basis for the development of the private forest industry and exportations lara veblen 1993 thus planted area grew from 375 000 to 1 7 million hectares between 1970 and 1994 niklitschek 2007 and to 2 3 million hectares in 2015 infor 2015 concentrated mainly in the area located between 34 and 41 s specifically in the coastal mountain range armesto et al 2010 this area is intended to increase under the current 2015 2035 chilean forest policy to contribute to the country s economic and social development minagri 2015 absorption and sequestration of co2 by forests also play a significant role in chile s commitment to carbon neutrality by 2050 and is part of the country s nationally determined contributions ndc to fullfil international climate commitments defined in the ratification of the paris agreement government of chile 2020 worldwide several studies support the hypothesis of a strong negative impact of forest plantations on water yield when they replace other covers e g grasslands shrublands since they modify transpiration interception and evaporation processes within a catchment calder 2007 farley et al 2005 garmendia et al 2012 zhang et al 2011 2017 in chile some studies highlight this evidence at different scales in experimental plots and small scale catchments forest plantations have been associated with higher consumption of soil water compared to grasslands producing high et rates and low percolation huber et al 2008 p radiata plantations have been related to the high interception of canopy precipitation while actual et is fed exclusively by edaphic water during summer huber et al 2010 consistent results were obtained using satellite observations through an energy balance model over a landscape of south central chile where forest plantations showed higher et rates during spring olivera guerra et al 2014 in addition lara et al 2009 reported a negative correlation between annual and summer runoff and the forest plantation area in small coastal catchments of southern chile c 40 s while a positive correlation was found between runoff and the area of native forest cover during the dry season at a larger scale a decrease in summer runoff was reported in response to the increase in the area of p radiata plantations at the expense of native forest in the period 1975 2000 in two catchments of south central chile 252 and 650 km2 little et al 2009 in southern catchments of similar size decreasing flows during summer were found when afforestation was introduced using a statistical model iroumé palacios 2013 recently a study comprising 25 large forested catchments in south central chile showed a general decrease in q when shrublands pastures or native forest are replaced by exotic forest plantations using a statistical regression between precipitation and spatially distributed land cover data alvarez garreton et al 2019 on the other hand there is a wide range of studies that analyze changes in the hydrological cycle due to changes in land cover and or climate garmendia et al 2012 lu et al 2015 molina navarro et al 2016 stehr et al 2010 which have provided useful insights for water resources management gassman et al 2014 however only few studies serpa et al 2015 carvalho santos et al 2016 proposed to disentangle the joint effect of cc and lullc especially on the hydrological regime of mediterranean forested catchments process based hydrological models are some of the tools commonly used to evaluate changes in individual components of the hydrological cycle devia et al 2015 the soil and water assessment tool swat model was developed to predict the impact of land management practices and their use on water resources in large and complex catchments considering different soil types land use topography and management practices arnold et al 2012 this research aims to provide evidence for policy recommendations on land management strategies required to cope with lower water availability in mediterranean catchments where tree plantation afforestation is under discussion we hypothesize that adaptive plantation strategies could mitigate the impacts of climate change and increase streamflows additionally we hypothesize that afforestation with exotic tree plantations will reduce water availability in the mediterranean catchments acting in synergy with climate change to test these hypotheses we selected the cauquenes catchment 620 km2 located in the mediterranean south central chile as a case study this catchment was selected because large areas of native vegetation have been replaced by exotic tree plantations in the last decades and the current chilean forest policy threatens to exacerbate this trend in addition this catchment is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to high poverty pino et al 2015 and the presence of native ecosystems in danger of extinction alaniz et al 2016 hence decision on future land use change should consider addressing several objectives at the same time as is the call under the un 2030 agenda of the sustainable development goals sdgs 2 methodology the general framework of the methodology is displayed in fig 1 where we can distinguished four main themes i the swat implementation center with a general description of the hydrological modelling procedure e g calibration method ii the cc and lulcc scenarios upper and lower part of the figure iii analysis of swat simulations of spatio temporal patterns of three hydrological components to the left considering the hydrological response units hrus behavior during dry and normal years under present and cc periods iv analysis of the relative differences of qs between the present condition and the five lulcc the 24 cc models and the joint effect of lulcc and cc scenarios to the right 2 1 study area the study area corresponds to the headwaters of the cauquenes river catchment 620 km2 a tributary of the maule river located on the eastern slope of the coastal mountain range in south central chile fig 2 this catchment has a warm summer mediterranean climate csb in the köppen geiger classification and it is water limited according to budyko s dryness index mcvicar et al 2012 the annual precipitation is 814 mm concentrated from april to september with strong inter annual variability while the annual average temperature is 14 7 c according to a historical weather station located downstream with records since 1976 the catchment has no nival contribution so its hydrological regime is strictly rainfed with the highest flows during winter jja and the lowest water levels during summer djf in july streamflows reach values above 20 m3 s 1 50 of the time while during summer 100 of the time streamflows are below 2 m3 s 1 elevation ranges from 150 to 750 m a s l with an average of 317 m a s l and an average slope of 17 fig 2a the catchment provides ideal conditions to study the effect of land use on different components of the hydrological cycle for two main reasons i irrigation can be neglected since the anthropogenic activities are mainly rainfed crops or forest plantations ii it has little hydraulic infrastructure such as irrigation channels and reservoirs and iii it has a mosaic of land use classes with different water consumption rates which can be used for evaluating lulcc impacts on q it is important to note that the downstream area of the cauquenes river is of utmost importance for human activities such as agriculture recreational purposes and drinking water for rural and urban areas 2 2 the swat model the soil and water assessment tool swat is a process based catchment scale semi distributed hydrological model in swat each sub catchment is divided into hydrological response units hrus which consists of homogeneous areas in terms of soil type land cover slope and water management practices neitsch et al 2011 in this work hrus representative of the two main land cover types native shrublands and exotic forest plantations are used to study the evolution of individual components of the hydrological cycle precipitation actual evapotranspiration and water yield surface runoff is estimated with the modified scs curve number method while potential et was computed with the hargreaves equation both chosen based on input data availability the variable storage method was selected to route water through the drainage network for further details of the equations used to represent hydrological processes see the theoretical documentation of the model in neitsch et al 2011 the qswat software was used as an interface dile et al 2016 to prepare the input data used to run swat 2012 rev637 2 3 input data 2 3 1 topography and catchment delineation we used the 12 5 m tandem x digital elevation model of the german aerospace center and eads astrium to define the subcatchments we used the strahler method with a threshold of 12 5 km2 to define the minimum drainage area resulting in 26 subcatchments hrus are obtained considering slope bands of 10 20 30 and 30 and a minimum size of 2 5 of the corresponding subcatchments resulting in 233 hrus 2 3 2 land use land cover data land cover was generated using a supervised classification based on landsat oli satellite data for february 2016 following the methodology of chuvieco 2008 the overall accuracy oa was 86 5 and the kappa coefficient was 0 81 considered almost perfect landis koch 1977 the largest uncertainty corresponded to agriculture and pasturelands with baren areas which were confused by the classifier with shrublands a 7x7 filter and a 3x3 grouping were applied reallocating isolated and anomalous pixels to achieve a sharper spatial distribution of the categories then the classified land covers were assigned to existing vegetation categories in swat according to table 1 the area covered by the different land use land cover classes are forest plantations 43 shrublands 43 barren areas including clearcuts 10 native forests 3 urban areas town of quirihue 0 5 located in the southern portion of the catchment and agriculture and pasturelands 0 4 fig 3 2 3 3 soil data soils of cauquenes are classified as lithosols i lc c ciren 1997 and soil data was available as orthophotos at a 1 20 000 scale in addition we introduced physical properties measured in situ from the database of soto et al 2019 details of the data in supplementary material i following chen et al 2016 soil depth was fixed to 2 m for all land uses based on the average depth of the catchment according to global gridded soil information hengl et al 2017 but p radiata plantations and native forest were fixed to 3 m according to their capabilities to extract water from deeper horizons sand nambiar 1984 teskey sheriff 1996 huber et al 2010 2 3 4 climate data daily precipitation p and air temperature were obtained from three rain gauges three weather stations from public institutions for the 2006 2018 period and three rain gauges located in high elevation for the 2018 2019 period fig 2 and supplementary material ii for each subcatchment swat uses the closest climate and rain gauge station quality assessment of p data was performed using a double mass curve analysis gap filling was done using regressions with the nearest station less than 3 of missing data for temperature an exploratory analysis was used to verify anomalous data while gap filling was performed with linear regression with the nearest station on average less than 10 of missing data three virtual rain gauges were included to represent topographic effect as previously reported for chilean coastal range garreaud et al 2016 the daily 5 km resolution cr2met precipitation dataset http www cr2 cl datos productos grillados was used to provide three virtual rain gauges to represent high elevation rainfall this product was verified according to a point to pixel analysis against three rain gauge stations hobo rain gauge rg3 5 installed during the 2018 2019 period supplementary material ii satisfactory results were obtained with correlations ranging from 0 6 to 0 68 at daily scale and 0 93 to 0 98 at monthly scale 2 3 5 river discharge data daily observations were obtained from the río cauquenes en el arrayán discharge station supplementary material ii gap filling was not performed it has 95 data in the period in addition possible anthropogenic modifications to the measurements and data consistency were verified through the method of double mass curves with two streamflow stations río cauquenes en desembocadura 35 54 s 72 03 o and río purapel en sauzal 35 45 s 72 04 w 2 4 model implementation thirteen years of simulation period was chosen 2006 2018 for flow evaluation when land use changes are modified this period represents a compromise between a sufficient extensive time series of streamflow data and the stable landscape of the catchment represented by the current land cover reference scenario the model was run at the daily time step using 2006 2007 and 2008 2014 as warming up and calibration periods respectively the verification period considered years 2015 to 2018 2 4 1 parameter identification to reduce the number of parameters to be calibrated a sensitivity analysis was carried out for 15 parameters selected based on literature review the sensitivity analysis was carried out using a variance based global sensibility analysis technique sobol sobol 2001 saltelli et al 2010 this method provides an efficient and effective way to assess parameter sensitivity across a full range of parameter values model parameters were selected to represent the following hydrological processes runoff cn2 ch n 1 surlag and ov n groundwater gw delay rchrg dp gwqmn alpha bf revapmn and gw revap evapotranspiration epco and esco and water routing ch n 2 ch k 2 alpha bnk physical ranges used for the sensitivity analysis were obtained from the swat manual arnold et al 2012 neitsch et al 2011 with the exception of surlag gw delay and revapmn which ranges were obtained from brown et al 2015 heathman et al 2009 stehr et al 2010 van liew et al 2007 the meaning of the parameters is explained in the supplementary material iii 2 4 2 vegetation parameters the management and phenological cycle of forests plantations frse and shrublands shrb were represented with parameters obtained from the literature for similar local conditions obtained as described in table 2 2 4 3 calibration and verification calibration process was carried out with the default configuration of hydropso global optimization algorithm zambrano bigiarini rojas 2013 using the nash sutcliffe goodness of fit index nse as objective function the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the percentage of bias pbias and the ratio between the mean square error and the standard deviation of the data rsr were used as goodness of fit measures for calibration and verification in general monthly simulations are considered satisfactory when they satisfy nse 0 50 rsr 0 70 and pbias 25 moriasi et al 2007 2 5 global change scenarios 2 5 1 land use change scenarios six lulcc scenarios are analyzed fig 3 and table 3 the current land cover clc two describing an increase in forest plantation area fp ex one emulating a forest plantation management strategy fm and two conservative scenarios fld pr the effect of these scenarios on q are analyzed for present and future cc periods these scenarios represent the whole range of possible land cover modifications in the catchment and are described in the following paragraphs forest policy scenario fp this scenario represents one of the goals of the strategic axis productivity and economic growth of chilean government where afforestation of half a million of hectares preferably in forestry land belonging to small and medium size owners has to be done by 2035 without replacing native forest minagri 2015 low quality soils available to establish forest plantations were identified based on the soil aptitude map of ciren 1997 the small and medium sized owners 200 ha or less were identified with the cadastral map of rural properties ciren 2001 the current land cover map 2016 was used to identify all the areas covered by shrublands which were selected as the non native forest land cover to be transformed into exotic forest plantations keeping all other coverage constant finally a unique map was generated that integrates the previous criteria of land use modification through map algebra performed in qgis 2 6 9 8 of the current shrubland land cover that fulfill the three criteria described before were converted to p radiata plantations extreme scenario ex this scenario represents the replacement of all the existing native shrublands with exotic forest plantations we decided to include this extreme scenario given the current discussion about chile s strategies to fulfill the ndc s commitments government of chile 2020 with massive afforestation being discussed as a possibility although this scenario seems extreme a similar transformation already occurred in the past when the national forest policy afforestation subsidies and the expansion of the forest industry increased the surface planted with exotic trees in the region exponentially echeverria et al 2006 in addition shrubland ecosystems do not have a protection law that can avoid their conversion into forest plantations alaniz et al 2016 the total area of shrubland 42 7 of the catchment was converted to plantation present land use with forest management fm this scenario represents a cc adaptation strategy where forestry companies use a less intensive forest stand management to address current and projected water scarcity to emulate this situation we maintained the current land cover area but with lower density of tree plantations reducing the maximum leaf area index lai in the swat model we proposed a laimax 3 1 instead of 3 7 calculated by subtracting 60 of the standard deviation of lai measurements obtained from 13p radiata plots under similar site conditions described in álvarez et al 2012 forced land displacement fld this cc adaptation strategy is analyzed to protect water yield as a key ecosystem service in this scenario exotic plantations are moved from headwaters into lower land areas as an ecological strategy leaving their original area to be replaced by native shrublands this scenario considered natural regeneration of vegetation and is likely probable that shrublands will be established in the 2037 2050 period because future cc conditions would limit the development of actual native forest in terms of structure and composition due to its low rate of growth the increase of stressors like droughts change of seasonal phenology and insect herbivory xie et al 2015 yu et al 2016 estay et al 2019 huang et al 2020 the scenario considered natural regeneration of vegetation and according to ecological conditions is likely to similar scenarios have been proposed by other studies to quantify the effect of a technocratic like political decision into the provision of an ecosystem service manuschevich et al 2019 2800 ha of p radiata were displaced to lowlands and were replaced by shrublands from the lowland area pristine native vegetation pr this scenario replaces all the current exotic forest plantations with native forest and shrublands as part of a massive ecological restoration strategy to protect local endangered biodiversity it is created using the potential native vegetation belt proposed by luebert and pliscoff 2018 as the maximum area to represent the potential area cover by native forest and shrubland three vegetation belts are described for the catchment the deciduous forest of nothofagus glauca the sclerophyll forest of lithraea caustica and peumus boldus and the thorny forest of acacia caven and l caustica where the last two belts are defined as shrubland forest plantations were replaced by native forest and shrublands reaching a total of 26 8 and 61 4 of the total catchment area respectively 2 5 2 climate change scenarios a dataset of 26 global circulation models gcm from the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 was used to evaluate the effect of future climate change the simulations correspond to future projections following the representative concentration pathway 8 5 rcp8 5 high emissions scenario we decided to use this pessimistic scenario because it seems to be the business as usual and it represents a useful tool for quantifying physical climate risk especially over near to midterm policy relevant time horizon schwalm et al 2020 precipitation was first biased corrected and interpolated to a 25x25km grid using the methodology implemented in bozkurt et al 2018 monthly rainfall and the average temperature of the 26 gcms were compared against data from the three weather stations during the period 2006 2018 with respect to the annual cycle and interannual variability the results of the comparison indicated a good representation of the monthly climatology for all the models supplementary material iv except for miroc5 and fgoals g2 which were discarded of the subsequent analysis projected climate data were obtained using the delta method quilbé et al 2008 where future minimum and maximum temperatures are constructed by adding to the present day station data the δ t difference from the 24 gcms between the periods 2006 2018 and 2037 2050 see supplementary material v in the case of precipitation future precipitation is obtained by multiplying present day precipitation by the rp change between the two time periods the assumptions behind the delta method include that the effect of climate change is temporarily homogeneous during each month and the occurrence of rainfall remains the same as local data δ t s m 2037 2050 t cc s m y 13 2006 2018 t cc s m y 13 rp s m y 2037 2050 p cc s m y 13 y 2006 2018 p cc s

change 2 6 evaluation of the impact of global change on water yield to reduce the number of hydrological simulations only three future climate change scenarios were created for each lulcc scenario dry and hot climate change cc dh climate change multi model median cc mm and wetter and warmer climate change cc ww representing the first second median and third quartiles respectively of the p and t factors δ t r p of the selected 24 cc models cc dh was constructed by adding to the baseline climate for each month the mean delta of the 8 models that simulated the largest change in precipitation and temperature hence the driest and hottest case the cc mm was constructed by adding the multi model median for both variables and the cc ww by adding the 8 models with the least changes for each month i e the least warming and drying and even a small increase in precipitation these three scenarios are used as a sort of multi model low median and high climate scenarios mishra et al 2018 see supplementary material v for exact values the relative differences of q between the present condition 2006 2018 and different scenarios of global change were analyzed with the following equation r e l a t i v e d i f f e r e n c e s q scenario s q present s q present s 100 where q scenario s are streamflows simulated for scenarios lulcc and cc and q present s are streamflows simulated during the present period 2006 2020 relative percentage differences were calculated for the five lulcc scenarios the 24 cc models the cc dh cc mm and cc ww scenarios and the joint effect of lulcc and cc scenarios fig 1 2 7 spatio temporal analysis of hrus hydrological components a detailed evaluation of the changes in actual evapotranspiration eta available soil water content aswc and water yield wy was carried out for the 206 hrus representing forest plantations 98 and shrublands 108 considering the hydrological year april to march both cases were analyzed through monthly boxplots for a dry and a normal year during the megadrought the 2016 was the driest year of the simulation period during the megadrought period 2010 2018 when annual recorded p was 464 mm and mean q of in the cauquenes river was 1 5 m3 s 1 in the absence of wet years during the simulation period the 2015 year was considered as normal despite being placed within the megadrought as its annual p was 790 mm and mean annual q of 8 1 m3 s 1 which were like the average hydrometeorological conditions 886 mm of p and 8 9 m3 s 1of q for the 1976 2009 period to compute the hydrological components of hrus during the cc period only the cc mm scenario was chosen in addition the spatial distribution of the hydrological components during these periods were also analyzed for shrubland and forest plantation hrus by calculation of annual means during the dry and normal years 3 results 3 1 calibration and verification we calibrated 11 parameters based on results of the sobol sensitivity analysis the most sensitive parameter was the curve number cn corresponding to tree plantations and shrublands where the calibration range was set to 63 77 and 71 86 and the final calibrated values were 82 and 77 respectively the water routing parameter ch k was also sensitive the best parameter values obtained with the hydropso algorithm are summarized in supplementary material iii in general simulated q were able to represent observed flows except during highest winter events when model simulations underestimate peaks greater than 80 m3 s 1 at a daily scale fig 4 a and fig 4b daily and monthly model efficiencies during calibration and validation period were similar nash sutcliffe efficiencies obtained during calibration and verification were 0 75 and 0 72 at daily time scale and 0 88 and 0 88 at monthly scale respectively while the pbias and rsr were below 12 6 and 0 53 respectively for daily and monthly time scales table 4 therefore we consider our results as an acceptable representation of the hydrological processes occurring within our study area in particular a monthly time scale was considered for the further scenario analysis since it was classified as very good in the calibration and verification period in terms of nse and pbias moriasi et al 2007 3 2 climate change projections factors obtained through the delta method show an increase of tmax and tmin for all months and all models as well as a decrease of precipitation for most months and models although some models and for some months project an increase in p fig 5 and supplementary material v the construction of the three cc projections used to force the swat model show an average increase of 0 95 c cc mm for the period 2037 2050 with respect to 2006 2018 the cc dh and cc ww projections are on average 1 1 c and 0 85 c warmer respectively all three simulations cc mm cc dw and cc ww show largest warming in summer djf 1 06 c 1 25 and 0 89 c respectively and smallest warming in winter jja 0 81 c 0 92 c and 0 51 c respectively tmin are also projected to increase during all months and all models but in a smaller amount in the annual mean the cc mm cc dh and cc ww simulations increase 0 79 c 0 94 c and 0 62 c respectively again smallest increases are found for winter 0 61 c 0 72 c and 0 47 c respectively and largest for summer or autumn for precipitation in the cc mm scenario the average monthly delta factor is of 0 91 which represents a decrease in p in the order of 9 the largest decreases are projected for summer djf 14 and smallest in autumn of only 1 only six models showed delta values larger than 1 for p depicting an increment in the annual mean e g csiro mk3 6 0 with an average delta of 1 6 however most of the models i e 18 showed delta values lower than 1 for p with the lowest value of 0 66 for the ipsl cm5a lr the scenarios cc dh and cc ww correspond to annual mean p changes of 19 decrease and 4 increase respectively note that although the cc ww corresponds to a scenario with an overall increase of p summer and spring do not show a change and autumn and winter show a 4 and 5 increase with respect to 2006 2018 respectively 3 3 flow impact assessment for the current climate period 2006 2018 fig 6 a and supplementary material vi show the relative differences of mean annual q between present land cover and the lulcc scenarios a decrease of 2 5 and 17 3 of mean annual q is observed for the fp and ex scenarios and the decrease is accentuated in june with a median decrease of 4 5 and 31 8 respectively practically no changes in q were detected for the fm adaptive management scenario the fld scenario showed a general increase in flow with a mean annual increase of 2 3 and mean monthly values ranging from 0 1 in september to 4 1 in april the largest increase was observed for the pr scenario with a 10 9 increase in mean annual q with positive values in all months the lowest increase in april 3 9 and highest increase in december 15 2 hydrological simulations driven by the 24 climate change models and by the three future climate change scenarios cc dh cc mm cc ww with the current land cover are displayed in the clc cc scenario of fig 6b and fig 7 respectively a general reduction of q is observed when analyzing the 24 cc models individually according to monthly median reductions ranging from 17 1 in march to 57 4 in may however large spread in q simulations is also observed according to the size of the monthly boxplots which ranges up to 100 in july depicting positive values of relative difference in q for all months in cc mm a general decrease of 32 is found for q with largest decreases simulated for autumn mam of about 35 and lowest in summer djf of 27 in cc dh a sharp decrease of 61 5 is found with largest decreases simulated for winter jja of about 63 and lowest in summer of 58 in cc ww an increase of 9 is found with largest increases simulated for winter jja of about 20 and decreases in spring of 1 the combined effects of lulcc and cc scenarios on q are displayed in fig 7 when calculating streamflow differences with the cc mm q decreases regardless of the land use scenario used effects are largest for the ex simulation with a decrease of 46 6 followed by the fp and current land cover scenario clc with decrease of 34 and 32 respectively adaptive management scenarios showed q decreases of 31 7 29 5 and 22 3 for fm fld and pr scenarios respectively supplementary material vi when analyzing the effect of lulcc under cc dh scenario on q a similar hierarchy of q decrease was found with a sharp decrease for ex fp and clc with values of 72 63 and 62 respectively adaptive scenarios showed a lower decrease on q with values of 62 60 and 56 for the fm fld and pr scenarios respectively the cc ww scenario depicted a decrease on q only for ex with a value of 8 increases on q were found for the rest of lulcc scenarios with values of 9 7 9 12 and 24 for clc fp fm fld and pr respectively increases on flow are consequent with the projected precipitations which on average increases about 8 with respect to the p over the 2006 2018 period seasonal trends of q are similar than annual trends however summer q showed lower decreases than the rest of the seasons for the cc mm and the cc dh scenarios this is especially visible for pr with decreases on q of 50 to 14 for cc dh and cc mm winters q also followed a different trend for the cc ww scenario with larger increases for the clc fp fm and fld with respect to other seasons fig 7 3 4 3 4 impacts on hydrological processes fig 8 shows boxplots with the monthly values

and dry year both under present p and projected climate conditions cc for the normal year under the present climate conditions eta fig 8a showed a marked seasonal dynamic especially for p radiata frse with an increasing trend from august to december where the maximum values are reached then a sharp decrease in eta throughout the summer months djf until reaching the lowest levels in february shrublands shrb showed a lower eta dynamic with similar seasonality throughout the year and the maximum values reached in october they present lower amounts of aswc fig 8c than exotic plantations during winter however a sharp decrease starts in october for exotic plantations and extends until completely deplete it in january while shrublands keep aswc during the whole year regarding water yield wy fig 8e it showed a visible seasonality for the two land covers with high values in winter and practically zero values in summer for both land covers a large spread is also observed in july and august winter with higher variability for shrublands in comparison to the normal year the dry one present a similar seasonality and magnitude of eta and aswc for shrublands which is not the case for p radiata where an important reduction and an earlier decrease are observed fig 8b d total yearly eta was reduced from 709 to 623 mm for exotic plantations extremely low values of wy are observed for both land cover all along the year especially for exotic plantations fig 8f the latter situation agrees with the precipitation 464 mm and streamflow 1 5 m3 s 1 levels of this year 2016 considering the projected cc scenarios in a normal year a similar seasonality and magnitude is observed for eta and aswc for both land covers in comparison to the present climate fig 8a and fig 8c this was not the case for wy where an important decrease is projected under drier future projections a reduction of eta and aswc is estimated for both land covers especially for p radiata where yearly eta diminished from 683 to 518 mm fig 8b c earlier decrease is also estimated with aswc depletion in november finally fig 8e shows a sharp decrease in wy for both land covers in winter jja months where the total yearly wy did not exceed 32 mm for pines the present spatial distribution of hydrological components is displayed in fig 9 for a normal and dry year respectively a clear spatial relation between precipitation and eta is depicted with high values located at the high elevation lands in the western part of the catchment fig 2 this relation was consistent during normal and dry years the eastern part of the catchment where abundant forest plantations are present fig 3 exhibited relatively high values of eta ranging from 605 to 658 mm of eta under normal years fig 9b however this situation changed for the dry year where the same area showed much lower values ranging from 446 to 507 mm of eta fig 9e wy showed a different spatial pattern with high values in normal years located in the high elevation areas of the northwestern and central part of the catchment fig 9 c lower values of wy are observed for the western and southeastern part of the catchment where most of the exotic forest plantations are located fig 9c and fig 3 during the dry year wy a considerable reduction in wy magnitudes was observed e g maximum range fall from 717 mm to 214 mm the western area mainly cover with exotic plantations showed a marked decreased in wy moving from 300 to 400 mm in normal year to 50 100 mm in a dry year fig 9f and fig 3 4 discussion 4 1 impact of lulcc the decrease in q observed with the expansion of exotic forest plantations fp and ex scenarios is in agreement with different reviews and meta analysis documenting that afforestation with non native species have reduced water yield in different regions of the world and that this decrease is enhanced under dry conditions e g farley et al 2005 scott prinsloo 2008 filoso et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 ferraz et al 2019 several studies report the negative effect of the expansion of forest plantations on streamflow in mediterranean areas in an australian catchment with an et pp ratio similar to our study the conversion and replacement of 10 to 50 of the pasture area with plantations generated a decrease in q between 1 and 3 6 nguyen et al 2017 this is like the 2 5 decrease in q reported in our catchment when 10 of the area originally covered with shrublands is replaced by plantations but less than the 17 3 change in q when 43 of its area covered with shrubland is replaced by pines these differences could be explained by the size of the catchments since cauquenes is three times bigger than the one studied by nguyen et al 2017 and this could amplify the q decrease in our study pilgrim et al 1982 gallo et al 2015 in spite of these differences similar results have been reported by carvalho santos et al 2016 in a mediterranean catchment in europe with a decrease of 7 when introducing 63 5 of eucalyptus plantation in the southern portion of the temperate mediterranean region of chile 38 39 s with a mean annual precipitation of 1650 mm and a dry season of five months stehr et al 2010 reported a reduction of 10 6 in q for a scenario of 96 increase in exotic forest plantations for the vergara catchment 133 km2 at the expense of shrublands and agricultural lands their estimate is lower compared to the 17 3 estimated in q for our ex scenario with a 43 increase in forest plantations area higher precipitation and a different soil pedogenesis with deeper volcanic soils in contrast to the lithosols present in cauquenes which are shallower and with a higher bulk density and lower water storage capacity soto et al 2019 may explain differences in the magnitude of streamflow reduction alvarez garreton et al 2019 carried out a regression model in 25 chilean catchments to assess the impact on q from the replacement of several land cover classes with exotic tree plantations their study considered cauquenes catchment as one of the 13 drier catchments aridity indices ranging from 0 17 to 1 5 and they found a 3 decrease in q after a replacement of 6000 ha of shrublands in this catchment these results were like the change obtained for our fp scenario 2 5 in which 5600 ha of shrublands were replaced by p radiata the consistency of the decrease in q obtained by this statistical approach and our process based modelling results reinforce the confidence in the robustness of our analysis another study done at the cauquenes catchment documented forest plantation area increased from 20 to 42 22 from 1990 to 2000 and estimated a 31 9 reduction in summer streamflow for the period 1991 2000 compared to 1981 1990 using a linear model from the changes in runoff q p residuals little et al 2009 their estimate is higher than the 17 3 decrease in q for our ex scenario where forest plantations increased by 43 despite using different methods and reference periods differences between both estimates might be explained by the steep reduction of streamflow during the first rotation of plantations when they were not only expanding but actively growing with similar age classes before the first clear cut conversely the model built in this study estimated the water yield of plantations compared to other land uses for the 2006 2018 period when plantations formed a mosaic of age classes and development stages after two or three 16 18 year rotations that are commonly used for pines in chile this becomes clear since total area of plantations was estimated in 42 for 2000 little et al 2009 which remains stable 43 in 2016 estimated by us indicating this shifting mosaic of age classes that buffers the effect of plantations on reducing streamflow as they age in short rotations farley et al 2005 this indicates that streamflow for the fp and especially for the ex scenario might probably reach a much lower value when all the plantations are in their first rotation in the next 15 20 years i e in 2033 2038 than the one we estimated for the 2037 2050 period adaptive scenarios fm fld pr showed positive to neutral responses highlighting the role of native vegetation and possible restoration strategies the less intense stand plantation management scenario fm in fig 6a represented with a decrease in maximum lai did not produce important changes in q this was a counterintuitive result given the evidence about the importance of this variable in the use of water in tree plantations barrientos iroumé 2018 the sensitivity of this parameter in the swat model seems to be misrepresented under certain forest ecosystems yang and zhang 2016 nonetheless the fld scenario showed an increase 2 3 in q resulting in a partial mitigation of the impact of tree plantations results regarding the strategy proposed in our fld scenario highlights that protection of headwaters with native ecosystem seems to be able to favor infiltration and hence water availability downstream buttle 2011 the pristine pr scenario showed an 11 increase in annual q for a change in native area cover from 2 7 in 2018 to 26 8 24 1 increase this increase is like the 14 1 rise in summer streamflow for each 10 increase in native forest area estimated for the temperate region of chile 40 s 1700 2500 mm annual precipitation lara et al 2009 it is interesting the similarity between both estimates despite their different methodology in which lara et al 2009 used a linear model that considered six 55 1460 ha catchments and native forests covered between 20 and 90 of each catchment with the reminder represented by forest plantations and shrublands lara et al 2009 the increase in q from the restoration of native forests documented for the pr scenario might revealing a likely better ecosystem response to disturbances such as the current megadrought and its consequences for example the 2017 mega fire that affected the region bowman et al 2019 could have been less severe under improved soil conditions and water content e g soto et al 2019 that might be enhanced by the restoration of native forests given these positive results on q it would be of interest to analysis them also in the context of other benefits related to the un sustainable development goals sdgs un 2015 like reduction of poverty sdg1 access to clean water sdg 6 and life on land sdg15 for example 4 2 impact of climate change during the period 2010 2018 precipitation and streamflow have decreased a 33 and 46 respectively in comparison to the period 1976 2009 the climate change scenarios used in this study project a further precipitation and streamflow decrease of around 15 and 32 respectively as well as a 0 95 c of warming from the relative differences in q it can be inferred that climate change is the greatest driver of the decrease in q fig 7 the reduction in p and the increase in atmospheric demand triggered by higher air temperatures are the main drivers that explain those trends in mediterranean catchments brown et al 2015 molina navarro et al 2016 regarding the magnitudes of change obtained in this study 32 at yearly scale ranging from 9 to 63 for the cc ww and cc dh simulations respectively similar results have been reported with simulations carried out with the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological model for the maule catchment which contains the cauquenes catchment which projected an annual runoff decrease of approximately 20 ranging from 5 increase to 60 decrease for the medium term 2040 2069 and under the rcp8 5 scenario bozkurt et al 2018 the pluvial nature of the cauquenes catchment could explain the sharp decrease on median flows 32 1 fig 7 as compared to maule catchment which has more nival contribution fig 2 a sharper decrease of qs would be obtained not shown if a longer historical climate period 1979 2006 would be chosen instead of the current one 2006 2018 this later period includes the mega drought which as mentioned above has already seen a 46 decrease in q with respect to the historical period hence the climate change effect must be considered with caution since it already includes the current mega drought effects 4 3 impact of the combined effect of cc and lulcc the combined effect of cc and lulcc have strong synergies with decreases in q ranging from 22 to 47 these results depict a much stronger reduction in q than previous studies in mediterranean catchments of europe for example a study of two catchments in portugal showed q reduction ranging from 13 to 18 serpa et al 2015 in these catchments the decrease in q was largely dominated by the cc effect and the drier catchment present a larger decrease of q another study from the vez catchment also in portugal under more humid climate showed a reduction of 9 annual water yield carvalho santos et al 2016 while the effect of cc only reduced water yield from 1 to 2 being larger the effect of afforestation with exotic plantations in this study the cc effect is greater than the one from afforestation which could be explained by the more severe rcp scenario chosen 8 5 instead of 4 5 and more severe projections of precipitation reductions for central chile than for south western europe collins et al 2013 ipcc 2013 in the european catchments a sharp decrease of summer q was reported which is not case in our study for fp and ex scenarios a possible explanation is related to differences in the history of land use changes in cauquenes large afforestation has already happened in the past little et al 2009 and currently 43 of the area is covered with exotic forest plantations meanwhile in the vez european catchment native shrublands and forests dominate the area this idea is reinforced when analyzing the adaptive scenarios since in both summer q are increased for cc projections fig 7 the pristine pr scenario allowed an important mitigation of the impact of cc on q reduction even with streamflow increases for the cc ww simulations this highlights the importance of preserving and restoring native forests for the recovery of water provision as a key ecosystem service stressing the need to consider both actions in the national strategy for the adaptation to cc in chile little and lara 2010 lara et al 2013 the increase in q observed during summer for the fld and pr scenarios are especially important since they represent the only possible source for drinking water and irrigated agriculture therefore strengthening the relationship between local water and food security these human primary necessities can be crucial in this territory affected by a structural poverty condition pino et al 2015 the positive impact of these lulcc scenarios should be evaluated under their broader co benefit and synergies to fulfill several sdgs 4 4 impacts on hydrological processes yearly simulated eta values during the present climate 626 to 751 mm for p radiata were in agreement with those found in southern australia where transpiration values ranging from 500 to 612 mm were obtained with two different formulations of a process based ecosystem model sheriff et al 1996 other studies in chile estimated values of 545 to 654 mm of yearly eta using a residual water balance approach in an area with slightly higher rainfall between 846 and 1056 mm including areas with clay rich soils huber and trecaman 2004 with respect to direct measurements of eta using eddy covariance systems values between 399 and 488 mm were registered in new zealand for a young 8 year old plantation established at high density arneth et al 1998 consequently higher amounts are expected for mature pines similarly putuhena cordery 2000 evaluated components of the water balance in p radiata plantations obtaining an annual et pp ratio of 68 on average being similar to the 65 obtained in our study area these results allow us to accept our yearly simulations of eta for p radiata as reasonable enough to draw conclusions about the effect of land cover replacement on qs simulated eta on shrublands was like those reported by meza et al 2018 for which eta p ratio of 0 64 was measured by an eddy covariance system in a much drier area of central chile 200 mm of annual precipitation discrepancies in terms of eta magnitudes 506 mm in cauquenes compared to 128 139 mm in the study of meza et al 2018 could be explained by the larger water stress condition of shrublands reported in the study of meza et al 2018 in this sense shrublands in our study area are taller with higher density and vigor and with more pastures in the surroundings which suggests that their water consumption should be greater in addition the shrubland composition often includes species of mid to late successional stage of the sclerophyll forest such as lithraea caustica luebert and pliscoff 2018 which has higher water requirements than the a caven shrubland bown et al 2018 hydrological components for the two land cover classes analyzed in this study allow us to conclude that there is a distinctive response in water yield during drier or wetter years our results showed that wy is much lower during the dry year than during the normal year especially for hrus with p radiata explained by the reduction in aswc fig 8d while keeping high rates of eta fig 8b despite this situation our results showed a 12 decrease in eta for p radiata under drier conditions which was exacerbated in our cc scenarios with larger decreases 27 compared with a normal year without cc the consequences could not only affect local water yield and q but also forest plantations growth alvarez et al 2012 navarro cerrillo et al 2018 thereby increasing susceptibility to wildfires bowman et al 2019 diseases caused by insects anderegg et al 2015 and especially water stress for young pine plantations which are especially susceptible due to their undeveloped rooting systems yang et al 2018 these effects indicate a low ecological resilience of p radiata plantations to drier conditions which has been reported for other planted pine species of spain guada et al 2016 this could threat the sustainability of the current forestry model and the international commitments towards carbon neutrality ndc in contrast our simulations suggested a better ecological response of shrublands during dry periods because they maintained a low eta rate preserving aswc and hence more water yield at the hru scale this eco hydrological behavior was measured for acacia caven shrubs where the soil water beyond 100 cm deep was not used leaving the remaining water for the following year as a reservoir sepulveda et al 2018 policy strategies based on massive afforestation to mitigate the impacts of climate change on water resources should be revised considering that in a drier future carbon allocation would not be granted by exotic forest plantations which can suffer from severe productivity restrictions in mediterranean like catchments of particular interest was the shrublands response which seems able to better manage reductions in water availability as demonstrated by the similar eta rates during both dry and normal years which could be an indication of a stable carbon sequestration the spatial distribution of hydrological components in normal and dry years depicts an expected pattern for p and et with higher levels in elevated areas where more water as p is available fig 9b similar spatial patterns for eta under normal years was previously reported for the same study area olivera guerra et al 2014 derived from a surface energy balance model based on satellite observations reinforcing the confidence in the results of our simulations of particular interest is the low eta rate reported in the lowland eastern zone dominated by forest plantations during dry years probably an indication of water stress the low levels of water yield and available soil water content data not shown in the same area confirm a possible situation of growth limitation affecting carbon sequestration and productivity ojeda et al 2018 another interesting result is the substantial change in wy magnitudes in the headwaters covered with pine plantations when comparing the normal and dry years this area maintained their eta but considerably reduced wy this could have consequences since this wy is critical to provide drinking water to downstream population and to sustain subsistence farming which is common in this area due to local poverty levels pino et al 2015 some remnants of one of the most diverse forest ecosystems of the chilean mediterranean hotspot with a high degree of endemism mittermeier et al 2004 are also located in this area therefore reduced water yield could seriously push it to the risk of collapse according to its endangered present situation alaniz et al 2016 this condition will be stressed under cc according to our simulations data not shown highlighting the current and future vulnerability of the territory the fld scenario was built to alleviate this situation however only a slight increase in q was observed in this scenario conversely in the pr scenario an important increase in q was observed suggesting that more substantial actions regarding protection and restoration of native forests should be taken to cope with water scarcity under climate change lara et al 2013 4 5 simulation limitations estimation of water use by the different vegetation types when the default swat parameterizations are used for our study area could lead to unrealistic representation of the carbon fluxes pathways eg radiation use efficiency especially nonagricultural land covers classes yang and zhang 2016 another issue is the real capability of water extraction by the roots of forest species since p radiata and a caven species are capable of extracting water from the soil below the conventional permanent wilting point thresholds huber et al 2010 meza et al 2018 in this sense forest covers also can extract water from the coarse fraction of soil which is not considered in the swat parameterization algayer et al 2020 those issues could lead to an underestimation of the real capability of water extraction by the roots affecting eta estimations especially during dry periods therefore simulations regarding eta dynamics should be taken with caution even if reasonable yearly values were obtained another limitation frequent in q simulations at the catchment scale is the amount and quality of soil information in our case this could remain highly uncertain even introducing local measurements of soil depth given large differences in soil physical properties according to land use soto et al 2019 finally spatial variation of p especially with elevation could affect the daily and monthly water balances even if we used a grid of p correctly validated by our local rain gauges heavy rainfall events can occur at high elevations as the episode of july 2019 where more than 150 mm d 1 exceptionally high were recorded at the headwaters this is not represented by the p grid used in this study and could lead to underestimation of q especially at daily scale adequate simulations of q under cc scenarios largely depend on the availability of local cc models in our study we used a simple but robust approach to represent the future climate conditions at the regional scale however more sophisticated methods do exists to cope with temporal variability of projections bozkurt et al 2018 piani et al 2010 finally another important issue not addressed in this study is the potential effect of increased atmospheric co2 concentrations on water use efficiency that could buffer the effect of a dyer climate on forests and other vegetation swann et al 2016 therefore affecting all components of the water balance 5 conclusions the study confirms a general decrease of water availability under global change scenarios which include five lulcc scenarios and climate change projections for a rainfed mediterranean catchment mainly covered with exotic industrial plantations of pinus radiata and native shrublands mainly covered by acacia caven lulcc scenarios related to the replacement of shrublands by pine forest plantations under present climate showed a decrease of annual q of 2 5 and 17 3 for the scenarios forest policy 2015 2035 fp and extreme ex respectively adaptive scenarios showed a positive to neutral response highlighting the role of native vegetation and the need of including them in future restoration strategies the forced land displacement fld scenario where plantation located in headwaters were moved downstream within an ecological restoration scheme resulted in an average increase of q of 2 3 while in the pristine scenario we got and estimated increase of 10 9 the latter highlights that protection of headwaters with native ecosystems seems to be able to favor infiltration and hence water availability downstream climate change alone leads to a reduction in p of 15 and in increase in air temperature of 0 95 c in our study area directly affecting potential et this situation amplifies the effect on q with a sharp decrease of 32 1 in annual values with respect to current climate 2006 2018 although when considering all 24 cc future projections variations in future q could be positive 10 increase for low warming and winter and spring precipitation increases the latter is with respect to a base period that includes the mega drought period where q has already decreased over 40 in the study region which provides a strong support for expecting drier future condition with respect to the historical period in this mediterranean region the combined effect of cc and lulcc leads to a negative synergy with decrease in mean annual q ranging from 46 2 ex to 23 3 pr adaptive scenarios partially reduce the negative effect of cc in streamflows especially during summer months when no other water resources are available strengthening the relationship between local food and water security this finding highlights the importance of preserving and restoring natural vegetation to alleviate the negative impacts of cc on water resources we found a low resilience of forest plantations to drier conditions in comparison to native shrublands as shown by an earlier depletion of soil water content and a reduction in actual et the tradeoff between the water and carbon cycle imposes limitations to carbon sequestration therefore compromising the chilean carbon policy adopted to cope with climate change a redesign of current and future land management strategies and the implementation of ecological restoration at catchment scale is urgently required to cope with the decrease in water availability imposed by climate change in south central chile decisions on future land management should include co benefits analysis to fulfill several sustainable development goals at the same time we expect the results presented in this study might have clear policy implication for chile and other countries where the allocation of state subsidies for the expansion of exotic plantations competes against the conservation and restoration of native vegetation the streamflow impacts of different land covers classes should be an important component of the discussions in this regard credit authorship contribution statement mauricio

4800,climate change cc along with land use and land cover change lulcc have a strong influence in water availability in already fragile mediterranean ecosystems in this work the soil and water assessment tool swat was implemented for the 2006 2018 period in a rainfed catchment of central chile 36 to test the hypothesis that adaptive plantation strategies could mitigate the impacts of climate change and increase streamflow we also hypothesize that afforestation with exotic tree plantations will reduce water availability in mediterranean catchments acting in synergy with climate change five lulcc scenarios are analyzed i current long term national forest policy fp ii extreme scenario ex with large afforestation surfaces both including the replacement of native shrublands with pinus radiata iii adaptive plantation management scenario fm with lower planting density iv forced land displacement scenario fld where plantations at the headwaters are moved to lowland areas and replaced with native shrublands and v pristine scenario pr with only native vegetation each lulcc scenario was run with present climate and with projections of different cmip5 climate models under the rcp 8 5 scenario for the period 2037 2050 and then compared against simulations based on the present land cover and climate simulations with the five lulcc scenarios fp ex fm fld and pr with present climate resulted in variations of 2 5 17 3 0 2 3 and 10 9 on mean annual streamflow q while simulations with the current land cover and cc projections produced a 32 1 decrease in mean annual q the joint impact of cc and lulcc leads to changes in mean annual q ranging from 46 2 ex to 23 3 pr afforestation with exotic pines will intensify the reduction in water yield while conservative scenarios focused on native forests protection and restoration could partially mitigate the effect of cc we make a strong call to rethink current and future land management strategies to cope with lower water availability in a drier future keywords lulcc exotic plantations native shrubland swat hydrological response sdgs 1 introduction societies already affected by water scarcity are struggling to devise effective ways to mitigate the negative impacts of global change on water availability both for human beings and ecosystems rossing 2010 mediterranean regions are particularly prone to droughts given observed and projected reduction of precipitation due to climate change cc polade et al 2017 rojas et al 2019 central chile 30 39 s has undergone a negative precipitation trend of approximately 4 per decade between 1960 and 2016 boisier et al 2018 accompanied by an increase in air temperature of about 0 18 c decade for the central depression for the 1979 2006 period falvey and garreaud 2009 the current decade is the warmest of the last 100 years and during the last nine years the so called chilean megadrought stands out as the longest and most extended dry period on record causing higher evaporation rates in water bodies larger evapotranspiration et from crops and natural vegetation and an accelerated melting of snow the hydrological response of catchments has also been affected causing an important reduction in streamflow q and shortages on drinking water for rural communities alvarez garreton et al 2018 garreaud et al 2017 a more severe effect is expected in the near future with projected reductions in precipitation of up to 30 leading to runoff reductions of about 40 under rcp8 5 bozkurt et al 2018 valdés pineda et al 2014 land use and land cover change lulcc is the other main driver of global change with important impacts at global and local scale one of the most important changes in land use is afforestation with commercial exotic tree plantations which increased from 167 5 to 277 9 million hectares worldwide between 1990 and 2015 temperate zones such as mediterranean regions represent 56 of this area payn et al 2015 south america is currently experiencing the rapid expansion of exotic species of commercial tree plantations jones et al 2016 in particular chile stands out as the fifth largest producer of roundwood in the world on the basis of fast growing monoculture plantations of pinus radiata and eucalyptus spp with short rotations of 18 and 10 12 years respectively jürgensen et al 2014 this timber industry is the second largest commercial export sector in chile after mining salas et al 2016 and it was consolidated in mid 1970 s with the implementation of state subsidies to encourage private sector participation in the expansion of forest plantations as a basis for the development of the private forest industry and exportations lara veblen 1993 thus planted area grew from 375 000 to 1 7 million hectares between 1970 and 1994 niklitschek 2007 and to 2 3 million hectares in 2015 infor 2015 concentrated mainly in the area located between 34 and 41 s specifically in the coastal mountain range armesto et al 2010 this area is intended to increase under the current 2015 2035 chilean forest policy to contribute to the country s economic and social development minagri 2015 absorption and sequestration of co2 by forests also play a significant role in chile s commitment to carbon neutrality by 2050 and is part of the country s nationally determined contributions ndc to fullfil international climate commitments defined in the ratification of the paris agreement government of chile 2020 worldwide several studies support the hypothesis of a strong negative impact of forest plantations on water yield when they replace other covers e g grasslands shrublands since they modify transpiration interception and evaporation processes within a catchment calder 2007 farley et al 2005 garmendia et al 2012 zhang et al 2011 2017 in chile some studies highlight this evidence at different scales in experimental plots and small scale catchments forest plantations have been associated with higher consumption of soil water compared to grasslands producing high et rates and low percolation huber et al 2008 p radiata plantations have been related to the high interception of canopy precipitation while actual et is fed exclusively by edaphic water during summer huber et al 2010 consistent results were obtained using satellite observations through an energy balance model over a landscape of south central chile where forest plantations showed higher et rates during spring olivera guerra et al 2014 in addition lara et al 2009 reported a negative correlation between annual and summer runoff and the forest plantation area in small coastal catchments of southern chile c 40 s while a positive correlation was found between runoff and the area of native forest cover during the dry season at a larger scale a decrease in summer runoff was reported in response to the increase in the area of p radiata plantations at the expense of native forest in the period 1975 2000 in two catchments of south central chile 252 and 650 km2 little et al 2009 in southern catchments of similar size decreasing flows during summer were found when afforestation was introduced using a statistical model iroumé palacios 2013 recently a study comprising 25 large forested catchments in south central chile showed a general decrease in q when shrublands pastures or native forest are replaced by exotic forest plantations using a statistical regression between precipitation and spatially distributed land cover data alvarez garreton et al 2019 on the other hand there is a wide range of studies that analyze changes in the hydrological cycle due to changes in land cover and or climate garmendia et al 2012 lu et al 2015 molina navarro et al 2016 stehr et al 2010 which have provided useful insights for water resources management gassman et al 2014 however only few studies serpa et al 2015 carvalho santos et al 2016 proposed to disentangle the joint effect of cc and lullc especially on the hydrological regime of mediterranean forested catchments process based hydrological models are some of the tools commonly used to evaluate changes in individual components of the hydrological cycle devia et al 2015 the soil and water assessment tool swat model was developed to predict the impact of land management practices and their use on water resources in large and complex catchments considering different soil types land use topography and management practices arnold et al 2012 this research aims to provide evidence for policy recommendations on land management strategies required to cope with lower water availability in mediterranean catchments where tree plantation afforestation is under discussion we hypothesize that adaptive plantation strategies could mitigate the impacts of climate change and increase streamflows additionally we hypothesize that afforestation with exotic tree plantations will reduce water availability in the mediterranean catchments acting in synergy with climate change to test these hypotheses we selected the cauquenes catchment 620 km2 located in the mediterranean south central chile as a case study this catchment was selected because large areas of native vegetation have been replaced by exotic tree plantations in the last decades and the current chilean forest policy threatens to exacerbate this trend in addition this catchment is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to high poverty pino et al 2015 and the presence of native ecosystems in danger of extinction alaniz et al 2016 hence decision on future land use change should consider addressing several objectives at the same time as is the call under the un 2030 agenda of the sustainable development goals sdgs 2 methodology the general framework of the methodology is displayed in fig 1 where we can distinguished four main themes i the swat implementation center with a general description of the hydrological modelling procedure e g calibration method

on the eastern slope of the coastal mountain range in south central chile fig 2 this catchment has a warm summer mediterranean climate csb in the köppen geiger classification and it is water limited according to budyko s dryness index mcvicar et al 2012 the annual precipitation is 814 mm concentrated from april to september with strong inter annual variability while the annual average temperature is 14 7 c according to a historical weather station located downstream with records since 1976 the catchment has no nival contribution so its hydrological regime is strictly rainfed with the highest flows during winter jja and the lowest water levels during summer djf in july streamflows reach values above 20 m3 s 1 50 of the time while during summer 100 of the time streamflows are below 2 m3 s 1 elevation ranges from 150 to 750 m a s l with an average of 317 m a s l and an average slope of 17 fig 2a the catchment provides ideal conditions to study the effect of land use on different components of the hydrological cycle for two main reasons i irrigation can be neglected since the anthropogenic activities are mainly rainfed crops or forest plantations ii it has little hydraulic infrastructure such as irrigation channels and reservoirs and iii it has a mosaic of land use classes with different water consumption rates which can be used for evaluating lulcc impacts on q it is important to note that the downstream area of the cauquenes river is of utmost importance for human activities such as agriculture recreational purposes and drinking water for rural and urban areas 2 2 the swat model the soil and water assessment tool swat is a process based catchment scale semi distributed hydrological model in swat each sub catchment is divided into hydrological response units hrus which consists of homogeneous areas in terms of soil type land cover slope and water management practices neitsch et al 2011 in this work hrus representative of the two main land cover types native shrublands and exotic forest plantations are used to study the evolution of individual components of the hydrological cycle precipitation actual evapotranspiration and water yield surface runoff is estimated with the modified scs curve number method while potential et was computed with the hargreaves equation both chosen based on input data availability the variable storage method was selected to route water through the drainage network for further details of the equations used to represent hydrological processes see the theoretical documentation of the model in neitsch et al 2011 the qswat software was used as an interface dile et al 2016 to prepare the input data used to run swat 2012 rev637 2 3 input data 2 3 1 topography and catchment delineation we used the 12 5 m tandem x digital elevation model of the german aerospace center and eads astrium to define the subcatchments we used the strahler method with a threshold of 12 5 km2 to define the minimum drainage area resulting in 26 subcatchments hrus are obtained considering slope bands of 10 20 30 and 30 and a minimum size of 2 5 of the corresponding subcatchments resulting in 233 hrus 2 3 2 land use land cover data land cover was generated using a supervised classification based on landsat oli satellite data for february 2016 following the methodology of chuvieco 2008 the overall accuracy oa was 86 5 and the kappa coefficient was 0 81 considered almost perfect landis koch 1977 the largest uncertainty corresponded to agriculture and pasturelands with baren areas which were confused by the classifier with shrublands a 7x7 filter and a 3x3 grouping were applied reallocating isolated and anomalous pixels to achieve a sharper spatial distribution of the categories then the classified land covers were assigned to existing vegetation categories in swat according to table 1 the area covered by the different land use land cover classes are forest plantations 43 shrublands 43 barren areas including clearcuts 10 native forests 3 urban areas town of quirihue 0 5 located in the southern portion of the catchment and agriculture and pasturelands 0 4 fig 3 2 3 3 soil data soils of cauquenes are classified as lithosols i lc c ciren 1997 and soil data was available as orthophotos at a 1 20 000 scale in addition we introduced physical properties measured in situ from the database of soto et al 2019 details of the data in supplementary material i following chen et al 2016 soil depth was fixed to 2 m for all land uses based on the average depth of the catchment according to global gridded soil information hengl et al 2017 but p radiata plantations and native forest were fixed to 3 m according to their capabilities to extract water from deeper horizons sand nambiar 1984 teskey sheriff 1996 huber et al 2010 2 3 4 climate data daily precipitation p and air temperature were obtained from three rain gauges three weather stations from public institutions for the 2006 2018 period and three rain gauges located in high elevation for the 2018 2019 period fig 2 and supplementary material ii for each subcatchment swat uses the closest climate and rain gauge station quality assessment of p data was performed using a double mass curve analysis gap filling was done using regressions with the nearest station less than 3 of missing data for temperature an exploratory analysis was used to verify anomalous data while gap filling was performed with linear regression with the nearest station on average less than 10 of missing data three virtual rain gauges were included to represent topographic effect as previously reported for chilean coastal range garreaud et al 2016 the daily 5 km resolution cr2met precipitation dataset http www cr2 cl datos productos grillados was used to provide three virtual rain gauges to represent high elevation rainfall this product was verified according to a point to pixel analysis against three rain gauge stations hobo rain gauge rg3 5 installed during the 2018 2019 period supplementary material ii satisfactory results were obtained with correlations ranging from 0 6 to 0 68 at daily scale and 0 93 to 0 98 at monthly scale 2 3 5 river discharge data daily observations were obtained from the río cauquenes en el arrayán discharge station supplementary material ii gap filling was not performed it has 95 data in the period in addition possible anthropogenic modifications to the measurements and data consistency were verified through the method of double mass curves with two streamflow stations río cauquenes en desembocadura 35 54 s 72 03 o and río purapel en sauzal 35 45 s 72 04 w 2 4 model implementation thirteen years of simulation period was chosen 2006 2018 for flow evaluation when land use changes are modified this period represents a compromise between a sufficient extensive time series of streamflow data and the stable landscape of the catchment represented by the current land cover reference scenario the model was run at the daily time step using 2006 2007 and 2008 2014 as warming up and calibration periods respectively the verification period considered years 2015 to 2018 2 4 1 parameter identification to reduce the number of parameters to be calibrated a sensitivity analysis was carried out for 15 parameters selected based on literature review the sensitivity analysis was carried out using a variance based global sensibility analysis technique sobol sobol 2001 saltelli et al 2010 this method provides an efficient and effective way to assess parameter sensitivity across a full range of parameter values model parameters were selected to represent the following hydrological processes runoff cn2 ch n 1 surlag and ov n groundwater gw delay rchrg dp gwqmn alpha bf revapmn and gw revap evapotranspiration epco and esco and water routing ch n 2 ch k 2 alpha bnk physical ranges used for the sensitivity analysis were obtained from the swat manual arnold et al 2012 neitsch et al 2011 with the exception of surlag gw delay and revapmn which ranges were obtained from brown et al 2015 heathman et al 2009 stehr et al 2010 van liew et al 2007 the meaning of the parameters is explained in the supplementary material iii 2 4 2 vegetation parameters the management and phenological cycle of forests plantations frse and shrublands shrb were represented with parameters obtained from the literature for similar local conditions obtained as described in table 2 2 4 3 calibration and verification calibration process was carried out with the default configuration of hydropso global optimization algorithm zambrano bigiarini rojas 2013 using the nash sutcliffe goodness of fit index nse as objective function the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the percentage of bias pbias and the ratio between the mean square error and the standard deviation of the data rsr were used as goodness of fit measures for calibration and verification in general monthly simulations are considered satisfactory when they satisfy nse 0 50 rsr 0 70 and pbias 25 moriasi et al 2007 2 5 global change scenarios 2 5 1 land use change scenarios six lulcc scenarios are analyzed fig 3 and table 3 the current land cover clc two describing an increase in forest plantation area fp ex one emulating a forest plantation management strategy fm and two conservative scenarios fld pr the effect of these scenarios on q are analyzed for present and future cc periods these scenarios represent the whole range of possible land cover modifications in the catchment and are described in the following paragraphs forest policy scenario fp this scenario represents one of the goals of the strategic axis productivity and economic growth of chilean government where afforestation of half a million of hectares preferably in forestry land belonging to small and medium size owners has to be done by 2035 without replacing native forest minagri 2015 low quality soils available to establish forest plantations were identified based on the soil aptitude map of ciren 1997 the small and medium sized owners 200 ha or less were identified with the cadastral map of rural properties ciren 2001 the current land cover map 2016 was used to identify all the areas covered by shrublands which were selected as the non native forest land cover to be transformed into exotic forest plantations keeping all other coverage constant finally a unique map was generated that integrates the previous criteria of land use modification through map algebra performed in qgis 2 6 9 8 of the current shrubland land cover that fulfill the three criteria described before were converted to p radiata plantations extreme scenario ex this scenario represents the replacement of all the existing native shrublands with exotic forest plantations we decided to include this extreme scenario given the current discussion about chile s strategies to fulfill the ndc s commitments government of chile 2020 with massive afforestation being discussed as a possibility although this scenario seems extreme a similar transformation already occurred in the past when the national forest policy afforestation subsidies and the expansion of the forest industry increased the surface planted with exotic trees in the region exponentially echeverria et al 2006 in addition shrubland ecosystems do not have a protection law that can avoid their conversion into forest plantations alaniz et al 2016 the total area of shrubland 42 7 of the catchment was converted to plantation present land use with forest management fm this scenario represents a cc adaptation strategy where forestry companies use a less intensive forest stand management to address current and projected water scarcity to emulate this situation we maintained the current land cover area but with lower density of tree plantations reducing the maximum leaf area index lai in the swat model we proposed a laimax 3 1 instead of 3 7 calculated by subtracting 60 of the standard deviation of lai measurements obtained from 13p radiata plots under similar site conditions described in álvarez et al 2012 forced land displacement fld this cc adaptation strategy is analyzed to protect water yield as a key ecosystem service in this scenario exotic plantations are moved from headwaters into lower land areas as an ecological strategy leaving their original area to be replaced by native shrublands this scenario considered natural regeneration of vegetation and is likely probable that shrublands will be established in the 2037 2050 period because future cc conditions would limit the development of actual native forest in terms of structure and composition due to its low rate of growth the increase of stressors like droughts change of seasonal phenology and insect herbivory xie et al 2015 yu et al 2016 estay et al 2019 huang et al 2020 the scenario considered natural regeneration of vegetation and according to ecological conditions is likely to similar scenarios have been proposed by other studies to quantify the effect of a technocratic like political decision into the provision of an ecosystem service manuschevich et al 2019 2800 ha of p radiata were displaced to lowlands and were replaced by shrublands from the lowland area pristine native vegetation pr this scenario replaces all the current exotic forest plantations with native forest and shrublands as part of a massive ecological restoration strategy to protect local endangered biodiversity it is created using the potential native vegetation belt proposed by luebert and pliscoff 2018 as the maximum area to represent the potential area cover by native forest and shrubland three vegetation belts are described for the catchment the deciduous forest of nothofagus glauca the sclerophyll forest of lithraea caustica and peumus boldus and the thorny forest of acacia caven and l caustica where the last two belts are defined as shrubland forest plantations were replaced by native forest and shrublands reaching a total of 26 8 and 61 4 of the total catchment area respectively 2 5 2 climate change scenarios a dataset of 26 global circulation models gcm from the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 was used to evaluate the effect of future climate change the simulations correspond to future projections following the representative concentration pathway 8 5 rcp8 5 high emissions scenario we decided to use this pessimistic scenario because it seems to be the business as usual and it represents a useful tool for quantifying physical climate risk especially over near to midterm policy relevant time horizon schwalm et al 2020 precipitation was first biased corrected and interpolated to a 25x25km grid using the methodology implemented in bozkurt et al 2018 monthly rainfall and the average temperature of the 26 gcms were compared against data from the three weather stations during the period 2006 2018 with respect to the annual cycle and interannual variability the results of the comparison indicated a good representation of the monthly climatology for all the models supplementary material iv except for miroc5 and fgoals g2 which were discarded of the subsequent analysis projected climate data were obtained using the delta method quilbé et al 2008 where future minimum and maximum temperatures are constructed by adding to the present day station data the δ t difference from the 24 gcms between the periods 2006 2018 and 2037 2050 see supplementary material v in the case of precipitation future precipitation is obtained by multiplying present day precipitation by the rp change between the two time periods the assumptions behind the delta method include that the effect of climate change is temporarily homogeneous during each month and the occurrence of rainfall remains the same as local data δ t s m 2037 2050 t cc s m y 13 2006 2018 t cc s m y 13 rp s m y 2037 2050 p cc s m y 13 y 2006 2018 p cc s

change 2 6 evaluation of the impact of global change on water yield to reduce the number of hydrological simulations only three future climate change scenarios were created for each lulcc scenario dry and hot climate change cc dh climate change multi model median cc mm and wetter and warmer climate change cc ww representing the first second median and third quartiles respectively of the p and t factors δ t r p of the selected 24 cc models cc dh was constructed by adding to the baseline climate for each month the mean delta of the 8 models that simulated the largest change in precipitation and temperature hence the driest and hottest case the cc mm was constructed by adding the multi model median for both variables and the cc ww by adding the 8 models with the least changes for each month i e the least warming and drying and even a small increase in precipitation these three scenarios are used as a sort of multi model low median and high climate scenarios mishra et al 2018 see supplementary material v for exact values the relative differences of q between the present condition 2006 2018 and different scenarios of global change were analyzed with the following equation r e l a t i v e d i f f e r e n c e s q scenario s q present s q present s 100 where q scenario s are streamflows simulated for scenarios lulcc and cc and q present s are streamflows simulated during the present period 2006 2020 relative percentage differences were calculated for the five lulcc scenarios the 24 cc models the cc dh cc mm and cc ww scenarios and the joint effect of lulcc and cc scenarios fig 1 2 7 spatio temporal analysis of hrus hydrological components a detailed evaluation of the changes in actual evapotranspiration eta available soil water content aswc and water yield wy was carried out for the 206 hrus representing forest plantations 98 and shrublands 108 considering the hydrological year april to march both cases were analyzed through monthly boxplots for a dry and a normal year during the megadrought the 2016 was the driest year of the simulation period during the megadrought period 2010 2018 when annual recorded p was 464 mm and mean q of in the cauquenes river was 1 5 m3 s 1 in the absence of wet years during the simulation period the 2015 year was considered as normal despite being placed within the megadrought as its annual p was 790 mm and mean annual q of 8 1 m3 s 1 which were like the average hydrometeorological conditions 886 mm of p and 8 9 m3 s 1of q for the 1976 2009 period to compute the hydrological components of hrus during the cc period only the cc mm scenario was chosen in addition the spatial distribution of the hydrological components during these periods were also analyzed for shrubland and forest plantation hrus by calculation of annual means during the dry and normal years 3 results 3 1 calibration and verification we calibrated 11 parameters based on results of the sobol sensitivity analysis the most sensitive parameter was the curve number cn corresponding to tree plantations and shrublands where the calibration range was set to 63 77 and 71 86 and the final calibrated values were 82 and 77 respectively the water routing parameter ch k was also sensitive the best parameter values obtained with the hydropso algorithm are summarized in supplementary material iii in general simulated q were able to represent observed flows except during highest winter events when model simulations underestimate peaks greater than 80 m3 s 1 at a daily scale fig 4 a and fig 4b daily and monthly model efficiencies during calibration and validation period were similar nash sutcliffe efficiencies obtained during calibration and verification were 0 75 and 0 72 at daily time scale and 0 88 and 0 88 at monthly scale respectively while the pbias and rsr were below 12 6 and 0 53 respectively for daily and monthly time scales table 4 therefore we consider our results as an acceptable representation of the hydrological processes occurring within our study area in particular a monthly time scale was considered for the further scenario analysis since it was classified as very good in the calibration and verification period in terms of nse and pbias moriasi et al 2007 3 2 climate change projections factors obtained through the delta method show an increase of tmax and tmin for all months and all models as well as a decrease of precipitation for most months and models although some models and for some months project an increase in p fig 5 and supplementary material v the construction of the three cc projections used to force the swat model show an average increase of 0 95 c cc mm for the period 2037 2050 with respect to 2006 2018 the cc dh and cc ww projections are on average 1 1 c and 0 85 c warmer respectively all three simulations cc mm cc dw and cc ww show largest warming in summer djf 1 06 c 1 25 and 0 89 c respectively and smallest warming in winter jja 0 81 c 0 92 c and 0 51 c respectively tmin are also projected to increase during all months and all models but in a smaller amount in the annual mean the cc mm cc dh and cc ww simulations increase 0 79 c 0 94 c and 0 62 c respectively again smallest increases are found for winter 0 61 c 0 72 c and 0 47 c respectively and largest for summer or autumn for precipitation in the cc mm scenario the average monthly delta factor is of 0 91 which represents a decrease in p in the order of 9 the largest decreases are projected for summer djf 14 and smallest in autumn of only 1 only six models showed delta values larger than 1 for p depicting an increment in the annual mean e g csiro mk3 6 0 with an average delta of 1 6 however most of the models i e 18 showed delta values lower than 1 for p with the lowest value of 0 66 for the ipsl cm5a lr the scenarios cc dh and cc ww correspond to annual mean p changes of 19 decrease and 4 increase respectively note that although the cc ww corresponds to a scenario with an overall increase of p summer and spring do not show a change and autumn and winter show a 4 and 5 increase with respect to 2006 2018 respectively 3 3 flow impact assessment for the current climate period 2006 2018 fig 6 a and supplementary material vi show the relative differences of mean annual q between present land cover and the lulcc scenarios a decrease of 2 5 and 17 3 of mean annual q is observed for the fp and ex scenarios and the decrease is accentuated in june with a median decrease of 4 5 and 31 8 respectively practically no changes in q were detected for the fm adaptive management scenario the fld scenario showed a general increase in flow with a mean annual increase of 2 3 and mean monthly values ranging from 0 1 in september to 4 1 in april the largest increase was observed for the pr scenario with a 10 9 increase in mean annual q with positive values in all months the lowest increase in april 3 9 and highest increase in december 15 2 hydrological simulations driven by the 24 climate change models and by the three future climate change scenarios cc dh cc mm cc ww with the current land cover are displayed in the clc cc scenario of fig 6b and fig 7 respectively a general reduction of q is observed when analyzing the 24 cc models individually according to monthly median reductions ranging from 17 1 in march to 57 4 in may however large spread in q simulations is also observed according to the size of the monthly boxplots which ranges up to 100 in july depicting positive values of relative difference in q for all months in cc mm a general decrease of 32 is found for q with largest decreases simulated for autumn mam of about 35 and lowest in summer djf of 27 in cc dh a sharp decrease of 61 5 is found with largest decreases simulated for winter jja of about 63 and lowest in summer of 58 in cc ww an increase of 9 is found with largest increases simulated for winter jja of about 20 and decreases in spring of 1 the combined effects of lulcc and cc scenarios on q are displayed in fig 7 when calculating streamflow differences with the cc mm q decreases regardless of the land use scenario used effects are largest for the ex simulation with a decrease of 46 6 followed by the fp and current land cover scenario clc with decrease of 34 and 32 respectively adaptive management scenarios showed q decreases of 31 7 29 5 and 22 3 for fm fld and pr scenarios respectively supplementary material vi when analyzing the effect of lulcc under cc dh scenario on q a similar hierarchy of q decrease was found with a sharp decrease for ex fp and clc with values of 72 63 and 62 respectively adaptive scenarios showed a lower decrease on q with values of 62 60 and 56 for the fm fld and pr scenarios respectively the cc ww scenario depicted a decrease on q only for ex with a value of 8 increases on q were found for the rest of lulcc scenarios with values of 9 7 9 12 and 24 for clc fp fm fld and pr respectively increases on flow are consequent with the projected precipitations which on average increases about 8 with respect to the p over the 2006 2018 period seasonal trends of q are similar than annual trends however summer q showed lower decreases than the rest of the seasons for the cc mm and the cc dh scenarios this is especially visible for pr with decreases on q of 50 to 14 for cc dh and cc mm winters q also followed a different trend for the cc ww scenario with larger increases for the clc fp fm and fld with respect to other seasons fig 7 3 4 3 4 impacts on hydrological processes fig 8 shows boxplots with the monthly values of actual evapotranspiration eta for the hrus fig 8a b available soil water content aswc fig 8c d and water yield wy fig 8e f of exotic forest plantations frse and native shrublands shrb for a normal and dry year both under present p and projected climate conditions cc for the normal year under the present climate conditions eta fig 8a showed a marked seasonal dynamic especially for p radiata frse with an increasing trend from august to december where the maximum values are reached then a sharp decrease in eta throughout the summer months djf until reaching the lowest levels in february shrublands shrb showed a lower eta dynamic with similar seasonality throughout the year and the maximum values reached in october they present lower amounts of aswc fig 8c than exotic plantations during winter however a sharp decrease starts in october for exotic plantations and extends until completely deplete it in january while shrublands keep aswc during the whole year regarding water yield wy fig 8e it showed a visible seasonality for the two land covers with high values in winter and practically zero values in summer for both land covers a large spread is also observed in july and august winter with higher variability for shrublands in comparison to the normal year the dry one present a similar seasonality and magnitude of eta and aswc for shrublands which is not the case for p radiata where an important reduction and an earlier decrease are observed fig 8b d total yearly eta was reduced from 709 to 623 mm for exotic plantations extremely low values of wy are observed for both land cover all along the year especially for exotic plantations fig 8f the latter situation agrees with the precipitation 464 mm and streamflow 1 5 m3 s 1 levels of this year 2016 considering the projected cc scenarios in a normal year a similar seasonality and magnitude is observed for eta and aswc for both land covers in comparison to the present climate fig 8a and fig 8c this was not the case for wy where an important decrease is projected under drier future projections a reduction of eta and aswc is estimated for both land covers especially for p radiata where yearly eta diminished from 683 to 518 mm fig 8b c earlier decrease is also estimated with aswc depletion in november finally fig 8e shows a sharp decrease in wy for both land covers in winter jja months where the total yearly wy did not exceed 32 mm for pines the present spatial distribution of hydrological components is displayed in fig 9 for a normal and dry year respectively a clear spatial relation between precipitation and eta is depicted with high values located at the high elevation lands in the western part of the catchment fig 2 this relation was consistent during normal and dry years the eastern part of the catchment where abundant forest plantations are present fig 3 exhibited relatively high values of eta ranging from 605 to 658 mm of eta under normal years fig 9b however this situation changed for the dry year where the same area showed much lower values ranging from 446 to 507 mm of eta fig 9e wy showed a different spatial pattern with high values in normal years located in the high elevation areas of the northwestern and central part of the catchment fig 9 c lower values of wy are observed for the western and southeastern part of the catchment where most of the exotic forest plantations are located fig 9c and fig 3 during the dry year wy a considerable reduction in wy magnitudes was observed e g maximum range fall from 717 mm to 214 mm the western area mainly cover with exotic plantations showed a marked decreased in wy moving from 300 to 400 mm in normal year to 50 100 mm in a dry year fig 9f and fig 3 4 discussion 4 1 impact of lulcc the decrease in q observed with the expansion of exotic forest plantations fp and ex scenarios is in agreement with different reviews and meta analysis documenting that afforestation with non native species have reduced water yield in different regions of the world and that this decrease is enhanced under dry conditions e g farley et al 2005 scott prinsloo 2008 filoso et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 ferraz et al 2019 several studies report the negative effect of the expansion of forest plantations on streamflow in mediterranean areas in an australian catchment with an et pp ratio similar to our study the conversion and replacement of 10 to 50 of the pasture area with plantations generated a decrease in q between 1 and 3 6 nguyen et al 2017 this is like the 2 5 decrease in q reported in our catchment when 10 of the area originally covered with shrublands is replaced by plantations but less than the 17 3 change in q when 43 of its area covered with shrubland is replaced by pines these differences could be explained by the size of the catchments since cauquenes is three times bigger than the one studied by nguyen et al 2017 and this could amplify the q decrease in our study pilgrim et al 1982 gallo et al 2015 in spite of these differences similar results have been reported by carvalho santos et al 2016 in a mediterranean catchment in europe with a decrease of 7 when introducing 63 5 of eucalyptus plantation in the southern portion of the temperate mediterranean region of chile 38 39 s with a mean annual precipitation of 1650 mm and a dry season of five months stehr et al 2010 reported a reduction of 10 6 in q for a scenario of 96 increase in exotic forest plantations for the vergara catchment 133 km2 at the expense of shrublands and agricultural lands their estimate is lower compared to the 17 3 estimated in q for our ex scenario with a 43 increase in forest plantations area higher precipitation and a different soil pedogenesis with deeper volcanic soils in contrast to the lithosols present in cauquenes which are shallower and with a higher bulk density and lower water storage capacity soto et al 2019 may explain differences in the magnitude of streamflow reduction alvarez garreton et al 2019 carried out a regression model in 25 chilean catchments to assess the impact on q from the replacement of several land cover classes with exotic tree plantations their study considered cauquenes catchment as one of the 13 drier catchments aridity indices ranging from 0 17 to 1 5 and they found a 3 decrease in q after a replacement of 6000 ha of shrublands in this catchment these results were like the change obtained for our fp scenario 2 5 in which 5600 ha of shrublands were replaced by p radiata the consistency of the decrease in q obtained by this statistical approach and our process based modelling results reinforce the confidence in the robustness of our analysis another study done at the cauquenes catchment documented forest plantation area increased from 20 to 42 22 from 1990 to 2000 and estimated a 31 9 reduction in summer streamflow for the period 1991 2000 compared to 1981 1990 using a linear model from the changes in runoff q p residuals little et al 2009 their estimate is higher than the 17 3 decrease in q for our ex scenario where forest plantations increased by 43 despite using different methods and reference periods differences between both estimates might be explained by the steep reduction of streamflow during the first rotation of plantations when they were not only expanding but actively growing with similar age classes before the first clear cut conversely the model built in this study estimated the water yield of plantations compared to other land uses for the 2006 2018 period when plantations formed a mosaic of age classes and development stages after two or three 16 18 year rotations that are commonly used for pines in chile this becomes clear since total area of plantations was estimated in 42 for 2000 little et al 2009 which remains stable 43 in 2016 estimated by us indicating this shifting mosaic of age classes that buffers the effect of plantations on reducing streamflow as they age in short rotations farley et al 2005 this indicates that streamflow for the fp and especially for the ex scenario might probably reach a much lower value when all the plantations are in their first rotation in the next 15 20 years i e in 2033 2038 than the one we estimated for the 2037 2050 period adaptive scenarios fm fld pr showed positive to neutral responses highlighting the role of native vegetation and possible restoration strategies the less intense stand plantation management scenario fm in fig 6a represented with a decrease in maximum lai did not produce important changes in q this was a counterintuitive result given the evidence about the importance of this variable in the use of water in tree plantations barrientos iroumé 2018 the sensitivity of this parameter in the swat model seems to be misrepresented under certain forest ecosystems yang and zhang 2016 nonetheless the fld scenario showed an increase 2 3 in q resulting in a partial mitigation of the impact of tree plantations results regarding the strategy proposed in our fld scenario highlights that protection of headwaters with native ecosystem seems to be able to favor infiltration and hence water availability downstream buttle 2011 the pristine pr scenario showed an 11 increase in annual q for a change in native area cover from 2 7 in 2018 to 26 8 24 1 increase this increase is like the 14 1 rise in summer streamflow for each 10 increase in native forest area estimated for the temperate region of chile 40 s 1700 2500 mm annual precipitation lara et al 2009 it is interesting the similarity between both estimates despite their different methodology in which lara et al 2009 used a linear model that considered six 55 1460 ha catchments and native forests covered between 20 and 90 of each catchment with the reminder represented by forest plantations and shrublands lara et al 2009 the increase in q from the restoration of native forests documented for the pr scenario might revealing a likely better ecosystem response to disturbances such as the current megadrought and its consequences for example the 2017 mega fire that affected the region bowman et al 2019 could have been less severe under improved soil conditions and water content e g soto et al 2019 that might be enhanced by the restoration of native forests given these positive results on q it would be of interest to analysis them also in the context of other benefits related to the un sustainable development goals sdgs un 2015 like reduction of poverty sdg1 access to clean water sdg 6 and life on land sdg15 for example 4 2 impact of climate change during the period 2010 2018 precipitation and streamflow have decreased a 33 and 46 respectively in comparison to the period 1976 2009 the climate change scenarios used in this study project a further precipitation and streamflow decrease of around 15 and 32 respectively as well as a 0 95 c of warming from the relative differences in q it can be inferred that climate change is the greatest driver of the decrease in q fig 7 the reduction in p and the increase in atmospheric demand triggered by higher air temperatures are the main drivers that explain those trends in mediterranean catchments brown et al 2015 molina navarro et al 2016 regarding the magnitudes of change obtained in this study 32 at yearly scale ranging from 9 to 63 for the cc ww and cc dh simulations respectively similar results have been reported with simulations carried out with the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological model for the maule catchment which contains the cauquenes catchment which projected an annual runoff decrease of approximately 20 ranging from 5 increase to 60 decrease for the medium term 2040 2069 and under the rcp8 5 scenario bozkurt et al 2018 the pluvial nature of the cauquenes catchment could explain the sharp decrease on median flows 32 1 fig 7 as compared to maule catchment which has more nival contribution fig 2 a sharper decrease of qs would be obtained not shown if a longer historical climate period 1979 2006 would be chosen instead of the current one 2006 2018 this later period includes the mega drought which as mentioned above has already seen a 46 decrease in q with respect to the historical period hence the climate change effect must be considered with caution since it already includes the current mega drought effects 4 3 impact of the combined effect of cc and lulcc the combined effect of cc and lulcc have strong synergies with decreases in q ranging from 22 to 47 these results depict a much stronger reduction in q than previous studies in mediterranean catchments of europe for example a study of two catchments in portugal showed q reduction ranging from 13 to 18 serpa et al 2015 in these catchments the decrease in q was largely dominated by the cc effect and the drier catchment present a larger decrease of q another study from the vez catchment also in portugal under more humid climate showed a reduction of 9 annual water yield carvalho santos et al 2016 while the effect of cc only reduced water yield from 1 to 2 being larger the effect of afforestation with exotic plantations in this study the cc effect is greater than the one from afforestation which could be explained by the more severe rcp scenario chosen 8 5 instead of 4 5 and more severe projections of precipitation reductions for central chile than for south western europe collins et al 2013 ipcc 2013 in the european catchments a sharp decrease of summer q was reported which is not case in our study for fp and ex scenarios a possible explanation is related to differences in the history of land use changes in cauquenes large afforestation has already happened in the past little et al 2009 and currently 43 of the area is covered with exotic forest plantations meanwhile in the vez european catchment native shrublands and forests dominate the area this idea is reinforced when analyzing the adaptive scenarios since in both summer q are increased for cc projections fig 7 the pristine pr scenario allowed an important mitigation of the impact of cc on q reduction even with streamflow increases for the cc ww simulations this highlights the importance of preserving and restoring native forests for the recovery of water provision as a key ecosystem service stressing the need to consider both actions in the national strategy for the adaptation to cc in chile little and lara 2010 lara et al 2013 the increase in q observed during summer for the fld and pr scenarios are especially important since they represent the only possible source for drinking water and irrigated agriculture therefore strengthening the relationship between local water and food security these human primary necessities can be crucial in this territory affected by a structural poverty condition pino et al 2015 the positive impact of these lulcc scenarios should be evaluated under their broader co benefit and synergies to fulfill several sdgs 4 4 impacts on hydrological processes yearly simulated eta values during the present climate 626 to 751 mm for p radiata were in agreement with those found in southern australia where transpiration values ranging from 500 to 612 mm were obtained with two different formulations of a process based ecosystem model sheriff et al 1996 other studies in chile estimated values of 545 to 654 mm of yearly eta using a residual water balance approach in an area with slightly higher rainfall between 846 and 1056 mm including areas with clay rich soils huber and trecaman 2004 with respect to direct measurements of eta using eddy covariance systems values between 399 and 488 mm were registered in new zealand for a young 8 year old plantation established at high density arneth et al 1998 consequently higher amounts are expected for mature pines similarly putuhena cordery 2000 evaluated components of the water balance in p radiata plantations obtaining an annual et pp ratio of 68 on average being similar to the 65 obtained in our study area these results allow us to accept our yearly simulations of eta for p radiata as reasonable enough to draw conclusions about the effect of land cover replacement on qs simulated eta on shrublands was like those reported by meza et al 2018 for which eta p ratio of 0 64 was measured by an eddy covariance system in a much drier area of central chile 200 mm of annual precipitation discrepancies in terms of eta magnitudes 506 mm in cauquenes compared to 128 139 mm in the study of meza et al 2018 could be explained by the larger water stress condition of shrublands reported in the study of meza et al 2018 in this sense shrublands in our study area are taller with higher density and vigor and with more pastures in the surroundings which suggests that their water consumption should be greater in addition the shrubland composition often includes species of mid to late successional stage of the sclerophyll forest such as lithraea caustica luebert and pliscoff 2018 which has higher water requirements than the a caven shrubland bown et al 2018 hydrological components for the two land cover classes analyzed in this study allow us to conclude that there is a distinctive response in water yield during drier or wetter years our results showed that wy is much lower during the dry year than during the normal year especially for hrus with p radiata explained by the reduction in aswc fig 8d while keeping high rates of eta fig 8b despite this situation our results showed a 12 decrease in eta for p radiata under drier conditions which was exacerbated in our cc scenarios with larger decreases 27 compared with a normal year without cc the consequences could not only affect local water yield and q but also forest plantations growth alvarez et al 2012 navarro cerrillo et al 2018 thereby increasing susceptibility to wildfires bowman et al 2019 diseases caused by insects anderegg et al 2015 and especially water stress for young pine plantations which are especially susceptible due to their undeveloped rooting systems yang et al 2018 these effects indicate a low ecological resilience of p radiata plantations to drier conditions which has been reported for other planted pine species of spain guada et al 2016 this could threat the sustainability of the current forestry model and the international commitments towards carbon neutrality ndc in contrast our simulations suggested a better ecological response of shrublands during dry periods because they maintained a low eta rate preserving aswc and hence more water yield at the hru scale this eco hydrological behavior was measured for acacia caven shrubs where the soil water beyond 100 cm deep was not used leaving the remaining water for the following year as a reservoir sepulveda et al 2018 policy strategies based on massive afforestation to mitigate the impacts of climate change on water resources should be revised considering that in a drier future carbon allocation would not be granted by exotic forest plantations which can suffer from severe productivity restrictions in mediterranean like catchments of particular interest was the shrublands response which seems able to better manage reductions in water availability as demonstrated by the similar eta rates during both dry and normal years which could be an indication of a stable carbon sequestration the spatial distribution of hydrological components in normal and dry years depicts an expected pattern for p and et with higher levels in elevated areas where more water as p is available fig 9b similar spatial patterns for eta under normal years was previously reported for the same study area olivera guerra et al 2014 derived from a surface energy balance model based on satellite observations reinforcing the confidence in the results of our simulations of particular interest is the low eta rate reported in the lowland eastern zone dominated by forest plantations during dry years probably an indication of water stress the low levels of water yield and available soil water content data not shown in the same area confirm a possible situation of growth limitation affecting carbon sequestration and productivity ojeda et al 2018 another interesting result is the substantial change in wy magnitudes in the headwaters covered with pine plantations when comparing the normal and dry years this area maintained their eta but considerably reduced wy this could have consequences since this wy is critical to provide drinking water to downstream population and to sustain subsistence farming which is common in this area due to local poverty levels pino et al 2015 some remnants of one of the most diverse forest ecosystems of the chilean mediterranean hotspot with a high degree of endemism mittermeier et al 2004 are also located in this area therefore reduced water yield could seriously push it to the risk of collapse according to its endangered present situation alaniz et al 2016 this condition will be stressed under cc according to our simulations data not shown highlighting the current and future vulnerability of the territory the fld scenario was built to alleviate this situation however only a slight increase in q was observed in this scenario conversely in the pr scenario an important increase in q was observed suggesting that more substantial actions regarding protection and restoration of native forests should be taken to cope with water scarcity under climate change lara et al 2013 4 5 simulation limitations estimation of water use by the different vegetation types when the default swat parameterizations are used for our study area could lead to unrealistic representation of the carbon fluxes pathways eg radiation use efficiency especially nonagricultural land covers classes yang and zhang 2016 another issue is the real capability of water extraction by the roots of forest species since p radiata and a caven species are capable of extracting water from the soil below the conventional permanent wilting point thresholds huber et al 2010 meza et al 2018 in this sense forest covers also can extract water from the coarse fraction of soil which is not considered in the swat parameterization algayer et al 2020 those issues could lead to an underestimation of the real capability of water extraction by the roots affecting eta estimations especially during dry periods therefore simulations regarding eta dynamics should be taken with caution even if reasonable yearly values were obtained another limitation frequent in q simulations at the catchment scale is the amount and quality of soil information in our case this could remain highly uncertain even introducing local measurements of soil depth given large differences in soil physical properties according to land use soto et al 2019 finally spatial variation of p especially with elevation could affect the daily and monthly water balances even if we used a grid of p correctly validated by our local rain gauges heavy rainfall events can occur at high elevations as the episode of july 2019 where more than 150 mm d 1 exceptionally high were recorded at the headwaters this is not represented by the p grid used in this study and could lead to underestimation of q especially at daily scale adequate simulations of q under cc scenarios largely depend on the availability of local cc models in our study we used a simple but robust approach to represent the future climate conditions at the regional scale however more sophisticated methods do exists to cope with temporal variability of projections bozkurt et al 2018 piani et al 2010 finally another important issue not addressed in this study is the potential effect of increased atmospheric co2 concentrations on water use efficiency that could buffer the effect of a dyer climate on forests and other vegetation swann et al 2016 therefore affecting all components of the water balance 5 conclusions the study confirms a general decrease of water availability under global change scenarios which include five lulcc scenarios and climate change projections for a rainfed mediterranean catchment mainly covered with exotic industrial plantations of pinus radiata and native shrublands mainly covered by acacia caven lulcc scenarios related to the replacement of shrublands by pine forest plantations under present climate showed a decrease of annual q of 2 5 and 17 3 for the scenarios forest policy 2015 2035 fp and extreme ex respectively adaptive scenarios showed a positive to neutral response highlighting the role of native vegetation and the need of including them in future restoration strategies the forced land displacement fld scenario where plantation located in headwaters were moved downstream within an ecological restoration scheme resulted in an average increase of q of 2 3 while in the pristine scenario we got and estimated increase of 10 9 the latter highlights that protection of headwaters with native ecosystems seems to be able to favor infiltration and hence water availability downstream climate change alone leads to a reduction in p of 15 and in increase in air temperature of 0 95 c in our study area directly affecting potential et this situation amplifies the effect on q with a sharp decrease of 32 1 in annual values with respect to current climate 2006 2018 although when considering all 24 cc future projections variations in future q could be positive 10 increase for low warming and winter and spring precipitation increases the latter is with respect to a base period that includes the mega drought period where q has already decreased over 40 in the study region which provides a strong support for expecting drier future condition with respect to the historical period in this mediterranean region the combined effect of cc and lulcc leads to a negative synergy with decrease in mean annual q ranging from 46 2 ex to 23 3 pr adaptive scenarios partially reduce the negative effect of cc in streamflows especially during summer months when no other water resources are available strengthening the relationship between local food and water security this finding highlights the importance of preserving and restoring natural vegetation to alleviate the negative impacts of cc on water resources we found a low resilience of forest plantations to drier conditions in comparison to native shrublands as shown by an earlier depletion of soil water content and a reduction in actual et the tradeoff between the water and carbon cycle imposes limitations to carbon sequestration therefore compromising the chilean carbon policy adopted to cope with climate change a redesign of current and future land management strategies and the implementation of ecological restoration at catchment scale is urgently required to cope with the decrease in water availability imposed by climate change in south central chile decisions on future land management should include co benefits analysis to fulfill several sustainable development goals at the same time we expect the results presented in this study might have clear policy implication for chile and other countries where the allocation of state subsidies for the expansion of exotic plantations competes against the conservation and restoration of native vegetation the streamflow impacts of different land covers classes should be an important component of the discussions in this regard credit authorship contribution statement mauricio

4801,the impacts of long term pumping on groundwater flow patterns and groundwater chemistry are unclear in the manas river basin an arid inland basin in northwest china in this study hydraulic heads hydrochemistry and environmental isotopic tracers were analyzed to reveal groundwater flow patterns recharge sources and deduce hydrogeochemical processes in this highly exploited aquifer system spatial trends in the isotopic ratios δ18o and δ2h indicate that groundwater originates from glacial melting and precipitation in the mountainous area in the piedmont plains dissolution of calcite gypsum and dolomite yields a groundwater type dominated by ca hco3 so4 with tds of 300 mg l in this area high 3h concentrations demarcate local flow systems and imply modern precipitation recharge downgradient in the lowlands irrigation return flow recharges shallow groundwater through local flow paths groundwater pumping has intensified vertical hydraulic gradients causing vertical mixing between aquifers generally across the basin regional flow systems contain groundwater with 14c ages ranging from modern to 33 000 years with the oldest waters found in wells with depths greater than 200 m from high to low elevation groundwater chemistry transitions from ca hco3 so4 to na cl so4 type as concentrations of cl and overall tds increase the replacement of ca2 with na as the dominant cation suggests reverse ion exchange and carbonate precipitation occur along the intermediate and regional flow paths anthropogenic activities i e pumping irrigation return flow application of fertilizers impact shallow groundwater chemistry 60 m this research reveals the impacts of natural and human induced hydrogeochemical processes impacting groundwater chemistry in this basin with implications for similar semi arid to arid inter montane basins around the world keywords groundwater flow patterns hydrogeochemistry environmental isotopes manas river basin northwest china 1 introduction water scarcity commonly resulting in water use conflicts has become a great concern in the management of river basins especially in arid and semi arid regions around the world white et al 2014 in these basins massive quantities of stored groundwater play a vital role in sustaining human and ecological systems increasing water demands to satisfy rapid growth in agriculture to provide food for mostly urban populations as well as industrial growth have greatly increased groundwater exploitation leading to permanent water table declines grogan et al 2015 joshi et al 2018 large scale groundwater exploitation has caused many eco environmental problems these include land subsidence groundwater quality degradation reduction in baseflow to rivers and springs resulting in their seasonal or even permanent disappearance and negative impacts on baseflow dependent ecosystems fishman et al 2011 kurunc et al 2016 tweed et al 2018 therefore the sustainable utilization of groundwater resources in agricultural regions in arid inland basins is a challenge that will demand coordinated policy responses to achieve desirable social economic and ecological outcomes worldwide hoogesteger and wester 2017 villholth et al 2018 understanding the various groundwater flow pathways from recharge to discharge is critical for sustainable utilization of groundwater resources and maintaining ecosystems in arid inland basins according to toth 1963 groundwater flow systems can be divided into three types local intermediate and regional hydrogeologists commonly demarcate these flow systems through analysis of topography and by considering the three dimensional structure of the geological layers and their hydraulic properties most important being hydraulic conductivity k groundwater velocities flow path residence times and chemical compositions vary with mineralogical composition hydraulic properties land topography and the scale of the aquifer system brkic et al 2016 in recent decades hydrogeochemical and isotopic data have been applied to locate and quantify aquifer recharge discharge and surface water runoff furthermore isotopes and chemistry have been used to identify the hydraulic connection within and between aquifers and demarcate groundwater flow paths han et al 2009 2010 hatipoglu et al 2009 bretzler et al 2011 pavlovskiy and selle 2015 sun et al 2016 woldmariyam and ayenew 2016 kagabu et al 2017 joshi et al 2018 however in irrigated regions screened intervals of production wells are typically long spanning tens to hundreds of meters to yield the largest amount of groundwater during irrigation period intensive pumping from long screened production wells causes the downward advection of shallow aquifer water into deep aquifer leading to mixtures in groundwater residence times and chemistry edmunds 2001 ayotte et al 2011 knappett et al 2017 the mixture of modern water and much older groundwater occur as evident in samples collected from globally distributed and diverse aquifers jasechko 2016 jasechko et al 2017 these mixing processes between water of different ages within the aquifer pose difficulties for estimation of residence times using environmental tracer ma et al 2019 due to the complexity of groundwater systems in arid inland basins where the groundwater is pumped for irrigated agriculture the systematic understanding of groundwater flow systems is still inadequate villholth et al 2018 specifically the impacts of intensive groundwater pumping on groundwater flow patterns and groundwater geochemistry are under studied this limits scientist s ability to predict the impacts of intense groundwater pumping on the region s ecosystems e g land subsidence reduction in the base flow of springs and rivers saltwater intrusion damage to aquatic ecosystems the manas river basin mrb is located in northwest china it is typical of mountain oasis desert inland river basins in which the natural pre development low lying discharge area is occupied by saline lake manas lake salt playas and salt crusts the present day oases which are no longer fed by artesian springs but rather created by damming of streams are surrounded by cultivated land urban and residential land and gardens liu et al 2010a 2010b zhang et al 2012a ling et al 2013 numerous surface water reservoirs have been built within the mrb in the past fifty years to supply the growing local population and agriculture cheng et al 2006 ling et al 2011 the surface area of these reservoirs increased from 336 to 6 590 km2 between 1949 and 2010 while the population increased from 55 600 to 1 120 000 ling et al 2012 zhang et al 2012b rapid population and agricultural growth have been achieved through the extraction of approximately 7 3 108 m3 of groundwater during the past fifty years a study by ling et al 2010 estimated that a staggering 58 of the stored fresh groundwater has already been extracted there are over 10 000 long screened production wells in the mrb long well screens allow cross formational flow which may increase the downward advection of shallow brackish groundwater mayo 2010 ayotte et al 2011 izbicki et al 2015 this brackish water formed by thousands of years of upward groundwater discharge combined with evaporation the result is playa lakes such as the highly saline manas lake tds 385 720 mg l liu et al 2018 intensive pumping from these long screened wells has caused the water table to decline by 10 60 m in various locations since the 1960s chen et al 2009 pumping from the deep aquifers 180 m increased the vertical hydraulic gradients reversing the natural flow direction from upward to downward and causing the groundwater to leak from upper shallow aquifers to deep aquifers this is likely driving changes to groundwater flow systems in the past sixty years chen et al 2009 however the specific impacts of pumping on groundwater flow patterns and the resulting changes to groundwater geochemistry are unclear the main objective of this study is to characterize the groundwater flow systems within intensively pumped aquifers through an integrated analysis of major ion chemistry stable isotopes 2h 18o and radio isotopes 3h and 14c in the mrb the specific aims are to identify groundwater recharge sources determine the controlling mechanisms on groundwater geochemistry analyze groundwater mixing characteristics and delineate groundwater flow patterns this research enhances our understanding of natural and human impacted groundwater flow systems not only in the mrb northwest china but in similar semi arid to arid inland basins around the world 2 study area 2 1 location and climate the manas river basin is located in the southern part of the junggar basin xinjiang province fig 1 it lies between latitudes 43 05 to 45 58 n and longitudes 84 42 to 86 35 e with an area of 17 600 km2 stretching from the taxi river in the east to the bayingou river in the west and from tianshan mountains in the south to manas lake in the north the volumetric flux of surface runoff from the mountains is dominated by five stream systems with an average flux of 2 0 109 m3 a ling et al 2010 2012 the five stream systems are bayingou river jingou river ningjia river manas river and taxi river in order from west to east as the largest inland river north of the tianshan mountains the manas river originates from the permanent glaciated terrain located over 5 000 m above sea level m asl and flows through gurbantunggut desert with a total length of 400 km and annual runoff volume of 12 108 m3 a shi et al 2010 the mrb has a continental arid climate characterized by hot dry summers and cold winters cheng et al 2006 the mean annual air temperature is 5 9 6 6 and 6 8 c in the piedmont plains oasis plains and oasis desert transition zone respectively for the same respective zones the mean annual precipitation varies from 190 to 630 150 to 200 and 110 to 140 mm and the average annual pan evaporation in the three respective zones is 1 100 1 800 1 500 2 400 and 1 700 2 500 mm ling et al 2013 zhao 2013 in the mrb 60 80 of the precipitation occurs during the period of june to august and the evaporation is far greater than the precipitation during the whole year cheng et al 2006 2 2 geological and hydrogeological settings the mrb is divided into five geomorphic units mountainous areas zone 1 piedmont plains zone 2 oasis plains zone 3 oasis desert transition zone zone 4 and deserts zone 5 fig 1b in order from the maximum elevation of 5 243 m asl in the mountains to a low of 256 m asl in northern terminal manas lake cheng et al 2006 the mountains and the plains are comprised of unconsolidated sediments which were deposited during the early and middle yanshanian and late himalaya periods shi et al 2004 the mesozoic strata in the basin are mainly distributed in the mountainous areas whereas the piedmont and oasis plains are comprised of cenozoic strata including neogene and quaternary deposits fig 2 bedrock sandy conglomerate clay and siltstone are widely distributed throughout the basin in the mountainous areas the aquifers are composed of granites sedimentary formation of devonian and carboniferous age and mesozoic limestone shi et al 2004 in the piedmont plains the phreatic aquifer is comprised of gravel and sand gravel of quaternary age currently the water table lies more than 50 m below land surface and hydraulic conductivity k ranges from 80 to 130 m d liu et al 2006 2010a 2010b in the oasis plains and oasis desert transition zone the coarse phreatic aquifer transitions to a multilayer structured system of unconfined and confined aquifers and aquitards the aquitards are comprised of sandy clay and clay aquifer k values range from 7 to 37 m d liu et al 2006 2010a 2010b generally groundwater in the mrb originates from the mountainous area and flows horizontally from the piedmont to the lowlands and finally into manas lake which represents the terminal discharge area under natural conditions owing to human activities reservoir construction efforts of minimize channel seepage groundwater exploitation the natural flow systems have been changed chen et al 2009 this resulted in a decrease of artesian spring flow cones of depression at the margins of the deserts and groundwater leakage from shallow to deep aquifers the main sources of groundwater recharge are vertical infiltration from rivers lateral subsurface flow from the piedmont zone and irrigation return flow in the lowlands the main discharge mechanisms are pumping springs and evapotranspiration 3 materials and methods water samples were collected between april and september 2016 including 9 surface water river and reservoir samples 3 rainfall samples and 107 groundwater samples fig 3 rainfall samples were collected in the piedmont plains oasis plains and oasis desert transition zone river water samples were obtained from the upper reach of manas river in the mountains reservoir water was sampled at the shore groundwater samples were collected from production wells spanning depths from 18 to 420 m across the study area these wells fell into three groups based on depth shallow 60 m intermediate 60 to 180 m and deep 180 m as most production wells are actively pumped for irrigation and domestic water demands these wells were constructed with long screened intervals to maximize yields the screen lengths range from 80 to 250 m below the ground surface yang et al 2017 and the water table occurs within the screen intervals in many cases during sampling field parameters such as electrical conductivity ec temperature t and ph were measured in situ using hach 40d instruments hach inc loveland colorado united states the concentrations of co3 2 and hco3 were determined by the titration method with 0 05 n hcl all water samples for major ion analysis were filtered through 0 45 μm millipore syringe filters and stored in

hydraulic heads monthly hydraulic heads were measured from 12 observation wells spanning the period from 2010 to 2014 these wells are distributed from the piedmont plains zone 2 to the oasis desert transition zone zone 4 and span depths from 28 and 256 m fig 3 and table 1 the hydraulic head generally declines from the south to the north following topography fig 4 in the piedmont plains zone 2 the hydraulic head ranges from 422 to 427 m asl figs 3 and 4 the minimal amount of variation in well m1 likely reflects high permeability unconfined gravel aquifers of the piedmont aquifers in the oasis plains zone 3 and oasis desert transition zone zone 4 the hydraulic heads range from 270 to 390 m asl fig 4 peak heads are observed from october to march whereas the lowest heads are observed from april to september the hydrographs within the oasis desert plains clearly show the impact of groundwater pumping during irrigation period the largest variation of hydraulic head observed in a single well was 48 m m11 this well is within the shallow aquifer variation of hydraulic heads in intermediate depth wells m7 m10 and m11 is larger than that in deep wells m8 and m9 suggesting k values may differ between aquifer of m7 m10 and m11 compared to m8 and m9 the intermediate groundwater is highly exploited for irrigation in the oasis desert transition zone zone 4 this depressurization of the intermediate depth aquifer may cause groundwater to leak from shallow and deep aquifers 4 2 spatial distribution of water chemistry surface water and groundwater chemistries are distinct from each other in the study area table s1 and table 2 the total dissolved solids tds of river water in the mountainous area zone 1 ranges from 209 to 392 mg l with mean value of 311 mg l n 5 the tds values of reservoir water in the oasis plains zone 3 range from 355 to 928 mg l with mean value of 605 mg l n 4 the dominant ions of river water are ca2 hco3 and so4 2 with the concentrations ranging from 1 9 to 2 9 meq l 1 2 to 2 3 meq l and 1 to 2 6 meq l respectively the reservoir water is characterized by na ca2 so4 2 and hco3 with the concentrations of 1 1 to 6 9 meq l 2 6 to 4 8 meq l 2 4 to 7 5 meq l and 1 7 to 3 5 meq l respectively most of surface water samples are characterized as ca so4 hco3 type with tds lower than 400 mg l fig 5 as shown in fig 6 groundwater chemistry is highly variable across the study area in the piedmont plains zone 2 the tds values of groundwater range from 231 to 2 798 mg l with mean value of 1 011 mg l n 9 groundwater chemistry is characterized by ca2 na so4 2 hco3 and cl with the concentrations ranging from 2 to 23 meq l for ca2 1 to 14 meq l for na 1 to 33 meq l for so4 2 1 to 9 meq l for hco3 and 0 to 20 meq l for cl respectively the no3 concentrations vary from 20 to 142 mg l mean concentration of 49 8 mg l with the exception of gw41 0 6 mg l and gw97 0 8 mg l in the oasis plains zone 3 the tds of shallow intermediate and deep groundwater ranges from 124 to 4 737 mg l 138 to 6 876 mg l and 140 to 2 300 mg l with average values of 1 450 n 12 1 127 n 20 and 408 mg l n 31 respectively in the oasis desert transition zone zone 4 groundwater has higher tds than that in the oasis plains with mean values of 1 665 mg l for shallow n 8 3 015 mg l for intermediate n 5 and 1 723 mg l for deep groundwater n 19 respectively in this zone the dominant ions are na cl and so4 2 for both intermediate and deep groundwater the mean concentrations of cl and so4 2 are 30 4 and 16 5 meq l for intermediate and 13 9 and 11 2 meq l for deep groundwater and the mean concentrations of na for intermediate and deep groundwater are 37 6 and 21 7 meq l respectively the mean no3 concentrations of shallow intermediate and deep groundwater are 37 2 17 3 and 4 8 mg l respectively in the terminal discharge area zone 5 groundwater has the highest tds with mean values of 5 539 mg l for shallow n 2 and 2 975 mg l for deep groundwater n 1 overall the groundwater chemistry in the oasis plains changes along the northwards flow path from na type with no dominant anions to na cl so4 type and eventually to na cl type in the terminal manas lake area in the desert zone 5 fig 5 4 3 stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes stable isotopes δ2h δ18o are effective tracers for determining the origin of groundwater recharge and its antecedent evaporation batlle aguilar et al 2017 mahlknetcht et al 2017 the stable isotopic compositions of precipitation surface water and groundwater taken from the mrb are shown in fig 7 relative to the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 the local meteoric water line lmwl δ2h 7 3 δ18o 4 3 is derived from urumqi station at an elevation of 918 m asl 150 km east of the mrb based on the mean monthly rainfall isotopic data during the period from 1986 to 2003 iaea 2006 stable isotope ratios for precipitation throughout the study area are not well documented only three rainfall samples r1 r2 and r3 were collected for stable isotope analysis for this study during summer 2016 the δ2h and δ18o ratios range from 71 to 45 and from 11 to 6 respectively table 2 the values of δ2h and δ18o for river water vary from 75 to 71 and from 12 to 10 respectively in contrast the δ2h and δ18o values for reservoir water are somewhat enriched over river water owing to evaporation varying from 70 to 64 and 11 to 9 respectively fig 7 the stable isotopic compositions of groundwater samples exhibit a wide range from 90 to 27 for δ2h and 13 to 4 for δ18o table 2 in the piedmont plains zone 2 the δ2h and δ18o values for groundwater vary from 90 to 68 and 13 to 9 respectively the shallow groundwater generally shows an enrichment trend from the piedmont plains zone 2 to the oasis desert transition zone zone 4 in the oasis plains zone 3 the average δ18o and δ2h values are 11 4 and 76 9 for intermediate groundwater and nearly identical in deep groundwater in the oasis desert plains zone 4 the average δ18o and δ2h values are 10 5 and 72 6 for intermediate groundwater and nearly identical in deep groundwater groundwater in the terminal discharge area zone 5 has the most depleted stable isotopes with δ2h and δ18o values ranging from 115 to 113 and 12 8 to 12 4 respectively 4 4 3h and a14c activities tritium 3h activities were measured for 11 groundwater samples in the study area table 3 the 3h activities of these groundwater samples range from 9 8 to 24 8 tu with the mean value of 13 8 tu in the oasis plains and oasis desert transition zone the 3h activities of shallow groundwater range from 10 3 to 24 8 tu with mean value of 15 6 tu and from 9 8 to 14 3 tu with mean value of 11 6 tu respectively the 14c activities and δ13c values of 24 groundwater samples range from 1 0 to 97 9 pmc for a14c and 13 5 to 3 6 for δ13c respectively fig 8 the 14c activity of groundwater in the piedmont plains is 72 1 pmc gw100 in this zone groundwater has a highly depleted δ13c value of 13 5 in the oasis plains zone 3 the 14c activities of intermediate and deep groundwater range from 1 0 to 50 8 pmc in the oasis desert transition zone zone 4 the 14c activities range from 1 0 to 73 1 pmc with lower a14c values 1 0 to 3 0 pmc and higher δ13c values 3 8 to 3 7 in wells greater than 260 m in depth in the final discharge area zone 5 the shallow groundwater has a14c value of 1 6 pmc but the deep groundwater has higher 14c activity than that of shallow groundwater indicating that groundwater flows upwards in this zone 4 5 the apparent 14c ages 14c activity is the most widely used method to trace groundwater with residence times up to 30 000 years old in regional aquifers clark and fritz 1997 cartwright 2010 li et al 2015 and determine recharge from mixture of waters under various climate conditions cook et al 2017 custodio et al 2018 however water samples collected from long screened wells are actually a mixture of waters with wide range of ages jasechko 2016 custodio et al 2018 lumped parameter models have been widely used to calculate groundwater residence times and quantify mixture of young and old groundwater but require users to assume constant flow and ascribe a known input age distribution jasechko 2016 unfortunately the distributions of true groundwater age are difficult or impossible to be determined since groundwater age is not a quantity that can be measured directly the distribution of groundwater age in a sample is unknown therefore we often refer to apparent ages that would be determined by the measured environmental tracers mccallum et al 2014 apparent 14c age is determined from 14c activity of dissolved inorganic carbon dic based on half life of 5 730 years this determination assumes an initial 14c activity of 100 pmc the calculation of apparent 14c age may be complicated if groundwater dic is derived from a mixture of sources however initial 14c activity originating from atmosphere or soil zone is significantly diluted by geochemical reactions such as dissolution of 14c free carbonate minerals exchange with aquifer matrix and biochemical reactions along the flow paths clark and fritz 1997 carbonate dissolution during recharge or along the flow paths may dilute the fraction of c derived from soil zone δ13c can be used to trace the mixing process clark and fritz 1997 while only minor carbonate dissolution likely occurs determination of groundwater residence times requires this to be taken into account atkinson et al 2014 the dilution factor q obtained from δ13c values is calculated by equation 1 1 q δ 13 c dic δ 13 c carb δ 13 c rech δ 13 c carb where δ13cdic is the measured δ13c activity of groundwater dic δ13creah is the initial δ13c activity of dic in recharge zones and δ13ccarb is the δ13c activity of carbonate in the aquifer matrix usually closed to 0 clark and fritz 1997 although the calculation of δ13creah requires the ph and temperature of recharge zone and the estimation of δ13c of the soil zone co2 it is similar to other studies in the northwest china the soil δ13c of co2 are around 23 in the area predominantly by c3 species allowing for isotopic fraction at the near neutral ph a δ13c value of 14 can be expected for dic li et al 2015 according to researches on the east junggar basin by li et al 2015 two δ13c values of the soil gas co2 was assumed for 14c age correction suggesting that recharge conditions with δ13c value of 13 4 was assumed for samples with higher a14c from 24 4 to 83 3 pmc and δ13c value of 10 4 for samples with a14c from 1 2 to 8 3 pmc in the mrb well gw100 which is located in the piedmont plains is selected as the representative sample to represent the initial recharge conditions δ13crech of 13 5 for relative higher a14c 30 98 pmc due to a decrease of 3 for δ13c value observed in the older groundwater li et al 2015 δ13crech of 10 5 was assumed for groundwater samples with a14c lower than 30 pmc in the study area based on the q values calculated from δ13c mixing model as shown in equation 1 groundwater 14c ages corrected for calcite dissolution are calculated by equation 2 2 t 8267 ln α 14 c q α 0 14 c where t is the 14c age a 0 14 c is the initial 14c activity assumed to be 100 pmc a 14 c is the measured 14c activity of groundwater dic and q is the radiocarbon dilution factor previous studies have concluded that 20 of the initial 14c activity has been diluted in baiyang basin 260 km northeast from the mrb northwest china edmunds et al 2006 huang et al 2017 therefore the initial 14c activity of 80 pmc are used for 14c ages correction in this study the corrected 14c ages within the mrb are shown in table 4 the corrected 14c age in the piedmont plains gw100 is 610 years whereas groundwater in this zone is considered as modern water as evident from 3h activities and stable isotopes tian et al 2010 ma et al 2019 this high 14c age may be caused by the impact of lateral recharge from the mountains in the oasis plains and oasis desert transition zone groundwater apparent 14c ages range from modern to 32 200 years along the flow paths in the final discharge area groundwater has the longest flow path with 14c ages between 23 000 and 32 500 with oldest groundwater in wells gw105 and gw106 5 discussion 5 1 groundwater origin and recharge sources as shown in fig 7 the surface water and groundwater samples in the study area plot close to the gmwl and the lmwl indicating a meteoric origin with little evaporation in the mrb the majority of precipitation occurs in the mountainous area zone 1 with limited precipitation and intense evapotranspiration in the oasis plains zone 3 and oasis desert transition zone zone 4 there is little recharge to aquifers surface water and groundwater in this basin mainly originated from meteoric water precipitation and glacial melting in the mountainous area the δ2h and δ18o values for precipitation in urumqi station gnip range from 147 to 35 and from 21 to 6 with weighted mean values of 74 7 and 10 9 respectively most of surface water and groundwater samples are depleted in the heavy isotopes relative to rainfall measured at urumqi station fig 7 these samples plot above the gmwl and lmwl suggesting the recharged water experienced the processes of vapor condensation in tianshan mountains huang and pang 2012 ma et al 2018 the mean δ2h and δ18o values of groundwater 76 2 and 11 1 in the piedmont plains zone 2 are very similar to that of river water 72 2 and 11 1 in the mountainous area zone 1 indicating that groundwater is recharged by infiltration of river water and lateral inflow from the mountains with little influence of evaporation the relatively high 3h concentrations 40 60 tu in the piedmont plains zone 2 indicate modern precipitation recharge ma et al 2019 with exception of well gw93 the δ2h and δ18o values of the shallow groundwater in the oasis plains zone 3 vary from 82 1 to 68 6 and 12 1 to 10 1 with mean values of 75 7 and 11 1 respectively the 3h concentrations of the shallow groundwater range from 10 3 to 24 8 tu with mean value of 15 6 tu the shallow groundwater in the oasis desert transition zone has relatively high heavy isotopic ratios compared to up gradient shallow groundwater indicating enrichment from irrigation return flow ma et al 2019 intermediate and deep groundwater in the oasis plains zone 3 and the oasis desert transition zone zone 4 have more depleted isotopic compositions likely driven by colder paleoclimates the groundwater in the terminal saline lake and salt playas zone 5 has the most negative values of δ2h and δ18o gw105 gw106 and gw107 and the 14c activities these samples are lower than 5 pmc this suggests that the groundwater in the terminal discharge area is recharged from ancient water under colder climatic conditions ma et al 2018 5 2 mechanisms controlling groundwater chemistry generally the composition of natural groundwater is primarily impacted by the initial composition of the recharge water and water rock interactions which interact with groundwater residence times along the flow paths na cl molar ratio mna cl is useful to characterize water rock interactions in arid regions cl mainly originates from halite dissolution in evaporite deposits with mna cl of 1 however in the aquifers of the mrb the mna cl is higher than 1 fig 6a the excess na relative to cl suggests that silicate weathering i e feldspar or ion exchange may occur in the study area liu et al 2006 zhu et al 2017 ma et al 2018 reported that silicate weathering is not a crucial process that contributes na to groundwater in the mrb based on observed low molar ratios of si na cl average ratio of 0 27 an excess of hco3 so4 2 relative to ca2 mg2 indicates that the processes of dissolution calcite dolomite and gypsum and ion exchange between ca2 or mg2 in groundwater and na in aquifer minerals may occur along the flow paths fig 6b saturation indices si for calcite and gypsum were calculated using phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 the si for calcite lies above and below zero indicating interactions with carbonate minerals along flow paths fig 9 a specially most of the water samples in the mountains zone 1 and piedmont plains zone 2 have negative si values for calcite but positive values in the oasis plains zone 3 and oasis desert transition zone zone 4 this indicates that carbonate dissolution occurs in the mountains and piedmont plains but precipitates in oasis plains and oasis desert transition zone all water samples have negative si values for gypsum indicating the under saturation of gypsum along the groundwater flow paths fig 9b the molar concentrations of ca2 and mg2 in excess of hco3 fig 9c and so4 2 in excess of ca2 fig 9d suggests that groundwater chemistry is impacted by calcite precipitation reverse ion exchange and evapotranspiration effect liu et al 2018 the plot of ca2 mg2 so4 2 hco3 against na cl fig 10 a is useful to evaluate the possible role of ion exchange in the groundwater chemical compositions ma et al 2014 wang et al 2015 if the relationship between these two composite parameters is linear with a slope of 1 ion exchange likely controls the concentrations of these cations the slopes of deep groundwater samples in the oasis plains zone 3 and the oasis desert plains zone 4 are closed to 1 indicating that the chemistry of deep groundwater in these two zones is impacted by ion exchange the positive or negative ion exchange processes can be determined by the chloro alkaline indices cai cai 1 is defined by the ratio of cl na k to cl cai 2 is defined by the ratio of cl na k to hco3 so4 2 no3 a positive value indicates that ion exchange occurs between na in groundwater and ca2 or mg2 within aquifer minerals in contrast a negative value indicates that ion exchange takes place between ca2 or mg2 in the groundwater and na attached to exchange sites on minerals namely reverse ion change wang et al 2015 zhu et al 2017 the cai 1 and cai 2 are below zero for almost all groundwater samples with the exception of gw36 gw47 and gw64 fig 10b this indicates that na is released through the process of reverse ion exchange in the deep groundwater along the flow paths anthropogenic activities such as reservoir construction over exploitation and agricultural cultivations may be influencing groundwater chemistry in the mrb these activities may change the groundwater recharge and discharge and have a complex effect on groundwater geochemistry in the piedmont plains the high no3 concentrations mean concentration of 49 8 mg l indicate that fertilizer are used in the agricultural fields and the applied nutrients can leach through the surface to the groundwater through highly permeable pebbles and gravel deposits in this zone in the oasis plain and oasis desert transition zone agricultural activities impact shallow groundwater chemistry in this zone in the mrb the irrigation return flow and channel leakage account for 42 of total recharge water liu et al 2018 the high concentration of na cl so4 2 and hco3 of shallow groundwater in the oasis plains and oasis desert transition zone suggests that the dissolution of mirabilite na2so4 10h2o halite and trona na2co3 nahco3 2h2o in soil is the dominant processes that impact groundwater chemistry during irrigation water infiltration han et al 2011 xiao et al 2018 5 3 groundwater recharge and mixing features 5 3 1 chloride and stable isotopic indications as one of the largest irrigation areas in xinjiang agriculture is highly developed in the mrb groundwater exploitation for irrigation has changed the hydraulic gradients resulting in groundwater flowing from one aquifer unit or flow path to another in other aquifer systems these changes have been observed to cause mixing of groundwater from different formations changing the chemistry of the well water in important ways ayotte et al 2011 the relationship of δ18o values and cl concentrations has been widely used to determine recharge sources and groundwater mixing features négrel et al 2011 in this study the δ18o values of most groundwater samples fall into a relatively narrow range of 13 to 7 but have a very wide range of cl concentrations table s1 compared to isotopic compositions of precipitation in urumqi station the δ2h and δ18o values exhibit a narrow range from 90 to 50 and 13 to 7 respectively reflecting groundwater mixing along the groundwater flow direction under the hydrologic cycle goller et al 2005 the mixing effect commonly results in the homogeneous stable isotopic variations with the depth and along the groundwater flow paths this phenomenon has also been documented in datong basin of north china xie et al 2012 murry basin of australia cartwright and weaver 2005 and tropical montane forest of south ecuador goller et al 2005 generally the groundwater isotopic compositions δ2h and δ18o remain stable and the 14c activity decreases along the flow paths liang et al 2015 in this study the δ2h and δ18o values are similar across well depth and groundwater flow paths and 14c activity of the deep groundwater gradually decreases in the piedmont plains and the oasis plains indicating that the recharge waters have the same origin and lateral mixing occurs in the study area fig 11 a in the piedmont plains cl concentrations of groundwater range from 101 to 153 mg l and δ18o values range from 13 to 9 the relationship between cl and δ18o indicates that vertical infiltration and lateral mixing are significant in the piedmont plains due to high permeability of the gravel and sand gravel formations groundwater renewal rates are high and residence times are young 30 to 180 years however this situation changes in the downstream of the mrb in the oasis desert transition zone cl concentrations of groundwater samples increase from 17 to 3 780 mg l with relatively constant δ18o values mean value of 12 2 high variation of cl concentrations may be caused by vertical mixing among the aquifers and dissolution of soil minerals where irrigation return occurs 5 3 2 3h and 14c indications tritium 3h activities have been widely used to identify modern precipitation recharge with a half life of 12 32 years mahlknetcht et al 2017 the 3h activity of precipitation in urumqi station was reconstructed from the available data from the international atomic energy agency iaea during the period of 1953 and 2003 fig 12 this curve shows that 3h concentrations in precipitation have decreased since the 1960s and the estimated 3h concentration has since stabilized around 10 tu the mean 3h concentration of shallow groundwater is 15 6 tu in the oasis plains and 11 6 tu in the oasis desert transition zone this suggests the presence of post 1950s recharge which is consistent with the estimated age of 50 180 years assuming piston flow and mixing models tian et al 2010 ma et al 2019 reported that the 3h concentrations of groundwater in the piedmont plains ranged from 40 to 60 tu which indicates that groundwater in this zone is recharged from the vertical infiltration of modern surface water and precipitation with short flow paths 14c activities have been used for determination of groundwater paleo meteoric recharge centuries to millennia and groundwater mixing custodio et al 2018 due to limited recharge from precipitation and surface water in the oasis desert transition zone intensive pumping from long screened wells for agricultural irrigation increases the advection of shallow water into deep aquifer and causes mixture of groundwater chemistry edmunds 2001 knappett et al 2017 generally groundwater residence times increase away from the recharge area along the flow paths atkinson et al 2014 as shown in fig 12b the 14c activities of gw3 depth of 40 m and gw2 depth of 120 m are 97 9 pmc and 73 1 pmc and the isotopic compositions of these two samples are enriched with the values of 55 8 and 56 2 for δ2h and 7 6 and 7 6 for δ18o respectively this suggests the presence of modern water and the recharged water experienced the processes of evapotranspiration in the oasis desert transition zone most of groundwater samples in this zone have higher 14c activities 8 6 73 1 pmc than that in the oasis plains 1 0 3 5 pmc the isotopic compositions of groundwater samples gw13 gw22 gw23 and gw25 are enriched with the values of 65 to 54 for δ2h and 10 to 7 for δ18o the 14c activities among these four samples are between 16 and 18 pmc fig 11b which are higher than that in the groundwater at wells gw5 depth of 260 m and gw15 depth of 300 m in this zone long groundwater flow paths with high 14c activities is caused by vertical mixing between young and much older groundwater owing to pumping with long well screens 5 4 groundwater flow patterns the groundwater flow systems can be referred as local if recharge and discharge areas are contiguous intermediate if these areas are separated by one or more local systems and regional if they extend over the full extent of the basin toth 2009 liang et al 2015 we developed a conceptual hydrogeological model based on the geological and hydrogeological information groundwater levels hydrogeochemical and isotopic data from surface water and groundwater under intensive agricultural activities fig 13 the glacial melting and precipitation in the tianshan mountains supply surface water flows the infiltration of these surface waters in the mountainous areas comprises the main source of groundwater recharge in the piedmont plains the groundwater is characterized by the type of ca hco3 so4 with tds of 300 mg l which is primarily generated through dissolution of calcite and gypsum in this area local groundwater flow systems contain modern groundwater in shallow aquifers within the oasis plains and oasis desert transition zone irrigation water and evaporation are considered as recharge source and groundwater discharge respectively indicating local flow systems operates the shallow groundwater is characterized by the type of na so4 hco3 with tritium concentration of 13 1 tu which is consistent with the groundwater residence times of 50 180 years tian et al 2010 the intermediate flow systems mainly operate in the lowlands zones 3 4 and 5 below the local flow system the groundwater is recharged by the lateral subsurface flow from the piedmont plains and river water infiltration and discharges to evapotranspiration and pumping aquifers in the piedmont plains have higher renewal rates owing to the high permeability of the gravel formations compared to that in the oasis plains and oasis desert transition zone aquifers in the piedmont plains have relatively low renewal rates as a result of lithology dominated by fine sand with groundwater residence times of 5 000 to 10 000 years the dominant processes that impact groundwater geochemistry are mineral dissolution reverse ion exchange and precipitation the intermediate groundwater in the oasis desert transition zone is characterized by the na cl so4 type with high tds of 7 280 mg l moreover the no3 concentrations are higher than 50 mg l indicating that anthropogenic activities such as groundwater pumping and irrigation return flow impact and vertical mixing of groundwater systems occur in this region wang et al 2019 the regional flow systems occur under the intermediate flow system and are recharged from precipitation and glacial melting surface water infiltration within the mountainous area and discharged at oasis plains into terminal manas lake resulting in evaporation aquifers of these systems have much lower renewal rates with groundwater residence times up to 35 000 years groundwater geochemistry is dominantly impacted by water rock interaction and also impacted by evaporation within the terminal discharge area this flow system contains groundwater residence times between 9 000 and 35 000 years in the deep aquifers across the study area with the groundwater residence times older than 25 000 years from wells with greater than 300 m deep the groundwater chemistry varies from ca hco3 so4 type in the piedmont plains to na cl so4 type in manas lake with increasing concentrations of cl and tds along the entire flow paths in the manas river basin 6 conclusion in this study hydrochemistry and environmental isotopes are integrated to characterize groundwater flow systems under the influence of agricultural activities in the manas river basin northwest china groundwater originates from glacier melting and precipitation in the mountains area and the surface water leakages in the mountain front plain or piedmont plains are the main recharge source for groundwater in quaternary unconsolidated materials three hierarchy flow system patterns local intermediate and regional are identified in the mrb local groundwater flow systems contain modern water in the piedmont plains and also operate in the shallow aquifers within the oasis plains and oasis desert transition zone with irrigation water providing a highly evaporated recharge the regional flow systems underlie intermediate flow systems these flow systems contain groundwater 14c ages between 9 000 and 35 000 years in the deep aquifers across the basin with the groundwater residence times older than 25 000 years from wells greater than 300 m deep groundwater chemistry presents an evolutionary trend from ca hco3 so4 type in high topographic areas to na cl type in the lower topographic areas which is a common pattern of hydrogeochemical evolution in arid inland river basin herczeg and edmunds 2000 in arid inland river basins intensive pumping from long screened wells for irrigated agriculture has changed the hydraulic gradients leading to the mixture of modern and much older groundwater in the multi aquifer systems vertical recharge and lateral mixing occur in the piedmont plains and vertical mixing occurs in the oasis desert transition zone and desert as evidence from environmental tracers these mixing processes pose difficulties in characterization of groundwater flow systems pumping induced mixture between young and much older groundwater in the mrb are similar to the minqin basin edmunds et al 2006 dunhuang basin ma et al 2013 east junggar basin li et al 2015 in northwest china and murray basin in australia cartwright 2010 cartwright et al 2010 this insight and approaches can help understanding human impacted groundwater flow systems in the mrb northwest china and other similar semi arid to arid inland basins around the world furthermore the calculation of mixing fraction of young and much older groundwater and the accurate determination of groundwater residence times are significant for better understanding groundwater flow systems in

4801,the impacts of long term pumping on groundwater flow patterns and groundwater chemistry are unclear in the manas river basin an arid inland basin in northwest china in this study hydraulic heads hydrochemistry and environmental isotopic tracers were analyzed to reveal groundwater flow patterns recharge sources and deduce hydrogeochemical processes in this highly exploited aquifer system spatial trends in the isotopic ratios δ18o and δ2h indicate that groundwater originates from glacial melting and precipitation in the mountainous area in the piedmont plains dissolution of calcite gypsum and dolomite yields a groundwater type dominated by ca hco3 so4 with tds of 300 mg l in this area high 3h concentrations demarcate local flow systems and imply modern precipitation recharge downgradient in the lowlands irrigation return flow recharges shallow groundwater through local flow paths groundwater pumping has intensified vertical hydraulic gradients causing vertical mixing between aquifers generally across the basin regional flow systems contain groundwater with 14c ages ranging from modern to 33 000 years with the oldest waters found in wells with depths greater than 200 m from high to low elevation groundwater chemistry transitions from ca hco3 so4 to na cl so4 type as concentrations of cl and overall tds increase the replacement of ca2 with na as the dominant cation suggests reverse ion exchange and carbonate precipitation occur along the intermediate and regional flow paths anthropogenic activities i e pumping irrigation return flow application of fertilizers impact shallow groundwater chemistry 60 m this research reveals the impacts of natural and human induced hydrogeochemical processes impacting groundwater chemistry in this basin with implications for similar semi arid to arid inter montane basins around the world keywords groundwater flow patterns hydrogeochemistry environmental isotopes manas river basin northwest china 1 introduction water scarcity commonly resulting in water use conflicts has become a great concern in the management of river basins especially in arid and semi arid regions around the world white et al 2014 in these basins massive quantities of stored groundwater play a vital role in sustaining human and ecological systems increasing water demands to satisfy rapid growth in agriculture to provide food for mostly urban populations as well as industrial growth have greatly increased groundwater exploitation leading to permanent water table declines grogan et al 2015 joshi et al 2018 large scale groundwater exploitation has caused many eco environmental problems these include land subsidence groundwater quality degradation reduction in baseflow to rivers and springs resulting in their seasonal or even permanent disappearance and negative impacts on baseflow dependent ecosystems fishman et al 2011 kurunc et al 2016 tweed et al 2018 therefore the sustainable utilization of groundwater resources in agricultural regions in arid inland basins is a challenge that will demand coordinated policy responses to achieve desirable social economic and ecological outcomes worldwide hoogesteger and wester 2017 villholth et al 2018 understanding the various groundwater flow pathways from recharge to discharge is critical for sustainable utilization of groundwater resources and maintaining ecosystems in arid inland basins according to toth 1963 groundwater flow systems can be divided into three types local intermediate and regional hydrogeologists commonly demarcate these flow systems through analysis of topography and by considering the three dimensional structure of the geological layers and their hydraulic properties most important being hydraulic conductivity k groundwater velocities flow path residence times and chemical compositions vary with mineralogical composition hydraulic properties land topography and the scale of the aquifer system brkic et al 2016 in recent decades hydrogeochemical and isotopic data have been applied to locate and quantify aquifer recharge discharge and surface water runoff furthermore isotopes and chemistry have been used to identify the hydraulic connection within and between aquifers and demarcate groundwater flow paths han et al 2009 2010 hatipoglu et al 2009 bretzler et al 2011 pavlovskiy and selle 2015 sun et al 2016 woldmariyam and ayenew 2016 kagabu et al 2017 joshi et al 2018 however in irrigated regions screened intervals of production wells are typically long spanning tens to hundreds of meters to yield the largest amount of groundwater during irrigation period intensive pumping from long screened production wells causes the downward advection of shallow aquifer water into deep aquifer leading to mixtures in groundwater residence times and chemistry edmunds 2001 ayotte et al 2011 knappett et al 2017 the mixture of modern water and much older groundwater occur as evident in samples collected from globally distributed and diverse aquifers jasechko 2016 jasechko et al 2017 these mixing processes between water of different ages within the aquifer pose difficulties for estimation of residence times using environmental tracer ma et al 2019 due to the complexity of groundwater systems in arid inland basins where the groundwater is pumped for irrigated agriculture the systematic understanding of groundwater flow systems is still inadequate villholth et al 2018 specifically the impacts of intensive groundwater pumping on groundwater flow patterns and groundwater geochemistry are under studied this limits scientist s ability to predict the impacts of intense groundwater pumping on the region s ecosystems e g land subsidence reduction in the base flow of springs and rivers saltwater intrusion damage to aquatic ecosystems the manas river basin mrb is located in northwest china it is typical of mountain oasis desert inland river basins in which the natural pre development low lying discharge area is occupied by saline lake manas lake salt playas and salt crusts the present day oases which are no longer fed by artesian springs but rather created by damming of streams are surrounded by cultivated land urban and residential land and gardens liu et al 2010a 2010b zhang et al 2012a ling et al 2013 numerous surface water reservoirs have been built within the mrb in the past fifty years to supply the growing local population and agriculture cheng et al 2006 ling et al 2011 the surface area of these reservoirs increased from 336 to 6 590 km2 between 1949 and 2010 while the population increased from 55 600 to 1 120 000 ling et al 2012 zhang et al 2012b rapid population and agricultural growth have been achieved through the extraction of approximately 7 3 108 m3 of groundwater during the past fifty years a study by ling et al 2010 estimated that a staggering 58 of the stored fresh groundwater has already been extracted there are over 10 000 long screened production wells in the mrb long well screens allow cross formational flow which may increase the downward advection of shallow brackish groundwater mayo 2010 ayotte et al 2011 izbicki et al 2015 this brackish water formed by thousands of years of upward groundwater discharge combined with evaporation the result is playa lakes such as the highly saline manas lake tds 385 720 mg l liu et al 2018 intensive pumping from these long screened wells has caused the water table to decline by 10 60 m in various locations since the 1960s chen et al 2009 pumping from the deep aquifers 180 m increased the vertical hydraulic gradients reversing the natural flow direction from upward to downward and causing the groundwater to leak from upper shallow aquifers to deep aquifers this is likely driving changes to groundwater flow systems in the past sixty years chen et al 2009 however the specific impacts of pumping on groundwater flow patterns and the resulting changes to groundwater geochemistry are unclear the main objective of this study is to characterize the groundwater flow systems within intensively pumped aquifers through an integrated analysis of major ion chemistry stable isotopes 2h 18o and radio isotopes 3h and 14c in the mrb the specific aims are to identify groundwater recharge sources determine the controlling mechanisms on groundwater geochemistry analyze groundwater mixing characteristics and delineate groundwater flow patterns this research enhances our understanding of natural and human impacted groundwater flow systems not only in the mrb northwest china but in similar semi arid to arid inland basins around the world 2 study area 2 1 location and climate the manas river basin is located in the southern part of the junggar basin xinjiang province fig 1 it lies between latitudes 43 05 to 45 58 n and longitudes 84 42 to 86 35 e with an area of 17 600 km2 stretching from the taxi river in the east to the bayingou river in the west and from tianshan mountains in the south to manas lake in the north the volumetric flux of surface runoff from the mountains is dominated by five stream systems with an average flux of 2 0 109 m3 a ling et al 2010 2012 the five stream systems are bayingou river jingou river ningjia river manas river and taxi river in order from west to east as the largest inland river north of the tianshan mountains the manas river originates from the permanent glaciated terrain located over 5 000 m above sea level m asl and flows through gurbantunggut desert with a total length of 400 km and annual runoff volume of 12 108 m3 a shi et al 2010 the mrb has a continental arid climate characterized by hot dry summers and cold winters cheng et al 2006 the mean annual air temperature is 5 9 6 6 and 6 8 c in the piedmont plains oasis plains and oasis desert transition zone respectively for the same respective zones the mean annual precipitation varies from 190 to 630 150 to 200 and 110 to 140 mm and the average annual pan evaporation in the three respective zones is 1 100 1 800 1 500 2 400 and 1 700 2 500 mm ling et al 2013 zhao 2013 in the mrb 60 80 of the precipitation occurs during the period of june to august and the evaporation is far greater than the precipitation during the whole year cheng et al 2006 2 2 geological and hydrogeological settings the mrb is divided into five geomorphic units mountainous areas zone 1 piedmont plains zone 2 oasis plains zone 3 oasis desert transition zone zone 4 and deserts zone 5 fig 1b in order from the maximum elevation of 5 243 m asl in the mountains to a low of 256 m asl in northern terminal manas lake cheng et al 2006 the mountains and the plains are comprised of unconsolidated sediments which were deposited during the early and middle yanshanian and late himalaya periods shi et al 2004 the mesozoic strata in the basin are mainly distributed in the mountainous areas whereas the piedmont and oasis plains are comprised of cenozoic strata including neogene and quaternary deposits fig 2 bedrock sandy conglomerate clay and siltstone are widely distributed throughout the basin in the mountainous areas the aquifers are composed of granites sedimentary formation of devonian and carboniferous age and mesozoic limestone shi et al 2004 in the piedmont plains the phreatic aquifer is comprised of gravel and sand gravel of quaternary age currently the water table lies more than 50 m below land surface and hydraulic conductivity k ranges from 80 to 130 m d liu et al 2006 2010a 2010b in the oasis plains and oasis desert transition zone the coarse phreatic aquifer transitions to a multilayer structured system of unconfined and confined aquifers and aquitards the aquitards are comprised of sandy clay and clay aquifer k values range from 7 to 37 m d liu et al 2006 2010a 2010b generally groundwater in the mrb originates from the mountainous area and flows horizontally from the piedmont to the lowlands and finally into manas lake which represents the terminal discharge area under natural conditions owing to human activities reservoir construction efforts of minimize channel seepage groundwater exploitation the natural flow systems have been changed chen et al 2009 this resulted in a decrease of artesian spring flow cones of depression at the margins of the deserts and groundwater leakage from shallow to deep aquifers the main sources of groundwater recharge are vertical infiltration from rivers lateral subsurface flow from the piedmont zone and irrigation return flow in the lowlands the main discharge mechanisms are pumping springs and evapotranspiration 3 materials and methods water samples were collected between april and september 2016 including 9 surface water river and reservoir samples 3 rainfall samples and 107 groundwater samples fig 3 rainfall samples were collected in the piedmont plains oasis plains and oasis desert transition zone river water samples were obtained from the upper reach of manas river in the mountains reservoir water was sampled at the shore groundwater samples were collected from production wells spanning depths from 18 to 420 m across the study area these wells fell into three groups based on depth shallow 60 m intermediate 60 to 180 m and deep 180 m as most production wells are actively pumped for irrigation and domestic water demands these wells were constructed with long screened intervals to maximize yields the screen lengths range from 80 to 250 m below the ground surface yang et al 2017 and the water table occurs within the screen intervals in many cases during sampling field parameters such as electrical conductivity ec temperature t and ph were measured in situ using hach 40d instruments hach inc loveland colorado united states the concentrations of co3 2 and hco3 were determined by the titration method with 0 05 n hcl all water samples for major ion analysis were filtered through 0 45 μm millipore syringe filters and stored in 50 ml polyethylene plastic bottles water samples collected for cation analysis were acidified with ultrapure hno3 to ph 2 whereas samples for anion analysis were left unacidified concentrations of

finnigan mat 253 thermo fisher scientific inc ma united states based on temperature conversion elemental analysis tc ea method the results were reported in δ notation as per mil with respect to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow the analytical precision for δ2h and δ18o were 0 5 and 0 1 respectively all the water samples for major chemical compositions and stable isotopes were measured at china university of geoscience wuhan china water samples for measurement of tritium and radiocarbon contents were collected in 500 ml polyethylene bottles tritium 3h was determined on electrolytically enriched water samples by using liquid scintillation spectrometry 1220 quantulus ultra low level counters perkinelmer waltham ma usa at china university of geosciences wuhan china the

hydraulic heads monthly hydraulic heads were measured from 12 observation wells spanning the period from 2010 to 2014 these wells are distributed from the piedmont plains zone 2 to the oasis desert transition zone zone 4 and span depths from 28 and 256 m fig 3 and table 1 the hydraulic head generally declines from the south to the north following topography fig 4 in the piedmont plains zone 2 the hydraulic head ranges from 422 to 427 m asl figs 3 and 4 the minimal amount of variation in well m1 likely reflects high permeability unconfined gravel aquifers of the piedmont aquifers in the oasis plains zone 3 and oasis desert transition zone zone 4 the hydraulic heads range from 270 to 390 m asl fig 4 peak heads are observed from october to march whereas the lowest heads are observed from april to september the hydrographs within the oasis desert plains clearly show the impact of groundwater pumping during irrigation period the largest variation of hydraulic head observed in a single well was 48 m m11 this well is within the shallow aquifer variation of hydraulic heads in intermediate depth wells m7 m10 and m11 is larger than that in deep wells m8 and m9 suggesting k values may differ between aquifer of m7 m10 and m11 compared to m8 and m9 the intermediate groundwater is highly exploited for irrigation in the oasis desert transition zone zone 4 this depressurization of the intermediate depth aquifer may cause groundwater to leak from shallow and deep aquifers 4 2 spatial distribution of water chemistry surface water and groundwater chemistries are distinct from each other in the study area table s1 and table 2 the total dissolved solids tds of river water in the mountainous area zone 1 ranges from 209 to 392 mg l with mean value of 311 mg l n 5 the tds values of reservoir water in the oasis plains zone 3 range from 355 to 928 mg l with mean value of 605 mg l n 4 the dominant ions of river water are ca2 hco3 and so4 2 with the concentrations ranging from 1 9 to 2 9 meq l 1 2 to 2 3 meq l and 1 to 2 6 meq l respectively the reservoir water is characterized by na ca2 so4 2 and hco3 with the concentrations of 1 1 to 6 9 meq l 2 6 to 4 8 meq l 2 4 to 7 5 meq l and 1 7 to 3 5 meq l respectively most of surface water samples are characterized as ca so4 hco3 type with tds lower than 400 mg l fig 5 as shown in fig 6 groundwater chemistry is highly variable across the study area in the piedmont plains zone 2 the tds values of groundwater range from 231 to 2 798 mg l with mean value of 1 011 mg l n 9 groundwater chemistry is characterized by ca2 na so4 2 hco3 and cl with the concentrations ranging from 2 to 23 meq l for ca2 1 to 14 meq l for na 1 to 33 meq l for so4 2 1 to 9 meq l for hco3 and 0 to 20 meq l for cl respectively the no3 concentrations vary from 20 to 142 mg l mean concentration of 49 8 mg l with the exception of gw41 0 6 mg l and gw97 0 8 mg l in the oasis plains zone 3 the tds of shallow intermediate and deep groundwater ranges from 124 to 4 737 mg l 138 to 6 876 mg l and 140 to 2 300 mg l with average values of 1 450 n 12 1 127 n 20 and 408 mg l n 31 respectively in the oasis desert transition zone zone 4 groundwater has higher tds than that in the oasis plains with mean values of 1 665 mg l for shallow n 8 3 015 mg l for intermediate n 5 and 1 723 mg l for deep groundwater n 19 respectively in this zone the dominant ions are na cl and so4 2 for both intermediate and deep groundwater the mean concentrations of cl and so4 2 are 30 4 and 16 5 meq l for intermediate and 13 9 and 11 2 meq l for deep groundwater and the mean concentrations of na for intermediate and deep groundwater are 37 6 and 21 7 meq l respectively the mean no3 concentrations of shallow intermediate and deep groundwater are 37 2 17 3 and 4 8 mg l respectively in the terminal discharge area zone 5 groundwater has the highest tds with mean values of 5 539 mg l for shallow n 2 and 2 975 mg l for deep groundwater n 1 overall the groundwater chemistry in the oasis plains changes along the northwards flow path from na type with no dominant anions to na cl so4 type and eventually to na cl type in the terminal manas lake area in the desert zone 5 fig 5 4 3 stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes stable isotopes δ2h δ18o are effective tracers for determining the origin of groundwater recharge and its antecedent evaporation batlle aguilar et al 2017 mahlknetcht et al 2017 the stable isotopic compositions of precipitation surface water and groundwater taken from the mrb are shown in fig 7 relative to the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 the local meteoric water line lmwl δ2h 7 3 δ18o 4 3 is derived from urumqi station at an elevation of 918 m asl 150 km east of the mrb based on the mean monthly rainfall isotopic data during the period from 1986 to 2003 iaea 2006 stable isotope ratios for precipitation throughout the study area are not well documented only three rainfall samples r1 r2 and r3 were collected for stable isotope analysis for this study during summer 2016 the δ2h and δ18o ratios range from 71 to 45 and from 11 to 6 respectively table 2 the values of δ2h and δ18o for river water vary from 75 to 71 and from 12 to 10 respectively in contrast the δ2h and δ18o values for reservoir water are somewhat enriched over river water owing to evaporation varying from 70 to 64 and 11 to 9 respectively fig 7 the stable isotopic compositions of groundwater samples exhibit a wide range from 90 to 27 for δ2h and 13 to 4 for δ18o table 2 in the piedmont plains zone 2 the δ2h and δ18o values for groundwater vary from 90 to 68 and 13 to 9 respectively the shallow groundwater generally shows an enrichment trend from the piedmont plains zone 2 to the oasis desert transition zone zone 4 in the oasis plains zone 3 the average δ18o and δ2h values are 11 4 and 76 9 for intermediate groundwater and nearly identical in deep groundwater in the oasis desert plains zone 4 the average δ18o and δ2h values are 10 5 and 72 6 for intermediate groundwater and nearly identical in deep groundwater groundwater in the terminal discharge area zone 5 has the most depleted stable isotopes with δ2h and δ18o values ranging from 115 to 113 and 12 8 to 12 4 respectively 4 4 3h and a14c activities tritium 3h activities were measured for 11 groundwater samples in the study area table 3 the 3h activities of these groundwater samples range from 9 8 to 24 8 tu with the mean value of 13 8 tu in the oasis plains and oasis desert transition zone the 3h activities of shallow groundwater range from 10 3 to 24 8 tu with mean value of 15 6 tu and from 9 8 to 14 3 tu with mean value of 11 6 tu respectively the 14c activities and δ13c values of 24 groundwater samples range from 1 0 to 97 9 pmc for a14c and 13 5 to 3 6 for δ13c respectively fig 8 the 14c activity of groundwater in the piedmont plains is 72 1 pmc gw100 in this zone groundwater has a highly depleted δ13c value of 13 5 in the oasis plains zone 3 the 14c activities of intermediate and deep groundwater range from 1 0 to 50 8 pmc in the oasis desert transition zone zone 4 the 14c activities range from 1 0 to 73 1 pmc with lower a14c values 1 0 to 3 0 pmc and higher δ13c values 3 8 to 3 7 in wells greater than 260 m in depth in the final discharge area zone 5 the shallow groundwater has a14c value of 1 6 pmc but the deep groundwater has higher 14c activity than that of shallow groundwater indicating that groundwater flows upwards in this zone 4 5 the apparent 14c ages 14c activity is the most widely used method to trace groundwater with residence times up to 30 000 years old in regional aquifers clark and fritz 1997 cartwright 2010 li et al 2015 and determine recharge from mixture of waters under various climate conditions cook et al 2017 custodio et al 2018 however water samples collected from long screened wells are actually a mixture of waters with wide range of ages jasechko 2016 custodio et al 2018 lumped parameter models have been widely used to calculate groundwater residence times and quantify mixture of young and old groundwater but require users to assume constant flow and ascribe a known input age distribution jasechko 2016 unfortunately the distributions of true groundwater age are difficult or impossible to be determined since groundwater age is not a quantity that can be measured directly the distribution of groundwater age in a sample is unknown therefore we often refer to apparent ages that would be determined by the measured environmental tracers mccallum et al 2014 apparent 14c age is determined from 14c activity of dissolved inorganic carbon dic based on half life of 5 730 years this determination assumes an initial 14c activity of 100 pmc the calculation of apparent 14c age may be complicated if groundwater dic is derived from a mixture of sources however initial 14c activity originating from atmosphere or soil zone is significantly diluted by geochemical reactions such as dissolution of 14c free carbonate minerals exchange with aquifer matrix and biochemical reactions along the flow paths clark and fritz 1997 carbonate dissolution during recharge or along the flow paths may dilute the fraction of c derived from soil zone δ13c can be used to trace the mixing process clark and fritz 1997 while only minor carbonate dissolution likely occurs determination of groundwater residence times requires this to be taken into account atkinson et al 2014 the dilution factor q obtained from δ13c values is calculated by equation 1 1 q δ 13 c dic δ 13 c carb δ 13 c rech δ 13 c carb where δ13cdic is the measured δ13c activity of groundwater dic δ13creah is the initial δ13c activity of dic in recharge zones and δ13ccarb is the δ13c activity of carbonate in the aquifer matrix usually closed to 0 clark and fritz 1997 although the calculation of δ13creah requires the ph and temperature of recharge zone and the estimation of δ13c of the soil zone co2 it is similar to other studies in the northwest china the soil δ13c of co2 are around 23 in the area predominantly by c3 species allowing for isotopic fraction at the near neutral ph a δ13c value of 14 can be expected for dic li et al 2015 according to researches on the east junggar basin by li et al 2015 two δ13c values of the soil gas co2 was assumed for 14c age correction suggesting that recharge conditions with δ13c value of 13 4 was assumed for samples with higher a14c from 24 4 to 83 3 pmc and δ13c value of 10 4 for samples with a14c from 1 2 to 8 3 pmc in the mrb well gw100 which is located in the piedmont plains is selected as the representative sample to represent the initial recharge conditions δ13crech of 13 5 for relative higher a14c 30 98 pmc due to a decrease of 3 for δ13c value observed in the older groundwater li et al 2015 δ13crech of 10 5 was assumed for groundwater samples with a14c lower than 30 pmc in the study area based on the q values calculated from δ13c mixing model as shown in equation 1 groundwater 14c ages corrected for calcite dissolution are calculated by equation 2 2 t 8267 ln α 14 c q α 0 14 c where t is the 14c age a 0 14 c is the initial 14c activity assumed to be 100 pmc a 14 c is the measured 14c activity of groundwater dic and q is the radiocarbon dilution factor previous studies have concluded that 20 of the initial 14c activity has been diluted in baiyang basin 260 km northeast from the mrb northwest china edmunds et al 2006 huang et al 2017 therefore the initial 14c activity of 80 pmc are used for 14c ages correction in this study the corrected 14c ages within the mrb are shown in table 4 the corrected 14c age in the piedmont plains gw100 is 610 years whereas groundwater in this zone is considered as modern water as evident from 3h activities and stable isotopes tian et al 2010 ma et al 2019 this high 14c age may be caused by the impact of lateral recharge from the mountains in the oasis plains and oasis desert transition zone groundwater apparent 14c ages range from modern to 32 200 years along the flow paths in the final discharge area groundwater has the longest flow path with 14c ages between 23 000 and 32 500 with oldest groundwater in wells gw105 and gw106 5 discussion 5 1 groundwater origin and recharge sources as shown in fig 7 the surface water and groundwater samples in the study area plot close to the gmwl and the lmwl indicating a meteoric origin with little evaporation in the mrb the majority of precipitation occurs in the mountainous area zone 1 with limited precipitation and intense evapotranspiration in the oasis plains zone 3 and oasis desert transition zone zone 4 there is little recharge to aquifers surface water and groundwater in this basin mainly originated from meteoric water precipitation and glacial melting in the mountainous area the δ2h and δ18o values for precipitation in urumqi station gnip range from 147 to 35 and from 21 to 6 with weighted mean values of 74 7 and 10 9 respectively most of surface water and groundwater samples are depleted in the heavy isotopes relative to rainfall measured at urumqi station fig 7 these samples plot above the gmwl and lmwl suggesting the recharged water experienced the processes of vapor condensation in tianshan mountains huang and pang 2012 ma et al 2018 the mean δ2h and δ18o values of groundwater 76 2 and 11 1 in the piedmont plains zone 2 are very similar to that of river water 72 2 and 11 1 in the mountainous area zone 1 indicating that groundwater is recharged by infiltration of river water and lateral inflow from the mountains with little influence of evaporation the relatively high 3h concentrations 40 60 tu in the piedmont plains zone 2 indicate modern precipitation recharge ma et al 2019 with exception of well gw93 the δ2h and δ18o values of the shallow groundwater in the oasis plains zone 3 vary from 82 1 to 68 6 and 12 1 to 10 1 with mean values of 75 7 and 11 1 respectively the 3h concentrations of the shallow groundwater range from 10 3 to 24 8 tu with mean value of 15 6 tu the shallow groundwater in the oasis desert transition zone has relatively high heavy isotopic ratios compared to up gradient shallow groundwater indicating enrichment from irrigation return flow ma et al 2019 intermediate and deep groundwater in the oasis plains zone 3 and the oasis desert transition zone zone 4 have more depleted isotopic compositions likely driven by colder paleoclimates the groundwater in the terminal saline lake and salt playas zone 5 has the most negative values of δ2h and δ18o gw105 gw106 and gw107 and the 14c activities these samples are lower than 5 pmc this suggests that the groundwater in the terminal discharge area is recharged from ancient water under colder climatic conditions ma et al 2018 5 2 mechanisms controlling groundwater chemistry generally the composition of natural groundwater is primarily impacted by the initial composition of the recharge water and water rock interactions which interact with groundwater residence times along the flow paths na cl molar ratio mna cl is useful to characterize water rock interactions in arid regions cl mainly originates from halite dissolution in evaporite deposits with mna cl of 1 however in the aquifers of the mrb the mna cl is higher than 1 fig 6a the excess na relative to cl suggests that silicate weathering i e feldspar or ion exchange may occur in the study area liu et al 2006 zhu et al 2017 ma et al 2018 reported that silicate weathering is not a crucial process that contributes na to groundwater in the mrb based on observed low molar ratios of si na cl average ratio of 0 27 an excess of hco3 so4 2 relative to ca2 mg2 indicates that the processes of dissolution calcite dolomite and gypsum and ion exchange between ca2 or mg2 in groundwater and na in aquifer minerals may occur along the flow paths fig 6b saturation indices si for calcite and gypsum were calculated using phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 the si for calcite lies above and below zero indicating interactions with carbonate minerals along flow paths fig 9 a specially most of the water samples in the mountains zone 1 and piedmont plains zone 2 have negative si values for calcite but positive values in the oasis plains zone 3 and oasis desert transition zone zone 4 this indicates that carbonate dissolution occurs in the mountains and piedmont plains but precipitates in oasis plains and oasis desert transition zone all water samples have negative si values for gypsum indicating the under saturation of gypsum along the groundwater flow paths fig 9b the molar concentrations of ca2 and mg2 in excess of hco3 fig 9c and so4 2 in excess of ca2 fig 9d suggests that groundwater chemistry is impacted by calcite precipitation reverse ion exchange and evapotranspiration effect liu et al 2018 the plot of ca2 mg2 so4 2 hco3 against na cl fig 10 a is useful to evaluate the possible role of ion exchange in the groundwater chemical compositions ma et al 2014 wang et al 2015 if the relationship between these two composite parameters is linear with a slope of 1 ion exchange likely controls the concentrations of these cations the slopes of deep groundwater samples in the oasis plains zone 3 and the oasis desert plains zone 4 are closed to 1 indicating that the chemistry of deep groundwater in these two zones is impacted by ion exchange the positive or negative ion exchange processes can be determined by the chloro alkaline indices cai cai 1 is defined by the ratio of cl na k to cl cai 2 is defined by the ratio of cl na k to hco3 so4 2 no3 a positive value indicates that ion exchange occurs between na in groundwater and ca2 or mg2 within aquifer minerals in contrast a negative value indicates that ion exchange takes place between ca2 or mg2 in the groundwater and na attached to exchange sites on minerals namely reverse ion change wang et al 2015 zhu et al 2017 the cai 1 and cai 2 are below zero for almost all groundwater samples with the exception of gw36 gw47 and gw64 fig 10b this indicates that na is released through the process of reverse ion exchange in the deep groundwater along the flow paths anthropogenic activities such as reservoir construction over exploitation and agricultural cultivations may be influencing groundwater chemistry in the mrb these activities may change the groundwater recharge and discharge and have a complex effect on groundwater geochemistry in the piedmont plains the high no3 concentrations mean concentration of 49 8 mg l indicate that fertilizer are used in the agricultural fields and the applied nutrients can leach through the surface to the groundwater through highly permeable pebbles and gravel deposits in this zone in the oasis plain and oasis desert transition zone agricultural activities impact shallow groundwater chemistry in this zone in the mrb the irrigation return flow and channel leakage account for 42 of total recharge water liu et al 2018 the high concentration of na cl so4 2 and hco3 of shallow groundwater in the oasis plains and oasis desert transition zone suggests that the dissolution of mirabilite na2so4 10h2o halite and trona na2co3 nahco3 2h2o in soil is the dominant processes that impact groundwater chemistry during irrigation water infiltration han et al 2011 xiao et al 2018 5 3 groundwater recharge and mixing features 5 3 1 chloride and stable isotopic indications as one of the largest irrigation areas in xinjiang agriculture is highly developed in the mrb groundwater exploitation for irrigation has changed the hydraulic gradients resulting in groundwater flowing from one aquifer unit or flow path to another in other aquifer systems these changes have been observed to cause mixing of groundwater from different formations changing the chemistry of the well water in important ways ayotte et al 2011 the relationship of δ18o values and cl concentrations has been widely used to determine recharge sources and groundwater mixing features négrel et al 2011 in this study the δ18o values of most groundwater samples fall into a relatively narrow range of 13 to 7 but have a very wide range of cl concentrations table s1 compared to isotopic compositions of precipitation in urumqi station the δ2h and δ18o values exhibit a narrow range from 90 to 50 and 13 to 7 respectively reflecting groundwater mixing along the groundwater flow direction under the hydrologic cycle goller et al 2005 the mixing effect commonly results in the homogeneous stable isotopic variations with the depth and along the groundwater flow paths this phenomenon has also been documented in datong basin of north china xie et al 2012 murry basin of australia cartwright and weaver 2005 and tropical montane forest of south ecuador goller et al 2005 generally the groundwater isotopic compositions δ2h and δ18o remain stable and the 14c activity decreases along the flow paths liang et al 2015 in this study the δ2h and δ18o values are similar across well depth and groundwater flow paths and 14c activity of the deep groundwater gradually decreases in the piedmont plains and the oasis plains indicating that the recharge waters have the same origin and lateral mixing occurs in the study area fig 11 a in the piedmont plains cl concentrations of groundwater range from 101 to 153 mg l and δ18o values range from 13 to 9 the relationship between cl and δ18o indicates that vertical infiltration and lateral mixing are significant in the piedmont plains due to high permeability of the gravel and sand gravel formations groundwater renewal rates are high and residence times are young 30 to 180 years however this situation changes in the downstream of the mrb in the oasis desert transition zone cl concentrations of groundwater samples increase from 17 to 3 780 mg l with relatively constant δ18o values mean value of 12 2 high variation of cl concentrations may be caused by vertical mixing among the aquifers and dissolution of soil minerals where irrigation return occurs 5 3 2 3h and 14c indications tritium 3h activities have been widely used to identify modern precipitation recharge with a half life of 12 32 years mahlknetcht et al 2017 the 3h activity of precipitation in urumqi station was reconstructed from the available data from the international atomic energy agency iaea during the period of 1953 and 2003 fig 12 this curve shows that 3h concentrations in precipitation have decreased since the 1960s and the estimated 3h concentration has since stabilized around 10 tu the mean 3h concentration of shallow groundwater is 15 6 tu in the oasis plains and 11 6 tu in the oasis desert transition zone this suggests the presence of post 1950s recharge which is consistent with the estimated age of 50 180 years assuming piston flow and mixing models tian et al 2010 ma et al 2019 reported that the 3h concentrations of groundwater in the piedmont plains ranged from 40 to 60 tu which indicates that groundwater in this zone is recharged from the vertical infiltration of modern surface water and precipitation with short flow paths 14c activities have been used for determination of groundwater paleo meteoric recharge centuries to millennia and groundwater mixing custodio et al 2018 due to limited recharge from precipitation and surface water in the oasis desert transition zone intensive pumping from long screened wells for agricultural irrigation increases the advection of shallow water into deep aquifer and causes mixture of groundwater chemistry edmunds 2001 knappett et al 2017 generally groundwater residence times increase away from the recharge area along the flow paths atkinson et al 2014 as shown in fig 12b the 14c activities of gw3 depth of 40 m and gw2 depth of 120 m are 97 9 pmc and 73 1 pmc and the isotopic compositions of these two samples are enriched with the values of 55 8 and 56 2 for δ2h and 7 6 and 7 6 for δ18o respectively this suggests the presence of modern water and the recharged water experienced the processes of evapotranspiration in the oasis desert transition zone most of groundwater samples in this zone have higher 14c activities 8 6 73 1 pmc than that in the oasis plains 1 0 3 5 pmc the isotopic compositions of groundwater samples gw13 gw22 gw23 and gw25 are enriched with the values of 65 to 54 for δ2h and 10 to 7 for δ18o the 14c activities among these four samples are between 16 and 18 pmc fig 11b which are higher than that in the groundwater at wells gw5 depth of 260 m and gw15 depth of 300 m in this zone long groundwater flow paths with high 14c activities is caused by vertical mixing between young and much older groundwater owing to pumping with long well screens 5 4 groundwater flow patterns the groundwater flow systems can be referred as local if recharge and discharge areas are contiguous intermediate if these areas are separated by one or more local systems and regional if they extend over the full extent of the basin toth 2009 liang et al 2015 we developed a conceptual hydrogeological model based on the geological and hydrogeological information groundwater levels hydrogeochemical and isotopic data from surface water and groundwater under intensive agricultural activities fig 13 the glacial melting and precipitation in the tianshan mountains supply surface water flows the infiltration of these surface waters in the mountainous areas comprises the main source of groundwater recharge in the piedmont plains the groundwater is characterized by the type of ca hco3 so4 with tds of 300 mg l which is primarily generated through dissolution of calcite and gypsum in this area local groundwater flow systems contain modern groundwater in shallow aquifers within the oasis plains and oasis desert transition zone irrigation water and evaporation are considered as recharge source and groundwater discharge respectively indicating local flow systems operates the shallow groundwater is characterized by the type of na so4 hco3 with tritium concentration of 13 1 tu which is consistent with the groundwater residence times of 50 180 years tian et al 2010 the intermediate flow systems mainly operate in the lowlands zones 3 4 and 5 below the local flow system the groundwater is recharged by the lateral subsurface flow from the piedmont plains and river water infiltration and discharges to evapotranspiration and pumping aquifers in the piedmont plains have higher renewal rates owing to the high permeability of the gravel formations compared to that in the oasis plains and oasis desert transition zone aquifers in the piedmont plains have relatively low renewal rates as a result of lithology dominated by fine sand with groundwater residence times of 5 000 to 10 000 years the dominant processes that impact groundwater geochemistry are mineral dissolution reverse ion exchange and precipitation the intermediate groundwater in the oasis desert transition zone is characterized by the na cl so4 type with high tds of 7 280 mg l moreover the no3 concentrations are higher than 50 mg l indicating that anthropogenic activities such as groundwater pumping and irrigation return flow impact and vertical mixing of groundwater systems occur in this region wang et al 2019 the regional flow systems occur under the intermediate flow system and are recharged from precipitation and glacial melting surface water infiltration within the mountainous area and discharged at oasis plains into terminal manas lake resulting in evaporation aquifers of these systems have much lower renewal rates with groundwater residence times up to 35 000 years groundwater geochemistry is dominantly impacted by water rock interaction and also impacted by evaporation within the terminal discharge area this flow system contains groundwater residence times between 9 000 and 35 000 years in the deep aquifers across the study area with the groundwater residence times older than 25 000 years from wells with greater than 300 m deep the groundwater chemistry varies from ca hco3 so4 type in the piedmont plains to na cl so4 type in manas lake with increasing concentrations of cl and tds along the entire flow paths in the manas river basin 6 conclusion in this study hydrochemistry and environmental isotopes are integrated to characterize groundwater flow systems under the influence of agricultural activities in the manas river basin northwest china groundwater originates from glacier melting and precipitation in the mountains area and the surface water leakages in the mountain front plain or piedmont plains are the main recharge source for groundwater in quaternary unconsolidated materials three hierarchy flow system patterns local intermediate and regional are identified in the mrb local groundwater flow systems contain modern water in the piedmont plains and also operate in the shallow aquifers within the oasis plains and oasis desert transition zone with irrigation water providing a highly evaporated recharge the regional flow systems underlie intermediate flow systems these flow systems contain groundwater 14c ages between 9 000 and 35 000 years in the deep aquifers across the basin with the groundwater residence times older than 25 000 years from wells greater than 300 m deep groundwater chemistry presents an evolutionary trend from ca hco3 so4 type in high topographic areas to na cl type in the lower topographic areas which is a common pattern of hydrogeochemical evolution in arid inland river basin herczeg and edmunds 2000 in arid inland river basins intensive pumping from long screened wells for irrigated agriculture has changed the hydraulic gradients leading to the mixture of modern and much older groundwater in the multi aquifer systems vertical recharge and lateral mixing occur in the piedmont plains and vertical mixing occurs in the oasis desert transition zone and desert as evidence from environmental tracers these mixing processes pose difficulties in characterization of groundwater flow systems pumping induced mixture between young and much older groundwater in the mrb are similar to the minqin basin edmunds et al 2006 dunhuang basin ma et al 2013 east junggar basin li et al 2015 in northwest china and murray basin in australia cartwright 2010 cartwright et al 2010 this insight and approaches can help understanding human impacted groundwater flow systems in the mrb northwest china and other similar semi arid to arid inland basins around the world furthermore the calculation of mixing fraction of young and much older groundwater and the accurate determination of groundwater residence times are significant for better understanding groundwater flow systems in arid inland basins this work is still carried out in the mrb credit authorship contribution statement jianjun wang methodology writing original draft xing liang conceptualization supervision bin ma

4802,pedotransfer functions ptfs provide point predictions of soil hydraulic properties from more readily measured soil characteristics yet uncertainties and biases in measurement methods sampling distributions and boundary conditions can limit accuracy when estimating near saturated hydraulic conductivity kn these limitations may be particularly problematic in understudied urban landscapes that often contain altered hydraulic properties to better treat deficiencies in ptf performance we addressed three objectives which were to 1 develop ptfs to predict urban kn 2 assess bulk density and coarse fragments as explanatory variables and 3 evaluate the predictive capability of these ptfs by comparing their output to measured hydraulic conductivity values from three other studies of urban soil hydraulics we used artificial neural networks ann and random forest rf approaches to predict urban kn with the training dataset including 307 tension infiltrometer tests and other measurements drawn from urban soil assessments in 11 u s cities the ptfs utilized a hierarchy of inputs starting with percentage sand silt clay and then adding percentage coarse fragments and bulk density the ann models performed similar to the rf models and all models exhibited similar or better predictive performance as models results collected from published articles the inclusion of bulk density or coarse fragments did not improve accuracy over soil texture alone possible reasons for this result include low correlation between kn and bulk density and the exclusion of large voids during flow measurements with tension infiltrometers the models have been made available as an open source software package to encourage adoption by users working in urban systems abbreviations kn near saturated hydraulic conductivity ann artificial neural network rf random forest ptf pedotransfer function keywords infiltration artificial neural network random forest pedotransfer function soil science urban hydrology 1 introduction hydraulic conductivity represents a master variable in subsurface water movement regulating infiltration drainage and redistribution of moisture in the soil profile jackson et al 2016 libohova et al 2018 stewart and abou najm 2018 nearly every mainstream model that apportions rainfall between infiltration and surface runoff requires hydraulic conductivity to be constrained alagna et al 2018 ameli et al 2015 li et al 2014 trinh et al 2018 however it is often time consuming and difficult to measure this property in the field meaning that relatively few studies have endeavored to quantify hydraulic conductivity at numerous points or locations e g braud et al 2017 di prima et al 2019 rahmati et al 2018 pedotransfer functions ptfs which predict relatively difficult to measure hydraulic properties from more easily measured physical properties such as soil texture are often used to estimate hydraulic conductivity at multiple points as an example rosetta schaap et al 2001 is based on a ptf that reaches back to the work of rawls et al 1982 rosetta includes a hierarchical structure with flexibility in inputs starting with relatively basic data i e soil textural separates as sand silt clay ascending to more involved data such as bulk density and points along the soil water retention curve i e field capacity at 1 3 bar wilting point at 15 bar overpressure the rosetta model is arguably the most popular predictive algorithm and its inclusion in the hydrus software for modeling unsaturated flow has made its use customary in many hydrological studies schaap 1999 schaap et al 2001 šimůnek et al 2008 many other ptfs also have been developed over the years using anywhere from six to more than 5000 soil samples e g arya et al 1981 1999 arya and paris 1981 gimenez et al 1997 guber and pachepsky 2010 rawls et al 1993 some of these models include additional characterizing information such as soil horizon type organic matter content topography vegetation and general categories of land management moeys et al 2012 sharma et al 2006 wösten et al 1999 further the models represent a variety of techniques to estimate parameter values including multiple regression models lin et al 1999 wösten et al 1999 and artificial neural networks parasuraman et al 2006 schaap 1999 schaap et al 1998 different ptfs have also been integrated together into multi model ensemble predictive tools guber et al 2006 while these various ptfs tend to perform well when predicting water retention characteristics the variability between model output and actual measurement becomes much wider when predicting hydraulic conductivity pachepsky and rawls 2003 rawls et al 1998 current ptfs are typically trained using hydraulic conductivity values collected from soil cores analyzed under laboratory conditions clapp and hornberger 1978 rawls et al 1998 which often do not reflect values measured in the field reynolds et al 2002a 2002b stewart et al 2016 this discrepancy can arise through several means first core sampling is a destructive process carrying with it artifacts like structural cracks and disturbance of soil pore structure second soil cores are uniformly saturated in the laboratory prior to analysis which diverges from typical field saturated or near saturated conditions where air still exists in trapped pockets or large pores reynolds et al 2002a 2002b due to imperfect filling of the core volume soil cores can also allow water to short circuit the soil matrix creating bypass flow between the soil sample and core wall this process exaggerates hydraulic conductivity values though the effect can diminish with longer samples anderson and bouma 1973 nonetheless such inconsistencies point to the need for ptfs based on field relevant hydraulic conductivity values following examples such as jarvis et al 2002 and yang et al 2019 the need for consistent and relevant ptfs is even more critical in urban soils where the paucity of hydraulic conductivity data is particularly acute these soils are often borne of cutting filling and generally re arranging the soil profile and its constituent soil textures herrmann et al 2018 as such urban soils often do not resemble their agricultural forested and undisturbed counterparts the disturbances brought on by urbanization can alter properties such as bulk density bd which often has a negative correlation to hydraulic conductivity gregory et al 2006 hamilton and waddington 1999 likewise coarse fragments e g stones concrete bricks are often incorporated into urban soils during construction or demolition laboratory studies have examined how these materials affect infiltration rates naseri et al 2019 and water retention in urban soils barbu and ballestero 2015 however the role of coarse fragments in restricting or facilitating matrix flow in soils is divergent while not specific to urban soils field based studies have shown that stones in soil can block pathways otherwise open to flow and thus decrease hydraulic conductivity hlaváciková and novák 2014 other studies determined that stony soils can be better aggregated and macroporous cerdà 2001 poesen and ingelmo sanchez 1992 and as a result can have relatively high hydraulic conductivity beckers et al 2016 lilly 2000 thus it appears that the type of coarse fragment s the predominant soil texture of the surrounding matrix and packing e g bulk density all affect hydraulic conductivity in this study we used soil physical datasets measured on urban soils to develop and test the efficacy of new ptf models for estimating near saturated hydraulic conductivity kn we approached our study with three sequential objectives 1 develop a set of ptfs that accurately predict kn in surficial urban soils 2 test the sensitivity of the models to the independent variables of soil bulk density and percentage coarse fragments and 3 evaluate the predictive capability of these models to predict hydraulic conductivity measured in other urban areas we leveraged a novel urban soils dataset collected from 11 u s cities herrmann et al 2018 stewart et al 2019 with n 307 observations of kn serving to train the ptfs the last objective relied on hydraulic conductivity values reported in three other studies n 20 2 methods 2 1 near saturated hydraulic conductivity kn data from urban soils soil samples were collected and field measurements were taken from urban soil profiles located in 11 cities within the united states atlanta ga camden nj cincinnati oh cleveland oh detroit mi new orleans la omaha ne phoenix az portland me tacoma wa and san juan pr fig 1 sites represented 10 of the 12 major soil orders in the united states department of agriculture usda soil taxonomy soil survey staff 2014 the soils assessed were representative of all twelve usda soil textures though the sandy clay silt and silt loam textures had fewer samples than the others fig 1 note that the urban datasets are available for download through a repository maintained by the us government https catalog data gov harvest about epa sciencehub and also have been extensively discussed in herrmann et al 2017 herrmann et al 2018 schifman and shuster 2019 shuster et al 2014 shuster et al 2015 and stewart et al 2019 soil samples were collected from each profile using a 6 cm diameter by 130 cm length hammer action coring cylinder the cores were then separated by diagnostic horizon for further analyses including sand silt and clay percentages sand silt and clay using the hydrometer method gee and bauder 1986 and volumetric percentage of coarse fragments rock as the volume of coarse fragments per horizon identified in the soil core in this study we used data from the uppermost surficial horizon for each profile as these horizons were most pertinent to the surface based infiltration tests we used as described below in total we had data for 307 horizons with n 238 soil profiles including estimates for rock thus representing 78 of the total dataset soil bulk density was also measured on undisturbed soil cores for n 67 surficial horizons representing 22 of the total dataset all sampled horizons were analyzed for their diagnostic information including horizon type thickness and whether or not they were formed by anthropogenic transported material in total 77 of the studied horizons 235 out of 307 were characterized as having evidence of anthropogenically transported materials while the remaining 23 of horizons were deemed to not be of anthropogenic origin further 84 of the sampled layers 256 out of 307 were classified as a horizons with 1 exposed b horizon 38 exposed c horizons 3 profiles deemed to be in process of transitioning from c to a horizons and 9 horizons that were not classified we measured surface infiltration rates using a mini disk tension infiltrometer meter group pullman wa usa for each soil profile four measurements were collected along a transect at each point the surface was cleared of above ground biomass and any other loose debris the infiltrometer was placed directly on the soil surface with the source pressure head set to h 2 cm infiltrated water volumes were measured at 0 5 1 2 3 4 5 10 15 20 and 25 min the infiltration data were fitted toa two term infiltration model zhang 1997 with the hydraulic capillarity parameter α estimated based on the measured soil texture for each surface horizon the model produced estimates for hydraulic conductivity at 2 cm tension for each test the hydraulic conductivity values from the four measurements were then averaged to produce a site level estimate of kn all kn values were transformed using the natural logarithm prior to use in the ptfs 2 2 kn modeling the artificial neural network ann model included input hidden bias and output layers with each layer connected to the next via neurons noting that each neuron computes the weighted average of its input through nonlinear functions fig a1 input layers included sand silt clay and or rock and the output layer was predicted kn we varied the number of hidden layers from 1 to 3 with each layer possessing 2 to 6 neurons as ann model performance was not sensitive to the number of neurons or hidden layers we used 2 hidden layers with 5 neurons for the first hidden layer and 3 for the second hidden layer ann modeling was done with the r package neuralnet fritsch et al 2019 the random forest rf algorithm is a type of regression calculation that allows both numeric and categorical input parameters we set the number of trees to 100 noting that each tree in a rf model represents a single decision tree algorithm and the number of variables in each tree to 2 fig a2a rf modeling was conducted using the r package randomforest liaw and wiener 2002 at first sand silt clay rock and bd were used as predictors however a preliminary analysis revealed that adding bd into the ann and rf models did not significantly improve the model performance table a1 in addition there were only 67 soil samples with measured bd so we omitted that parameter as a predictor in subsequent models after removing bd all models used sand silt and clay as input parameters while the ann with rock and rf with rock models used rock as an additional predictor 2 3 model evaluation the importance of individual input variables was tested by quantifying the increase in model mean square error mse as each variable was removed this analysis determined that sand was the most important variable following by clay silt and rock fig a2b the node purity also showed sand to be the most important factor fig a2c for each ann or rf model we performed random subsampling cross evaluation using a non parametric bootstrapping procedure wherein we randomly selected 80 of the kn values as a training dataset and used the remaining 20 of values as a cross evaluation dataset jian et al 2018 we repeated this process 500 times to generate a distribution of fits for each model during model usage a given input was processed using each individual fit to generate a total of 500 kn predictions with the final output represented as a mean and standard deviation as a test for the broader applicability of the ptfs we also collected published hydraulic conductivity data from other urban soils studies we conducted our literature search through isi web of science using the keywords urban soil hydraulic conductivity or urban soil infiltration to identify relevant studies papers from peer reviewed journals theses and dissertations were included from a total of more than 50 papers we used the following criteria to identify appropriate sources 1 data came from field measurements made on urban soils 2 the study reported hydraulic conductivity or steady state one dimensional infiltration rates which we assumed equivalent to hydraulic conductivity philip 1969 stewart and abou najm 2018 3 sand silt and clay were reported 4 the study location or field conditions were described and 5 the study was located within the usa with these constraints 20 data points were extracted from three papers to form the evaluation dataset hydraulic conductivity values ranged from 0 4 to 18 8 cm h 1 table 1 near saturated hydraulic conductivity values predicted by the models were compared to measured values using both training n 307 and evaluation n 20 data here we used six different statistics to assess model performance intercept slope adj r2 me rmse and d eqs 1 4 first we fitted ordinary least squares regression between the predicted and measured kn values using the natural log transformed data as described above the slope intercept and adjusted r2 adj r 2 of the regression lines were used to assess the ability of each model to predict kn compared to observations the adj r 2 was calculated as 1 adj r 2 1 1 r 2 n 1 n k 1 where r 2 is the coefficient of determination n is the total number of observations and k is the total number of independent variables in the model the adj r 2 was used to quantify how much of the variability in the response variable was explained by the predictor s model fits were also analyzed using 1 mean error me 2 root mean square error rmse and 3 index of agreement d yang et al 2014 me was calculated as 2 me i 1 n y i y i n where y i represents the ith predicted kn value and y i represents the ith measured kn value for interpretation me 0 indicated no bias between measured data and simulation results me 0 indicated that the predicted values were overestimated relative to measured data and me 0 indicated that predicted values underestimated the observed data rmse was calculated as 3 rmse i 1 n y i y i 2 n where smaller rmse values indicated better model performance the metric d was calculated as 4 d 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y y i y 2 where y represents the average of all measured kn values for interpretation d 0 90 was considered to indicate excellent agreement between measured and predicted values 0 80 d 0 90 to indicate good agreement between measured and predicted values 0 70 d 0 80 to show moderate agreement between measured and predicted values and d 0 70 to reveal poor agreement between measured and predicted values yang et al 2014 we also compared the r2 and rmse values corresponding to the models developed in this study versus those same metrics reported for 41 other ptf models in three previous publications table a2 note that neither the ptfs nor the test data in those models were specific to urban soils yet we included this comparison as a way to provide context for the performance of the ptfs developed in this study versus others for our ptfs we included both training and evaluation dataset metrics all data analyses were carried out using r software version 3 5 2 r core team 2019 3 results 3 1 training data we first analyzed the relationship between measured values for kn bd and rock these results showed that kn did not have any notable trends with bd or rock fig 2 we next analyzed the performance of the ptf models fig 3 the training data analysis indicated that the ann model explained approximately 50 of kn variability adj r 2 0 53 table 2 the ann no rock model had relatively low bias with me 0 17 log cm h 1 and low error with rmse 1 03 log cm h 1 the rf no rock model had a slightly lower correlation coefficient as the ann model table 2 with adj r 2 0 45 and rsme 1 04 log cm h 1 the models that accounted for coarse rock fragments had similar amounts of bias as the no rock models with me 0 23 log cm h 1 for the ann model and 0 26 log cm h 1 for the rf model however the with rock models had lower adj r 2 and d values than the models without rock fragments linear regressions between predicted and field measured kn had slopes ranging from 0 61 ann with rock to 1 00 rf no rock and intercepts all 0 30 log cm h 1 3 2 model evaluation when tested against the evaluation dataset the ann and rf models explained between 27 and 33 of variability in kn as determined using adj r 2 table 3 both models had poor agreement with predicted kn d 0 70 the intercepts of both regression lines were 1 34 1 35 log cm h 1 while the slopes were both 0 4 indicating over estimation of kn for small values and under estimation for larger values of kn table 3 and fig 4 we also compared the r2 and rmse values for the models developed in this study versus 41 other ptf models developed for non urban soils the range of r2 values from the present study were similar to or higher than those associated with the other ptf models fig 5 a the rmse values from our models were lower than most generated by the other ptfs fig 5b therefore while our models had low to moderate accuracy for the evaluation dataset their performance was similar to or better than other published ptf models 4 discussion where field based measurement campaigns are not feasible reliable properly constrained pedotransfer functions ptfs can be useful to predict near saturated hydraulic conductivity kn values in the present study we synthesized a novel dataset for urban soil hydraulic and physical parameters into a new set of ptfs as one notable feature our training dataset incorporated in situ assessment methods that were designed to produce consistent and authentic estimates of hydraulic conductivity under near saturated conditions as another we tested both artificial neural network ann and random forest rf techniques these two machines learning techniques differ in their structures and fitting algorithms but produced comparable results for most instances we started our study with the principle that useful ptfs include easy to measure or readily accessible input data and provide predictions with order of magnitude accuracy to the first criterion the models only used sand silt and clay bulk density bd and coarse fragments rock as possible inputs these inputs represent information that can be found almost everywhere in the conterminous united states ncss 2019 and are commonly measured in other locations and studies to the second criterion we assessed ptf accuracy using three summary statistics and linear regression between predicted versus measured kn values when considering all of the evaluation statistics together the ann models had similar performance as the rf models for both the training table 2 and evaluation data table 3 all models had low to moderate adj r 2 values 0 25 0 53 meaning that they explained only 25 53 of the observed variability in kn however the models tended to produce predicted kn estimates that were of the same magnitude as the measured values at the same time the adj r 2 values determined here were similar to those recorded in other studies fig 5 and thereby emphasize the limitations of using ptfs to predict kn and other hydraulic properties the ptf models developed in this study performed better for the training dataset than the evaluation dataset with higher me and rmse values and lower d values one possible reason for this discrepancy is that the two datasets were collected using different infiltration tests the training data were collected using tension infiltrometers while the evaluation data tests were all conducted using double ring infiltration tests these experiments differ in their boundary condition positive versus negative pressure heads and the type of pores that they potentially activate macropores versus matrix pores perhaps for this reason the ptfs predicted kn values that were often lower than the observed hydraulic conductivity values fig 4 specifically it is possible that the double ring tests activated all matrix and macroporous flow paths than would not be captured by the tension infiltrometer numerous studies have compared methods for measuring infiltration braud et al 2017 köhne et al 2011 reynolds et al 2000 verbist et al 2010 and discussed advantages and tradeoffs associated with each based on such consideration we relied on tension infiltration measurements to determine kn for several reasons for one the test itself was simpler e g easier to set up and run requiring less water thereby making it possible to measure kn at four points per plot and at thousands of points during the larger study two double ring infiltrometers can suffer from lateral flow effects unless the outer buffer ring is sufficiently large e g 0 8 m lai and ren 2007 which only exacerbates set up and water supply issues these lateral flow issues can be particularly pronounced in the presence of subsurface restrictive layers three ring infiltrometers can disturb the soil surface during insertion and measurement which can influence surface properties zhang and li 2020 four near saturated flow often occurs even under ponded surface conditions as real world factors such as trapped pockets of air dead end pores and variation in soil wettability induce a field saturated condition reynolds et al 2002a 2002b as a result certain studies have found field saturated hydraulic conductivity and kn to be comparable to each other e g alagna et al 2016 bodhinayake et al 2004 finally the near saturated conditions maintained by at low tension e g 2 cm have been shown to reduce experimental uncertainty relative to ponded measurements verbist et al 2013 decrease non uniform wetting schifman and shuster 2019 while still allowing water to move through many hydraulically active macropores cey and rudolph 2009 based on the applied tension water likely moved through pores approximately smaller than 1 mm in diameter dohnal et al 2010 here we note that other instruments such as guelph permeameters braud et al 2017 comino et al 2016 lilly 2000 and single ring infiltrometers concialdi et al 2020 di prima et al 2019 lozano baez et al 2018 stewart et al 2015 can also characterize hydraulic conductivity these devices typically require considerably less effort and time than double ring infiltrometers albeit with different boundary conditions and more potential for soil disturbance than tension infiltrometers lilly 2000 we also note that the infiltration tests used here primarily interrogated the uppermost soil layers and therefore can be considered to represent surficial urban soils use of subsurface tests such as borehole permeameter tests may help generate ptfs that are more applicable to deeper soil layers e g stewart et al 2019 we originally hypothesized that including rock and bd as input variables would improve kn predictions however our analysis determined that the ann and rf models both performed slightly better when constrained using only textural components i e sand silt clay as inputs this result was unexpected as the ssc models had fewer degrees of freedom compared to the other models it is possible that bd data had little effect on the models due in part to the way in which we constrained bd specifically only 67 out of 307 soil samples included bd values and our comparison between bd and kn did not reveal any significant relationship it is also possible that our kn measurements by taking place at the surface avoided subsurface layers in which compaction can commonly be found herrmann et al 2018 we also note that a newly updated ptf developed using european soil samples determined bd to be only the eighth most important variable in predicting soil hydraulic conductivity szabó et al 2020 coarse fragments were quantified in the same locations as kn with measured volumetric contents ranging from 0 to 90 fig 2 therefore it is unlikely that the lack of predictive power of that variable were caused by data mismatches or limitations with the caveat that coarse percentage were quantified using 5 cm diameter cores and did not include any very large fragments in our study kn was measured in the field using tension infiltrometers which as discussed above may have prevented flow from entering any large voids surrounding the coarse fragments we nonetheless contend that the hydraulic conditions imposed by the tension infiltrometer provide a more consistent e g verbist et al 2013 and realistic assessment of water movement in surficial soils we also note that previous studies e g beckers et al 2016 cerdà 2001 hlaváciková and novák 2014 failed to find consistent relationships between coarse fragment content and hydraulic conductivity despite the aforementioned discrepancies the models developed in this study predicted kn values that closely matched the values measured in the field these results therefore suggest that ptf performance will improve when those functions are developed using field derived data taken from representative landscapes in this study we focused on kn for urban soils due to the lack of models developed for those soils and the rapid rate of urbanization seen in many regions of the world the ability of both ann and rf models to provide order of magnitude kn estimates for different soil textures and conditions suggests that these approaches warrant broader usage particularly as many landscapes become increasingly urbanized nonetheless we recognize that the models can be improved with more data points and analyses and therefore have made the models and data available to the public for more details please refer to section 6 data and code availability we encourage others to continue to develop and refine these models with their own data 5 summary and conclusions pedotransfer functions ptfs can be useful for predicting hydraulic conductivity in instances where direct measurements are not possible however previous ptfs have been derived primarily from agricultural forested or undisturbed soils and therefore may not properly represent urban soils to address this shortcoming we used measurements conducted in 11 u s cities to develop new ptfs for predicting near saturated hydraulic conductivity kn in urban soils as inputs the models included sand silt clay volumetric percentage of coarse fragments such as rock and bulk density our results show that the models had good performance when trained with soil textural separates i e sand silt clay however bulk density and percentage coarse fragments offered little to no improvement in model performance likely due to the lack of any consistent correlation between those variables and kn also the kn values were estimated using tension infiltration tests which offered consistent and easy to perform measurements but may not have fully captured the contributions of large macropores and other heterogeneities e g subsurface compaction layers the ptfs developed here should therefore be considered to best represent the hydraulic behavior of surficial urban soils under near saturated conditions finally the ptfs developed in this study will likely be improved with the addition of more data from a greater number of urban areas and soil conditions to this end we have disseminated the models through an open source package and encourage others to use and further refine these ptf models to better represent urban soil hydraulics 6 data and code availability we developed a publicly available package to disseminate the ann and rf models

network ann models typically have at least 3 layers of neurons including input layer hidden layer s and output layers each of which is connected to the neurons in the next layer parasuraman et al 2006 schaap et al 1998 the input layer acts as the receiver of unweighted input data hidden layers exist between input layers and output layers their function is to process the inputs obtained by its previous layer by activation function applied on it the output layer is the last layer of neurons that produces given outputs for the program an important but difficult challenge is determining the optimal number of hidden layers the number of hidden layers depends on the degree of complexity of the problem and the degree of accuracy required with 1 to 5 hidden layers enough to resolve most problems murata et al 1994 in this study we changed the number of hidden layers from 1 to 3 with each layer having 2 6 neurons we found that the model performance was not sensitive to the number of hidden layers or the number of neurons we thus set the ann model to have 2 hidden layers with 5 neurons for the first hidden layer and 3 neurons for the second hidden layer fig a1 random forest rf models were also used in this study rf is an ensemble regression tree algorithm that can deal with large number of features including categorical variables rf only requires setting two free parameters including the number of trees and number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split the performance of a rf model usually is not sensitive to the values of number of trees and number of variables liaw and wiener 2002 jian et al 2018 the required number of trees can be determined according to the mean square error mse vs number of trees plot fig a2 we set the number of trees 100 in this study the number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split should be smaller or equal to the input variable in the rf model since we had a small number of variables in this study three for rf no rock model and four for the rf with rock model we set the number of variables randomly sampled at each split as 2 
4802,pedotransfer functions ptfs provide point predictions of soil hydraulic properties from more readily measured soil characteristics yet uncertainties and biases in measurement methods sampling distributions and boundary conditions can limit accuracy when estimating near saturated hydraulic conductivity kn these limitations may be particularly problematic in understudied urban landscapes that often contain altered hydraulic properties to better treat deficiencies in ptf performance we addressed three objectives which were to 1 develop ptfs to predict urban kn 2 assess bulk density and coarse fragments as explanatory variables and 3 evaluate the predictive capability of these ptfs by comparing their output to measured hydraulic conductivity values from three other studies of urban soil hydraulics we used artificial neural networks ann and random forest rf approaches to predict urban kn with the training dataset including 307 tension infiltrometer tests and other measurements drawn from urban soil assessments in 11 u s cities the ptfs utilized a hierarchy of inputs starting with percentage sand silt clay and then adding percentage coarse fragments and bulk density the ann models performed similar to the rf models and all models exhibited similar or better predictive performance as models results collected from published articles the inclusion of bulk density or coarse fragments did not improve accuracy over soil texture alone possible reasons for this result include low correlation between kn and bulk density and the exclusion of large voids during flow measurements with tension infiltrometers the models have been made available as an open source software package to encourage adoption by users working in urban systems abbreviations kn near saturated

hydrology 1 introduction hydraulic conductivity represents a master variable in subsurface water movement regulating infiltration drainage and redistribution of moisture in the soil profile jackson et al 2016 libohova et al 2018 stewart and abou najm 2018 nearly every mainstream model that apportions rainfall between infiltration and surface runoff requires hydraulic conductivity to be constrained alagna et al 2018 ameli et al 2015 li et al 2014 trinh et al 2018 however it is often time consuming and difficult to measure this property in the field meaning that relatively few studies have endeavored to quantify hydraulic conductivity at numerous points or locations e g braud et al 2017 di prima et al 2019 rahmati et al 2018 pedotransfer functions ptfs which predict relatively difficult to measure hydraulic properties from more easily measured physical properties such as soil texture are often used to estimate hydraulic conductivity at multiple points as an example rosetta schaap et al 2001 is based on a ptf that reaches back to the work of rawls et al 1982 rosetta includes a hierarchical structure with flexibility in inputs starting with relatively basic data i e soil textural separates as sand silt clay ascending to more involved data such as bulk density and points along the soil water retention curve i e field capacity at 1 3 bar wilting point at 15 bar overpressure the rosetta model is arguably the most popular predictive algorithm and its inclusion in the hydrus software for modeling unsaturated flow has made its use customary in many hydrological studies schaap 1999 schaap et al 2001 šimůnek et al 2008 many other ptfs also have been developed over the years using anywhere from six to more than 5000 soil samples e g arya et al 1981 1999 arya and paris 1981 gimenez et al 1997 guber and pachepsky 2010 rawls et al 1993 some of these models include additional characterizing information such as soil horizon type organic matter content topography vegetation and general categories of land management moeys et al 2012 sharma et al 2006 wösten et al 1999 further the models represent a variety of techniques to estimate parameter values including multiple regression models lin et al 1999 wösten et al 1999 and artificial neural networks parasuraman et al 2006 schaap 1999 schaap et al 1998 different ptfs have also been integrated together into multi model ensemble predictive tools guber et al 2006 while these various ptfs tend to perform well when predicting water retention characteristics the variability between model output and actual measurement becomes much wider when predicting hydraulic conductivity pachepsky and rawls 2003 rawls et al 1998 current ptfs are typically trained using hydraulic conductivity values collected from soil cores analyzed under laboratory conditions clapp and hornberger 1978 rawls et al 1998 which often do not reflect values measured in the field reynolds et al 2002a 2002b stewart et al 2016 this discrepancy can arise through several means first core sampling is a destructive process carrying with it artifacts like structural cracks and disturbance of soil pore structure second soil cores are uniformly saturated in the laboratory prior to analysis which diverges from typical field saturated or near saturated conditions where air still exists in trapped pockets or large pores reynolds et al 2002a 2002b due to imperfect filling of the core volume soil cores can also allow water to short circuit the soil matrix creating bypass flow between the soil sample and core wall this process exaggerates hydraulic conductivity values though the effect can diminish with longer samples anderson and bouma 1973 nonetheless such inconsistencies point to the need for ptfs based on field relevant hydraulic conductivity values following examples such as jarvis et al 2002 and yang et al 2019 the need for consistent and relevant ptfs is even more critical in urban soils where the paucity of hydraulic conductivity data is particularly acute these soils are often borne of cutting filling and generally re arranging the soil profile and its constituent soil textures herrmann et al 2018 as such urban soils often do not resemble their agricultural forested and undisturbed counterparts the disturbances brought on by urbanization can alter properties such as bulk density bd which often has a negative correlation to hydraulic conductivity gregory et al 2006 hamilton and waddington 1999 likewise coarse fragments e g stones concrete bricks are often incorporated into urban soils during construction or demolition laboratory studies have examined how these materials affect infiltration rates naseri et al 2019 and water retention in urban soils barbu and ballestero 2015 however the role of coarse fragments in restricting or facilitating matrix flow in soils is divergent while not specific to urban soils field based studies have shown that stones in soil can block pathways otherwise open to flow and thus decrease hydraulic conductivity hlaváciková and novák 2014 other studies determined that stony soils can be better aggregated and macroporous cerdà 2001 poesen and ingelmo sanchez 1992 and as a result can have relatively high hydraulic conductivity beckers et al 2016 lilly 2000 thus it appears that the type of coarse fragment s the predominant soil texture of the surrounding matrix and packing e g bulk density all affect hydraulic conductivity in this study we used soil physical datasets measured on urban soils to develop and test the efficacy of new ptf models for estimating near saturated hydraulic conductivity kn we approached our study with three sequential objectives 1 develop a set of ptfs that accurately predict kn in surficial urban soils 2 test the sensitivity of the models to the independent variables of soil bulk density and percentage coarse fragments and 3 evaluate the predictive capability of these models to predict hydraulic conductivity measured in other urban areas we leveraged a novel urban soils dataset collected from 11 u s cities herrmann et al 2018 stewart et al 2019 with n 307 observations of kn serving to train the ptfs the last objective relied on hydraulic conductivity values reported in three other studies n 20 2 methods 2 1 near saturated hydraulic conductivity kn data from urban soils soil samples were

2018 schifman and shuster 2019 shuster et al 2014 shuster et al 2015 and stewart et al 2019 soil samples were collected from each profile using a 6 cm diameter by 130 cm length hammer action coring cylinder the cores were then separated by diagnostic horizon for further analyses including sand silt and clay percentages sand silt and clay using the hydrometer method gee and bauder 1986 and volumetric percentage of coarse fragments rock as the volume of coarse fragments per horizon identified in the soil core in this study we used data from the uppermost surficial horizon for each profile as these horizons were most pertinent to the surface based infiltration tests we used as described below in total we had data for 307 horizons with n 238 soil profiles including estimates for rock thus representing 78 of the total dataset soil bulk density was also measured on undisturbed soil cores for n 67 surficial horizons representing 22 of the total dataset all sampled horizons were analyzed for their diagnostic information including horizon type thickness and whether or not they were formed by anthropogenic transported material in total 77 of the studied horizons 235 out of 307 were characterized as having evidence of anthropogenically transported materials while the remaining 23 of horizons were deemed to not be of anthropogenic origin further 84 of the sampled layers 256 out of 307 were classified as a horizons with 1 exposed b horizon 38 exposed c horizons 3 profiles deemed to be in process of transitioning from c to a horizons and 9 horizons that were not classified we measured surface infiltration rates using a mini disk tension infiltrometer meter group pullman wa usa for each soil profile four measurements were collected along a transect at each point the surface was cleared of above ground biomass and any other loose debris the infiltrometer was placed directly on the soil surface with the source pressure head set to h 2 cm infiltrated water volumes were measured at 0 5 1 2 3 4 5 10 15 20 and 25 min the infiltration data were fitted toa two term infiltration model zhang 1997 with the hydraulic capillarity parameter α estimated based on the measured soil texture for each surface horizon the model produced estimates for hydraulic conductivity at 2 cm tension for each test the hydraulic conductivity values from the four measurements were then averaged to produce a site level estimate of kn all kn values were transformed using the natural logarithm prior to use in the ptfs 2 2 kn modeling the artificial neural network ann model included input hidden bias and output layers with each layer connected to the next via neurons noting that each neuron computes the weighted average of its input through nonlinear functions fig a1 input layers included sand silt clay and or rock and the output layer was predicted kn we varied the number of hidden layers from 1 to 3 with each layer possessing 2 to 6 neurons as ann model performance was not sensitive to the number of neurons or hidden layers we used 2 hidden layers with 5 neurons for the first hidden layer and 3 for the second hidden layer ann modeling was done with the r package neuralnet fritsch et al 2019 the random forest rf algorithm is a type of regression calculation that allows both numeric and categorical input parameters we set the number of trees to 100 noting that each tree in a rf model represents a single decision tree algorithm and the number of variables in each tree to 2 fig a2a rf modeling was conducted using the r package randomforest liaw and wiener 2002 at first sand silt clay rock and bd were used as predictors however a preliminary analysis revealed that adding bd into the ann and rf models did not significantly improve the model performance table a1 in addition there were only 67 soil samples with measured bd so we omitted that parameter as a predictor in subsequent models after removing bd all models used sand silt and clay as input parameters while the ann with rock and rf with rock models used rock as an additional predictor 2 3 model evaluation the importance of individual input variables was tested by quantifying the increase in model mean square error mse as each variable was removed this analysis determined that sand was the most important variable following by clay silt and rock fig a2b the node purity also showed sand to be the most important factor fig a2c for each ann or rf model we performed random subsampling cross evaluation using a non parametric bootstrapping procedure wherein we randomly selected 80 of the kn values as a training dataset and used the remaining 20 of values as a cross evaluation dataset jian et al 2018 we repeated this process 500 times to generate a distribution of fits for each model during model usage a given input was processed using each individual fit to generate a total of 500 kn predictions with the final output represented as a mean and standard deviation as a test for the broader applicability of the ptfs we also collected published hydraulic conductivity data from other urban soils studies we conducted our literature search through isi web of science using the keywords urban soil hydraulic conductivity or urban soil infiltration to identify relevant studies papers from peer reviewed journals theses and dissertations were included from a total of more than 50 papers we used the following criteria to identify appropriate sources 1 data came from field measurements made on urban soils 2 the study reported hydraulic conductivity or steady state one dimensional infiltration rates which we assumed equivalent to hydraulic conductivity philip 1969 stewart and abou najm 2018 3 sand silt and clay were reported 4 the study location or field conditions were described and 5 the study was located within the usa with these constraints 20 data points were extracted from three papers to form the evaluation dataset hydraulic conductivity values ranged from 0 4 to 18 8 cm h 1 table 1 near saturated hydraulic conductivity values predicted by the models were compared to measured values using both training n 307 and evaluation n 20 data here we used six different statistics to assess model performance intercept slope adj r2 me rmse and d eqs 1 4 first we fitted ordinary least squares regression between the predicted and measured kn values using the natural log transformed data as described above the slope intercept and adjusted r2 adj r 2 of the regression lines were used to assess the ability of each model to predict kn compared to observations the adj r 2 was calculated as 1 adj r 2 1 1 r 2 n 1 n k 1 where r 2 is the coefficient of determination n is the total number of observations and k is the total number of independent variables in the model the adj r 2 was used to quantify how much of the variability in the response variable was explained by the predictor s model fits were also analyzed using 1 mean error me 2 root mean square error rmse and 3 index of agreement d yang et al 2014 me was calculated as 2 me i 1 n y i y i n where y i represents the ith predicted kn value and y i represents the ith measured kn value for interpretation me 0 indicated no bias between measured data and simulation results me 0 indicated that the predicted values were overestimated relative to measured data and me 0 indicated that predicted values underestimated the observed data rmse was calculated as 3 rmse i 1 n y i y i 2 n where smaller rmse values indicated better model performance the metric d was calculated as 4 d 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y y i y 2 where y represents the average of all measured kn values for interpretation d 0 90 was considered to indicate excellent agreement between measured and predicted values 0 80 d 0 90 to indicate good agreement between measured and predicted values 0 70 d 0 80 to show moderate agreement between measured and predicted values and d 0 70 to reveal poor agreement between measured and predicted values yang et al 2014 we also compared the r2 and rmse values corresponding to the models developed in this study versus those same metrics reported for 41 other ptf models in three previous publications table a2 note that neither the ptfs nor the test data in those models were specific to urban soils yet we included this comparison as a way to provide context for the performance of the ptfs developed in this study versus others for our ptfs we included both training and evaluation dataset metrics all data analyses were carried out using r software version 3 5 2 r core team 2019 3 results 3 1 training data we first analyzed the relationship between measured values for kn bd and rock these results showed that kn did not have any notable trends with bd or rock fig 2 we next analyzed the performance of the ptf models fig 3 the training data analysis indicated that the ann model explained approximately 50 of kn variability adj r 2 0 53 table 2 the ann no rock model had relatively low bias with me 0 17 log cm h 1 and low error with rmse 1 03 log cm h 1 the rf no rock model had a slightly lower correlation coefficient as the ann model table 2 with adj r 2 0 45 and rsme 1 04 log cm h 1 the models that accounted for coarse rock fragments had similar amounts of bias as the no rock models with me 0 23 log cm h 1 for the ann model and 0 26 log cm h 1 for the rf model however the with rock models had lower adj r 2 and d values than the models without rock fragments linear regressions between predicted and field measured kn had slopes ranging from 0 61 ann with rock to 1 00 rf no rock and intercepts all 0 30 log cm h 1 3 2 model evaluation when tested against the evaluation dataset the ann and rf models explained between 27 and 33 of variability in kn as determined using adj r 2 table 3 both models had poor agreement with predicted kn d 0 70 the intercepts of both regression lines were 1 34 1 35 log cm h 1 while the slopes were both 0 4 indicating over estimation of kn for small values and under estimation for larger values of kn table 3 and fig 4 we also compared the r2 and rmse values for the models developed in this study versus 41 other ptf models developed for non urban soils the range of r2 values from the present study were similar to or higher than those associated with the other ptf models fig 5 a the rmse values from our models were lower than most generated by the other ptfs fig 5b therefore while our models had low to moderate accuracy for the evaluation dataset their performance was similar to or better than other published ptf models 4 discussion where field based measurement campaigns are not feasible reliable properly constrained pedotransfer functions ptfs can be useful to predict near saturated hydraulic conductivity kn values in the present study we synthesized a novel dataset for urban soil hydraulic and physical parameters into a new set of ptfs as one notable feature our training dataset incorporated in situ assessment methods that were designed to produce consistent and authentic estimates of hydraulic conductivity under near saturated conditions as another we tested both artificial neural network ann and random forest rf techniques these two machines learning techniques differ in their structures and fitting algorithms but produced comparable results for most instances we started our study with the principle that useful ptfs include easy to measure or readily accessible input data and provide predictions with order of magnitude accuracy to the first criterion the models only used sand silt and clay bulk density bd and coarse fragments rock as possible inputs these inputs represent information that can be found almost everywhere in the conterminous united states ncss 2019 and are commonly measured in other locations and studies to the second criterion we assessed ptf accuracy using three summary statistics and linear regression between predicted versus measured kn values when considering all of the evaluation statistics together the ann models had similar performance as the rf models for both the training table 2 and evaluation data table 3 all models had low to moderate adj r 2 values 0 25 0 53 meaning that they explained only 25 53 of the observed variability in kn however the models tended to produce predicted kn estimates that were of the same magnitude as the measured values at the same time the adj r 2 values determined here were similar to those recorded in other studies fig 5 and thereby emphasize the limitations of using ptfs to predict kn and other hydraulic properties the ptf models developed in this study performed better for the training dataset than the evaluation dataset with higher me and rmse values and lower d values one possible reason for this discrepancy is that the two datasets were collected using different infiltration tests the training data were collected using tension infiltrometers while the evaluation data tests were all conducted using double ring infiltration tests these experiments differ in their boundary condition positive versus negative pressure heads and the type of pores that they potentially activate macropores versus matrix pores perhaps for this reason the ptfs predicted kn values that were often lower than the observed hydraulic conductivity values fig 4 specifically it is possible that the double ring tests activated all matrix and macroporous flow paths than would not be captured by the tension infiltrometer numerous studies have compared methods for measuring infiltration braud et al 2017 köhne et al 2011 reynolds et al 2000 verbist et al 2010 and discussed advantages and tradeoffs associated with each based on such consideration we relied on tension infiltration measurements to determine kn for several reasons for one the test itself was simpler e g easier to set up and run requiring less water thereby making it possible to measure kn at four points per plot and at thousands of points during the larger study two double ring infiltrometers can suffer from lateral flow effects unless the outer buffer ring is sufficiently large e g 0 8 m lai and ren 2007 which only exacerbates set up and water supply issues these lateral flow issues can be particularly pronounced in the presence of subsurface restrictive layers three ring infiltrometers can disturb the soil surface during insertion and measurement which can influence surface properties zhang and li 2020 four near saturated flow often occurs even under ponded surface conditions as real world factors such as trapped pockets of air dead end pores and variation in soil wettability induce a field saturated condition reynolds et al 2002a 2002b as a result certain studies have found field saturated hydraulic conductivity and kn to be comparable to each other e g alagna et al 2016 bodhinayake et al 2004 finally the near saturated conditions maintained by at low tension e g 2 cm have been shown to reduce experimental uncertainty relative to ponded measurements verbist et al 2013 decrease non uniform wetting schifman and shuster 2019 while still allowing water to move through many hydraulically active macropores cey and rudolph 2009 based on the applied tension water likely moved through pores approximately smaller than 1 mm in diameter dohnal et al 2010 here we note that other instruments such as guelph permeameters braud et al 2017 comino et al 2016 lilly 2000 and single ring infiltrometers concialdi et al 2020 di prima et al 2019 lozano baez et al 2018 stewart et al 2015 can also characterize hydraulic conductivity these devices typically require considerably less effort and time than double ring infiltrometers albeit with different boundary conditions and more potential for soil disturbance than tension infiltrometers lilly 2000 we also note that the infiltration tests used here primarily interrogated the uppermost soil layers and therefore can be considered to represent surficial urban soils use of subsurface tests such as borehole permeameter tests may help generate ptfs that are more applicable to deeper soil layers e g stewart et al 2019 we originally hypothesized that including rock and bd as input variables would improve kn predictions however our analysis determined that the ann and rf models both performed slightly better when constrained using only textural components i e sand silt clay as inputs this result was unexpected as the ssc models had fewer degrees of freedom compared to the other models it is possible that bd data had little effect on the models due in part to the way in which we constrained bd specifically only 67 out of 307 soil samples included bd values and our comparison between bd and kn did not reveal any significant relationship it is also possible that our kn measurements by taking place at the surface avoided subsurface layers in which compaction can commonly be found herrmann et al 2018 we also note that a newly updated ptf developed using european soil samples determined bd to be only the eighth most important variable in predicting soil hydraulic conductivity szabó et al 2020 coarse fragments were quantified in the same locations as kn with measured volumetric contents ranging from 0 to 90 fig 2 therefore it is unlikely that the lack of predictive power of that variable were caused by data mismatches or limitations with the caveat that coarse percentage were quantified using 5 cm diameter cores and did not include any very large fragments in our study kn was measured in the field using tension infiltrometers which as discussed above may have prevented flow from entering any large voids surrounding the coarse fragments we nonetheless contend that the hydraulic conditions imposed by the tension infiltrometer provide a more consistent e g verbist et al 2013 and realistic assessment of water movement in surficial soils we also note that previous studies e g beckers et al 2016 cerdà 2001 hlaváciková and novák 2014 failed to find consistent relationships between coarse fragment content and hydraulic conductivity despite the aforementioned discrepancies the models developed in this study predicted kn values that closely matched the values measured in the field these results therefore suggest that ptf performance will improve when those functions are developed using field derived data taken from representative landscapes in this study we focused on kn for urban soils due to the lack of models developed for those soils and the rapid rate of urbanization seen in many regions of the world the ability of both ann and rf models to provide order of magnitude kn estimates for different soil textures and conditions suggests that these approaches warrant broader usage particularly as many landscapes become increasingly urbanized nonetheless we recognize that the models can be improved with more data points and analyses and therefore have made the models and data available to the public for more details please refer to section 6 data and code availability we encourage others to continue to develop and refine these models with their own data 5 summary and conclusions pedotransfer functions ptfs can be useful for predicting hydraulic conductivity in instances where direct measurements are not possible however previous ptfs have been derived primarily from agricultural forested or undisturbed soils and therefore may not properly represent urban soils to address this shortcoming we used measurements conducted in 11 u s cities to develop new ptfs for predicting near saturated hydraulic conductivity kn in urban soils as inputs the models included sand silt clay volumetric percentage of coarse fragments such as rock and bulk density our results show that the models had good performance when trained with soil textural separates i e sand silt clay however bulk density and percentage coarse fragments offered little to no improvement in model performance likely due to the lack of any consistent correlation between those variables and kn also the kn values were estimated using tension infiltration tests which offered consistent and easy to perform measurements but may not have fully captured the contributions of large macropores and other heterogeneities e g subsurface compaction layers the ptfs developed here should therefore be considered to best represent the hydraulic behavior of surficial urban soils under near saturated conditions finally the ptfs developed in this study will likely be improved with the addition of more data from a greater number of urban areas and soil conditions to this end we have disseminated the models through an open source package and encourage

network ann models typically have at least 3 layers of neurons including input layer hidden layer s and output layers each of which is connected to the neurons in the next layer parasuraman et al 2006 schaap et al 1998 the input layer acts as the receiver of unweighted input data hidden layers exist between input layers and output layers their function is to process the inputs obtained by its previous layer by activation function applied on it the output layer is the last layer of neurons that produces given outputs for the program an important but difficult challenge is determining the optimal number of hidden layers the number of hidden layers depends on the degree of complexity of the problem and the degree of accuracy required with 1 to 5 hidden layers enough to resolve most problems murata et al 1994 in this study we changed the number of hidden layers from 1 to 3 with each layer having 2 6 neurons we found that the model performance was not sensitive to the number of hidden layers or the number of neurons we thus set the ann model to have 2 hidden layers with 5 neurons for the first hidden layer and 3 neurons for the second hidden layer fig a1 random forest rf models were also used in this study rf is an ensemble regression tree algorithm that can deal with large number of features including categorical variables rf only requires setting two free parameters including the number of trees and number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split the performance of a rf model usually is not sensitive to the values of number of trees and number of variables liaw and wiener 2002 jian et al 2018 the required number of trees can be determined according to the mean square error mse vs number of trees plot fig a2 we set the number of trees 100 in this study the number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split should be smaller or equal to the input variable in the rf model since we had a small number of variables in this study

4803,with the increasing awareness of the environmental challenges the porous asphalt pavement has shown greater interests in terms of stormwater management underground water quality improvement mitigation of heat island effect and reduction of traffic noise however these environmental benefits will deteriorate once the porous asphalt pavement is clogged by particles the aim of this study was using the discrete element method coupled with computational fluid dynamics dem cfd model to numerically reveal the clogging development in the porous asphalt pavement under rainfall considering the climate air voids of the pavement flow rate mass of clogging materials and pavement structure the degradation of air voids in the double layer porous asphalt pavement under gravity and or rainfall was predicted the results demonstrated that the clogging evolves through four stages namely rapid clogging slow clogging partial recovery and clogging stability in the pavement under rainfall the effects of the climate air voids mass of clogging materials and pavement structure on the clogging development are significant flow rate imposes negligible effect on clogging evolution in the porous pavement all factors induce impacts on clogging rate and the distribution frequency of clogging particles in the pavement additionally after clogging air voids in the double layer porous asphalt pavement is reduced by 0 8 in the sunny days and 0 55 in the rainy days the findings in this study contribute to the design and maintenance of the double layer porous asphalt pavement with superior environmental benefits keywords porous asphalt pavement dem cfd model clogging development clogging materials air voids 1 introduction porous asphalt pavement has been acknowledged as a multifunctional and sustainable pavement which features a high interconnected air voids volume of 20 or higher and allows water to percolate promptly imran et al 2013 accordingly it provides significant environmental benefits including the reduction of the stormwater runoff quantity improvement of water quality enhancement of skid resistance and driving safety mitigation of heat island effect and reduction of traffic noise asaeda and ca 2000 li et al 2013a alber et al 2018a starke et al 2010 compared to porous cement pavement and porous polyurethane pavement porous asphalt pavement shows lower cost and better maintenance conventional porous asphalt pavement consists of a single layer porous asphalt mixture having a thickness of 40 70 mm isenring et al 1990 mcgovern et al 2011 tan et al 2004 shimeno et al 2010 which has been widely implemented over the world for instance 67 of the existing road surface in japan is paved with porous asphalt concrete and the single layer porous asphalt pavement is claimed to be in good state after 15 years service takahashi 2013 over 90 of major highways in the netherlands are constructed with porous asphalt mixture zhang et al 2016 the material known as open graded friction course has been used in various states of the united states alvarez et al 2010 2011 martin et al 2013 however due to thin layer the single layer porous asphalt pavement has limited improvement of performance functions insufficient mechanical strength road maintenance issues in winter and pore blockage the double layer porous asphalt pavement was proposed in japan and some european counties to facilitate greater capacity for water infiltration and storage road safety moderation of heat island effect and sound absorption van bochove 1996 hamzah et al 2013 the top layer of the double layer porous asphalt pavement is composed of finer aggregates with small air voids and the bottom layer embraces coarser aggregates with large air void ratios typically basalt and limestone are extensively used as coarse and fine aggregates in asphalt mixture respectively ding et al 2019a zhu et al 2020a chen et al 2020 the air voids in the two layers are connected to ensure the drainage of rain water and act as mitigation tubes which could absorb noise energy and thermal energy the top later is designed to prevent clogging and pavement material loosing and lost which occur in a single layer porous asphalt thus the double layer porous asphalt pavement with thick layer of porous asphalt could greatly improves the pavement functionality tang et al 2020a 2020b clogging of the interconnected air voids is the key issue associated with the sustainability of porous asphalt pavement which occurs when fine particles block the pores and consequently weakens the drainage capacity skid resistance and sound absorption properties of the pavement chu and fwa 2019 yong et al 2013 clogging material is usually a mixture of dust residual soil the wearing materials of the road s surface and vehicle tires and the surrounding vegetation martin et al 2013 to tackle the problem of pore clogging some methods have developed to maintain the permeability function of the pavement including moistening followed by sweeping sweeping followed by suction suction alone and high pressure water jects combined with simultaneous suction razzaghmanesh and beecham 2018 several different methods have been applied to investigate the clogging of porous pavement from experiments and numerical simulations xie et al 2019 razzaghmanesh and beecham 2018 alber et al 2018b 2019 concerning experiments as clogging contribute significantly to the permeability loss of porous pavement the infiltration capacity of porous mixture is measured with different methods including single ring and double ring infiltrometers dougherty et al 2011 li et al 2013b and permeameters ranieri et al 2012 garcia et al 2020 particularly falling head and constant head permeameters are the most widely used devices for permeability measurements on porous pavement due to their simplicity and the limitations induced by the measurements in situ ranieri et al 2012 garcia et al 2019 fwa et al 2002 2015 to consider more realistic and accurate conditions these infiltration experiments are carried out with the aid of rainfall simulators andres valeri et al 2016 additionally by using 3d computed tomography images the relationship between the internal structure and the properties of a permeable concrete after clogging was analyzed coleri et al 2013 kayhanian et al 2012 zhang et al 2018a however these approaches were implemented on the opaque asphalt mixture and the final properties of porous pavement after clogging were evaluated as a result the clogging development of porous pavement needs to be explored numerical simulation is a promising approach to explore the pore clogging behavior of porous systems among numerical methods discrete element method dem was proposed to study the interaction between assemblies of discrete particles based on newton s second law and finite difference scheme it is a promising approach to study behaviors of asphalt mixture including stiffness abbas et al 2007 fatigue carmona et al 2007 fracture kim et al 2008 dynamic shear modulus zhang et al 2019a 2019b 2003 you and buttlar 2006 rutting ma et al 2018 tong et al 2020 and high temperature creep ma et al 2016a dem modeling is also employed to construct aggregates with various shapes and angularities yang et al 2016 ding et al 2017 2019b zhang et al 2019c and to evaluate the influence of size non deformability and shape of aggregate on performance of asphalt mixture zhang et al 2003 2014 huang et al 2014 furthermore dem simulation is performed to reconstruct air void structures in asphalt concrete and investigate influence of air voids structure on rutting high temperature creep behavior and fatigue life of asphalt mixture ma et al 2016a 2016c zhang et al 2018b zhu et al 2020b more importantly to study the permeability of porous concrete pieralisi et al 2017 developed and validated advanced discrete element method coupled with computational fluid dynamics dem cfd model zhang et al 2018c employed the dem cfd model to numerically confirm the pore clogging mechanism and clogging development in porous pavement taking into account of the pavement porosity sediments size distribution horizontal runoff velocity and seepage velocity however few studies have devoted to the clogging mechanism in the double layer porous asphalt pavement by performing dem cfd simulation this study aims to reveal the clogging mechanism in the double layer porous asphalt pavement using three dimensional dem cfd model which is implemented in pfc3d with dem modeling the virtual double layer porous asphalt pavement was reconstructed the virtual clogging test is performed on the porous asphalt pavement under gravity and or water flow the most critical factors that impacts clogging process i e the climate air voids of asphalt pavement flow rate mass of clogging materials and pavement structure were discussed furthermore dem cfd numerical model is employed to predict degradation of air voids in the double layer porous asphalt pavement during the clogging process fig 1 illustrates research plan in this study 2 experimental 2 1 materials three types of porous asphalt mixtures with target porosities of 20 22 and 20 were prepared in the laboratory based on marshall mix design method ministry of transport of the people s republic of china 2004 namely pac10 pac16 and pac13 high viscosity asphalt was used in pacs and its properties are summarized in table 1 basalt and limestone aggregate were utilized in pac10 and pac16 respectively while basalt aggregate was added in pac13 the properties of aggregates are listed in table 2 and the gradations for three pacs are shown in fig 2 table 3 illustrates the composition of three porous asphalt mixtures is summarized high viscosity asphalt with content of 4 92 4 50 and 4 92 was utilized in pac10 pac16 and pac13 respectively aggregates with nominal maximum aggregate sizes of 10 mm 16 mm and 16 mm were incorporated into pac10 pac16 and pac16 respectively 2 2 fabrication of double layer porous asphalt pavement in the field double layer porous asphalt pavement could be laid and compacted through hot on hot and hot on cold methods in the hot on hot technique both bottom and top pac layers are laid and paved simultaneously in the hot on cold process the bottom coarser pac layer was placed and compacted first and the top finer pac layer was laid and compacted at a later time it was found that the holt on cold technique generates core specimens which are less permeable compared to specimens by the hot on hot method hamzah 2007 in this study the double layer porous asphalt pavement specimen consisted of 25 mm pac10 and 40 mm pac16 was prepared by following the procedure pac16 with thickness of 40 mm was firstly placed at the bottom of the mold pac10 with thickness of 25 mm was then put on the surface of pac16 both pacs were simultaneously compacted into the double layer porous asphalt pavement specimen as shown in fig 3 2 3 characterization of clogging materials the clogging materials used in this study was collected from surface runoff of the local double layer porous asphalt pavement with a long service life the runoff solution was dried and then analyzed by gradation test which is detailed in table 4 it is noted that the clogging materials are composed of 9 particles larger than 2 36 mm 56 sand with dimension between 0 075 2 36 mm and 35 residual soil and dust particles smaller than 0 075 mm 2 4 laboratory clogging experiment a rectangular specimen with dimension of 60 mm 60 mm 65 mm was prepared by core drilling from the double layer porous asphalt pavement specimen the laboratory clogging test was performed on this specimen as described below 1 the sample was covered with transparent tape in the surrounding sides and then placed in the rainfall simulation apparatus shown in fig 4 a rainfall simulator was located on top of pavement the gap between the specimen and the sample container was filled with epoxy glue to ensure waterproof 2 approximately 1g of clogging particles were sprinkled evenly over the top surface of the sample 3 500 ml of water was injected into the tank the drain water was collected at the bottom of the specimen and dried in the oven which was weighted as b 4 after drying the specimen the remaining particles on the surface of the specimen were collected with weight of c 5 the sieving test was performed on the dried particles collected from the runoff and surface of the specimen 6 the cumulative weight of clogging materials in the specimen was calculated by 10 b c at each sieve size 3 discrete element simulation 3 1 generation of coarse aggregates by developing a specific modeling algorithm in pfc3d ma et al 2016 2018 three dimensional irregular coarse aggregates larger than 2 36 mm were generated as follows 1 the realistic shape of a coarse aggregates is captured by a 3d scanner as shown in fig 5 a 2 based on greyscale analysis of the images the three dimensional skeleton of coarse aggregates was obtained as shown in fig 5 b 3 the discrete ball elements with different sizes were generated to fill into the gap of the aggregate skeleton and the virtual coarse aggregates with irregular shapes close to the realistic shapes were built as shown in fig 5 c by repeating the procedure the virtual aggregates with different shapes and sizes were formed as shown in fig 6 table 5 shows the average volume of aggregates in response to different sizes finally physical and mechanical parameters e g density young s modulus poisson s ratio and friction coefficient were accredited to coarse aggregates thus a virtual three dimensional coarse aggregate database was established 3 2 reconstruction of the single layer and double layer porous asphalt pavements based on discretized modeling the microstructure of asphalt mixture consisted of coarse aggregates asphalt mastic asphalt binder and fine aggregates smaller than 2 36 mm and air voids was reconstructed the following procedure was taken to reconstruct the virtual double layer asphalt pavement specimen having 25 mm pac10 and 40 mm pac16 for top and bottom layers 1 a virtual steel mold with two layers was generated with the diameter of 100 mm and heights of 50 mm and 80 mm for the top and bottom layers as shown in fig 7 a 2 coarse aggregates with designed gradation were selected from the virtual aggregate database and poured into the virtual mold as shown in fig 7 b aggregate pebbles with blue and green colors were placed in the top and bottom layers of the mold respectively 3 asphalt mastic was represented by discrete ball elements with radius of 1 mm the volume of asphalt mastic was calculated based on mix design of asphalt mixture and then incorporated into the aggregate volume as shown in fig 7 c 4 the dynamic movement controlled by a complex algorithm was applied to compact the specimen and the virtual double layer asphalt mixture specimen with diameter of 100 mm and height of 65 mm was reconstructed as shown in fig 7 d 5 to generate air voids the balls with radius of 0 5 mm were regularly arranged and filled into the space in the specimen when the ball was in contact with all ball units of asphalt mastic and pebbles of coarse aggregates the ball was deleted and the remaining balls indicated air voids to reduce the impact of the mold edge air voids were generated in the center area of the specimen with dimension of 60 mm 60 mm 65 mm as shown in fig 8 e the red particles represent air voids in the specimen the two dimensional porosity of the specimen was calculated by the equation 1 vv i n i 60 60 where vv i is the porosity at the ith layer n i is the number of red balls indicating air voids fig 8 shows the distribution of pavement porosity with depth it is observed that the pavement porosity exhibits a smooth transition between the top layer and bottom layer of the specimen the average porosity in the top and bottom layers of the virtual specimen was found to be 18 99 and 21 03 respectively which were consistent with the designed air voids of 20 and 22 in the laboratory specimen respectively hence the microstructure of the virtual double layer porous asphalt pavement specimen was verified in order to further simplify this model the original balls of asphalt mastic and aggregates were eliminated while the balls of air voids were retained in the rectangular specimen then the balls with radius of 0 5 mm were regularly arranged and reloaded in the specimen which indicate homogeneous asphalt mixture if the ball units of asphalt mixture and the balls of air voids were overlapped the ball units were deleted the remaining is the reconstructed specimen with uniform ball units as shown in fig 9 a to prevent the infiltration of dust particles into the gap between ball units of asphalt mixture the virtual specimen is encrypted firstly the balls with radius of r were generated and regularly arranged in the specimen which represent the encryption units r 2 1 r 2 where r is half of the distance between two contacting ball units of asphalt mixture then if the encryption unit and the ball unit of air void was in contact the encryption unit was deleted the remaining structure was encrypted specimen as shown in fig 9 b as shown in fig 10 c the blue red and yellow balls represent asphalt mixture air voids and encryption units it is obvious that the encryption units only exist between the ball units of asphalt mixture by performing the procedure described above the virtual single layer porous asphalt pavement was also reconstructed with dem simulation 3 3 modeling of clogging materials the balls with different sizes were utilized to represent clogging materials in pfc3d it is assumed that 1g of clogging material with density of 2 7 g cm3 was poured into the virtual specimen the median of two adjacent sieve sizes was regarded as the average particle size based on gradation of clogging materials the ball number of particles at each size was calculated as shown in table 2 the balls with a series of sizes and numbers were applied on the upper face of the rectangular specimen as shown in fig 10 the balls with unique color indicate each size appropriate micromechanical contact models are incorporated after the microstructure modeling of the specimen pfc3d provides four basic models of micro constitutive contacts including burger s model stiffness model bonding model and slip model itasca consulting group 2004 stiffness model was utilized to describe micromechanical contacts between clogging materials and contacts between clogging materials and asphalt specimen the elastic modulus poison ratio and friction coefficient of both constituents were set to be 70 0 gpa 0 18 and 0 5 respectively 3 4 modeling of the virtual clogging test under gravity in the sunny day clogging material enters pores in asphalt pavement with the wind and pumping between vehicle tires and asphalt road dem modeling is performed to simulate clogging in the porous asphalt pavement under gravity which corresponds to that in the sunny day in the virtual clogging test the gravity field g 9 8 n m2 was applied to the specimen the ball units of asphalt mixture were assigned with velocity and angular velocity of 0 which kept static in the clogging test the ball units of clogging material collided with the static balls of asphalt mixture which were moving in the specimen the trajectory of the moving clogging material was recorded every 50000 timesteps the clogging test was stopped when the volume of clogging particles entrapped in the specimen reached constant fig 11 illustrates distribution of clogging materials in the double layer porous asphalt pavement as can be noted in fig 11 a clogging is formed on the pavement surface fig 11 b demonstrates that larger particles with purple and brown colors are entrapped in the upper of the specimen while smaller particles are broadly distributed in the upper and middle layers of the specimen a closer inspection of the clogging in fig 11 c shows that the clogging materials are accumulated in the porous asphalt pavement in three ways 1 smaller particles are accumulated in the void spaces of porous pavement 2 smaller particles trap larger particles 3 fine particles are accumulated firstly and larger particles are then assembled the last two ways were more commonly observed thus the clogging in the porous asphalt pavement under gravity is primarily attributed to the accumulation of larger particles 3 5 dem cfd modeling of the virtual clogging test under gravity and water flow during and after rain events the particles on the pavement surface are carried by rainwater contributing to the clogging of voids in the pavement in this study the virtual clogging test under rainfall was conducted on the porous pavement by the dem cfd two way coupling method the cfd model in pfc3d solved the particle fluid interaction based on the volume averaged coarse meshing method in the fluid in each fluid unit the force by the fluid is distributed to each particle meanwhile porosity and fluid drag force in the fluid unit were calculated from characteristics of particles the two way coupling was realized by timely exchanging information between pfc and fluid solver the motion of particle is described by standard equations in pfc3d which considers the particle fluid interaction force 3 u t f mech f fluid m g the symbols u m g denote the particle weight particle mass and gravitational acceleration the term fmech is the external force of the particles including applied force and contact force the term ffluid is the total force that the fluid applied on the particles it is the sum of fluid drag force and the force due to the fluid pressure gradient the fluid drag force stemming from the difference between particle and fluid velocities depends on how the porosity is calculated it is defined as 4 f drag f 0 x where f0 is the drag force applied on single particle is porosity of the fluid cell x is empirical coefficient which ensures the fluid drag force is suitable to the fluid with high and low porosity and supports a wide range of reynolds numbers the drag force that single particle is subjected to is given by 5 f 0 1 2 c d ρ f π r 2 u v u v where c d ρ f r u and v are the drag force coefficient fluid density radius of the particle fluid velocity and particle velocity the drag force coefficient cd is a function of the particle reynolds number rep 6 c d 0 63 4 8 r e p the empirical coefficient x is expressed as 7 x 3 7 0 65 e x p 1 5 log 10 r e p 2 2 the reynolds number is calculated by 8 r e p 2 ρ f r u v μ f where μ f is the dynamic viscous coefficient of the fluid in each fluid unit porosity body force fb fluid velocity v fluid pressure p the fluid pressure gradient p fluid density ρ f and dynamic viscous coefficient of the fluid μ f were determined by pfc3d software the body force fb is written as 9 f b f drag v where v is the volume of fluid unit the procedure of dem cfd simulation is illustrated in fig 12 the fluid was meshed by walls ensuring that asphalt pavement and clogging material were embraced in the cell the rainfall was applied on the specimen at a rate of 0 015 m s water flowed in the top of the specimen with dimension of 60 mm 60 mm and was discharged into the wall space at the bottom of the specimen with dimension of 50 mm 50 mm other boundaries of the specimen were impervious gravity was also applied in the dem cfd simulation to investigate clogging of porous asphalt pavement under water flow and gravity as shown in fig 13 3 6 the simulation cases as shown in table 6 the varied parameter of case 1 is the climate involving sunny day and rainy day which were controlled by dem simulation under gravity and or water flow case 2 4 is air voids flow rate and mass of clogging materials the case 5 compares the clogging between the single and double layer porous asphalt pavement which was constructed by pac13 and pac10 pac16 respectively the computational time step designed for the fluid is 5 0 10 4 s and for the particles is 5 0 10 6 s the relationship of the cumulative weight of clogging particles with time was acquired to reveal the clogging development in the porous asphalt pavement the ratio of the clogging particles number in the specimen to the total number of clogging particles is characterized as clogging ratio the influences of climate air voids flow rate mass of clogging materials and pavement structure on the clogging development and clogging ratio of particles in the porous asphalt pavement will be described below furthermore degradation of air voids in the double layer porous asphalt pavement after clogging was predicted 4 results and discussion 4 1 verification of the virtual clogging test both laboratory and virtual clogging tests were performed on the double layer porous asphalt pavement under similar condition fig 14 shows comparison in clogging ratio between experimental and simulation results under gravity and water flow based on experimental results it is observed that 0 30mm clogging particles present highest clogging ratio while 0 075mm clogging particles show lowest clogging ratio among the clogging particles this is attributed to that the clogging characteristics are affected by the porosity and sizes of air voids in porous asphalt pavement furthermore it is also noticed that the difference between experimental and simulation results are within 3 4 which is acceptable thus the virtual clogging test by dem cfd simulation is verified 4 2 impact of weather on clogging fig 15 a displays the clogging development in the double layer porous asphalt pavement under gravity and or water flow which correspond to that in the sunny and rainy days it is noticed that in sunny day or under gravity the clogging in porous pavement experiences three stages rapid clogging stage slow clogging stage and stable clogging stage before 1 65s a number of smaller particles enter void spaces in the porous asphalt pavement contributing to increasing in accumulated weight of clogging particles with the blockage of air channels the clogging rate is reduced resulting in slow clogging stage after 1 65s fraction of particles in the pavement tends to be saturated leading to the stable clogging stage on the other hand in rainy day or under gravity and water flow the clogging development is divided into four stages rapid clogging stage slow clogging stage mitigation of clogging stage and stable clogging stage the clogging weight increases rapidly and slowly increases before 0 28s and then falls down slight and finally tend to be stable after 1 0s with the continuous supply of particles source the weight of clogging particles in the porous asphalt pavement increases then decreases and finally tends to be saturated the reduction in mass of clogging particles is attributed to the infiltration of fine particles with water flow the change in cumulative weight of clogging particles in the rapid clogging stage is characterized as rate of clogging the clogging rate is 0 21 g s and 1 33 g s for the clogging of the pavement in the sunny and rainy day respectively furthermore the weight of particles accumulated in the porous pavement is up to 0 40g and 0 28g in the sunny day and rainy day respectively thus in comparison with clogging in the sunny day clogging rate is enhanced by 6 4 times and the cumulative weight of clogging particle is reduced by 30 in the rainy day fig 15 b shows the change in cumulative mass of clogging particles in the upper and lower layers of the specimen with time the clogging development in the upper layer is similar to that in the whole porous pavement the particles initially percolate into the upper layer which leads to the increase in weight of clogging particles in this layer rapidly and peak value after 0 28s then the conglomerated particles in the upper layer transport downward to the lower layer it leads to the increase in mass of clogging particles in the lower layer at 0 5s the mass of particles entrapped in the lower layer reaches the maximum value then the particles infiltrate with simulated rainfall resulting in the decrease in particle weight in the lower layer finally clogging materials in the upper and lower layers stop moving resulting in constant weight of clogging particles in the specimen it is noticed that the ultimate weight of particles in the upper and lower layers of the specimen is approximately 0 25g and 0 03g respectively as a result the particles are concentrated in the upper layer of the double layer porous asphalt pavement which is almost 8 3 times more than that in the lower layer of the pavement fig 16 displays the relationship between the clogging ratio and particle size it can be observed that particles smaller than 0 075 mm cause rapid clogging steady clogging mitigation of clogging and steady clogging in the porous pavement while particles with the size of 0 15 0 6 mm induce rapid clogging and steady clogging particles that are bigger than 0 60 mm cause none or less clogging at 1s the clogging ratio reaches up to 36 37 38 36 and 0 corresponding to 0 075 mm 0 15 mm 0 30 mm 0 60 mm and 1 18 mm particles respectively obviously particles in a size range of 0 075 0 60 mm accumulate uniformly within the double layer porous asphalt pavement this is because smaller particles easily get trapped while larger particles are difficult to migrate and thus blocked outside of the pavement for this reason to design anticlogging porous asphalt mixture the first step would be to determine the sizes of the clogging materials in service location and then design the mixture with the highest sieve grading efficiency for that clogging materials 4 3 impact of air voids on clogging fig 17 a shows the variation of the clogging development in the double layer porous asphalt pavement with a series of air voids i e 20 24 in the upper layer and 22 in the lower layer of the pavement as can be noted the clogging curves of porous pavement exhibit consistent trend between different air voids which involves rapid clogging slow clogging mitigation of clogging and steady clogging stage the weight of particles reaches the peak value at 0 28s which is 0 33g 0 37g and 0 48g when the porosity of the upper layer is 20 22 and 24 respectively correspondingly the ultimate weight of particles retained in the specimen is 0 28g 0 32g 0 43g respectively thus as air voids increase from 20 to 24 the clogging rate and the cumulated weight of particles in the pavement is increased by 36 and 53 respectively fig 17 b illustrates the clogging development in the upper and lower layers of the double layer porous asphalt pavement with different air voids it is found that air voids impose higher impact on clogging in the upper layer than that in the lower layer of the specimen the cumulated weight of clogging materials in the upper layer of the specimen is up to 0 25g 0 30g 0 40g for air voids of 20 22 and 24 respectively the corresponding value in the lower layer of the specimen is 0 03g 0 02g and 0 03g respectively accordingly as air voids rise from 20 to 22 58 more particles are conglomerated in the upper layer of the double layer porous asphalt pavement fig 17 c illustrates the change in distribution frequency of the clogging particles with air voids it can be seen that clogging ratio depends on both particle size and air voids in the pavement considering the upper layer having air voids of 20 particles with size of 0 075 0 6 mm are uniformly distributed in the porous pavement given air voids of 22 and 24 particles with size of 0 15 mm are highly accumulated in the system meanwhile a small amount of 1 18 mm particles is concentrated in the pavement with air voids of 24 when increasing air voids of the upper layer from 20 to 24 the clogging ratio is increased by 15 47 12 and 17 for 0 075 mm 0 15 mm 0 3 mm 1 18 mm particles respectively whereas it is decreased by 11 for 0 6 mm particles thus to enhance anticlogging capacity it is suggested to control air voids of the upper layer in the double layer porous asphalt pavement 4 4 impact of flow rate on clogging fig 18 a shows the change in clogging development in the double layer porous asphalt pavement with flow rates it is noted that flow rate has no impact on four stages in the clogging development of the pavement while high flow rate accelerates the clogging rate of particles in the pavement the ultimate weight of clogging particle is 0 28g at 1 0s 0 26g at 0 9s and 0 26g at 0 7s in response to flow rate of 0 01 m s 0 015 m s and 0 02 m s respectively thus as flow rate increases from 0 01 m s to 0 02 m s a nearly 2 fold increase in clogging rate is recorded and 5 less particles are attached in the pavement fig 18 b displays the change in clogging development in the upper and lower layer of the pavement with flow rate in the upper layer of the porous pavement the ultimate weight of clogging particles turns into 0 25g at 0 8s 0 26g at 0 4s 0 26g at 0 3s when flow rate is 0 01 m s 0 015 m s and 0 02 m s respectively the corresponding value in the lower layer of the porous pavement is 0 03g at 1 0s 0 003g at 0 9s 0 002g at 0 7s respectively similarly flow rate has negligible impact on the cumulative weight of clogging particles in the upper layer of the pavement the weight of clogging particles in the lower layer of the pavement is slightly reduced as flow rate increases this might be due to the fact that more particles pass through the lower layer of the pavement as flow rate increases fig 18 c shows the change in distribution frequency of clogging particles in the porous pavement with flow rate it is noted that the particles in the size range of 0 075 0 6 mm are trapped in the pavement under various flow rates with flow rate of 0 01 m s particles in the size range of 0 075 0 6 mm are uniformly distributed in the pavement given flow rate of 0 02 m s 0 6 mm particles are mainly concentrated in the pavement hence as flow rate increases larger particles are accumulated in the pavement although the total cumulative weight of clogging materials is not affected 4 5 impact of mass of clogging materials on clogging fig 19 a shows the change in clogging development in the double layer porous asphalt pavement with mass of clogging materials it is evident that the cumulative weight of clogging particles in the porous asphalt pavement increases with mass of clogging materials the ultimate weight of particles in the pavement is 0 28g 0 81g and 1 22g when dosing particles of 1 7g 3 4g and 5 1g respectively the time that clogging reaches steady stage is negligibly affected by the weight of clogging particles accordingly as mass of clogging materials increases from 1 7g to 5 1g the clogging rate and cumulative weight of particles are nearly raised by 2 3 and 4 4 times respectively fig 19 b displays the cumulative weight of particles in the upper and lower layers of the pavement with different mass of clogging materials it is obvious that mass of clogging materials imposes significant effect on the cumulative weight of particle in the upper layer of the pavement and slight influence on that in the lower layer of the pavement with the increased clogging particles from 1 7g to 5 1g the cumulative weight of particles in the upper layer is increased from 0 25g to 1 15g with a nearly 4 6 times enhancement fig 19 c shows the variation in distribution frequency of clogging particles in the porous pavement with mass of clogging materials it is noted that the particles in the size range of 0 075 0 6 mm uniformly invade the porous pavement when dosing 1 7g clogging particles when adding 5 1g particles the particles in the size range of 0 075 1 18 mm are settled in the pavement thus high amounts of clogging particles allow the accumulation of larger particles fig 20 displays the variation of weight of clogging particles retained in the pores of the specimen with the weight of clogging materials on the pavement surface the relationship between them is expressed as 10 m 2 0 0108 m 1 2 0 1914 m 1 0 0192 r 2 0 9917 where m1 and m2 are the weight of clogging materials on the pavement surface g and the weight of clogging particles retained in the pavement g respectively as the weight of clogging materials on the pavement surface increases the weight of clogging particles in the pavement rises in a quadratic function 4 6 impact of pavement structure on clogging fig 21 a shows comparison between clogging development in the single layer and double layer porous asphalt pavements it is obvious that the clogging curves in both single and double layer porous asphalt pavements are similar it has negligible influence on clogging rate of particles in the pavement the cumulative weight of clogging particles in the single layer porous asphalt pavement reaches up to 0 43g with respect to 0 28g in the double layer porous pavement hence compared to single layer porous asphalt pavement the clogging rate is lowered by 1 5 and the weight of clogging particles is reduced by 34 in the double layer porous asphalt pavement fig 21 b demonstrates the distribution frequency of clogging particles in the single and double layer porous asphalt pavement it is observed that the particles with size of 0 075 1 18 mm are easily entrapped in the single layer porous asphalt pavement while the particles with size of 0 075 0 6 mm tend to settle in the double layer porous asphalt pavement this implies smaller particles are attached in the double layer porous asphalt pavement which are easily removed by vacuuming cleaning technique moreover the clogging ratio of particles in the single layer porous asphalt pavement is higher than that in the double layer porous asphalt pavement thus the double layer porous asphalt pavement is benefit to anticlog particles 4 7 degradation model of air voids after clogging to explore the effect of clogging on degradation of air voids structure the virtual clogging test was performed on the double layer porous asphalt pavement under gravity and or water flow in this test approximate 300g of particles were sprinkled over the surface of the specimen the voids reduction percentage η in the specimen was calculated as follows 11 η 1 n i d i 3 n k d k 3 where ni is the ball numbers of clogging particles with different particle sizes retained in the specimen di is particle size of retained clogging materials nk is the ball numbers of air voids before the clogging test dk is the ball diameter of air voids during the modeling the volume of clogging particles with different sizes in the pores of the specimen was calculated based on eq 13 the change in weight of clogging particles retained in the specimen with time was recorded according to eq 14 the voids reduction in the double layer porous asphalt pavement under gravity and or water flow with time corresponding to that in the sunny and rainy days was characterized as shown in fig 22 it is noticed that degradation of air voids exhibits consistent trend with the clogging development in the porous pavement in the sunny day air voids content of the specimen is reduced by 0 8 while in rainy day air voids volume of the specimen is deteriorated by 0 55 compared with that in sunny day air voids reduction of the specimen in rainy day is lower than 31 this implies the double layer porous asphalt pavement could maintain functionality in the rainy days with a longer service life 5 conclusions this study employed a dem cfd coupling model to evaluate clogging of the double layer porous asphalt pavement considering the climate air voids of the pavement flow rate mass of clogging materials and pavement structure furthermore the degradation of air voids in the double layer porous asphalt pavement after clogging is predicted the following conclusions can be derived from the results of this study 1 the verified dem cfd modeling revealed that the clogging process in the double layer porous asphalt pavement is divided into four stages under rainfall clogging materials are concentrated in the upper layer and particles in a size range of 0 075 0 60 mm are uniformly distributed in the double layer porous asphalt pavement 2 clogging rate is increased in the rainy day compared to the sunny day as air voids air voids in the upper layer of the pavement flow rate and mass of clogging materials rises clogging rate is enhanced 3 in comparison with the single layer porous asphalt pavement the cumulative weight of particles is reduced by 34 in the double layer porous asphalt pavement moreover smaller particles are trapped in the double layer porous asphalt pavement 4 due to clogging air voids in the double layer porous asphalt pavement is deteriorated by 0 8 in sunny day and 0 55 in rainy day the main recommendation of this article is that in order to produce the porous asphalt pavement that is less susceptible to clogging under rainfall first air voids in the upper layer of the pavement and the mass of clogging materials should be controlled appropriately moreover the exact clogging of the pavement depends on clogging materials and local climate the findings in this study facilitate the design of the double layer porous asphalt pavement with remarkable environmental benefits further study will be devoted to the effect of wind and pumping between vehicle tires and asphalt road material types and pavement thickness on the clogging of porous pavement furthermore further study will address the impact of air void reduction on permeability of the pavement and the incorporation of clogging life of porous pavement into the mechanistic empirical pavement design procedures credit authorship contribution

4803,with the increasing awareness of the environmental challenges the porous asphalt pavement has shown greater interests in terms of stormwater management underground water quality improvement mitigation of heat island effect and reduction of traffic noise however these environmental benefits will deteriorate once the porous asphalt pavement is clogged by particles the aim of this study was using the discrete element method coupled with computational fluid dynamics dem cfd model to numerically reveal the clogging development in the porous asphalt pavement under rainfall considering the climate air voids of the pavement flow rate mass of clogging materials and pavement structure the degradation of air voids in the double layer porous asphalt pavement under gravity and or rainfall was predicted the results demonstrated that the clogging evolves through four stages namely rapid clogging slow clogging partial recovery and clogging stability in the pavement under rainfall the effects of the climate air voids mass of clogging materials and pavement structure on the clogging development are significant flow rate imposes negligible effect on clogging evolution in the porous pavement all factors induce impacts on clogging rate and the distribution frequency of clogging particles in the pavement additionally after clogging air voids in the double layer porous asphalt pavement is reduced by 0 8 in the sunny days and 0 55 in the rainy days the findings in this study contribute to the design and maintenance of the double layer porous asphalt pavement with superior environmental

sustainable pavement which features a high interconnected air voids volume of 20 or higher and allows water to percolate promptly imran et al 2013 accordingly it provides significant environmental benefits including the reduction of the stormwater runoff quantity improvement of water quality enhancement of skid resistance and driving safety mitigation of heat island effect and reduction of traffic noise asaeda and ca 2000 li et al 2013a alber et al 2018a starke et al 2010 compared to porous cement pavement and porous polyurethane pavement porous asphalt pavement shows lower cost and better maintenance conventional porous asphalt pavement consists of a single layer porous asphalt mixture having a thickness of 40 70 mm isenring et al 1990 mcgovern et al 2011 tan et al 2004 shimeno et al 2010 which has been widely implemented over the world for instance 67 of the existing road surface in japan is paved with porous asphalt concrete and the single layer porous asphalt pavement is claimed to be in good state after 15 years service takahashi 2013 over 90 of major highways in the netherlands are constructed with porous asphalt mixture zhang et al 2016 the material known as open graded friction course has been used in various states of the united states alvarez et al 2010 2011 martin et al 2013 however due to thin layer the single layer porous asphalt pavement has limited improvement of performance functions insufficient mechanical strength road maintenance issues in winter and pore blockage the double layer porous asphalt pavement was proposed in japan and some european counties to facilitate greater capacity for water infiltration and storage road safety moderation of heat island effect and sound absorption van bochove 1996 hamzah et al 2013 the top layer of the double layer porous asphalt pavement is composed of finer aggregates with small air voids and the bottom layer embraces coarser aggregates with large air void ratios typically basalt and limestone are extensively used as coarse and fine aggregates in asphalt mixture respectively ding et al 2019a zhu et al 2020a chen et al 2020 the air voids in the two layers are connected to ensure the drainage of rain water and act as mitigation tubes which could absorb noise energy and thermal energy the top later is designed to prevent clogging and pavement material loosing and lost which occur in a single layer porous asphalt thus the double layer porous asphalt pavement with thick layer of porous asphalt could greatly improves the pavement functionality tang et al 2020a 2020b clogging of the interconnected air voids is the key issue associated with the sustainability of porous asphalt pavement which occurs when fine particles block the pores and consequently weakens the drainage capacity skid resistance and sound absorption properties of the pavement chu and fwa 2019 yong et al 2013 clogging material is usually a mixture of dust residual soil the wearing materials of the road s surface and vehicle tires and the surrounding vegetation martin et al 2013 to tackle the problem of pore clogging some methods have developed to maintain the permeability function of the pavement including moistening followed by sweeping sweeping followed by suction suction alone and high pressure water jects combined with simultaneous suction razzaghmanesh and beecham 2018 several different methods have been applied to investigate the clogging of porous pavement from experiments and numerical simulations xie et al 2019 razzaghmanesh and beecham 2018 alber et al 2018b 2019 concerning experiments as clogging contribute significantly to the permeability loss of porous pavement the infiltration capacity of porous mixture is measured with different methods including single ring and double ring infiltrometers dougherty et al 2011 li et al 2013b and permeameters ranieri et al 2012 garcia et al 2020 particularly falling head and constant head permeameters are the most widely used devices for permeability measurements on porous pavement due to their simplicity and the limitations induced by the measurements in situ ranieri et al 2012 garcia et al 2019 fwa et al 2002 2015 to consider more realistic and accurate conditions these infiltration experiments are carried out with the aid of rainfall simulators andres valeri et al 2016 additionally by using 3d computed tomography images the relationship between the internal structure and the properties of a permeable concrete after clogging was analyzed coleri et al 2013 kayhanian et al 2012 zhang et al 2018a however these approaches were implemented on the opaque asphalt mixture and the final properties of porous pavement after clogging were evaluated as a result the clogging development of porous pavement needs to be explored numerical simulation is a promising approach to explore the pore clogging behavior of porous systems among numerical methods discrete element method dem was proposed to study the interaction between assemblies of discrete particles based on newton s second law and finite difference scheme it is a promising approach to study behaviors of asphalt mixture including stiffness abbas et al 2007 fatigue carmona et al 2007 fracture kim et al 2008 dynamic shear modulus zhang et al 2019a 2019b 2003 you and buttlar 2006 rutting ma et al 2018 tong et al 2020 and high temperature creep ma et al 2016a dem modeling is also employed to construct aggregates with various shapes and angularities yang et al 2016 ding et al 2017 2019b zhang et al 2019c and to evaluate the influence of size non deformability and shape of aggregate on performance of asphalt mixture zhang et al 2003 2014 huang et al 2014 furthermore dem simulation is performed to reconstruct air void structures in asphalt concrete and investigate influence of air voids structure on rutting high temperature creep behavior and fatigue life of asphalt mixture ma et al 2016a 2016c zhang et al 2018b zhu et al 2020b more importantly to study the permeability of porous concrete pieralisi et al 2017 developed and validated advanced discrete element method coupled with computational fluid dynamics dem cfd model zhang et al 2018c employed the dem cfd model to numerically confirm the pore clogging mechanism and clogging development in porous pavement taking into account of the pavement porosity sediments size distribution horizontal runoff velocity and seepage velocity however few studies have devoted to the clogging mechanism in the double layer porous asphalt pavement by performing dem cfd simulation this study aims to reveal the clogging mechanism in the double layer porous asphalt pavement using three dimensional dem cfd model which is implemented in pfc3d with dem modeling the virtual double layer porous asphalt pavement was reconstructed the virtual clogging test is performed on the porous asphalt pavement under gravity and or water flow the most critical factors that impacts clogging process i e the climate air voids of asphalt pavement flow rate mass of clogging materials and pavement structure were discussed furthermore dem cfd numerical model is employed to predict degradation of air voids in the double layer porous asphalt pavement during the clogging process fig 1 illustrates research plan in this study 2 experimental 2 1 materials three types of porous asphalt mixtures with target porosities of 20 22 and 20 were prepared in the laboratory based on marshall mix design method ministry of transport of the people s republic of china 2004 namely pac10 pac16 and pac13 high viscosity asphalt was used in pacs and its properties are summarized in table 1 basalt and limestone aggregate were utilized in pac10 and pac16 respectively while basalt aggregate was added in pac13 the properties of aggregates are listed in table 2 and the gradations for three pacs are shown in fig 2 table 3 illustrates the composition of three porous asphalt mixtures is summarized high viscosity asphalt with content of 4 92 4 50 and 4 92 was utilized in pac10 pac16 and pac13 respectively aggregates with nominal maximum aggregate sizes of 10 mm 16 mm and 16 mm were incorporated into pac10 pac16 and pac16 respectively 2 2 fabrication of double layer porous asphalt pavement in the field double layer porous asphalt pavement could be laid and compacted through hot on hot and hot on cold methods in the hot on hot technique both bottom and top pac layers are laid and paved simultaneously in the hot on cold process the bottom coarser pac layer was placed and compacted first and the top finer pac layer was laid and compacted at a later time it was found that the holt on cold technique generates core specimens which are less permeable compared to specimens by the hot on hot method hamzah 2007 in this study the double layer porous asphalt pavement specimen consisted of 25 mm pac10 and 40 mm pac16 was prepared by following the procedure pac16 with thickness of 40 mm was firstly placed at the bottom of the mold pac10 with thickness of 25 mm was then put on the surface of pac16 both pacs were simultaneously compacted into the double layer porous asphalt pavement specimen as shown in fig 3 2 3 characterization of clogging materials the clogging materials used in this study was collected from surface runoff of the local double layer porous asphalt pavement with a long service life the runoff solution was dried and then analyzed by gradation test which is detailed in table 4 it is noted that the clogging materials are composed of 9 particles larger than 2 36 mm 56 sand with dimension between 0 075 2 36 mm and 35 residual soil and dust particles smaller than 0 075 mm 2 4 laboratory clogging experiment a rectangular specimen with dimension of 60 mm 60 mm 65 mm was prepared by core drilling from the double layer porous asphalt pavement specimen the laboratory clogging test was performed on this specimen as described below 1 the sample was covered with transparent tape in the surrounding sides and then placed in the rainfall simulation apparatus shown in fig 4 a rainfall simulator was located on top of pavement the gap between the specimen and the sample container was filled with epoxy glue to ensure waterproof 2 approximately 1g of clogging particles were sprinkled evenly over the top surface of the sample 3 500 ml of water was injected into the tank the drain water was collected at the bottom of the specimen and dried in the oven which was weighted as b 4 after drying the specimen the remaining particles on the surface of the specimen were collected with weight of c 5 the sieving test was performed on the dried particles collected from the runoff and surface of the specimen 6 the cumulative weight of clogging materials in the specimen was calculated by 10 b c at each sieve size 3 discrete element simulation 3 1 generation of coarse aggregates by developing a specific modeling algorithm in pfc3d ma et al 2016 2018 three dimensional irregular coarse aggregates larger than 2 36 mm were generated as follows 1 the realistic shape of a coarse aggregates is captured by a 3d scanner as shown in fig 5 a 2 based on greyscale analysis of the images the three dimensional skeleton of coarse aggregates was obtained as shown in fig 5 b 3 the discrete ball elements with different sizes were generated to fill into the gap of the aggregate skeleton and the virtual coarse aggregates with irregular shapes close to the realistic shapes were built as shown in fig 5 c by repeating the procedure the virtual aggregates with different shapes and sizes were formed as shown in fig 6 table 5 shows the average volume of aggregates in response to different sizes finally physical and mechanical parameters e g density young s modulus poisson s ratio and friction coefficient were accredited to coarse aggregates thus a virtual three dimensional coarse aggregate database was established 3 2 reconstruction of the single layer and double layer porous asphalt pavements based on discretized modeling the microstructure of asphalt mixture consisted of coarse aggregates asphalt mastic asphalt binder and fine aggregates smaller than 2 36 mm and air voids was reconstructed the following procedure was taken to reconstruct the virtual double layer asphalt pavement specimen having 25 mm pac10 and 40 mm pac16 for top and bottom layers 1 a virtual steel mold with two layers was generated with the diameter of 100 mm and heights of 50 mm and 80 mm for the top and bottom layers as shown in fig 7 a 2 coarse aggregates with designed gradation were selected from the virtual aggregate database and poured into the virtual mold as shown in fig 7 b aggregate pebbles with blue and green colors were placed in the top and bottom layers of the mold respectively 3 asphalt mastic was represented by discrete ball elements with radius of 1 mm the volume of asphalt mastic was calculated based on mix design of asphalt mixture and then incorporated into the aggregate volume as shown in fig 7 c 4 the dynamic movement controlled by a complex algorithm was applied to compact the specimen and the virtual double layer asphalt mixture specimen with diameter of 100 mm and height of 65 mm was reconstructed as shown in fig 7 d 5 to generate air voids the balls with radius of 0 5 mm were regularly arranged and filled into the space in the specimen when the ball was in contact with all ball units of asphalt mastic and pebbles of coarse aggregates the ball was deleted and the remaining balls indicated air voids to reduce the impact of the mold edge air voids were generated in the center area of the specimen with dimension of 60 mm 60 mm 65 mm as shown in fig 8 e the red particles represent air voids in the specimen the two dimensional porosity of the specimen was calculated by the equation 1 vv i n i 60 60 where vv i is the porosity at the ith layer n i is the number of red balls indicating air voids fig 8 shows the distribution of pavement porosity with depth it is observed that the pavement porosity exhibits a smooth transition between the top layer and bottom layer of the specimen the average porosity in the top and bottom layers of the virtual specimen was found to be 18 99 and 21 03 respectively which were consistent with the designed air voids of 20 and 22 in the laboratory specimen respectively hence the microstructure of the virtual double layer porous asphalt pavement specimen was verified in order to further simplify this model the original balls of asphalt mastic and aggregates were eliminated while the balls of air voids were retained in the rectangular specimen then the balls with radius of 0 5 mm were regularly arranged and reloaded in the specimen which indicate homogeneous asphalt mixture if the ball units of asphalt mixture and the balls of air voids were overlapped the ball units were deleted the remaining is the reconstructed specimen with uniform ball units as shown in fig 9 a to prevent the infiltration of dust particles into the gap between ball units of asphalt mixture the virtual specimen is encrypted firstly the balls with radius of r were generated and regularly arranged in the specimen which represent the encryption units r 2 1 r 2 where r is half of the distance between two contacting ball units of asphalt mixture then if the encryption unit and the ball unit of air void was in contact the encryption unit was deleted the remaining structure was encrypted specimen as shown in fig 9 b as shown in fig 10 c the blue red and yellow balls represent asphalt mixture air voids and encryption units it is obvious that the encryption units only exist between the ball units of asphalt mixture by performing the procedure described above the virtual single layer porous asphalt pavement was also reconstructed with dem simulation 3 3 modeling of clogging materials the balls with different sizes were utilized to represent clogging materials in pfc3d it is assumed that 1g of clogging material with density of 2 7 g cm3 was poured into the virtual specimen the median of two adjacent sieve sizes was regarded as the average particle size based on gradation of clogging materials the ball number of particles at each size was calculated as shown in table 2 the balls with a series of sizes and numbers were applied on the upper face of the rectangular specimen as shown in fig 10 the balls with unique color indicate each size appropriate micromechanical contact models are incorporated after the microstructure modeling of the specimen pfc3d provides four basic models of micro constitutive contacts including burger s model stiffness model bonding model and slip model itasca consulting group 2004 stiffness model was utilized to describe micromechanical contacts between clogging materials and contacts between clogging materials and asphalt specimen the elastic modulus poison ratio and friction coefficient of both constituents were set to be 70 0 gpa 0 18 and 0 5 respectively 3 4 modeling of the virtual clogging test under gravity in the sunny day clogging material enters pores in asphalt pavement with the wind and pumping between vehicle tires and asphalt road dem modeling is performed to simulate clogging in the porous asphalt pavement under gravity which corresponds to that in the sunny day in the virtual clogging test the gravity field g 9 8 n m2 was applied to the specimen the ball units of asphalt mixture were assigned with velocity and angular velocity of 0 which kept static in the clogging test the ball units of clogging material collided with the static balls of asphalt mixture which were moving in the specimen the trajectory of the moving clogging material was recorded every 50000 timesteps the clogging test was stopped when the volume of clogging particles entrapped in the specimen reached constant fig 11 illustrates distribution of clogging materials in the double layer porous asphalt pavement as can be noted in fig 11 a clogging is formed on the pavement surface fig 11 b demonstrates that larger particles with purple and brown colors are entrapped in the upper of the specimen while smaller particles are broadly distributed in the upper and middle layers of the specimen a closer inspection of the clogging in fig 11 c shows that the clogging materials are accumulated in the porous asphalt pavement in three ways 1 smaller particles are accumulated in the void spaces of porous pavement 2 smaller particles trap larger particles 3 fine particles are accumulated firstly and larger particles are then assembled the last two ways were more commonly observed thus the clogging in the porous asphalt pavement under gravity is primarily attributed to the accumulation of larger particles 3 5 dem cfd modeling of the virtual clogging test under gravity and water flow during and after rain events the particles on the pavement surface are carried by rainwater contributing to the clogging of voids in the pavement in this study the virtual clogging test under rainfall was conducted on the porous pavement by the dem cfd two way coupling method the cfd model in pfc3d solved the particle fluid interaction based on the volume averaged coarse meshing method in the fluid in each fluid unit the force by the fluid is distributed to each particle meanwhile porosity and fluid drag force in the fluid unit were calculated from characteristics of particles the two way coupling was realized by timely exchanging information between pfc and fluid solver the motion of particle is described by standard equations in pfc3d which considers the particle fluid interaction force 3 u t f mech f fluid m g the symbols u m g denote the particle weight particle mass and gravitational acceleration the term fmech is the external force of the particles including applied force and contact force the term ffluid is the total force that the fluid applied on the particles it is the sum of fluid drag force and the force due to the fluid pressure gradient the fluid drag force stemming from the difference between particle and fluid velocities depends on how the porosity is calculated it is defined as 4 f drag f 0 x where f0 is the drag force applied on single particle is porosity of the fluid cell x is empirical coefficient which ensures the fluid drag force is suitable to the fluid with high and low porosity and supports a wide range of reynolds numbers the drag force that single particle is subjected to is given by 5 f 0 1 2 c d ρ f π r 2 u v u v where c d ρ f r u and v are the drag force coefficient fluid density radius of the particle fluid velocity and particle velocity the drag force coefficient cd is a function of the particle reynolds number rep 6 c d 0 63 4 8 r e p the empirical coefficient x is expressed as 7 x 3 7 0 65 e x p 1 5 log 10 r e p 2 2 the reynolds number is calculated by 8 r e p 2 ρ f r u v μ f where μ f is the dynamic viscous coefficient of the fluid in each fluid unit porosity body force fb fluid velocity v fluid pressure p the fluid pressure gradient p fluid density ρ f and dynamic viscous coefficient of the fluid μ f were determined by pfc3d software the body force fb is written as 9 f b f drag v where v is the volume of fluid unit the procedure of dem cfd simulation is illustrated in fig 12 the fluid was meshed by walls ensuring that asphalt pavement and clogging material were embraced in the cell the rainfall was applied on the specimen at a rate of 0 015 m s water flowed in the top of the specimen with dimension of 60 mm 60 mm and was discharged into the wall space at the bottom of the specimen with dimension of 50 mm 50 mm other boundaries of the specimen were impervious gravity was also applied in the dem cfd simulation to investigate clogging of porous asphalt pavement under water flow and gravity as shown in fig 13 3 6 the simulation cases as shown in table 6 the varied parameter of case 1 is the climate involving sunny day and rainy day which were controlled by dem simulation under gravity and or water flow case 2 4 is air voids flow rate and mass of clogging materials the case 5 compares the clogging between the single and double layer porous asphalt pavement which was constructed by pac13 and pac10 pac16 respectively the computational time step designed for the fluid is 5 0 10 4 s and for the particles is 5 0 10 6 s the relationship of the cumulative weight of clogging particles with time was acquired to reveal the clogging development in the porous asphalt pavement the ratio of the clogging particles number in the specimen to the total number of clogging particles is characterized as clogging ratio the influences of climate air voids flow rate mass of clogging materials and pavement structure on the clogging development and clogging ratio of particles in the porous asphalt pavement will be described below furthermore degradation of air voids in the double layer porous asphalt pavement after clogging was predicted 4 results and discussion 4 1 verification of the virtual clogging test both laboratory and virtual clogging tests were performed on the double layer porous asphalt pavement under similar condition fig 14 shows comparison in clogging ratio between experimental and simulation results under gravity and water flow based on experimental results it is observed that 0 30mm clogging particles present highest clogging ratio while 0 075mm clogging particles show lowest clogging ratio among the clogging particles this is attributed to that the clogging characteristics are affected by the porosity and sizes of air voids in porous asphalt pavement furthermore it is also noticed that the difference between experimental and simulation results are within 3 4 which is acceptable thus the virtual clogging test by dem cfd simulation is verified 4 2 impact of weather on clogging fig 15 a displays the clogging development in the double layer porous asphalt pavement under gravity and or water flow which correspond to that in the sunny and rainy days it is noticed that in sunny day or under gravity the clogging in porous pavement experiences three stages rapid clogging stage slow clogging stage and stable clogging stage before 1 65s a number of smaller particles enter void spaces in the porous asphalt pavement contributing to increasing in accumulated weight of clogging particles with the blockage of air channels the clogging rate is reduced resulting in slow clogging stage after 1 65s fraction of particles in the pavement tends to be saturated leading to the stable clogging stage on the other hand in rainy day or under gravity and water flow the clogging development is divided into four stages rapid clogging stage slow clogging stage mitigation of clogging stage and stable clogging stage the clogging weight increases rapidly and slowly increases before 0 28s and then falls down slight and finally tend to be stable after 1 0s with the continuous supply of particles source the weight of clogging particles in the porous asphalt pavement increases then decreases and finally tends to be saturated the reduction in mass of clogging particles is attributed to the infiltration of fine particles with water flow the change in cumulative weight of clogging particles in the rapid clogging stage is characterized as rate of clogging the clogging rate is 0 21 g s and 1 33 g s for the clogging of the pavement in the sunny and rainy day respectively furthermore the weight of particles accumulated in the porous pavement is up to 0 40g and 0 28g in the sunny day and rainy day respectively thus in comparison with clogging in the sunny day clogging rate is enhanced by 6 4 times and the cumulative weight of clogging particle is reduced by 30 in the rainy day fig 15 b shows the change in cumulative mass of clogging particles in the upper and lower layers of the specimen with time the clogging development in the upper layer is similar to that in the whole porous pavement the particles initially percolate into the upper layer which leads to the increase in weight of clogging particles in this layer rapidly and peak value after 0 28s then the conglomerated particles in the upper layer transport downward to the lower layer it leads to the increase in mass of clogging particles in the lower layer at 0 5s the mass of particles entrapped in the lower layer reaches the maximum value then the particles infiltrate with simulated rainfall resulting in the decrease in particle weight in the lower layer finally clogging materials in the upper and lower layers stop moving resulting in constant weight of clogging particles in the specimen it is noticed that the ultimate weight of particles in the upper and lower layers of the specimen is approximately 0 25g and 0 03g respectively as a result the particles are concentrated in the upper layer of the double layer porous asphalt pavement which is almost 8 3 times more than that in the lower layer of the pavement fig 16 displays the relationship between the clogging ratio and particle size it can be observed that particles smaller than 0 075 mm cause rapid clogging steady clogging mitigation of clogging and steady clogging in the porous pavement while particles with the size of 0 15 0 6 mm induce rapid clogging and steady clogging particles that are bigger than 0 60 mm cause none or less clogging at 1s the clogging ratio reaches up to 36 37 38 36 and 0 corresponding to 0 075 mm 0 15 mm 0 30 mm 0 60 mm and 1 18 mm particles respectively obviously particles in a size range of 0 075 0 60 mm accumulate uniformly within the double layer porous asphalt pavement this is because smaller particles easily get trapped while larger particles are difficult to migrate and thus blocked outside of the pavement for this reason to design anticlogging porous asphalt mixture the first step would be to determine the sizes of the clogging materials in service location and then design the mixture with the highest sieve grading efficiency for that clogging materials 4 3 impact of air voids on clogging fig 17 a shows the variation of the clogging development in the double layer porous asphalt pavement with a series of air voids i e 20 24 in the upper layer and 22 in the lower layer of the pavement as can be noted the clogging curves of porous pavement exhibit consistent trend between different air voids which involves rapid clogging slow clogging mitigation of clogging and steady clogging stage the weight of particles reaches the peak value at 0 28s which is 0 33g 0 37g and 0 48g when the porosity of the upper layer is 20 22 and 24 respectively correspondingly the ultimate weight of particles retained in the specimen is 0 28g 0 32g 0 43g respectively thus as air voids increase from 20 to 24 the clogging rate and the cumulated weight of particles in the pavement is increased by 36 and 53 respectively fig 17 b illustrates the clogging development in the upper and lower layers of the double layer porous asphalt pavement with different air voids it is found that air voids impose higher impact on clogging in the upper layer than that in the lower layer of the specimen the cumulated weight of clogging materials in the upper layer of the specimen is up to 0 25g 0 30g 0 40g for air voids of 20 22 and 24 respectively the corresponding value in the lower layer of the specimen is 0 03g 0 02g and 0 03g respectively accordingly as air voids rise from 20 to 22 58 more particles are conglomerated in the upper layer of the double layer porous asphalt pavement fig 17 c illustrates the change in distribution frequency of the clogging particles with air voids it can be seen that clogging ratio depends on both particle size and air voids in the pavement considering the upper layer having air voids of 20 particles with size of 0 075 0 6 mm are uniformly distributed in the porous pavement given air voids of 22 and 24 particles with size of 0 15 mm are highly accumulated in the system meanwhile a small amount of 1 18 mm particles is concentrated in the pavement with air voids of 24 when increasing air voids of the upper layer from 20 to 24 the clogging ratio is increased by 15 47 12 and 17 for 0 075 mm 0 15 mm 0 3 mm 1 18 mm particles respectively whereas it is decreased by 11 for 0 6 mm particles thus to enhance anticlogging capacity it is suggested to control air voids of the upper layer in the double layer porous asphalt pavement 4 4 impact of flow rate on clogging fig 18 a shows the change in clogging development in the double layer porous asphalt pavement with flow rates it is noted that flow rate has no impact on four stages in the clogging development of the pavement while high flow rate accelerates the clogging rate of particles in the pavement the ultimate weight of clogging particle is 0 28g at 1 0s 0 26g at 0 9s and 0 26g at 0 7s in response to flow rate of 0 01 m s 0 015 m s and 0 02 m s respectively thus as flow rate increases from 0 01 m s to 0 02 m s a nearly 2 fold increase in clogging rate is recorded and 5 less particles are attached in the pavement fig 18 b displays the change in clogging development in the upper and lower layer of the pavement with flow rate in the upper layer of the porous pavement the ultimate weight of clogging particles turns into 0 25g at 0 8s 0 26g at 0 4s 0 26g at 0 3s when flow rate is 0 01 m s 0 015 m s and 0 02 m s respectively the corresponding value in the lower layer of the porous pavement is 0 03g at 1 0s 0 003g at 0 9s 0 002g at 0 7s respectively similarly flow rate has negligible impact on the cumulative weight of clogging particles in the upper layer of the pavement the weight of clogging particles in the lower layer of the pavement is slightly reduced as flow rate increases this might be due to the fact that more particles pass through the lower layer of the pavement as flow rate increases fig 18 c shows the change in distribution frequency of clogging particles in the porous pavement with flow rate it is noted that the particles in the size range of 0 075 0 6 mm are trapped in the pavement under various flow rates with flow rate of 0 01 m s particles in the size range of 0 075 0 6 mm are uniformly distributed in the pavement given flow rate of 0 02 m s 0 6 mm particles are mainly concentrated in the pavement hence as flow rate increases larger particles are accumulated in the pavement although the total cumulative weight of clogging materials is not affected 4 5 impact of mass of clogging materials on clogging fig 19 a shows the change in clogging development in the double layer porous asphalt pavement with mass of clogging materials it is evident that the cumulative weight of clogging particles in the porous asphalt pavement increases with mass of clogging materials the ultimate weight of particles in the pavement is 0 28g 0 81g and 1 22g when dosing particles of 1 7g 3 4g and 5 1g respectively the time that clogging reaches steady stage is negligibly affected by the weight of clogging particles accordingly as mass of clogging materials increases from 1 7g to 5 1g the clogging rate and cumulative weight of particles are nearly raised by 2 3 and 4 4 times respectively fig 19 b displays the cumulative weight of particles in the upper and lower layers of the pavement with different mass of clogging materials it is obvious that mass of clogging materials imposes significant effect on the cumulative weight of particle in the upper layer of the pavement and slight influence on that in the lower layer of the pavement with the increased clogging particles from 1 7g to 5 1g the cumulative weight of particles in the upper layer is increased from 0 25g to 1 15g with a nearly 4 6 times enhancement fig 19 c shows the variation in distribution frequency of clogging particles in the porous pavement with mass of clogging materials it is noted that the particles in the size range of 0 075 0 6 mm uniformly invade the porous pavement when dosing 1 7g clogging particles when adding 5 1g particles the particles in the size range of 0 075 1 18 mm are settled in the pavement thus high amounts of clogging particles allow the accumulation of larger particles fig 20 displays the variation of weight of clogging particles retained in the pores of the specimen with the weight of clogging materials on the pavement surface the relationship between them is expressed as 10 m 2 0 0108 m 1 2 0 1914 m 1 0 0192 r 2 0 9917 where m1 and m2 are the weight of clogging materials on the pavement surface g and the weight of clogging particles retained in the pavement g respectively as the weight of clogging materials on the pavement surface increases the weight of clogging particles in the pavement rises in a quadratic function 4 6 impact of pavement structure on clogging fig 21 a shows comparison between clogging development in the single layer and double layer porous asphalt pavements it is obvious that the clogging curves in both single and double layer porous asphalt pavements are similar it has negligible influence on clogging rate of particles in the pavement the cumulative weight of clogging particles in the single layer porous asphalt pavement reaches up to 0 43g with respect to 0 28g in the double layer porous pavement hence compared to single layer porous asphalt pavement the clogging rate is lowered by 1 5 and the weight of clogging particles is reduced by 34 in the double layer porous asphalt pavement fig 21 b demonstrates the distribution frequency of clogging particles in the single and double layer porous asphalt pavement it is observed that the particles with size of 0 075 1 18 mm are easily entrapped in the single layer porous asphalt pavement while the particles with size of 0 075 0 6 mm tend to settle in the double layer porous asphalt pavement this implies smaller particles are attached in the double layer porous asphalt pavement which are easily removed by vacuuming cleaning technique moreover the clogging ratio of particles in the single layer porous asphalt pavement is higher than that in the double layer porous asphalt pavement thus the double layer porous asphalt pavement is benefit to anticlog particles 4 7 degradation model of air voids after clogging to explore the effect of clogging on degradation of air voids structure the virtual clogging test was performed on the double layer porous asphalt pavement under gravity and or water flow in this test approximate 300g of particles were sprinkled over the surface of the specimen the voids reduction percentage η in the specimen was calculated as follows 11 η 1 n i d i 3 n k d k 3 where ni is the ball numbers of clogging particles with different particle sizes retained in the specimen di is particle size of retained clogging materials nk is the ball numbers of air voids before the clogging test dk is the ball diameter of air voids during the modeling the volume of clogging particles with different sizes in the pores of the specimen was calculated based on eq 13 the change in weight of clogging particles retained in the specimen with time was recorded according to eq 14 the voids reduction in the double layer porous asphalt pavement under gravity and or water flow with time corresponding to that in the sunny and rainy days was characterized as shown in fig 22 it is noticed that degradation of air voids exhibits consistent trend with the clogging development in the porous pavement in the sunny day air voids content of the specimen is reduced by 0 8 while in rainy day air voids volume of the specimen is deteriorated by 0 55 compared with that in sunny day air voids reduction of the specimen in rainy day is lower than 31 this implies the double layer porous asphalt pavement could maintain functionality in the rainy days with a longer service life 5 conclusions this study employed a dem cfd coupling model to evaluate clogging of the double layer porous asphalt pavement considering the climate air voids of the pavement flow rate mass of clogging materials and pavement structure furthermore the degradation of air voids in the double layer porous asphalt pavement after clogging is predicted the following conclusions can be derived from the results of this study 1 the verified dem cfd modeling revealed that the clogging process in the double layer porous asphalt pavement is divided into four stages under rainfall clogging materials are concentrated in the upper layer and particles in a size range of 0 075 0 60 mm are uniformly distributed in the double layer porous asphalt pavement 2 clogging rate is increased in the rainy day compared to the sunny day as air voids air voids in the upper layer of the pavement flow rate and mass of clogging materials rises clogging rate is enhanced 3 in comparison with the single layer porous asphalt pavement the cumulative weight of particles is reduced by 34 in the double layer porous asphalt pavement moreover smaller particles are trapped in the double layer porous asphalt pavement 4 due to clogging air voids in the double layer porous asphalt pavement is deteriorated by 0 8 in sunny day and 0 55 in rainy day the main recommendation of this article is that in order to produce the porous asphalt pavement that is less susceptible to clogging under rainfall first air voids in the upper layer of the pavement and the mass of clogging materials should be controlled appropriately moreover the exact clogging of the pavement depends on clogging materials and local climate the findings in this study facilitate the design of the double layer porous asphalt pavement with remarkable environmental benefits further study will be devoted to the effect of wind and pumping between vehicle tires and asphalt road material types and pavement thickness on the clogging of porous pavement furthermore further study will address the impact of air void reduction on permeability of the pavement and the incorporation of clogging life of porous pavement into the mechanistic empirical pavement design procedures credit authorship contribution

4804,human activities have a strong influence on the hydrological cycle altering natural patterns of evapotranspiration soil infiltration capacity ice cover groundwater distribution and ultimately streamflow at different spatio temporal scales yet modelling human activities and the associated impacts are often given a secondary importance in hydrological models with respect to the high fidelity characterization of natural processes especially at the catchment scale while this has little or no influence on model accuracy when modelling pristine watersheds it remarkably deteriorates the model performance in river basins with a considerable anthropogenic footprint operations of water infrastructures within a watershed e g a dam or a diversion dam are commonly modelled based on observational data when available this reproduces to some extent the historical decisions but might be inadequate to simulate operations outside of historical climate or socio economic conditions in this paper we compare a descriptive approach traditionally adopted in hydrological models where reservoir operations are determined by tracking the historical average release and a normative approach where the operations are dynamically conditioned upon the reservoir storage and can adapt to the climate and socio economic conditions influencing the reservoir operations we contrast these two approaches by assessing the reservoir dynamics and the impacts on the downstream river system across time scales from daily to seasonal we first discuss the accuracy of the two approaches in reproducing historical observations then we explore their potential in anticipating the impacts of future reservoir operations when considering climate and socio economic change scenarios thus testing the approaches in decision making contexts increasingly altered with respect to the historical one we critically present the advantages and disadvantages of either approach thus contributing to clarify the importance of adopting an appropriate approach to model reservoir operations when reconstructing past dynamics or anticipating future dynamics of catchments impacted by human activities keywords hydrological

human activities for instance several global scale hydrological models include water allocation rules to represent water withdrawals from the river network and groundwater and water distribution to different uses such as agriculture and hydropower production e g dang et al 2019 doll et al 2012 pokhrel et al 2016 wada et al 2014 focusing on reservoir operations specifically several studies have proposed approaches to include reservoir operations within state of the art hydrological models at the global scale to simulate reservoir dynamics and their effects on the hydrological cycle haddeland et al 2006 hanasaki et al 2006 wisser et al 2010 according to yassin et al 2019 the existing approaches can be divided into inflow and demand based methods and target storage and release based methods methods belonging to the first group define reservoir release as a function of reservoir inflow and demand while methods belonging to the second group aim at tracking a predefined reservoir level

descriptive approach which is a relatively simple approach representing the actual decision making process through a set of rules a more sophisticated decision making model could alternatively be achieved adopting a normative approach this is a relatively more complex approach describing the decision making process of a rational decision maker who maximizes a given utility function in this case the decisions are obtained by solving an optimization problem becker 2013 kagel and roth 2016 the adequacy of the decision making model either descriptive or normative is usually evaluated against how well the decisions observed in the past are represented unfortunately records of past decisions are often not available especially over long time periods which is key for testing the models against different decision making contexts ligtenberg et al 2010 the decision making model can then be evaluated for its theoretical adequacy i e the degree to which the conceptualization of the decision making process is acceptable or realistic mason et al 2018 in this respect both the descriptive and normative approaches have some theoretical drawbacks the data driven nature of the descriptive approach for instance could fail in anticipating possible changes in reservoir operations due to changes in decision making drivers as it could happen with climate change the normative approach on the other hand can require a large amount of data sometimes difficult to obtain to properly defining the optimization problem the assumption of full rationality underlying this approach has been widely criticized when applied to individuals kahneman et al 1991 as human behaviour is influenced by many factors such as past experience juliusson et al 2005 cognitive biases stanovich and west 2008 and personal belief acevedo and krueger 2004 nevertheless criticisms are less severe when this approach is used to represent the behaviour of group of individuals or institutions committed with pursuing a clear target e g hydropower revenue water demand satisfaction giuliani et al 2016a the normative approach is the state of the art approach in water resources management studies ahmad

surprisingly it has never been adopted in hydrology focused studies which concentrate on accurately describing the hydrological processes and assessing how hydrological dynamics respond to changes in natural drivers in this paper we thus compare a descriptive and a normative approach for simulating reservoir operations within a high resolution spatially distributed and physically explicit hydrological model to assess the adequacy of either approach in modelling catchments where the natural river network is disrupted by water diversions and reservoirs in particular we clarify the assumptions of each modelling approach and discuss their advantages and disadvantages we compare the descriptive and normative approach by conducting a retrospective analysis over historical observations and a scenario based analysis in the retrospective analysis we assess the accuracy of the modelling approaches in reproducing the observed reservoir operations and the impact on downstream hydrological regimes in the scenario based analysis we assess the capability of the two approaches in anticipating future impacts of climate and socio economic scenarios different from the historical ones in particular we focus on assessing the range of flow variability downstream from the reservoir the comparison between the two approaches is performed on the lake como catchment in northern italy where the interaction between reservoirs and natural environment is exemplary of alpine water systems the natural river network has been heavily exploited since the 1950 s by diverting water in artificial channels and reservoirs to produce hydropower electricity this catchment as most alpine water systems is expected to be significantly influenced by future changes in both climatic i e temperature precipitation and socio economic aspects i e electricity demand and prices e g anghileri et al 2018a gaudard et al 2014 huss and hock 2018 schlecht and weigt 2015 thus representing a relevant case study for comparing the descriptive and normative modelling approaches the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a description of the study area section 3 presents the hydrological model the reservoir operations modelling approaches and their implementation for the specific case study section 4 shows the scenarios considered and the experimental setting section 6 shows the results of the comparative assessment between the descriptive and the normative approach for modelling reservoir operations finally section 7 summarizes the main findings of the paper 2 study area lake como fig 1 a is a subalpine regulated lake in northern italy with a catchment area of 4 552 km2 the lake is dominated by the mixed snow rain hydro climatic regime typical of the southern alps winter and summer are relatively dry while spring and autumn are relatively wet because of snow melt and rainfall events respectively the upper part of the catchment is heavily exploited for hydropower production by a complex system of 16 reservoirs which capture large amounts of water from their own catchments and from nearby catchments connected through artificial channels overall the reservoirs can store about 10 of he mean annual inflow to lake como and they contribute to almost 13 of the italian hydropower production their operations have altered the natural hydrological cycle as the reservoirs show an annual refill and draw down cycle which is synchronized with snow melt the timing of the beginning of the snow melt corresponds to the time when the reservoir storage is approximately empty and the refilling period starts the volume stored in spring and summer which would naturally flow downstream is instead released during the winter when the electricity demand and consequently the electricity price is usually higher denaro et al 2017 in this work we focus on the main hydropower reservoir system located in the study area fig 1b which is used as proof of concept for the comparison of the two approaches for modelling reservoir operations it is located in the upper part of the catchment see the white triangle in fig 1b and collects water over an area of about 1 000 km2 which is partly covered by glaciers through a dense network of river diversions the reservoir has a maximum storage capacity of 187 million m3 about 30 of the hydropower storage capacity of the entire lake como catchment and directly feeds a power plant with an installed capacity of 245 mw and a maximum flow of 41 06 m3 s 3 methods and models 3 1 hydrological model topkapi eth we used topkapi eth a physically explicit and fully distributed model to simulate the hydrological processes topkapi eth represents the catchment topography and a vertical discretization of the subsurface in three layers on regular grid of cells the runoff in each cell results from either infiltration or saturation excess processes or a combination thereof surface and subsurface routing is represented by a kinematic approximation of mass and momentum equation integrated on a topographic gradient the model describes the evapotranspiration processes using the priestley taylor equation priestley and taylor 1972 and snow and ice melt dynamics with a temperature index model based on shortwave radiation and air temperature carenzo et al 2009 pellicciotti et al 2005 further details about the model equations are given in fatichi et al 2015 the model inputs include temperature and precipitation time series for each grid cell at the temporal and spatial resolution selected for the model simulation also a series of spatial inputs are required to characterize the catchment features namely a digital elevation model a soil map a land cover map a map of the glacier ice thickness and a the location of the reservoirs and diversion channels for our specific case study we adopt a daily time resolution and a 250 250 m2 spatial resolution all the spatial inputs are provided by the regional agency for environmental protection arpa lombardia we use temperature and precipitation time series at the stations showed in fig 1 we used the thiessen polygons to move from point data i e station to the spatially distributed inputs required by the model temperature is adjusted to account for the elevation difference between each cell in the thiessen polygon and the corresponding gauge elevation using an adiabatic lapse rate precipitation is instead adjusted using a monthly multiplicative correction factor to account for the high spatial variability of precipitation in our study area which is characterized by a complex orography we used the alpine precipitation grid dataset in isotta et al 2014 to compute the correction factors as the ratio between the monthly precipitation in each cell in the thiessen polygon and in the cell where the gauge is located the gridded dataset has a spatial resolution of 5 km2 and results from historical records of approximately 5500 precipitation gauges over the alpine area including portions of italy switzerland austria germany france slovenia and croatia over the period 1971 2008 these factors are then applied to the precipitation time series observed in the stations topkapi eth has been widely used to simulate hydrological processes in natural catchments e g ragettli and pellicciotti 2012 as well in catchments where water is used for human activities e g costa et al 2018 finger et al 2012 fatichi et al 2015 the model in fact includes the description of water infrastructures such as reservoirs and water diversions the reservoir dynamics are based on mass balance conservation 1 s t 1 s t a t 1 e t 1 r t 1 where s t m3 represents the reservoir storage at time t and a t 1 m3 e t 1 m3 and r t 1 m3 are the total inflow to the reservoir the evaporation and the release from the reservoir occurring from t to t 1 respectively the total inflow is the sum of the water volume originated in the catchment directly drained by the reservoir the water volume diverted to the reservoir by means of artificial channels and the precipitation on the reservoir surface the artificial channels are modeled as transfer of surface water from one grid cell to another the actual amount of transferred water is regulated by two parameters the percentage of water that is transferred from the cell of origin and the maximum channel capacity the evaporation is calculated based on the time varying water volume contained in the reservoir at each time step using the priestley taylor equation the reservoir release r t 1 is defined as a function of the time t and the storage of the reservoir s t 2 r t 1 f t s t the reservoir operating rule f is defined differently depending on the modelling approach we adopt the descriptive approach is presented in section 3 2 and the normative approach in section 3 3 all the reservoir data needed to implement the two approaches are directly provided by the hydropower company however they can not be shared for confidentiality reasons we calibrated and validated topkapi eth on the period 2008 2009 and 2010 2013 respectively in order to satisfactorily reproduce the total inflow to the reservoir in particular we manually calibrated some parameters governing snow melt dynamics and soil infiltration see supplementary material a for more details we compared the net inflow i e actual inflow minus evaporation simulated using topkapi eth to the daily reservoir net inflow computed via mass balance from the available records of reservoir storage and release fig 2 a shows that the model is able to accurately reproduce the daily and seasonal inflow dynamics both in the dry and the wet season fig 2b shows that there is no systematic bias toward either over or under estimation this is reflected in the performance metrics for the calibration period 2008 2009 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is equal to 0 90 the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 is 0 94 and the root mean square error rmse is equal to 4 24 m3 s for the validation period 2010 2013 nse is equal to 0 76 kge is equal to 0 82 and rmse is equal to 5 95 m3 s fig 2c shows that the cumulative inflow is satisfactorily simulated by the model this is particularly interesting because the main function of the reservoir is to store water in water abundant periods e g spring and release it in water scarce period e g late summer winter to satisfy the electricity demand 3 2 descriptive approach for modelling reservoir operations according to the descriptive approach adopted in this study the reservoir is operated to track a given target level trajectory which represents the trajectory that the reservoir level should follow during a normal hydrological year the reservoir operating rule f is defined as 3 r t 1 0 if l t l t mod t r max l t if l t l t mod t where r t 1 m3 is the release volume from t to t 1 r max m3 is the maximum feasible release l t m is the reservoir level at time step t l t mod t m is the target level at time step t mod t the target level is defined as a periodic trajectory of period t and the notation t mod t represents the remainder of the division of t by t we consider a daily time step and an annual period i e t 365 days in our simulations the target level is thus the same for each january 1 st i e t 1 366 for a simulation starting on january 1 st january 2 nd i e t 2 367 etc in section 4 we will provide further details on how the target level is computed in our experiments the maximum feasible release depends on the reservoir level to account for spills when the reservoir level is higher than the maximum storage during normal operating conditions it is set to the maximum capacity of the power plant i e 41 06 m 3 s 3 3 normative approach for modelling reservoir operations according to the normative approach adopted in this study the reservoir operating rule f is obtained by solving an optimal control problem which conceptualizes the decision making context of a reservoir operated for hydropower production the main objective of a hydropower operator is usually revenue maximization anghileri et al 2018b jager and smith 2008 madani and lund xxxx in the simple but general case where one reservoir feeds one hydropower plant the revenue is computed by multiplying the electricity price by the plant production which in turn depends on the reservoir release and level in deregulated electricity markets the electricity price changes with high frequency however since we consider a daily decision time step to reduce the computational complexity of the control problem we compute the daily revenue r t 1 as 4 r t 1 j 0 n t 1 θ t mod t j g t 1 where θ t mod t j mwh is the electricity price in the j th most profitable hour of day t n t 1 is the daily number of hours in which the plant is operated at full capacity and g t 1 mwh is the electricity production of the plant when operated at full capacity eq 4 allows to partially account for the volatility of the electricity price at the hourly resolution even if the operations are modelled at the daily resolution this is key in our analysis as the electricity price projection we use in the scenario based analysis show a high hourly volatility due to the projected increase of variable renewable electricity sources in europe see section 2 and supplementary material c in particular eq 4 provides an upper bound estimate of the hydropower revenue see for an extensive discussion on the modelling details anghileri et al 2013 anghileri et al 2018b the constraints of the control problem include the storage mass balance equation see eq 3 1 and other equations describing the feasible bounds of the reservoir storage and release the release bounds depend on the reservoir level and describe the reservoir spillways characteristics in the optimization problem the reservoir inflow a t 1 is modelled as a cyclostationary stochastic process by means of a series of lognormal probability distribution functions the parameters of the distributions i e mean and variance are calculated based on the reservoir inflow simulated by topkapi eth the electricity price θ t mod t j in eq 4 is instead modelled as a cyclostationary deterministic trajectory the choice of considering a deterministic trajectory of electricity price instead of a stochastic distribution is driven by the data availability for characterizing the future price scenario which consists in a trajectory representing a reference year in the future see section 4 and supplementary material c we solve the optimization problem via stochastic dynamic programming castelletti et al 2008 thus obtaining the reservoir operating rule r t 1 f t s t for the normative approach 4 scenarios and experimental setting the main variables driving the system dynamics in this analysis are precipitation temperature and electricity price precipitation and temperature drive the catchment hydrological dynamics and the water resource availability for hydropower production electricity price drives the amount and timing of reservoir releases we analyze different sets of these drivers depending on the combination of meteorological and price time series first we consider the historical situation which is characterized by the observed time series of meteorological variables and electricity prices obs in table 1 these inputs are used in the retrospective analysis hist experiment in table 1 where we assess the capability of the descriptive and normative approaches of reproducing the historical observed reservoir operations and its impact on the downstream hydrology the historical meteorological data provided by the regional agency for environmental protection arpa lombardia are daily temperature and precipitation measured over the period 2008 2013 recorded at the gauges shown in fig 1 the historical electricity prices used in this study are hourly data provided by the italian electricity market operator over the period 2009 2015 we also consider two possible future scenarios characterized by hydro meteorological and hydropower operating contexts that are increasingly altered with respect to the historical context the first one is characterized by climate change projections of the meteorological variables while the electricity price is the same as in the historical experiment cc scenario in table 1 the second scenario is characterized by both climate change and electricity price change due to a modification of the electricity demand and generation portfolio in europe cpc scenario in table 1 these scenarios are used in a scenario based analysis where we assess the capability of the modelling approaches in anticipating future impacts of climate and socio economic changes when maintaining business as usual operations bau experiment in table 1 and in testing alternative adapted operations i e re optimized operations to these changes ada experiments in table 1 future meteorological projections are obtained from three different euro cordex climate change scenarios considering rcp4 5 and different combinations of global climate models gcms and regional climate models rcms as detailed in table 2 the projections which have a spatial resolution of 0 11 degrees are bias corrected and downscaled using quantile mapping anghileri et al 2011 boe et al 2007 to generate future trajectories at catchment scale for the period 2036 2065 see supplementary material b for further details fig 3 a c shows the 10th 50th 90th percentiles computed on a monthly basis of reservoir inflow simulated through topkapi eth using either the historical observations over the period 2008 2013 of precipitation and temperature or the bias corrected and downscaled climate scenarios over the period 2036 2065 the small increase in streamflow from october to april results from the projected increase in temperature in autumn and winter see supplementary material b which leads to a reduction in snowfall and increase in rainfall in winter time the reduction of snowfall together with a generalized increase in temperature all over the year impacts the snow and ice accumulation melt processes simulated by the hydrological model the consequence is a significant reduction in spring and summer streamflow in addition the future glaciers retreat leads to a higher inflow variability with respect to the historical situation especially in the summer months all the above mentioned dynamics are in line with streamflow projections for snow dominated catchments in the alps see e g farinotti et al 2016 schaefli 2015 overall the total annual volume is projected to be lower if compared to the historical simulation because of the projected glacier retreat which impacts especially the amount of water captured by the river diversions in high elevation areas future prices relative to the year 2050 are taken from schlecht and weigt 2015 and based on simulations of the swissmod model schlecht and weigt 2014 which represents part of the electricity wholesale market including switzerland italy france germany and austria considering changes in the electricity demand and production portfolios in europe see supplementary material c for further details fig 3d shows the daily percentage deviation of the mean electricity prices computed over the period 2009 2015 from the average price computed over the same period and the daily percentage deviation of electricity prices estimated according to the projection over the reference year 2050 from the average price of the same year the historical trajectory shows higher prices in winter i e january february december and in summer i e from july to september due to the high electricity demand for heating and air conditioning respectively the future trajectory which presents overall higher average price and volatility with respect to the historical prices see supplementary material c for further details show higher prices in winter and lower prices in summer where the very high renewable power allows to almost completely cover the electricity demand 5 evaluation framework in the retrospective analysis we compare the descriptive and normative approaches by assessing how they perform in simulating the historical observed reservoir operations over different time scales to this purpose we compute the mean annual hydropower revenue as a summary metric of the hydropower operations over one year and we also analyze the seasonal and interannual reservoir dynamics as well as the variability of reservoir release on a daily scale the revenue is computed according to the eq 4 using the observed reservoir release or the release simulated in the hist experiment from either the descriptive or normative approach in the scenario based analysis we compare the descriptive and normative approaches for modelling reservoir operations by assessing their capability in responding to changes in the operating context i e reservoir inflow and electricity price thus we assess the capability of the two approaches in anticipating the future impacts of these changes bau experiment in table 1 and in testing alternative adaptation strategies ada experiment in table 1 the target level of the descriptive approach for modelling reservoir operations l t mod t in eq 3 is computed as cyclostationary average of historical reservoir levels over the period 2008 2013 instead the reservoir operating rule f of the normative approach is obtained by solving the optimal control problem described in section 3 3 accounting for historical or projected time series of reservoir inflow and electricity price depending on the experiment considered see table 1 to understand the extent of the effects of alternative adaptation strategies on the hydrological regimes we compute some indicators to express the hydrological alteration that the operations of the ada cpc experiment would cause if compared to the operations in the bau experiment the indicators we consider are partly inspired from the indicators of hydrological alterations richter et al 1996 and are meant to quantify the alteration in magnitude and variability of the daily streamflow downstream from the reservoir as these are two characteristic of the streamflow regime which are key for the health of river corridors and aquatic ecosystems the two considered indicators are the mean monthly water volume and the mean monthly rise fall rate the latter being defined as the mean of all positive negative streamflow differences between consecutive days we compute the indicators in three different river sections downstream from the reservoir to assess how persistent the streamflow alteration is the sections a b and c in fig 1 are located about 20 40 and 80 km far from the reservoir and have an upstream area of about 500 800 and 1300 km2 respectively 6 comparative analysis of descriptive and normative approaches for modelling reservoir operations 6 1 retrospective analysis the historical revenue 106 1 m year can be satisfactory reproduced by both the descriptive approach 103 5 m year and the normative approach 106 7 m year the estimate obtained by means of the descriptive approach is 2 5 lower than the historical estimate although small this difference is comparable to other studies optimizing hydropower system operations in the alps see anghileri et al 2019 gaudard et al 2013 fig 4 shows the monthly mean of observed and simulated reservoir level computed over the period 2008 2013 and its interannual variability represented by the 10th and 90th percentiles shaded areas the observed reservoir level shows the typical alpine seasonal reservoir dynamics the reservoir is usually empty around april and it recovers fully by september october there is a fairly large interannual variability shaded area which results from both the variability of the reservoir inflow and the flexibility of the historical operations in accommodating the fluctuation in the main external drivers i e reservoir inflow demand and electricity price the reservoir level simulated using the descriptive approach perfectly represents the average observed level but it does not show any interannual variability the 10th and 90th percentiles almost completely overlap one to another this behavior is not surprising given the definition of the target level in the descriptive approach which forces reservoir operations to track the average observed level trajectory the normative approach instead is less accurate in reproducing the average observed level but it shows an interannual variability comparable to the observed one as the optimal reservoir operating rule can adapt the reservoir release to the variability of the external drivers as these are explicitly accounted for by the control problem formulation see section 3 3 the descriptive and normative approaches do not only simulate different monthly and interannual dynamics but also different weekly dynamics fig 5 shows the box plot of the release computed for each day of the week over the whole simulation period 2008 2013 the observed release is almost constant during the weekdays monday to friday and it is significantly lower during the weekends saturday and sunday when the electricity demand and the electricity price are usually lower this behavior can not be reproduced by the descriptive approach which simulates fairly similar releases on both weekdays and weekends it is instead well reproduced by the normative approach although the release variability is underestimated during the weekends it is worth noting that the descriptive approach is not able to reproduce these release dynamics due to its intrinsic formulation based on an average cyclostationary target level that does not distinguish between different days of the week smoothing out the weekly patterns an improved descriptive approach that would allow to partly simulate the weekly release fluctuations should account for a target level computed by aligning the historical releases on the basis of the month and weekdays i e starting from the first monday of january instead of january 1 st results obtained using this improved descriptive approach confirm the ability to simulate the weekly pattern highlighting lower releases in the weekends with respect to the weekdays not shown 6 2 scenario based analysis because the results relative to all three climate scenarios are very similar we present in the following the results relative to scenario 1 in table 2 while the others are reported in supplementary material d the average level simulated by the descriptive approach in the bau experiment is almost identical to the hist experiment fig 6 a there is instead a significant alteration in the average reservoir release pattern fig 6c with a lower release from may to september the descriptive approach indeed aims to track the historical target level even if the inflow pattern has changed the earlier snow melt in april and may fig 3a is not stored because the operating rule of the descriptive approach forces the reservoir to be empty in those months to match the target level on the contrary the normative approach simulates an average release pattern similar to the one in the hist experiment although the release is generally lower fig 6d as a consequence the simulated level does not fully recover to the maximum capacity fig 6b because of the lower projected inflow volume fig 3a bau experiments conducted using the descriptive and normative approaches show a mean annual revenue decrease of 17 9 and 16 4 respectively compared to the mean annual revenue obtained in their respective hist experiments see table 3 this significant reduction is mainly attributable to the reduction in reservoir inflow and it is only mildly dependent on which approach i e descriptive or normative is adopted for modelling the reservoir operations contrary to the retrospective analysis it is more difficult to judge the performance of the two bau simulations in anticipating the hydropower operations under the climate change scenario as there is no observed reference they could be compared with we can only qualitatively discuss the projected reservoir dynamics based on our knowledge of the principles governing the historical reservoir operations both the bau simulations show some unusual characteristics in this respect which might induce one to question whether they properly anticipate the future hydropower operations as previously discussed on the one hand the operations simulated by the descriptive approach do not store the anticipated snowmelt period may august which is the main contribution to build the winter reservoir storage on the other hand the operations simulated by the normative approach generate low reservoir levels all along the year which are not ideal for maximizing the electricity production as they don t benefit from the hydraulic head effect however alternative operations may exist which could better accommodate projected changes in water availability unfortunately it is hard to test any alternative reservoir operation using the descriptive approach because the underlying target level operating rule strictly relies on past observations and any adapted target level would be totally arbitrary the normative approach is instead suitable for testing adaptation options under the assumption that the decision making process described by the optimal control problem is independent from the future scenario this latter is a reasonable assumption because it is likely that the maximization of revenue will likely remain the main operating objective in the future the reservoir operating rule of the normative approach can thus be re designed accounting for the altered inflow conditions but still keeping the revenue maximization target accordingly the inflow probability distribution function included in the control problem formulation can be re computed on the basis of the climate change inflow scenario and a new operating rule can be designed by solving the corresponding new optimization problem see section 3 3 the experiment ada cc in fig 6 shows the average reservoir level and release obtained when the reservoir operations are re optimized to adapt to climate change the reservoir refill is anticipated to match the earlier snow melt fig 6b and the simulated reservoir level is always higher than in the bau experiment the release pattern is also different than those simulated in the hist and bau experiments fig 6d as the adapted operations suggest to reduce the release in may and june so to increase the release in other periods especially in winter which are characterized by higher electricity prices in doing so the reservoir operations of the ada cc experiment reduce the revenue losses estimated in the bau experiment by about 6 i e about 1 m year as shown in table 3 because these new behaviours are in agreement with what one would expect from the previous qualitative discussion we could argue that the adapted operating rule is more appropriate than the bau operating rule to describe the behaviour of the reservoir operator in the future when considering possible changes in the electricity price on top of the changes in climate ada cpc experiment the context in which the reservoir is operated is even more different from the historical one and the bau experiments could be even less appropriate for anticipating the effects of future reservoir operations fig 6b d shows in fact that the level and especially the release patterns significantly change when the operating rule of the normative approach is re optimized to account for the changes in both climate and prices characterizing the cpc scenario the mean release pattern is indeed very different from the previous experiments see fig 6d an adapted reservoir operation characterized by a higher release variability allows mitigating the revenue loss due to the reduced inflow following the climate change impacts as shown in table 3 but may have undesired effects on the downstream river reaches and their ecological conditions in terms of hydropower revenue the bau reservoir operations of both descriptive and normative approaches obtain almost the same results in particular we can observe a much higher revenue with respect to the hist experiments due to the higher average prices projected in the future if we focus on the adapted operations we can see that the ada cpc experiment allows to obtain an increase in hydropower revenue of about 2 2 i e about 5 m y to understand the extent and the sign positive vs negative of such effects we compute some indicators to express the hydrological alteration that the operations of the ada cpc experiment would cause if compared to the operations in the bau experiment see section 5 for a description of the indicators fig 7 a shows for each month m and for each section i the percentage deviation i m i of the water flow simulated in ada cpc experiment i m i ada cpc m3 s with respect to the water flow simulated in bau experiment i m i bau m3 s i e 5 i m i i m i ada cpc i m i bau i m i bau i m i ranges from 30 to more than 50 depending on the section location fig 7b shows the percentage deviation of mean annual rise and fall indicators computed in the ada cpc experiment with respect to those computed in the bau experiment the mean rise and fall indicators increase in all the sections with alterations from about 40 in the farthest section i e section c to more than 70 in the closest section i e section a accordingly the adaptation of future reservoir operating rule to maximize revenues under changed driver conditions can strongly modify impacts on streamflow regimes when compared to the present production strategy the sign and magnitude of the changes can enhance the already negative effects of hydropower operation on streamflow conditions as discussed in the next section 7 conclusions in this paper we compared two approaches descriptive and normative to model reservoir operations within a high resolution physically explicit and fully distributed hydrological model to ultimately assess how much a different approach to modelling reservoir operations impacts downstream hydrological dynamics the two approaches are different because the descriptive approach as it is traditionally implemented in many hydrology focused studies e g finger et al 2012 fatichi et al 2015 qiu et al 2019 ravazzani et al 2014 veijalainen et al 2010 aims to reproduce how the reservoir has been normally operated in the past while the normative approach traditionally adopted in water resources management studies aims at describing the principles behind the decision making process of a rational reservoir operator we used a hydropower reservoir system in the catchment of lake como northern italy as a proof of concept to test the suitability of the two approaches in representing reservoir operations in a system where water is diverted from the natural river network and stored in a reservoir for hydropower production in what we called retrospective analysis we assessed the relevance of the two approaches by contrasting their simulations to the historically observed reservoir dynamics the descriptive approach can accurately describe the average reservoir dynamics by reproducing the seasonal water volume shift from the snow melt season to the subsequent winter yet it fails in representing any interannual variability observed in the past and in reproducing the weekly periodicity typical of hydropower operations thus resulting in a poor representation of the reservoir release fluctuations which are an important aspect of the hydropower impacts on the downstream environment on the other hand the normative approach can reproduce the seasonal and weekly dynamics including their variability although it is less accurate in reproducing the average reservoir dynamics we acknowledge that unfortunately the limited data availability over the historical period does not allow us to compare the different approaches in extreme dry or wet conditions in what we called the scenario based analysis we assessed the capability of the two approaches in anticipating the impacts of the operations of the hydropower system under future scenarios of changes in climate and electricity prices by simulating business as usual operations i e the situation in which the reservoir is operated according to the historical operations but forced by different climate and price drivers both the descriptive and the normative approach show release trajectories significantly different from the historical operations which produce a considerable decrease in the hydropower revenue because it is reasonable to expect that the decision makers would adapt to the different decision making context we explored different operations and their impacts on river reaches downstream of the hydropower system the descriptive approach is heavily conditioned on the observed hydropower operations for the definition of the target level and any definition of an alternative target level would be arbitrary this hinders the analysis on possible future evolution of water system dynamics under different scenarios the normative approach allows instead to explore how decision makers could adapt to future changes in the operating context by re designing the operating rule to account for changes in the drivers the analysis of the adapted operations shows that the fluctuations of the river flow downstream from the reservoir could be enhanced by 50 in fall and winter months and reduced by 30 in summer months thus exacerbating the well known negative hydropower impacts on downstream river regime these fluctuations persist even 80 km far from the reservoir these results confirm the importance of testing alternative decision making strategies to assess the range and uncertainties of the impacts induced by human activities under future scenarios this is particularly important in view of the need to reconcile improved hydropower production necessary to contribute the energy transition with the conservation of aquatic ecosystems necessary to avoid the loss of their important services the paper s results clearly show the potential of the normative approach in anticipating decision makers adaptations to future changes in addition this approach overcomes the issue of simulating predicting reservoir operations in systems where no observations of reservoir dynamics are available and consequently reservoir operating policies are unknown brown et al 2015 however when adopting this approach some key aspects and assumptions have to be considered first the correct definition of the objective function and the constraints is crucial for exploring a meaningful range of different human decisions second real world operations are rarely purely single objective as we assumed in this work but there might be other operating objectives which partly drive the operations for example in specific situations examples of extraordinary operating objectives could be in our case the satisfaction of electricity demands of particular clients third the assumption of full rationality of the decision maker should be examined carefully on each single case as some decision makers might not have a clear goal oriented decision making attitude see e g mason et al 2018 and references therein finally we implicitly assumed that the mechanisms underlying the decision making process for example the reservoir operating objective remain unchanged in the future i e they are not influenced by any change in the drivers this assumption might not always hold true and should be critically discussed case by case for example it is reasonable to assume that the main purpose of the hydropower operations will be the maximization of the revenue even in the future as we did in this work however it is also reasonable to assume that the reservoirs purely operated for hydropower purposes may be used under scenarios of increasing dry conditions and scarce water availability for other purposes such as urban or agricultural water supply even more in this case the normative approach could flexibly accommodate an analysis testing the impacts of different operating objectives by changing the formulation of the control problem in conclusion this study provides quantitative evidence of the need of carefully choosing the approach for simulating the response of catchments affected by human activities and infrastructure operations especially if the analysis focuses on future changing scenarios and adapted human controlled operations which replace historical decision making strategies a descriptive approach based on a target level is indeed easy to define and implement in any hydrological model as long as observations of the reservoir operations are available but fails in anticipating reservoir adaptation strategies conversely the normative approach is more powerful and general as it helps achieving a more accurate representation of the interplay among hydrological processes reservoir dynamics and the human controlled decision making process both when the focus is on reproducing historical operations and when exploring alternative operating strategies is needed credit authorship contribution statement

4804,human activities have a strong influence on the hydrological cycle altering natural patterns of evapotranspiration soil infiltration capacity ice cover groundwater distribution and ultimately streamflow at different spatio temporal scales yet modelling human activities and the associated impacts are often given a secondary importance in hydrological models with respect to the high fidelity characterization of natural processes especially at the catchment scale while this has little or no influence on model accuracy when modelling pristine watersheds it remarkably deteriorates the model performance in river basins with a considerable anthropogenic footprint operations of water infrastructures within a watershed e g a dam or a diversion dam are commonly modelled based on observational data when available this reproduces to some extent the historical decisions but might be inadequate to simulate operations outside of historical climate or socio economic conditions in this paper we compare a descriptive approach traditionally adopted in hydrological models where reservoir operations are determined by tracking the historical average release and a normative approach where the operations are dynamically conditioned upon the reservoir storage and can adapt to the climate and socio economic conditions influencing the reservoir operations we contrast these two approaches by assessing the reservoir dynamics and the impacts on the downstream river system across time scales from daily to seasonal we first discuss the accuracy of the two approaches in reproducing historical observations then we explore their potential in anticipating the impacts of future reservoir operations when considering climate and socio economic change scenarios thus testing the approaches in decision making contexts increasingly altered with respect to the historical one we critically present the advantages and disadvantages of either approach thus contributing to clarify the importance

human activities for instance several global scale hydrological models include water allocation rules to represent water withdrawals from the river network and groundwater and water distribution to different uses such as agriculture and hydropower production e g dang et al 2019 doll et al 2012 pokhrel et al 2016 wada et al 2014 focusing on reservoir operations specifically several studies have proposed approaches to include reservoir operations within state of the art hydrological models at the global scale to simulate reservoir dynamics and their effects on the hydrological cycle haddeland et al 2006 hanasaki et al 2006 wisser et al 2010 according to yassin et al 2019 the existing approaches can be divided into inflow and demand based methods and target storage and release based methods methods belonging to the first group define reservoir release as a function of reservoir inflow and demand while methods belonging to the second group aim at tracking a predefined reservoir level often called target level which is usually defined on the basis of reservoir dynamics observed in the past e g biemans et al 2011 hanasaki et al 2008a b pokhrel et al 2012 voisin et al 2013 describing

reservoir operations and the dynamic of the hydrological system target storage and release based methods are widely adopted in catchment scale hydrological models as well e g finger et al 2012 fatichi

descriptive approach which is a relatively simple approach representing the actual decision making process through a set of rules a more sophisticated decision making model could alternatively be achieved adopting a normative approach this is a relatively more complex approach describing the decision making process of a rational decision maker who maximizes a given utility function in this case the decisions are obtained by solving an optimization problem becker 2013 kagel and roth 2016 the adequacy of the decision making model either descriptive or normative is usually evaluated against how well the decisions observed in the past are represented unfortunately records of past decisions are often not available especially over long time periods which is key for testing the models against different decision making contexts ligtenberg et al 2010 the decision making model can then be evaluated for its theoretical adequacy i e the degree to which the conceptualization of the decision making process is acceptable or realistic mason et al 2018 in this respect both the descriptive and normative approaches have some theoretical drawbacks the data driven nature of the descriptive approach for instance could fail in anticipating possible changes in reservoir operations due to changes in decision making drivers as it could happen with climate change the normative approach on the other hand can require a large amount of data sometimes difficult to obtain to properly defining the optimization problem the assumption of full rationality underlying this approach has been widely criticized when applied to individuals kahneman et al 1991 as human behaviour is influenced by many factors such as past experience juliusson et al 2005 cognitive biases stanovich and west 2008 and personal belief acevedo and krueger 2004 nevertheless criticisms are less severe when this approach is used to represent the behaviour of group of individuals or institutions committed with pursuing a clear target e g hydropower revenue water demand satisfaction giuliani et al 2016a the normative approach is the state of the art approach in water resources management studies ahmad

surprisingly it has never been adopted in hydrology focused studies which concentrate on accurately describing the hydrological processes and assessing how hydrological dynamics respond to changes in natural drivers in this paper we thus compare a descriptive and a normative approach for simulating reservoir operations within a high resolution spatially distributed and physically explicit hydrological model to assess the adequacy of either approach in modelling catchments where the natural river network is disrupted by water diversions and reservoirs in particular we clarify the assumptions of each modelling approach and discuss their advantages and disadvantages we compare the descriptive and normative approach by conducting a retrospective analysis over historical observations and a scenario based analysis in the retrospective analysis we assess the accuracy of the modelling approaches in reproducing the observed reservoir operations and the impact on downstream hydrological regimes in the scenario based analysis we assess the capability of the two approaches in anticipating future impacts of climate and socio economic scenarios different from the historical ones in particular we focus on assessing the range of flow variability downstream from the reservoir the comparison between the two approaches is performed on the lake como catchment in northern italy where the interaction between reservoirs and natural environment is exemplary of alpine water systems the natural river network has been heavily exploited since the 1950 s by diverting water in artificial channels and reservoirs to produce hydropower electricity this catchment as most alpine water systems is expected to be significantly influenced by future changes in both climatic i e temperature precipitation and socio economic aspects i e electricity demand and prices e g anghileri et al 2018a gaudard et al 2014 huss and hock 2018 schlecht and weigt 2015 thus representing a relevant case study for comparing the descriptive and normative modelling approaches the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a description of the study area section 3 presents the hydrological model the reservoir operations modelling approaches and their implementation for the specific case study section 4 shows the scenarios considered and the experimental setting section 6 shows the results of the comparative assessment between the descriptive and the normative approach for modelling reservoir operations finally section 7 summarizes the main findings of the paper 2 study area lake como fig 1 a is a subalpine regulated lake in northern italy with a catchment area of 4 552 km2 the lake is dominated by the mixed snow rain hydro climatic regime typical of the southern alps winter and summer are relatively dry while spring and autumn are relatively wet because of snow melt and rainfall events respectively the upper part of the catchment is heavily exploited for hydropower production by a complex system of 16 reservoirs which capture large amounts of water from their own catchments and from nearby catchments connected through artificial channels overall the reservoirs can store about 10 of he mean annual inflow to lake como and they contribute to almost 13 of the italian hydropower production their operations have altered the natural hydrological cycle as the reservoirs show an annual refill and draw down cycle which is synchronized with snow melt the timing of the beginning of the snow melt corresponds to the time when the reservoir storage is approximately empty and the refilling period starts the volume stored in spring and summer which would naturally flow downstream is instead released during the winter when the electricity demand and consequently the electricity price is usually higher denaro et al 2017 in this work we focus on the main hydropower reservoir system located in the study area fig 1b which is used as proof of concept for the comparison of the two approaches for modelling reservoir operations it is located in the upper part of the catchment see the white triangle in fig 1b and collects water over an area of about 1 000 km2 which is partly covered by glaciers through a dense network of river diversions the reservoir has a maximum storage capacity of 187 million m3 about 30 of the hydropower storage capacity of the entire lake como catchment and directly feeds a power plant with an installed capacity of 245 mw and a maximum flow of 41 06 m3 s 3 methods and models 3 1 hydrological model topkapi eth we used topkapi eth a physically explicit and fully distributed model to simulate the hydrological processes topkapi eth represents the catchment topography and a vertical discretization of the subsurface in three layers on regular grid of cells the runoff in each cell results from either infiltration or saturation excess processes or a combination thereof surface and subsurface routing is represented by a kinematic approximation of mass and momentum equation integrated on a topographic gradient the model describes the evapotranspiration processes using the priestley taylor equation priestley and taylor 1972 and snow and ice melt dynamics with a temperature index model based on shortwave radiation and air temperature carenzo et al 2009 pellicciotti et al 2005 further details about the model equations are given in fatichi et al 2015 the model inputs include temperature and precipitation time series for each grid cell at the temporal and spatial resolution selected for the model simulation also a series of spatial inputs are required to characterize the catchment features namely a digital elevation model a soil map a land cover map a map of the glacier ice thickness and a the location of the reservoirs and diversion channels for our specific case study we adopt a daily time resolution and a 250 250 m2 spatial resolution all the spatial inputs are provided by the regional agency for environmental protection arpa lombardia we use temperature and precipitation time series at the stations showed in fig 1 we used the thiessen polygons to move from point data i e station to the spatially distributed inputs required by the model temperature is adjusted to account for the elevation difference between each cell in the thiessen polygon and the corresponding gauge elevation using an adiabatic lapse rate precipitation is instead adjusted using a monthly multiplicative correction factor to account for the high spatial variability of precipitation in our study area which is characterized by a complex orography we used the alpine precipitation grid dataset in isotta et al 2014 to compute the correction factors as the ratio between the monthly precipitation in each cell in the thiessen polygon and in the cell where the gauge is located the gridded dataset has a spatial resolution of 5 km2 and results from historical records of approximately 5500 precipitation gauges over the alpine area including portions of italy switzerland austria germany france slovenia and croatia over the period 1971 2008 these factors are then applied to the precipitation time series observed in the stations topkapi eth has been widely used to simulate hydrological processes in natural catchments e g ragettli and pellicciotti 2012 as well in catchments where water is used for human activities e g costa et al 2018 finger et al 2012 fatichi et al 2015 the model in fact includes the description of water infrastructures such as reservoirs and water diversions the reservoir dynamics are based on mass balance conservation 1 s t 1 s t a t 1 e t 1 r t 1 where s t m3 represents the reservoir storage at time t and a t 1 m3 e t 1 m3 and r t 1 m3 are the total inflow to the reservoir the evaporation and the release from the reservoir occurring from t to t 1 respectively the total inflow is the sum of the water volume originated in the catchment directly drained by the reservoir the water volume diverted to the reservoir by means of artificial channels and the precipitation on the reservoir surface the artificial channels are modeled as transfer of surface water from one grid cell to another the actual amount of transferred water is regulated by two parameters the percentage of water that is transferred from the cell of origin and the maximum channel capacity the evaporation is calculated based on the time varying water volume contained in the reservoir at each time step using the priestley taylor equation the reservoir release r t 1 is defined as a function of the time t and the storage of the reservoir s t 2 r t 1 f t s t the reservoir operating rule f is defined differently depending on the modelling approach we adopt the descriptive approach is presented in section 3 2 and the normative approach in section 3 3 all the reservoir data needed to implement the two approaches are directly provided by the hydropower company however they can not be shared for confidentiality reasons we calibrated and validated topkapi eth on the period 2008 2009 and 2010 2013 respectively in order to satisfactorily reproduce the total inflow to the reservoir in particular we manually calibrated some parameters governing snow melt dynamics and soil infiltration see supplementary material a for more details we compared the net inflow i e actual inflow minus evaporation simulated using topkapi eth to the daily reservoir net inflow computed via mass balance from the available records of reservoir storage and release fig 2 a shows that the model is able to accurately reproduce the daily and seasonal inflow dynamics both in the dry and the wet season fig 2b shows that there is no systematic bias toward either over or under estimation this is reflected in the performance metrics for the calibration period 2008 2009 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is equal to 0 90 the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 is 0 94 and the root mean square error rmse is equal to 4 24 m3 s for the validation period 2010 2013 nse is equal to 0 76 kge is equal to 0 82 and rmse is equal to 5 95 m3 s fig 2c shows that the cumulative inflow is satisfactorily simulated by the model this is particularly interesting because the main function of the reservoir is to store water in water abundant periods e g spring and release it in water scarce period e g late summer winter to satisfy the electricity demand 3 2 descriptive approach for modelling reservoir operations according to the descriptive approach adopted in this study the reservoir is operated to track a given target level trajectory which represents the trajectory that the reservoir level should follow during a normal hydrological year the reservoir operating rule f is defined as 3 r t 1 0 if l t l t mod t r max l t if l t l t mod t where r t 1 m3 is the release volume from t to t 1 r max m3 is the maximum feasible release l t m is the reservoir level at time step t l t mod t m is the target level at time step t mod t the target level is defined as a periodic trajectory of period t and the notation t mod t represents the remainder of the division of t by t we consider a daily time step and an annual period i e t 365 days in our simulations the target level is thus the same for each january 1 st i e t 1 366 for a simulation starting on january 1 st january 2 nd i e t 2 367 etc in section 4 we will provide further details on how the target level is computed in our experiments the maximum feasible release depends on the reservoir level to account for spills when the reservoir level is higher than the maximum storage during normal operating conditions it is set to the maximum capacity of the power plant i e 41 06 m 3 s 3 3 normative approach for modelling reservoir operations according to the normative approach adopted in this study the reservoir operating rule f is obtained by solving an optimal control problem which conceptualizes the decision making context of a reservoir operated for hydropower production the main objective of a hydropower operator is usually revenue maximization anghileri et al 2018b jager and smith 2008 madani and lund xxxx in the simple but general case where one reservoir feeds one hydropower plant the revenue is computed by multiplying the electricity price by the plant production which in turn depends on the reservoir release and level in deregulated electricity markets the electricity price changes with high frequency however since we consider a daily decision time step to reduce the computational complexity of the control problem we compute the daily revenue r t 1 as 4 r t 1 j 0 n t 1 θ t mod t j g t 1 where θ t mod t j mwh is the electricity price in the j th most profitable hour of day t n t 1 is the daily number of hours in which the plant is operated at full capacity and g t 1 mwh is the electricity production of the plant when operated at full capacity eq 4 allows to partially account for the volatility of the electricity price at the hourly resolution even if the operations are modelled at the daily resolution this is key in our analysis as the electricity price projection we use in the scenario based analysis show a high hourly volatility due to the projected increase of variable renewable electricity sources in europe see section 2 and supplementary material c in particular eq 4 provides an upper bound estimate of the hydropower revenue see for an extensive discussion on the modelling details anghileri et al 2013 anghileri et al 2018b the constraints of the control problem include the storage mass balance equation see eq 3 1 and other equations describing the feasible bounds of the reservoir storage and release the release bounds depend on the reservoir level and describe the reservoir spillways characteristics in the optimization problem the reservoir inflow a t 1 is modelled as a cyclostationary stochastic process by means of a series of lognormal probability distribution functions the parameters of the distributions i e mean and variance are calculated based on the reservoir inflow simulated by topkapi eth the electricity price θ t mod t j in eq 4 is instead modelled as a cyclostationary deterministic trajectory the choice of considering a deterministic trajectory of electricity price instead of a stochastic distribution is driven by the data availability for characterizing the future price scenario which consists in a trajectory representing a reference year in the future see section 4 and supplementary material c we solve the optimization problem via stochastic dynamic programming castelletti et al 2008 thus obtaining the reservoir operating rule r t 1 f t s t for the normative approach 4 scenarios and experimental setting the main variables driving the system dynamics in this analysis are precipitation temperature and electricity price precipitation and temperature drive the catchment hydrological dynamics and the water resource availability for hydropower production electricity price drives the amount and timing of reservoir releases we analyze different sets of these drivers depending on the combination of meteorological and price time series first we consider the historical situation which is characterized by the observed time series of meteorological variables and electricity prices obs in table 1 these inputs are used in the retrospective analysis hist experiment in table 1 where we assess the capability of the descriptive and normative approaches of reproducing the historical observed reservoir operations and its impact on the downstream hydrology the historical meteorological data provided by the regional agency for environmental protection arpa lombardia are daily temperature and precipitation measured over the period 2008 2013 recorded at the gauges shown in fig 1 the historical electricity prices used in this study are hourly data provided by the italian electricity market operator over the period 2009 2015 we also consider two possible future scenarios characterized by hydro meteorological and hydropower operating contexts that are increasingly altered with respect to the historical context the first one is characterized by climate change projections of the meteorological variables while the electricity price is the same as in the historical experiment cc scenario in table 1 the second scenario is characterized by both climate change and electricity price change due to a modification of the electricity demand and generation portfolio in europe cpc scenario in table 1 these scenarios are used in a scenario based analysis where we assess the capability of the modelling approaches in anticipating future impacts of climate and socio economic changes when maintaining business as usual operations bau experiment in table 1 and in testing alternative adapted operations i e re optimized operations to these changes ada experiments in table 1 future meteorological projections are obtained from three different euro cordex climate change scenarios considering rcp4 5 and different combinations of global climate models gcms and regional climate models rcms as detailed in table 2 the projections which have a spatial resolution of 0 11 degrees are bias corrected and downscaled using quantile mapping anghileri et al 2011 boe et al 2007 to generate future trajectories at catchment scale for the period 2036 2065 see supplementary material b for further details fig 3 a c shows the 10th 50th 90th percentiles computed on a monthly basis of reservoir inflow simulated through topkapi eth using either the historical observations over the period 2008 2013 of precipitation and temperature or the bias corrected and downscaled climate scenarios over the period 2036 2065 the small increase in streamflow from october to april results from the projected increase in temperature in autumn and winter see supplementary material b which leads to a reduction in snowfall and increase in rainfall in winter time the reduction of snowfall together with a generalized increase in temperature all over the year impacts the snow and ice accumulation melt processes simulated by the hydrological model the consequence is a significant reduction in spring and summer streamflow in addition the future glaciers retreat leads to a higher inflow variability with respect to the historical situation especially in the summer months all the above mentioned dynamics are in line with streamflow projections for snow dominated catchments in the alps see e g farinotti et al 2016 schaefli 2015 overall the total annual volume is projected to be lower if compared to the historical simulation because of the projected glacier retreat which impacts especially the amount of water captured by the river diversions in high elevation areas future prices relative to the year 2050 are taken from schlecht and weigt 2015 and based on simulations of the swissmod model schlecht and weigt 2014 which represents part of the electricity wholesale market including switzerland italy france germany and austria considering changes in the electricity demand and production portfolios in europe see supplementary material c for further details fig 3d shows the daily percentage deviation of the mean electricity prices computed over the period 2009 2015 from the average price computed over the same period and the daily percentage deviation of electricity prices estimated according to the projection over the reference year 2050 from the average price of the same year the historical trajectory shows higher prices in winter i e january february december and in summer i e from july to september due to the high electricity demand for heating and air conditioning respectively the future trajectory which presents overall higher average price and volatility with respect to the historical prices see supplementary material c for further details show higher prices in winter and lower prices in summer where the very high renewable power allows to almost completely cover the electricity demand 5 evaluation framework in the retrospective analysis we compare the descriptive and normative approaches by assessing how they perform in simulating the historical observed reservoir operations over different time scales to this purpose we compute the mean annual hydropower revenue as a summary metric of the hydropower operations over one year and we also analyze the seasonal and interannual reservoir dynamics as well as the variability of reservoir release on a daily scale the revenue is computed according to the eq 4 using the observed reservoir release or the release simulated in the hist experiment from either the descriptive or normative approach in the scenario based analysis we compare the descriptive and normative approaches for modelling reservoir operations by assessing their capability in responding to changes in the operating context i e reservoir inflow and electricity price thus we assess the capability of the two approaches in anticipating the future impacts of these changes bau experiment in table 1 and in testing alternative adaptation strategies ada experiment in table 1 the target level of the descriptive approach for modelling reservoir operations l t mod t in eq 3 is computed as cyclostationary average of historical reservoir levels over the period 2008 2013 instead the reservoir operating rule f of the normative approach is obtained by solving the optimal control problem described in section 3 3 accounting for historical or projected time series of reservoir inflow and electricity price depending on the experiment considered see table 1 to understand the extent of the effects of alternative adaptation strategies on the hydrological regimes we compute some indicators to express the hydrological alteration that the operations of the ada cpc experiment would cause if compared to the operations in the bau experiment the indicators we consider are partly inspired from the indicators of hydrological alterations richter et al 1996 and are meant to quantify the alteration in magnitude and variability of the daily streamflow downstream from the reservoir as these are two characteristic of the streamflow regime which are key for the health of river corridors and aquatic ecosystems the two considered indicators are the mean monthly water volume and the mean monthly rise fall rate the latter being defined as the mean of all positive negative streamflow differences between consecutive days we compute the indicators in three different river sections downstream from the reservoir to assess how persistent the streamflow alteration is the sections a b and c in fig 1 are located about 20 40 and 80 km far from the reservoir and have an upstream area of about 500 800 and 1300 km2 respectively 6 comparative analysis of descriptive and normative approaches for modelling reservoir operations 6 1 retrospective analysis the historical revenue 106 1 m year can be satisfactory reproduced by both the descriptive approach 103 5 m year and the normative approach 106 7 m year the estimate obtained by means of the descriptive approach is 2 5 lower than the historical estimate although small this difference is comparable to other studies optimizing hydropower system operations in the alps see anghileri et al 2019 gaudard et al 2013 fig 4 shows the monthly mean of observed and simulated reservoir level computed over the period 2008 2013 and its interannual variability represented by the 10th and 90th percentiles shaded areas the observed reservoir level shows the typical alpine seasonal reservoir dynamics the reservoir is usually empty around april and it recovers fully by september october there is a fairly large interannual variability shaded area which results from both the variability of the reservoir inflow and the flexibility of the historical operations in accommodating the fluctuation in the main external drivers i e reservoir inflow demand and electricity price the reservoir level simulated using the descriptive approach perfectly represents the average observed level but it does not show any interannual variability the 10th and 90th percentiles almost completely overlap one to another this behavior is not surprising given the definition of the target level in the descriptive approach which forces reservoir operations to track the average observed level trajectory the normative approach instead is less accurate in reproducing the average observed level but it shows an interannual variability comparable to the observed one as the optimal reservoir operating rule can adapt the reservoir release to the variability of the external drivers as these are explicitly accounted for by the control problem formulation see section 3 3 the descriptive and normative approaches do not only simulate different monthly and interannual dynamics but also different weekly dynamics fig 5 shows the box plot of the release computed for each day of the week over the whole simulation period 2008 2013 the observed release is almost constant during the weekdays monday to friday and it is significantly lower during the weekends saturday and sunday when the electricity demand and the electricity price are usually lower this behavior can not be reproduced by the descriptive approach which simulates fairly similar releases on both weekdays and weekends it is instead well reproduced by the normative approach although the release variability is underestimated during the weekends it is worth noting that the descriptive approach is not able to reproduce these release dynamics due to its intrinsic formulation based on an average cyclostationary target level that does not distinguish between different days of the week smoothing out the weekly patterns an improved descriptive approach that would allow to partly simulate the weekly release fluctuations should account for a target level computed by aligning the historical releases on the basis of the month and weekdays i e starting from the first monday of january instead of january 1 st results obtained using this improved descriptive approach confirm the ability to simulate the weekly pattern highlighting lower releases in the weekends with respect to the weekdays not shown 6 2 scenario based analysis because the results relative to all three climate scenarios are very similar we present in the following the results relative to scenario 1 in table 2 while the others are reported in supplementary material d the average level simulated by the descriptive approach in the bau experiment is almost identical to the hist experiment fig 6 a there is instead a significant alteration in the average reservoir release pattern fig 6c with a lower release from may to september the descriptive approach indeed aims to track the historical target level even if the inflow pattern has changed the earlier snow melt in april and may fig 3a is not stored because the operating rule of the descriptive approach forces the reservoir to be empty in those months to match the target level on the contrary the normative approach simulates an average release pattern similar to the one in the hist experiment although the release is generally lower fig 6d as a consequence the simulated level does not fully recover to the maximum capacity fig 6b because of the lower projected inflow volume fig 3a bau experiments conducted using the descriptive and normative approaches show a mean annual revenue decrease of 17 9 and 16 4 respectively compared to the mean annual revenue obtained in their respective hist experiments see table 3 this significant reduction is mainly attributable to the reduction in reservoir inflow and it is only mildly dependent on which approach i e descriptive or normative is adopted for modelling the reservoir operations contrary to the retrospective analysis it is more difficult to judge the performance of the two bau simulations in anticipating the hydropower operations under the climate change scenario as there is no observed reference they could be compared with we can only qualitatively discuss the projected reservoir dynamics based on our knowledge of the principles governing the historical reservoir operations both the bau simulations show some unusual characteristics in this respect which might induce one to question whether they properly anticipate the future hydropower operations as previously discussed on the one hand the operations simulated by the descriptive approach do not store the anticipated snowmelt period may august which is the main contribution to build the winter reservoir storage on the other hand the operations simulated by the normative approach generate low reservoir levels all along the year which are not ideal for maximizing the electricity production as they don t benefit from the hydraulic head effect however alternative operations may exist which could better accommodate projected changes in water availability unfortunately it is hard to test any alternative reservoir operation using the descriptive approach because the underlying target level operating rule strictly relies on past observations and any adapted target level would be totally arbitrary the normative approach is instead suitable for testing adaptation options under the assumption that the decision making process described by the optimal control problem is independent from the future scenario this latter is a reasonable assumption because it is likely that the maximization of revenue will likely remain the main operating objective in the future the reservoir operating rule of the normative approach can thus be re designed accounting for the altered inflow conditions but still keeping the revenue maximization target accordingly the inflow probability distribution function included in the control problem formulation can be re computed on the basis of the climate change inflow scenario and a new operating rule can be designed by solving the corresponding new optimization problem see section 3 3 the experiment ada cc in fig 6 shows the average reservoir level and release obtained when the reservoir operations are re optimized to adapt to climate change the reservoir refill is anticipated to match the earlier snow melt fig 6b and the simulated reservoir level is always higher than in the bau experiment the release pattern is also different than those simulated in the hist and bau experiments fig 6d as the adapted operations suggest to reduce the release in may and june so to increase the release in other periods especially in winter which are characterized by higher electricity prices in doing so the reservoir operations of the ada cc experiment reduce the revenue losses estimated in the bau experiment by about 6 i e about 1 m year as shown in table 3 because these new behaviours are in agreement with what one would expect from the previous qualitative discussion we could argue that the adapted operating rule is more appropriate than the bau operating rule to describe the behaviour of the reservoir operator in the future when considering possible changes in the electricity price on top of the changes in climate ada cpc experiment the context in which the reservoir is operated is even more different from the historical one and the bau experiments could be even less appropriate for anticipating the effects of future reservoir operations fig 6b d shows in fact that the level and especially the release patterns significantly change when the operating rule of the normative approach is re optimized to account for the changes in both climate and prices characterizing the cpc scenario the mean release pattern is indeed very different from the previous experiments see fig 6d an adapted reservoir operation characterized by a higher release variability allows mitigating the revenue loss due to the reduced inflow following the climate change impacts as shown in table 3 but may have undesired effects on the downstream river reaches and their ecological conditions in terms of hydropower revenue the bau reservoir operations of both descriptive and normative approaches obtain almost the same results in particular we can observe a much higher revenue with respect to the hist experiments due to the higher average prices projected in the future if we focus on the adapted operations we can see that the ada cpc experiment allows to obtain an increase in hydropower revenue of about 2 2 i e about 5 m y to understand the extent and the sign positive vs negative of such effects we compute some indicators to express the hydrological alteration that the operations of the ada cpc experiment would cause if compared to the operations in the bau experiment see section 5 for a description of the indicators fig 7 a shows for each month m and for each section i the percentage deviation i m i of the water flow simulated in ada cpc experiment i m i ada cpc m3 s with respect to the water flow simulated in bau experiment i m i bau m3 s i e 5 i m i i m i ada cpc i m i bau i m i bau i m i ranges from 30 to more than 50 depending on the section location fig 7b shows the percentage deviation of mean annual rise and fall indicators computed in the ada cpc experiment with respect to those computed in the bau experiment the mean rise and fall indicators increase in all the sections with alterations from about 40 in the farthest section i e section c to more than 70 in the closest section i e section a accordingly the adaptation of future reservoir operating rule to maximize revenues under changed driver conditions can strongly modify impacts on streamflow regimes when compared to the present production strategy the sign and magnitude of the changes can enhance the already negative effects of hydropower operation on streamflow conditions as discussed in the next section 7 conclusions in this paper we compared two approaches descriptive and normative to model reservoir operations within a high resolution physically explicit and fully distributed hydrological model to ultimately assess how much a different approach to modelling reservoir operations impacts downstream hydrological dynamics the two approaches are different because the descriptive approach as it is traditionally implemented in many hydrology focused studies e g finger et al 2012 fatichi et al 2015 qiu et al 2019 ravazzani et al 2014 veijalainen et al 2010 aims to reproduce how the reservoir has been normally operated in the past while the normative approach traditionally adopted in water resources management studies aims at describing the principles behind the decision making process of a rational reservoir operator we used a hydropower reservoir system in the catchment of lake como northern italy as a proof of concept to test the suitability of the two approaches in representing reservoir operations in a system where water is diverted from the natural river network and stored in a reservoir for hydropower production in what we called retrospective analysis we assessed the relevance of the two approaches by contrasting their simulations to the historically observed reservoir dynamics the descriptive approach can accurately describe the average reservoir dynamics by reproducing the seasonal water volume shift from the snow melt season to the subsequent winter yet it fails in representing any interannual variability observed in the past and in reproducing the weekly periodicity typical of hydropower operations thus resulting in a poor representation of the reservoir release fluctuations which are an important aspect of the hydropower impacts on the downstream environment on the other hand the normative approach can reproduce the seasonal and weekly dynamics including their variability although it is less accurate in reproducing the average reservoir dynamics we acknowledge that unfortunately the limited data availability over the historical period does not allow us to compare the different approaches in extreme dry or wet conditions in what we called the scenario based analysis we assessed the capability of the two approaches in anticipating the impacts of the operations of the hydropower system under future scenarios of changes in climate and electricity prices by simulating business as usual operations i e the situation in which the reservoir is operated according to the historical operations but forced by different climate and price drivers both the descriptive and the normative approach show release trajectories significantly different from the historical operations which produce a considerable decrease in the hydropower revenue because it is reasonable to expect that the decision makers would adapt to the different decision making context we explored different operations and their impacts on river reaches downstream of the hydropower system the descriptive approach is heavily conditioned on the observed hydropower operations for the definition of the target level and any definition of an alternative target level would be arbitrary this hinders the analysis on possible future evolution of water system dynamics under different scenarios the normative approach allows instead to explore how decision makers could adapt to future changes in the operating context by re designing the operating rule to account for changes in the drivers the analysis of the adapted operations shows that the fluctuations of the river flow downstream from the reservoir could be enhanced by 50 in fall and winter months and reduced by 30 in summer months thus exacerbating the well known negative hydropower impacts on downstream river regime these fluctuations persist even 80 km far from the reservoir these results confirm the importance of testing alternative decision making strategies to assess the range and uncertainties of the impacts induced by human activities under future scenarios this is particularly important in view of the need to reconcile improved hydropower production necessary to contribute the energy transition with the conservation of aquatic ecosystems necessary to avoid the loss of their important services the paper s results clearly show the potential of the normative approach in anticipating decision makers adaptations to future changes in addition this approach overcomes the issue of simulating predicting reservoir operations in systems where no observations of reservoir dynamics are available and consequently reservoir operating policies are unknown brown et al 2015 however when adopting this approach some key aspects and assumptions have to be considered first the correct definition of the objective function and the constraints is crucial for exploring a meaningful range of different human decisions second real world operations are rarely purely single objective as we assumed in this work but there might be other operating objectives which partly drive the operations for example in specific situations examples of extraordinary operating objectives could be in our case the satisfaction of electricity demands of particular clients third the assumption of full rationality of the decision maker should be examined carefully on each single case as some decision makers might not have a clear goal oriented decision making attitude see e g mason et al 2018 and references therein finally we implicitly assumed that the mechanisms underlying the decision making process for example the reservoir operating objective remain unchanged in the future i e they are not influenced by any change in the drivers this assumption might not always hold true and should be critically discussed case by case for example it is reasonable to assume that the main purpose of the hydropower operations will be the maximization of the revenue even in the future as we did in this work however it is also reasonable to assume that the reservoirs purely operated for hydropower purposes may be used under scenarios of increasing dry conditions and scarce water availability for other purposes such as urban or agricultural water supply even more in this case the normative approach could flexibly accommodate an analysis testing the impacts of different operating objectives by changing the formulation of the control problem in conclusion this study provides quantitative evidence of the need of carefully choosing the approach for simulating the response of catchments affected by human activities and infrastructure operations especially if the analysis focuses on future changing scenarios and adapted human controlled operations which replace historical decision making strategies a descriptive approach based on a target level is indeed easy to define and implement in any hydrological model as long as observations of the reservoir operations are available but fails in anticipating reservoir adaptation strategies conversely the normative approach is more powerful and general as it helps achieving a more accurate representation of the interplay among hydrological processes reservoir dynamics and the human controlled decision making process both when the focus is on reproducing historical operations and when exploring alternative operating strategies is needed credit authorship contribution statement
