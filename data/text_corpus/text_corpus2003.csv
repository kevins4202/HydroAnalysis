challenges have attracted more attention in most countries all over the world as a result of unsustainable and inappropriate exploitation of environmental resources engström et al 2008 lenschow et al 2016 fan et al 2018 the accelerated resource consumption and the constant abuse of nature associated with rapid climate change have negatively affected ecosystems recovery potentials chowdhary et al 2018 duckett et al 2016 on the other hand acceleration of global economic growth led to environmental problems and retrogression of ecosystem services and functions han et al 2021 in this context the united nations un launched the un 2030 agenda and its sustainable development goals sdgs to meet the eminent earth s challenges un 2015 the sdgs are an ambitious plan to achieve earths sustainability within various dimensions i e 17 sdgs with a special attention to land sdg 15 climate change sdg 13 and water sdg 6 un 2015 di baldassarre et al 2019 in a changing climate water availability and its efficient management sdg 6 is one of the urgent challenges that need to be addressed due to its direct or indirect role in achieving other sdgs for insuring sustainability el mageed et al 2017 di baldassarre et al 2019 jerin et al 2021 elbeltagi et al 2020e 2021 kumar et al 2021 mokhtar et al 2021 bajirao et al 2021 zerouali et al 2021 adnan et al 2021 suryakant et al 2021 hence proper management of water resources by using new approaches is a vital issue for achieving sdgs goals especially in arid and semi arid regions in this sense water footprint wf hoekstra 2008 could be one of the tools for meeting water security challenges especially in the agricultural sector elbeltagi et al 2020a the term wf firstly introduced is a method for quantifying the amount water that is used for producing one unit of a target product through the whole supply chain scientifically the wf is a combination between green wf rainfall r m3 blue wf evapotranspiration et r when et r m3 and gray wf water pollution quality neglected m3 lovarelli et al 2016 jamshidi et al 2020 since 85 of the global freshwater is consumed by agricultural sector mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 bhat et al 2017a 2017b elbeltagi et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d 2020e the wf was broadly employed in the agriculture sector to calculate water consumption environmental impact and investigate the better water management novoa et al 2019 nezamoleslami and hosseinian 2020 in this sense water footprint assessment wfa was previously applied in a global scale for maize liu et al 2017 wheat mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 crop production babaee et al 2021 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 hydropower animal products mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 and humanity hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 notably wfa research was carried out in many parts of the world for instance in morocco china zhai et al 2019 romania ene et al 2013 italy de girolamo et al 2019 south africa pahlow et al 2015 iran ababaei and etedali 2017 karandish and hoekstra 2017 turkey muratoglu 2019 and spain pellicer martínez and martínez paz 2016 so far many models were developed for wfa such as crop water use cwu model de miguel et al 2015 wfa approach hoekstra et al 2011 wf model nezamoleslami and hosseinian 2020 and wf hydrus karandish and šimůnek 2018 recently wfa was integrated with machine learning ml technique however holistic approach between wfa and machine learning is still emerging for example dai et al 2021 proposed a fuzzy modeling approach which enhanced wf under different levels of credibility mokarram et al 2021 used artificial neural networks anns for calculating wf and reported that radial basis function rbf has better estimation than other models interestingly elbeltagi et al 2020a developed an ann model for calculating wf in egyptian delta for maize where the result showed a high trustworthy outcome with low deviation even if the climate data were limited their findings observed that the combination of solar radiation vapor pressure deficit and humidity h was the best variables for predicting blue wf moreover elbeltagi et al 2020b studied the impact of climate changes on the future water footprint of two agro nomically important crops by applying deep neural networks dnn under three scenarios of climate changes in the proposed work we have presented new techniques in modeling wf easily without conducting field experiments no cost simple and achieve satisfactory result gaussian processes under four kernels as a rapid decision tools were developed to model blue wf in the study area as a new tool for water users and developers furthermore to our knowledge there are no studies available in the literature that model and simulate the wf in the semi arid regions using the processes of gaussian kernels egypt is located in the northern africa suffers from water shortage which reaches 13 5 24bm3 yr 1 due to arid climate rapid population growth 94 million and limited water resources 90 from nile river 55 5bm3 yr 1 allam et al 2015 mohie el din and moussa 2016 el essawy et al 2019 assar et al 2020 however water scarcity is the main challenges facing the agricultural sector and limiting crop production and national food security allam and allam 2007 el essawy et al 2019 nevertheless 50 of the labor forces working in agricultural sector contributed to about 23 of national gdp el essawy et al 2019 thus defining water consumption from main produced crops i e maize wheat and cotton is critical for efficient water management and sustainability of agricultural system elbeltagi et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d 2020e maize zea mays l spp is one of the important crops in egypt abdrabbo et al 2013 according to food and agriculture organization fao the cultivated area by maize is nearly about 1 1 m ha which is slightly higher than year 2019 by 2 72 regardless the efficiency of maize and other c4 crops in water use comparing to c3 crops begg and turner 1976 maize cultivation in egypt and especially in nile delta required a careful assessment of water balance and water use efficiency for sustainable production nonetheless few studies were carried out in the mediterranean region novoa et al 2019 and in egypt in particular for estimation blue wf of agricultural crops thus to bridge the gap in literature this work aims to 1 compare between the developed gpr models under different kernels in egyptian nile delta governorate and 2 select the best model and algorithm which achieve a high degree of accuracy and low error for predicting blue wf of maize 2 materials and methods 2 1

descriptive statistical analysis of the collected data for the dakahliyah region is shown in table 2 for whole datasets training and testing data periods 2 3 machine learning models gaussian process regression gpr mathematical model is non parametric kernel depend on the probabilistic model it is significant in the area of machine learning programming the main awareness of gpr is to adopt that the learning sample tracks the previous probabilities of the gaussian process regression it is computing the consistent subsequent probability the bayesian linear regression model is used to build it gpr usages the kernel to describe the covariance of a prior dispersal over the target functions and uses the detected training information to explain a likelihood function depend on the bayes theorem a gaussian posterior circulation over aim functions is an explained whose mean is a utilized for prediction of data the various variables has presented in the data such as tmax tmin tmean ws sh vpd sr ra h kc with collection of time series data set used for the prediction value the following equation was used for times series data set like tmax tmin tmean ws sh vpd sr ra h kc for the forecasting values the gathering of converted forecasters and predict and form a column vector z t z 1 z 2 z d z i n μ i σ i di is the dimension of forecaster and predict the combined gaussian distribution for

procedure when the combined dispersal of random variable as per the distribution of gaussian the interdependence of numerous converted forecasters and predictors is entirely characterized by the mean standard deviation vector and correlation matrix within the gaussian methods revert the converted variables zt is a divided into both sub vectors x t y t where x t and y t contain the forecasters and predict and respectively μ t μ x t μ x t x x x y y x y y there is a significant difference in characteristics working styles and other parameters in between the random processes and gaussian process predictors and forecasts provide non accurate data sets upon utilization of any random variable sun et al 2014 the principled practically and probabilistically based approach to kernel making was originally formulated by rasmussen and its staff gaussian method regression gpr the advantage of gpr over numerous others is to integrate hyper parameter estimates model training and insecurity assessments perfectly the results are less subjectively affected and more readable gaussian gp processes assume that the combined dispersal of model output probability is gaussian 2 3 1 polynomial kernel in the language of the machine learning the polynomial kernel is a kernel feature usually used with the support vector machines svms and other kernelized models which denotes vector parallel training samples in the original variables in a function space allowing learning of non linear models the polynomial kernel appears automatically not individually at the specified features of the input samples in order to obtain their resemblance but also mixtures of them such groupings are classified as interaction characteristics in the sense of regression analysis the contained polynomial kernel feature space is equivalent to that of a polynomial regression but the sum of parameters to be an educated without a combinative blow up when the input data of features are binary boolean then the features link to logical input function conjunctions for degree d polynomials the polynomial kernel is well defined as 6 k x y x t y c d where x and y are vectors in the input space i e vectors of features calculated from exercise or trial samples and c 0 is an unrestricted parameter trading off the approach of higher order versus lower order definitions in the polynomial when c 0 the kernel is known as homogeneous 2 3 2 pearson universal function kernel puk the puk kernel is used in the machine learning and it is helpful for the large data interpretation of various fields especially this kernel equation is very accurate predication related to climate and hydrological research the common form of the pearson vii function for curve suitable determination is given by 7 f x h 1 2 x x 0 2 1 w 1 δ 2 ω where h is the top height at the center x0 of the peak and x denotes the self determining variable the parameters σ and ω regulator the half width and the following factor of the peak however a function ω goes to the class of effective kernel functions individual if its consistent kernel matrix is symmetric and positive semi definite to display that the pufk definitely contents these situations uestuen redrafted eq 1 into a function of both vectors 8 k x i x j 1 1 2 x i x j 2 2 1 ω 1 σ 2 ω where x i and x j are both vector arguments the highest off set define x 0 in equation is adeleted and the topmost height h is easy changed by 1 this without damage of simplification in this direction the pearson vii function kernel will main to a symmetric matrix with ones on the diagonal and whole additional entries ranging between the values 0 and 1 for any arbitrary pair xi and xj the pufk is healthy and has an equal or even stronger plotting power as related to the standard kernel functions which mean to an equal or better generalization performance of svms the weka package was used to create the algorithms and execute them overall the successively parameters of the classifiers were set as the defaults 2 3 3 normalized poly kernel normalized poly kernel classifiers utilized in machine learning and data mining it may be used for the predication of data in the various fields now a day s machine learning technology is used on the large data set analysis with ai drone and robotics build by machine learning programming the metrological and remote sensing data is a very big data and it is not accurate information by traditional methods but as compared to machine learning with kernels classification can be given more accurate information the normalization polynomial kernel of the vectors of the initial space can be agreed as the most basic kind of preprocessing x r n is an input vector the consistent normalized vector x can be described as 9 x x x r n where x 2 1 n x i 2 this vector lies on a unit hypersphere of r n normalization in a feature space is not harshly talking a kind of pre processing because it is not clearly useful to input vectors but can be seen as a kernel illustration of the pre processing considered above i e an extension of the input vector normalization feature space in the function space normalization fundamentally corresponds to redefining the svm s kernel functions as it is functional to the unrefined input vectors moreover since non linear plotting is not recognized this normalization only uses the kernel functions accept the k x y is the kernel function on behalf of a dot product in the feature space normalization in the feature space then number to describing a new kernel function k x y as respectively 10 k x y k x y k x y k x y ϵ r 2 3 4 radial basis function rbf kernel the rbf kernel is a common kernel feature used in different kernel learning algorithms in machine training it is broadly utilized in the classification of vector machines the rbf kernel is usually a reasonable first option this kernel maps samples into higher dimensional spaces which implies that in contrast to the linear kernel it can deal with a non linear relation between class labels and attributes in addition rbf is a different situation in the linear kernel normalized poly kernel since the linear kernel with a penalty parameter c has performs with parameters the same as the rbf kernel c y furthermore in certain parameters the sigmoid kernel is like rbfone important idea is 0 k ij 1 in comparison kernel values can be used to γ x i t r 1 for polynomial kernels to infinity as long as the grade is high in addition the sigmoid kernel cannot be true in such parameters i e not an internal product of two vectors some situations are not appropriate for the rbf kernel in particular the linear kernel can be used when the numeral of features is extremely high the proposed methodology for the combination of all data to develop ten models based on the four gpr kernels used is described in table 3 ten scenarios consisting of various combinations of the climatic variables were investigated for their effects on blue wf to provide an accurate estimation for the area with data scarcity table 3 this may help improve wf analysis for data scarcity regions and also to evaluate the contribution of each climate variable to the wf the combination method applied in this study has been used by previous researchers mehdizadeh et al 2020 mokhtar et al 2021 training and testing periods were from 2000 to 2014 and from 2015 to 2019 respectively 2 4 performance metrics and evaluation actual data of blue wf and modeled values were compared through the period of this study to evaluate the accuracy of models the following statistical indicators have been selected using root mean square error coefficient of determination and mean absolute error malone et al 2017 elbeltagi et al 2020b 2020a 2020d all parameters defined as follows wf a i is an observed or actual value wf p i is simulated or foreseen value w f is the mean value of reference samples and n is the total number of data points 1 root mean square error rmse is the sample standard deviation of the differences between foreseen and actual values it is given by 11 rmse 1 n i 1 n wfi a i wf p i 2 2 mean absolute error the mean absolute error evaluates the mean magnitude of the errors in a set of forecasts without considering their sign it s an average over the test sample of the absolute differences between foreseen and actual values it is defined as 12 mae 1 n i 1 n wf p i wf a i 3 relative absolute error the relative absolute error takes the total absolute error and normalizes it by dividing by the total absolute error of the simple predictor 13 rae wf a i wf p i wf p i 100 4 root relative squared error the relative squared error takes the total squared error and normalizes it by dividing by the total squared error of the simple predictor by taking the square root of the relative squared error one reduces the error to the same dimensions as the quantity being predicted 14 rrse i 1 n wf p i wf a i 2

each other it can be determined using the following formula 15 r i 1 n q o q o q p q p i 1 n q o q o 2 i 1 n q p q p 2 where q o is the average of the observed values q p is the average of the predicted values 3 results and discussion in this study different meteorological data were combined in 10 scenarios as inputs into the gpr to model the blue wf of maize performance of four different kernels including poly kernel rbf kernel puk kernel and normalized poly kernel in gpr model are presented from tables 4 to 7 respectively for training and testing periods as table 4 shows by increasing the number of meteorological variables in gpr in the poly kernel the amount of error in all 4 indexes of rmse mae rae and rrse in predicting the blue wf has decreased and the value of the correlation index between the actual and the predicted values correlation coefficient has increased so that the best performance is related to model 10 with complete inputs of tmax tmin tmean ws sh vpd sr ra h kc with relative absolute error of about 33 in the test period and the weakest performance is related to model 1 with input of tmax with rae value of about 93 in the test period similar to this results carter and liang 2019 in evaluation of ten machine learning methods such as gpr for estimating evapotranspiration as an effective parameter in calculating wf showed that inclusion of more input variables improved algorithm performance table 5 indicates the rbf kernel results in predicting the blue wf in which model 10 has the lowest mae rae rrse rmse and the highest correlation coefficient compared to other models in the test period in addition the model 1 has the worst predicted results in the rbf kernel as in the poly kernel comparison of poly kernel and rbf kernel illustrates that poly kernel with relative absolute error of about 33 has a better performance in predicting water wf compared to rbf kernel with rae value of 88 5 the results of table 4 demonstrate that model 3 with inputs of tmax tmin and tmean model 4 with inputs of tmax tmin tmean and ws model 5 with inputs of tmax tmin tmean ws and sh model 6 with inputs of tmax tmin tmean ws sh and vpd model 7 with inputs of tmax tmin tmean ws sh vpd and sr model 8 with inputs of tmax tmin tmean ws sh vpd sr and ra and model 9 with inputs of tmax tmin tmean ws sh vpd sr ra and h have almost the same performance with a little difference compared to model 10 in predicting blue wf therefore in this kernel less available inputs can be used to predict blue wf with the same accuracy as full inputs however the rbf kernel error is high so that the relative absolute error of the best rbf model model 10 with full inputs is more than model 2 in poly kernel with inputs of tmax and tmin the results of performance evaluation of puk kernel in prediction of blue wf in table 6 show that in this kernel model 7 gives the best performance with tmax tmin tmean ws sh vpd and sr inputs however the results of model 7 are close to models 8 with inputs of model 7 plus ra model 9 with inputs of model 7 plus ra and h and model 10 with full inputs therefore if there is no access to any of these inputs model 7 with fewer inputs and more accuracy can be used in fact in this kernel there is a leap in improving the prediction performance in model 7 and later compared to previous models furthermore the comparison of puk kernel results with rbf kernel which had the worst results so far indicates that the weakest puk kernel model model 1 with input of tmax by relative absolute error of 60 6 performed better than the best rbf kernel model model 10 with full inputs and relative absolute error of 88 5 the performance of this kernel in predicting blue wf is better than the other two kernels the results of normalized poly kernel prediction in table 7 illustrated that this kernel has better performance than rbf model in which the best model of normalized poly kernel is model 10 with 39 relative absolute error but has worse performance than poly and puk kernels in general the performance of the puk kernel in predicting blue wf is better than the other three kernels then the poly kernel the normalized poly kernel and finally the rbf kernel are in the next ranks respectively the results of this study showed the proper performance of the gpr model in prediction of blue wf with r 0 95 with a combination of tmax tmin tmean ws sh vpd sr ra h and kc as inputs elbeltagi et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d 2020e in their research also obtained good results in predicting maize blue wf with r 0 95 with combinations of tmean ws sr vpd h kc and soil moisture sm parameters as ann model input in different regions the obtained correlation coefficient of the present study was better than the mlp ann model with r2 0 752 in the research of predicting maize wf some research has also shown the proper performance of the gpr model in predicting crop yield and evapotranspiration which are involved in calculating blue wf in its research indicated that among the four machine learning methods backpropagation neural network decision tree k nearest neighbor regression and gpr the gaussian process regression gpr algorithm performed best and estimated yield with r2 0 84 deo and samui 2017 in forecasting evaporative loss using gaussian process regression gpr minimax probability machine regression mpmr and genetic programming gp models illustrated that correlation coefficient of 0 875 0 864 and 0 628 were attained between the observed and forecasted ep in gpr mpmr and gp models respectively figs 2 5 indicate a graphical comparison of the observed and predicted values of blue wf in the model 10 in different kernels the results of these figures demonstrate that the order of best to poor performance is related to the puk kernel poly kernel the normalized poly kernel and the rbf kernel respectively the scattering of points around the 1 1 line in the poly kernel at the training period fig 2 shows that this kernel is overestimated in small and medium values and underestimated in large values with more error in the rbf kernel fig 3 the slope of the fitting line between actual and predicted values is very low and close to zero it means that for a specific change in the range of actual values from about 2 16 m3 kg a small change in predicted values are observed from about 6 8 m3 kg similar to these results more error of the rbf kernel compared to the puk kernel has been shown in the research in modeling of infiltration of sandy soil using gaussian process regression in addition these findings are in agreement with the results who found that the puk kernel generated high correlation coefficient and low statistical errors compared to other kernels used for modeling the impact of water quality on recharging rate of storm water filter system as well these results coincide with the observations of kumar et al 2019 who found a high linear relationship using the puk kernel r2 1 and 0 87 during training and testing phases for estimating the oxygen transfer performance of plunging hollow jet aerator comparison of predicted and actual values of the blue wf in model 10 with full input and model 7 with inputs of tmax tmin tmean ws sh vpd and sr in the puk kernel is shown in fig 4 as these figures illustrate both models 10 and 7 in this kernel have good results in predicting blue wf slope of less than zero in all four kernels indicates overestimation of these models in small values and underestimation in large values in which the puk kernel have less error than other kernels comparison of the relative absolute error in four kernels in different models in fig 6 shows that the rbf kernel has a large error in all models in contrast the puk kernel has less error than other kernels the differences between models 4 5 and 6 and also models 7 8 9 and 10 with each other are small in puk kernel poly kernel and normalized poly kernel start in models with fewer inputs with large errors up to rbf kernel error and then gradually decrease the error from model 7 onwards a jump in error reduction is observed in both of them which decreases to close to the puk kernel error so that as model 10 is concerned the poly kernel error reaches to less than the puk kernel the error of poly kernel and normalized poly kernel is slightly different a comparison of the error ep in different actual values in the model 10 is shown in fig 7 in four kernels as this figure indicates in all four kernels the error rate in small blue wf values is higher than the other values at medium blue wf values the error value decreases and then at large values the error value increases again in all range of blue wf values the rbf kernel error rate is higher than other kernels the alternative model model 7 behaves similarly to model 10 in this regard fig 8 most errors in this model are also related to the rbf kernel however in the puk kernel a smaller error is observed in both models 10 and 7 the scatter of errors in the poly kernel and normalized poly kernel is greater especially in smaller blue wf values this dispersion is less in the puk and rbf kernels in this study the use of meteorological parameters of tmax tmin tmean ws sh vpd sr ra hand kc had accurate results in predicting the blue wf elbeltagi et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d 2020e in their research showed that the models with sr h and vpd tmean crop coefficient kc and h and sm ws vpd and kc were the best anns in predicting wfb of maize in the three egyptian nile delta governorates furthermore ahmadi et al 2021 investigated the main effect of climate change on maize yield and water footprint wf in qazvin plain using aqua crop and lars wg models which have the climate parameters used in this study moreover elbeltagi et al 2020c applied deep neural networks dnn method in simulating future wf based on these variables and stated that their results will help in optimal planning of future water under climate change in the agricultural sector due to the effect of yield and evapotranspiration on the blue wf the parameters that affect these two variables can be used as predictor parameters of blue wf and lead to appropriate predictions similar climate parameters of this research were utilized in some other studies in modeling reference evapotranspiration pan evaporation using gpr model such as temperature t relative humidity rh wind speed w and sunshine hours s in the research mean air temperature tmean maximum air temperature tmax minimum air temperature tmin wind speed u relative humidity rh and solar radiation rs or extraterrestrial radiation ra in han et al 2019 and mean temperature wind speed sunshine hours and rain in the other study used different combination of climate data such as tmin tmax ra rs vpd rh and average wind speed as inputs parameters in evaluation of multivariate linear regression for reference evapotranspiration modeling furthermore utilization of meteorological variables as input in predicting crop yield using different ann regression models had also appropriate results nearing et al 2013 using mean maximum and minimum daily temperature the number of wet days per month the total monthly precipitation and the mean and standard deviation of daily net radiation data khaki and wang 2019 using precipitation solar radiation vapor pressure maximum temperature and minimum temperature and using land surface temperature and precipitation this research demonstrated a practical application of machine learning methods in predicting blue wf of maize in egyptian nile delta governorate previous researches have pointed to the use of soft computing techniques in different fields of water resources engineering such as prediction of rainfall wu and chau 2013 homsi et al 2020 estimation of prediction intervals pi of streamflow discharges taormina and chau 2015 investigation of reservoir operation under climate change conditions ehteram et al 2018 monitoring drought of southwestern china zhao et al 2018 and evaluation the impact of climate change on extreme hydrological events in a semi arid catchment sharafati and pezeshki 2020 based on the importance of timely and reliable prediction of water footprint in increasing the security of water and food supply accurate forecasting is essential developed models in this study and their findings can help the decision makers in precise prediction of water footprint and proper management of the agricultural water resources 4 conclusion in this study we have developed four kernels in gpr models based on ten scenarios from meteorological variables including tmax tmin tmean ws sh vpd sr ra h and kc in order to select the best kernel with scenario for predicting blue wf of maize in egyptian nile delta governorate during the period from 2000 to 2019 overall the performance of the puk kernel in predicting blue wf is the best kernel followed by the poly kernel the normalized poly kernel and finally the rbf kernel for the 10 scenarios by increasing the number of meteorological variables the amount of error in all 4 indexes of rmse mae rae and rrse in predicting the blue wf has decreased and the value of the correlation index correlation coefficient has increased our findings demonstrated that using meteorological parameters such as tmax tmin tmean ws sh vpd sr ra h and kc have an accurate result in predicting the blue wf therefore the finding from the current study can be a raid decision tool for government to ensure the sustainable agricultural water management in the semi arid areas on contrast more periods of the climate data are needed in order to estimate the blue wf for long period further not only climate variables are impacted on blue wf but also agricultural and management data are essential in the prediction of blue wf therefore in the future studies more predictors need to be considered for better

challenges have attracted more attention in most countries all over the world as a result of unsustainable and inappropriate exploitation of environmental resources engström et al 2008 lenschow et al 2016 fan et al 2018 the accelerated resource consumption and the constant abuse of nature associated with rapid climate change have negatively affected ecosystems recovery potentials chowdhary et al 2018 duckett et al 2016 on the other hand acceleration of global economic growth led to environmental problems and retrogression of ecosystem services and functions han et al 2021 in this context the united nations un launched the un 2030 agenda and its sustainable development goals sdgs to meet the eminent earth s challenges un 2015 the sdgs are an ambitious plan to achieve earths sustainability within various dimensions i e 17 sdgs with a special attention to land sdg 15 climate change sdg 13 and water sdg 6 un 2015 di baldassarre et al 2019 in a changing climate water availability and its

management of water resources by using new approaches is a vital issue for achieving sdgs goals especially in arid and semi arid regions in this sense water footprint wf hoekstra 2008 could be one of the tools for meeting water security challenges especially in the agricultural sector elbeltagi et al 2020a the term wf firstly introduced is a method for quantifying the amount water that is used for producing one unit of a target product through the whole supply chain scientifically the wf is a combination between green wf rainfall r m3 blue wf evapotranspiration et r when et r m3 and gray wf water pollution quality neglected m3 lovarelli et al 2016 jamshidi et al 2020 since 85 of the global freshwater is consumed by agricultural sector mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 bhat et al 2017a 2017b elbeltagi et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d 2020e the wf was broadly employed in the agriculture sector to calculate water consumption environmental impact and investigate the better water management novoa et al 2019 nezamoleslami and hosseinian 2020 in this sense water footprint assessment wfa was previously applied in a global scale for maize liu et al 2017 wheat mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 crop

wf model nezamoleslami and hosseinian 2020 and wf hydrus karandish and šimůnek 2018 recently wfa was integrated with machine learning ml technique however holistic approach between wfa and machine learning is still emerging for example dai et al 2021 proposed a fuzzy modeling approach which enhanced wf under different levels of credibility mokarram et al 2021 used artificial neural networks anns for calculating wf and reported that radial basis function rbf has better estimation than other models interestingly elbeltagi et al 2020a developed an ann model for calculating wf in egyptian delta for maize where the result showed a high trustworthy outcome with low deviation even if the climate data were limited their findings observed that the combination of solar radiation vapor pressure deficit and humidity h was the best variables for predicting blue wf moreover elbeltagi et al 2020b studied the impact of climate changes on the future water footprint of two agro nomically important crops by applying deep neural networks dnn under three scenarios of climate changes in the proposed work we have presented new techniques in modeling wf easily without conducting field experiments no cost simple and achieve satisfactory result gaussian processes under four kernels as a rapid decision tools were developed to model blue wf in the study area as a new tool for water users and developers furthermore to our knowledge there are no studies available in the literature that model and simulate the wf in the semi arid regions using the processes of gaussian kernels egypt is located in the northern africa suffers from water shortage which reaches 13 5 24bm3 yr 1 due to arid climate rapid population growth 94 million and limited water resources 90 from nile river 55

especially in nile delta required a careful assessment of water balance and water use efficiency for sustainable production nonetheless few studies were carried out in the mediterranean region novoa et al 2019 and in egypt in particular for estimation blue wf of agricultural crops thus to bridge the gap in literature this work aims to 1 compare between the developed gpr models under different kernels in egyptian nile delta governorate and 2 select the best model and algorithm which achieve a high degree of accuracy and low error for predicting blue wf of maize 2 materials and methods 2 1

descriptive statistical analysis of the collected data for the dakahliyah region is shown in table 2 for whole datasets training and testing data periods 2 3 machine learning models gaussian process regression gpr mathematical model is non parametric kernel depend on the probabilistic model it is significant in the area of machine learning programming the main awareness of gpr is to adopt that the learning sample tracks the previous probabilities of the gaussian process regression it is computing the consistent subsequent probability the bayesian linear regression model is used to build it gpr usages the kernel to describe the covariance of a prior dispersal over the target functions and uses the detected training information to explain a likelihood function depend on the bayes theorem a gaussian posterior circulation over aim functions is an explained whose mean is a utilized for prediction of data the various variables has presented in the data such as tmax tmin tmean ws sh vpd sr ra h kc with collection of time series data set used for the prediction value the following equation was used for times series data set like tmax tmin tmean ws sh vpd sr ra h kc for the forecasting

procedure when the combined dispersal of random variable as per the distribution of gaussian the interdependence of numerous converted forecasters and predictors is entirely characterized by the mean standard deviation vector and correlation matrix within the gaussian methods revert the converted variables zt is a divided into both sub vectors x t y t where x t and y t contain the forecasters and predict and respectively μ t μ x t μ x t x x x y y x y y there is a significant difference in characteristics working styles and other parameters in between the random processes and gaussian process predictors and forecasts provide non accurate data sets upon utilization of any random variable sun et al 2014 the principled practically and probabilistically based approach to kernel making was originally formulated by rasmussen and its staff gaussian method regression gpr the advantage of gpr over numerous others is to integrate hyper parameter estimates model training and insecurity assessments perfectly the results are less subjectively affected and more readable gaussian gp processes assume that the combined dispersal of model output probability is gaussian 2 3 1 polynomial kernel in the language of the machine learning the polynomial kernel is a kernel feature usually used with the support vector machines svms and other kernelized models which denotes vector parallel training samples in the original variables in a function space allowing learning of non linear models the polynomial kernel appears automatically not individually at the specified features of the input samples in order to obtain their resemblance but also mixtures of them such groupings are classified as interaction characteristics in the sense of regression analysis the contained polynomial kernel feature space is equivalent to that of a polynomial regression but the sum of parameters to be an educated without a combinative blow up when the input data of features are binary boolean then the features link to logical input function conjunctions for degree d polynomials the polynomial kernel is well defined as 6 k x y x t y c d where x and y are vectors in the input space i e vectors of features calculated from exercise or trial samples and c 0 is an unrestricted parameter trading off the approach of higher order versus lower order definitions in the polynomial when c 0 the kernel is known as homogeneous 2 3 2 pearson universal function kernel puk the puk kernel is used in the machine learning and it is helpful for the large data interpretation of various fields especially this kernel equation is very accurate predication related to climate and hydrological research the common form of the pearson vii function for curve suitable determination is given by 7 f x h 1 2 x x 0 2 1 w 1 δ 2 ω where h is the top height at the center x0 of the peak and x denotes the self determining variable the parameters σ and ω regulator the half width and the following factor of the peak however a function ω goes to the class of effective kernel functions individual if its consistent kernel matrix is symmetric and positive semi definite to display that the pufk definitely contents these situations uestuen redrafted eq 1 into a function of both vectors 8 k x i x j 1 1 2 x i x j 2 2 1 ω 1 σ 2 ω where x i and x j are both vector arguments the highest off set define x 0 in equation is adeleted and the topmost height h is easy changed by 1 this without damage of simplification in this direction the pearson vii function kernel will main to a symmetric matrix with ones on the diagonal and whole additional entries ranging between the values 0 and 1 for any arbitrary pair xi and xj the pufk is healthy and has an equal or even stronger plotting power as related to the standard kernel functions which mean to an equal or better generalization performance of svms the weka package was used to create the algorithms and execute them overall the successively parameters of the classifiers were set as the defaults 2 3 3 normalized poly kernel normalized poly kernel classifiers utilized in machine learning and data mining it may be used for the predication of data in the various fields now a day s machine learning technology is used on the large data set analysis with ai drone and robotics build by machine learning programming the metrological and remote sensing data is a very big data and it is not accurate information by traditional methods but as compared to machine learning with kernels classification can be given more accurate information the normalization polynomial kernel of the vectors of the initial space can be agreed as the most basic kind of preprocessing x r n is an input vector the consistent normalized vector x can be described as 9 x x x r n where x 2 1 n x i 2 this vector lies on a unit hypersphere of r n normalization in a feature space is not harshly talking a kind of pre processing because it is not clearly useful to input vectors but can be seen as a kernel illustration of the pre processing considered above i e an extension of the input vector normalization feature space in the function space normalization fundamentally corresponds to redefining the svm s kernel functions as it is functional to the unrefined input vectors moreover since non linear plotting is not recognized this normalization only uses the kernel functions accept the k x y is the kernel function on behalf of a dot product in the feature space normalization in the feature space then number to describing a new kernel function k x y as respectively 10 k x y k x y k x y k x y ϵ r 2 3 4 radial basis function rbf kernel the rbf kernel is a common kernel feature used in different kernel learning algorithms in machine training it is broadly utilized in the classification of vector machines the rbf kernel is usually a reasonable first option this kernel maps samples into higher dimensional spaces which implies that in contrast to the linear kernel it can deal with a non linear relation between class labels and attributes in addition rbf is a different situation in the linear kernel normalized poly kernel since the linear kernel with a penalty parameter c has performs with parameters the same as the rbf kernel c y furthermore in certain parameters the sigmoid kernel is like rbfone important idea is 0 k ij 1 in comparison kernel values can be used to γ x i t r 1 for polynomial kernels to infinity as long as the grade is high in addition the sigmoid kernel cannot be true in such parameters i e not an internal product of two vectors some situations are not appropriate for the rbf kernel in particular the linear kernel can be used when the numeral of features is extremely high the proposed methodology for the combination of all data to develop ten models based on the four gpr kernels used is described in table 3 ten scenarios consisting of various combinations of the climatic variables were investigated for their effects on blue wf to provide an accurate estimation for the area with data scarcity table 3 this may help improve wf analysis for data scarcity regions and also to evaluate the contribution of each climate variable to the wf the combination method applied in this study has been used by previous researchers mehdizadeh et al 2020 mokhtar et al 2021 training and testing periods were from 2000 to 2014 and from 2015 to 2019 respectively 2 4 performance metrics and evaluation actual data of blue wf and modeled values were compared through the period of this study to evaluate the accuracy of models the following statistical indicators have been selected using root mean square error coefficient of determination and mean absolute error malone et al 2017 elbeltagi et al 2020b 2020a 2020d all parameters defined as follows wf a i is an observed or actual value wf p i is simulated or foreseen value w f is the mean value of reference samples and n is the total number of data points 1 root mean square error rmse is the sample standard deviation of the differences between foreseen and actual values it is given by 11 rmse 1 n i 1 n wfi a i wf p i 2 2 mean absolute error the mean absolute error evaluates the mean magnitude of the errors in a set of forecasts without considering their sign it s an average over the test sample of the absolute differences between foreseen and actual values it is defined as 12 mae 1 n i 1 n wf p i wf a i 3 relative absolute error the relative absolute error takes the total absolute error and normalizes it by dividing by the total

each other it can be determined using the following formula 15 r i 1 n q o q o q p q p i 1 n q o q o 2 i 1 n q p q p 2 where q o is the average of the observed values q p is the average of the predicted values 3 results and discussion in this study different meteorological data were combined in 10 scenarios as inputs into the gpr to model the blue wf of maize performance of four different kernels including poly kernel rbf kernel puk kernel and normalized poly kernel in gpr model are presented from tables 4 to 7 respectively for training and testing periods as table 4 shows by increasing the number of meteorological variables in gpr in the poly kernel the amount of error in all 4 indexes of rmse mae rae and rrse in predicting the blue wf has decreased and the value of the correlation index between the actual and the predicted values correlation coefficient has increased so that the best performance is related to model 10 with complete inputs of tmax tmin tmean ws sh vpd sr ra h kc with relative absolute error of about 33 in the test period and the weakest performance is related to model 1 with input of tmax with rae value of about 93 in the test period similar to this results carter and liang 2019 in evaluation of ten machine learning methods such as gpr for estimating evapotranspiration as an effective parameter in calculating wf showed that inclusion of more input variables improved algorithm performance table 5 indicates the rbf kernel results in predicting the blue wf in which model 10 has the lowest mae rae rrse rmse and the highest correlation coefficient compared to other models in the test period in addition the model 1 has the worst predicted results in the rbf kernel as in the poly kernel comparison of poly kernel and rbf kernel illustrates that poly kernel with relative absolute error of about 33 has a better performance in predicting water wf compared to rbf kernel with rae value of 88 5 the results of table 4 demonstrate that model 3 with inputs of tmax tmin and tmean model 4 with inputs of tmax tmin tmean and ws model 5 with inputs of tmax tmin tmean ws and sh model 6 with inputs of tmax tmin tmean ws sh and vpd model 7 with inputs of tmax tmin tmean ws sh vpd and sr model 8 with inputs of tmax tmin tmean ws sh vpd sr and ra and model 9 with inputs of tmax tmin tmean ws sh vpd sr ra and h have almost the same performance with a little difference compared to model 10 in predicting blue wf therefore in this kernel less available inputs can be used to predict blue wf with the same accuracy as full inputs however the rbf kernel error is high so that the relative absolute error of the best rbf model model 10 with full inputs is more than model 2 in poly kernel with inputs of tmax and tmin the results of performance evaluation of puk kernel in prediction of blue wf in table 6 show that in this kernel model 7 gives the best performance with tmax tmin tmean ws sh vpd and sr inputs however the results of model 7 are close to models 8 with inputs of model 7 plus ra model 9 with inputs of model 7 plus ra and h and model 10 with full inputs therefore if there is no access to any of these inputs model 7 with fewer inputs and more accuracy can be used in fact in this kernel there is a leap in improving the prediction performance in model 7 and later compared to previous models furthermore the comparison of puk kernel results with rbf kernel which had the worst results so far indicates that the weakest puk kernel model model 1 with input of tmax by relative absolute error of 60 6 performed better than the best rbf kernel model model 10 with full inputs and relative absolute error of 88 5 the performance of this kernel in predicting blue wf is better than the other two kernels the results of normalized poly kernel prediction in table 7 illustrated that this kernel has better performance than rbf model in which the best model of normalized poly kernel is model 10 with 39 relative absolute error but has worse performance than poly and puk kernels in general the performance of the puk kernel in predicting blue wf is better than the other three kernels then the poly kernel the normalized poly kernel and finally the rbf kernel are in the next ranks respectively the results of this study showed the proper performance of the gpr model in prediction of blue wf with r 0 95 with a combination of tmax tmin tmean ws sh vpd sr ra h and kc as inputs elbeltagi et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d 2020e in their research also obtained good results in predicting maize blue wf with r 0 95 with combinations of tmean ws sr vpd h kc and soil moisture sm parameters as ann model input in different regions the obtained correlation coefficient of the present study was better than the mlp ann model with r2 0 752 in the research of predicting maize wf some research has also shown the proper performance of the gpr model in predicting crop yield and evapotranspiration which are involved in calculating blue wf in its research indicated that among the four machine learning methods backpropagation neural network decision tree k nearest neighbor regression and gpr the gaussian process regression gpr algorithm performed best and estimated yield with r2 0 84 deo and samui 2017 in forecasting evaporative loss using gaussian process regression gpr minimax probability machine regression mpmr and genetic programming gp models illustrated that correlation coefficient of 0 875 0 864 and 0 628 were attained between the observed and forecasted ep in gpr mpmr and gp models respectively figs 2 5 indicate a graphical comparison of the observed and predicted values of blue wf in the model 10 in different kernels the results of these figures demonstrate that the order of best to poor performance is related to the puk kernel poly kernel the normalized poly kernel and the rbf kernel respectively the scattering of points around the 1 1 line in the poly kernel at the training period fig 2 shows that this kernel is overestimated in small and medium values and underestimated in large values with more error in the rbf kernel fig 3 the slope of the fitting line between actual and predicted values is very low and close to zero it means that for a specific change in the range of actual values from about 2 16 m3 kg a small change in predicted values are observed from about 6 8 m3 kg similar to these results more error of the rbf kernel compared to the puk kernel has been shown in the research in modeling of infiltration of sandy soil using gaussian process regression in addition these findings are in agreement with the results who found that the puk kernel generated high correlation coefficient and low statistical errors compared to other kernels used for modeling the impact of water quality on recharging rate of storm water filter system as well these results coincide with the observations of kumar et al 2019 who found a high linear relationship using the puk kernel r2 1 and 0 87 during training and testing phases for estimating the oxygen transfer performance of plunging hollow jet aerator comparison of predicted and actual values of the blue wf in model 10 with full input and model 7 with inputs of tmax tmin tmean ws sh vpd and sr in the puk kernel is shown in fig 4 as these figures illustrate both models 10 and 7 in this kernel have good results in predicting blue wf slope of less than zero in all four kernels indicates overestimation of these models in small values and underestimation in large values in which the puk kernel have less error than other kernels comparison of the relative absolute error in four kernels in different models in fig 6 shows that the rbf kernel has a large error in all models in contrast the puk kernel has less error than other kernels the differences between models 4 5 and 6 and also models 7 8 9 and 10 with each other are small in puk kernel poly kernel and normalized poly kernel start in models with fewer inputs with large errors up to rbf kernel error and then gradually decrease the error from model 7 onwards a jump in error reduction is observed in both of them which decreases to close to the puk kernel error so that as model 10 is concerned the poly kernel error reaches to less than the puk kernel the error of poly kernel and normalized poly kernel is slightly different a comparison of the error ep in different actual values in the model 10 is shown in fig 7 in four kernels as this figure indicates in all four kernels the error rate in small blue wf values is higher than the other values at medium blue wf values the error value decreases and then at large values the error value increases again in all range of blue wf values the rbf kernel error rate is higher than other kernels the alternative model model 7 behaves similarly to model 10 in this regard fig 8 most errors in this model are also related to the rbf kernel however in the puk kernel a smaller error is observed in both models 10 and 7 the scatter of errors in the poly kernel and normalized poly kernel is greater especially in smaller blue wf values this dispersion is less in the puk and rbf kernels in this study the use of meteorological parameters of tmax tmin tmean ws sh vpd sr ra hand kc had accurate results in predicting the blue wf elbeltagi et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d 2020e in their research showed that the models with sr h and vpd tmean crop coefficient kc and h and sm ws vpd and kc were the best anns in predicting wfb of maize in the three egyptian nile delta governorates furthermore ahmadi et al 2021 investigated the main effect of climate change on maize yield and water footprint wf in qazvin plain using aqua crop and lars wg models which have the climate parameters used in this study moreover elbeltagi et al 2020c applied deep neural networks dnn method in simulating future wf based on these variables and stated that their results will help in optimal planning of future water under climate change in the agricultural sector due to the effect of yield and evapotranspiration on the blue wf the parameters that affect these two variables can be used as predictor parameters of blue wf and lead to appropriate predictions similar climate parameters of this research were utilized in some other studies in modeling reference evapotranspiration pan

developed models in this study and their findings can help the decision makers in precise prediction of water footprint and proper management of the agricultural water resources 4 conclusion in this study we have developed four kernels in gpr models based on ten scenarios from meteorological variables including tmax tmin tmean ws sh vpd sr ra h and kc in order to select the best kernel with

followed by the poly kernel the normalized poly kernel and finally the rbf kernel for the 10 scenarios by increasing the number of meteorological variables the amount of error in all 4 indexes of rmse mae rae and rrse in predicting the blue wf has decreased and the value of the correlation index correlation coefficient has increased our findings demonstrated that using meteorological parameters such as tmax tmin tmean ws sh vpd sr ra h and kc have an accurate result in predicting the blue wf therefore the finding from the current study can be a raid decision tool for government to ensure the sustainable agricultural water management in the semi arid areas on contrast more periods of the climate data are needed in order to estimate the blue wf for long period further not only climate variables are impacted on blue wf but also agricultural and management data are essential in the prediction of blue wf therefore in the future studies more predictors need to be considered for better

10016,the contribution of wastewater irrigation with the improvement of irrigation practices to the productivity of silage maize is a priority issue to investigate considering the saving of scarce freshwater resources and the necessity to dispose wastewater the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different irrigation levels l100 l67 and l33 of recycled municipal wastewater rw compared to freshwater fw using subsurface drip ssdi surface drip sdi and furrow irrigation fi methods on yield and some physiological traits of silage maize in semi arid conditions at a high altitude when the total daily reference evapotranspiration value reached 50 5 mm irrigation quantities corresponding to 100 67 and 33 of soil moisture deficit based on field capacity in fully irrigated plots with freshwater were applied in different irrigation levels crop actual evapotranspiration eta values were found close in both water types ssdi reduced eta by 18 5 and 45 6 in l100 level 15 2 and 38 9 in l67 and 11 6 and 32 6 in l33 respectively compared to sdi and fi the highest fresh biomass yield was determined in the ssdi rw l100 combination as 77 55 t ha 1 and resulted in 5 and 12 9 higher values than in sdi and fi leaf relative chlorophyll and water contents leaf area index and electrolyte leakage showed strong linear correlations with yield and evapotranspiration values the highest water productivity was determined in the ssdi rw l100 combination as 21 48 kg m 3 and it was higher by 28 2 and 99 4 than those in sdi and fi respectively improvement of productivity with increased irrigation quantities in ssdi delivered the high yield response factor of 1 70 1 77 therefore it is concluded that the ssdi method can be a successful practice to improve productivity by alleviating the need for water for silage maize especially under full irrigation with rw keywords deficit irrigation drip furrow physiological traits recycled wastewater yield response factor 1 introduction silage maize is one of the most important fodder crops due to its high nutritive value as well as its extensive adaptability to varied agro climatic conditions chaudhary et al 2014 maize world production was 1 148 billion tonnes in an area of 193 7 million ha in 2018 and the average production was 5 926 7 kg ha 1 fao 2020 in turkey silage maize production area total production and average fresh biomass yield was 0 461 million ha 23 2 million tonnes and 50 325 kg ha 1 for the same year respectively tsi 2020a drought significantly reduces yield and the quality of silage maize nilahyane et al 2020 freshwater resources are limited in many arid and semi arid regions in turkey growers are looking for more water saving irrigation practices and alternative water resources due to increasing concerns about the sustainable use of limited fresh water resources in the country the amount of recycled wastewater discharges from the wastewater treatment plants in turkey was 4 24 billion m3 in 2018 tsi 2020b the use of recycled wastewater in the irrigation of agricultural areas in arid and semi arid regions has gradually increased pedrero et al 2010 wastewater is important not only as an alternative water resource to freshwater but also as a valuable nutrient resource elgallal et al 2016 many researchers have stated that irrigation with recycled wastewater increases the macro and micro element contents in plants and soil kiziloglu et al 2007 2008 manas et al 2009 khurana and singh 2012 shilpi et al 2018 mousavi and shahsavari 2014 and alkhamisi et al 2017 also indicated that yield and growth characteristics in wastewater irrigated maize has improved with increased soil fertility water productivity in irrigated agriculture can be increased with deficit irrigation practices and irrigation methods with water saving technology water productivity and the yield response factor ky to water stress are commonly used indicators to evaluate the efficiency in deficit irrigation and to optimize management decisions under water shortage water productivity evaluates the yield against unit water whereas ky is used to assess linear relationships between evapotranspiration and yield deficits gheysari et al 2017 subsurface drip irrigation is one of the most effective practices in management scarce water resources because it increases water productivity by minimizing water consumption and increasing yields çetin and üzen 2018 ma et al 2020 in this method evaporation and runoff from soil surface deep percolation nutrient and chemical leaching and weed infestation are considerably reduced or eliminated and precipitation storage in drier soil is increased lamm 2002 many researchers also reported that subsurface drip irrigation with wastewater compared to surface drip and furrow irrigation resulted in higher growth and water productivity in maize asgari et al 2007 amiri et al 2009 hassanli et al 2009 maize shows different physiological responses to water deficiency due to quite sensitive to water stress improvement of water productivity is still ono of the priority issues of irrigated agriculture and requires better determination of yield responses to optimize production in water scarce conditions in different climates we hypothesized that silage maize irrigated with recycled wastewater in a subsurface drip method as compared to surface drip and furrow irrigation methods can provide higher yield and water productivity with lower water use in this study we also considered that determining the relationship between silage maize biomass and maize physiology with a subsurface drip irrigation method is different from previous studies due to higher yield response therefore this study was aimed to determine the effects of recycled wastewater applications in comparison to freshwater with different irrigation methods and irrigation levels on yield water productivity and physiological traits of silage maize in a semiarid region at a high altitude and to set yield response 2 material and methods 2 1 location climate and soil properties the field experiment was carried out during the growing periods of 2015 and 2016 between june and september at the agricultural research and application station of van yüzüncü yıl university in van turkey 38 576 n 43 29 e and the altitude of 1680 m the research area with an annual precipitation of 393 8 mm and an annual mean air temperature of 9 5 c during the 1981 2010 period has a semi arid climate dmi 2020 monthly total evaporation and precipitation values and mean air temperatures during the growing periods taken from the meteorological station established in the study area are also given in fig 1 the soil of the research area was classified as sandy clayey loam usda classification available water holding capacity of the soil was 154 5 mm on average in a 0 90 cm soil layer the ph electrical conductivity total n p2o5 k2o caco3 and organic matter content values in a surface soil layer of 30 cm were 8 08 0 217 ds m 1 0 078 24 08 mg kg 1 209 7 mg kg 1 11 2 and 1 06 respectively çakmakcı and şahin 2020 2 2 experimental design and irrigation applications the experimental field was separately arranged for three irrigation methods as subsurface drip irrigation ssdi surface drip irrigation sdi and furrow irrigation fi each irrigation method was planned by considering two water types fw freshwater and rw recycled municipal wastewater and three irrigation levels l100 full irrigation or non deficit irrigation l67 33 deficit irrigation and l33 67 deficit irrigation therefore the experiment was carried out as factorial based on completely randomized design with three replications suppl 1 three rainfed plots were also arranged in the experiment field since fresh biomass yield in rainfed conditions is a parameter required to calculate the yield response factor and iwp water productivity for amount of irrigation water applied properly the real time reference evapotranspiration eto approach was used to schedule irrigation daily eto values were calculated according to the fao 56 penman monteith method with cropwat 8 0 software allen et al 1998 daily weather data were collected from weather station metos tr in the experimental area when the total of daily reference eto values was 50 5 mm current soil moisture contents in plots with fully irrigated fw for each irrigation method were measured by gravimetric method and the differences between field capacity and current moisture were applied for the irrigation quantities the irrigation volumes calculated by eq 2 were applied to plots of l100 level in each method by measuring with water meters while the plots of l67 and l33 levels were irrigated with 33 and 67 less amounts of water respectively 1 i fc cm γ s d w 10 2 v i a where i is the irrigation water depth mm fc is the soil moisture content retained at field capacity pw cm is the current soil moisture pw γs is the soil bulk density g cm 3 d is the effective rooting depth cm w is the wetted percentage area 0 50 in ssdi 0 65 in sdi and 1 0 in furrow irrigation v is the irrigation volume liter and a is the plot area m2 the effective rooting depth was considered as 30 cm in the first two irrigations due to shallow root development and 90 cm in all subsequent irrigations each plot consisting of an area of 24 5 m2 with 3 5 m width 7 m length with five plant rows at 0 70 m intervals soil moisture contents were measured at a horizontal distance of approximately 15 20 cm from the dripper in between two plants on the plant row for the sdi and ssdi methods while it was measured at the middle point between two plant rows in the fi method each 30 cm soil layer up to a soil depth of 90 cm were separately sampled as three sub samples and averaged soil moisture contents were measured in the middle blocks of all treatments before each irrigation at planting and harvest and used to calculate actual evapotranspiration eta values also the furrows were established when maize plants achieve an approximate height of 50 cm from the soil surface the total amount of irrigation applied equally to all plots during the initial growing period from planting to furrow preparation was 92 7 mm in the first year and 55 0 mm in the second year subsequent irrigation events were carried out by applying different levels of fw and rw with three irrigation methods until the end of the growing period seasonal irrigation quantities applied at different irrigation levels with different irrigation methods are shown in fig 2 2 3 irrigation systems and cultural practices non pressure compensating emitters with a flow rate of 2 3 l h 1 in an operation pressure 0 1 mpa and a distance of 33 cm were used for both sdi and ssdi systems polyethylene driplines with 16 mm external diameter were established for each row at 70 cm intervals driplines were placed at a depth of approximately 25 cm for the ssdi system lamm and trooien 2005 a furrow about 20 25 cm deep was opened for each row for the fi method and the ends were closed irrigation water can be applied equally to the furrows since the furrows were established non slope and the furrow ends were closed the plots were tilled with the conventional tillage practice mouldboard plough rotary tiller leveler hybrid maize seeds ossk 644 in fao 650 group considering plant density 95 238 per hectare were sowed with a spacing of 15 cm between plants and 70 cm between rows on june 18 in the first year and on june 3 in the second year the harvests were carried out on september 30 in the first year and on september 26 in the second year inorganic fertilizing was applied to all plots in the first year while the wastewater plots were not fertilized in the second year considering the initial soil nitrogen and phosphorus contents to supplement the missing amounts urea 45 46 n and triple super phosphate 43 46 p2o5 fertilizers according to experimental region applications were applied in doses of 90 kg ha 1 and 150 kg ha 1 respectively when the plants reached an approximate height of 30 40 cm the first hoeing was carried out for weed disposal and 45 kg of urea 45 46 n per hectare was applied as the second fertilizing application a third application of urea was applied at a rate of 45 kg per hectare when plant heights reached approximately 50 cm no pesticide or herbicide was applied during the trial periods as there was no disease or insect effect 2 4 irrigation water properties the rw was obtained from the van i̇skele wastewater treatment plant which is approximately 5 km away from the experimental area the fw was taken from the irrigation pool of van yüzüncü yıl university irrigation water samples were collected four times in the irrigation season during both years in the middle of june july august and september the quality properties of the irrigation waters considering the mean of all samples are shown in table 1 çakmakcı and şahin 2020 all quality properties for the used waters were within usable limits for soil crop and irrigation systems ayers and westcot 1989 epa 2004 anonymous 2010 kanber and ünlü 2010 2 5 actual evapotranspiration actual evapotranspiration eta was calculated by using the method below suggested by allen et al 1998 3 eta i p cr dw rf δ s where eta is the actual evapotranspiration mm i is the amount of irrigation water applied mm p is the precipitation mm cr is the capillary rise mm dw is deep percolation mm rf is the amount of runoff mm and δs is the change in the soil layer at 0 90 cm mm the precipitation was measured with a pluviometer located in the experimental area there was no runoff loss since emitter flow was selected according to the soil infiltration characteristics in the surface drip irrigation method and the furrow ends were closed in furrow irrigation soil moisture above field capacity from the precipitation or irrigation events was considered deep percolation since the amount of irrigation applied did not exceed field capacity in all treatments deep percolation was by passed the deep percolation from the precipitation also was not determined except the l100 level in the fi method in 2015 year capillary rise was not considered due to the very deep water table in the region 20 m 2 6 water productivity irrigation water productivity and yield response factor water productivity for crop water consumption and water productivity for amount of irrigation water applied were calculated as follows howell 2001 çetin and kara 2019 4 wp yi eta 5 iwp yi y 0 i where wp is the water productivity for crop water consumption kg m 3 iwp is the water productivity for amount of irrigation water applied kg m 3 yi is the fresh biomass yield in irrigated plots kg ha 1 y0

maximum evapotranspiration mm the values for ya and eta were obtained from the rainfed and limited irrigation treatments djaman et al 2013 2 7 yield and physiological trait measurements at harvesting date ten randomly selected maize plants from harvesting area of 3 middle rows in each plot were cut from the ground level weighed and fresh biomass yields per unit area were determined the harvested fresh plants were weighed air dried and then oven dried at 78 c for at least 48 h to determine the dry matter ratio the oven dry weight was divided by the fresh weight to determine the dry matter ratio and this value was multiplied by the fresh biomass yield to determine dry biomass yield kacar 2014 leaf relative chlorophyll content lrcc was measured as spad unit using a portable chlorophyll meter device soil plant analysis development minolta spad 502 model ten readings from the fully expanded leaves in the middle part of three plants per experimental plot between 10 00 and 14 00 h at harvesting date were taken uğurlu 2017 leaf area was measured using a leaf area meter licor li 3000c model all the leaves of three plants in each plot were measured at harvesting date and the average leaf area per plant was divided to the unit area of each plant to determine leaf area index lai stewart and dwyer 1999 the leaf relative water content lrwc was determined from three leaf samples from each plot at harvesting date by using the following equation benešová et al 2012 7 lrwc sfw dw tw dw 100 where lrwc is the leaf relative water content sfw is the simple fresh weight of the leaf sample g dw is the leaf sample dry weight g tw is the turgid weight g sfw is the mass of the leaf sample immediately after cutting tw is the mass of the leaf sample saturated in distilled water for 4 h and dw is the mass of the leaf sample after drying at 65 c for 48 h leaf membrane damage was estimated through electrolyte leakage disc samples in a 10 mm diameter from the leaves of three plants were collected from each plot at harvesting date to determine electrolyte leakage el the samples were placed in test tubes of 50 ml and incubated with 30 ml distilled water at room temperature for 24 h after manually shaking the test tubes the electrical conductivity ec1 of the electrolyte was measured with a conductivity meter the samples were then incubated in a water bath at 95 c for 20 min to release all electrolytes cooled down to room temperature and their ec ec2 values were measured again el was calculated by using the following equation jamei et al 2009 hniličková et al 2019 8 el ec 1 ec 2 x 100 2 8 data analysis all data were subjected to analysis of variance using the general linear model in spss ver 21 to determine the significance of factors and their respective interactions csrac 2018 the independent sample t test was used to test whether there was a significant difference between the two year data significant differences were not found between the years for fresh and dry biomass yields water productivity and physiological traits therefore two years data pooling was used in analysis of variance when statistically significant mean comparisons between treatments were conducted using the duncan multiple comparison test the classifications in the variance analysis tables were made considering the triple interaction significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil moisture content and actual evapotranspiration the changes in soil moisture contents before irrigation events during the two growing periods are given in fig 3 soil moisture contents in the ssdi and sdi methods displayed similar trends under each irrigation level from the beginning until the end of the growing season while lesser moisture content values were observed in the fi method the ssdi method required 20 7 and 49 0 less irrigation water than the sdi and fi methods under fully irrigated conditions considering two year averages fig 2 therefore it was concluded that the ssdi method was the most effective practice in terms of soil moisture conservation probably due to decreased evaporation losses van donk et al 2012 ma et al 2020 the actual evapotranspiration eta values in the ssdi were lower than for the other methods while the deficit irrigation treatments decreased eta values also fig 4 however eta values for different water types in all irrigation methods were similar due to the same amounts of applied irrigation irrigation water was the most important component of eta therefore eta values in all treatments changed in parallel with the increase or decrease of irrigation quantities figs 2 and 4 similarly djaman et al 2018 reported that maize seasonal evapotranspiration displayed a linear correlation with the seasonal irrigation amount under high irrigation conditions eta values in different irrigation levels under the ssdi method varied between 297 9 and 389 7 mm in 2015 and 222 4 and 339 6 mm in 2016 fig 4 the ssdi method reduced eta by 18 5 and 45 6 in the l100 irrigation level 15 2 and 38 9 in the l67 level and 11 6 and 32 6 in the l33 level compared to the sdi and fi methods respectively these results indicate that the performance on eta saving of the ssdi was considerable in deficit irrigation conditions as well our findings indicate more savings than reported by evett et al 2005 who indicated that the ssdi method saved almost 10 of water use compared to the sdi method however several recent studies have noted savings in water consumption for maize which close to ours or even a little more compared with the furrow irrigation water savings of 33 3 60 0 and 33 4 60 0 in maize cultivation were found under drip irrigation in two growing periods respectively rasool et al 2020 maize irrigated with subsurface drip method consumed a lesser amount of water by 55 57 compared with the furrow method thamer et al 2021 maize crop evapotranspiration etc was affected by the irrigation systems with the surface and subsurface drip irrigation achieving a 25 and 39 reduction of seasonal etc in comparison with the solid set sprinkler system respectively valentín et al 2020 3 2 fresh and dry biomass yields silage maize fresh and dry biomass yields were significantly affected by irrigation methods water types and irrigation levels table 2 considering the two year averages fresh biomass yields 53 44 t ha 1 in the ssdi method was 3 4 and 10 0 higher than those in sdi and fi methods respectively fig 5 fresh biomass yield in the rw treatment was 4 9 higher than the value of 50 t ha 1 in the fw treatment fresh biomass yields in the l67 and l33 irrigation levels were 20 1 and 63 4 lower than the value of 70 98 t ha 1 in the l100 level respectively fig 5 considering statistically significant triple treatment effects the highest fresh biomass yield was determined in the ssdi rw l100 combination as 77 55 t ha 1 and it was 5 and 12 9 higher than in the sdi rw l100 and fi rw l100 combinations respectively table 2 under the rainfed conditions also fresh biomass yields of 12 73 t ha 1 in 2015 and 12 15 t ha 1 in 2016 were obtained the fresh biomass dry biomass yield relationship displayed strong positive linear relationships r2 0 994 for ssdi rw r2 0 996 for ssdi fw r2 0 993 for sdi rw r2 0 996 for sdi fw r2 0 997 for fi rw r2 0 993 for fi fw for both water types with all irrigation methods fresh and dry biomass yields in silage maize irrigated with different levels of both rw and fw treatments can be ordered from the higher to the lower as ssdi sdi fi table 2 the relationships between fresh biomass yield with seasonal evapotranspiration and irrigation quantity were also analyzed and the relationships with close linear correlations were found in all irrigation methods table 3 silage maize irrigated with the ssdi method incurred considerable increases in fresh and dry biomass yields at full and moderate irrigation levels without a decrease in soil moisture content as can be seen from fig 3 when compared with other methods however there was no increase in l33 level due to less water up taken by the plants from reduced wetting volume in root zone it can be argued that the yield increases at full and moderate irrigation levels can be caused by the following factors greater irrigation water use from a possible wetter root zone with the reduction of evaporation losses in the ssdi method umair et al 2019 the emergence of more favorable conditions that use moisture effectively as well as nutrients in a limited wetting zone badr et al 2010 the use of water saved from evaporation more beneficially evett et al 2005 the reduction of fluctuations in soil water content and providing good aeration to the plant root zone rodríguez sinobas and gil rodríguez 2012 the high nutritive value of wastewater had a positive impact on plant yield values table 1 such responses for wastewater irrigation have also been reported by khurana and singh 2012 mousavi and shahsavari 2014 becerra castro et al 2015 and chaganti et al 2020 who indicated that the nutritive potential of wastewater is an inductive factor in increasing crop production fresh biomass and dry biomass yields with the fw treatment were higher than the yields with the rw treatments with the ssdi and fi methods under the lowest irrigation conditions while the sdi method resulted in higher yields with the rw treatment table 2 yield deficiencies in lower soil moisture conditions with the rw treatment with the ssdi and fi methods can probably be explained with the partial increase in osmotic potential resulting from the higher salinity of wastewater compared to freshwater gloaguen et al 2010 stated that a shift in pore distribution from large to fine incurs under irrigation with recycled domestic wastewater which reduces the capacity to drain salts whereas salt movement from the wetting zone to the dry region out of the root zone can be observed with the sdi method as a result of evaporation from the soil surface li et al 2018 3 3 relationship between water use and yield anova analysis results of wp and iwp calculated from maize fresh biomass yields show that the values were significantly improved by irrigation methods water types and irrigation levels table 2 since irrigation water is a dominant component of evapotranspiration inputs in all irrigation methods a strong linear relationship r2 0 991 between wp and iwp values was found fig 6 the significant linear relationships between wp and iwp were also determined in two water types under all irrigation methods table 3 these results are compatible with the finding reported by djaman et al 2018 who found that cwue value in maize cwue is the ratio of yield to the sum of irrigation and precipitation increased linearly with maize iwp with a coefficient of determination of 0 99 the ssdi method resulted in the highest wp and iwp values and these values showed a significant reduction in the sdi method and the significant decreasing trend continued with the fi method fig 5 the wp value 16 79 kg m 3 in the ssdi method were 22 5 and 81 3 higher than those for the sdi and fi methods respectively similarly the iwp value 17 22 kg m 3 in the ssdi method were found to be 28 4 and 109 2 higher than in the sdi and fi methods respectively and these results about iwp confirmed that the ssdi method uses irrigation water more effectively in agreement with our findings hassanli et al 2009 reported that the iwp for maize was affected significantly by irrigation methods ssdi sdi fi and that the highest iwp was obtained in plots irrigated with the ssdi method requiring less irrigation water rw treatment also increased the wp by 4 6 and the iwp by 5 compared to the fw fig 5 higher fresh biomass yields in the rw treatments provided higher wp and iwp values alkhamisi et al 2011 also reported that irrigation with recycled wastewater increased the yield of forage maize and thus water productivity furthermore kiziloglu et al 2009 stated that higher wp values are due to increased silage maize yields the changes in wp and iwp were observed at different irrigation levels and the highest wp values were found in the l100 level table 2 considering all treatment combinations wp and iwp values in the ssdi method full irrigated with rw were 28 2 and 33 7 higher than for the sdi rw l100 combination values respectively and also 99 4 and 127 3 higher than for the fi rw l100 values table 2 increase ratios for wp and iwp in the l67 level with the ssdi method irrigated with rw were 19 8 and 25 7 compared with sdi rw l67 and 86 8 and 119 5 with fi rw l67 however the highest wp and iwp values in the lowest irrigation level were determined in fw conditions under the ssdi and fi methods in direct response to the changes in fresh biomass yield table 2 binary relationships between wp fresh biomass yield wp evapotranspiration iwp fresh biomass yield and iwp irrigation quantity in both water types under all irrigation methods were linear significantly as shown in table 3 therefore it can be said that the wp and iwp values were similarly affected by both irrigation levels or evapotranspiration and fresh biomass yield increase in summary yield increased with irrigation and improved wp and iwp with increasing yield and especially the yield response was found higher with the ssdi method similarly jha et al 2016 also stated that drip irrigation enhanced fodder yields and especially wp by minimizing evaporation losses from irrigation water during dry seasons compared to furrow systems moreover the findings in many studies showing the effects of deficit irrigation in maize crops grown in different regions of the world on wp or iwp paralleled the findings in this study kiziloglu et al 2009 naghashzadeh et al 2015 and ucak et al 2016 indicated that wp values in silage maize reduced with the decrease of irrigation while ors et al 2015 reported that the lowest iwp values in silage maize were observed under the lowest irrigation conditions similarly farré and faci 2006 determined lower wp values in maize with decreased evapotranspiration 3 4 yield response factor ky the slope of the ﬁtted regressions in fig 7 represent the seasonal yield response factor ky calculated from the two year data the ky values in rw and fw treatments were 1 77 and 1 70 in the ssdi method respectively 1 47 and 1 43 in the sdi method and 1 23 and 1 19 in the fi method these results show that higher ky values were determined in the rw treatments compared to the fw treatments and also that the ky values in both the rw and fw treatments were higher in the ssdi method than in the sdi and the fi methods it can be seen that these findings are strongly related to the changes in the fresh biomass yield due to the irrigation methods under different irrigation levels and water types the water stress in the l33 level was severe enough to decrease the biomass yield higher than the relative evapotranspiration deficits in all methods djaman et al 2013 also reported that when ky 1 the decrease in yield is proportionally greater with the decrease in water deficit this implies that the relative reduction rate in yield due to water stress is proportionally higher than in the relative reduction rate in evapotranspiration therefore higher fresh biomass yields under full irrigated conditions with the rw in ssdi methods resulted in higher ky values with the same approach it can be argued that the lower fresh biomass yields in the sdi method and subsequently the fi method compared to the ssdi method under full irrigation conditions caused lower ky values the ky values in this study can be valuable for practical uses in semi arid regions with a high altitude because previous studies demonstrate that ky values for different irrigation methods showed major differences according to the changes of climatic conditions from region to region kiziloglu et al 2009 had previously determined that the average ky value for silage maize irrigated with a hose drawn traveling sprinkler in the same experimental region was 1 51 our ky findings for sdi method are higher than those of 0 75 and 0 79 for sdi irrigation for two silage maize types under mediterranean climatic conditions dağdelen et al 2009 and those of 0 74 and 1 06 for sdi irrigated silage maize under hot and dry terrestrial climatic conditions ucak et al 2016 ghamarnia et al 2013 also determined a lower ky value 0 80 for sdi irrigated maize in a semi arid region furthermore as a lower value ertek and kara 2013 determined 0 59 and 0 99 ky values for sdi irrigated sweet maize at an altitude of 1050 m in a semi arid climate however kaman and kırda 2017 reported both lower ky values of 1 13 and higher ky values of 1 78 for maize with the sdi method in the mediterranean climate zone depending on the water deficit in a furrow irrigation study in agreement with our ky values for furrow method the ky value for maize changed from 0 81 to 1 36 under rainy and dry years respectively çakir 2004 3 5 relationship between yield and physiological traits the findings for physiological traits showed that the ssdi method resulted in the highest lrcc lai and lrwc values in the two year averages while the el value was the lowest table 4 rw significantly increased the lrcc lai lrwc and el values compared those with the fw treatment the lrcc lai and lrwc values in full irrigation were significantly higher than the l67 and l33 levels while higher el values were determined in the l33 level fig 8 higher lrcc values in rw treatments can be attributed to the fact that wastewater enhances the biosynthesis rate of chlorophyll abdel latef and sallam 2015 maize as a c4 crop has greater photosynthetic activity and can metabolize the high levels of nitrogen from recycled wastewater alkhamisi et al 2011 therefore higher silage maize yields in the wastewater irrigation conditions in this study are supported with lrcc increases the high presence of nitrogen in the recycled wastewater table 1 could be the reason for higher lai in rw applications lai and thereby the efficiency of photosynthesis increased in parallel with increasing nutrients in the soil with wastewater application mousavi et al 2013 the negative effect of rw on el was found to be statistically significant probably due to the higher salinity level in rw compared to fw table 1 yakıt and tuna 2006 reported that salt stress in maize increases membrane permeability and decreases relative water content significant positive linear correlations between lrcc and evapotranspiration given in table 5 clearly show the lrcc change trends with irrigation levels in both water types in all irrigation methods furthermore lrcc values rising with the increase of the evapotranspiration showed strong positive linear correlations with fresh biomass yields table 5 lrcc values linearly changed with the lai lrwc and el values in both water types in all irrigation methods table 5 the decrease in chlorophyll content is connected with membrane damage in mesophyll cells marcińska et al 2013 therefore strong negative correlative relationships were found between el values and fresh biomass yields in all irrigation methods table 5 furthermore lai lrwc and el values changed linearly with evapotranspiration table 5 these results are strongly supported by the effect of water deficit on declines in lai and lrwc and rising in el in addition el increasing under limited irrigation conditions is an expected result since water stress leads to increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species that causes damage to the cell membrane structure by injuring cell components naghashzadeh 2014 three factor interactions including the irrigation method water type and irrigation level were also significant for lrcc lrwc and el table 4 the ssdi method had lower el values compared to sdi and fi in full and deficit irrigation conditions table 4 this especially indicates that under water stress conditions the ssdi method reflects a higher resistance to drought the reduction in lai seems to be a mechanism related to drought tolerance therefore higher lai and lrwc values in ssdi compared to the sdi and fi methods is also an indicator that supports the finding of lower el values table 4 4 conclusions the findings in this study show that rw irrigation with the ssdi method provided the highest maize fresh and dry biomass yields in both full and moderate deficit irrigation conditions lower evapotranspiration irrigation quantities and higher fresh biomass yields in the ssdi improved wp and iwp values significantly increased yield and decreased water requirement in ssdi method can be evaluated as valuable findings in terms of environmental protection and sustainable agricultural production compared to the sdi and fi methods therefore it can be concluded that ssdi method can be a more feasible method for full and moderate deficit irrigated silage maize with rw in semi arid regions at a high altitude however although rw has high nutritional values potentially compared to fw rw irrigation could add some salts and heavy metals into the soil and also appear the clogging problems in emitters in drip systems therefore a monitoring preventing practice can be required to prevent long term negative effects likely conducting new studies on the management of soil moisture

10016,the contribution of wastewater irrigation with the improvement of irrigation practices to the productivity of silage maize is a priority issue to investigate considering the saving of scarce freshwater resources and the necessity to dispose wastewater the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different irrigation levels l100 l67 and l33 of recycled municipal wastewater rw compared to freshwater fw using subsurface drip ssdi surface drip sdi and furrow irrigation fi methods on yield and some physiological traits of silage maize in semi arid conditions at a high altitude when the total daily reference evapotranspiration value reached 50 5 mm irrigation quantities corresponding to 100 67 and 33 of soil moisture deficit based on field capacity in fully irrigated plots with freshwater were applied in different irrigation levels crop actual evapotranspiration eta values were found close in both water types ssdi reduced eta by 18 5 and 45 6 in l100 level 15 2 and 38 9 in l67 and 11 6 and 32 6 in l33 respectively compared to sdi and fi the highest fresh biomass yield was determined in the ssdi rw l100 combination as 77 55 t ha 1 and resulted in 5 and 12 9 higher values than in sdi and fi leaf relative chlorophyll and water contents leaf area index and electrolyte leakage showed strong linear correlations with yield and evapotranspiration values the highest water productivity was determined in the ssdi rw l100 combination as 21 48 kg m 3 and it was higher by 28 2 and 99 4 than those in sdi and fi respectively improvement of productivity with increased irrigation quantities in ssdi delivered the high yield response factor of 1 70 1 77 therefore it is concluded that the ssdi method can be a successful practice to improve productivity by alleviating the need for water for silage maize especially under full irrigation with rw keywords deficit irrigation drip furrow physiological traits recycled wastewater yield response factor 1 introduction silage maize is one of the most important fodder crops due to its high nutritive value as well as its extensive adaptability to varied agro climatic conditions chaudhary et al 2014 maize world production was 1 148 billion tonnes in an area of 193 7 million ha in 2018 and the average production was 5 926 7 kg ha 1 fao 2020 in turkey silage maize production area total production and average fresh biomass yield was 0 461 million ha 23 2 million tonnes and 50 325 kg ha 1 for the same year respectively tsi 2020a drought significantly reduces yield and the quality of silage maize nilahyane et al 2020 freshwater resources are limited in many arid and semi arid regions in turkey growers are looking for more water saving irrigation practices and alternative water resources due to increasing concerns about the sustainable use of limited fresh water resources in the country the amount of recycled wastewater discharges from the wastewater treatment plants in turkey was 4 24 billion m3 in 2018 tsi 2020b the use of recycled wastewater in the irrigation of agricultural areas in arid and semi arid regions has gradually increased pedrero et al 2010 wastewater is important not only as an alternative water resource to freshwater but also as a valuable nutrient resource elgallal et al 2016 many researchers have stated that irrigation with recycled wastewater increases the macro and micro element contents in plants and soil kiziloglu et al 2007 2008 manas et al 2009 khurana and singh 2012 shilpi et al 2018 mousavi and shahsavari 2014 and alkhamisi et al 2017 also indicated that yield and growth characteristics in wastewater irrigated maize has improved with increased soil fertility water productivity in irrigated agriculture can be increased with deficit irrigation practices and irrigation methods with water saving technology water productivity and the yield response factor ky to water stress are commonly used indicators to evaluate the efficiency in deficit irrigation and to optimize management decisions under water shortage water productivity evaluates the yield against unit water whereas ky is used to assess linear relationships between evapotranspiration and yield deficits gheysari et al 2017 subsurface drip irrigation is one of the most effective practices in management scarce water resources because it increases water productivity by minimizing water consumption and increasing yields çetin and üzen 2018 ma et al 2020 in this method evaporation and runoff from soil surface deep percolation nutrient and chemical leaching and weed infestation are considerably reduced or eliminated and precipitation storage in drier soil is increased lamm 2002 many researchers also reported that subsurface drip irrigation with wastewater compared to surface drip and furrow irrigation resulted in higher growth and water productivity in maize asgari et al 2007 amiri et al 2009 hassanli et al 2009 maize shows different physiological responses to water deficiency due to quite sensitive to water stress improvement of water productivity is still ono of the priority issues of irrigated agriculture and requires better determination of yield responses to optimize production in water scarce conditions in different climates we hypothesized that silage maize irrigated with recycled wastewater in a subsurface drip method as compared to surface drip and furrow irrigation methods can provide higher yield and water productivity with lower water use in this study we also considered that determining the relationship between silage maize biomass and maize physiology with a subsurface drip irrigation method is different from previous studies due to higher yield response therefore this study was aimed to determine the effects of recycled wastewater applications in comparison to freshwater with different irrigation methods and irrigation levels on yield water productivity and physiological traits of silage maize in a semiarid region at a high altitude and to set yield response 2 material and methods 2 1 location climate and soil properties the field experiment was carried out during the growing periods of 2015 and 2016 between june and september at the agricultural research and application station of van yüzüncü yıl university in van turkey 38 576 n 43 29 e and the altitude of 1680 m the research area with an annual precipitation of 393 8 mm and an annual mean air temperature of 9 5 c during the 1981 2010 period has a semi arid climate dmi 2020 monthly total evaporation and precipitation values and mean air temperatures during the growing periods taken from the meteorological station established in the study area are also given in fig 1 the soil of the research area was classified as sandy clayey loam usda classification available water holding capacity of the soil was 154 5 mm on average in a 0 90 cm soil layer the ph electrical conductivity total n p2o5 k2o caco3 and organic matter content values in a surface soil layer of 30 cm were 8 08 0 217 ds m 1 0 078 24 08 mg kg 1 209 7 mg kg 1 11 2 and 1 06 respectively çakmakcı and şahin 2020 2 2 experimental design and irrigation applications the experimental field was separately arranged for three irrigation methods as subsurface drip irrigation ssdi surface drip irrigation sdi and furrow irrigation fi each irrigation method was planned by considering two water types fw freshwater and rw recycled municipal wastewater and three irrigation levels l100 full irrigation or non deficit irrigation l67 33 deficit irrigation and l33 67 deficit irrigation therefore the experiment was carried out as factorial based on completely randomized design with three replications suppl 1 three rainfed plots were also arranged in the experiment field since fresh biomass yield in rainfed conditions is a parameter required to calculate the yield response factor and iwp water productivity for amount of irrigation water applied properly the real time reference evapotranspiration eto approach was used to schedule irrigation daily eto values were calculated according to the fao 56 penman monteith method with cropwat 8 0 software allen et al 1998 daily weather data were collected from weather station metos tr in the experimental area when the total of daily reference eto values was 50 5 mm current soil moisture contents in plots with fully irrigated fw for each irrigation method were measured by gravimetric method and the differences between field capacity and current moisture were applied for the irrigation quantities the irrigation volumes calculated by eq 2 were applied to plots of l100 level in each method by measuring with water meters while the plots of l67 and l33 levels were irrigated with 33 and 67 less amounts of water respectively 1 i fc cm γ s d w 10 2 v i a where i is the irrigation water depth mm fc is the soil moisture content retained at field capacity pw cm is the current soil moisture pw γs is the soil bulk

effective rooting depth was considered as 30 cm in the first two irrigations due to shallow root development and 90 cm in all subsequent irrigations each plot consisting of an area of 24 5 m2 with 3 5 m width 7 m length with five plant rows at 0 70 m intervals soil moisture contents were measured at a horizontal distance of approximately 15 20 cm from the dripper in between two plants on the plant row for the sdi and ssdi methods while it was measured at the middle point between two plant rows in the fi method each 30 cm soil layer up to a soil depth of 90 cm were separately sampled as three sub samples and averaged soil moisture contents were measured in the middle blocks of all treatments before each irrigation at planting and harvest and used to calculate actual evapotranspiration eta values also the furrows were established when maize plants achieve an approximate height of 50 cm from the soil surface the total amount of irrigation applied equally to all plots during the initial growing period from planting to furrow preparation was 92 7 mm in the first year and 55 0 mm in the second year subsequent irrigation events were carried out by applying different levels of fw and rw with three irrigation methods until the end of the growing period seasonal irrigation quantities applied at different irrigation levels with different irrigation methods are shown in fig 2 2 3 irrigation systems and cultural practices non pressure compensating emitters with a flow rate of 2 3 l h 1 in an operation pressure 0 1 mpa and a distance of 33 cm were used for both sdi and ssdi systems polyethylene driplines with 16 mm external diameter were established for each row at 70 cm intervals driplines were placed at a depth of approximately 25 cm for the ssdi system lamm and trooien 2005 a furrow about 20 25 cm deep was opened for each row for the fi method and the ends were closed irrigation water can be applied equally to the furrows since the furrows were established non slope and the furrow ends were closed the plots were tilled with the conventional tillage practice mouldboard plough rotary tiller leveler hybrid maize seeds ossk 644 in fao 650 group considering plant density 95 238 per hectare were sowed with a spacing of 15 cm between plants and 70 cm between rows on june 18 in the first year and on june 3 in the second year the harvests were carried out on september 30 in the first year and on september 26 in the second year inorganic fertilizing was applied to all plots in the first year while the wastewater plots were not fertilized in the second year considering the initial soil nitrogen and phosphorus contents to supplement the missing amounts urea 45 46 n and triple super phosphate 43 46 p2o5 fertilizers according to experimental region applications were applied in doses of 90 kg ha 1 and 150 kg ha 1 respectively when the plants reached an approximate height of 30 40 cm the first hoeing was carried out for weed disposal and 45 kg of urea 45 46 n per hectare was applied as the second fertilizing application a third application of urea was applied at a rate of 45 kg per hectare when plant heights reached approximately 50 cm no pesticide or herbicide was applied during the trial periods as there was no disease or insect effect 2 4 irrigation water properties the rw was obtained from the van i̇skele wastewater treatment plant which is approximately 5 km away from the experimental area the fw was taken from the irrigation pool of van yüzüncü yıl university irrigation water samples were collected four times in the irrigation season during both years in the middle of june july august and september the quality properties of the irrigation waters considering the mean of all samples are shown in table 1 çakmakcı and şahin 2020 all quality properties for the used waters were within usable limits for soil crop and irrigation systems ayers and westcot 1989 epa 2004 anonymous 2010 kanber and ünlü 2010 2 5 actual evapotranspiration actual evapotranspiration eta was calculated by using the method below suggested by allen et al 1998 3 eta i p cr dw rf δ s where eta is the actual evapotranspiration mm i is the amount of irrigation water applied mm p is the precipitation mm cr is the capillary rise mm dw is deep percolation mm rf is the amount of runoff mm and δs is the change in the soil layer at 0 90 cm mm the precipitation was measured with a pluviometer located in the experimental area there was no runoff loss since emitter flow was selected according to the soil infiltration characteristics in the surface drip irrigation method and the furrow ends were closed in furrow irrigation soil moisture above field capacity from the precipitation or irrigation events was considered deep percolation since the amount of irrigation applied did not exceed field capacity in all treatments deep percolation was by passed the deep percolation from the precipitation also was not determined except the l100 level in the fi method in 2015 year capillary rise was not considered due to the very deep water table in the region 20 m 2 6 water productivity irrigation water productivity and yield response factor water productivity for crop water consumption and water productivity for amount of irrigation water applied were calculated as follows howell 2001 çetin and kara 2019 4 wp yi eta 5 iwp yi y 0 i where wp is the water productivity for crop water consumption kg m 3 iwp is the water productivity for amount of irrigation water applied kg m 3 yi is the fresh biomass yield in irrigated plots kg ha 1 y0

determine the ky factor doorenbos and kassam 1979 6 1 ya ym ky 1 eta etm where ya is the actual yield t ha 1 ym is the maximum yield t ha 1 eta is the actual evapotranspiration mm and etm is the maximum evapotranspiration mm the values for ya and eta were obtained from the rainfed and limited irrigation treatments djaman et al 2013 2 7 yield and physiological trait measurements at harvesting date ten randomly selected maize plants from harvesting area of 3 middle rows in each plot were cut from the ground level weighed and fresh biomass yields per unit area were determined the harvested fresh plants were weighed air dried and then oven dried at 78 c for at least 48 h to determine the dry matter ratio the oven dry weight was divided by the fresh weight to determine the dry matter ratio and this value was multiplied by the fresh biomass yield to determine dry biomass yield kacar 2014 leaf relative chlorophyll content lrcc was measured as spad unit using a portable chlorophyll meter device soil plant analysis development minolta spad 502 model ten readings from the fully expanded leaves in the middle part of three plants per experimental plot between 10 00 and 14 00 h at harvesting date were taken uğurlu 2017 leaf area was measured using a leaf area meter licor li 3000c model all the leaves of three plants in each plot were measured at harvesting date and the average leaf area per plant was divided to the unit area of each plant to determine leaf area index lai stewart and dwyer 1999 the leaf relative water content lrwc was determined from three leaf samples from each plot at harvesting date by using the following equation benešová et al 2012 7 lrwc sfw dw tw dw 100 where lrwc is the leaf relative water content sfw is the simple fresh weight of the leaf sample g dw is the leaf sample dry weight g tw is the turgid weight g sfw is the mass of the leaf sample immediately after cutting tw is the mass of the leaf sample saturated in distilled water for 4 h and dw is the mass of the leaf sample after drying at 65 c for 48 h leaf membrane damage was estimated through electrolyte leakage disc samples in a 10 mm diameter from the leaves of three plants were collected from each plot at harvesting date to determine electrolyte leakage el the samples were placed in test tubes of 50 ml and incubated with 30 ml distilled water at room temperature for 24 h after manually shaking the test tubes the electrical conductivity ec1 of the electrolyte was measured with a conductivity meter the samples were then incubated in a water bath at 95 c for 20 min to release all electrolytes cooled down to room temperature and their ec ec2 values were measured again el was calculated by using the following equation jamei et al 2009 hniličková et al 2019 8 el ec 1 ec 2 x 100 2 8 data analysis all data were subjected to analysis of variance using the general linear model in spss ver 21 to determine the significance of factors and their respective interactions csrac 2018 the independent sample t test was used to test whether there was a significant difference between the two year data significant differences were not found between the years for fresh and dry biomass yields water productivity and physiological traits therefore two years data pooling was used in analysis of variance when statistically significant mean comparisons between treatments were conducted using the duncan multiple comparison test the classifications in the variance analysis tables were made considering the triple interaction significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil moisture content and actual evapotranspiration the changes in soil moisture contents before irrigation events during the two growing periods are given in fig 3 soil moisture contents in the ssdi and sdi methods displayed similar trends under each irrigation level from the beginning until the end of the growing season while lesser moisture content values were observed in the fi method the ssdi method required 20 7 and 49 0 less irrigation water than the sdi and fi methods under fully irrigated conditions considering two year averages fig 2 therefore it was concluded that the ssdi method was the most effective practice in terms of soil moisture conservation probably due to decreased evaporation losses van donk et al 2012 ma et al 2020 the actual evapotranspiration eta values in the ssdi were lower than for the other methods while the deficit irrigation treatments decreased eta values also fig 4 however eta values for different water types in all irrigation methods were similar due to the same amounts of applied irrigation irrigation water was the most important component of eta therefore eta values in all treatments changed in parallel with the increase or decrease of irrigation quantities figs 2 and 4 similarly djaman et al 2018 reported that maize seasonal evapotranspiration displayed a linear correlation with the seasonal irrigation amount under high irrigation conditions eta values in different irrigation levels under the ssdi method varied between 297 9 and 389 7 mm in 2015 and 222 4 and 339 6 mm in 2016 fig 4 the ssdi method reduced eta by 18 5 and 45 6 in the l100 irrigation level 15 2 and 38 9 in the l67 level and 11 6 and 32 6 in the l33 level compared to the sdi and fi methods respectively these results indicate that the performance on eta saving of the ssdi was considerable in deficit irrigation conditions as well our findings indicate more savings than reported by evett et al 2005 who indicated that the ssdi method saved almost 10 of water use compared to the sdi method however several recent studies have noted savings in water consumption for maize which close to ours or even a little more compared with the furrow irrigation water savings of 33 3 60 0 and 33 4 60 0 in maize cultivation were found under drip irrigation in two growing periods respectively rasool et al 2020 maize irrigated with subsurface drip method consumed a lesser amount of water by 55 57 compared with the furrow method thamer et al 2021 maize crop evapotranspiration etc was affected by the irrigation systems with the surface and subsurface drip irrigation achieving a 25 and 39 reduction of seasonal etc in comparison with the solid set sprinkler system respectively valentín et al 2020 3 2 fresh and dry biomass yields silage maize fresh and dry biomass yields were significantly affected by irrigation methods water types and irrigation levels table 2 considering the two year averages fresh biomass yields 53 44 t ha 1 in the ssdi method was 3 4 and 10 0 higher than those in sdi and fi methods respectively fig 5 fresh biomass yield in the rw treatment was 4 9 higher than the value of 50 t ha 1 in the fw treatment fresh biomass yields in the l67 and l33 irrigation levels were 20 1 and 63 4 lower than the value of 70 98 t ha 1 in the l100 level respectively fig 5 considering statistically significant triple treatment effects the highest fresh biomass yield was determined in the ssdi rw l100 combination as 77 55 t ha 1 and it was 5 and 12 9 higher than in the sdi rw l100 and fi rw l100 combinations respectively table 2 under the rainfed conditions also fresh biomass yields of 12 73 t ha 1 in 2015 and 12 15 t ha 1 in 2016 were obtained the fresh biomass dry biomass yield relationship displayed strong positive linear relationships r2 0 994 for ssdi rw r2 0 996 for ssdi fw r2 0 993 for sdi rw r2 0 996 for sdi fw r2 0 997 for fi rw r2 0 993 for fi fw for both water types with all irrigation methods fresh and dry biomass yields in silage maize irrigated with different levels of both rw and fw treatments can be ordered from the higher to the lower as ssdi sdi fi table 2 the relationships between fresh biomass yield with seasonal evapotranspiration and irrigation quantity were also analyzed and the relationships with close linear correlations were found in all irrigation methods table 3 silage maize irrigated with the ssdi method incurred considerable increases in fresh and dry biomass yields at full and moderate irrigation levels without a decrease in soil moisture content as can be seen from fig 3 when compared with other methods however there was no increase in l33 level due to less water up taken by the plants from reduced wetting volume in root zone it can be argued that the yield increases at full and moderate irrigation levels can be caused by the following factors greater irrigation water use from a possible wetter root zone with the reduction of evaporation losses in the ssdi method umair et al 2019 the emergence of more favorable conditions that use moisture effectively as well as nutrients in a limited wetting zone badr et al 2010 the use of water saved from evaporation more beneficially evett et al 2005 the reduction of fluctuations in soil water content and providing good aeration to the plant root zone rodríguez sinobas and gil rodríguez 2012 the high nutritive value of wastewater had a positive impact on plant yield values table 1 such responses for wastewater irrigation have also been reported by khurana and singh 2012 mousavi and shahsavari 2014 becerra castro et al 2015 and chaganti et al 2020 who indicated that the nutritive potential of wastewater is an inductive factor in increasing crop production fresh biomass and dry biomass yields with the fw treatment were higher than the yields with the rw treatments with the ssdi and fi methods under the lowest irrigation conditions while the sdi method resulted in higher yields with the rw treatment table 2 yield deficiencies in lower soil moisture conditions with the rw treatment with the ssdi and fi methods can probably be explained with the partial increase in osmotic potential resulting from the higher salinity of wastewater compared to freshwater gloaguen et al 2010 stated that a shift in pore distribution from large to fine incurs under irrigation with recycled domestic wastewater which reduces the capacity to drain salts whereas salt movement from the wetting zone to the dry region out of the root zone can be observed with the sdi method as a result of evaporation from the soil surface li et al 2018 3 3 relationship between water use and yield anova analysis results of wp and iwp calculated from maize fresh biomass yields show that the values were significantly improved by irrigation methods water types and irrigation levels table 2 since irrigation water is a dominant component of evapotranspiration inputs in all irrigation methods a strong linear relationship r2 0 991 between wp and iwp values was found fig 6 the significant linear relationships between wp and iwp were also determined in two water types under all irrigation methods table 3 these results are compatible with the finding reported by djaman et al 2018 who found that cwue value in maize cwue is the ratio of yield to the sum of irrigation and precipitation increased linearly with maize iwp with a coefficient of determination of 0 99 the ssdi method resulted in the highest wp and iwp values and these values showed a significant reduction in the sdi method and the significant decreasing trend continued with the fi method fig 5 the wp value 16 79 kg m 3 in the ssdi method were 22 5 and 81 3 higher than those for the sdi and fi methods respectively similarly the iwp value 17 22 kg m 3 in the ssdi method were found to be 28 4 and 109 2 higher than in the sdi and fi methods respectively and these results about iwp confirmed that the ssdi method uses irrigation water more effectively in agreement with our findings hassanli et al 2009 reported that the iwp for maize was affected significantly by irrigation methods ssdi sdi fi and that the highest iwp was obtained in plots irrigated with the ssdi method requiring less irrigation water rw treatment also increased the wp by 4 6 and the iwp by 5 compared to the fw fig 5 higher fresh biomass yields in the rw treatments provided higher wp and iwp values alkhamisi et al 2011 also reported that irrigation with recycled wastewater increased the yield of forage maize and thus water productivity furthermore kiziloglu et al 2009 stated that higher wp values are due to increased silage maize yields the changes in wp and iwp were observed at different irrigation levels and the highest wp values were found in the l100 level table 2 considering all treatment combinations wp and iwp values in the ssdi method full irrigated with rw were 28 2 and 33 7 higher than for the sdi rw l100 combination values respectively and also 99 4 and 127 3 higher than for the fi rw l100 values table 2 increase ratios for wp and iwp in the l67 level with the ssdi method irrigated with rw were 19 8 and 25 7 compared with sdi rw l67 and 86 8 and 119 5 with fi rw l67 however the highest wp and iwp values in the lowest irrigation level were determined in fw conditions under the ssdi and fi methods in direct response to the changes in fresh biomass yield table 2 binary relationships between wp fresh biomass yield wp evapotranspiration iwp fresh biomass yield and iwp irrigation quantity in both water types under all irrigation methods were linear significantly as shown in table 3 therefore it can be said that the wp and iwp values were similarly affected by both irrigation levels or evapotranspiration and fresh biomass yield increase in summary yield increased with irrigation and improved wp and iwp with increasing yield and especially the yield response was found higher with the ssdi method similarly jha et al 2016 also stated that drip irrigation enhanced fodder yields and especially wp by minimizing evaporation losses from irrigation water during dry seasons compared to furrow systems moreover the findings in many studies showing the effects of deficit irrigation in maize crops grown in different regions of the world on wp or iwp paralleled the findings in this study kiziloglu et al 2009 naghashzadeh et al 2015 and ucak et al 2016 indicated that wp values in silage maize reduced with the decrease of irrigation while ors et al 2015 reported that the lowest iwp values in silage maize were observed under the lowest irrigation conditions similarly farré and faci 2006 determined lower wp values in maize with decreased evapotranspiration 3 4 yield response factor ky the slope of the ﬁtted regressions in fig 7 represent the seasonal yield response factor ky calculated from the two year data the ky values in rw and fw treatments were 1 77 and 1 70 in the ssdi method respectively 1 47 and 1 43 in the sdi method and 1 23 and 1 19 in the fi method these results show that higher ky values were determined in the rw treatments compared to the fw treatments and also that the ky values in both the rw and fw treatments were higher in the ssdi method than in the sdi and the fi methods it can be seen that these findings are strongly related to the changes in the fresh biomass yield due to the irrigation methods under different irrigation levels and water types the water stress in the l33 level was severe enough to decrease the biomass yield higher than the relative evapotranspiration deficits in all methods djaman et al 2013 also reported that when ky 1 the decrease in yield is proportionally greater with the decrease in water deficit this implies that the relative reduction rate in yield due to water stress is proportionally higher than in the relative reduction rate in evapotranspiration therefore higher fresh biomass yields under full irrigated conditions with the rw in ssdi methods resulted in higher ky values with the same approach it can be argued that the lower fresh biomass yields in the sdi method and subsequently the fi method compared to the ssdi method under full irrigation conditions caused lower ky values the ky values in this study can be valuable for practical uses in semi arid regions with a high altitude because previous studies demonstrate that ky values for different irrigation methods showed major differences according to the changes of climatic conditions from region to region kiziloglu et al 2009 had previously determined that the average ky value for silage maize irrigated with a hose drawn traveling sprinkler in the same experimental region was 1 51 our ky findings for sdi method are higher than those of 0 75 and 0 79 for sdi irrigation for two silage maize types under mediterranean climatic conditions dağdelen et al 2009 and those of 0 74 and 1 06 for sdi irrigated silage maize under hot and dry terrestrial climatic conditions ucak et al 2016 ghamarnia et al 2013 also determined a lower ky value 0 80 for sdi irrigated maize in a semi arid region furthermore as a lower value ertek and kara 2013 determined 0 59 and 0 99 ky values for sdi irrigated sweet maize at an altitude of 1050 m in a semi arid climate however kaman and kırda 2017 reported both lower ky values of 1 13 and higher ky values of 1 78 for maize with the sdi method in the mediterranean climate zone depending on the water deficit in a furrow irrigation study in agreement with our ky values for furrow method the ky value for maize changed from 0 81 to 1 36 under rainy and dry years respectively çakir 2004 3 5 relationship between yield and physiological traits the findings for physiological traits showed that the ssdi method resulted in the highest lrcc lai and lrwc values in the two year averages while the el value was the lowest table 4 rw significantly increased the lrcc lai lrwc and el values compared those with the fw treatment the lrcc lai and lrwc values in full irrigation were significantly higher than the l67 and l33 levels while higher el values were determined in the l33 level fig 8 higher lrcc values in rw treatments can be attributed to the fact that wastewater enhances the biosynthesis rate of chlorophyll abdel latef and sallam 2015 maize as a c4 crop has greater photosynthetic activity and can metabolize the high levels of nitrogen from recycled wastewater alkhamisi et al 2011 therefore higher silage maize yields in the wastewater irrigation conditions in this study are supported with lrcc increases the high presence of nitrogen in the recycled wastewater table 1 could be the reason for higher lai in rw applications lai and thereby the efficiency of photosynthesis increased in parallel with increasing nutrients in the soil with wastewater application mousavi et al 2013 the negative effect of rw on el was found to be statistically significant probably due to the higher salinity level in rw compared to fw table 1 yakıt and tuna 2006 reported that salt stress in maize increases membrane permeability and decreases relative water content significant positive linear correlations between lrcc and evapotranspiration given in table 5 clearly show the lrcc change trends with irrigation levels in both water types in all irrigation methods furthermore lrcc values rising with the increase of the evapotranspiration showed strong positive linear correlations with fresh biomass yields table 5 lrcc values linearly changed with the lai lrwc and el values in both water types in all irrigation methods table 5 the decrease in chlorophyll content is connected with membrane damage in mesophyll cells marcińska et al 2013 therefore strong negative correlative relationships were found between el values and fresh biomass yields in all irrigation methods table 5 furthermore lai lrwc and el values changed linearly with evapotranspiration table 5 these results are strongly supported by the effect of water deficit on declines in lai and lrwc and rising in el in addition el increasing under limited irrigation conditions is an expected result since water stress leads to increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species that causes damage to the cell membrane structure by injuring cell components naghashzadeh 2014 three factor interactions including the irrigation method water type and irrigation level were also significant for lrcc lrwc and el table 4 the ssdi method had lower el values compared to sdi and fi in full and deficit irrigation conditions table 4 this especially indicates that under water stress conditions the ssdi method reflects a higher resistance to drought the reduction in lai seems to be a mechanism related to drought tolerance therefore higher lai and lrwc values in ssdi compared to the sdi and fi methods is also an indicator that supports the finding of lower el values table 4 4 conclusions the findings in this study show that rw irrigation with the ssdi method provided the highest maize fresh and dry biomass yields in both full and moderate deficit irrigation conditions lower evapotranspiration irrigation quantities and higher fresh biomass yields in the ssdi improved wp and iwp values significantly increased yield and decreased water requirement in ssdi method can be evaluated as valuable findings in terms of environmental protection and sustainable agricultural production compared to the sdi and fi methods therefore it can be concluded that ssdi method can be a more feasible method for full and moderate deficit irrigated silage maize with rw in semi arid regions at a high altitude however although rw has high nutritional values potentially compared to fw rw irrigation could add some salts and heavy metals into the soil and also appear the clogging problems in emitters in drip systems therefore a monitoring preventing practice can be required to prevent long term negative effects likely conducting new studies on the management of soil moisture regime in case of increasing salinity levels of wastewater will provide new benefits in increasing water productivity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

10017,tracing the main sources and spatial distributions of pollutants and quantifying the effects of various factors on soil erosion and pollution loads are important to allow appropriate management systems to be developed for large complex watersheds and allow water pollution to be controlled efficiently and economically a distributed water sediment and pollutant model was used to qualitatively and quantitatively assess temporal and spatial variations in water and sediment characteristics and nitrogen n and phosphorus p loss distributions in a basin from a macroscopic point of view and to trace the sources of pollutants using the jialing river basin as an example changes in n and p losses in the basin caused by various management practices were assessed the results indicated that the average annual water and sediment yield in the study area were 103 857 mm and 2 4 1274 1 t ha respectively the loss of total n and p were 1 1 21 6 kg ha and 0 01 11 2 kg ha the spatial distribution varied greatly but the annual variation trend was relatively stable the contribution of n from industrial point sources reached 1973 tons which was dominant and the total n distribution in the watershed was closely related to woodland total p pollution was most severe for cultivated land the p load caused by fertilization reached 805 tons which was significantly more than the point source discharge assessments of the effects of implementing various management practices in the watershed indicated that n losses would be decreased more effectively by filter belt in woodland than by other practices the total n loss would be reduced by 4 4 for every 0 5 m filter belt added to woodland the losses would be decreased more effectively by a cultivated land filter belt and controlling fertilizer application than by other practices the 0 5 m filter belt of cultivated land can reduce total p by 5 and reducing fertilization by 5 can reduce total p by 7 3 understanding the temporal and spatial distributions of pollutant sources in a river basin and tracing pollutant sources will allow appropriate management practices to be implemented in key areas to effectively control pollutants keywords nitrogen and phosphorus loss soil erosion management measures temporal and spatial distributions pollutants source tracing 1 introduction nitrogen n and phosphorus p which are essential elements for plant and animal growth and development are important components of the soil environment and vital to the ecological health of aquatic ecosystems excessive n and p loss not only causes pollution and eutrophication in aquatic environments but also adverse effects on aquatic life and decreases soil fertility and crop yields n and p losses are therefore important threats to water quality and agricultural development cui et al 2020 zhong et al 2020 zhu et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 mcisaac et al 2003 kim et al 2006 there is an urgent need for effective measures for controlling and decreasing n and p losses to be developed to allow sustainable development n and p in a river basin can be released into water at point sources and non point sources the main point sources are relatively easy to identify and treat wastewater and emissions of n and p in wastewater are well controlled in most countries while releases of n and p from non point sources are affected by many factors such as the topography climate soil land use vegetation cover precipitation and human activities srinivas et al 2020 shen et al 2008 complex and diverse release mechanisms make non point source pollution very variable widely distributed difficult to monitor and difficult to identify meaning it is difficult to treat water affected by non point source pollution zou et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 bryan et al 2011 dowd et al 2008 studies have shown that future precipitation changes caused by climate change alone will exacerbate water eutrophication in china india and southeast asia without intervention sinha et al 2017 many non point source pollution simulations have been performed including the simulation of temporal and spatial distributions of non point source pollution han et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 the study on the effects of watershed changes caused by human activities on hydrology and water quality keesstra et al 2018a shrestha et al 2018 wei et al 2018 rodrigo et al 2018 and the study on the effects of climate and other natural conditions on pollution loads in river basins yi et al 2020 zhou et al 2017 johnson et al 2015 glavan et al 2015 all of the studies mentioned above can be seen as attempts to identify the processes involved in non point source pollution caused by environmental changes and to assess the current pollution statuses of river basins many studies of methods for controlling non point source pollution caused by human activities have also been performed himanshu et al 2019 luo and wang 2019 hammad et al 2018 some studies of the economic costs and efficiencies of different management measures and ways of implementing policies to modify the management system have been performed liu et al 2020 schall et al 2018 haas et al 2017 the process based watershed model can simulate the movement of water and sediment as well as the transport and transformation of pollutants from different sources in the basin which can provide a reliable basis for non point source pollution mechanism research impact assessment and pollution control many process based watershed models have been applied to study watershed nutrient cycling including the hspf model ribarova et al 2008 the agnps model srivastava et al 2002 swrrb model esen et al 2008 and swat model zeiger et al 2021 etc in the past few decades the soil and water assessment tool swat model is a distributed hydrological model at the watershed scale that uses a day as its time unit the model can simulate hydrological processes and various pollution loads in complex basins with various land use modes soil types and management modes and predicts the long term effects of changes in climate management practices and other factors on water yield sediment yield and aquatic environment pollution in the basins borah et al 2003 gassman et al 2007 arnold et al 2005 however the characteristics of non point source pollution variability broad distribution and difficulty in acquiring data led to the studies mentioned above being focused on non point source pollution in small or medium river basins with relatively simple environments the results of those studies have not yet been applied to larger river basins for complex and large basins large amount of data is needed and the modeling process takes a long time more over it is difficult to apply general management measures uniformly throughout a large and complex river basin and the appropriate management efficiency may not be achieved even when a great deal of money is available when carrying out pollution control therefore it is necessary to have a comprehensive understanding of the composition of pollution sources and the spatiotemporal variation patterns in the river basin so as to clarify the current situation of pollution in the river basin more directly and provide a basis for the determination of river basin control measures carey et al 2013 first an overall assessment of the pollution status of the large basin needs to be performed and the pollutant sources need to be classified and traced the aspects that should be focused on to control and decrease pollutant emissions then need to be identified from the temporal and spatial distributions of the pollutants the results can then be used to develop appropriate management systems that can be implemented with as little difficulty as possible and that keep economic costs as low as possible in this study a distributed water sediment and pollutant model for a river basin was developed using the jialing river basin as an example based on the swat model qualitative and quantitative assessments of the spatial and temporal distributions of water sediment n losses and p losses in the jialing river basin were performed from the macroscopic view of the whole basin the sources of pollutants were identified and the effects of various management situations on the n and p loss rates and pollution of the water bodies in the basin were assessed 2 study area the jialing river is 1345 km long and the area of the basin is 144 122 km2 the river is a major tributary of the upper reaches of the yangtze river and drains into the yangtze river from the north the river has a larger drainage basin than the other tributaries of the yangtze river the jialing river basin jrb has many branches and the main ones are the qu river and fu river which are on the east and west respectively of the main river fig 1 there are many twists and turns in the upper reaches of the river and the valleys are dominated by deep cut canyons this means that mud rock flows landslides and sudden floods are common these events cause soil erosion and water pollution the middle reaches are relatively more gentle and the terrain slowly changes from alpine hills to shallow hills the downstream basin is relatively flat the variations in topography in the jrb have caused the population density distribution to be uneven the jrb is in the subtropical humid monsoon climate zone perennial average rainfall at 24 weather stations in the basin ranges from 471 mm to 1248 mm and the average annual rainfall is 873 mm the rainfall distribution is not uniform throughout the year rainfall from may to september accounts for 77 3 of the total annual rainfall cultivated land accounts for 46 4 of the total area of the basin forest accounts for 31 7 and grassland accounts for 18 7 the cultivated land adopts rotation system mainly planting rice and wheat the abundant rainfall and land use being predominantly arable agriculture have made agriculture an important economic activity in the jrb agricultural activities directly affect the aquatic environment topographic and geological factors over cultivation and other activities have caused large scale soil erosion in the jrb soil erosion caused by cultivation accounts for 60 80 of erosion in the jrb zhang et al 2014 large amounts of n and p are lost from the land to the water because of erosion and agricultural practices and this causes environmental problems such as acidification of water bodies chen et al 2002 3 methods 3 1 hydrological model 3 1 1 model development in this study the arcswat model using the arcgis software extension module was used to establish a distributed water sediment and pollutant model for the watershed fig 2 a projected digital elevation model was used to divide the study area into 389 subbasins and 7744 hydrological response units the land uses were divided into cultivated land woodland grassland water urban land bare soil and other types cultivated land woodland and grassland together accounted for 96 8 of all land spaw software was used to calculate the saturated water conductivity bulk density and other attributes for various types of soil to establish the soil database daily rainfall temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation data from 24 meteorological stations were extracted from the chinese surface climatic dataset and used to construct the meteorological database during the establishment of the n and p database the sources of pollutants in the river basin were generalized into three types domestic industrial and agricultural the jrb covers a large area and includes parts of the provinces chongqing gansu shanxi and sichuan therefore some relevant socio economic data from the above mentioned municipalities over the years were also required in addition to hydrological data firstly the average daily discharge of domestic sewage was calculated according to the population of each administrative region in the population statistics bulletin and the data of per capita water consumption water consumption rate sewage concentration and sewage discharge coefficient in the water resources bulletin then according to the data of industrial added value and water consumption per ten thousand yuan of industrial added value in the statistical bulletin of national economic and social development the average daily emissions from industrial point sources in the basin were calculated and the positions of point sources of pollutants in the various administrative divisions were identified fig 1 to build a model of the point source pollution system in the river basin agricultural planting and fertilizer application data from the statistical bulletin were used to build a model of the non point source pollution system the data used to build the distributed water sediment and pollutant model for the jrb are shown in table 1 3 1 2 model calibration and verification some parameters needed to be adjusted after the model had been constructed to calibrate the model and verify that the accuracy of the model was satisfactory the parameters are usually adjusted manually and uniformly for an entire basin however the jialing river basin is large and has nine land use types and 51 soil types adjusting each parameter for the whole basin did not allow the model to be calibrated to give the required accuracy so the swat model was adjusted using the calibration and uncertainty procedures cup automatic parameter adjustment system and by making some manual adjustments swat cup 2012 an auxiliary software tool for the swat model could calibrate and verify the performance of the swat model and perform sensitivity and uncertainty analyses to improve the efficiency of the model calibration process the study area was divided into three parts the main river basin the fu river basin and the qu river basin and progress was made step by step according to the principle of runoff first sediment second n and p last the parameters for the upstream stations in each river basin were first adjusted so that the model output met the required accuracy the parameters for the middle and downstream stations were then successively adjusted keeping the parameters for upstream unchanged until the simulation results for the entire basin met the accuracy requirements measured runoff and sediment n and p concentrations at the beibei hydrological station at the end of the jialing river basin and the upstream jinyintai wusheng shehong donglin and fengtan hydrological stations were used to calibrate and verify the water sediment and pollutant model results sources and accuracy of the data used to verify the model calibration are shown in table 2 the coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe coefficient ens were used to evaluate the model calibration and verification results nash et al 1970 the larger the coefficient of determination r2 the stronger the correlation between the simulated and measured data the larger the nash sutcliffe coefficient the more reliable the mean simulated by the model yesuf et al 2015 an accurate simulation requires a coefficient of determination r2 0 6 and a nash sutcliffe coefficient 0 5 3 2 spatial and temporal watershed pollution characteristics and traceability analysis firstly the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of water sediment and n and p were calculated the initial simulation results verified by calibration were used as the baseline and the pollution sources in the baseline scenario were domestic industrial and agricultural the annual variation processes of water yield sediment yield total n and total p loss and their spatial distribution in 389 sub basins during 1977 2016 were analyzed the traceability analysis aims to calculate the contribution of each pollutant source to the total n and p in the river channel under different time scales scenario analysis was carried out through the constructed swat model that is one of the three pollution sources was excluded on the basis of the baseline scenario the difference between the scenario simulation results and the baseline value was the contribution value of the excluded pollution source to the total n and p in the river for example in order to estimate the n and p load caused by domestic sewage only industrial point sources and agricultural non point sources were input into the swat model and the difference between the simulated value and the baseline value under this scenario was the load caused by domestic sewage the n and p load caused by industrial point source and agricultural non point source can be obtained by analogy 3 3 watershed management measures best management practices are methods measures and operating procedures that can decrease or prevent water pollution best management practices include engineering and non engineering measures and maintenance procedures engineering measures must be selected paying attention to the migration and transformation of non point source pollutants and are usually aimed at changing or blocking the transmission routes of pollutants the aim of most non engineering measures is to control the release of non point source pollutants at their sources engineering measures and non engineering measures were combined after assessing the initial simulation results for the baseline scenario after the model had been calibrated and verified fertilizer application for farming is the main factor affecting n and p losses in the basin and could not be ignored after large amounts of fertilizer are applied to land surface runoff during heavy rainfall can wash away soil and unabsorbed fertilizer into rivers causing water pollution and increasing the costs of farming four non engineering measures a1 a4 were set up to reduce the fertilizer application amount in the agricultural module by 10 20 30 and 40 respectively to allow the relationship between the amount of fertilizer applied and n and p losses in the watershed to be assessed and to provide reference data for controlling agricultural non point source pollution in the jrb common engineering measures for controlling non point source pollution include converting farmland back to forest building terraces belt planting and creating filter belts in order to facilitate the implementation and lower the cost the parameters in the planning management operation module were changed and the simulation scenarios of filter belts with different widths of 0 5 m 1 m 1 5 m and 2 m were set in the cultivated land b1 b4 and woodland c1 c4 respectively the filter belt refers to a soil bund with a certain height and width located at the edge of a field or woodland which can reduce nutrients and pesticides in runoff when the surface runoff passes through control scenarios d1 d4 with same widths were used for the whole basin to explore the efficiency differences between spatially targeted implementation of project management measures and untargeted measures decreasing pollutant concentrations in industrial wastewater was used to manage point source pollution the industrial emissions in the input module of the model point source were respectively reduced by 5 10 15 and 20 e1 e4 to simulate the effect of decreasing point source emissions the results of the various scenarios including the baseline scenario were used to assess the effects of various management measures on non point source and point source pollutant emissions and on water quality in the jrb 4 results and discussions 4 1 calibration and verification of the swat model automatic calibration and sensitivity analysis of swat cup were combined with manual model parameter calibration the results indicated that the model was very sensitive to changes in the cn2 sol awc alpha bf slsubbsn usle p spcon spexp and other parameters the calibration verification and simulation results for runoff sediment and pollutants are described below measured monthly runoff data of jinyintai wusheng shehong fengtan and donglin hydrological stations for 1977 1985 beibei hydrological station for 1977 1985 and 1997 2016 were used to calibrate and verify the swat model runoff simulation the measured monthly sediment value for 1999 2012 and monthly total n value for 2004 2016 in beibei station were used for the calibration and verification of sediment and total n for the calibration of p simulation the data of total p from beibei station during 2012 2013 and the data of inorganic p from jinyintai station in 1980 were used calibration and verification results are shown in table 3 and figs 3 and 4 the calibration and verification results indicated that the distributed water sediment and pollutant model could be applied to the jrb in the subsequent investigations 4 2 analysis of the current status of the jialing river basin 4 2 1 temporal and spatial distributions of sediment and pollutant runoff the spatial distributions of the average annual amounts of water sediment and pollutants discharged in the subbasins are shown in fig 5 the maximum and minimum water yields for the 389 subbasins were 856 9 and 103 3 mm respectively the water yields were higher in the east and south and lower in the west and north fig 5 a the qu river basin had the highest water yield and the main river basin had the second highest which was caused by the spatial difference of rainfall the spatial distribution of the annual average sediment yield is shown in fig 5b the maximum and minimum sediment yields for subbasins were 1274 1 and 2 4 t ha respectively the sediment yields of 84 9 of the subbasins throughout the basin were 426 t ha the erosion of the soil will lead to the decline of soil fertility and the loss of top soil with the ability to conserve water and soil keesstra et al 2018b which may be part of the reason for the loss of n and p in the basin the degree of erosion were markedly higher in some areas in the upper reaches of the qu river basin and the middle reaches of the main river basin than in the other areas the spatial distribution of the average total n losses is shown in fig 5c the maximum and minimum total n loss for the basin were 21 55 and 1 08 kg ha respectively the highest total n loss value was for the qu river basin and the second highest was for the central part of the main river basin the distribution of the areas with the highest total n loss was very similar to the distribution of areas with the strongest runoff and erosion to a certain extent it can be explained that rain erosion is the main factor leading to the loss of total n and most of the subbasins with high total n loss runoff and erosion were forested this may be because the existence of different vegetation types will change conditions such as illumination soil surface temperature and microbial composition lan et al 2021 and there are differences in n absorption and fixation effects the spatial distribution of the average total p losses is shown in fig 5d the maximum and minimum total p loss for the basin were 11 42 kg ha and 0 01 kg ha respectively cultivated land is the dominant type of land in the fu river basin and the lower reaches of the main river basin these areas accounted for 33 4 of the entire basin but up to 61 5 of total p loss showed that human activities such as fertilization in agriculture were the main sources of p loss interannual variations in water sediment n and p losses at the outlet of the basin are shown in fig 6 interannual variations in runoff sediment loss and total n loss were relatively large the variation trends of the three have a certain similarity which is consistent with the spatial distribution and interannual variations in total p losses were relatively small the amounts of runoff and total n lost generally decreased between 1977 and 2016 but the amounts of sediment and total p lost generally increased the multi year average total n and total p concentrations in the river water at the basin outlet were 2 03 and 0 16 mg l respectively which put them in categories five and three respectively of the chinese surface water environmental quality standard gb3838 2002 however the concentration of total n and total p could reach 2 36 mg l and 0 27 mg l which were the standard of the inferior fifth and fourth class when the water quality was in the worst condition water sediment n and p losses at the basin outlet each month over a year are shown in fig 7 runoff and sediment loss followed very similar trends the water and sediment yields increased steadily from january to june reached maxima in july and then gradually decreased the trend for runoff and erosion remained consistent the total n and total p losses followed similar trends to the amount of runoff however the total n and total p losses changed to different degrees between january and june reached maxima in july and then gradually decreased the smallest amounts of n and p were lost in february and december respectively 4 2 2 tracing the sources of nitrogen and phosphorus the tracing results for total n and p loss are shown in table 4 it can be seen that industrial wastewater were the main contributors of total n to the basin and non point sources fertilizer application were the next most important contributors of the three sources in terms of the whole year non point sources fertilizer application were the main sources of total p this is consistent with the distribution of the largest p loss in the cultivated area in spatial analysis the seasonality of agricultural activities meant that the contributions of different pollution sources to n and p pollution were different in different seasons non point source pollution occupied a dominant position in spring and summer when fertilization is more frequent while pollutants came more from domestic and industrial point source pollution in autumn and winter the contribution of point source to the loss of n and p varied little in different seasons due to the small seasonal factors therefore hydrological factors such as soil and water loss should be taken into full consideration when carrying out water environment control in jrb and targeted management should be carried out in key areas and periods according to pollutant sources and spatio temporal distribution characteristics 4 3 response of the basin to management measures 4 3 1 measures to manage non point source pollution as can be seen from the simulation results of scenario a table 5 there was a direct relationship between non engineering measures to change fertilizer application amount and water quality in the basin the loss of n and p could be decreased by decreasing the amount of fertilizer used under the baseline an approximately linear relationship was found between total n and total p losses at the basin outlet and the amount of fertilizer applied the total n concentration in the river decrease by 85 t 0 64 when the amount of fertilizer applied decreased by 10 total p losses were more sensitive to relative changes and decreased by 74 t 7 3 decreasing the amount of chemical fertilizer applied could therefore effectively decrease n and p losses while little affecting water and sediment losses in the basin similar to the control of fertilizer application the engineering measures to set up filter belt of cultivated land and woodland also had a small impact on the water and sediment but had a greater impact on water quality the results for the scenario b simulation shown in table 5 indicated that increasing the width of the cultivated land filter belt by 0 5 m decreased total n loss at the basin outlet by 216 t 2 and total p loss by 45 t 4 5 the problem of p loss in cultivated land was more prominent compared with other land types so the response of cultivated land to p load was more sensitive than that to n load under the same management measures in terms of relative change amplitude the results of the scenario c simulation shown in table 5 indicated that increasing the forest filter belt width by 0 5 m decreased the total n load at the basin outlet by 571 t 4 4 and the total p load by 0 7 t 0 07 because woodland was the main land use type in the areas with serious n pollution the efficiency of reducing n pollution in woodland filter belt was much higher than that of cultivated land at the same time the control scenario showed that the decrease in the amount of total p lost caused by implementing management measures on the cultivated land area almost half of the total watershed area was approximately the same as the decrease caused by applying the management measures to the entire watershed for the forested land 31 7 of the watershed area total n intercepted by the forest filter belt accounted for 57 4 of the decrease in total n losses in scenario d targeted management of key areas was found to be much more effective than applying management measures to all areas as shown in table 6 4 3 2 measures to manage point source pollution the results for the scenario e simulation shown in table 5 indicated that there was little difference in the efficiency of n and p treatment by industrial point source emissions a 5 decrease in the concentration of wastewater discharged from industrial point sources decreased the total n load at the basin outlet by 91 t and the total p load by 7 9 t the declines were all around 0 7 in practice implementing management measures such as controlling fertilizer use establishing filter belts of different types and widths and decreasing point source concentrations can be combined in targeted ways to decrease pollutant emissions as efficiently and cheaply as possible 5 conclusions a distributed water sediment and pollutant model was applied to the basin of the jialing river a tributary of the yangtze river the spatial and temporal water sediment n and p distributions for the whole basin were assessed qualitatively and quantitatively and the sources of pollutants were identified changes in n and p losses from the basin under various management measures were then assessed four main conclusions were drawn 1 the water yield and the amount of total n lost were both higher in the east and south and lower in the west and north the maxima for both were in july and the annual values increased over time more erosion was found to occur in some parts of the upper reaches of the qu river basin and the middle reaches of the main river basin than in the other subbasins the areas from which the largest amounts of total p were lost were mainly in the lower reaches of the basin maximum erosion and total p loss occurred in july and decreased over time the total n loss spatial distribution matched the forested land distribution and the total p loss spatial distribution matched the cultivated land distribution 2 non point source pollution was dominant in spring and summer and point source pollution was dominant in fall and winter industrial emissions were generally the main sources of n and p loss was most closely related to non point source pollution caused by fertilizer application 3 controlling the amount of fertilizer applied establishing filter belts of different types and directly decreasing pollutant concentrations at point sources could all to different degrees decrease n and p losses in the watershed establishing woodland filter belt was found to decrease n loss more than other measures and establishing cultivated land filter belts and controlling fertilizer use were found to decrease p loss more than other measures controlling industrial point sources was applicable to reducing both n and p loss 4 implementing different management measures in key areas identified from the temporal and spatial distributions of pollutants in the river basin and tracing pollutant sources could effectively improve the pollutant

10017,tracing the main sources and spatial distributions of pollutants and quantifying the effects of various factors on soil erosion and pollution loads are important to allow appropriate management systems to be developed for large complex watersheds and allow water pollution to be controlled efficiently and economically a distributed water sediment and pollutant model was used to qualitatively and quantitatively assess temporal and spatial variations in water and sediment characteristics and nitrogen n and phosphorus p loss distributions in a basin from a macroscopic point of view and to trace the sources of pollutants using the jialing river basin as an example changes in n and p losses in the basin caused by various management practices were assessed the results indicated that the average annual water and sediment yield in the study area were 103 857 mm and 2 4 1274 1 t ha respectively the loss of total n and p were 1 1 21 6 kg ha and 0 01 11 2 kg ha the spatial distribution varied greatly but the annual variation trend was relatively stable the contribution of n from industrial point sources reached 1973 tons which was dominant and the total n distribution in the watershed was closely related to woodland total p pollution was most severe for cultivated land the p load caused by fertilization reached 805 tons which was significantly more than the point source discharge assessments of the effects of implementing various management practices in the watershed indicated that n losses would be decreased more effectively by filter belt in woodland than by other practices the total n loss would be reduced by 4 4 for every 0 5 m filter belt added to woodland the losses would be decreased more effectively by a cultivated land filter belt and controlling fertilizer application than by other practices the 0 5 m filter belt of cultivated land can reduce total p by 5 and reducing fertilization by 5 can reduce total p by 7 3 understanding the temporal and spatial distributions of pollutant sources in a river basin and tracing pollutant sources will allow appropriate management practices to be implemented in key areas to effectively control pollutants keywords nitrogen and phosphorus loss soil erosion management measures temporal and spatial distributions pollutants source tracing 1 introduction nitrogen n and phosphorus p which are essential elements for plant and animal growth and development are important components of the soil environment and vital to the ecological health of aquatic ecosystems excessive n and p loss not only causes pollution and eutrophication in aquatic environments but also adverse effects on aquatic life and decreases soil fertility and crop yields n and p losses are therefore important threats to water quality and agricultural development cui et al 2020 zhong et al 2020 zhu et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 mcisaac et al 2003 kim et al 2006 there is an urgent need for effective measures for controlling and decreasing n and p losses to be developed to allow sustainable development n and p in a river basin can be released into water at point sources and non point sources the main point sources are relatively easy to identify and treat wastewater and emissions of n and p in wastewater are well controlled in most countries while releases of n and p from non point sources are affected by many factors such as the topography climate soil land use vegetation cover precipitation and human activities srinivas et al 2020 shen et al 2008 complex and diverse release mechanisms make non point source pollution very variable widely distributed difficult to monitor and difficult to identify meaning it is difficult to treat water affected by non point source pollution zou et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 bryan et al 2011 dowd et al 2008 studies have shown that future precipitation changes caused by climate change alone will exacerbate water eutrophication in china india and southeast asia without intervention sinha et al 2017 many non point source pollution simulations have been performed including the simulation of temporal and spatial distributions of non point source pollution han et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 the study on the effects of watershed changes caused by human activities on hydrology and water quality keesstra et al 2018a shrestha et al 2018 wei et al 2018 rodrigo et al 2018 and the study on the effects of climate and other natural conditions on pollution loads in river basins yi et al 2020 zhou et al 2017 johnson et al 2015 glavan et al 2015 all of the studies mentioned above can be seen as attempts to identify the processes involved in non point source pollution caused by environmental changes and to assess the current pollution statuses of river basins many studies of methods for controlling non point source pollution caused by human activities have also been performed himanshu et al 2019 luo and wang 2019 hammad et al 2018 some studies of the economic costs and efficiencies of different management measures and ways of implementing policies to modify the management system have been performed liu et al 2020 schall et al 2018 haas et al 2017 the process based watershed model can simulate the movement of water and sediment as well as the transport and transformation of pollutants from different sources in the basin which can provide a reliable basis for non point source pollution mechanism research impact assessment and pollution control many process based watershed models have been applied to study watershed nutrient cycling including the hspf model ribarova et al 2008 the agnps model srivastava et al 2002 swrrb model esen et al 2008 and swat model zeiger et al 2021 etc in the past few decades the soil and water assessment tool swat model is a distributed hydrological model at the watershed scale that uses a day as its time unit the model can simulate hydrological processes and various pollution loads in complex basins with various land use modes soil types and management modes and predicts the long term effects of changes in climate management practices and other factors on water yield sediment yield and aquatic environment pollution in the basins borah et al 2003 gassman et al 2007 arnold et al 2005 however the characteristics of non point source pollution variability broad distribution and difficulty in acquiring data led to the studies mentioned above being focused on non point source pollution in small or medium river basins with relatively simple environments the results of those studies have not yet been applied to larger river basins for complex and large basins large amount of data is needed and the modeling process takes a long time more over it is difficult to apply general management measures uniformly throughout a large and complex river basin and the appropriate management efficiency may not be achieved even when a great deal of money is available when carrying out pollution control therefore it is necessary to have a comprehensive understanding of the composition of pollution sources and the spatiotemporal variation patterns in the river basin so as to clarify the current situation of pollution in the river basin more directly and provide a basis for the determination of river basin control measures carey et al 2013 first an overall assessment of the pollution status of the large basin needs to be performed and the pollutant sources need to be classified and traced the aspects that should be focused on to control and decrease pollutant emissions then need to be identified from the temporal and spatial distributions of the pollutants the results can then be used to develop appropriate management systems that can be implemented with as little difficulty as possible and that keep economic costs as low as possible in this study a distributed water sediment and pollutant model for a river basin was developed using the jialing river basin as an example based on the swat model qualitative and quantitative assessments of the spatial and temporal distributions of water sediment n losses and p losses in the jialing river basin were performed from the macroscopic view of the whole basin the sources of pollutants were identified and the effects of various management situations on the n and p loss rates and pollution of the water bodies in the basin were assessed 2 study area the jialing river is 1345 km long and the area of the basin is 144 122 km2 the river is a major tributary of the upper reaches of the yangtze river and drains into the yangtze river from the north the river has a larger drainage basin than the other tributaries of the yangtze river the jialing river basin jrb has many branches and the main ones are the qu river and fu river which are on the east and west respectively of the main river fig 1 there are many twists and turns in the upper reaches of the river and the valleys are dominated by deep cut canyons this means that mud rock flows landslides and sudden floods are common these events cause soil erosion and water pollution the middle reaches are relatively more gentle and the terrain slowly changes from alpine hills to shallow hills the downstream basin is relatively flat the variations in topography in the jrb have caused the population density distribution to be uneven the jrb is in the subtropical humid monsoon climate zone perennial average rainfall at 24 weather stations in the basin ranges from 471 mm to 1248 mm and the average annual rainfall is 873 mm the rainfall distribution is not uniform throughout the year rainfall from may to september accounts for 77 3 of the total annual rainfall cultivated land accounts for 46 4 of the total area of the basin forest accounts for 31 7 and grassland accounts for 18 7 the cultivated land adopts rotation system mainly planting rice and wheat the abundant rainfall and land use being predominantly arable agriculture have made agriculture an important economic activity in the jrb agricultural activities directly affect the aquatic environment topographic and geological factors over cultivation and other activities have caused large scale soil erosion in the jrb soil erosion caused by cultivation accounts for 60 80 of erosion in the jrb zhang et al 2014 large amounts of n and p are lost from the land to the water because of erosion and agricultural practices and this causes environmental problems such as acidification of water bodies chen et al 2002 3 methods 3 1 hydrological model 3 1 1 model development in this study the arcswat model using the arcgis software extension module was used to establish a distributed water sediment and pollutant model for the watershed fig 2 a projected digital elevation model was used to divide the study area into 389 subbasins and 7744 hydrological response units the land uses were divided into cultivated land woodland grassland water urban land bare soil and other types cultivated land woodland and grassland together accounted for 96 8 of all land spaw software was used to calculate the saturated water conductivity bulk density and other attributes for various types of soil to establish the soil database daily rainfall temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation data from 24 meteorological stations were extracted from the chinese surface climatic dataset and used to construct the meteorological database during the establishment of the n and p database the sources of pollutants in the river basin were generalized into three types domestic industrial and agricultural the jrb covers a large area and includes parts of the provinces chongqing gansu shanxi and sichuan therefore some relevant socio economic data from the above mentioned municipalities over the years were also required in addition to hydrological data firstly the average daily discharge of domestic sewage was calculated according to the population of each administrative region in the population statistics bulletin and the data of per capita water consumption water consumption rate sewage concentration and sewage discharge coefficient in the water resources bulletin then according to the data of industrial added value and water consumption per ten thousand yuan of industrial added value in the statistical bulletin of national economic and social development the average daily emissions from industrial point sources in the basin were calculated and the positions of point sources of pollutants in the various administrative divisions were identified fig 1 to build a model of the point source pollution system in the river basin agricultural planting and fertilizer application data from the statistical bulletin were used to build a model of the non point source pollution system the data used to build the distributed water sediment and pollutant model for the jrb are shown in table 1 3 1 2 model calibration and verification some parameters needed to be adjusted after the model had been constructed to calibrate the model and verify that the accuracy of the model was satisfactory the parameters are usually adjusted manually and uniformly for an entire basin however the jialing river basin is large and has nine land use types and 51 soil types adjusting each parameter for the whole basin did not allow the model to be calibrated to give the required accuracy so the swat model was adjusted using the calibration and uncertainty procedures cup automatic parameter adjustment system and by making some manual adjustments swat cup 2012 an auxiliary software tool for the swat model could calibrate and verify the performance of the swat model and perform sensitivity and uncertainty analyses to improve the efficiency of the model calibration process the study area was divided into three parts the main river basin the fu river basin and the qu river basin and progress was made step by step according to the principle of runoff first sediment second n and p last the parameters for the upstream stations in each river basin were first adjusted so that the model output met the required accuracy the parameters for the middle and downstream stations were then successively adjusted keeping the parameters for upstream unchanged until the simulation results for the entire basin met the accuracy requirements measured runoff and sediment n and p concentrations at the beibei hydrological station at the end of the jialing river basin and the upstream jinyintai wusheng shehong donglin and fengtan hydrological stations were used to calibrate and verify the water sediment and pollutant model results sources and accuracy of the data used to verify the model calibration are shown in table 2 the coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe coefficient ens were used to evaluate the model calibration and verification results nash et al 1970 the larger the coefficient of determination r2 the stronger the correlation between the simulated and measured data the larger the nash sutcliffe coefficient the more reliable the mean simulated by the model yesuf et al 2015 an accurate simulation requires a coefficient of determination r2 0 6 and a nash sutcliffe coefficient 0 5 3 2 spatial and temporal watershed pollution characteristics and traceability analysis firstly the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of water sediment and n and p were calculated the initial simulation results verified by calibration were used as the baseline and the pollution sources in the baseline scenario were domestic industrial and agricultural the annual variation processes of water yield sediment yield total n and total p loss and their spatial distribution in 389 sub basins during 1977 2016 were analyzed the traceability analysis aims to calculate the contribution of each pollutant source to the total n and p in the river channel under different time scales scenario analysis was carried out through the constructed swat model that is one of the three pollution sources was excluded on the basis of the baseline scenario the difference between the scenario simulation results and the baseline value was the contribution value of the excluded pollution source to the total n and p in the river for example in order to estimate the n and p load caused by domestic sewage only industrial point sources and agricultural non point sources were input into the swat model and the difference between the simulated value and the baseline value under this scenario was the load caused by domestic sewage the n and p load caused by industrial point source and agricultural non point source can be obtained by analogy 3 3 watershed management measures best management practices are methods measures and operating procedures that can decrease or prevent water pollution best management practices include engineering and non engineering measures and maintenance procedures engineering measures must be selected paying attention to the migration and transformation of non point source pollutants and are usually aimed at changing or blocking the transmission routes of pollutants the aim of most non engineering measures is to control the release of non point source pollutants at their sources engineering measures and non engineering measures were combined after assessing the initial simulation results for the baseline scenario after the model had been calibrated and verified fertilizer application for farming is the main factor affecting n and p losses in the basin and could not be ignored after large amounts of fertilizer are applied to land surface runoff during heavy rainfall can wash away soil and unabsorbed fertilizer into rivers causing water pollution and increasing the costs of farming four non engineering measures a1 a4 were set up to reduce the fertilizer application amount in the agricultural module by 10 20 30 and 40 respectively to allow the relationship between the amount of fertilizer applied and n and p losses in the watershed to be assessed and to provide reference data for controlling agricultural non point source pollution in the jrb common engineering measures for controlling non point source pollution include converting farmland back to forest building terraces belt planting and creating filter belts in order to facilitate the implementation and lower the cost the parameters in the planning management operation module were changed and the simulation scenarios of filter belts with different widths of 0 5 m 1 m 1 5 m and 2 m were set in the cultivated land b1 b4 and woodland c1 c4 respectively the filter belt refers to a soil bund with a certain height and width located at the edge of a field or woodland which can reduce nutrients and pesticides in runoff when the surface runoff passes through control scenarios d1 d4 with same widths were used for the whole basin to explore the efficiency differences between spatially targeted implementation of project management measures and untargeted measures decreasing pollutant concentrations in industrial wastewater was used to manage point source pollution the industrial emissions in the input module of the model point source were respectively reduced by 5 10 15 and 20 e1 e4 to simulate the effect of decreasing point source emissions the results of the various scenarios including the baseline scenario were used to assess the effects of various management measures on non point source and point source pollutant emissions and on water quality in the jrb 4 results and discussions 4 1 calibration and verification of the swat model automatic calibration and sensitivity analysis of swat cup were combined with manual model parameter calibration the results indicated that the model was very sensitive to changes in the cn2 sol awc alpha bf slsubbsn usle p spcon spexp and other parameters the calibration verification and simulation results for runoff sediment and pollutants are described below measured monthly runoff data of jinyintai wusheng shehong fengtan and donglin hydrological stations for 1977 1985 beibei hydrological station for 1977 1985 and 1997 2016 were used to calibrate and verify the swat model runoff simulation the measured monthly sediment value for 1999 2012 and monthly total n value for 2004 2016 in beibei station were used for the calibration and verification of sediment and total n for the calibration of p simulation the data of total p from beibei station during 2012 2013 and the data of inorganic p from jinyintai station in 1980 were used calibration and verification results are shown in table 3 and figs 3 and 4 the calibration and verification results indicated that the distributed water sediment and pollutant model could be applied to the jrb in the subsequent investigations 4 2 analysis of the current status of the jialing river basin 4 2 1 temporal and spatial distributions of sediment and pollutant runoff the spatial distributions of the average annual amounts of water sediment and pollutants discharged in the subbasins are shown in fig 5 the maximum and minimum water yields for the 389 subbasins were 856 9 and 103 3 mm respectively the water yields were higher in the east and south and lower in the west and north fig 5 a the qu river basin had the highest water yield and the main river basin had the second highest which was caused by the spatial difference of rainfall the spatial distribution of the annual average sediment yield is shown in fig 5b the maximum and minimum sediment yields for subbasins were 1274 1 and 2 4 t ha respectively the sediment yields of 84 9 of the subbasins throughout the basin were 426 t ha the erosion of the soil will lead to the decline of soil fertility and the loss of top soil with the ability to conserve water and soil keesstra et al 2018b which may be part of the reason for the loss of n and p in the basin the degree of erosion were markedly higher in some areas in the upper reaches of the qu river basin and the middle reaches of the main river basin than in the other areas the spatial distribution of the average total n losses is shown in fig 5c the maximum and minimum total n loss for the basin were 21 55 and 1 08 kg ha respectively the highest total n loss value was for the qu river basin and the second highest was for the central part of the main river basin the distribution of the areas with the highest total n loss was very similar to the distribution of areas with the strongest runoff and erosion to a certain extent it can be explained that rain erosion is the main factor leading to the loss of total n and most of the subbasins with high total n loss runoff and erosion were forested this may be because the existence of different vegetation types will change conditions such as illumination soil surface temperature and microbial composition lan et al 2021 and there are differences in n absorption and fixation effects the spatial distribution of the average total p losses is shown in fig 5d the maximum and minimum total p loss for the basin were 11 42 kg ha and 0 01 kg ha respectively cultivated land is the dominant type of land in the fu river basin and the lower reaches of the main river basin these areas accounted for 33 4 of the entire basin but up to 61 5 of total p loss showed that human activities such as fertilization in agriculture were the main sources of p loss interannual variations in water sediment n and p losses at the outlet of the basin are shown in fig 6 interannual variations in runoff sediment loss and total n loss were relatively large the variation trends of the three have a certain similarity which is consistent with the spatial distribution and interannual variations in total p losses were relatively small the amounts of runoff and total n lost generally decreased between 1977 and 2016 but the amounts of sediment and total p lost generally increased the multi year average total n and total p concentrations in the river water at the basin outlet were 2 03 and 0 16 mg l respectively which put them in categories five and three respectively of the chinese surface water environmental quality standard gb3838 2002 however the concentration of total n and total p could reach 2 36 mg l and 0 27 mg l which were the standard of the inferior fifth and fourth class when the water quality was in the worst condition water sediment n and p losses at the basin outlet each month over a year are shown in fig 7 runoff and sediment loss followed very similar trends the water and sediment yields increased steadily from january to june reached maxima in july and then gradually decreased the trend for runoff and erosion remained consistent the total n and total p losses followed similar trends to the amount of runoff however the total n and total p losses changed to different degrees between january and june reached maxima in july and then gradually decreased the smallest amounts of n and p were lost in february and december respectively 4 2 2 tracing the sources of nitrogen and phosphorus the tracing results for total n and p loss are shown in table 4 it can be seen that industrial wastewater were the main contributors of total n to the basin and non point sources fertilizer application were the next most important contributors of the three sources in terms of the whole year non point sources fertilizer application were the main sources of total p this is consistent with the distribution of the largest p loss in the cultivated area in spatial analysis the seasonality of agricultural activities meant that the contributions of different pollution sources to n and p pollution were different in different seasons non point source pollution occupied a dominant position in spring and summer when fertilization is more frequent while pollutants came more from domestic and industrial point source pollution in autumn and winter the contribution of point source to the loss of n and p varied little in different seasons due to the small seasonal factors therefore hydrological factors such as soil and water loss should be taken into full consideration when carrying out water environment control in jrb and targeted management should be carried out in key areas and periods according to pollutant sources and spatio temporal distribution characteristics 4 3 response of the basin to management measures 4 3 1 measures to manage non point source pollution as can be seen from the simulation results of scenario a table 5 there was a direct relationship between non engineering measures to change fertilizer application amount and water quality in the basin the loss of n and p could be decreased by decreasing the amount of fertilizer used under the baseline an approximately linear relationship was found between total n and total p losses at the basin outlet and the amount of fertilizer applied the total n concentration in the river decrease by 85 t 0 64 when the amount of fertilizer applied decreased by 10 total p losses were more sensitive to relative changes and decreased by 74 t 7 3 decreasing the amount of chemical fertilizer applied could therefore effectively decrease n and p losses while little affecting water and sediment losses in the basin similar to the control of fertilizer application the engineering measures to set up filter belt of cultivated land and woodland also had a small impact on the water and sediment but had a greater impact on water quality the results for the scenario b simulation shown in table 5 indicated that increasing the width of the cultivated land filter belt by 0 5 m decreased total n loss at the basin outlet by 216 t 2 and total p loss by 45 t 4 5 the problem of p loss in cultivated land was more prominent compared with other land types so the response of cultivated land to p load was more sensitive than that to n load under the same management measures in terms of relative change amplitude the results of the scenario c simulation shown in table 5 indicated that increasing the forest filter belt width by 0 5 m decreased the total n load at the basin outlet by 571 t 4 4 and the total p load by 0 7 t 0 07 because woodland was the main land use type in the areas with serious n pollution the efficiency of reducing n pollution in woodland filter belt was much higher than that of cultivated land at the same time the control scenario showed that the decrease in the amount of total p lost caused by implementing management measures on the cultivated land area almost half of the total watershed area was approximately the same as the decrease caused by applying the management measures to the entire watershed for the forested land 31 7 of the watershed area total n intercepted by the forest filter belt accounted for 57 4 of the decrease in total n losses in scenario d targeted management of key areas was found to be much more effective than applying management measures to all areas as shown in table 6 4 3 2 measures to manage point source pollution the results for the scenario e simulation shown in table 5 indicated that there was little difference in the efficiency of n and p treatment by industrial point source emissions a 5 decrease in the concentration of wastewater discharged from industrial point sources decreased the total n load at the basin outlet by 91 t and the total p load by 7 9 t the declines were all around 0 7 in practice implementing management measures such as controlling fertilizer use establishing filter belts of different types and widths and decreasing point source concentrations can be combined in targeted ways to decrease pollutant emissions as efficiently and cheaply as possible 5 conclusions a distributed water sediment and pollutant model was applied to the basin of the jialing river a tributary of the yangtze river the spatial and temporal water sediment n and p distributions for the whole basin were assessed qualitatively and quantitatively and the sources of pollutants were identified changes in n and p losses from the basin under various management measures were then assessed four main conclusions were drawn 1 the water yield and the amount of total n lost were both higher in the east and south and lower in the west and north the maxima for both were in july and the annual values increased over time more erosion was found to occur in some parts of the upper reaches of the qu river basin and the middle reaches of the main river basin than in the other subbasins the areas from which the largest amounts of total p were lost were mainly in the lower reaches of the basin maximum erosion and total p loss occurred in july and decreased over time the total n loss spatial distribution matched the forested land distribution and the total p loss spatial distribution matched the cultivated land distribution 2 non point source pollution was dominant in spring and summer and point source pollution was dominant in fall and winter industrial emissions were generally the main sources of n and p loss was most closely related to non point source pollution caused by fertilizer application 3 controlling the amount of fertilizer applied establishing filter belts of different types and directly decreasing pollutant concentrations at point sources could all to different degrees decrease n and p losses in the watershed establishing woodland filter belt was found to decrease n loss more than other measures and establishing cultivated land filter belts and controlling fertilizer use were found to decrease p loss more than other measures controlling industrial point sources was applicable to reducing both n and p loss 4 implementing different management measures in key areas identified from the temporal and spatial distributions of pollutants in the river basin and tracing pollutant sources could effectively improve the pollutant

10018,the relationship between different rainfall types different soil management practices and soil erosion is not yet fully understood in situ observations of soil and water loss on sloping farmland in the red soil region of southern china with a subtropical monsoon environment were taken at 12 runoff plots with four treatments i e downslope ridges downslope ridges with hedgerow intercropping contour ridges and bare flat land as control over a seven year period from 2012 to 2018 during this time 253 natural rainfall events were classified into three rainfall types by k means clustering according to the rainfall depth maximum 30 min rainfall intensity and rainfall duration and surface runoff and soil erosion processes in relation to the rainfall types under different ridge practices were analyzed the results show that water induced soil erosion on the flat land control was significant with average annual soil loss of 76 73 t ha 1 yr 1 reaching the intense erosion classification and ridge practices were confirmed to reduce annual runoff and soil loss in all rainfall events by 18 9 62 0 and 68 9 86 3 respectively on the whole rainfall events can be divided into three types intense normal and long duration among them intense and normal rainfall cause the majority of soil 88 5 93 7 and water 75 0 83 8 loss in this area but the efficiencies in runoff and soil reduction during long duration rainfall events were the lowest or even negative on farmlands with only downslope ridges 20 of the total rainfall events in which 84 3 92 2 were intense and normal rainfall events contributed to 29 33 of the total rainfall depth 68 89 of the total runoff depth and 94 98 of the total soil loss rainfall depth played a dominant role in generating runoff while runoff accumulation was a main factor influencing on soil loss findings from our study indicate that by choosing a more appropriate ridge practice according to different rainfall types there can be a positive effect on soil and water conservation keywords water erosion k means clustering soil and water conservation red soil region 1 introduction maintaining healthy soil is the foundation of agriculture and is an

degradation neutrality challenges guadie et al 2020 the red soil region in southern china is an important agricultural production area huang and zhao 2014 accounting for 36 of the total cultivated land and for more than 50 of the total oil bearing crops grain and agricultural outputs from china huang 2017 due to high precipitation hilly landforms and unsustainable farming practices the red soil region has been facing severe soil and water loss barton et al 2004 fang et al 2017 according to liang et al 2010 and zheng et al 2021 sloping farmland is the primary source of soil erosion and the rate of soil loss can reach 98 78 t ha 1 yr 1 in the red soil region currently research examining soil erosion and suitable control measures for sloping farmland have been successfully undertaken in the region shi et al 2014 yang et al 2013 fang et al 2017 dai et al 2018 however due to obvious differences in topography soil types crop types and farming habits in different study areas findings from previous investigations report different results and long term field observation experiments are still insufficient soil erosion processes on sloping farmland are affected by different ridge practices that change the surface micro topography at present research findings about the effect of surface morphology on erosion process are basically consistent the surface morphology intercepts rainwater through the hollows changing the source and sink processes and the paths by which water is gathered and dispersed in turn affecting the surface runoff and soil loss appels et al 2016 furthermore compared with flat terrain concave terrain makes the surface runoff and sediment generation process have a more obvious boundary effect the greater the undulation and roughness of the surfaces the more significant the time delays of surface runoff and sediment generation zhao et al 2018 many studies have shown that by applying ridge practices on sloping farmland e g ridge hayrick field tied ridges and downslope ridges plus contour hedgerows soil erosion is significantly reduced ngetich et al 2014 xie et al 2015 grum et al 2017 yang et al 2013 dai et al 2018 for example grum et al 2017 carried out field experiments during the rainy seasons in arid and semi arid environments and showed that tied ridges significantly reduced runoff by 56 and improved soil moisture content compared with normal agricultural practices without ridge treatments ngetich et al 2014 reported that tied ridging was the most efficient measure among selected tillage practices in reducing runoff and sediment yield in semi arid regions compared with flat tillage ridge tillage is widely used in the red soil region of southern china with humid subtropical environments where the alternation of dry and wet soil is frequent and can improve the temperature light water and fertilizer conditions during crop growth however poorly chosen ridging practices are an important cause of high surface runoff and soil erosion even with maximum vegetation coverage of 80 poor choices in ridging can still cause serious soil erosion liang et al 2010 a comparison between different ridge management strategies on sloping farmland need to be examined in order to determine best practices for reducing erosion and runoff damage rainfall is another primary factor influencing runoff generation and soil erosion truman et al 2007 girmay et al 2009 huo et al 2020 the impacts of rainfall characteristics e g rainfall intensity duration depth and type on runoff and soil erosion have been and continue to be extensively studied de lima et al 2003 kinnell 2005 dos santos et al 2017 chen et al 2018 among important rainfall characteristics rainfall type is the complex primary factor influencing hydrological and erosion processes ran et al 2012 results from past studies show that due to differences in climate rainfall in different regions is classified differently and has unique relationships with soil erosion the significant relationship between rainfall runoff erosion processes is also significantly impacted by management practices mchugh et al 2007 dagnew et al 2015 at present the classification of rainfall types for the study of soil erosion laws in china is mostly found in the northwest loess plateau which has a semi arid environment wei et al 2007 2014 ran et al 2012 fang et al 2008 the rainfall in the loess plateau can be divided into three regimes short duration and high intensity rainfall medium duration and medium intensity rainfall and long duration and low intensity rainfall among them short duration and high intensity rainfall is the main cause of soil erosion in this area the red soil region of southern china experiences a humid environment with annual average rainfall between 1200 and 2000 mm and has the greatest rainfall erosivity in china but there are few detailed studies about the effect of rainfall types on soil and water loss zhang et al 2011 qin et al 2015 for example huang et al 2010 used the rapid clustering method to divide erosive rainfall into four types and selected three of those types to compare the runoff and sediment yield changes of different vegetation restoration models another example of relevant research is that liu et al 2016 classified 393 rainfall events into five regimes by the k means clustering method and analyzed surface runoff subsurface flow and sediment loss processes in relation to the rainfall regimes under three land cover types as previously stated the red soil region in southern china has the highest rate of rainfall induced erosion in the country and the management practices used on the sloping farmland are diverse the relationship between different rainfall types different soil management measures and soil erosion remains unclear the goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of various ridge practices and rainfall types on surface runoff and soil loss on sloping red soil farmland with a humid subtropical environment in southern china the specific objectives were 1 to compare the differences in surface runoff and soil loss under different ridge practices 2 to determine the responses of surface runoff and soil loss under different rainfall types and 3 to study the role of different ridge practices on soil erosion control under different rainfall types findings from this study could ultimately lead to a better management of agricultural systems in the red soil region of southern china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was carried out at the jiangxi ecological park of soil and water conservation in the yangou watershed 115 42 38 115 43 06 e 29 16 37 29 17 40 n de an county jiangxi province china the study area was 15 km away from poyang lake which is the biggest freshwater lake in china the area has a subtropical monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature of 16 9 and a mean annual frost free period of 249 d mean annual precipitation in this area is 1449 mm with precipitation between april and september accounting for about 70 of the total annual precipitation the topography is generally characterized by low hills with elevations of 30 100 m the slopes across the area range from 5 to 25 this watershed belongs to the typical plain landform of a lake area with a concentrated distribution of sloping farmland crop rotations of winter rapeseed brassica napus and summer peanut arachis hypogaea l account for the use of the sloping farmland the soil dominated by a red soil developed from quaternary red clay is acidic to slightly acidic according to the u s soil taxonomy the dominant soil is generally classified as ultisol the total organic matter total nitrogen total phosphorus and total potassium contents of the tested soil 0 20 cm are 2 32 0 24 0 25 and 12 53 g kg 1 respectively its clay silt and sand contents are 46 85 47 39 and 5 76 respectively zheng et al 2021 natural resources and land use types in the yangou watershed are typical of the red soil region in southern china 2 2 experimental design and agricultural practices twelve in situ runoff plots were constructed on a waste grassland with a 10 gradient with similar soil conditions each plot was 20 m long 5 m wide and all plots were adjacent and parallel to the slope in order to retain external runoff each plot was surrounded by brick walls that were plastered with cement mortar these walls were inserted 30 cm into the ground and protruded 20 cm above the surface a rectangular drainage trough and a set of circular collecting buckets were installed on the lower slope of each plot to collect surface runoff and eroded sediment a water level gauge installed in each bucket was used to record the runoff volume for each rainfall event the construction of runoff plots was finished at the beginning of 2011 the twelve runoff plots were arranged in a randomized complete block design with the following treatments downslope ridge tillage dt downslope ridge tillage with hedgerows planted in contour dt hg contour ridge tillage ct and bare flat land as control ck fig 1 there were five planted ridges along the slope of each dt and dt hg plot and 20 planted ridges that contoured the slope of each ct plot each planted ridge was 70 cm wide 20 cm high and 200 cm long in each dt hg plot day lily hemerocallis citrina hedgerow was established every 5 m along the slope by transplanting seedlings on october 26 2011 day lily was planted in two rows at a spacing of 20 30 cm in each belt in order to reduce surface disturbance the hedge belts were maintained without tillage during the study period bare flat land was employed as the control treatment and the weeds in the runoff plots were manually removed every month according to local planting practices peanut summer and oil rapeseed winter were selected as crops for annual rotation peanut arachis hypogaea l was planted in each plot in late april and harvested in late august oil rapseed brassica napus was transplanted in late october and harvested in late april the ridge s surface was tilled in ridged plots and on the whole surface in ck plots soil was ploughed using a hoe to a depth of about 20 cm peanuts were sown at a density of about 100 000 holes per hectare with two seeds per hole and oil rapeseed was transplanted at a density of about 67 000 plants per hectare the cropping system and cultivation practices used were applied according to local typical agricultural management in the red soil region of southern china 2 3 in situ observations the observations of runoff and sediment under natural rainfall began in april 2011 to moderate the disturbances caused by plot construction surface runoff and sediment yield data runoff depth and soil loss used in this paper began in 2012 a rainfall event was not considered to be independent unless the rainfall interval was over 6 h renard et al 1997 surface runoff volume of each runoff event was calculated according to a pre determined water level volume ratio using the water level gauge installed in the runoff bucket after each rainfall event a runoff sample mixed with sediment was collected in an aluminum box and sediment concentration was determined by drying the sample in an oven to a constant weight at 105 c the sediment loss of each rainfall event was calculated by multiplying the runoff volume and sediment concentration notably if the drainage trough had accumulated bed load the dry weight of bed load was calculated after sampling and drying which was included in the total sediment loss of the erosive rain event precipitation was recorded using an automatic meteorological situated station 20 m from the experimental plots the start and end time of a rainfall event the rainfall intensity and the rainfall depth were recorded a total of 264 observations were recorded during the entire experiment among them 11 rainfall events were excluded from analysis as they occurred across holidays or festivals during which observations were not made consistently and were difficult to distinguish from independent erosive rainfall events 2 4 data processing in order to assess the effects of ridge practices and rainfall types surface runoff and sediment yield data runoff depth and soil loss were collected for 253 erosive rainfall events from 2012 to 2018 in this study k means clustering was used to classify rainfall types according to rainfall depth p maximum 30 min rainfall intensity i30 and rainfall duration d the classification met the anova criterion for significance p 0 05 runoff depth r and soil loss s were calculated using the following formulas 1 r q a 1000 where r was runoff depth mm q was the runoff volume m3 and a was the runoff plot area 100 m2 2 s e a 10 where s was soil loss t ha 1 and e was erosive sediment kg runoff and sediment reduction of ridge management were calculated according to the comprehensive control of soil and water conservation method of benefit calculation gb t 15774 2008 of china as 3 η r r 0 r m r 0 100 4 η s s 0 s m s 0 100 where η r and η s are runoff reduction and sediment reduction respectively r m and r 0 are the runoff depth of ridged management plots and bare control plots mm respectively s m and s 0 are the soil loss from ridged management plots and bare control plots t ha 1 respectively the kolmogorov smirnov test showed that the data were normally or log normally distributed the one way anova test was used to test for differences in surface runoff and sediment yield between different management types and rainfall types spearman correlation was used to illustrate the correlations between the runoff depth the soil loss and rainfall characteristics spss 17 0 was used to perform statistical analysis and originpro 2019b was used to draw charts 3 results 3 1 description of erosive rainfall events the 253 erosive rainfall events used in this study were divided into three groups by k means clustering based on the rainfall depth the maximum 30 min rainfall intensity and the rainfall duration table 1 rainfall type iii was characterized by intense rainfall with the shortest duration 325 min and the lowest rainfall depth 22 6 mm but the highest maximum 30 min rainfall intensity 22 7 mm h 1 rainfall type iii occurred 108 times which was the highest frequency of any rainfall type rainfall type i long duration rainfall included rainfall events that had the greatest depth 51 7 mm the longest duration 1888 min and the lowest maximum 30 min rainfall intensity 15 5 mm h 1 but also the lowest frequency with only 53 such events observed rainfall type ii characterized by normal rainfall had a moderate depth moderate duration and moderate maximum 30 min rainfall intensity this rainfall type occurred 92 times during the seven years considering seasonal distributions fig 2 rainfall type i mainly occurred in spring from march to may and autumn from september to november with the total occurrence of 31 times and 58 5 probability rainfall type ii mainly occurred in spring with the highest seasonal occurrence of 47 times and 51 1 probability and rainfall type iii occurred both in spring and summer from june to august with 46 and 45 times and probabilities of 42 6 and 41 7 respectively 3 2 runoff and soil loss under different ridge practices fig 3 presents the results of average annual runoff and soil loss from the four treatments from 2012 to 2018 it was clear that the runoff and soil loss were strongly affected by ridge practices runoff depth was the highest and the lowest in ck and ct with average annual amounts of 179 86 and 68 40 mm respectively the average annual runoff depth in dt and dt hg was 145 79 and 84 34 mm respectively runoff depth was significantly p 0 05 lower in ct and dt gh compared with ck and dt the highest average annual soil loss was found in ck 76 73 t ha 1 yr 1 which had the poorest surface cover conditions followed by dt 23 86 t ha 1 yr 1 the lowest average annual soil loss was found in ct and dt hg both with 10 49 t ha 1 yr 1 soil loss was significantly p 0 05 lower in all ridge treatments than from the bare flat control significant p 0 05 differences were also shown in the average annual soil loss between dt and dt hg ct 3 3 runoff and sediment loss from different rainfall types fig 4a shows that mean annual runoff depth for the ck treatment demonstrated a significant decreasing trend p 0 05 from rainfall type ii iii i rainfall types ii and iii created significantly p 0 05 more runoff depth than that created in rainfall type i for the dt and dt hg treatments rainfall type ii created significantly p 0 05 more runoff depth from ct treatments compared with rainfall type i as shown in fig 4b rainfall type iii had the highest soil erosion for all treatments with mean annual soil loss ranging from 5 02 to 43 33 t ha 1 yr 1 rainfall type i showed the lowest soil erosion for the four treatments with mean annual soil loss ranging from 0 66 to 6 33 t ha 1 yr 1 soil loss across the three rainfall types showed significant p 0 05 differences under the ck treatment soil loss in rainfall type i showed a significant p 0 05 difference from the other rainfall types for dt ct and dt hg treatments on the whole it can be concluded from fig 4 that intense rainfall type iii events caused more soil loss whereas normal rainfall type ii events generated more runoff on the sloping farmland 4 discussion 4 1 effects of ridge practices on water induced erosion water induced soil erosion is a serious issue in the red soil region of southern china liang et al 2010 zheng et al 2021 due to the increase in cultivated vegetation coverage using a peanut rape rotation compared to that of bare land runoff generation and soil loss were reduced by an average of more than 18 9 and 68 9 respectively during the seven years of the study fig 3 however due to poor choice of soil management practices implemented in cultivated areas there are serious risks of soil and water losses experimental results fig 5 showed that annual soil loss from cultivated farmland with a conventional downslope tillage in the first year reached 55 99 t ha 1 yr 1 reaching classification as intense erosion 50 80 t ha 1 yr 1 according to the standards for classification and gradation of soil erosion scgse issued by the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china as the years since the land was reclaimed increased soil loss from the sloping farmland decreased but due to disturbances in the crop rotations annual soil loss continued to be large above 15 t ha 1 yr 1 tu et al 2018 analyzed the erosion characteristics under an orchard planting mode in the same study area and found that soil erosion during the first year after planting was the largest however after the trees reached maturity soil erosion decreased and 64 of the study years recorded annual soil loss rate with a tolerance of 5 t ha 1 yr 1 this study showed that soil erosion from farmland was severe and that crop farmland experienced longer erosion times than the orchard farmland these were consistent with other research results wei et al 2007 determined that crop land experienced the highest surface runoff and soil erosion in the loess hilly areas of china far more than those in other land use types cropland is strongly affected by human caused disturbances which disturbs the soil layer and reduces land coverage bagarello and ferro 2010 keesstra et al 2016b reported that the highest runoff and erosion amounts were seen in uncovered plots and the lowest values were identified in covered plots shui et al 2001 found annual soil loss rate from sloped red soil farmland in the first two years after development reached above 50 t ha 1 yr 1 with higher losses from crops than orchards this was due to serious disturbances of the surface soil that caused loose soil early in the planting period and by the frequent tillage with crop rotation practices that increased soil erodibility and the probability of severe erosion during the growing season on the other hand frequent tillage and serious disturbances homogenized the soils and created nearly uniformly slope at the plot scale while surface runoff and wash was produced nearly everywhere cerdà and rodrigo comino 2020 when efficient prevention and control measures are removed increased flow and sediment connectivity can cause serious water and soil erosion along the slope rodrigo comino et al 2018 the spatially uniformly distributed flow generation and soil erosion in the plot implied that the current tillage was not sustainable due to the lack of sink areas able to reduce the runoff and sediment discharge in the humid area cerdà and rodrigo comino 2020 hence to better prevent and control soil erosion from sloped farming systems with crop rotation best soil management practices should be undertaken all the time ridge practices are effective in reducing water induced erosion on sloping farmland with rotating crops in this study on average ct and dt hg treatments significantly decreased annual runoff depth more than 53 1 and these two treatments decreased annual soil losses by 86 3 when compared with the control moreover after the fourth year of monitoring the amount of annual soil loss on farmland with ct and dt hg treatments was lower 0 30 4 46 t ha 1 yr 1 respectively than the tolerable erosion rate 5 t ha 1 yr 1 for this region fig 5 contour ridges across the slope can greatly reshape the slope and change the direction of water flow from downward to horizontal effectively slowing the flow velocity and increasing the probability of soil infiltration forming barriers that trap sediment in runoff water generally contour tillage has the most obvious effect on reducing runoff and soil losses in the early stage of rainfall or rainfall with light intensity yang et al 2013 dai et al 2018 in this study there was an average decrease of 62 0 of the annual runoff depth and 86 3 of the annual soil loss in ct plots compared with the control the reduction of runoff and soil by hedgerows could be attributed to the hedgerow bases and stems blocking the path and to the reconstruction of micro topography such as a shortening of the slope length and a reduction of the slope gradient blanco canqui et al 2004 sudhishri et al 2008 adhikary et al 2017 zheng et al 2021 there was an average decrease of annual runoff depth and soil loss of 53 1 and 86 3 in the dt hg treatment compared with the control it is noteworthy that the perennial hedgerow started to play a role in intercepting sediment in the year after planting and started to play a role in intercepting runoff during the second year fig 5 these findings are in agreement with former studies he et al 2016 and li et al 2019 also found that sediment reduction occurred one year earlier than runoff reduction for leucaena leucocephala hedgerow after planting on purple sloping farmland in southwest china zheng et al 2021 reported that hemerocallis citrina hedgerow did not play a role in intercepting surface runoff during the first year after planting while it did affect sediment in its first year after planting on sloping red soil farmland in southern china this is because the first year after planting is considered the adaptation period in which perennial hedgerows do not intercept runoff from slopes during the second year after planting the hedgerow begins to have a mechanical interception effect on runoff and sediment to enhance the runoff reduction effects of the hedgerow it should be combined with straw mulching or other methods in the early stages of hedgerow construction the least effective measure in reducing runoff and sediment loss was downslope ridge tillage figs 3 and 5 the reason for these phenomena was that the planting ridges were parallel to the slope surface which was conducive to runoff collection causing the greatest runoff and sediment yield in the dt plots the differences of flow and sediment connectivity among ct dt hg and dt resulted in different effects barriers and contour ridges formed on and across the slope disconnected the flow and sediment between rows in the early stage or light rainfall events and reduced the connectivity even in moderate or heavy rainfall events the hedgerow created a topographical barrier that contributed to low connectivity between the upper and lower hedgerows boundaries for most rainfall events as more years post planting passed hedgerow slope became less connected as more soil collected on their upper boundaries via splash processes and tillage erosion rodrigo comino et al 2018 during rare large storm events a connection occurred between the upper and lower hedgerow boundaries the greatest reduction effects still appeared in the dt hg treatment even though they had a downslope ridge the well connectivity on the slope using dt treatment increased the connectivity of flow and sediment and resulted in the least reduction runoff and soil erosion in general the higher the connectivity the worse the control effect on runoff and soil erosion at the plot scale to enhance the reduction of soil erosion and runoff these findings suggest that a combination of measures such as grass hedges and straw mulching jointly provided the greatest reduction of erosion and the least connectivity on sloping farmland with downslope tillage 4 2 response of erosion in red soil regions to different rainfall types the impacts of rainfall types on runoff and soil erosion have been extensively studied wei et al 2007 2014 fang et al 2008 huang et al 2010 ran et al 2012 qin et al 2015 liu et al 2016 chen et al 2018 compared with the existing classification results of erosive rainfall in the red soil region of southern china zhang et al 2011 classified five types of rainfall using a 10 mm rainfall equivalent interval this classification method represents the average segmentation of rainfall and does not reflect the influence of rainfall intensity and other characteristics huang et al 2010 used the rapid clustering method to classify four types of rainfall however from the results one type of rainfall only contained one event while the average rainfall duration and maximum 30 min rainfall intensity of the other three types of rainfall in decreasing order were type iii type ii type i this classification result does not reflect the characteristics of different rainfall indicators in a rainfall event in this study the rainfall events were divided into three types by the rapid clustering method table 1 the probability of d and p under the rainfall type clustering function significance test with probability p 0 0001 and i30 under the rainfall type clustering function significance test with probability p 0 05 resulted in a better clustering effect utilizing this method produced results that were more in line with the actual observed conditions in the red soil region of southern china many studies have shown that different rainfall types can generate various runoff and soil erosion conditions jiao et al 1999 wei et al 2009 qin et al 2015 liu et al 2016 duan et al 2020 in this study the mean amount of annual soil loss for all treatments in order of greatest to least was rainfall iii rainfall ii rainfall i fig 4 with percentages of 45 2 56 5 35 3 45 9 and 6 3 11 5 respectively rainfall iii with the highest maximum 30 min rainfall intensity mean i30 was 22 7 mm h 1 the shortest duration mean duration was 325 min and the highest frequency 108 times table 1 created the most soil loss on sloping farmland and should be the focus of future prevention methods this result was similar to results from previous studies in the same area qin et al 2015 liu et al 2016 liu et al 2016 also found that rainfall regime v with characteristically high intensity short duration and high frequency had the highest sensitivity in sediment yield in the red soil region rainfall iii events exceeded the soil infiltration capacity and the excess rainfall was lost as surface runoff wei et al 2014 moreover the raindrops associated with type iii events have high kinetic energy and can damage the soil structure when they hit the ground van dijk et al 2002 wang et al 2019 as a consequence the rainfall iii events were assumed to dominate soil loss when compared to other rainfall type events other researchers have reported similar results in different areas wei et al 2007 peng and wang 2012 dos santos et al 2017 for example in the northwest loess plateau of china storms with short duration were also the main rainfall type that caused soil erosion wei et al 2007 accounting for more than 60 of soil erosion jiao et al 1999 the rainfall depth of a short duration rainstorm is between 10 and 30 mm and lasts between 30 and 120 min in the northwest loess plateau jiao et al 1999 soil erosion in the two regions is mainly caused by storms of short duration and tends to have approximately the same rainfall depth but the rainfall duration in the loess plateau tends to be shorter and of greater intensity than in the red soil region many studies have shown that water erosion tends to be caused by a few rainfall events especially those that are extreme duan et al 2020 ai et al 2015 zhang et al 2011 huang et al 2010 in this seven year study 20 of the rainfall events contributed 29 33 of the rainfall depth 95 98 of the total sediment and 68 89 of the total runoff on sloping farmland fig 6 among the 20 rainfall events 51 rainfall events rainfall type iii accounted for about 60 in the ck treatment while rainfall iii and ii events accounted for 37 47 and 43 47 in other treatments respectively obviously the extreme rainfall in type iii and ii events played the destructive role in inducing surface runoff and soil erosion as shown in this study better performance of management measures could weaken the destructive impact of different rainfall types on water erosion liu et al 2016 wang et al 2019 fig 7 shows the reductions achieved in runoff and soil loss as a whole ridge treatments significantly reduced soil and water loss for all rainfall events compared with the control however the effectiveness in runoff and soil reduction of the ridge measures differed across the three types of rainfall figs 7 and 8 for all ridge measures rainfall iii intense rainfall events had the largest effect on runoff depth 34 7 67 9 and soil loss 75 1 88 5 while rainfall i long duration rainfall events had the least reduction effect on runoff generation 24 8 to 60 3 and sediment yield 56 6 89 5 it is worth noting that the rate of runoff and sediment reduction in the dt treatment was the lowest under the three rainfall types and even had a negative effect 24 8 on reducing runoff under rainfall type i in the future more attention should be paid to managing long duration but low intensity and high precipitation rainfall events on farmlands with downslope ridges alone ridge management reduced soil loss more than runoff under different rainfall types fig 7 the effect of rainfall type on runoff and soil loss is associated with rainfall variables such as depth intensity and duration rainfall depth and intensity were confirmed as the main drivers of runoff and soil loss ran et al 2012 qin et al 2015 liu et al 2016 nearing et al 2017 past studies have shown that rainfall intensity plays a dominant role in soil loss van dijk et al 2002 kinnell 2005 while rainfall depth is the main factor influencing runoff mayor et al 2007 ziadat and taimeh 2013 huo et al 2020 spearman correlation analysis table 2 shows the effects of rainfall variables on the runoff depth and the soil loss were different among different rainfall types for rainfall types i and ii the rainfall depth contributed more to both runoff depth and soil loss however for rainfall type iii the maximum 30 min rainfall intensity contributed more to soil loss than the rainfall depth and the rainfall depth often contributed more to runoff depth results confirmed that except for the ck treatment the rainfall depth contributed more to runoff generation than the maximum 30 min rainfall intensity for all rainfall events in similar area mayor et al 2007 ziadat and taimeh 2013 huo et al 2020 previous studies have shown that linear power or exponential correlations have been used to describe the relationships between rainfall runoff and soil loss kothyari et al 2004 qin et al 2015 dai et al 2018 huo et al 2020 in our study regression analysis showed that runoff was significant p 0 05 and positively correlated with rainfall depth for each treatment while soil loss was more related to runoff depth table 3 4 3 soil erosion control using different ridge practices and other swcps in addition to using different ridge practices other swcps with various anti erosion mechanisms have been recognized as being effective in reducing water induced erosion as mentioned above ridge practice forms both a high convex ridge and a low concave ridge which changes the micromorphology of the sloping land and affects runoff and sediment connectivity each ridge simultaneously contributes to retaining soil and water and increasing precipitation infiltration mulching can be used as a useful management practice to control soil erosion rates due to the immediate effect on reducing the high soil detachment rate and runoff initiation by mitigating raindrops splash erosion and by reducing runoff generation and especially sediment losses keesstra et al 2019 straw mulch is also effective in managing soil and water loss via protection against splash erosion dai et al 2018 found that in southern china mulch was most effective at controlling water erosion under heavy rainfall because it provided a buffer for rain drops and increased infiltration catch crops and cover crops have also been recognized as effective agronomic practices to promote soil conservation mainly by increasing vegetation cover and surface roughness rodrigo comino et al 2020 reported the use of vicia sativa as an effective soil erosion control measure during the first stages of vineyard plantations lópez vicente et al 2020 pointed that cover crops minimized soil loss in permanent cropping systems where the soil was usually bare due to intense tillage or overuse of herbicides terracing is a typical mechanical swcp that can reduce soil erosion on sloping farmland terraced farmland can shorten the slope length change the terrain retain runoff and reduce or prevent erosion han et al 2020 even suffered from embankment failure the erosion modulus of terraced land 94 90 t ha 1 yr 1 was still less than that of sloped cropland dominated by rill gully erosion 112 52 t ha 1 yr 1 in a northern rocky mountainous area of china han et al 2020 a better understanding of the effect of swcps on runoff and soil erosion control could be helpful in determining the timing and selection of management practices to be adopted in different regions a review conducted for vineyard and olive orchards in mediterranean areas emphasized how appropriate measures differed between various climates with different constrains and foci novara et al 2021 temporary cover crop was suggested for drier environments due to water constraints while permanent species with high ground cover were suggested for wetter environments with a high risk of soil erosion and high yield quality prioritized novara et al 2021 a recent meta analysis systematically reviewed the efficiency of swcps in the red soil hilly region of china chen et al 2020 hedgerows were among the most effective biological measures for runoff reduction and contour tillage and ridge tillage reduced runoff by 55 and 39 respectively with respect to reduction of soil erosion the combination of hedgerows and contour tillage performed well with an efficiency greater than 92 but ridge tillage and contour tillage indicated relatively low reductions in soil loss of 54 and 56 respectively chen et al 2020 research based evidence on the effects of swcps on soil erosion control is vital in helping determine whether to adopt the practices or design alternative land management strategies although mechanic vegetative and agronomic swcps played a vital role in reducing soil erosion and enhancing sustainable land management individually their integration combination is more effective cerdà et al 2018 mekonnen et al 2017 and worthy of further study moreover the impact of swcps is long term not short term hence studies that assess effectiveness of swcps over time are needed keesstra et al 2019 which would help to achieve the united nations sustainable development goals and to deal with the land degradation neutrality challenges keesstra et al 2018 it is also a question as to whether economic benefits can be gained from ecological restorations using swcps to better determine if a win win of socioeconomic development and ecological reconstruction can be advocated to achieve sustainable land management chen et al 2020 5 conclusions this study identified optimal ridge practices under different rainfall types on surface runoff and soil loss from sloping farmland in the red soil region of southern china water induced erosion from newly tilled farmland was severe and lasted a longer time the selected ridge practices played a role in intercepting runoff and soil loss reducing annual runoff depth by 18 9 62 0 and annual soil loss by 68 9 86 3 when compared to bare flat land we found that the vast majority of runoff 68 89 and sediment 95 98 production during the seven year study was due to a few 20 rainfall events mainly belong to rainfall type iii the highest intensity shortest duration and highest frequency and rainfall type ii moderate depth moderate duration and moderate intensity effects of rainfall variables on runoff depth and soil loss varied among different rainfall types rainfall depth plays a dominant role in runoff generation and runoff depth is the main factor that influences soil loss the control modes of downslope ridges with hedgerow intercropping and contour ridges were better than downslope ridge modes under different rainfall conditions we also suggest that more attention should be paid to managing the impacts of rainfall events of long duration but low intensity and high precipitation on farmlands with only downslope ridges these results can provide a reference for planning tillage practices for

10018,the relationship between different rainfall types different soil management practices and soil erosion is not yet fully understood in situ observations of soil and water loss on sloping farmland in the red soil region of southern china with a subtropical monsoon environment were taken at 12 runoff plots with four treatments i e downslope ridges downslope ridges with hedgerow intercropping contour ridges and bare flat land as control over a seven year period from 2012 to 2018 during this time 253 natural rainfall events were classified into three rainfall types by k means clustering according to the rainfall depth maximum 30 min rainfall intensity and rainfall duration and surface runoff and soil erosion processes in relation to the rainfall types under different ridge practices were analyzed the results show that water induced soil erosion on the flat land control was significant with average annual soil loss of 76 73 t ha 1 yr 1 reaching the intense erosion classification and ridge practices were confirmed to reduce annual runoff and soil loss in all rainfall events by 18 9 62 0 and 68 9 86 3 respectively on the whole rainfall events can be divided into three types intense normal and long duration among them intense and normal rainfall cause the majority of soil 88 5 93 7 and water 75 0 83 8 loss in this area but the efficiencies in runoff and soil reduction during long duration rainfall events were the lowest or even negative on farmlands with only downslope ridges 20 of the total rainfall events in which 84 3 92 2 were intense and normal rainfall events contributed to 29 33 of the total rainfall depth 68 89 of the total runoff depth and 94 98 of the total soil loss rainfall depth played a dominant role in generating runoff while runoff accumulation was a main factor influencing on soil loss findings from our study indicate that by choosing a more appropriate ridge practice according to different rainfall types there can be a positive effect on

region has been facing severe soil and water loss barton et al 2004 fang et al 2017 according to liang et al 2010 and zheng et al 2021 sloping farmland is the primary source of soil erosion and the rate of soil loss can reach 98 78 t ha 1 yr 1 in the red soil region currently research examining soil erosion and suitable control measures for sloping farmland have been successfully undertaken in the region shi et al 2014 yang et al 2013 fang et al 2017 dai et al 2018 however due to obvious differences in topography soil types crop types and farming habits in different study areas findings from previous investigations report different results and long term field observation experiments are still insufficient soil erosion processes on sloping farmland are affected by different ridge practices that change the surface micro topography at present research findings about the effect of surface morphology on erosion process are basically consistent the surface morphology intercepts rainwater through the hollows changing the source and sink processes and the paths by which water is gathered and dispersed in turn affecting the surface runoff and soil loss appels et al 2016 furthermore compared with flat terrain concave terrain makes the surface runoff and sediment generation process have a more obvious boundary effect the greater the undulation and roughness of the surfaces the more significant the time delays of surface runoff and sediment generation zhao et al 2018 many studies have shown that by applying ridge practices on sloping farmland e g ridge hayrick field tied ridges and downslope ridges plus contour hedgerows soil erosion is significantly reduced ngetich et al 2014 xie et al 2015 grum et al 2017 yang et al 2013 dai et al 2018 for example grum et al 2017 carried out field experiments during the rainy seasons in arid and semi arid environments and showed that tied ridges significantly reduced runoff by 56 and improved soil moisture content compared with normal agricultural practices without ridge treatments ngetich et al 2014 reported that tied ridging was the most efficient measure among selected tillage practices in reducing runoff and sediment yield in semi arid regions compared with flat tillage ridge tillage is widely used in the red soil region of southern china with humid subtropical environments where the alternation of dry and wet soil is frequent and can improve the temperature light water and fertilizer conditions during crop growth however poorly chosen ridging practices are an important cause of high surface runoff and soil erosion even with maximum vegetation coverage of 80 poor choices in ridging can still cause serious soil erosion liang et al 2010 a comparison between different ridge management strategies on sloping farmland need to be examined in order to determine best practices for reducing erosion and runoff damage rainfall is another primary factor influencing runoff generation and soil erosion truman et al 2007 girmay et al 2009 huo et al 2020 the impacts of rainfall characteristics e g rainfall intensity duration depth and type on runoff and soil erosion have been and continue to be extensively studied de lima et al 2003 kinnell 2005 dos santos et al 2017 chen et al 2018 among important rainfall characteristics rainfall type is the complex primary factor influencing hydrological and erosion processes ran et al 2012 results from past studies show that due to differences in climate rainfall in different regions is classified differently and has unique relationships with soil erosion the significant relationship between rainfall runoff erosion processes is also significantly impacted by management practices mchugh et al 2007 dagnew et al 2015 at present the classification of rainfall types for the study of soil erosion laws in china is mostly found in the northwest loess plateau which has a semi arid environment wei et al 2007 2014 ran et al 2012 fang et al 2008 the rainfall in the loess plateau can be divided into three regimes short duration and high intensity rainfall medium duration and medium intensity rainfall and long duration and low intensity rainfall among them short duration and high intensity rainfall is the main cause of soil erosion in this area the red soil region of southern china experiences a humid environment with annual average rainfall between 1200 and 2000 mm and has the greatest rainfall erosivity in china but there are few detailed studies about the effect of rainfall types on soil and water loss zhang et al 2011 qin et al 2015 for example huang et al 2010 used the rapid clustering method to divide erosive rainfall into four types and selected three of those types to compare the runoff and sediment yield changes of different vegetation restoration models another example of relevant research is that liu et al 2016 classified 393 rainfall events into five regimes by the k means clustering method and analyzed surface runoff subsurface flow and sediment loss processes in relation to the rainfall regimes under three land cover types as previously stated the red soil region in southern china has the highest rate of rainfall induced erosion in the country and the management practices used on the sloping farmland are diverse the relationship between different rainfall types different soil management measures and soil erosion remains unclear the goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of various ridge practices and rainfall types on surface runoff and soil loss on sloping red soil farmland with a humid subtropical environment in southern china the specific objectives were 1 to compare the differences in surface runoff and soil loss under different ridge practices 2 to determine the responses of surface runoff and soil loss under different rainfall types and 3 to study the role of different ridge practices on soil erosion control under different rainfall types findings from this study could ultimately lead to a better management of agricultural systems in the red soil region of southern china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was carried out at the jiangxi ecological park of soil and water conservation in the yangou watershed 115 42 38 115 43 06 e 29 16 37 29 17 40 n de an county jiangxi province china the study area was 15 km away from poyang lake which is the biggest freshwater lake in china the area has a subtropical monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature of 16 9 and a mean annual frost free period of 249 d mean annual precipitation in this area is 1449 mm with precipitation between april and september accounting for about 70 of the total annual precipitation the topography is generally characterized by low hills with elevations of 30 100 m the slopes across the area range from 5 to 25 this watershed belongs to the typical plain landform of a lake area with a concentrated distribution of sloping farmland crop rotations of winter rapeseed brassica napus and summer peanut arachis hypogaea l account for the use of the sloping farmland the soil dominated by a red soil developed from quaternary red clay is acidic to slightly acidic according to the u s soil taxonomy the dominant soil is generally classified as ultisol the total organic matter total nitrogen total phosphorus and total potassium contents of the tested soil 0 20 cm are 2 32 0 24 0 25 and 12 53 g kg 1 respectively its clay silt and sand contents are 46 85 47 39 and 5 76 respectively zheng et al 2021 natural resources and land use types in the yangou watershed are typical of the red soil region in southern china 2 2 experimental design and agricultural practices twelve in situ runoff plots were constructed on a waste grassland with a 10 gradient with similar soil conditions each plot was 20 m long 5 m wide and all plots were adjacent and parallel to the slope in order to retain external runoff each plot was surrounded by brick walls that were plastered with cement mortar these walls were inserted 30 cm into the ground and protruded 20 cm above the surface a rectangular drainage trough and a set of circular collecting buckets were installed on the lower slope of each plot to collect surface runoff and eroded sediment a water level gauge installed in each bucket was used to record the runoff volume for each rainfall event the construction of runoff plots was finished at the beginning of 2011 the twelve runoff plots were arranged in a randomized complete block design with the following treatments downslope ridge tillage dt downslope ridge tillage with hedgerows planted in contour dt hg contour ridge tillage ct and bare flat land as control ck fig 1 there were five planted ridges along the slope of each dt and dt hg plot and 20 planted ridges that contoured the slope of each ct plot each planted ridge was 70 cm wide 20 cm high and 200 cm long in each dt hg plot day lily hemerocallis citrina hedgerow was established every 5 m along the slope by transplanting seedlings on october 26 2011 day lily was planted in two rows at a spacing of 20 30 cm in each belt in order to reduce surface disturbance the hedge belts were maintained without tillage during the study period bare flat land was employed as the control treatment and the weeds in the runoff plots were manually removed every month according to local planting practices peanut summer and oil rapeseed winter were selected as crops for annual rotation peanut arachis hypogaea l was planted in each plot in late april and harvested in late august oil rapseed brassica napus was transplanted in late october and harvested in late april the ridge s surface was tilled in ridged plots and on the whole surface in ck plots soil was ploughed using a hoe to a depth of about 20 cm peanuts were sown at a density of about 100 000 holes per hectare with two seeds per hole and oil rapeseed was transplanted at a density of about 67 000 plants per hectare the cropping system and cultivation practices used were applied according to local typical agricultural management in the red soil region of southern china 2 3 in situ observations the observations of runoff and sediment under natural rainfall began in april 2011 to moderate the disturbances caused by plot construction surface runoff and sediment yield data runoff depth and soil loss used in this paper began in 2012 a rainfall event was not considered to be independent unless the rainfall interval was over 6 h renard et al 1997 surface runoff volume of each runoff event was calculated according to a pre determined water level volume ratio using the water level gauge installed in the runoff bucket after each rainfall event a runoff sample mixed with sediment was collected in an aluminum box and sediment concentration was determined by drying the sample in an oven to a constant weight at 105 c the sediment loss of each rainfall event was calculated by multiplying the runoff volume and sediment concentration notably if the drainage trough had accumulated bed load the dry weight of bed load was calculated after sampling and drying which was included in the total sediment loss of the erosive rain event precipitation was recorded using an automatic meteorological situated station 20 m from the experimental plots the start and end time of a rainfall event the rainfall intensity and the rainfall depth were recorded a total of 264 observations were recorded during the entire experiment among them 11 rainfall events were excluded from analysis as they occurred across holidays or festivals during which observations were not made consistently and were difficult to distinguish from independent erosive rainfall events 2 4 data processing in order to assess the effects of ridge practices and rainfall types surface runoff and sediment yield data runoff depth and soil loss were collected for 253 erosive rainfall events from 2012 to 2018 in this study k means clustering was used to classify rainfall types according to rainfall depth p maximum 30 min rainfall intensity i30 and rainfall duration d the classification met the anova criterion for significance p 0 05 runoff depth r and soil loss s were calculated using the following formulas 1 r q a 1000 where r was runoff depth mm q was the runoff volume m3 and a was the runoff plot area 100 m2 2 s e a 10 where s was soil loss t ha 1 and e was erosive sediment kg runoff and sediment reduction of ridge management were calculated according to the comprehensive control of soil and water conservation method of benefit calculation gb t 15774 2008 of china as 3 η r r 0 r m r 0 100 4 η s s 0 s m s 0 100 where η r and η s are runoff reduction and sediment reduction respectively r m and r 0 are the runoff depth of ridged management plots and bare control plots mm respectively s m and s 0 are the soil loss from ridged management plots and bare control plots t ha 1 respectively the kolmogorov smirnov test showed that the data were normally or log normally distributed the one way anova test was used to test for differences in surface runoff and sediment yield between different management types and rainfall types spearman correlation was used to illustrate the correlations between the runoff depth the soil loss and rainfall characteristics spss 17 0 was used to perform statistical analysis and originpro 2019b was used to draw charts 3 results 3 1 description of erosive rainfall events the 253 erosive rainfall events used in this study were divided into three groups by k means clustering based on the rainfall depth the maximum 30 min rainfall intensity and the rainfall duration table 1 rainfall type iii was characterized by intense rainfall with the shortest duration 325 min and the lowest rainfall depth 22 6 mm but the highest maximum 30 min rainfall intensity 22 7 mm h 1 rainfall type iii occurred 108 times which was the highest frequency of any rainfall type rainfall type i long duration rainfall included rainfall events that had the greatest depth 51 7 mm the longest duration 1888 min and the lowest maximum 30 min rainfall intensity 15 5 mm h 1 but also the lowest frequency with only 53 such events observed rainfall type ii characterized by normal rainfall had a moderate depth moderate duration and moderate maximum 30 min rainfall intensity this rainfall type occurred 92 times during the seven years considering seasonal distributions fig 2 rainfall type i mainly occurred in spring from march to may and autumn from september to november with the total occurrence of 31 times and 58 5 probability rainfall type ii mainly occurred in spring with the highest seasonal occurrence of 47 times and 51 1 probability and rainfall type iii occurred both in spring and summer from june to august with 46 and 45 times and probabilities of 42 6 and 41 7 respectively 3 2 runoff and soil loss under different ridge practices fig 3 presents the results of average annual runoff and soil loss from the four treatments from 2012 to 2018 it was clear that the runoff and soil loss were strongly affected by ridge practices runoff depth was the highest and the lowest in ck and ct with average annual amounts of 179 86 and 68 40 mm respectively the average annual runoff depth in dt and dt hg was 145 79 and 84 34 mm respectively runoff depth was significantly p 0 05 lower in ct and dt gh compared with ck and dt the highest average annual soil loss was found in ck 76 73 t ha 1 yr 1 which had the poorest surface cover conditions followed by dt 23 86 t ha 1 yr 1 the lowest average annual soil loss was found in ct and dt hg both with 10 49 t ha 1 yr 1 soil loss was significantly p 0 05 lower in all ridge treatments than from the bare flat control significant p 0 05 differences were also shown in the average annual soil loss between dt and dt hg ct 3 3 runoff and sediment loss from different rainfall types fig 4a shows that mean annual runoff depth for the ck treatment demonstrated a significant decreasing trend p 0 05 from rainfall type ii iii i rainfall types ii and iii created significantly p 0 05 more runoff depth than that created in rainfall type i for the dt and dt hg treatments rainfall type ii created significantly p 0 05 more runoff depth from ct treatments compared with rainfall type i as shown in fig 4b rainfall type iii had the highest soil erosion for all treatments with mean annual soil loss ranging from 5 02 to 43 33 t ha 1 yr 1 rainfall type i showed the lowest soil erosion for the four treatments with mean annual soil loss ranging from 0 66 to 6 33 t ha 1 yr 1 soil loss across the three rainfall types showed significant p 0 05 differences under the ck treatment soil loss in rainfall type i showed a significant p 0 05 difference from the other rainfall types for dt ct and dt hg treatments on the whole it can be concluded from fig 4 that intense rainfall type iii events caused more soil loss whereas normal rainfall type ii events generated more runoff on the sloping farmland 4 discussion 4 1 effects of ridge practices on water induced erosion water induced soil erosion is a serious issue in the red soil region of southern china liang et al 2010 zheng et al 2021 due to the increase in cultivated vegetation coverage using a peanut rape rotation compared to that of bare land runoff generation and soil loss were reduced by an average of more than 18 9 and 68 9 respectively during the seven years of the study fig 3 however due to poor choice of soil management practices implemented in cultivated areas there are serious risks of soil and water losses experimental results fig 5 showed that annual soil loss from cultivated farmland with a conventional downslope tillage in the first year reached 55 99 t ha 1 yr 1 reaching classification as intense erosion 50 80 t ha 1 yr 1 according to the standards for classification and gradation of soil erosion scgse issued by the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china as the years since the land was reclaimed increased soil loss from the sloping farmland decreased but due to disturbances in the crop rotations annual soil loss continued to be large above 15 t ha 1 yr 1 tu et al 2018 analyzed the erosion characteristics under an orchard planting mode in the same study area and found that soil erosion during the first year after planting was the largest however after the trees reached maturity soil erosion decreased and 64 of the study years recorded annual soil loss rate with a tolerance of 5 t ha 1 yr 1 this study showed that soil erosion from farmland was severe and that crop farmland experienced longer erosion times than the orchard farmland these were consistent with other research results wei et al 2007 determined that crop land experienced the highest surface runoff and soil erosion in the loess hilly areas of china far more than those in other land use types cropland is strongly affected by human caused disturbances which disturbs the soil layer and reduces land coverage bagarello and ferro 2010 keesstra et al 2016b reported that the highest runoff and erosion amounts were seen in uncovered plots and the lowest values were identified in covered plots shui et al 2001 found annual soil loss rate from sloped red soil farmland in the first two years after development reached above 50 t ha 1 yr 1 with higher losses from crops than orchards this was due to serious disturbances of the surface soil that caused loose soil early in the planting period and by the frequent tillage with crop rotation practices that increased soil erodibility and the probability of severe erosion during the growing season on the other hand frequent tillage and serious disturbances homogenized the soils and created nearly uniformly slope at the plot scale while surface runoff and wash was produced nearly everywhere cerdà and rodrigo comino 2020 when efficient prevention and control measures are removed increased flow and sediment connectivity can cause serious water and soil erosion along the slope rodrigo comino et al 2018 the spatially uniformly distributed flow generation and soil erosion in the plot implied that the current tillage was not sustainable due to the lack of sink areas able to reduce the runoff and sediment discharge in the humid area cerdà and rodrigo comino 2020 hence to better prevent and control soil erosion from sloped farming systems with crop rotation best soil management practices should be undertaken all the time ridge practices are effective in reducing water induced erosion on sloping farmland with rotating crops in this study on average ct and dt hg treatments significantly decreased annual runoff depth more than 53 1 and these two treatments decreased annual soil losses by 86 3 when compared with the control moreover after the fourth year of monitoring the amount of annual soil loss on farmland with ct and dt hg treatments was lower 0 30 4 46 t ha 1 yr 1 respectively than the tolerable erosion rate 5 t ha 1 yr 1 for this region fig 5 contour ridges across the slope can greatly reshape the slope and change the direction of water flow from downward to horizontal effectively slowing the flow velocity and increasing the probability of soil infiltration forming barriers that trap sediment in runoff water generally contour tillage has the most obvious effect on reducing runoff and soil losses in the early stage of rainfall or rainfall with light intensity yang et al 2013 dai et al 2018 in this study there was an average decrease of 62 0 of the annual runoff depth and 86 3 of the annual soil loss in ct plots compared with the control the reduction of runoff and soil by hedgerows could be attributed to the hedgerow bases and stems blocking the path and to the reconstruction of micro topography such as a shortening of the slope length and a reduction of the slope gradient blanco canqui et al 2004 sudhishri et al 2008 adhikary et al 2017 zheng et al 2021 there was an average decrease of annual runoff depth and soil loss of 53 1 and 86 3 in the dt hg treatment compared with the control it is noteworthy that the perennial hedgerow started to play a role in intercepting sediment in the year after planting and started to play a role in intercepting runoff during the second year fig 5 these findings are in agreement with former studies he et al 2016 and li et al 2019 also found that sediment reduction occurred one year earlier than runoff reduction for leucaena leucocephala hedgerow after planting on purple sloping farmland in southwest china zheng et al 2021 reported that hemerocallis citrina hedgerow did not play a role in intercepting surface runoff during the first year after planting while it did affect sediment in its first year after planting on sloping red soil farmland in southern china this is because the first year after planting is considered the adaptation period in which perennial hedgerows do not intercept runoff from slopes during the second year after planting the hedgerow begins to have a mechanical interception effect on runoff and sediment to enhance the runoff reduction effects of the hedgerow it should be combined with straw mulching or other methods in the early stages of hedgerow construction the least effective measure in reducing runoff and sediment loss was downslope ridge tillage figs 3 and 5 the reason for these phenomena was that the planting ridges were parallel to the slope surface which was conducive to runoff collection causing the greatest runoff and sediment yield in the dt plots the differences of flow and sediment connectivity among ct dt hg and dt resulted in different effects barriers and contour ridges formed on and across the slope disconnected the flow and sediment between rows in the early stage or light rainfall events and reduced the connectivity even in moderate or heavy rainfall events the hedgerow created a topographical barrier that contributed to low connectivity between the upper and lower hedgerows boundaries for most rainfall events as more years post planting passed hedgerow slope became less connected as more soil collected on their upper boundaries via splash processes and tillage erosion rodrigo comino et al 2018 during rare large storm events a connection occurred between the upper and lower hedgerow boundaries the greatest reduction effects still appeared in the dt hg treatment even though they had a downslope ridge the well connectivity on the slope using dt treatment increased the connectivity of flow and sediment and resulted in the least reduction runoff and soil erosion in general the higher the connectivity the worse the control effect on runoff and soil erosion at the plot scale to enhance the reduction of soil erosion and runoff these findings suggest that a combination of measures such as grass hedges and straw mulching jointly provided the greatest reduction of erosion and the least connectivity on sloping farmland with downslope tillage 4 2 response of erosion in red soil regions to different rainfall types the impacts of rainfall types on runoff and soil erosion have been extensively studied wei et al 2007 2014 fang et al 2008 huang et al 2010 ran et al 2012 qin et al 2015 liu et al 2016 chen et al 2018 compared with the existing classification results of erosive rainfall in the red soil region of southern china zhang et al 2011 classified five types of rainfall using a 10 mm rainfall equivalent interval this classification method represents the average segmentation of rainfall and does not reflect the influence of rainfall intensity and other characteristics huang et al 2010 used the rapid clustering method to classify four types of rainfall however from the results one type of rainfall only contained one event while the average rainfall duration and maximum 30 min rainfall intensity of the other three types of rainfall in decreasing order were type iii type ii type i this classification result does not reflect the characteristics of different rainfall indicators in a rainfall event in this study the rainfall events were divided into three types by the rapid clustering method table 1 the probability of d and p under the rainfall type clustering function significance test with probability p 0 0001 and i30 under the rainfall type clustering function significance test with probability p 0 05 resulted in a better clustering effect utilizing this method produced results that were more in line with the actual observed conditions in the red soil region of southern china many studies have shown that different rainfall types can generate various runoff and soil erosion conditions jiao et al 1999 wei et al 2009 qin et al 2015 liu et al 2016 duan et al 2020 in this study the mean amount of annual soil loss for all treatments in order of greatest to least was rainfall iii rainfall ii rainfall i fig 4 with percentages of 45 2 56 5 35 3 45 9 and 6 3 11 5 respectively rainfall iii with the highest maximum 30 min rainfall intensity mean i30 was 22 7 mm h 1 the shortest duration mean duration was 325 min and the highest frequency 108 times table 1 created the most soil loss on sloping farmland and should be the focus of future prevention methods this result was similar to results from previous studies in the same area qin et al 2015 liu et al 2016 liu et al 2016 also found that rainfall regime v with characteristically high intensity short duration and high frequency had the highest sensitivity in sediment yield in the red soil region rainfall iii events exceeded the soil infiltration capacity and the excess rainfall was lost as surface runoff wei et al 2014 moreover the raindrops associated with type iii events have high kinetic energy and can damage the soil structure when they hit the ground van dijk et al 2002 wang et al 2019 as a consequence the rainfall iii events were assumed to dominate soil loss when compared to other rainfall type events other researchers have reported similar results in different areas wei et al 2007 peng and wang 2012 dos santos et al 2017 for example in the northwest loess plateau of china storms with short duration were also the main rainfall type that caused soil erosion wei et al 2007 accounting for more than 60 of soil erosion jiao et al 1999 the rainfall depth of a short duration rainstorm is between 10 and 30 mm and lasts between 30 and 120 min in the northwest loess plateau jiao et al 1999 soil erosion in the two regions is mainly caused by storms of short duration and tends to have approximately the same rainfall depth but the rainfall duration in the loess plateau tends to be shorter and of greater intensity than in the red soil region many studies have shown that water erosion tends to be caused by a few rainfall events especially those that are extreme duan et al 2020 ai et al 2015 zhang et al 2011 huang et al 2010 in this seven year study 20 of the rainfall events contributed 29 33 of the rainfall depth 95 98 of the total sediment and 68 89 of the total runoff on sloping farmland fig 6 among the 20 rainfall events 51 rainfall events rainfall type iii accounted for about 60 in the ck treatment while rainfall iii and ii events accounted for 37 47 and 43 47 in other treatments respectively obviously the extreme rainfall in type iii and ii events played the destructive role in inducing surface runoff and soil erosion as shown in this study better performance of management measures could weaken the destructive impact of different rainfall types on water erosion liu et al 2016 wang et al 2019 fig 7 shows the reductions achieved in runoff and soil loss as a whole ridge treatments significantly reduced soil and water loss for all rainfall events compared with the control however the effectiveness in runoff and soil reduction of the ridge measures differed across the three types of rainfall figs 7 and 8 for all ridge measures rainfall iii intense rainfall events had the largest effect on runoff depth 34 7 67 9 and soil loss 75 1 88 5 while rainfall i long duration rainfall events had the least reduction effect on runoff generation 24 8 to 60 3 and sediment yield 56 6 89 5 it is worth noting that the rate of runoff and sediment reduction in the dt treatment was the lowest under the three rainfall types and even had a negative effect 24 8 on reducing runoff under rainfall type i in the future more attention should be paid to managing long duration but low intensity and high precipitation rainfall events on farmlands with downslope ridges alone ridge management reduced soil loss more than runoff under different rainfall types fig 7 the effect of rainfall type on runoff and soil loss is associated with rainfall variables such as depth intensity and duration rainfall depth and intensity were confirmed as the main drivers of runoff and soil loss ran et al 2012 qin et al 2015 liu et al 2016 nearing et al 2017 past studies have shown that rainfall intensity plays a dominant role in soil loss van dijk et al 2002 kinnell 2005 while rainfall depth is the main factor influencing runoff mayor et al 2007 ziadat and taimeh 2013 huo et al 2020 spearman correlation analysis table 2 shows the effects of rainfall variables on the runoff depth and the soil loss were different among different rainfall types for rainfall types i and ii the rainfall depth contributed more to both runoff depth and soil loss however for rainfall type iii the maximum 30 min rainfall intensity contributed more to soil loss than the rainfall depth and the rainfall depth often contributed more to runoff depth results confirmed that except for the ck treatment the rainfall depth contributed more to runoff generation than the maximum 30 min rainfall intensity for all rainfall events in similar area mayor et al 2007 ziadat and taimeh 2013 huo et al 2020 previous studies have shown that linear power or exponential correlations have been used to describe the relationships between rainfall runoff and soil loss kothyari et al 2004 qin et al 2015 dai et al 2018 huo et al 2020 in our study regression analysis showed that runoff was significant p 0 05 and positively correlated with rainfall depth for each treatment while soil loss was more related to runoff depth table 3 4 3 soil erosion control using different ridge practices and other swcps in addition to using different ridge practices other swcps with various anti erosion mechanisms have been recognized as being effective in reducing water induced erosion as mentioned above ridge practice forms both a high convex ridge and a low concave ridge which changes the micromorphology of the sloping land and affects runoff and sediment connectivity each ridge simultaneously contributes to retaining soil and water and increasing precipitation infiltration mulching can be used as a useful management practice to control soil erosion rates due to the immediate effect on reducing the high soil detachment rate and runoff initiation by mitigating raindrops splash erosion and by reducing runoff generation and especially sediment losses keesstra et al 2019 straw mulch is also effective in managing soil and water loss via protection against splash erosion dai et al 2018 found that in southern china mulch was most effective at controlling water erosion under heavy rainfall because it provided a buffer for rain drops and increased infiltration catch crops and cover crops have also been recognized as effective agronomic practices to promote soil conservation mainly by increasing vegetation cover and surface roughness rodrigo comino et al 2020 reported the use of vicia sativa as an effective soil erosion control measure during the first stages of vineyard plantations lópez vicente et al 2020 pointed that cover crops minimized soil loss in permanent cropping systems where the soil was usually bare due to intense tillage or overuse of herbicides terracing is a typical mechanical swcp that can reduce soil erosion on sloping farmland terraced farmland can shorten the slope length change the terrain retain runoff and reduce or prevent erosion han et al 2020 even suffered from embankment failure the erosion modulus of terraced land 94 90 t ha 1 yr 1 was still less than that of sloped cropland dominated by rill gully erosion 112 52 t ha 1 yr 1 in a northern rocky mountainous area of china han et al 2020 a better understanding of the effect of swcps on runoff and soil erosion control could be helpful in determining the timing and selection of management practices to be adopted in different regions a review conducted for vineyard and olive orchards in mediterranean areas emphasized how appropriate measures differed between various climates with different constrains and foci novara et al 2021 temporary cover crop was suggested for drier environments due to water constraints while permanent species with high ground cover were suggested for wetter environments with a high risk of soil erosion and high yield quality prioritized novara et al 2021 a recent meta analysis systematically reviewed the efficiency of swcps in the red soil hilly region of china chen et al 2020 hedgerows were among the most effective biological measures for runoff reduction and contour tillage and ridge tillage reduced runoff by 55 and 39 respectively with respect to reduction of soil erosion the combination of hedgerows and contour tillage performed well with an efficiency greater than 92 but ridge tillage and contour tillage indicated relatively low reductions in soil loss of 54 and 56 respectively chen et al 2020 research based evidence on the effects of swcps on soil erosion control is vital in helping determine whether to adopt the practices or design alternative land management strategies although mechanic vegetative and agronomic swcps played a vital role in reducing soil erosion and enhancing sustainable land management individually their integration combination is more effective cerdà et al 2018 mekonnen et al 2017 and worthy of further study moreover the impact of swcps is long term not short term hence studies that assess effectiveness of swcps over time are needed keesstra et al 2019 which would help to achieve the united nations sustainable development goals and to deal with the land degradation neutrality challenges keesstra et al 2018 it is also a question as to whether economic benefits can be gained from ecological restorations using swcps to better determine if a win win of socioeconomic development and ecological reconstruction can be advocated to achieve sustainable land management chen et al 2020 5 conclusions this study identified optimal ridge practices under different rainfall types on surface runoff and soil loss from sloping farmland in the red soil region of southern china water induced erosion from newly tilled farmland was severe and lasted a longer time the selected ridge practices played a role in intercepting runoff and soil loss reducing annual runoff depth by 18 9 62 0 and annual soil loss by 68 9 86 3 when compared to bare flat land we found that the vast majority of runoff 68 89 and sediment 95 98 production during the seven year study was due to a few 20 rainfall events mainly belong to rainfall type iii the highest intensity shortest duration and highest frequency and rainfall type ii moderate depth moderate duration and moderate intensity effects of rainfall variables on runoff depth and soil loss varied among different rainfall types rainfall depth plays a dominant role in runoff generation and runoff depth is the main factor that influences soil loss the control modes of downslope ridges with hedgerow intercropping and contour ridges were better than downslope ridge modes under different rainfall conditions we also suggest that more attention should be paid to managing the impacts of rainfall events of long duration but low intensity and high precipitation on farmlands with only downslope ridges these results can provide a reference for planning tillage practices for

10019,optimal allocation of irrigation water both spatially and temporally is a great challenge in arid and semi arid regions with limited water available for irrigation in this study a simulation based optimization model for spatiotemporal allocation of irrigation water in arid region was developed which integrated a distributed farmland water balance model for simulating hydrological processes in farmland and an optimization model to maximize irrigation and precipitation use efficiency ipue a typical arid region the middle reach of the heihe river basin in northwest china with a total farmland area of 2624 km2 was selected as the study area field experiment data in 2012 and 2013 were used to calibrate and validate the simulation model then the simulation based optimization model was used to optimize the spatial and temporal allocation of irrigation water under various scenarios results indicate that the model is applicable for reflecting the complexities of water consumption and irrigation water allocation in the study area the optimal irrigation water depths averaged for different farmland units are 326 mm 327 mm 471 mm and 495 mm for spring wheat barley vegetable and maize respectively after optimal allocation of irrigation water ipues can exceed 0 8 for all climate conditions and ipue in the wet year was lower than those in other circumstances because of higher precipitation in the wet year higher ipue can be achieved when the gross irrigation water are 1 72 1 90 and 1 97 billion m3 for the representative wet normal and dry years respectively the results can be used to guide irrigation water management by providing the information on when and how much to irrigate for each crop in different farmland units graphical abstract ga1 keywords spatiotemporal allocation irrigation water irrigation and precipitation use efficiency simulation optimization arid region 1 introduction agriculture is the largest consumer of the world s water resources using about 70 of total freshwater withdrawals pereira et al 2015 kang et al 2017 water available for irrigation in most arid and semiarid regions were limited and can hardly fulfill the irrigation water requirements moreover irrigation water shortage was expected to increase in the future due to the increasing water uses for domestic industrial ecological and environmental purposes akhtar et al 2013 unreasonable use or allocation of irrigation water resources would aggravate the shortage of water resources consequently efficient and optimized spatiotemporal allocation of irrigation water to improve irrigation water use efficiency was crucial for the sustainability of agricultural development in the arid and semi arid regions the optimal spatiotemporal allocation of irrigation water refers to the optimized allocation of limited available irrigation water resources both in time and space under specified constraints during the whole irrigation season in the study region to achieve pre determined objectives this could generally be solved by optimization models singh 2012 2014a yang et al 2015 ren et al 2017 yu and lu 2018 li et al 2019a 2020c optimization models refer to mathematical programming model with an objective function and several constraints where the objective such as crop yield benefit or crop water productivity can be generally described by an explicit function of decision variables such as irrigation date and amount and could be solved with appropriate mathematical programming algorithms mathematical programming algorithms including linear programming non linear programming dynamic programming quadratic programming were the most widely used methods employed in the optimization of irrigation water resources alaya et al 2003 georgakakos 2012 marques et al 2010 besides these traditional methods intelligent evolutionary algorithms such as genetic algorithm ga has also been widely used because more and more complicated issues are emerging in water resources allocation problems lin et al 2016 luo et al 2016 tayebiyan et al 2016 however the relationship between decision variables and the objective function was general very complex due to complicated processes of farmland water balance and crop growth and yield under different climate soil and irrigation conditions moreover irrigation schedules were usually simplified in temporal allocation where time step was generally set as a month or a crop growth stage and the changes of irrigation time in a time step were hardly reflected one of the major drawbacks of pure optimization models for the irrigation water allocation was the over simplification of the impact of irrigation schedules on crop et farmland water balance and crop growth and yield to address this issue simulation based optimization models for irrigation water allocation have been used in recent years which integrated the advantages of simulation models in describing the farmland hydrological processes and crop growth yield and optimization models to find the optimal solution shang and mao 2006 darshana et al 2012 garcía vila and fereres 2012 wen et al 2017 li et al 2018 however simulation based optimization models for irrigation water allocation were mainly used in the optimization of irrigation schedules singh 2014b 2014c jiang et al 2016 li et al 2019b 2020a and seldom in the regional allocation of irrigation water the distributed farmland water balance models for hydrological processes in farmland units were the base of simulation based optimization for spatiotemporal allocation of irrigation water in arid region the distributed farmland water balance model could reflect the spatial variations of soil crop and irrigation system of farmland units and could be integrated with optimization model to optimize the spatiotemporal allocation of irrigation water jiang et al 2015 li et al 2016 liu et al 2018 xu et al 2019 however most widely used distributed watershed hydrological models were focusing on simulating runoff processes most of which were mostly not suitable for hydrological simulation in the farmland of arid regions characterized by water diversion and distribution through canal system and crop water consumption the traditional runoff models should be modified or some new models should be developed for farmland hydrological simulations in arid regions hu et al 2004 tang et al 2004 zhao et al 2010 li et al 2017a 2017b therefore the main objective of this study was to develop a simulation based optimization model for spatiotemporal allocation of irrigation water in arid regions that maximized irrigation and precipitation use efficiency ipue the model integrated a distributed farmland water balance model for farmland and an optimization model to maximize ipue and was applied to allocate irrigation water both spatially and temporally in a typical arid agricultural region the middle reach of the heihe river basin major highlights of this study was using the distributed farmland water balance model as an implicit form of the objective function and integrated the simulation model with optimization algorithm to allocate irrigation water to farmland units with a daily time step 2 study area and data 2 1 the study area the average available water per unit area in the arid regions of northwest china was less than 6 of the china average value and agricultural water use accounted for approximately 88 of the total water uses the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2016 heihe river basin the second largest inland river basin of china and one of the leading food production regions in gansu province of northwest china was selected as a study area for the current study irrigation water use in the middle stream oasis of this basin accounted for over 90 of the total water use among which more than 80 was diverted from the heihe river xu et al 2019 to leave more water for downstream cropland and natural ecosystem the amount of water diverted from heihe river to the middle stream oasis should reduce by about 1 3 following the implementation of the water diversion plan in 2001 the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2001 which has caused a serious shortage of irrigation water therefore optimal spatiotemporal allocation of the limited irrigation water is crucial in irrigation water management there are seventeen irrigation districts in the middle reach of the heihe river basin fig 1 and table 1 this region is characterized by a temperate arid climate with the mean annual temperature ranging from 0 c to 5 c mean annual precipitation of 136 5 mm and mean annual potential evaporation of 1154 mm the groundwater table depth varied significantly from 3 m to 200 m the current study area covered all these seventeen irrigation districts with a total area of about 11 352 km2 which was comprised of approximately 23 2624 km2 farmland 2 forest and grassland 1 water surface and 74 bare soil most of the farmlands were cultivated with maize 48 spring wheat 1 barley 2 and commercial crops such as vegetables due to limited precipitation in the study area irrigation is essential for the cultivated lands where water is either diverted from the heihe river or pumped from the groundwater 2 2 data collection and field measurements data used in this study mainly included land use map irrigation data soil properties meteorological data and field observation data of soil water content the land use map with cropping pattern resolution 1 km 1 km fig 1 was provided by the environmental ecological science data center for west china the national natural science foundation of china http www heihedata org landscape units were divided into maize 1264 km2 wheat 19 km2 barley 42 km2 other crops mainly various kinds of vegetables 1298 km2 water surface 76 km2 forest 90 km2 grassland 96 km2 bare soil 8279 km2 and residential land 187 km2 fig 1 irrigation data from 2001 to 2010 including applied irrigation water depths for each crop gross water diverted for irrigation and canal system conveyance efficiency in each irrigation district were collected from zhangye statistics yearbook table 1 specifically the maximum irrigation water depths for maize wheat and other crops in the crop growth season were 790 mm 520 mm and 520 mm respectively the local irrigation times was four according to the field survey the annual amounts of irrigation water diverted from river or extracted from groundwater aquifer in the entire study area from 2000 to 2010 was 18 4 108 m3 to 22 8 108 m3 while that applied to the farmland were 11 9 108 m3 to 16 3 108 m3 during these eleven years the soil texture map of farmland in the study area was obtained from a field survey conducted in the year 2014 the soil samples in the study area were approximately evenly distributed with 5 km distance in farmland and collected at 134 points from the soil surface to a depth of 80 140 cm with an interval of 20 cm for particle size distribution and bulk density measurements the soil texture classification results can be found in fig 2 a and table 2 li et al 2020b meteorological data including precipitation relative humidity sunshine hours air temperature and wind speed for the period of 1963 2016 at zhangye meteorological station

reference evapotranspiration et0 calculated with the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 in the meteorological station are shown in fig 2 b field measurements for soil water content were conducted at 16 sampling points at maize fields in the yingke irrigation district from 2012 to 2013 fig 2 c jiang et al 2015 the soil water content from the surface to 140 cm deep soil layer was measured using the gravimetric sampling method with three replicates every 10 days during the crop growing period 3 simulation based optimization model for spatiotemporal allocation of irrigation water 3 1 framework for the simulation based optimization model the simulation based optimization model for irrigation water allocation consisted of two sub models a distributed farmland water balance model and an optimization model solved using a genetic algorithm fig 3 in the first part the simulation model was first calibrated and validated with the field measurements of soil water content and then applied to simulate the evapotranspiration for all farmland units and the whole study area for any specified meteorological conditions and water allocation schemes in the second part the genetic algorithm was used to find the optimal irrigation water allocation scheme to ensure that the ipue was close to 1 on the bases of the above simulation results 3 2 distributed farmland water balance model 3 2 1 division of simulation units each simulation units should have only one farmland environment with the same crop and soil texture with an irrigation district and the assemblage of individually homogeneous simulation analysis units should be regarded as a spatially heterogeneous area xue and ren 2017 in this study different simulation units were divided by considering spatial distributions of crop type soil texture and irrigation district fig 4 four crop types maize spring wheat barley and vegetable fig 4 a four soil types t1 t2 t3 and t4 fig 4 b and 17 irrigation districts figs 1 and 4 c are considered in this study for details the spatial distributions of crop types soil types and irrigation districts were grouped into small units under the arcgis by its function union i e each unit had the same crop type and soil type within an irrigation district 351 simulation units were identified in the entire study area fig 4 d and the area of simulation units ranged from1 to 130 km2 3 2 2 soil water balance model in simulation unit of farmland the soil water balance was simulated in each farmland unit the water balance in the crop root zone for a farmland unit was described by li et al 2017a 1 δ w n t p n t i n t et n t qs n t δ t where subscript n and t represent the number of farmland units and days in the crop growing period respectively δw nt is

θ cn wilting soil water content θ wn and empirical coefficients a n and b n these parameters were mainly depended on soil types and were calibrated and validated using soil water content data measured in the yingke irrigation district for each soil type fig 2 c during field experiments over two years 2012 and 2013 for details the measured soil water content data in 2012 were used to calibrate the model using the error and trial approach while the model was validated using the measured data in 2013 the model performance was evaluated using the normalized root mean square error nrmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the coefficient of determination r 2 these indices were calculated from 6 nrmse 100 o a v e 1 k k 1 k s k o k 2 7 nse 1 k 1 k s k o k 2 k 1 k o k o a v e 2 8 r 2 k 1 k s k

and s ave and o ave are the average values of the simulated and measured data respectively the simulation results were considered excellent when nrmse 10 good if 10 nrmse 20 acceptable if 20 nrmse 30 and poor if nrmse 30 ran et al 2017 2018 moreover if nse 0 5 the model simulation could be judged as satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 regarding the value of r 2 r 2 0 5 was considered acceptable legates and mccabe 1999 ran et al 2017 2018 the calibration procedure stopped when the indices mentioned above were all in acceptable ranges to further validate the model the final calibrated parameters were used to simulate the field soil water content processes in 2013 and the model performance during the validation period was also evaluated using the same statistical indices as the calibration period moriasi et al 2007 3 2 3 water balance in the whole study region the gross amount of water diverted from rivers and extracted from groundwater aquifer q m3 was distributed to the irrigation districts and farmland units through canal system net amount of irrigation water applied to irrigation district m was qi m m3 m 1 2 m the relationship of q qi m i n and a n were described as follows 9 q m 1 m q i m η m 10 m 1 m q i m n 1 n i n a n where m 17 is total number of irrigation districts in the study region η m is the canal efficiency of district m considering both diversion from river water and groundwater pumping table 1 moreover n 1 2 n where n 351 is the total number of farmland units in the study region i n and a n are irrigation water depth in the crop growth period m and area m2 of farmland unit n respectively considering that the maximum times of irrigation in a crop growth period was j 4 i n was calculated from the sum of net irrigation water depth in all irrigation applications which was 11 i n j 1 j i n j where i nj is the net irrigation water depth m for the jth application to farmaland unit n 3 3 optimization model for spatiotemporal irrigation water allocation in the arid regions water shortage was the controlling factor for agriculture production therefore more efficient use of the irrigation water and precipitation was the primary focus of agricultural water management irrigation and precipitation use efficiency in the farmland unit n ipue n and each irrigation district or the whole study region ipue were defined as 12 ipue n et n i n p n 13 ipue n 1 n et n a n n 1 n i n a n p n a n where et n and p n are total evapotranspiration m and total precipitation m in the crop growth period of unit n respectively et n was obtained by the sum of daily evapotranspiration et nt simulated by the soil water balance models eqs 1 5 for any given irrigation scheduling in addition to irrigation and precipitation soil water storage can also contribute to crop evapotranspiration consequently ipue might exceed 1 in cases with less irrigation and or higher initial soil water storage however over use of soil water storage was not sustainable to obtain higher ipue and avoid over use of soil water storage the squared difference of ipue to its ideal value of 1 was set as the objective function in this study 14 min z ipue 1 2 there were mainly three types of constraints for the optimization model 1 net irrigation water depth for each crop type should be in an appropriate range i e 15 i l min i l i l max l 1 2 3 4 where i l i lmin and i lmax are net irrigation water depth and the minimum and maximum irrigation water depths m for crop l in this study i lmin for all crops was set as zero and i lmax for maize spring wheat barley and other crops were set as 790 mm 520 mm 520 mm and 520 mm respectively 2 to improve the efficiency of optimization process irrigation interval constraints were added in this study for details the irrigation interval between two irrigation applications was smaller than the crop growth period divided by the maximum times of irrigation applications j i e 16 1 δ t n j t n j t n j t n j 1 δ t n j j 1 2 j where t n is the days of growing period for the crop in unit n d t nj is the date of the jth irrigation application of unit n t n0 0 δt nj is the irrigation interval between the j 1 th and jth irrigation applications 3 total net irrigation water constraints 17 q min m 1 m q i m q max where q min and q max are the minimal and maximal net irrigation water amount m3 in the optimization farmland units with the same crops and soil types were assumed to have the same irrigation scheduling therefore the decision variables were the irrigation dates t lsj and amounts i lsj of four applications for four crops and four soil types where l s j 1 2 3 4 represent the number of crops soil types and irrigation applications respectively consequently the total number of decision variables was 2 4 4 4 128 3 4 scenario design in this study two scenarios current situation and representative climate years were set to optimize irrigation water allocation the climate conditions from 2000 to 2010 were set as the current situation in this situation the canal efficiency of different irrigation districts and meteorological factors in each year were used to get the optimal irrigation water allocation strategy and the optimal results were compared with the present irrigation water allocation strategy three representative precipitation years including wet 75 normal 50 and dry 25 years were determined by an optimum curve fitting method of the frequency curve based on the historical precipitation data from 1963 to 2016 at zhangye meteorological station the canal efficiency for each irrigation district in 2010 was used during the simulation which ranged from 0 59 in banqiao to 0 79 in shahe irrigation district table 1 the gross irrigation constraints were set from 0 7 to 2 1 billion m3 while the net irrigation amount were from 0 5 to 1 5 billion m3 with 0 05 billion m3 interval for details we set the net irrigation amount in 21 intervals of 0 45 0 50 0 50 0 55 1 45 1 50 billion m3 each of which was used as the lower and upper limit of constraint q min and q max eq 17 to obtain the optimal irrigation water allocation strategy for different representative climate years data used in each scenario was listed in table 3 4 results 4 1 model calibration and validation the distributed farmland water balance model was calibrated with the maize field observations of average soil water content in 0 110 cm soil layer in 2012 and validated with observational data in 2013 comparisons of simulated and measured soil water content for model calibration and validation are shown in fig 5 and the calibrated parameters for different soil types are presented in table 4 results showed that the simulated values of soil water content were in agreement with the measured ones with nrmse ranging from 3 35 to 4 73 for calibration and from 3 97 to 6 5 for validation which indicated that the simulation results were excellent for nrmse ran et al 2017 2018 the nse values were ranging from 0 76 to 0 90 during the calibration period while from 0 55 to 0 86 during the model validation period which showed that the model simulation was satisfactory following the criterion of moriasi et al 2007 the determination coefficients r 2 showed a higher correlation values ranging from 0 76 to 0 90 between the simulated and measured values during both the calibration and validation periods overall the results showed good performance of the simulation model and indicated its capability of simulating the soil water content processes at farmland units in the study area since maize was the dominant crop covering an area of 48 in the study region field measurements and model calibration and validation were only performed in the maize field however model parameters related to soil properties table 4 were mainly influenced by soil texture and therefore they were also applicable to farmland units with different crops by considering the soil types crop parameters such as k c for different crops were obtained from available studies in the study area yin et al 2012 therefore the calibrated model was applicable to farmland units with different crops and soil types 4 2 optimal irrigation water allocation under current situations 4 2 1 irrigation scheduling water balance and ipue for different farmland units table 5 shows the optimal irrigation schedules for maize spring wheat barley and vegetable from 2000 to 2010 the table showed that 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th irrigation for maize should be applied before 45 days 85 days 117 days and 157 days after crop planting respectively optimal irrigation water depths for each irrigation application were in the range of 37 220 mm the optimized irrigation schedules in soil types t1 and t2 were similar where irrigation should be applied in around 18 45 days 38 85 days 77 117 days and 100 157 days with irrigation water depths from 57 to 173 mm 49 179 mm 42 181 mm and 48 194 mm respectively however the optimized irrigation schedules for maize in soil types t3 and t4 were more scattered compared with those in t1 and t2 further the 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th irrigation to spring wheat should be applied before 44 days 75 days 108 days and 124 days after crop planting the results of spring wheat for different soil types were similar in t1 and t2 and t3 and t4 soil types similarly the 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th irrigation for barley should be applied before 43 days 82 days 114 days and 147 days after the plantation moreover the 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th irrigation for vegetables should be applied before 45 days 75 days 113 days and 144 days after planting fig 6 shows the average values of water balance components from 2000 to 2010 for different farmland units before and after optimization at the present scenario without optimization evapotranspiration ranged from 420 mm to 619 mm while the irrigation water depth varied from 436 mm to 786 mm vegetable had the highest evapotranspiration among all other crops followed by maize on the other hand spring wheat and barley had the lowest evapotranspiration deep percolation played an important role in the water consumption by all crops which resulted in lower ipue the ipue of vegetables was higher than other crops due to its higher consumption rate moreover the evapotranspiration in t2 type soil was smaller than other soil types irrespective of crop types before optimization the evapotranspiration for different crops after optimization ranged from 419 mm to 610 mm with an average deep percolation of 27 mm after optimization the net irrigation water depth was 319 547 mm and ipue could be increased to almost 1 08 the optimal irrigation water depths were about 326 mm 327 mm 471 mm and 495 mm for spring wheat barley vegetable and maize respectively which resulted in an increased ipue close to 1 4 2 2 spatial distribution of ipue in the study area fig 7 depicts the distribution of major water balance components and ipue in 17 irrigation districts from 2000 to 2010 before optimization results showed that the average annual gross water diverted or pumped to the study area from 2000 to 2010 was about 21 1 108 m3 the average annual net irrigation water applied to farmland was 15 3 108 m3 and precipitation was 3 07 108 m3 youlian irrigation district with the maximum irrigated area received the most amount of irrigation water which was 2 81 108 m3 or 18 of the total irrigation water however the ipue in the youlian irrigation district was smaller 0 79 because about 24 of the irrigation water 6 8 107 m3 percolated to deeper soil layers the banqiao irrigation district had the lowest ipue of 0 71 while the luocheng irrigation district had the highest ipue of 1 09 fig 7 d fig 8 shows the average ipues in different irrigation districts from 2000 to 2010 after optimization and their improvement compared with the present condition it can be seen that all ipues in different irrigation districts were increased to more than 0 93 after optimization which meant that most of the irrigation water and local precipitation was used for crop water evapotranspiration except the luocheng irrigation district ipue in all other irrigation districts was improved after optimization maximum increase 0 3 in ipue was observed in banqiao irrigation district which resulted in 4 56 107 m3 37 reduction in irrigation water on the other hand ipue in luocheng irrigation district was decreased by 0 08 because ipue in luocheng irrigation district was 1 09 higher than the ideal value of 1 before optimization after optimization water allocated to this district was increased considering the total ipue for the whole study area the average annual gross irrigation water used in the entire study area for the period 2000 2010 would decrease from 21 1 108 m3 to 16 8 108 m3 due to irrigation water optimization in other words spatiotemporal optimization of irrigation water could save 20 of the irrigation water in the study area with more efficient use of irrigation water 4 2 3 annual water balance and ipue of the study area fig 9 shows the annual water balance of the study area from 2000 to 2010 it can be seen that evapotranspiration was the major component of water consumption which accounted for 76 96 of the total water consumption before optimization and 83 99 after optimization the evapotranspiration before and after optimization was ranging from 14 4 108 m3 to 16 7 108 m3 and 14 5 108 m3 to 15 6 108 m3 respectively moreover evapotranspiration was highest in 2004 and lowest in 2002 during the study period which was caused by the higher or lower reference evapotranspiration in these two years respectively irrigation was the primary source of water supply for farmland evapotranspiration which accounted for 68 95 of the total water supply before optimization and 65 83 after optimization the amount of water allocated to the farmland ranged from 11 9 108 m3 to 16 3 108 m3 before optimization which decreased to 10 5 108 13 5 108 m3 after the optimization it indicated that 1 4 108 m3 to 2 8 108 m3 net irrigation water can be saved in the entire study area using the optimal allocation scheme in other words 12 17 of net irrigation water can be saved due to optimization the ipue before optimization ranged from 0 73 to 0 98 while it ranged from 0 95 to 1 01 after optimization the optimized irrigation scheme increased the ipue by 0 02 0 23 or 2 31 compared with the present scenario these results agreed with zhou et al 2014 which confirmed that the ipue would increase by 9 after reasonably allocating the water resources in the same study area it can be concluded from these results that the ipue can generally be improved significantly through the appropriate spatiotemporal allocation of irrigation water 4 3 optimal irrigation water allocation in different climate years 4 3 1 water balance and ipue for the whole study area under different net irrigation amounts results of annual water balance and ipue for different net irrigation amounts under optimal irrigation water allocation in different climate years are presented in fig 10 it can be seen that ipue decreased with the net irrigation water amount under all the climate conditions which indicated that the proportion of irrigation water consumed for evapotranspiration decreased with the increasing of irrigation ipue under a wet year was lower than other climate years which was caused by more precipitation in the wet year and similar evapotranspiration for different climate years after optimization result also showed that ipues were all above 0 8 for all the climate conditions after optimization among the water balance components evapotranspiration was the highest water consumer while irrigation and precipitation were the main sources of water supply in cases with insufficient irrigation water supplied to the farmland water stored in the soil layer was consumed by evapotranspiration and the ipue was higher than 1 ipues were approximately 1 when the net irrigation water amounts of 12 5 108 m3 13 7 108 m3 14 2 108 m3 in wet normal and dry years respectively and the corresponding gross irrigation water amounts were 17 2 108 m3 18 9 108 m3 and 19 7 108 m3 respectively in this case almost all irrigation water and precipitation were used by evapotranspiration which was taken as ideal water amounts for different years with more irrigation water applied to farmland the soil water storage in the crop root zone increased slightly and the ipues reduced to less than 1 4 3 2 temporal allocation of irrigation water fig 11 showed the monthly gross irrigation water allocated to different irrigation districts under the ideal water amounts for different climate years results showed that most of the irrigation water should be allocated to irrigation districts in may and july under wet and normal years the amounts of irrigation water allocated in these two months accounted for 63 and 74 of total irrigation water in the wet and normal years respectively however in the dry year july was the peak month of irrigation for all the irrigation districts and the percentage of irrigation water in july was 38 of the total the amount of irrigation water allocated to irrigation districts in the other three months april may and june were similar which were all approximately 18 of the total in each month for a dry year the difference in optimal irrigation scheduling in different climate years was mainly caused by the temporal distributions of precipitation in different climate years and crop distribution precipitation in august was higher than other months which resulted in less irrigation requirements in addition spring wheat and barley were both harvested in august which resulted in no irrigation requirement for wheat and barley fields this result also demonstrated the superiority of the simulation based optimization method for spatiotemporal allocation of irrigation water because the simulation model could reflect the impact of climate variations and depicted the soil water balance in different farmlands the total gross irrigation water allocated to different irrigation districts is presented in table 6 4 3 3 spatial allocation of irrigation water fig 12 depicts the distribution of irrigation water depth amount and ipue for different farmland units and irrigation districts the results showed that irrigation water allocated to different farmland units in normal and dry years were higher than those in the wet year precipitation amount in the wet year was much higher than that in a normal or dry year therefore the optimal irrigation water allocated to different farmland units in the wet year was the lowest the irrigation water depth in the southeastern part was much higher than the other parts of the study area because most of the crops with higher water consumption were planted in this area ipue for different farmland units ranged from 0 92 to 1 23 for different irrigation districts irrigation water allocations were more in the middle strip than other districts because most of the farmland was located along the heihe river 5 discussion after optimal spatial temporal allocation of irrigation water evapotranspiration for different crops would be slightly smaller than those before optimization while the average deep percolation would be decreased dramatically under current situation fig 6 meanwhile the net irrigation water depth would be decreased significantly for details the net irrigation water depths of maize spring wheat and barley would be decreased considerably by 0 05 45 as compared with those before optimization while that of vegetation would be decreased slightly demonstrated that spring wheat and barley had the highest water saving potential than other crops similar results of optimal irrigation water depths were obtained in other studies in the same study area for example jiang et al 2016 obtained the optimal irrigation water depths of 450 592 mm for maize and 250 379 mm for wheat to obtain the maximum total benefit in the yingke irrigation district which were consistent with our results 495 mm for maize and 326 mm for spring wheat the distribution of evapotranspiration was related to the vegetables cultivation because of the higher evapotranspiration of vegetables for examples evapotranspiration in the northwest part youlian irrigation district was higher than other parts fig 7 which was due to its concentrated distribution of vegetables while in the southern part huazhaizi irrigation district where mostly spring wheat and barley crops were cultivated evapotranspiration was lower moreover the irrigation districts close to the heihe river had higher evapotranspiration rates on account of its favorable condition for water diversion as compared to other irrigation districts the farmland area in irrigation districts around the heihe river was also much higher than other districts for the luocheng irrigation district located in the lower middle reach of the heihe river basin with abundant land resources and scarce water resources it had less cultivated land and smaller evapotranspiration amount as compared with other irrigation districts in general irrigation districts in the upper part or close to the heihe river had better irrigation conditions and smaller ipue and vice versa therefore it was necessary to improve the irrigation water allocation strategies to increase the impartiality of irrigation water allocation and the ipue in the whole study area results of optimal spatial allocation of irrigation water under different climate years table 6 showed that irrigation water requirements were the highest in a dry year moderate in the normal year and lowest in the wet year amounts of irrigation water allocated to different irrigation districts were firstly determined by the irrigated area where the two largest irrigation districts xijun and youlian received the most amount of irrigation water in different climate years while the smallest irrigation district huazhaizi received the least amount of irrigation water in all three climate years besides the amount of allocated irrigation water was also influenced by crop planting patterns and irrigation districts with more fractions of high water demand crops such as vegetables generally received more water per unit irrigated area for example although the irrigated area of the youlian irrigation district was smaller than the xijun irrigation district a higher percentage of vegetables in youlian resulted in more allocated irrigation water in wet and normal years ipue of different farmland units depended on the climate condition and applied irrigation water depth fig 12 ipue was higher in the dry year as compared to the other years because precipitation was much smaller in a dry year and irrigation water was used more effectively to compensate for the evapotranspiration meanwhile ipue was generally smaller in districts with more allocated irrigation water after the optimization of irrigation water allocation ipue would be higher than 0 92 for all the climate conditions therefore the distributed simulation based optimization model developed in this study can be recommended as an efficient tool to optimize the irrigation water allocation under various scenarios both on spatial and temporal scales in arid regions 6 conclusions to allocate limited irrigation water resources in arid and semi arid regions a distributed farmland water balance model based optimization model is developed in this study to maximize the irrigation and precipitation use efficiency ipue in arid region the model is applied to the middle reach of heihe river basin to optimize the irrigation water allocation in both time and space under various scenarios the optimal irrigation water depth for the crops in the study area ranged from 319 mm to 547 mm about 20 of irrigation water can be saved annually in the entire study area if the irrigation water allocation was optimized during the period 2000 2010 after irrigation water allocation ipue could be reached higher than 0 92 for all the climate conditions to achieve an ideal ipue of 1 gross irrigation water amounts of 17 2 108 m3 18 9 108 m3 and 19 7 108 m3 were required for the wet year normal year and dry year respectively the optimized irrigation allocation scheme could ensure that almost all the precipitation and irrigation were consumed by the crops based on their requirement and provided a scientific basis for decision makers to allocate the irrigation water resources more efficiently it should be noted that the distributed simulation based optimization model developed in this study was applicable for addressing irrigation water allocation problems in arid regions some constraints were specific to the arid study area and some of them should be reconsidered when using this model to another study region besides this work was conducted with limited available data in order to obtain more accurate optimal spatial temporal irrigation water allocation results more detailed

10019,optimal allocation of irrigation water both spatially and temporally is a great challenge in arid and semi arid regions with limited water available for irrigation in this study a simulation based optimization model for spatiotemporal allocation of irrigation water in arid region was developed which integrated a distributed farmland water balance model for simulating hydrological processes in farmland and an optimization model to maximize irrigation and precipitation use efficiency ipue a typical arid region the middle reach of the heihe river basin in northwest china with a total farmland area of 2624 km2 was selected as the study area field experiment data in 2012 and 2013 were used to calibrate and validate the simulation model then the simulation based optimization model was used to optimize the spatial and temporal allocation of irrigation water under various scenarios results indicate that the model is applicable for reflecting the complexities of water consumption and irrigation water allocation in the study area the optimal irrigation water depths averaged for different farmland units are 326 mm 327 mm 471 mm and 495 mm for spring wheat barley vegetable and maize respectively after optimal allocation of irrigation water ipues can exceed 0 8 for all climate conditions and ipue in the wet year was lower than those in other circumstances because of higher precipitation in the wet year higher ipue can be achieved when the gross irrigation water are 1 72 1 90 and 1 97 billion m3 for the representative wet normal and dry years respectively the results can be used to guide irrigation water management by providing the information on when and how much to irrigate for each crop in different farmland units graphical abstract ga1 keywords spatiotemporal allocation irrigation water irrigation and precipitation use efficiency simulation optimization arid region 1 introduction agriculture is the largest consumer of the world s water resources using about 70 of total freshwater withdrawals pereira et al 2015 kang et al 2017 water available for irrigation in most arid and semiarid regions were limited and can hardly fulfill the irrigation water requirements moreover irrigation water shortage was expected to increase in the future due to the increasing water uses for domestic industrial ecological and environmental purposes akhtar et al 2013 unreasonable use or allocation of irrigation water resources would aggravate the shortage of water resources consequently efficient and optimized spatiotemporal allocation of irrigation water to improve irrigation water use efficiency was crucial for the sustainability of agricultural development in the arid and semi arid regions the optimal spatiotemporal allocation of irrigation water refers to the optimized allocation of limited available irrigation water resources both in time and space under specified constraints during the whole irrigation season in the study region to achieve pre determined objectives this could generally be solved by optimization models singh 2012 2014a yang et al 2015 ren et al 2017 yu and lu 2018 li et al 2019a 2020c optimization models refer to mathematical programming model with an objective function and several constraints where the objective such as crop yield benefit or crop water productivity can be generally described by an explicit function of decision variables such as irrigation date and amount and could be solved with appropriate mathematical programming algorithms mathematical programming algorithms including linear programming non linear programming dynamic programming quadratic programming were the most widely used methods employed in the optimization of irrigation water resources alaya et al 2003 georgakakos 2012 marques et al 2010 besides these traditional methods intelligent evolutionary algorithms such as genetic algorithm ga has also been widely used because more and more complicated issues are emerging in water resources allocation problems lin et al 2016 luo et al 2016 tayebiyan et al 2016 however the relationship between decision variables and the objective function was general very complex due to complicated processes of farmland water balance and crop growth and yield under different climate soil and irrigation conditions moreover irrigation schedules were usually simplified in temporal allocation where time step was generally set as a month or a crop growth stage and the changes of irrigation time in a time step were hardly reflected one of the major drawbacks of pure optimization models for the irrigation water allocation was the over simplification of the impact of irrigation schedules on crop et farmland water balance and crop growth and yield to address this issue simulation based optimization models for irrigation water allocation have been used in recent years which integrated the advantages of simulation models in describing the farmland hydrological processes and crop growth yield and optimization models to find the optimal solution shang and mao 2006 darshana et al 2012 garcía vila and fereres 2012 wen et al 2017 li et al 2018 however simulation based optimization models for irrigation water allocation were mainly used in the optimization of irrigation schedules singh 2014b 2014c jiang et al 2016 li et al 2019b 2020a and seldom in the regional allocation of irrigation water the distributed farmland water balance models for hydrological processes in farmland units were the base of simulation based optimization for spatiotemporal allocation of irrigation water in arid region the distributed farmland water balance model could reflect the spatial variations of soil crop and irrigation system of farmland units and could be integrated with optimization model to optimize the spatiotemporal allocation of irrigation water jiang et al 2015 li et al 2016 liu et al 2018 xu et al 2019 however most widely used distributed watershed hydrological models were focusing on simulating runoff processes most of which were mostly not suitable for hydrological simulation in the farmland of arid regions characterized by water diversion and distribution through canal system and crop water consumption the traditional runoff models should be modified or some new models should be developed for farmland hydrological simulations in arid regions hu et al 2004 tang et al 2004 zhao et al 2010 li et al 2017a 2017b therefore the main objective of this study was to develop a simulation based optimization model for spatiotemporal allocation of irrigation water in arid regions that maximized irrigation and precipitation use efficiency ipue the model integrated a distributed farmland water balance model for farmland and an optimization model to maximize ipue and was applied to allocate irrigation water both spatially and temporally in a typical arid agricultural region the middle reach of the heihe river basin major highlights of this study was using the distributed farmland water balance model as an implicit form of the objective function and integrated the simulation model with optimization algorithm to allocate irrigation water to farmland units with a daily time step 2 study area and data 2 1 the study area the average available water per unit area in the arid regions of northwest china was less than 6 of the china average value and agricultural water use accounted for approximately 88 of the total water uses the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2016 heihe river basin the second largest inland river basin of china and one of the leading food production regions in gansu province of northwest china was selected as a study area for the current study irrigation water use in the middle stream oasis of this basin accounted for over 90 of the total water use among which more than 80 was diverted from the heihe river xu et al 2019 to leave more water for downstream cropland and natural ecosystem the amount of water diverted from heihe river to the middle stream oasis should reduce by about 1 3 following the implementation of the water diversion plan in 2001 the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2001 which has caused a serious shortage of irrigation water therefore optimal spatiotemporal allocation of the limited irrigation water is crucial in irrigation water management there are seventeen irrigation districts in the middle reach of the heihe river basin fig 1 and table 1 this region is characterized by a temperate arid climate with the mean annual temperature ranging from 0 c to 5 c mean annual precipitation of 136 5 mm and mean annual potential evaporation of 1154 mm the groundwater table depth varied significantly from 3 m to 200 m the current study area covered all these seventeen irrigation districts with a total area of about 11 352 km2 which was comprised of approximately 23 2624 km2 farmland 2 forest and grassland 1 water surface and 74 bare soil most of the farmlands were cultivated with maize 48 spring wheat 1 barley 2 and commercial crops such as vegetables due to limited precipitation in the study area irrigation is essential for the cultivated lands where water is either diverted from the heihe river or pumped from the groundwater 2 2 data collection and field measurements data used in this study mainly included land use map irrigation data soil properties meteorological data and field observation data of soil water content the land use map with cropping pattern resolution 1 km 1 km fig 1 was provided by the environmental ecological science data center for west china the national natural science foundation of china http www heihedata org landscape units were divided into maize 1264 km2 wheat 19 km2 barley 42 km2 other crops mainly various kinds of vegetables 1298 km2 water surface 76 km2 forest 90 km2 grassland 96 km2 bare soil 8279 km2 and residential land 187 km2 fig 1 irrigation data from 2001 to 2010 including applied irrigation water depths for each crop gross water diverted for irrigation and canal system conveyance efficiency in each irrigation district were collected from zhangye statistics yearbook table 1 specifically the maximum irrigation water depths for maize wheat and other crops in the crop growth season were 790 mm 520 mm and 520 mm respectively the local irrigation times was four according to the field survey the annual amounts of irrigation water diverted from river or extracted from groundwater aquifer in the entire study area from 2000 to 2010 was 18 4 108 m3 to 22 8 108 m3 while that applied to the farmland were 11 9 108 m3 to 16 3 108 m3 during these eleven years the soil texture map of farmland in the study area was obtained from a field survey conducted in the year 2014 the soil samples in the study area were approximately evenly distributed with 5 km distance in farmland and collected at 134 points from the soil surface to a depth of 80 140 cm with an interval of 20 cm for particle size distribution and bulk density measurements the soil texture classification results can be found in fig 2 a and table 2 li et al 2020b meteorological data including precipitation relative humidity sunshine hours air temperature and wind speed for the period of 1963 2016 at zhangye meteorological station

reference evapotranspiration et0 calculated with the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 in the meteorological station are shown in fig 2 b field measurements for soil water content were conducted at 16 sampling points at maize fields in the yingke irrigation district from 2012 to 2013 fig 2 c jiang et al 2015 the soil water content from the surface to 140 cm deep soil layer was measured using the gravimetric sampling method with three replicates every 10 days during the crop growing period 3 simulation based optimization model for spatiotemporal allocation of irrigation water 3 1 framework for the simulation based optimization model the simulation based optimization model for irrigation water allocation consisted of two sub models a distributed farmland water balance model and an optimization model solved using a genetic algorithm fig 3 in the first part the simulation model was first calibrated and validated with the field measurements of soil water content and then applied to simulate the evapotranspiration for all farmland units and the whole study area for any specified meteorological conditions and water allocation schemes in the second part the genetic algorithm was used to find the optimal irrigation water allocation scheme to ensure that the ipue was close to 1 on the bases of the above simulation results 3 2 distributed farmland water balance model 3 2 1 division of simulation units each simulation units should have only one farmland environment with the same crop and soil texture with an irrigation district and the assemblage of individually homogeneous simulation analysis units should be regarded as a spatially heterogeneous area xue and ren 2017 in this study different simulation units were divided by considering spatial distributions of crop type soil texture and irrigation district fig 4 four crop types maize spring wheat barley and vegetable fig 4 a four soil types t1 t2 t3 and t4 fig 4 b and 17 irrigation districts figs 1 and 4 c are considered in this study for details the spatial distributions of crop types soil types and irrigation districts were grouped into small units under the arcgis by its function union i e each unit had the same crop type and soil type within an irrigation district 351 simulation units were identified in the entire study area fig 4 d and the area of simulation units ranged from1 to 130 km2 3 2 2 soil water balance model in simulation unit of farmland the soil water balance was simulated in each farmland unit the water balance in the crop root zone for a farmland unit was described by li et al 2017a 1 δ w n t p n t i n t et n t qs n t δ t where subscript n and t represent the number of farmland units and days in the crop growing period respectively δw nt is

empirical coefficients note that qs nt 0 indicated deep percolation while qs nt 0 meant upward recharge from the lower zone to the root zone et nt was determined by crop types growing seasons atmosphere condition and the soil moisture status allen et al 1998 which was calculated as 3 et n t k s n t k c n t et 0 t where k cnt is the daily crop coefficient dimensionless that is obtained from

θ cn wilting soil water content θ wn and empirical coefficients a n and b n these parameters were mainly depended on soil types and were calibrated and validated using soil water content data measured in the yingke irrigation district for each soil type fig 2 c during field experiments over two years 2012 and 2013 for details the measured soil water content data in 2012 were used to calibrate the model using the error and trial approach while the model was validated using the measured data in 2013 the model performance was evaluated using the normalized root mean square error nrmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the coefficient of determination r 2 these indices were calculated from 6 nrmse 100 o a v e 1 k k 1 k s k o k 2 7 nse 1 k 1 k s k o k 2 k 1 k o k o a v e 2 8 r 2 k 1 k s k

and s ave and o ave are the average values of the simulated and measured data respectively the simulation results were considered excellent when nrmse 10 good if 10 nrmse 20 acceptable if 20 nrmse 30 and poor if nrmse 30 ran et al 2017 2018 moreover if nse 0 5 the model simulation could be judged as satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 regarding the value of r 2 r 2 0 5 was considered acceptable legates and mccabe 1999 ran et al 2017 2018 the calibration procedure stopped when the indices mentioned above were all in acceptable ranges to further validate the model the final calibrated parameters were used to simulate the field soil water content processes in 2013 and the model performance during the validation period was also evaluated using the same statistical indices as the calibration period moriasi et al 2007 3 2 3 water balance in the whole study region the gross amount of water diverted from rivers and extracted from groundwater aquifer q m3 was distributed to the irrigation districts and farmland units through canal system net amount of irrigation water applied to irrigation district m was qi m m3 m 1 2 m the relationship of q qi m i n and a n were described as follows 9 q m 1 m q i m η m 10 m 1 m q i m n 1 n i n a n where m 17 is total number of irrigation districts in the study region η m is the canal efficiency of district m considering both diversion from river water and groundwater pumping table 1 moreover n 1 2 n where n 351 is the total number of farmland units in the study region i n and a n are irrigation water depth in the crop growth period m and area m2 of farmland unit n respectively considering that the maximum times of irrigation in a crop growth period was j 4 i n was calculated from the sum of net irrigation water depth in all irrigation applications which was 11 i n j 1 j i n j where i nj is the net irrigation water depth m for the jth application to farmaland unit n 3 3 optimization model for spatiotemporal irrigation water allocation in the arid regions water shortage was the controlling factor for agriculture production therefore more efficient use of the irrigation water and precipitation was the primary focus of agricultural water management irrigation and precipitation use efficiency in the farmland unit n ipue n and each irrigation district or the whole study region ipue were defined as 12 ipue n et n i n p n 13 ipue n 1 n et n a n n 1 n i n a n p n a n where et n and p n are total evapotranspiration m and total precipitation m in the crop growth period of unit n respectively et n was obtained by the sum of daily evapotranspiration et nt simulated by the soil water balance models eqs 1 5 for any given irrigation scheduling in addition to irrigation and precipitation soil water storage can also contribute to crop evapotranspiration consequently ipue might exceed 1 in cases with less irrigation and or higher initial soil water storage however over use of soil water storage was not sustainable to obtain higher ipue and avoid over use of soil water storage the squared difference of ipue to its ideal value of 1 was set as the objective function in this study 14 min z ipue 1 2 there were mainly three types of constraints for the optimization model 1 net irrigation water depth for each crop type should be in an appropriate range i e 15 i l min i l i l max l 1 2 3 4 where i l i lmin and i lmax are net irrigation water depth and the minimum and maximum irrigation water depths m for crop l in this study i lmin for all crops was set as zero and i lmax for maize spring wheat barley and other crops were set as 790 mm 520 mm 520 mm and 520 mm respectively 2 to improve the efficiency of optimization process irrigation interval constraints were added in this study for details the irrigation interval between two irrigation applications was smaller than the crop growth period divided by the maximum times of irrigation applications j i e 16 1 δ t n j t n j t n j t n j 1 δ t n j j 1 2 j where t n is the days of growing period for the crop in unit n d t nj is the date of the jth irrigation application of unit n t n0 0 δt nj is the irrigation interval between the j 1 th and jth irrigation applications 3 total net irrigation water constraints 17 q min m 1 m q i m q max where q min and q max are the minimal and maximal net irrigation water amount m3 in the optimization farmland units with the same crops and soil types were assumed to have the same irrigation scheduling therefore the decision variables were the irrigation dates t lsj and amounts i lsj of four applications for four crops and four soil types where l s j 1 2 3 4 represent the number of crops soil types and irrigation applications respectively consequently the total number of decision variables was 2 4 4 4 128 3 4 scenario design in this study two scenarios current situation and representative climate years were set to optimize irrigation water allocation the climate conditions from 2000 to 2010 were set as the current situation in this situation the canal efficiency of different irrigation districts and meteorological factors in each year were used to get the optimal irrigation water allocation strategy and the optimal results were compared with the present irrigation water allocation strategy three representative precipitation years including wet 75 normal 50 and dry 25 years were determined by an optimum curve fitting method of the frequency curve based on the historical precipitation data from 1963 to 2016 at zhangye meteorological station the canal efficiency for each irrigation district in 2010 was used during the simulation which ranged from 0 59 in banqiao to 0 79 in shahe irrigation district table 1 the gross irrigation constraints were set from 0 7 to 2 1 billion m3 while the net irrigation amount were from 0 5 to 1 5 billion m3 with 0 05 billion m3 interval for details we set the net irrigation amount in 21 intervals of 0 45 0 50 0 50 0 55 1 45 1 50 billion m3 each of which was used as the lower and upper limit of constraint q min and q max eq 17 to obtain the optimal irrigation water allocation strategy for different representative climate years data used in each scenario was listed in table 3 4 results 4 1 model calibration and validation the distributed farmland water balance model was calibrated with the maize field observations of average soil water content in 0 110 cm soil layer in 2012 and validated with observational data in 2013 comparisons of simulated and measured soil water content for model calibration and validation are shown in fig 5 and the calibrated parameters for different soil types are presented in table 4 results showed that the simulated values of soil water content were in agreement with the measured ones with nrmse ranging from 3 35 to 4 73 for calibration and from 3 97 to 6 5 for validation which indicated that the simulation results were excellent for nrmse ran et al 2017 2018 the nse values were ranging from 0 76 to 0 90 during the calibration period while from 0 55 to 0 86 during the model validation period which showed that the model simulation was satisfactory following the criterion of moriasi et al 2007 the determination coefficients r 2 showed a higher correlation values ranging from 0 76 to 0 90 between the simulated and measured values during both the calibration and validation periods overall the results showed good performance of the simulation model and indicated its capability of simulating the soil water content processes at farmland units in the study area since maize was the dominant crop covering an area of 48 in the study region field measurements and model calibration and validation were only performed in the maize field however model parameters related to soil properties table 4 were mainly influenced by soil texture and therefore they were also applicable to farmland units with different crops by considering the soil types crop parameters such as k c for different crops were obtained from available studies in the study area yin et al 2012 therefore the calibrated model was applicable to farmland units with different crops and soil types 4 2 optimal irrigation water allocation under current situations 4 2 1 irrigation scheduling water balance and ipue for different farmland units table 5 shows the optimal irrigation schedules for maize spring wheat barley and vegetable from 2000 to 2010 the table showed that 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th irrigation for maize should be applied before 45 days 85 days 117 days and 157 days after crop planting respectively optimal irrigation water depths for each irrigation application were in the range of 37 220 mm the optimized irrigation schedules in soil types t1 and t2 were similar where irrigation should be applied in around 18 45 days 38 85 days 77 117 days and 100 157 days with irrigation water depths from 57 to 173 mm 49 179 mm 42 181 mm and 48 194 mm respectively however the optimized irrigation schedules for maize in soil types t3 and t4 were more scattered compared with those in t1 and t2 further the 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th irrigation to spring wheat should be applied before 44 days 75 days 108 days and 124 days after crop planting the results of spring wheat for different soil types were similar in t1 and t2 and t3 and t4 soil types similarly the 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th irrigation for barley should be applied before 43 days 82 days 114 days and 147 days after the plantation moreover the 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th irrigation for vegetables should be applied before 45 days 75 days 113 days and 144 days after planting fig 6 shows the average values of water balance components from 2000 to 2010 for different farmland units before and after optimization at the present scenario without optimization evapotranspiration ranged from 420 mm to 619 mm while the irrigation water depth varied from 436 mm to 786 mm vegetable had the highest evapotranspiration among all other crops followed by maize on the other hand spring wheat and barley had the lowest evapotranspiration deep percolation played an important role in the water consumption by all crops which resulted in lower ipue the ipue of vegetables was higher than other crops due to its higher consumption rate moreover the evapotranspiration in t2 type soil was smaller than other soil types irrespective of crop types before optimization the evapotranspiration for different crops after optimization ranged from 419 mm to 610 mm with an average deep percolation of 27 mm after optimization the net irrigation water depth was 319 547 mm and ipue could be increased to almost 1 08 the optimal irrigation water depths were about 326 mm 327 mm 471 mm and 495 mm for spring wheat barley vegetable and maize respectively which resulted in an increased ipue close to 1 4 2 2 spatial distribution of ipue in the study area fig 7 depicts the distribution of major water balance components and ipue in 17 irrigation districts from 2000 to 2010 before optimization results showed that the average annual gross water diverted or pumped to the study area from 2000 to 2010 was about 21 1 108 m3 the average annual net irrigation water applied to farmland was 15 3 108 m3 and precipitation was 3 07 108 m3 youlian irrigation district with the maximum irrigated area received the most amount of irrigation water which was 2 81 108 m3 or 18 of the total irrigation water however the ipue in the youlian irrigation district was smaller 0 79 because about 24 of the irrigation water 6 8 107 m3 percolated to deeper soil layers the banqiao irrigation district had the lowest ipue of 0 71 while the luocheng irrigation district had the highest ipue of 1 09 fig 7 d fig 8 shows the average ipues in different irrigation districts from 2000 to 2010 after optimization and their improvement compared with the present condition it can be seen that all ipues in different irrigation districts were increased to more than 0 93 after optimization which meant that most of the irrigation water and local precipitation was used for crop water evapotranspiration except the luocheng irrigation district ipue in all other irrigation districts was improved after optimization maximum increase 0 3 in ipue was observed in banqiao irrigation district which resulted in 4 56 107 m3 37 reduction in irrigation water on the other hand ipue in luocheng irrigation district was decreased by 0 08 because ipue in luocheng irrigation district was 1 09 higher than the ideal value of 1 before optimization after optimization water allocated to this district was increased considering the total ipue for the whole study area the average annual gross irrigation water used in the entire study area for the period 2000 2010 would decrease from 21 1 108 m3 to 16 8 108 m3 due to irrigation water optimization in other words spatiotemporal optimization of irrigation water could save 20 of the irrigation water in the study area with more efficient use of irrigation water 4 2 3 annual water balance and ipue of the study area fig 9 shows the annual water balance of the study area from 2000 to 2010 it can be seen that evapotranspiration was the major component of water consumption which accounted for 76 96 of the total water consumption before optimization and 83 99 after optimization the evapotranspiration before and after optimization was ranging from 14 4 108 m3 to 16 7 108 m3 and 14 5 108 m3 to 15 6 108 m3 respectively moreover evapotranspiration was highest in 2004 and lowest in 2002 during the study period which was caused by the higher or lower reference evapotranspiration in these two years respectively irrigation was the primary source of water supply for farmland evapotranspiration which accounted for 68 95 of the total water supply before optimization and 65 83 after optimization the amount of water allocated to the farmland ranged from 11 9 108 m3 to 16 3 108 m3 before optimization which decreased to 10 5 108 13 5 108 m3 after the optimization it indicated that 1 4 108 m3 to 2 8 108 m3 net irrigation water can be saved in the entire study area using the optimal allocation scheme in other words 12 17 of net irrigation water can be saved due to optimization the ipue before optimization ranged from 0 73 to 0 98 while it ranged from 0 95 to 1 01 after optimization the optimized irrigation scheme increased the ipue by 0 02 0 23 or 2 31 compared with the present scenario these results agreed with zhou et al 2014 which confirmed that the ipue would increase by 9 after reasonably allocating the water resources in the same study area it can be concluded from these results that the ipue can generally be improved significantly through the appropriate spatiotemporal allocation of irrigation water 4 3 optimal irrigation water allocation in different climate years 4 3 1 water balance and ipue for the whole study area under different net irrigation amounts results of annual water balance and ipue for different net irrigation amounts under optimal irrigation water allocation in different climate years are presented in fig 10 it can be seen that ipue decreased with the net irrigation water amount under all the climate conditions which indicated that the proportion of irrigation water consumed for evapotranspiration decreased with the increasing of irrigation ipue under a wet year was lower than other climate years which was caused by more precipitation in the wet year and similar evapotranspiration for different climate years after optimization result also showed that ipues were all above 0 8 for all the climate conditions after optimization among the water balance components evapotranspiration was the highest water consumer while irrigation and precipitation were the main sources of water supply in cases with insufficient irrigation water supplied to the farmland water stored in the soil layer was consumed by evapotranspiration and the ipue was higher than 1 ipues were approximately 1 when the net irrigation water amounts of 12 5 108 m3 13 7 108 m3 14 2 108 m3 in wet normal and dry years respectively and the corresponding gross irrigation water amounts were 17 2 108 m3 18 9 108 m3 and 19 7 108 m3 respectively in this case almost all irrigation water and precipitation were used by evapotranspiration which was taken as ideal water amounts for different years with more irrigation water applied to farmland the soil water storage in the crop root zone increased slightly and the ipues reduced to less than 1 4 3 2 temporal allocation of irrigation water fig 11 showed the monthly gross irrigation water allocated to different irrigation districts under the ideal water amounts for different climate years results showed that most of the irrigation water should be allocated to irrigation districts in may and july under wet and normal years the amounts of irrigation water allocated in these two months accounted for 63 and 74 of total irrigation water in the wet and normal years respectively however in the dry year july was the peak month of irrigation for all the irrigation districts and the percentage of irrigation water in july was 38 of the total the amount of irrigation water allocated to irrigation districts in the other three months april may and june were similar which were all approximately 18 of the total in each month for a dry year the difference in optimal irrigation scheduling in different climate years was mainly caused by the temporal distributions of precipitation in different climate years and crop distribution precipitation in august was higher than other months which resulted in less irrigation requirements in addition spring wheat and barley were both harvested in august which resulted in no irrigation requirement for wheat and barley fields this result also demonstrated the superiority of the simulation based optimization method for spatiotemporal allocation of irrigation water because the simulation model could reflect the impact of climate variations and depicted the soil water balance in different farmlands the total gross irrigation water allocated to different irrigation districts is presented in table 6 4 3 3 spatial allocation of irrigation water fig 12 depicts the distribution of irrigation water depth amount and ipue for different farmland units and irrigation districts the results showed that irrigation water allocated to different farmland units in normal and dry years were higher than those in the wet year precipitation amount in the wet year was much higher than that in a normal or dry year therefore the optimal irrigation water allocated to different farmland units in the wet year was the lowest the irrigation water depth in the southeastern part was much higher than the other parts of the study area because most of the crops with higher water consumption were planted in this area ipue for different farmland units ranged from 0 92 to 1 23 for different irrigation districts irrigation water allocations were more in the middle strip than other districts because most of the farmland was located along the heihe river 5 discussion after optimal spatial temporal allocation of irrigation water evapotranspiration for different crops would be slightly smaller than those before optimization while the average deep percolation would be decreased dramatically under current situation fig 6 meanwhile the net irrigation water depth would be decreased significantly for details the net irrigation water depths of maize spring wheat and barley would be decreased considerably by 0 05 45 as compared with those before optimization while that of vegetation would be decreased slightly demonstrated that spring wheat and barley had the highest water saving potential than other crops similar results of optimal irrigation water depths were obtained in other studies in the same study area for example jiang et al 2016 obtained the optimal irrigation water depths of 450 592 mm for maize and 250 379 mm for wheat to obtain the maximum total benefit in the yingke irrigation district which were consistent with our results 495 mm for maize and 326 mm for spring wheat the distribution of evapotranspiration was related to the vegetables cultivation because of the higher evapotranspiration of vegetables for examples evapotranspiration in the northwest part youlian irrigation district was higher than other parts fig 7 which was due to its concentrated distribution of vegetables while in the southern part huazhaizi irrigation district where mostly spring wheat and barley crops were cultivated evapotranspiration was lower moreover the irrigation districts close to the heihe river had higher evapotranspiration rates on account of its favorable condition for water diversion as compared to other irrigation districts the farmland area in irrigation districts around the heihe river was also much higher than other districts for the luocheng irrigation district located in the lower middle reach of the heihe river basin with abundant land resources and scarce water resources it had less cultivated land and smaller evapotranspiration amount as compared with other irrigation districts in general irrigation districts in the upper part or close to the heihe river had better irrigation conditions and smaller ipue and vice versa therefore it was necessary to improve the irrigation water allocation strategies to increase the impartiality of irrigation water allocation and the ipue in the whole study area results of optimal spatial allocation of irrigation water under different climate years table 6 showed that irrigation water requirements were the highest in a dry year moderate in the normal year and lowest in the wet year amounts of irrigation water allocated to different irrigation districts were firstly determined by the irrigated area where the two largest irrigation districts xijun and youlian received the most amount of irrigation water in different climate years while the smallest irrigation district huazhaizi received the least amount of irrigation water in all three climate years besides the amount of allocated irrigation water was also influenced by crop planting patterns and irrigation districts with more fractions of high water demand crops such as vegetables generally received more water per unit irrigated area for example although the irrigated area of the youlian irrigation district was smaller than the xijun irrigation district a higher percentage of vegetables in youlian resulted in more allocated irrigation water in wet and normal years ipue of different farmland units depended on the climate condition and applied irrigation water depth fig 12 ipue was higher in the dry year as compared to the other years because precipitation was much smaller in a dry year and irrigation water was used more effectively to compensate for the evapotranspiration meanwhile ipue was generally smaller in districts with more allocated irrigation water after the optimization of irrigation water allocation ipue would be higher than 0 92 for all the climate conditions therefore the distributed simulation based optimization model developed in this study can be recommended as an efficient tool to optimize the irrigation water allocation under various scenarios both on spatial and temporal scales in arid regions 6 conclusions to allocate limited irrigation water resources in arid and semi arid regions a distributed farmland water balance model based optimization model is developed in this study to maximize the irrigation and precipitation use efficiency ipue in arid region the model is applied to the middle reach of heihe river basin to optimize the irrigation water allocation in both time and space under various scenarios the optimal irrigation water depth for the crops in the study area ranged from 319 mm to 547 mm about 20 of irrigation water can be saved annually in the entire study area if the irrigation water allocation was optimized during the period 2000 2010 after irrigation water allocation ipue could be reached higher than 0 92 for all the climate conditions to achieve an ideal ipue of 1 gross irrigation water amounts of 17 2 108 m3 18 9 108 m3 and 19 7 108 m3 were required for the wet year normal year and dry year respectively the optimized irrigation allocation scheme could ensure that almost all the precipitation and irrigation were consumed by the crops based on their requirement and provided a scientific basis for decision makers to allocate the irrigation water resources more efficiently it should be noted that the distributed simulation based optimization model developed in this study was applicable for addressing irrigation water allocation problems in arid regions some constraints were specific to the arid study area and some of them should be reconsidered when using this model to another study region besides this work was conducted with limited available data in order to obtain more accurate optimal spatial temporal irrigation water allocation results more detailed
