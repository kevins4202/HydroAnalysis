14090,this study analyzes the outcomes obtained with the treatment of coagulation flocculation applied to industrial wastewater coming from an oil tanker characteristics of this wastewater are high salinity and the presence of recalcitrant pollutants predominantly of hydrocarbon origin therefore the application of a chemical physical treatment is preferred rather than biological treatment since the simultaneous effect of salinity and hydrocarbons plays an inhibitory role in biomass growth in coagulation flocculation process the first phase of coagulation aims at electrical destabilization of pollutants particles whereas the flocculation phase allows destabilized particles to aggregate and form flakes which then the last phase of the process removes from effluent by sedimentation or flotation the novelty of this experimentation consists in the optimization of the continuous wastewater treatment with advantages both economic and in terms of treatment flexibility the observation of the continuous process has highlighted the need for a deflector element in the passage section from the flocculation to the sedimentation compartment to guarantee the establishment of the calm conditions necessary to allow sedimentation inside the last compartment results analysis has shown that the process allows high removal efficiencies of the main pollutants analyzed in this study in particular the removal efficiency of tss always stood at values greater than 90 while the removal efficiency of tph was even almost close to 100 instead the removal of the organic substance in terms of cod and toc has achieved lower performances therefore in the outlet wastewater the levels of the contaminants were usually lower than the limits imposed by law to allow the discharge into the receiving water body sea the best test was the one in which the slop fed to the system of coagulation flocculation was previously subjected to a treatment in which the oil was removed furthermore the presence of the deflector element favors the sludge settling and therefore the removal of pollutants from the clarified keywords slops salinity hydrocarbons continuous coagulation flocculation sludge 1 introduction laws regarding the protection of the marine environment pay great attention to systematic or operational pollution due to the spillage of contaminated water into the sea during the tank washing operations of ships carrying oil imo marpol 73 78 waters produced by this process are called slops and are characterized by high concentrations of hydrocarbons and high salinity as well as by the presence of other pollutants such as oil and surfactants 1 2 numerous physical chemical and biological treatments used individually or combined are available for the treatment of waters contaminated with hydrocarbons 3 5 in biological treatments the dominant mechanism for the removal of hydrocarbons consists in the biodegradation of petroleum contaminants by microorganisms therefore the process is similar to bio flocculation where flocculation is induced by extracellular polymeric compounds such as polysaccharides and proteins derived from microalgae and other microorganisms 6 however the settling of biological sludge in saline environments involves several problems 7 8 among the causes of this phenomenon is the greater density of salt water compared to fresh water this generates buoyancy thrusts that resist the gravimetric decantation of the sludge this drawback can be overcome by using aerobic granular sludge technology as demonstrated in a recent study by campo and di bella 4 secondly the high salinity in wastewater causes a considerable increase in the osmotic pressure between the liquid bulk and the intracellular content this implies a strong concentration gradient between what is contained within the cellular membranes of microorganisms and the mixed liquor due to this concentration gradient to rebalance the external osmotic pressure microorganisms activate a liquid transport mechanism from the inside of their cells towards the liquid bulk this inevitably leads to cells plasmolysis and to the death of the microorganisms normally present in the wastewater 9 for these reasons chemical physical treatments are nowadays the elective treatments for the removal of organic recalcitrant and inorganic substance from industrial wastewater 10 12 these treatments are widely used for their high purification efficiency and adaptability to toxic and recalcitrant compounds even though they involve higher opex costs mainly due to the use of chemical reagents and the disposal of chemical sludge produced during the various treatment phases 13 one of the most widely used chemical physical processes for treating industrial wastewater is coagulation flocculation 14 16 coagulation flocculation is a chemical physical treatment that allows thanks to the addition of specific chemical agents the precipitation of non settling colloidal suspended solids and also of very fine sedimentable solids difficult to eliminate with a simple physical treatment due to their extremely low sedimentation rate 17 19 this treatment can also represent a preliminary phase in a more complex chain that involves refining processes of adsorption and oxidation 20 the treatment is divided into three different phases coagulation flocculation and sedimentation the coagulation phase thanks to the addition of coagulant substances aims to destabilize the colloidal suspensions by breaking down the repulsive forces due to the presence of charges of the same sign on the surface of colloids at this point these particles can interact with each other by agglomerating themselves first in micro flakes and then in flakes of gradually increasing size for a correct coagulation an energetic mixing is required inside the coagulation compartment allowed by stirrers that rotate at high speed flocculation consists in the further destabilization of colloidal substances and above all in the agglomeration of destabilized particles that give rise to micro flakes and later to flakes that settle easily while a vigorous stirring is favorable in the coagulation phase in the flocculation phase the stirring speed must be neither too low nor too high in order to avoid sedimentation and breakage of the flake in order for the flocculation to occur it is necessary to add to the water substances called coagulation adjuvants or flocculants 21 once flocs have reached such dimensions as to allow their precipitation the last sedimentation phase begins in which a calm tank allows them to settle and then be removed from the water among the literature studies concerning the in continuous coagulation flocculation treatment of industrial wastewater it is possible to mention the one conducted by suarez et al 22 this study evaluates the suitability of coagulation flocculation and flotation processes in the pre treatment of hospital type industrial wastewater at pilot scale continuous processes offer evident advantages such as the possibility of treating with the same useful volume higher flow rates and ensuring a continuous production of the treated effluent eliminating the dead times that are intrinsic in batch treatments in the case of continuous coagulation flocculation the optimization of discontinuous process jar test depends on other parameters such as hydrodynamics linked to the mixing method and the geometry of the tanks these parameters must limit the retroflux and entrapment phenomena of the developing particles 23 the main objective of this study is the evaluation of coagulation flocculation purifying efficiency for the removal of pollutants present in the slops in particular treatment efficiency was evaluated in terms of removal of total suspended solids tss chemical oxygen demand cod total organic carbon toc total petroleum hydrocarbon tph and heavy metals present in process sludge the main elements of innovativeness of the study are i continuous bench pilot tests for the optimization of coagulation flocculation ii the treatment of real industrial wastewater such as slops the main hypothesis of the present work was that by applying a continuous configuration for coagulation flocculation of real industrial slop wastewater coupled with a specific deflector system improve the overall pollutants removal efficiencies of the coagulation flocculation treatment actually continuous feeding is typical for full scale coagulation flocculation treatments 24 therefore the novelty of the present experimentation consists in the realization of a laboratory scale plant fed in continuous as a proof of concept for up scaling the proposed layout this constitutes an intermediate step between the process performed in batch useful for establishing the optimal parameters and the process performed in real scale plants in fact the coagulation flocculation process is often based on the results of the jar tests which do not take into account the effects of a continuous treatment to date lab scale coagulation flocculation studies are commonly performed in batch whereas as the main application of coagulation flocculation treatment systems at full scale operate in continuous the present study aims at reproduce the continuous treatment at lab scale thus representing a direct continuation of a previous work of the same research group 3 in this sense the observation of the phenomenon within the bench scale model can be useful to highlight the hydrodynamic characteristics of the process inevitably linked to the treatment efficiency especially when oily water is treated 2 materials and methods the present experimental study concerns the treatment of slops collected from tankers used to transport petroleum products and operating in the port of augusta sr italy for the treatment of this industrial wastewater a laboratory scale bench scale system operating continuously has been developed 2 1 characterization of wastewater in order to determine the main polluting parameters that the coagulation flocculation treatment must remove table 1 shows the characterization of slops used in this study sampled in two different moments and indicated as sample 1 and sample 2 the measurement of each parameter was repeated several times in order to obtain a data as real as possible and the value shown in the table is the average of the values obtained in the different tests due to the high salinity conditions the cod was measured by chemical titration with the addition of mercury sulfate in order to eliminate chloride interference the measures of ammonium and of all anions were carried out by means of ionic chromatography by ics dionex 1100 the total organic carbon toc was measured by means of thermos catalytic oxidation with a high temperature toc vcsh analyzer that also provides the total carbon tc and the inorganic carbon ic finally the tphs concentrations were measured using a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector gc fid agilent 6890 n after extraction of tphs from samples with hexane the analysis of the table shows that the organic substance and hydrocarbons are the main pollutants present in the washing waters in the last column of the table the limits for the discharge of industrial wastewater into surface waters are reported the legislative limits are contained in table 3 of annex 5 to the third part of the legislative decree 152 06 25 bearing in mind that the rule 11 of annex iv of the marpol protocol 73 78 26 regulates wastewater discharge into the sea 2 2 choice of optimal dosage of coagulant and flocculant as mentioned above coagulation flocculation requires the addition of chemicals to be mixed with water for this reason it was necessary to choose the type and dose of reagents coagulant and flocculant and the rotation speed of the stirrers within the different compartments this choice derives from the results obtained in the study by di bella et al 3 in a discontinuous coagulation flocculation treatment conducted on the same type of wastewater at bench scale operational conditions within the present experimental campaign subsequent jar tests performed adopting the same types and doses of chemical reagents further validated the results produced by this study these tests also confirmed that aluminum sulphate al2 so4 3 18h2o tends to be the most performing coagulant even more if coupled with the polyelectrolyte a57 which is the anionic form of the flocculant as referenced by rastelli et al 27 and costantino et al 28 obviously the choice of reagents used in a chemical treatment also depends on economic factors being the result of a cost benefit analysis in the present study however there are no elements of economic nature regarding the costs of chemical compounds as a detailed dissertation of this is present in the aforementioned work by di bella et al 3 to which this study refers for the choice of reagents to be used table 2 shows the combinations of doses of coagulant and flocculant used in the jar tests performed both for raw slop waters and for those previously de oiled in both samples 1 and 2 specifically the jar tests performed on de oiled slops confirmed that the removal efficiency of coagulation flocculation treatment increases as the coagulant concentrations increase on the other hand by increasing the dose of flocculant there are no significant improvements the jar tests performed on raw slop i e not previously de oiled have shown that the use of flocculant even though in small doses increases the separation speed of solid particles from the clarified consequently it was decided to add aluminum sulfate al2 so4 3 in the dose of 90 mg l and to limit the addition of anionic flocculant a57 at a dose of 1 mg l since the use of larger doses would be uneconomical on a large scale 2 3 sizing of the plant units the continuous coagulation flocculation process has been carried out on a laboratory scale following a preliminary design and a maximum dimensioning the flow rate of slop water to be treated was set at about 3 l h as regards the sizing of the units necessary for the coagulation flocculation process the choice of operating parameters and of stirring speed of each specific process phase is based on hypotheses related to the hydraulic retention time hrt and to the speed gradients necessary in the coagulation and flocculation processes the volume of the individual units was calculated to maintain the wastewater within the specific compartment for the fixed hrt through the simple and canonical relation 1 1 v q hrt where v is the volume of the compartment and q is the flow rate coagulation is a rapid process characterized by an energetic mixing that must allow the destabilization of the colloids charge and an initial aggregation of the particles coagulation compartment therefore was dimensioned in such a way as to have a speed gradient of the mechanical mixer equal to 500 s 1 and a contact time of 2 min generally in normal coagulation flocculation treatments the coagulation phase lasts between 30 s and 1 min however it should be emphasized that in the case of a bench scale model the literature ranges are often more extensive due to limitations of the same physical model compartment in any case the choice of a larger hrt with a subsequent greater volume of the sector involves a slightly more lasting process but without clearly negative effects on the contrary the volumetric increase has no economic impact in plants at this scale the coagulation compartment was then sized so that the wastewater remained inside for a holding time equal to the desired contact time with the dosed coagulant from the formula reported in eq 1 a volume of 100 ml was sized due to the small size of the coagulation compartment the energetic agitation of the wastewater was possible only using a magnetic stirrer rotating at a speed of 200 rpm flocculation on the other hand is the process during which through slow agitation the particles form flakes of gradually increasing dimensions for this reason it was decided a speed gradient of the mechanical mixer equal to 50 s 1 and a contact time of 30 min the flocculation compartment therefore was sized considering a hydraulic retention time of 30 min obtaining a volume of 1 5 liters the slow stirring inside the flocculation compartment was allowed by a mechanical vertical stirrer type velp rotating at a speed of 20 rpm equipped at the end with a fixed stainless steel blade with dimensions of 4 1 5 cm finally sedimentation or flotation depending on the type of wastewater fed whether pre treated or not represents the phase of calm in which the flakes settle on the bottom or float on the surface for the latter compartment with a detention time of 120 min a volume of 6 liters was obtained finally it was necessary to dimension the volumes of the tanks containing the coagulant and flocculant solutions so that the concentrations of chemical reagents established during the jar tests were present within the various compartments of the reactor as previously mentioned as a coagulant it was decided to use aluminum sulphate in a concentration of 90 mg l to maintain this concentration inside the coagulation compartment it was necessary to use a solution of al2 so4 3 in distilled water with a concentration of 562 5 mg l a reservoir of 2 liters of distilled water was used with 1 125 g of coagulant inside instead the anionic polyelectrolyte a57 in concentration of 1 mg l was used as flocculant to obtain this concentration inside the flocculation compartment it was necessary to use a solution of a57 in distilled water with a concentration of 5 55 mg l a reservoir of 2 5 liters of distilled water was then used with 13 9 ml of flocculant inside in table 3 the parameters used for sizing the various sections of the plant are reported 2 4 description of the experimental apparatus and process lay out the coagulation flocculation treatment consists in the succession of the coagulation and flocculation phases followed by sedimentation that remove most of the polluting substances and incorporate them in the sludge extracted from the bottom of the sedimentation compartment while the clarified treated flows from the surface through a light 29 in the present study the experimental observation of the coagulation flocculation process carried out for oily waters however has shown that the nature of this specific type of wastewater is such as to allow the removal of colloidal particles not only for sedimentation but also for flotation of floating flakes this is mainly due to the high concentration of oils and substances with a lower specific weight than water so they tend to float the pre formed flakes in this case therefore the sludge consisting of solids and oils is removed from the free surface of the water while the clarified is extracted from an under light within the flotation compartment for these reasons the experimental campaign conducted in this study focused on the creation of two different plant layouts fig 1 layout a in which the last section of the plant was used as a sedimentation tank layout b in which instead the last section of the plant was used as a floatation tank of course the slop fed in the two different plant layouts has different characteristics to maximize the capacity of the particles to settle or float depending on the case in particular in the first configuration the slop water was fed after a de oiling treatment inside a pre oil separation compartment separated from the plant in order to remove most of the present oils the raw slop was poured into this compartment and kept calm for a time equal to the holding time of the final sedimentation compartment during this phase most of the oils contained in the slop floated to the surface and were then removed with the aid of a steel ladle on the other hand in the second configuration the plant was fed with raw wastewater in order to allow the oils to float in the final flotation compartment bringing with them the solids and the main pollutants present in the slops fig 1 shows the four sampling sections named as below s1 input section for coagulation flocculation treatment i e the de oiled slop in layout a and the raw slop in layout b s2 section at the exit from the flocculation compartment s3 system exit section ssludge and spost float separated sludge in the final solid liquid separation phase respectively in sedimentation ssludge and flotation spost float furthermore during the various tests the particles present in the sedimentation flotation compartment tend to return to the flocculation one therefore in order to hinder or mitigate the hydrodynamic backscatter effects in both plant layouts it was decided to insert a deflector element between the flocculation compartment and the sedimentation flotation compartment to accommodate the exit of the aggregated particles from the flocculator and prevent its backflow therefore for each layout two different tests were performed with and without deflector for a total of four tests in particular in the first case the deflector was placed at an angle of 45 downwards to accommodate sedimentation while in the second case it was placed at an angle of 45 upwards to accommodate the flotation of oils and fats fig 2 shows the two system diagrams with the appropriate coding test a de oiled wastewater without deflector between flocculation and sedimentation test b de oiled wastewater with deflector between flocculation and sedimentation test c raw wastewater without deflector between flocculation and flotation test d raw wastewater with deflector between flocculation and flotation all experimental tests presented in the study were performed at room temperature this is because in a chemical physical treatment such as that of coagulation flocculation this parameter is difficult to control and the mixing due to the rotation of the mechanical blades determines a constant process temperature value regardless of the environmental conditions 3 results and discussion for all the analyzed pollutants this section reports the output values from each section of the system according to the denominations and symbolism shown in fig 1 it also proposes comparative histograms concerning pollutant removal efficiencies total between s1 and s3 and partial from section to section these efficiencies have been calculated by means of mass balances expressed by the relation 2 2 η sin sout sin 100 where sin is always section s1 which is the value of the pollutant in the slop at coagulation flocculation plant s inlet while sout is the value of the pollutant referring each time to section s2 partial or to section s3 total 3 1 effect of oil removal on raw wastewater as previously mentioned in the two tests carried out using the layout a of the plant test a and test b see fig 2a and b the slop was subjected to a preliminary de oiling treatment before being sent for the effective clarification treatment in this installation the preliminary de oiling treatment aimed at removing most of the oils present in the slop plays a fundamental role allowing to reduce the load of pollutants sent to the effective coagulation flocculation treatment table 4 shows that the initial phase of oil removal is able to reduce the concentration of pollutants taken into consideration during the experimentation in fact in this case the de oiled slop was less hard than the one started to coagulation in the subsequent tests test c and d in which the de oiling phase is not present in the raw slop wastewater the much higher particulate matter concentration expressed as tss undoubtedly influenced the coagulation flocculation treatment efficiencies in order to consider the above mentioned aspect and to avoid misunderstandings in the analysis of the results the authors compared the layouts two by two i e test a with test b and test c with test d in table 4 the data of the two independent samples are reported despite the high removal efficiencies allowed by the preliminary de oiling phase as shown in the table the values of all the pollutants are still much higher than the legislative limits for the spillage in the receiving water bodies especially for tph in light of the achieved results the oil removal treatment is configured exclusively as a preliminary step aimed at reducing the slop s polluting load which must necessarily be followed by a specific purification treatment basically given by chemical physical one in the following sub sections the results of the total as well as partial removal efficiency of the treatment chain calculated according to eq 2 are discussed these yields have been calculated considering as starting values those of the pollutants present in the de oiled or raw wastewater see fig 1 layout a or b respectively in particular the partial removal efficiency of the suspended solids of the organic matter and of the petroleum hydrocarbons are calculated according to 3 ηpart s1 s2 s1 100 whereas the total removal is obtained considering the system exit section 4 ηtot s1 s3 s1 100 3 2 removal of total suspended solids coagulation flocculation processes have been designed for promoting removal of suspended solids and colloids from wastewater which do not settle spontaneously typically removal of tss could be increased from 40 to 70 without coagulation up to 60 90 if a coagulant is used 28 in the case of the slop wastewaters considered in this work the suspended particles showed good settling properties both in the case of slop previously de oiled and in the case of raw slop fig 3 shows the variation of the concentrations and the removal performance of the dissolved and non settling fraction of the total solids in particular in order to quantify the correct evolution of the process the solids were determined only in the supernatant of each sample obviously only in the final section this data coincides with the real solids content of the clarified fig 3 highlights that in the case of raw wastewater the removal efficiency of solids after coagulation flocculation s2 is clearly improved by the deflector passing from a value of 97 without deflector to a value close to 100 with deflector the experiments showed in fact that the inclined element causes an attenuation of the sporadic retro flow effects induced by the static mixer located in the flocculation compartment conversely when a pre treated de oiled wastewater is considered the deflector tends to act at least partially as a trap therefore the combined effect of turbulence generated by the agitation inside the flotation compartment s2 and the obstacle constituted by the deflector itself causes a partial reverse flow from the sedimentation to the flocculation compartments this behavior explains the effective reduction of the efficiency from 93 to 91 induced by the deflector acting as a flow barrier nevertheless the total removal efficiencies were satisfactory in all configurations with a slightly higher percentage in the case of raw wastewater influent as a simple percentage effect due to the higher concentration of floating particles in the case of non pre treated slop these results show that aluminum sulphate is a suitable coagulant for the removal of suspended solids from salt water contaminated with hydrocarbons different results have instead been obtained by suarez et al 22 suggesting that in the treatment of hospital wastewater the removal efficiency of tss increases if they are coagulated with fecl3 while it decreases in the case in which al2 so 4 is used 3 3 removal of organic matter removal of cod was highly influenced by the fraction of total cod associated to particulate and soluble organic matter according to the results achieved for the total suspended solid the overall removal of the organic matter in the final section s3 was quite satisfactory looking at the data reported in fig 4 in fact it is possible to observe that outlet cod concentrations were near or below the limit values imposed by legislative decree 152 06 160 mg l specifically the figure shows the variation of cod concentrations and the partial removal efficiencies in the chosen control sections once again in the light of the two tests carried out with and without de oiled phase in the case of de oiled wastewater it is possible to observe that the highest cod removal efficiency is verified in presence of the deflector 89 rather than without deflector 57 confirming that in the latter case a retroflux phenomenon occurs similarly in the absence of the deflector it is plausible to hypothesize the generalized influence of turbulence caused by the agitator inside the flocculation compartment which hinders the correct aggregation of the particles in the flocculation compartment itself whose flakes in formation are more sensitive to the break the tests carried out with raw wastewater analyzed in fig 4b and d reveal that the deflector improves the removal efficiency inside the flocculation compartment confirming the results achieved for tss even though in this case the difference with tests conducted without a deflector is much smaller as the efficiency increases from 94 to 98 thanks to this element this is due to a lower density of the flakes in the raw slop that make them easily separable by flotation for this reason despite the higher removal rates in the s2 section the residual cod concentration is greater in tests conducted with raw wastewater however in terms of concentration at the end of the treatment chain section s3 the cod concentrations are lower in the test performed with pre treated de oiled effluent conducted with the help of the deflector in any case both plant layouts showed quite satisfactory cod removal efficiencies especially when compared to the literature data where the coagulation flocculation treatment allows cod removals around 70 22 in this context it must be emphasized that the saline and oily nature of wastewater influences the correct analytical characterization due to the effect of heterogeneous organic components especially in recalcitrant organic components and in the presence of emulsions in this framework to have further confirmation about the removal efficiency of organic matter the study completes the analysis with the determination of toc although the law does not regulate the total organic carbon limit value as it is possible to observe in fig 5 the results seem to be apparently different from those obtained with the cod basically in term of toc the removal efficiency inside the flocculation compartment s2 and at the outlet of the plant has highest values in the test performed without deflector in fact toc measurement is a more complete parameter taking into account all the particles present in the liquid bulk both isolated and aggregated or emulsified the presence of the deflector leads to an increase in the toc in the effluent when compared with the tests conducted without a deflector in particular the toc removal efficiency decreases from 65 to 60 in the case of pre treated slop while it remains around 98 in the case of raw slop 3 4 removal of total petroleum hydrocarbons to complete the analysis on the removal of organic particles this section discusses the effect of treatments on wastewater both de oiled and raw in terms of total petroleum hydrocarbons hereafter tph removal it is worthwhile to specify that a preliminary oil removal treatment eliminates almost all these pollutants since the oils are mainly composed of hydrocarbons nevertheless fig 6 shows that coagulation and flocculation have contributed substantially to an increase of the removal efficiencies with tph values in the outlet section below the legal limit 5 mg l imposed by marpol 73 78 law moreover as shown by the data reported in fig 6 the presence of the deflector contributes positively to the removal of tph however the analysis of concentration data in each section shows that the process of tph removal applied to raw wastewater requires the entire treatment chain for the almost complete removal of all the hydrocarbon particles thus to respect the law limit 5 mg l looking at the raw wastewater cases fig 6b shows that without deflector the tph removal is achieved after the coagulation and flocculation phases section s2 whereas the presence of the deflector gives rise to a lower efficiency see fig 6d nevertheless the efficiency of tph reduction is almost equal close to 100 with or without the deflector when the solid liquid separation phase is performed section s3 in the case of de oiled slop the presence of the deflector fig 6a and c leads to an increase in efficiency from 90 to values also this time close to 100 3 5 comparative evaluation of reactor hydrodynamics the above analysis carried out in terms of removal efficiency of tss cod toc and tph highlighted a general advantage in term of both hydrodynamic circulation and pollutant reduction efficiency induced by the deflector installed in the passage section between flocculator and flotation sedimentation in order to better understand the effectively efficiency of the process of pollutants removal it is worthwhile focus the attention on the concentrations at the end of the coagulation flocculation separation chain the above analysis in fact suggests that the results are affected by the preliminary phase of oil removal to this aim in fig 7 the discharge concentrations of the entire treatment chain for all the experiments here conducted are reported specifically it is possible to observe that the tests carried out in the presence of a deflector are characterized by higher efficiency looking at the fig 7 in fact it can be observed that tests b and d have overall lower concentration values moreover it is worthwhile to underline that the pollutant concentrations at the outlet sections of the plant have always been lower than the limit imposed by the law for discharge into surface waters the only exceptions are registered for the cod parameter without deflectors in order to complete the critical analysis of the data it is also useful to investigate the fate of the aluminum dosed with the coagulant even though metals do not constitute a polluting element in slops in the coagulation flocculation process an excess of aluminum sulphate metal salts could lead to a production of an outflow discharge not respecting the law limits similar problems involve the accumulation in the chemical sludge of the aluminum used interestingly the presence of aluminum in the purified wastewater is ruled by restrictive limit on the other hand the aluminum contained in the solid matrix of the sewage sludge is more flexible since actual legislative decree does not report a limit value for this parameter anyway as pointed out by verma et al 20 the aluminum concentration in the sludge is an indirect measure of the adequate dosage of coagulant therefore in the present research the aluminum concentrations contained in the process sludge was analyzed in order to assess the effective dosage and the efficiency of coagulating effect at the end of the various tests the amount of sludge extracted by sedimentation from the tests in which slop was previously de oiled is roughly half if compared to the quantity of sludge extracted by flotation from the test that treated the slop without a preliminary phase of oil removal fig 8 shows concentration of aluminum in sludge extracted from the experiments and the concentration of aluminum in the clarified outlet flow section s3 specifically in the figure the highest concentration of aluminum in the sludge is observed in the de oiled slop layout a in the presence of the deflector element in this test there was a much higher concentration than in the sludge extracted in the test in which slop contained oils layout b always in the presence of the deflector element therefore even though the amount of sludge extracted from the tests on de oiled slop is lower the amount of aluminum actively used was certainly greater in the test carried out on the slop previously de oiled and where it was inserted the deflector element it is worthwhile to specify that the amount of aluminum dosed to the plant in the form of al2 so4 3 was the same for all four tests so a greater concentration of the metal in the sludge indicates a greater coagulation efficiency in the test on de oiled slop with the use of the deflector therefore from the mass balance there is a lower presence of aluminum in the clarified fig 8b in tests carried out without the deflector even though the concentration of aluminum in the sludge is high in the de oiled case fig 8a case a and low in raw case fig 8a case c the mass of aluminum is extremely low in both cases so it is expected that high level of dosed aluminum will exit the plant together with the clarified this is confirmed by the results reported in fig 8b this specific behavior can be attribute to the absence of the deflector responsible to hinder the correct sedimentation flotation of the sludge and causing concentrations higher than the limit values lgs d 152 2006 on the other hand in both tests carried out with the deflector on slop previously de oiled and on slop with oils according to some literature findings see among others alimoradi et al 29 the aluminum concentration in the clarified is lower than legislative limits concluding the dose of aluminum does not affect the coagulation process rather the efficiency of the pollutant reduction is influenced by the hydrodynamic condition induced by the presence of the deflector or by the presence of pre treatments i e de oiled process the aluminum dosage was in fact given by the classical quantities of the jar test reported in literature 4 conclusions the novelty of this study consists in the optimization of jar test results by analyzing a continuous bench scale plant for the treatment of recalcitrant slop wastewater in general the experimentation confirms good removal performance the uses of continuous plant eventually coupled with a specific deflector system underline further interesting results the removal efficiency of the sst has always settled on values greater than 90 with the exception of the test carried out on the de oiled slop without the use of the deflector element while the efficiency of tph removal was even almost close to 100 the removal of the organic substance in terms of cod and toc has instead shown lower returns however this data cannot limit process applicability since the organic substance anyway respects the discharge limits in the presence of the deflector this element mitigates retroflux effects due to which the solid particles from the sedimentation flotation compartment fall within the flocculation compartment the analysis of aluminum presence in the treated wastewater and in the sludge extracted from the plant at the end of the various tests shows that the presence of the deflector allows reaching concentrations of al in the clarified water below legislative limits in both plant layouts in particular the lower output concentrations occur in the case of wastewater supply with oils however the higher concentration of aluminum in the sludge extracted at the end of the test performed on slop previously de oiled indicates a greater coagulation efficiency all these observations suggest that the optimization of coagulation flocculation treatment performed on slop wastewaters is possible treating de oiled wastewater with the help of a deflector element that allows improving the overall hydrodynamic process declaration of competing

14090,this study analyzes the outcomes obtained with the treatment of coagulation flocculation applied to industrial wastewater coming from an oil tanker characteristics of this wastewater are high salinity and the presence of recalcitrant pollutants predominantly of hydrocarbon origin therefore the application of a chemical physical treatment is preferred rather than biological treatment since the simultaneous effect of salinity and hydrocarbons plays an inhibitory role in biomass growth in coagulation flocculation process the first phase of coagulation aims at electrical destabilization of pollutants particles whereas the flocculation phase allows destabilized particles to aggregate and form flakes which then the last phase of the process removes from effluent by sedimentation or flotation the novelty of this experimentation consists in the optimization of the continuous wastewater treatment with advantages both economic and in terms of treatment flexibility the observation of the continuous process has highlighted the need for a deflector element in the passage section from the flocculation to the sedimentation compartment to guarantee the establishment of the calm conditions necessary to allow sedimentation inside the last compartment results analysis has shown that the process allows high removal efficiencies of the main pollutants analyzed in this study in particular the removal efficiency of tss always stood at values greater than 90 while the removal efficiency of tph was even almost close to 100 instead the removal of the organic substance in terms of cod and toc has achieved lower performances therefore in the outlet wastewater the levels of the contaminants were usually lower than the limits imposed by law to allow the discharge into the receiving water body sea the best test was the one in which the slop fed to the system of coagulation flocculation was previously subjected to a treatment in which the oil was removed furthermore the presence of the deflector element favors the sludge settling and therefore the removal of pollutants from the clarified keywords slops salinity hydrocarbons continuous coagulation flocculation sludge 1 introduction laws regarding the protection of the marine environment pay great attention to systematic or operational pollution due to the spillage of contaminated water into the sea during the tank washing operations of ships carrying oil imo marpol 73 78 waters produced by this process are called slops and are characterized by high concentrations of hydrocarbons and high salinity as well as by the presence of other pollutants such as oil and surfactants 1 2 numerous physical chemical and biological treatments used individually or combined are available for the treatment of waters contaminated with hydrocarbons 3 5 in biological treatments the dominant mechanism for the removal of hydrocarbons consists in the biodegradation of petroleum contaminants by microorganisms therefore the process is similar to bio flocculation where flocculation is induced by extracellular polymeric compounds such as polysaccharides and proteins derived from microalgae and other microorganisms 6 however the settling of biological sludge in saline environments involves several problems 7 8 among the causes of this phenomenon is the greater density of salt water compared to fresh water this generates buoyancy thrusts that resist the gravimetric decantation of the sludge this drawback can be overcome by using aerobic granular sludge technology as demonstrated in a recent study by campo and di bella 4 secondly the high salinity in wastewater causes a considerable increase in the osmotic pressure between the liquid bulk and the intracellular content this implies a strong concentration gradient between what is contained within the cellular membranes of microorganisms and the mixed liquor due to this concentration gradient to rebalance the external osmotic pressure microorganisms activate a liquid transport mechanism from the inside of their cells towards the liquid bulk this inevitably leads to cells plasmolysis and to the death of the microorganisms normally present in the wastewater 9 for these reasons chemical physical treatments are nowadays the elective treatments for the removal of organic recalcitrant and inorganic substance from industrial wastewater 10 12 these treatments are widely used for their high purification efficiency and adaptability to toxic and recalcitrant compounds even though they involve higher opex costs mainly due to the use of chemical reagents and the disposal of chemical sludge produced during the various treatment phases 13 one of the most widely used chemical physical processes for treating industrial wastewater is coagulation flocculation 14 16 coagulation flocculation is a chemical physical treatment that allows thanks to the addition of specific chemical agents the precipitation of non settling colloidal suspended solids and also of very fine sedimentable solids difficult to eliminate with a simple physical treatment due to their extremely low sedimentation rate 17 19 this treatment can also represent a preliminary phase in a more complex chain that involves refining processes of adsorption and oxidation 20 the treatment is divided into three different phases coagulation flocculation and sedimentation the coagulation phase thanks to the addition of coagulant substances aims to destabilize the colloidal suspensions by breaking down the repulsive forces due to the presence of charges of the same sign on the surface of colloids at this point these particles can interact with each other by agglomerating themselves first in micro flakes and then in flakes of gradually increasing size for a correct coagulation an energetic mixing is required inside the coagulation compartment allowed by stirrers that rotate at high speed flocculation consists in the further destabilization of colloidal substances and above all in the agglomeration of destabilized particles that give rise to micro flakes and later to flakes that settle easily while a vigorous stirring is favorable in the coagulation phase in the flocculation phase the stirring speed must be neither too low nor too high in order to avoid sedimentation and breakage of the flake in order for the flocculation to occur it is necessary to add to the water substances called coagulation adjuvants or flocculants 21 once flocs have reached such dimensions as to allow their precipitation the last sedimentation phase begins in which a calm tank allows them to settle and then be removed from the water among the literature studies concerning the in continuous coagulation flocculation treatment of industrial wastewater it is possible to mention the one conducted by suarez et al 22 this study evaluates the suitability of coagulation flocculation and flotation processes in the pre treatment of hospital type industrial wastewater at pilot scale continuous processes offer evident advantages such as the possibility of treating with the same useful volume higher flow rates and ensuring a continuous production of the treated effluent eliminating the dead times that are intrinsic in batch treatments in the case of continuous coagulation flocculation the optimization of discontinuous process jar test depends on other parameters such as hydrodynamics linked to the mixing method and the geometry of the tanks these parameters must limit the retroflux and entrapment phenomena of the developing particles 23 the main objective of this study is the evaluation of coagulation flocculation purifying efficiency for the removal of pollutants present in the slops in particular treatment efficiency was evaluated in terms of removal of total suspended solids tss chemical oxygen demand cod total organic carbon toc total petroleum hydrocarbon tph and heavy metals present in process sludge the main elements of innovativeness of the study are i continuous bench pilot tests for the optimization of coagulation flocculation ii the treatment of real industrial wastewater such as slops the main hypothesis of the present work was that by applying a continuous configuration for coagulation flocculation of real industrial slop wastewater coupled with a specific deflector system improve the overall pollutants removal efficiencies of the coagulation flocculation treatment actually continuous feeding is typical for full scale coagulation flocculation treatments 24 therefore the novelty of the present experimentation consists in the realization of a laboratory scale plant fed in continuous as a proof of concept for up scaling the proposed layout this constitutes an intermediate step between the process performed in batch useful for establishing the optimal parameters and the process performed in real scale plants in fact the coagulation flocculation process is often based on the results of the jar tests which do not take into account the effects of a continuous treatment to date lab scale coagulation flocculation studies are commonly performed in batch whereas as the main application of coagulation flocculation treatment systems at full scale operate in continuous the present study aims at reproduce the continuous treatment at lab scale thus representing a direct continuation of a previous work of the same research group 3 in this sense the observation of the phenomenon within the bench scale model can be useful to highlight the hydrodynamic characteristics of the process inevitably linked to the treatment efficiency especially when oily water is treated 2 materials and methods the present experimental study concerns the treatment of slops collected from tankers used to transport petroleum products and operating in the port of augusta sr italy for the treatment of this industrial wastewater a laboratory scale bench scale system operating continuously has been developed 2 1 characterization of wastewater in order to determine the main polluting parameters that the coagulation flocculation treatment must remove table 1 shows the characterization of slops used in this study sampled in two different moments and indicated as sample 1 and sample 2 the measurement of each parameter was repeated several times in order to obtain a data as real as possible and the value shown in the table is the average of the values obtained in the different tests due to the high salinity conditions the cod was measured by chemical titration with the addition of mercury sulfate in order to eliminate chloride interference the measures of ammonium and of all anions were carried out by means of ionic chromatography by ics dionex 1100 the total organic carbon toc was measured by means of thermos catalytic oxidation with a high temperature toc vcsh analyzer that also provides the total carbon tc and the inorganic carbon ic finally the tphs concentrations were measured using a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector gc fid agilent 6890 n after extraction of tphs from samples with hexane the analysis of the table shows that the organic substance and hydrocarbons are the main pollutants present in the washing waters in the last column of the table the limits for the discharge of industrial wastewater into surface waters are reported the legislative limits are contained in table 3 of annex 5 to the third part of the legislative decree 152 06 25 bearing in mind that the rule 11 of annex iv of the marpol protocol 73 78 26 regulates wastewater discharge into the sea 2 2 choice of optimal dosage of coagulant and flocculant as mentioned above coagulation flocculation requires the addition of chemicals to be mixed with water for this reason it was necessary to choose the type and dose of reagents coagulant and flocculant and the rotation speed of the stirrers within the different compartments this choice derives from the results obtained in the study by di bella et al 3 in a discontinuous coagulation flocculation treatment conducted on the same type of wastewater at bench scale operational conditions within the present experimental campaign subsequent jar tests performed adopting the same types and doses of chemical reagents further validated the results produced by this study these tests also confirmed that aluminum sulphate al2 so4 3 18h2o tends to be the most performing coagulant even more if coupled with the polyelectrolyte a57 which is the anionic form of the flocculant as referenced by rastelli et al 27 and costantino et al 28 obviously the choice of reagents used in a chemical treatment also depends on economic factors being the result of a cost benefit analysis in the present study however there are no elements of economic nature regarding the costs of chemical compounds as a detailed dissertation of this is present in the aforementioned work by di bella et al 3 to which this study refers for the choice of reagents to be used table 2 shows the combinations of doses of coagulant and flocculant used in the jar tests performed both for raw slop waters and for those previously de oiled in both samples 1 and 2 specifically the jar tests performed on de oiled slops confirmed that the removal efficiency of coagulation flocculation treatment increases as the coagulant concentrations increase on the other hand by increasing the dose of flocculant there are no significant improvements the jar tests performed on raw slop i e not previously de oiled have shown that the use of flocculant even though in small doses increases the separation speed of solid particles from the clarified consequently it was decided to add aluminum sulfate al2 so4 3 in the dose of 90 mg l and to limit the addition of anionic flocculant a57 at a dose of 1 mg l since the use of larger doses would be uneconomical on a large scale 2 3 sizing of the plant units the continuous coagulation flocculation process has been carried out on a laboratory scale following a preliminary design and a maximum dimensioning the flow rate of slop water to be treated was set at about 3 l h as regards the sizing of the units necessary for the coagulation flocculation process the choice of operating parameters and of stirring speed of each specific process phase is based on hypotheses related to the hydraulic retention time hrt and to the speed gradients necessary in the coagulation and flocculation processes the volume of the individual units was calculated to maintain the wastewater within the specific compartment for the fixed hrt through the simple and canonical relation 1 1 v q hrt where v is the volume of the compartment and q is the flow rate coagulation is a rapid process characterized by an energetic mixing that must allow the destabilization of the colloids charge and an initial aggregation of the particles coagulation compartment therefore was dimensioned in such a way as to have a speed gradient of the mechanical mixer equal to 500 s 1 and a contact time of 2 min generally in normal coagulation flocculation treatments the coagulation phase lasts between 30 s and 1 min however it should be emphasized that in the case of a bench scale model the literature ranges are often more extensive due to limitations of the same physical model compartment in any case the choice of a larger hrt with a subsequent greater volume of the sector involves a slightly more lasting process but without clearly negative effects on the contrary the volumetric increase has no economic impact in plants at this scale the coagulation compartment was then sized so that the wastewater remained inside for a holding time equal to the desired contact time with the dosed coagulant from the formula reported in eq 1 a volume of 100 ml was sized due to the small size of the coagulation compartment the energetic agitation of the wastewater was possible only using a magnetic stirrer rotating at a speed of 200 rpm flocculation on the other hand is the process during which through slow agitation the particles form flakes of gradually increasing dimensions for this reason it was decided a speed gradient of the mechanical mixer equal to 50 s 1 and a contact time of 30 min the flocculation compartment therefore was sized considering a hydraulic retention time of 30 min obtaining a volume of 1 5 liters the slow stirring inside the flocculation compartment was allowed by a mechanical vertical stirrer type velp rotating at a speed of 20 rpm equipped at the end with a fixed stainless steel blade with dimensions of 4 1 5 cm finally sedimentation or flotation depending on the type of wastewater fed whether pre treated or not represents the phase of calm in which the flakes settle on the bottom or float on the surface for the latter compartment with a detention time of 120 min a volume of 6 liters was obtained finally it was necessary to dimension the volumes of the tanks containing the coagulant and flocculant solutions so that the concentrations of chemical reagents established during the jar tests were present within the various compartments of the reactor as previously mentioned as a coagulant it was decided to use aluminum sulphate in a concentration of 90 mg l to maintain this concentration inside the coagulation compartment it was necessary to use a solution of al2 so4 3 in distilled water with a concentration of 562 5 mg l a reservoir of 2 liters of distilled water was used with 1 125 g of coagulant inside instead the anionic polyelectrolyte a57 in concentration of 1 mg l was used as flocculant to obtain this concentration inside the flocculation compartment it was necessary to use a solution of a57 in distilled water with a concentration of 5 55 mg l a reservoir of 2 5 liters of distilled water was then used with 13 9 ml of flocculant inside in table 3 the parameters used for sizing the various sections of the plant are reported 2 4 description of the experimental apparatus and process lay out the coagulation flocculation treatment consists in the succession of the coagulation and flocculation phases followed by sedimentation that remove most of the polluting substances and incorporate them in the sludge extracted from the bottom of the sedimentation compartment while the clarified treated flows from the surface through a light 29 in the present study the experimental observation of the coagulation flocculation process carried out for oily waters however has shown that the nature of this specific type of wastewater is such as to allow the removal of colloidal particles not only for sedimentation but also for flotation of floating flakes this is mainly due to the high concentration of oils and substances with a lower specific weight than water so they tend to float the pre formed flakes in this case therefore the sludge consisting of solids and oils is removed from the free surface of the water while the clarified is extracted from an under light within the flotation compartment for these reasons the experimental campaign conducted in this study focused on the creation of two different plant layouts fig 1 layout a in which the last section of the plant was used as a sedimentation tank layout b in which instead the last section of the plant was used as a floatation tank of course the slop fed in the two different plant layouts has different characteristics to maximize the capacity of the particles to settle or float depending on the case in particular in the first configuration the slop water was fed after a de oiling treatment inside a pre oil separation compartment separated from the plant in order to remove most of the present oils the raw slop was poured into this compartment and kept calm for a time equal to the holding time of the final sedimentation compartment during this phase most of the oils contained in the slop floated to the surface and were then removed with the aid of a steel ladle on the other hand in the second configuration the plant was fed with raw wastewater in order to allow the oils to float in the final flotation compartment bringing with them the solids and the main pollutants present in the slops fig 1 shows the four sampling sections named as below s1 input section for coagulation flocculation treatment i e the de oiled slop in layout a and the raw slop in layout b s2 section at the exit from the flocculation compartment s3 system exit section ssludge and spost float separated sludge in the final solid liquid separation phase respectively in sedimentation ssludge and flotation spost float furthermore during the various tests the particles present in the sedimentation flotation compartment tend to return to the flocculation one therefore in order to hinder or mitigate the hydrodynamic backscatter effects in both plant layouts it was decided to insert a deflector element between the flocculation compartment and the sedimentation flotation compartment to accommodate the exit of the aggregated particles from the flocculator and prevent its backflow therefore for each layout two different tests were performed with and without deflector for a total of four tests in particular in the first case the deflector was placed at an angle of 45 downwards to accommodate sedimentation while in the second case it was placed at an angle of 45 upwards to accommodate the flotation of oils and fats fig 2 shows the two system diagrams with the appropriate coding test a de oiled wastewater without deflector between flocculation and sedimentation test b de oiled wastewater with deflector between flocculation and sedimentation test c raw wastewater without deflector between flocculation and flotation test d raw wastewater with deflector between flocculation and flotation all experimental tests presented in the study were performed at room temperature this is because in a chemical physical treatment such as that of coagulation flocculation this parameter is difficult to control and the mixing due to the rotation of the mechanical blades determines a constant process temperature value regardless of the environmental conditions 3 results and discussion for all the analyzed pollutants this section reports the output values from each section of the system according to the denominations and symbolism shown in fig 1 it also proposes comparative histograms concerning pollutant removal efficiencies total between s1 and s3 and partial from section to section these efficiencies have been calculated by means of mass balances expressed by the relation 2 2 η sin sout sin 100 where sin is always section s1 which is the value of the pollutant in the slop at coagulation flocculation plant s inlet while sout is the value of the pollutant referring each time to section s2 partial or to section s3 total 3 1 effect of oil removal on raw wastewater as previously mentioned in the two tests carried out using the layout a of the plant test a and test b see fig 2a and b the slop was subjected to a preliminary de oiling treatment before being sent for the effective clarification treatment in this installation the preliminary de oiling treatment aimed at removing most of the oils present in the slop plays a fundamental role allowing to reduce the load of pollutants sent to the effective coagulation flocculation treatment table 4 shows that the initial phase of oil removal is able to reduce the concentration of pollutants taken into consideration during the experimentation in fact in this case the de oiled slop was less hard than the one started to coagulation in the subsequent tests test c and d in which the de oiling phase is not present in the raw slop wastewater the much higher particulate matter concentration expressed as tss undoubtedly influenced the coagulation flocculation treatment efficiencies in order to consider the above mentioned aspect and to avoid misunderstandings in the analysis of the results the authors compared the layouts two by two i e test a with test b and test c with test d in table 4 the data of the two independent samples are reported despite the high removal efficiencies allowed by the preliminary de oiling phase as shown in the table the values of all the pollutants are still much higher than the legislative limits for the spillage in the receiving water bodies especially for tph in light of the achieved results the oil removal treatment is configured exclusively as a preliminary step aimed at reducing the slop s polluting load which must necessarily be followed by a specific purification treatment basically given by chemical physical one in the following sub sections the results of the total as well as partial removal efficiency of the treatment chain calculated according to eq 2 are discussed these yields have been calculated considering as starting values those of the pollutants present in the de oiled or raw wastewater see fig 1 layout a or b respectively in particular the partial removal efficiency of the suspended solids of the organic matter and of the petroleum hydrocarbons are calculated according to 3 ηpart s1 s2 s1 100 whereas the total removal is obtained considering the system exit section 4 ηtot s1 s3 s1 100 3 2 removal of total suspended solids coagulation flocculation processes have been designed for promoting removal of suspended solids and colloids from wastewater which do not settle spontaneously typically removal of tss could be increased from 40 to 70 without coagulation up to 60 90 if a coagulant is used 28 in the case of the slop wastewaters considered in this work the suspended particles showed good settling properties both in the case of slop previously de oiled and in the case of raw slop fig 3 shows the variation of the concentrations and the removal performance of the dissolved and non settling fraction of the total solids in particular in order to quantify the correct evolution of the process the solids were determined only in the supernatant of each sample obviously only in the final section this data coincides with the real solids content of the clarified fig 3 highlights that in the case of raw wastewater the removal efficiency of solids after coagulation flocculation s2 is clearly improved by the deflector passing from a value of 97 without deflector to a value close to 100 with deflector the experiments showed in fact that the inclined element causes an attenuation of the sporadic retro flow effects induced by the static mixer located in the flocculation compartment conversely when a pre treated de oiled wastewater is considered the deflector tends to act at least partially as a trap therefore the combined effect of turbulence generated by the agitation inside the flotation compartment s2 and the obstacle constituted by the deflector itself causes a partial reverse flow from the sedimentation to the flocculation compartments this behavior explains the effective reduction of the efficiency from 93 to 91 induced by the deflector acting as a flow barrier nevertheless the total removal efficiencies were satisfactory in all configurations with a slightly higher percentage in the case of raw wastewater influent as a simple percentage effect due to the higher concentration of floating particles in the case of non pre treated slop these results show that aluminum sulphate is a suitable coagulant for the removal of suspended solids from salt water contaminated with hydrocarbons different results have instead been obtained by suarez et al 22 suggesting that in the treatment of hospital wastewater the removal efficiency of tss increases if they are coagulated with fecl3 while it decreases in the case in which al2 so 4 is used 3 3 removal of organic matter removal of cod was highly influenced by the fraction of total cod associated to particulate and soluble organic matter according to the results achieved for the total suspended solid the overall removal of the organic matter in the final section s3 was quite satisfactory looking at the data reported in fig 4 in fact it is possible to observe that outlet cod concentrations were near or below the limit values imposed by legislative decree 152 06 160 mg l specifically the figure shows the variation of cod concentrations and the partial removal efficiencies in the chosen control sections once again in the light of the two tests carried out with and without de oiled phase in the case of de oiled wastewater it is possible to observe that the highest cod removal efficiency is verified in presence of the deflector 89 rather than without deflector 57 confirming that in the latter case a retroflux phenomenon occurs similarly in the absence of the deflector it is plausible to hypothesize the generalized influence of turbulence caused by the agitator inside the flocculation compartment which hinders the correct aggregation of the particles in the flocculation compartment itself whose flakes in formation are more sensitive to the break the tests carried out with raw wastewater analyzed in fig 4b and d reveal that the deflector improves the removal efficiency inside the flocculation compartment confirming the results achieved for tss even though in this case the difference with tests conducted without a deflector is much smaller as the efficiency increases from 94 to 98 thanks to this element this is due to a lower density of the flakes in the raw slop that make them easily separable by flotation for this reason despite the higher removal rates in the s2 section the residual cod concentration is greater in tests conducted with raw wastewater however in terms of concentration at the end of the treatment chain section s3 the cod concentrations are lower in the test performed with pre treated de oiled effluent conducted with the help of the deflector in any case both plant layouts showed quite satisfactory cod removal efficiencies especially when compared to the literature data where the coagulation flocculation treatment allows cod removals around 70 22 in this context it must be emphasized that the saline and oily nature of wastewater influences the correct analytical characterization due to the effect of heterogeneous organic components especially in recalcitrant organic components and in the presence of emulsions in this framework to have further confirmation about the removal efficiency of organic matter the study completes the analysis with the determination of toc although the law does not regulate the total organic carbon limit value as it is possible to observe in fig 5 the results seem to be apparently different from those obtained with the cod basically in term of toc the removal efficiency inside the flocculation compartment s2 and at the outlet of the plant has highest values in the test performed without deflector in fact toc measurement is a more complete parameter taking into account all the particles present in the liquid bulk both isolated and aggregated or emulsified the presence of the deflector leads to an increase in the toc in the effluent when compared with the tests conducted without a deflector in particular the toc removal efficiency decreases from 65 to 60 in the case of pre treated slop while it remains around 98 in the case of raw slop 3 4 removal of total petroleum hydrocarbons to complete the analysis on the removal of organic particles this section discusses the effect of treatments on wastewater both de oiled and raw in terms of total petroleum hydrocarbons hereafter tph removal it is worthwhile to specify that a preliminary oil removal treatment eliminates almost all these pollutants since the oils are mainly composed of hydrocarbons nevertheless fig 6 shows that coagulation and flocculation have contributed substantially to an increase of the removal efficiencies with tph values in the outlet section below the legal limit 5 mg l imposed by marpol 73 78 law moreover as shown by the data reported in fig 6 the presence of the deflector contributes positively to the removal of tph however the analysis of concentration data in each section shows that the process of tph removal applied to raw wastewater requires the entire treatment chain for the almost complete removal of all the hydrocarbon particles thus to respect the law limit 5 mg l looking at the raw wastewater cases fig 6b shows that without deflector the tph removal is achieved after the coagulation and flocculation phases section s2 whereas the presence of the deflector gives rise to a lower efficiency see fig 6d nevertheless the efficiency of tph reduction is almost equal close to 100 with or without the deflector when the solid liquid separation phase is performed section s3 in the case of de oiled slop the presence of the deflector fig 6a and c leads to an increase in efficiency from 90 to values also this time close to 100 3 5 comparative evaluation of reactor hydrodynamics the above analysis carried out in terms of removal efficiency of tss cod toc and tph highlighted a general advantage in term of both hydrodynamic circulation and pollutant reduction efficiency induced by the deflector installed in the passage section between flocculator and flotation sedimentation in order to better understand the effectively efficiency of the process of pollutants removal it is worthwhile focus the attention on the concentrations at the end of the coagulation flocculation separation chain the above analysis in fact suggests that the results are affected by the preliminary phase of oil removal to this aim in fig 7 the discharge concentrations of the entire treatment chain for all the experiments here conducted are reported specifically it is possible to observe that the tests carried out in the presence of a deflector are characterized by higher efficiency looking at the fig 7 in fact it can be observed that tests b and d have overall lower concentration values moreover it is worthwhile to underline that the pollutant concentrations at the outlet sections of the plant have always been lower than the limit imposed by the law for discharge into surface waters the only exceptions are registered for the cod parameter without deflectors in order to complete the critical analysis of the data it is also useful to investigate the fate of the aluminum dosed with the coagulant even though metals do not constitute a polluting element in slops in the coagulation flocculation process an excess of aluminum sulphate metal salts could lead to a production of an outflow discharge not respecting the law limits similar problems involve the accumulation in the chemical sludge of the aluminum used interestingly the presence of aluminum in the purified wastewater is ruled by restrictive limit on the other hand the aluminum contained in the solid matrix of the sewage sludge is more flexible since actual legislative decree does not report a limit value for this parameter anyway as pointed out by verma et al 20 the aluminum concentration in the sludge is an indirect measure of the adequate dosage of coagulant therefore in the present research the aluminum concentrations contained in the process sludge was analyzed in order to assess the effective dosage and the efficiency of coagulating effect at the end of the various tests the amount of sludge extracted by sedimentation from the tests in which slop was previously de oiled is roughly half if compared to the quantity of sludge extracted by flotation from the test that treated the slop without a preliminary phase of oil removal fig 8 shows concentration of aluminum in sludge extracted from the experiments and the concentration of aluminum in the clarified outlet flow section s3 specifically in the figure the highest concentration of aluminum in the sludge is observed in the de oiled slop layout a in the presence of the deflector element in this test there was a much higher concentration than in the sludge extracted in the test in which slop contained oils layout b always in the presence of the deflector element therefore even though the amount of sludge extracted from the tests on de oiled slop is lower the amount of aluminum actively used was certainly greater in the test carried out on the slop previously de oiled and where it was inserted the deflector element it is worthwhile to specify that the amount of aluminum dosed to the plant in the form of al2 so4 3 was the same for all four tests so a greater concentration of the metal in the sludge indicates a greater coagulation efficiency in the test on de oiled slop with the use of the deflector therefore from the mass balance there is a lower presence of aluminum in the clarified fig 8b in tests carried out without the deflector even though the concentration of aluminum in the sludge is high in the de oiled case fig 8a case a and low in raw case fig 8a case c the mass of aluminum is extremely low in both cases so it is expected that high level of dosed aluminum will exit the plant together with the clarified this is confirmed by the results reported in fig 8b this specific behavior can be attribute to the absence of the deflector responsible to hinder the correct sedimentation flotation of the sludge and causing concentrations higher than the limit values lgs d 152 2006 on the other hand in both tests carried out with the deflector on slop previously de oiled and on slop with oils according to some literature findings see among others alimoradi et al 29 the aluminum concentration in the clarified is lower than legislative limits concluding the dose of aluminum does not affect the coagulation process rather the efficiency of the pollutant reduction is influenced by the hydrodynamic condition induced by the presence of the deflector or by the presence of pre treatments i e de oiled process the aluminum dosage was in fact given by the classical quantities of the jar test reported in literature 4 conclusions the novelty of this study consists in the optimization of jar test results by analyzing a continuous bench scale plant for the treatment of recalcitrant slop wastewater in general the experimentation confirms good removal performance the uses of continuous plant eventually coupled with a specific deflector system underline further interesting results the removal efficiency of the sst has always settled on values greater than 90 with the exception of the test carried out on the de oiled slop without the use of the deflector element while the efficiency of tph removal was even almost close to 100 the removal of the organic substance in terms of cod and toc has instead shown lower returns however this data cannot limit process applicability since the organic substance anyway respects the discharge limits in the presence of the deflector this element mitigates retroflux effects due to which the solid particles from the sedimentation flotation compartment fall within the flocculation compartment the analysis of aluminum presence in the treated wastewater and in the sludge extracted from the plant at the end of the various tests shows that the presence of the deflector allows reaching concentrations of al in the clarified water below legislative limits in both plant layouts in particular the lower output concentrations occur in the case of wastewater supply with oils however the higher concentration of aluminum in the sludge extracted at the end of the test performed on slop previously de oiled indicates a greater coagulation efficiency all these observations suggest that the optimization of coagulation flocculation treatment performed on slop wastewaters is possible treating de oiled wastewater with the help of a deflector element that allows improving the overall hydrodynamic process declaration of competing

14091,nitrate removal from groundwater by donnan dialysis involves the dynamics of a multi component solution transport kinetics of nitrate and the accompanying anions sulfate and bicarbonate were investigated with three synthetic groundwater solutions the effects of the water quality and of the anion exchange membrane type selemion amv neosepta amx and fumasep fab were examined using a donnan dialyzer it was found that water quality had only negligible effect on nitrate and sulfate transport through the amv membrane this was indicated by similar concentration decays of these anions with time as well as by comparable mass transfer coefficients obtained in the three water qualities tested additionally very close nitrate and sulfate removal rates were obtained with the amv and amx membranes bicarbonate transport was the least efficient compared to the nitrate and sulfate it was strongly impacted by both the water quality and the membrane type the bicarbonate transport increased with augmentation of its molar fraction relative to the total anions in the solution overall the results points to the high potential of donnan dialysis for treating contaminated nitrate groundwaters keywords dialyzer ion exchange membrane transport kinetics bicarbonate sulfate 1 introduction nitrate contamination is a worldwide problem mostly caused by human activities such as excessive use of fertilizers and poor sewage systems nitrate can cause methemoglobinemia and is associated with thyroid dysfunction 1 2 surveys across the middle east found a significant number of aquifers with nitrate levels far exceeding the 50 mg l who guideline 3 5 in israel more than a half of all the disqualified drinking water wells were excluded due to nitrate contamination 6 in europe us and new zealand despite the implementation of environmental programs for sustainable nitrate management there are groundwater sources with nitrate levels exceeding 50 mg l 7 9 there are five common techniques for nitrate removal from contaminated water including ion exchange iex reverse osmosis ro electrodialysis ed and biological and chemical denitrification these techniques are comprehensively reviewed elsewhere 10 13 donnan dialysis dd is an emerging technique having the potential to address the nitrate problem in contaminated waters 14 22 in donnan dialysis nitrate migrates across an anion exchange membrane to a highly concentrated stripping receiver solution 23 the main advantages of the donnan process are low energy requirement and simple operation the major drawback as in the case of iex ro and ed techniques is the need to treat the highly concentrated receiver stream the high saline receiver waste stream is unique as it has the same anionic composition as the treated water but the only cation is sodium proposed methods for treating the dd waste include biological denitrification 24 26 and electro reduction 27 ion exchange membrane type and water matrix are among the parameters that affect the transport of target ions by donnan dialysis 15 17 19 20 28 29 yet nitrate removal by dd was examined only in tap water 16 21 22 and deionized water solutions 17 19 20 groundwater contains various constituents such as bicarbonate chloride sodium calcium and magnesium although the transport of nitrate in multi ionic mixtures has been studied 15 18 it was not investigated in groundwater compositions in multi component solutions different transport efficiencies were reported for various ionic species indicating that accompanying ions affect the transport of the target ion for example a transfer rate of nitrate sulfate bicarbonate was reported by wisniewski et al 2006 18 while the equilibrium concentrations in the feed were in the order of bicarbonate nitrate sulfate in a study performed with sulfate bicarbonate and bromide bromate similar removal efficiencies were obtained for sulfate and bicarbonate in the presence of bromide whereas bicarbonate removal was slower in the presence of bromate 29 it was concluded that the presence of large size and high valence accompanying ions reduce the removal of the target ion 17 additionally a high transport rate of the accompanying ions decrease the target ion removal 30 the objectives of the present research were to examine the feasibility of nitrate removal from contaminated groundwater by donnan dialysis the effects of the water quality and anion exchange membrane aem type on nitrate removal were examined the transport kinetics of nitrate as well as that of the accompanying anions sulfate and bicarbonate was determined and correlated with the water quality and membrane structure 2 theoretical model simplified engineering models characterizing donnan dialysis separations of

mono and di valent anions xi z and m accompanying cations xjz under mass transfer control with nacl as the receiver solution are described herein it was shown that the overall kinetic coefficient of donnan dialysis is determined by the sum of the resistance related to ion diffusion through the membrane and the resistance related to the mass transfer from the solution bulk to the membrane interface mass transfer control is promoted by relatively low solutions concentrations low mass transfer coefficients and high ion diffusivities 32 mass transfer was the dominant mechanism at the

target ion x i z w 1 in mono and di valent multi component systems and hence to determine the mass transfer coefficient according to eqs 6 and 7 it should be noted that the level of nitrate sulfate and bicarbonate adsorption onto the aems was negligible due to the high nacl concentration in the receiver solution therefore adsorption was not incorporated in the above equations target ion

while the ion exchange capacities and water contents are different table 1 3 3 feed water quality nitrate transport in multi ionic mixtures simulating nitrate polluted groundwater was tested using the amv membrane at reynolds number re of 2155 with 100 mm nacl as the receiver solution the compositions of the synthetic groundwater solutions are listed in table 2 these water types were chosen to represent a range of groundwater qualities originated from different geographic regions i e middle east 10 europe 37 and north america 38 the synthetic groundwater solutions were prepared by dissolving analytical grade nano3 mgso4 7h2o nahco3 cacl2 2h2o nacl and na2so4 salts in deionized di water experiments designed to test the effect of the molar fraction between bicarbonate and the total anions on the bicarbonate transport were conducted in w1 solution at ph 7 8 in these experiments the concentrations of the nitrate calcium magnesium and chloride were similar to that of w1 solution while the concentrations of the sulfate 0 99 3 85 mm bicarbonate 1 00 9 90 mm and sodium 5 28 11 38 mm were changed the composition of the various solutions denoted as w1 b w1 i are listed in table 3 experiments were also conducted in di water solution at which nitrate 1 5 mm sulfate 1 0 mm and bicarbonate 3 8 mm were present as a sole component in the feed solution the concentration of each anion listed above in parentheses is similar to that of w1 solution all experiments were repeated up to 15 times the stadanard deviation between the replicate experimens is presented as error

spectrophotometer method 8051 bicarbonate was analyzed using standard methods 2320b 39 4 results 4 1 nitrate bicarbonate and sulfate removal in different groundwater types nitrate transport in synthetic groundwaters listed in table 2 was tested using the amv membrane the decay in the normalized nitrate concentration with time was found to be similar in three water types tested fig 2a indicating that the water composition did not significantly affect the no3 transport the transport of the accompanying anions sulfate and bicarbonate during the dialytic process is shown in figs 2b c and 3 similarly to the nitrate the sulfate transport seems to be unaffected by the presence of the accompanying ions fig 2b overall the removal of the bicarbonate followed the decreasing order of w1 w2 w3 fig 2c i e the higher transfer from the feed was obtained in w1 followed by w2 and w3 among the three anions present in the synthetic groundwater solutions very close nitrate and sulfate removal rates were obtained in all water types tested yet less efficient bicarbonate transport was observed fig 3 the trends described above are manifested by the mass transfer coefficients of the three anions listed in table 4 the mtc values were calculated as described in section 2 it is seen that the mtc values of the nitrate and sulfate are comparable in the three water types at k 0 07 and 0 06 m h respectively despite the variation in the tested water qualities however the mtc value of bicarbonate in w1 was found to be about 40 higher than in w2 and w3 the similar behavior of the nitrate and sulfate ions in the three water types may be explained by their equivalent ion diffusivity ratios 1 50 and 1 45 for nitrate and sulfate respectively 40 this could be due to the amv membrane structure which consists of strongly basic quaternary amines functionalized polystyrene copolymer and pyridine groups at the interface of the membrane 33 41 strongly basic ion exchangers have preference to sulfate while polystyrene strong base anion resins exhibit higher selectivity toward nitrate 42 the lower transfer of the bicarbonate as compared to nitrate and sulfate may stem from the nature of the chemical bonds these ions form in aqueous solutions 43 44 nitrate and sulfate may be defined as weakly hydrogen bonded ions while bicarbonate forms more structured bonds with water molecules resulting in hindered transport as compared to nitrate and sulfate 45 most often the efficiency of ions transport through an ion exchange membrane is correlated to the hydrated size and charge of the ions for example rozanska et al 46 explained the efficient removal of nitrate and sulfate by the small hydrated radius of the former and higher affinity of the latter to the aem due to its charge the lowest rate of bicarbonate transport through an aem membrane was attributed to its large hydrated radius as compared to nitrate and sulfate the hydrated radii of nitrate sulfate and bicarbonate are compared in table 5 confirming differences in reported values for each anion it is also stated that the affinity of bicarbonate to ion exchangers is close to that of chloride and lower than that of nitrate and sulfate 47 48 analysis of the molar fraction between bicarbonate and the total anions in w1 w3 solutions revealed that more bicarbonate was removed from the feed as the molar fraction increased table 6 a similar observation was reported by wiśniewski et al 29 another parameter that may influenced the bicarbonate transport in the three water qualities is the ph of the solution in order to further explore the effect of the molar fraction of bicarbonate and total anions the composition of w1 solution was varied by changing the bicarbonate and sulfate concentrations while maintaining a constant ph of 7 8 table 3 the results are displayed in fig 4 a b the bicarbonate removal from the feed solution manifested by the mtc values increased with augmentation of the molar fraction between the bicarbonate and the total anions the amount removed δ increased by a factor of about 20 from 0 35 mm at a molar fraction of 0 1 to 6 53 mm at molar fraction of 0 55 fig 4a these results may be explained by the increase in the bicarbonate concentration in the membrane interface with the rise in the molar fraction of the bicarbonate fig 4b higher concentration on the membrane wall results in greater transport of bicarbonate from the feed as reflected by an increase in the mtc fig 4a further evaluation of the effect of the water quality on the transport of the three anions in donnan dialysis was conducted by comparing their transport in di water solution versus w1 section 4 2 and by testing two additional anion exchange membranes section 4 3 4 2 removal of the anions in w1 versus di water the mass transfer coefficients of nitrate sulfate and bicarbonate in w1 were compared to the values obtained in experiments conducted in di water solution in these experiments each anion was present as a sole component in the feed solution the results are shown in fig 5 in the experiments conducted in di water the initial concentration of each anion was similar to that present in w1 solution for both the nitrate and sulfate the mtc values obtained in the di water are within the experimental error of the mtc values found in w1 solution up to 10 these results are consistent with the results obtained in w1 w3 solutions where nitrate and sulfate removal was not significantly impacted by the groundwater composition nonetheless the mtc value of bicarbonate in w1 solution was lower than that in di water indicating the accompanying ions hindered its transfer zhao et al 30 attributed the effect of accompanying ions on the transfer of a target ion to a combination of the competition for the functional groups inside the membrane and the dialytic kinetics they concluded that a high transport rate of the accompanying ions to the receiver reduces the target ion removal 4 3 removal of nitrate bicarbonate and sulfate using different membranes in order to determine whether the efficiency of anions removal is specific to a membrane type experiments were conducted in w1 solution using the amx and fab membranes the results were compared to the results obtained with the amv membrane fig 6 as seen all three membranes exhibited similar removal of nitrate 80 after 6 h overall the performance of the amv and amx membranes with regard to the sulfate and bicarbonate was found to be close nonetheless the transfer of these two ions was hindered using the fab membrane this is attributed to diffusion control transport of the bicarbonate and sulfate in the fab membrane as compared to mass transfer controlled mechanism in the other two membranes similar behavior was found for phosphate 32 the variation in the transport mechanism may be explained by the difference in the water content of the membranes the amv and amx membranes have similar water content while the fab membrane water content is lower table 1 a lower water content indicates that a membrane contains more cross linking resulting in lower ion exchange capacity 17 it is evident that the fab membrane with the lower water content and lower ion exchange capacity table 1 exhibited less efficient transport of bicarbonate and sulfate the higher cross linking may also explain the reduced transport of sulfate as compared to nitrate using the fab membrane as it results in steric hindrance of the tetrahedral sulfate structure as compared to the planar nitrate structure 55 the transport of the bicarbonate from the feed solution lowers the ph and the total alkalinity of the treated water accordingly the ph of the receiver solution increases along with the total alkalinity such changes may affect the end use of the treated groundwater as well as the treatment options available for the receiver waste stream unlike nitrate sulfate has no primary standard for drinking water or aquatic life high sulfate levels exert a laxative effect and also tend to corrode metal plumbing sulfate level is limited to 250 mg l in drinking water who and us epa guidelines based on aesthetic effects i e taste and odor removal of sulfate by donnan dialysis along with the nitrate necessarily improves the product water quality 5 conclusions a simplified kinetic approach to donnan dialysis of multi component solutions simulating groundwater compositions was demonstrated the extent of the removal and the mass transfer coefficients indicated that groundwater composition in the tested range had little impact on the nitrate and sulfate transport in amv and amx membranes bicarbonate transport on the other hand was found to be sensitive to the water matrix and membrane type the fab membrane showed a decreased transport of sulfate as well as of bicarbonate while maintaining similar nitrate removal overall the results of the study demonstrated the potential for treating nitrate

14091,nitrate removal from groundwater by donnan dialysis involves the dynamics of a multi component solution transport kinetics of nitrate and the accompanying anions sulfate and bicarbonate were investigated with three synthetic groundwater solutions the effects of the water quality and of the anion exchange membrane type selemion amv neosepta amx and fumasep fab were examined using a donnan dialyzer it was found that water quality had only negligible effect on nitrate and sulfate transport through the amv membrane this was indicated by similar concentration decays of these anions with time as well as by comparable mass transfer coefficients obtained in the three water qualities tested additionally very close nitrate and sulfate removal rates were obtained with the amv and amx membranes bicarbonate transport was the least efficient compared to the nitrate and sulfate it was strongly impacted by both the water quality and the membrane type the bicarbonate transport increased with augmentation of its molar fraction relative to the total anions in the solution overall the results points to the high potential of donnan dialysis for treating contaminated nitrate groundwaters keywords dialyzer ion exchange membrane transport kinetics bicarbonate sulfate 1 introduction nitrate contamination is a worldwide problem mostly caused by human activities such as excessive use of fertilizers and poor sewage systems nitrate can cause methemoglobinemia and is associated with thyroid dysfunction 1 2 surveys across the middle east found a significant number of aquifers with nitrate levels far exceeding the 50 mg l who guideline 3 5 in israel more than a half of all the disqualified drinking water wells were excluded due to nitrate contamination 6 in europe us and new zealand despite the implementation of environmental programs for sustainable nitrate management there are groundwater sources with nitrate levels exceeding 50 mg l 7 9 there are five common techniques for nitrate removal from contaminated water including ion exchange iex reverse osmosis ro electrodialysis ed and biological and chemical denitrification these techniques are comprehensively reviewed elsewhere 10 13 donnan dialysis dd is an emerging technique having the potential to address the nitrate problem in contaminated waters 14 22 in donnan dialysis nitrate migrates across an anion exchange membrane to a highly concentrated stripping receiver solution 23 the main advantages of the donnan process are low energy requirement and simple operation the major drawback as in the case of iex ro and ed techniques is the need to treat the highly concentrated receiver stream the high saline receiver waste stream is unique as it has the same anionic composition as the treated water but the only cation is sodium proposed methods for treating the dd waste include biological denitrification 24 26 and electro reduction 27 ion exchange membrane type and water matrix are among the parameters that affect the transport of target ions by donnan dialysis 15 17 19 20 28 29 yet nitrate removal by dd was examined only in tap water 16 21 22 and deionized water solutions 17 19 20 groundwater contains various constituents such as bicarbonate chloride sodium calcium and magnesium although the transport of nitrate in multi ionic mixtures has been studied 15 18 it was not investigated in groundwater compositions in multi component solutions different transport efficiencies were reported for various ionic species indicating that accompanying ions affect the transport of the target ion for example a transfer rate of nitrate sulfate bicarbonate was reported by wisniewski et al 2006 18 while the equilibrium concentrations in the feed were in the order of bicarbonate nitrate sulfate in a study performed with sulfate bicarbonate and bromide bromate similar removal efficiencies were obtained for sulfate and bicarbonate in the presence of bromide whereas bicarbonate removal was slower in the presence of bromate 29 it was concluded that the presence of large size and high valence accompanying ions reduce the removal of the target ion 17 additionally a high transport rate of the accompanying ions decrease the target ion removal 30 the objectives of the present research were to examine the feasibility of nitrate removal from contaminated groundwater by donnan dialysis the effects of the water quality and anion exchange membrane aem type on nitrate removal were examined the transport kinetics of nitrate as well as that of the accompanying anions sulfate and bicarbonate was determined and correlated with the water quality and membrane structure 2 theoretical model simplified engineering models characterizing donnan dialysis separations of

mono and di valent anions xi z and m accompanying cations xjz under mass transfer control with nacl as the receiver solution are described herein it was shown that the overall kinetic coefficient of donnan dialysis is determined by the sum of the resistance related to ion diffusion through the membrane and the resistance related to the mass transfer from the solution bulk to the membrane interface mass transfer control is promoted by relatively low solutions concentrations low mass transfer coefficients and high ion diffusivities 32 mass transfer was the dominant mechanism at the

14092,this study presents the application of resource recovery from domestic wastewater such as irrigation water structural extracellular polymeric substances eps and polyhydroxyalkanoates phas the resource recovery system consisted of an aerobic granular sludge ags reactor processing domestic wastewater and an external membrane reactor receiving the ags effluent the ags effluent contained large numbers of biomass patches detached from the granular sludge therefore the external membrane served to eliminate the biomass patches and individual bacteria from the ags effluent the permeate of the membrane reactor was compared with the national irrigation water standards the results showed that the membrane effluent was suitable to be used as irrigation water but the boron parameter should be checked for long term irrigation extracellular polysaccharides recovered from the granular sludge were characterized as structural eps the analyses showed that pha accumulating organisms namely uncultured candidatus competibacter sp and competibacteraceae were dominant in the ags reactor and the pha content of the ags was approximately 10 when operated under high organic loading rate conditions phas therefore may also be obtained from ags for the management of membrane concentrate and zero waste discharge approach it is recommended to investigate the recovery possibilities of structural eps and pha biopolymers from the membrane concentrate further because the effluent of ags contained mostly biomass patches detached from granular sludge keywords aerobic granular sludge irrigation water resource recovery structural extracellular polymeric substances eps polyhydroxyalkanoates phas 1 introduction the recovery of water energy and nutrient resources from municipal wastewater provides a promising solution to a number of prevalent economic environmental and social issues 1 first water recycling started with desalination processes in the 1970 s 2 and was then applied to industrial wastewater 3 membrane technology has made water recycling feasible by decreasing the cost however the concentrate of the membrane reactor can be a challenge that needs to be managed therefore the membrane concentrate should be carefully managed for recovery purposes by selecting proper pre treatment units nowadays forward osmosis fo based processes present a novel technology that may simultaneously produce high quality effluents and pre concentrated wastewater for anaerobic treatment to facilitate the recovery of energy water and nutrients however issues of salinity accumulation membrane fouling and anaerobic treatment integration have not been adequately addressed and limit the practical application of these hybrid systems 1 in the last decade wastewater has become a resource rather than a pollutant and wastewater treatment plants wwtp are described as resource recovery systems rrs 4 researches showed that phosphorus 5 bioplastics 4 biopolymers 6 metals 7 and even cellulose 8 might be recovered from wastewater aerobic granular sludge ags technology has been an innovative technology in wastewater treatment ags has numerous advantages such as simultaneous carbon nitrogen and phosphorus removal in a single reactor smaller footprint and less energy requirement when compared with conventional activated sludge systems 9 pronk et al 10 demonstrated that different types of biopolymers can be extracted from ags depending on the microbial community cultivated recently sialic acids have been discovered in the extracellular polymeric substances eps of seawater adapted ags 11 a better understanding of the eps matrix will lead to improved strategies for resource recovery in wastewater treatment systems 12 13 the cultivation the micro and macro structure and the long term operation of two ags systems fed with high and medium strength domestic wastewater were presented in detail in our previous study 14 the study highlighted the effects of large concentrations of suspended solids in raw domestic wastewater the results showed that a large concentrations of suspended solids in raw domestic wastewater have a positive effect on granule size and settling properties of the ags b they can be removed by direct settling inside the reactor and adhesion onto granules and c they affect the detachment of biomass together with high shear force applied in the reactors this study focuses on a novel resource recovery approach by which irrigation water structural eps and polyhydroxyalkanoates phas might be recovered the resource recovery system consisted of an ags reactor processing domestic wastewater and an external membrane reactor receiving ags effluent the study evaluated the possibilities of recovering the membrane permeate as irrigation water and recovering structural eps and phas from the granular sludge and even biomass in the membrane concentrate 2 material and methods 2 1 wastewater characterization wastewater was collected from istanbul university cerrahpasa campus and originated from the engineering faculty technical sciences high school and the main refectory wastewater was collected three times a week and stored at 4 c before being fed to the first ags reactor r1 in addition raw wastewater taken to another storage tank was settled at least for 2 h to remove all settleable solids and used as feed for the second ags reactor r2 metals mentioned in the national irrigation water standards were analyzed only once if they were lower than the values in the standards the analyses of boron iron and copper were repeated three times table 1 includes the detailed characterization of the raw and settled wastewater 2 2 reactors the first unit in the system was an ags reactor two sbrs were operated in parallel the first one with raw wastewater r1 and the second one with settled wastewater r2 the reactors were column type reactors with 28 l of working volume and were operated for 500 days during the last five months of operation stable and mature granules were obtained and the effluents of ags reactors were separately fed to an external membrane reactor the membrane reactor was a lab scale unit with 5 l of working volume a microfiltration membrane was used as mf005 microdyn nadir gmbh germany 2 3 analytical methods effluent samples from the ags reactors were analyzed after filtering through glass fiber filter paper millipore ap40 to eliminate the ss content the following parameters were determined according to the standard methods 15 cod bod5 tkn tp

instrument malvern instruments uk 2 4 extraction and characterization of eps the eps in long term monitoring was extracted using the method proposed by frølund et al 16 the eps extraction method and the polysaccharide ps and protein pn analysis are explained in detail in our previous study 14 granular biomass samples from the ags system were also analyzed for structural eps characterization thus the extracellular polymeric substances in particular exopolysaccharides exops were extracted from the sample using na2co3 and by heating as previously outlined by lin et al 6 the extract was added to a cacl2 solution in 1 1 ratio w v and incubated for a day for completion of crosslinking reactions next day the hydrogel beads were examined by e sem quanta feg 250 sem for comparison same treatments were performed for commercially available sodium alginate a2158 sigma ftir spectroscopy was performed to assess the chemical composition of the extracts perkin elmer spectrum 100 2 5 pha analysis phas accumulated in the biomass were determined using gas chromatography gc approximately 10 15 mg of lyophilized biomass was added to a vial next 2 ml of methanolysis solution and 2 ml of chloroform were added the vial was capped and sealed using parafilm it was heated using heater block at 100 c for 140 min 17 the vials were left to cool down to room temperature after heating one microliter of deionized water was added into the vial and vortexed for about 30 s three layers formed in the vial and the bottom layer was pipetted out into a vial containing a small amount of sodium sulfate na2so4 the vial was stirred until a clear solution was obtained the clear solution was transferred into a gc vial for quantification gc equipped with an auto injector was used to analyze the solution one microliter of the solution was injected into the column fitted to the gc the specification of gc column and settings are given in table s1 the samples were calibrated with standard curves prepared using p 3 hb co 3 hv sigma aldrich 2 6 microscopic examination and microbial community analyses mixed liquor samples were collected from r1 end of aerobic phase to visually verify the presence of phb accumulating organisms and confirm intracellular c storage in the form of lipid like inclusions mainly as phb thin smears were prepared from mixed liquor and smashed ags granules for phb staining samples were treated first with sudan black b staining phb and then with safranin o counter staining according to the manual by jenkins et al 18 microscopic examination of the samples was carried out using a light microscope olympus bx60 equipped with a ccd camera kameramgen3 next generation sequencing ngs based metagenomics were carried out to determine the microbial community the protocol includes the primer pair sequences for v3 and v4 regions of the 16s rrna that create a single amplicon of approximately 460 bp 19 the sequences were classified using bayesian classifier implanted in mother the reference and taxonomy files were adopted from the greengenes database 20 after the operational taxonomic units otus were selected and their taxonomic assignment was performed using the silva rdna database the otus were binned into phylotypes 14 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of ags reactors the cultivation structure and long term stability of ags fed with real domestic wastewater with high and medium concentration of suspended solids were investigated in our previous study 14 the ags reactors were operated for 500 days and operation in the last five months was considered as the stable period between day 350 and 500 the studies for recovery of irrigation water and biopolymers from the systems were carried out during the stable period the effluent concentrations of cod nh4 n and po4 3 p and removal efficiencies during the stable period are illustrated in fig 1 and summarized in table s2 cod removal efficiencies in both reactors were quite stable and identical 89 5 in this period and the corresponding effluent cod values from r1 and r2 were 98 71 mg l 1 and 86 38 mg l 1 respectively the removal efficiencies of nh4 n and po4 3 p in both reactors fluctuated unlike the cod removal efficiencies during the stable period because the influent concentrations of nh4 n and po4 3 p changed from 20 to 135 mg l 1 and from 3 to 21 mg l 1 respectively the total nitrogen tn removal efficiency in both reactors was 70 16 on an average and nox n production was negligible at the end of each cycle the removal efficiency of tp was 75 13 in r1 and 78 20 in r2 the removal efficiencies of nh4 n and po4 3 p were lower than those of tn and tp because of the hydrolysis of suspended solids proteins and organic phosphorus fig 1c e and f and table s2 the cycle studies were performed weekly for both reactors and the results of a typical cycle study on day 429 are given in fig 2 the profiles of cod nh4 n and po4 3 p in a cycle were considerably similar in both reactors at the end of the anaerobic period the concentrations increased because of wastewater feeding all three parameters had increasing trends during the first 60 min of the cycle because the reactors were fed continuously during that period under anaerobic conditions hydrolyses of particulate matter causing an increase in soluble cod and adsorption and or biochemical conversion by microorganisms resulting in a decrease in cod were the governing bio reactions during the anaerobic phase the net result of these processes was that the cod concentrations at the end of the anaerobic period in both reactors were 30 40 lower than the calculated values denoting that 30 40 of the cod was removed from the bulk liquid by microorganisms microbial community analyses showed that uncultured candidatus competibacter sp were the most dominated species in r1 35 and in r2 8 7 during the stable period table s3 additionally accumulibacter in both reactors was 4 5 of the total bacteria the presence of these bacteria may explain the lower cod and the slightly higher po4 3 p values obtained by the end of the anaerobic period in comparison to the calculated values slightly increased nh4 n concentrations compared to the calculated values at the end of the anaerobic period were attributed to the hydrolysis of particulate matter proteins the cod nh4 n and po4 3 p were removed at the same rate in the following aerobic phase because the main reaction was biological growth nitrification was negligible with almost no nox n production during the aerobic phase conventional nutrient removal processes nitrification denitrification and ebpr could not be achieved because the conventional nutrient removing organisms autotrophic nitrosomonas and nitrospira and heterotrophic phosphate accumulating accumulibacter did not get enriched in the ags reactors 14 3 2 water recovery for irrigation purposes the effluents of ags reactors had a high ss content due to the short settling time and high shear forces applied in the reactors an external membrane reactor mr was used to eliminate the effluent ss and recover the treated water for irrigation purposes the effluents of ags reactors were subjected to treatability studies in the mr thrice table 2 presents results of one of those treatability studies conducted on day 457 the mr was effective in eliminating ss and fecal coliform whereas no significant improvement was observed in cod nh4 n and po4 3 p removal efficiencies because a microfiltration membrane was used in the mr system the quality of the permeate from the mr was evaluated in comparison to the national irrigation water standards 41 the effluent of mr in r2 was only analyzed because the parameters analyzed in the mr effluents of both reactors were in the similar range except for cod and nh4 n table 2 the results are shown in table 3 the effluent of the ags mr system in r2 was classified as class a in terms of ph bod5 ss and fecal coliform parameters it should be noted that the removal efficiency of cod bod5 in both ags reactors was variable during the study therefore this parameter should be checked for irrigation purposes the chemical quality of the effluent was also evaluated for degree of restriction on irrigation use table 3 ii class irrigation water was provided because of the evaluation of electro conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds sodium adsorption rate sar na sprinkler irrigation only and cl parameters boron parameters were found to be quite high in both settled and treated wastewater classification of irrigation water by resistance of plants to boron mineral is given in table s4 according to table s4 boron resistant plants such as sugar beet alfalfa broad bean onion lettuce and carrot can be irrigated it was thought that the high concentration of boron may result from detergents used for cleaning boron containing cleaning products are marketed as environmentally friendly products however this study emphasizes that the boron parameters should be carefully checked if the treated wastewater is to be recovered as irrigation water and that the use of boron should be managed for future recovery of the treated wastewater heavy metals and toxic element concentrations in the settled wastewater were analyzed and compared with the permissible concentrations at the national agricultural irrigation water standard 41 table 4 most of the heavy metals and toxic element concentrations in the settled wastewater were lower than that of the standard however the copper concentration was determined to be higher than the permissible concentration therefore the copper concentration in the effluent of the ags mr system was measured and found to be 0 018 mg l 1 which was lower than that of the standard thirty percent of the feeding volume of mr was retained as a concentrate after membrane treatment as mentioned in the previous study 14 the suspended solids of the ags reactor effluent consisted of biomass patches detached from the granular sludge analyses of eps showed that the concentration of epsps in the concentrate was in a similar range with the concentration of epsps in the reactors table 2 pishgar et al 21 demonstrated that noteworthy similarity was observed between the relative abundances of genera enriched in the ags sample and discharged from the reactor therefore the resource recovery possibilities were evaluated in the biomass of the reactors 3 3 ags related biopolymers and their potential technical usage 3 3 1 structural eps of ags extracellular polysaccharides exops extracted from the granular sludge of the pilot scale ags system r1 fed with raw wastewater demonstrated gel forming capacity with divalent cations similar to alginates a combination of 2 ags exops in 2 cacl2 produced hydrogel beads as can be seen in fig 3 e sem analysis revealed further similarities in terms of the structure and appearance of the hydrogels formed by sodium alginate fig 3c and the ags exops fig 3d similar results were obtained with the exops extract from the granular sludge fed with settled wastewater r2 successful ionic hydrogel formation of the exops extracted from the granular sludge was in agreement with the results reported by lin et al 6 and sam and dulekgurgen 22 felz et al 23 and further provides clues of why ags systems perform better than conventional floccular activated sludge as systems in terms of biomass aggregation compaction and settling felz et al 23 employed various extraction methods to isolate eps from aerobic granular sludge samples and used the ionic hydrogel cross linked through ca 2 ions formation test to determine whether the extracted eps were structural polymers supporting granulation by contributing to gel formation they reported that among all extracts they tested only the eps extracted by the na2co3 and heating procedure and the exops fraction of that isolated by additional steps referred as ale extraction formed stable ionic hydrogel beads thus considered as the structural eps of the ags accordingly the exops extracted in this study from the ags of the pilot plant was addressed as the structural eps contributing to the granular structure of the biomass which displayed excellent settling properties in the compact treatment system results of the ftir spectroscopy are visually presented in fig 4 and comparatively summarized in table 5 the strong broad bands detected at 3600 3000 cm 1 region and the weaker ones at around 2900 cm 1 were assigned to oh and ch stretching vibrations respectively associated with hydrocarbons between 1700 and 1200 cm 1 region mainly associated with the presence of proteins the spectra of sodium alginate and the structural eps were different spectra of the structural eps displayed peaks at 1700 1600 cm 1 amide i 1600 1500 cm 1 amide ii and 1300 1200 cm 1 amide iii regions for the ags eps from r1 and r2 respectively peaks at 1627 and 1628 cm 1 were attributed to co stretching vibrations associated with proteins amide i region those detected at 1540 and 1532 cm 1 were attributed to nh bending and cn stretching vibrations in conh of proteins amide ii region the peaks at the amide iii region were weaker than those at the amide i and amide ii regions they were at 1237 and 1228 cm 1 and attributed to the cn stretching vibrations in proteins those peaks might be considered as implying the presence of some proteins in the structural eps of ags from r1 and r2 even though the extraction procedure applied in this study was same similar to those proposed for extraction of ale from ags 6 23 respectively alternatively they might be associated with some other functional groups as also reported by some researchers in their study on characterization of eps extracted from a soil isolate and relation between the eps composition and bio flocculation capacity yuan et al suggested that some of the stretches at the amide i ii iii regions attributed to proteins were possible with amino sugars and n acetylated derivatives 24 badireddy et al 25 conducted a study to characterize the eps from as and to determine the role of different eps components on aggregation they interpreted the ftir bands at 1740 1720 cm 1 and 1270 1230 cm 1 as implying the presence of o acetylated carbohydrates which have been suggested to take part in cell aggregation adhesion and biofilm integrity lin et al 6 who evaluated the ftir spectra of their ags and its ale assigned the peaks at 1240 cm 1 to the presence of o acetyl ester for bacterial alginates the region at 1500 1300 cm 1 is referred as housing the carboxylic group containing and hydrocarbon like compounds accordingly peaks at 1444 and 1452 cm 1 in the spectra of extracts from r1 and r2 respectively were assigned as the ch bending methylene group and those at 1404 and 1398 cm 1 as the co symmetrical stretching of coo groups in particular badireddy et al 25 suggested that the peak at around a similar position 1398 cm 1 was due to the υs coo of carboxylate group attributed to uronic acids weak peaks at 1314 and 1312 cm 1 might be due to the ch stretching associated with lipids 24 25 the region at 1200 900 cm 1 is associated with the polysaccharides and nucleic acids the strong peak at 1027 cm 1 recorded for sodium alginate as well as the medium broad peaks at 1036 and 1055 cm 1 observed for the extracts of r1 and r2 respectively were assigned to the coc ring vibrations and the coh stretches of the polysaccharides in those samples in particular leal et al 26 and pronk et al 10 addressed the peaks they detected within the 1150 950 cm 1 region as being associated with the stretching vibrations of pyranose rings the 900 650 cm 1 region is referred as the fingerprint region for sodium alginate the apparent peaks at 947 886 and 815 cm 1 were assigned to the co stretching vibration of uronic acid residues c1 h deformation of mannuronic acid residues and the characteristic peak of mannuronic acid residues respectively according to the data reported by leal et al 26 who employed chemical characterization of the alginic acids extracted from brown seaweeds they also reported peaks at 902 and 823 cm 1 in the secondary derivative spectrum attributed to the c1 h deformation of α l guluronic acid residues and deformation vibration of β d mannopyranuronic acid residues respectively lin et al 6 reported same similar results for the ags exops which they characterized as ale sam and dulekgurgen 22 reported peaks at 902 and 879 cm 1 at the corresponding fingerprint region for the extract obtained from an ags treating brewery wastewater for the ags eps extracted from r1 and r2 in this study significantly small yet detectable peaks at the fingerprint region were recorded at 915 895 cm 1 for the ags eps from r1 and at 972 937 920 895 838 cm 1 for the ags eps from r2 which were different than those reported previously for alginates ale therefore it was not possible to directly consider those peaks as indicting the presence of uronic acid residues characteristic of alginates ale moreover different findings were also reported in some other studies for instance in a study on characterization of eps derived from an ags dominated by defluviicoccus sp the peaks at 929 and 847 cm 1 were addressed as referring to the α linkage between monomers and the researchers concluded that the ags eps was not ale but a different acid soluble structural eps containing both glucose and galactose as monomers 10 in some other studies where ftir spectroscopy was used as one of the techniques for characterization of eps isolated from different sources e g from floccular as fed with protein rich influents 27 from as dominated by ammonia oxidizing bacteria 28 from floccular as of a full scale wwtp designed for n removal 25 the peaks detected at 1000 950 cm 1 were attributed to the opo stretching associated with nucleic acids and those at 900 600 cm 1 region were considered as associated with the ring vibrations from aromatic amino acids and nucleotides the ftir analyses employed in this study showed that the structural eps of ags consisted of polysaccharides and possibly some proteins as revealed by the apparent peaks at the 1200 900 cm 1 region and those in the amide i ii and iii regions fig 4 however it was not possible to resolve the organic functional groups at the fingerprint region and thus the extracts might not be addressed directly as ale despite of some similarities with sodium alginate in that region studies on characterization of structural eps form different ags systems have shown that a range of different extracellular biopolymers are produced by ags as mentioned above the exops extracted from an ags system treating municipal wastewater displayed chemical and functional similarities with alginates and therefore addressed as ale 6 the eps extracted from an ags dominated by defluviicoccus sp was characterized as an acid soluble structural eps different than ale 10 the eps extracted from a seawater adapted ags was determined to include sialic acids in particular as the terminal sugar residues of glycoproteins 11 another ags eps was shown to include hyaluronic acid like and sulphated glycosaminoglycans like polymers 29 apparently ftir analyses applied in this study was limited for detailed characterization of the structural eps extracted from the ags and further analyses i e nmr raman spectroscopy xps maldi tof ms etc are required for comprehensive characterization of the extracts and for determination of the functional groups and monomers nevertheless functional similarities with sodium alginate are found to be promising in terms of projecting the possible technical uses of those ags biopolymers in particular the hydrogel forming capacity of the ags exops as presented in this study imply potential of those waste derived biopolymers to be used in several industrial sectors similar to the use of alginate in e g textile printing paper coating etc however implementation might be limited in sectors related to direct human contact consumption like in production of thickeners and gelation agents in food industry drug delivery systems in medical applications etc requiring highly purified extracts 30 still ags extracts have already been tested in some industrial applications ags derived ale was used as surface coating agent providing water resistance to coated papers 31 also after commercially available na alginate was tested as a bio polymer for curing cement based materials 32 ags derived biopolymers have been commercialized as a product for the construction engineering market offering improvement for curing of cement http www ngcm nl curing compound html those industrial applications of ags exops point to the potential of making further use of the wastes from biowwtps by material recovery harvesting added value bio products and decreasing the amount of waste to be handled 3 3 2 pha of ags biomass samples collected from the ags system fed with raw wastewater r1 during the period corresponding to a high organic loading rate olr exhibited strong phb positive results blue black colored cells and visually confirmed the phb accumulation capacity of the granular biomass as presented in fig 5 individual cells as well as cell clusters exhibiting strong phb results were detected in appreciable amounts in all samples in addition to individual phb cells scattered in the samples distinctively compact clusters of phb accumulating organisms were also detected at the inner parts of the flocks fig 5 second row and or at the depths of the smashed granules closer to the granule core fig 5 third row synthesis of phas was reported under deficient operation conditions such as under deficiency of oxygen nitrogen and phosphorus recently pha accumulation in aerobic granules was studied with synthetic wastewater with a sole carbon source such as acetate or ethanol under fully aerobic conditions and the pha contents were in the range of 18 44 biomass w w 33 36 li et al 37 reported that improving the concentration of sludge promoting the production of eps and decreasing the sludge floc size were effective approaches for further accumulation of the phas the pha contents in our ags on day 436 and day 449 same samples with phb staining were found to be 10 8 and 9 3 respectively therefore the relatively low pha content in our study compared with literature should be evaluated based on real wastewater complex carbon sources and anaerobic anoxic and aerobic operation conditions the investigated mixed liquor samples were collected from the system toward the end of the aerobic period prior to settling and withdrawal accordingly detection of phb accumulating organisms at significant levels in those samples not only confirmed the presence and function of those organisms but also indicated that they did not exhaust their phb pools by the end of the applied aerobic phase partial consumption of the intracellular pha reserves under aerobic conditions might limit the subsequent anaerobic uptake of the external carbon source in their study to investigate the eco physiological traits of putative gaos i e defluviicoccus spp present in relatively high levels in full scale ebpr systems burow et al 38 applied fish mar and post fish chemical staining for pha and poly p and determined that the anaerobic aerobic organic matter cycling behavior of the cluster 2 defluviicoccus and absence of poly p accumulation in those organisms were in agreement with the gao physiology the researchers also concluded that when those organisms saturated their pha storage capacity they gradually lost their ability to take up the external carbon source as described above the biomass samples investigated in the current study had appreciable amounts of phb accumulating organisms which did not exhaust their phb reserves by the end of aeration this result in combination with the high olr applied during the corresponding operational period might explain the relatively lower anaerobic cod removal rates 30 40 observed during that period in r1 the glycogen accumulating organism gao candidatus competibacter uses aerobically stored glycogen to enable anaerobic carbon uptake which is subsequently stored as phas 39 the microbial community analysis of the ags evaluated in this current study showed that uncultured candidatus competibacter sp were the most abundant species in r1 35 and r2 8 7 because the olr in r1 3 3 0 3 kgcod m 3 day 1 was higher than that in r2 2 2 0 6 kgcod m 3 day 1 during the stable period additionally competibacteraceae species were also the second abundant species in r1 7 7 table s3 the ability to anaerobically store external carbon sources as pha is the key to the competitiveness of competibacteraceae under dynamic ebpr conditions 40 the high olr up to 3 3 kgcod m 3 day 1 facilitated enrichment of those gaos especially in r1 and also provided an advantage to those over the ebpr governing paos 14 combined evaluation of the results indicating cod removal under anaerobic conditions although at lower levels microbial community analysis showing the abundance of gaos phb staining results displaying the presence of significant amounts of phb accumulating organisms even by the end of aeration and the pha content of the ags suggested that the ags system might serve as a source for pha recovery 4 conclusions the study presents a novel resource recovery system based on zero waste discharge the system consisted of an ags reactor and an external mr from which irrigation water and biopolymers can be recovered the study highlighted that boron concentrations should be carefully checked because boron in treated wastewater of ags mr systems was higher than that in the irrigation water standards structural eps was recovered from the ags of the integrated system they showed the capacity to form hydrogels thus exhibiting a promising potential for several technical uses operating the ags reactor under high olr conditions resulted in enrichment of the gaos which are known as mostly pha accumulating bacteria microbiological observations and the pha content of the ags confirmed phb accumulation capacity of the ags therefore the treatment system was considered as a potential resource for pha recovery because the membrane concentrate contained a high amount of biomass patches the possibility of recovering similar biopolymers from the membrane concentrate needs to be explored further to further contribute to the circular economy of the integrated system declaration of competing interest hereby the authors declare that the content of this article is subject to

14092,this study presents the application of resource recovery from domestic wastewater such as irrigation water structural extracellular polymeric substances eps and polyhydroxyalkanoates phas the resource recovery system consisted of an aerobic granular sludge ags reactor processing domestic wastewater and an external membrane reactor receiving the ags effluent the ags effluent contained large numbers of biomass patches detached from the granular sludge therefore the external membrane served to eliminate the biomass patches and individual bacteria from the ags effluent the permeate of the membrane reactor was compared with the national irrigation water standards the results showed that the membrane effluent was suitable to be used as irrigation water but the boron parameter should be checked for long term irrigation extracellular polysaccharides recovered from the granular sludge were characterized as structural eps the analyses showed that pha accumulating organisms namely uncultured candidatus competibacter sp and competibacteraceae were dominant in the ags reactor and the pha content of the ags was approximately 10 when operated under high organic loading rate conditions phas therefore may also be obtained from ags for the management of membrane concentrate and zero waste discharge approach it is recommended to investigate the recovery possibilities of structural eps and pha biopolymers from the membrane concentrate further because the effluent of ags contained mostly biomass patches detached from granular sludge keywords aerobic granular sludge irrigation water resource recovery structural extracellular polymeric substances eps polyhydroxyalkanoates phas 1 introduction the recovery of water energy and nutrient resources from municipal wastewater provides a promising solution to a number of prevalent economic environmental and social issues 1 first water recycling started with desalination processes in the 1970 s 2 and was then applied to industrial wastewater 3 membrane technology has made water recycling feasible by decreasing the cost however the concentrate of the membrane reactor can be a challenge that needs to be managed therefore the membrane concentrate should be carefully managed for recovery purposes by selecting proper pre treatment units nowadays forward osmosis fo based processes present a novel technology that may simultaneously produce high quality effluents and pre concentrated wastewater for anaerobic treatment to facilitate the recovery of energy water and nutrients however issues of salinity accumulation membrane fouling and anaerobic treatment integration have not been adequately addressed and limit the practical application of these hybrid systems 1 in the last decade wastewater has become a resource rather than a pollutant and wastewater treatment plants wwtp are described as resource recovery systems rrs 4 researches showed that phosphorus 5 bioplastics 4 biopolymers 6 metals 7 and even cellulose 8 might be recovered from wastewater aerobic granular sludge ags technology has been an innovative technology in wastewater treatment ags has numerous advantages such as simultaneous carbon nitrogen and phosphorus removal in a single reactor smaller footprint and less energy requirement when compared with conventional activated sludge systems 9 pronk et al 10 demonstrated that different types of biopolymers can be extracted from ags depending on the microbial community cultivated recently sialic acids have been discovered in the extracellular polymeric substances eps of seawater adapted ags 11 a better understanding of the eps matrix will lead to improved strategies for resource recovery in wastewater treatment systems 12 13 the cultivation the micro and macro structure and the long term operation of two ags systems fed with high and medium strength domestic wastewater were presented in detail in our previous study 14 the study highlighted the effects of large concentrations of suspended solids in raw domestic wastewater the results showed that a large concentrations of suspended solids in raw domestic wastewater have a positive effect on granule size and settling properties of the ags b they can be removed by direct settling inside the reactor and adhesion onto granules and c they affect the detachment of biomass together with high shear force applied in the reactors this study focuses on a novel resource recovery approach by which irrigation water structural eps and polyhydroxyalkanoates phas might be recovered the resource recovery system consisted of an ags reactor processing domestic wastewater and an external membrane reactor receiving ags effluent the study evaluated the possibilities of recovering the membrane permeate as irrigation water and recovering structural eps and phas from the granular sludge and even biomass in the membrane concentrate 2 material and methods 2 1 wastewater characterization wastewater was collected from istanbul university cerrahpasa campus and originated from the engineering faculty technical sciences high school and the main refectory wastewater was collected three times a week and stored at 4 c before being fed to the first ags reactor r1 in addition raw wastewater taken to another storage tank was settled at least for 2 h to remove all settleable solids and used as feed for the second ags reactor r2 metals mentioned in the national irrigation water standards were analyzed only once if they were lower than the values in the standards the analyses of boron iron and copper were repeated three times table 1 includes the detailed characterization of the raw and settled wastewater 2 2 reactors the first unit in the system was an ags reactor two sbrs were operated in parallel the first one with raw wastewater r1 and the second one with settled wastewater r2 the reactors were column type reactors with 28 l of working volume and were operated for 500 days during the last five months of operation stable and mature granules were obtained and the effluents of ags reactors were separately fed to an external membrane reactor the membrane reactor was a lab scale unit with 5 l of working volume a microfiltration membrane was used as mf005 microdyn nadir gmbh germany 2 3 analytical methods effluent samples from the ags reactors

the polysaccharide ps and protein pn analysis are explained in detail in our previous study 14 granular biomass samples from the ags system were also analyzed for structural eps characterization thus the extracellular polymeric substances in particular exopolysaccharides exops were extracted from the sample using na2co3 and by heating as previously outlined by lin et al 6 the extract was added to a cacl2 solution in 1 1 ratio w v and incubated for a day for completion of crosslinking reactions next day the hydrogel beads were examined by e sem quanta feg 250 sem for comparison same treatments

added the vial was capped and sealed using parafilm it was heated using heater block at 100 c for 140 min 17 the vials were left to cool down to room temperature after heating one microliter of deionized water was added into the vial and vortexed for about 30 s three layers formed in the vial and the bottom layer was pipetted out into a vial containing a small amount of sodium sulfate na2so4 the vial was stirred until a clear solution was obtained the clear solution was transferred into a gc vial for quantification gc equipped with an auto injector was used to analyze the solution one

using p 3 hb co 3 hv sigma aldrich 2 6 microscopic examination and microbial community analyses mixed liquor samples were collected from r1 end of aerobic phase to visually verify the presence of phb accumulating organisms and confirm intracellular c storage in the form of lipid like inclusions mainly as phb thin smears were prepared from mixed liquor and smashed ags granules for phb staining samples were treated first with sudan black b staining phb and then with safranin o counter staining according to the manual by jenkins et al 18 microscopic examination of the samples was carried out

silva rdna database the otus were binned into phylotypes 14 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of ags reactors the cultivation structure and long term stability of ags fed with real domestic wastewater with high and medium concentration of suspended solids were investigated in our previous study 14 the ags reactors were operated for 500 days and operation in the last five months was considered as the stable period between day 350 and 500 the studies for recovery of irrigation water and biopolymers from the systems were carried out during the stable period the effluent concentrations of cod nh4 n and po4 3 p and removal efficiencies during the stable period are illustrated in fig 1 and summarized in table s2 cod removal efficiencies in both reactors were quite stable and identical 89 5 in this period and the corresponding effluent cod values from r1 and r2 were 98 71 mg l 1 and 86 38 mg l 1 respectively the removal efficiencies of nh4 n and po4 3 p in both reactors fluctuated unlike the cod removal efficiencies during the stable period because the influent concentrations of nh4 n and po4 3 p changed from 20 to 135 mg l 1 and from 3 to 21 mg l 1 respectively the total nitrogen tn removal efficiency in both reactors was 70 16 on an average and nox n production was negligible at the end of each cycle the removal efficiency of tp was 75 13 in r1 and 78 20 in r2 the removal efficiencies of nh4 n and po4 3 p were lower than those of tn and tp because of the hydrolysis of suspended solids proteins and organic phosphorus fig 1c e and f and table s2 the cycle studies were performed weekly for both reactors and the results of a typical cycle study on day 429 are given in fig 2 the profiles of cod nh4 n and po4 3 p in a cycle were considerably similar in both reactors at the end of the anaerobic period the concentrations increased because of wastewater feeding all three parameters had increasing trends during the first 60 min of the cycle because the reactors were fed continuously during that period under anaerobic conditions hydrolyses of particulate matter causing an increase in soluble cod and adsorption and or biochemical conversion by microorganisms resulting in a decrease in cod were the governing bio reactions during the anaerobic phase the net result of these processes was that the cod concentrations at the end of the anaerobic period in both reactors were 30 40 lower than the calculated values denoting that 30 40 of the cod was removed from the bulk liquid by microorganisms microbial community analyses showed that uncultured candidatus competibacter sp were the most dominated species in r1 35 and in r2 8 7 during the stable period table s3 additionally accumulibacter in both reactors was 4 5 of the total bacteria the presence of these bacteria may explain the lower cod and the slightly higher po4 3 p values obtained by the end of the anaerobic period in comparison to the calculated values slightly increased nh4 n concentrations compared to the calculated values at the end of the anaerobic period were attributed to the hydrolysis of particulate matter proteins the cod nh4 n and po4 3 p were removed at the same rate in the following aerobic phase because the main reaction was biological growth nitrification was negligible with almost no nox n production during the aerobic phase conventional nutrient removal processes nitrification denitrification and ebpr could not be achieved because the conventional nutrient removing organisms autotrophic nitrosomonas and nitrospira and heterotrophic phosphate accumulating accumulibacter did not get enriched in the ags reactors 14 3 2 water recovery for irrigation purposes the effluents of ags reactors had a high ss content due to the short settling time and high shear forces applied in the reactors an external membrane reactor mr was used to eliminate the effluent ss and recover the treated water for irrigation purposes the effluents of ags reactors were subjected to treatability studies in the mr thrice table 2 presents results of one of those treatability studies conducted on day 457 the mr was effective in eliminating ss and fecal coliform whereas no significant improvement was observed in cod nh4 n and po4 3 p removal efficiencies because a microfiltration membrane was used in the mr system the quality of the permeate from the mr was evaluated in comparison to the national irrigation water standards 41 the effluent of mr in r2 was only analyzed because the parameters analyzed in the mr effluents of both reactors were in the similar range except for cod and nh4 n table 2 the results are shown in table 3 the effluent of the ags mr system in r2 was classified as class a in terms of ph bod5 ss and fecal coliform parameters it should be noted that the removal efficiency of cod bod5 in both ags reactors was variable during the study therefore this parameter should be checked for irrigation purposes the chemical quality of the effluent was also evaluated for degree of restriction on irrigation use table 3 ii class irrigation water was provided because of the evaluation of electro conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds sodium adsorption rate sar na sprinkler irrigation only and cl parameters boron parameters were found to be quite high in both settled and treated wastewater classification of irrigation water by resistance of plants to boron mineral is given in table s4 according to table s4 boron resistant plants such as sugar beet alfalfa broad bean onion lettuce and carrot can be irrigated it was thought that the high concentration of boron may result from detergents used for cleaning boron containing cleaning products are marketed as environmentally friendly products however this study emphasizes that the boron parameters should be carefully checked if the treated wastewater is to be recovered as irrigation water and that the use of boron should be managed for future recovery of the treated wastewater heavy metals and toxic element concentrations in the settled wastewater were analyzed and compared with the permissible concentrations at the national agricultural irrigation water standard 41 table 4 most of the heavy metals and toxic element concentrations in the settled wastewater were lower than that of the standard however the copper concentration was determined to be higher than the permissible concentration therefore the copper concentration in the effluent of the ags mr system was measured and found to be 0 018 mg l 1 which was lower than that of the standard thirty percent of the feeding volume of mr was retained as a concentrate after membrane treatment as mentioned in the previous study 14 the suspended solids of the ags reactor effluent consisted of biomass patches detached from the granular sludge analyses of eps showed that the concentration of epsps in the concentrate was in a similar range with the concentration of epsps in the reactors table 2 pishgar et al 21 demonstrated that noteworthy similarity was observed between the relative abundances of genera enriched in the ags sample and discharged from the reactor therefore the resource recovery possibilities were evaluated in the biomass of the reactors 3 3 ags related biopolymers and their potential technical usage 3 3 1 structural eps of ags extracellular polysaccharides exops extracted from the granular sludge of the pilot scale ags system r1 fed with raw wastewater demonstrated gel forming capacity with divalent cations similar to alginates a combination of 2 ags exops in 2 cacl2 produced hydrogel beads as can be seen in fig 3 e sem analysis revealed further similarities in terms of the structure and appearance of the hydrogels formed by sodium alginate fig 3c and the ags exops fig 3d similar results were obtained with the exops extract from the granular sludge fed with settled wastewater r2 successful ionic hydrogel formation of the exops extracted from the granular sludge was in agreement with the results reported by lin et al 6 and sam and dulekgurgen 22 felz et al 23 and further provides clues of why ags systems perform better than conventional floccular activated sludge as systems in terms of biomass aggregation compaction and settling felz et al 23 employed various extraction methods to isolate eps from aerobic granular sludge samples and used the ionic hydrogel cross linked through ca 2 ions formation test to determine whether the extracted eps were structural polymers supporting granulation by contributing to gel formation they reported that among all extracts they tested only the eps extracted by the na2co3 and heating procedure and the exops fraction of that isolated by additional steps referred as ale extraction formed stable ionic hydrogel beads thus considered as the structural eps of the ags accordingly the exops extracted in this study from the ags of the pilot plant was addressed as the structural eps contributing to the granular structure of the biomass which displayed excellent settling properties in the compact treatment system results of the ftir spectroscopy are visually presented in fig 4 and comparatively summarized in table 5 the strong broad bands detected at 3600 3000 cm 1 region and the weaker ones at around 2900 cm 1 were assigned to oh and ch stretching vibrations respectively associated with hydrocarbons between 1700 and 1200 cm 1 region mainly associated with the presence of proteins the spectra of sodium alginate and the structural eps were different spectra of the structural eps displayed peaks at 1700 1600 cm 1 amide i 1600 1500 cm 1 amide ii and 1300 1200 cm 1 amide iii regions for the ags eps from r1 and r2 respectively peaks at 1627 and 1628 cm 1 were attributed to co stretching vibrations associated with proteins amide i region those detected at 1540 and 1532 cm 1 were attributed to nh bending and cn stretching vibrations in conh of proteins amide ii region the peaks at the amide iii region were weaker than those at the amide i and amide ii regions they were at 1237 and 1228 cm 1 and attributed to the cn stretching vibrations in proteins those peaks might be considered as implying the presence of some proteins in the structural eps of ags from r1 and r2 even though the extraction procedure applied in this study was same similar to those proposed for extraction of ale from ags 6 23 respectively alternatively they might be associated with some other functional groups as also reported by some researchers in their study on characterization of eps extracted from a soil isolate and relation between the eps composition and bio flocculation capacity yuan et al suggested that some of the stretches at the amide i ii iii regions attributed to proteins were possible with amino sugars and n acetylated derivatives 24 badireddy et al 25 conducted a study to characterize the eps from as and to determine the role of different eps components on aggregation they interpreted the ftir bands at 1740 1720 cm 1 and 1270 1230 cm 1 as implying the presence of o acetylated carbohydrates which have been suggested to take part in cell aggregation adhesion and biofilm integrity lin et al 6 who evaluated the ftir spectra of their ags and its ale assigned the peaks at 1240 cm 1 to the presence of o acetyl ester for bacterial alginates the region at 1500 1300 cm 1 is referred as housing the carboxylic group containing and hydrocarbon like compounds accordingly peaks at 1444 and 1452 cm 1 in the spectra of extracts from r1 and r2 respectively were assigned as the ch bending methylene group and those at 1404 and 1398 cm 1 as the co symmetrical stretching of coo groups in particular badireddy et al 25 suggested that the peak at around a similar position 1398 cm 1 was due to the υs coo of carboxylate group attributed to uronic acids weak peaks at 1314 and 1312 cm 1 might be due to the ch stretching associated with lipids 24 25 the region at 1200 900 cm 1 is associated with the polysaccharides and nucleic acids the strong peak at 1027 cm 1 recorded for sodium alginate as well as the medium broad peaks at 1036 and 1055 cm 1 observed for the extracts of r1 and r2 respectively were assigned to the coc ring vibrations and the coh stretches of the polysaccharides in those samples in particular leal et al 26 and pronk et al 10 addressed the peaks they detected within the 1150 950 cm 1 region as being associated with the stretching vibrations of pyranose rings the 900 650 cm 1 region is referred as the fingerprint region for sodium alginate the apparent peaks at 947 886 and 815 cm 1 were assigned to the co stretching vibration of uronic acid residues c1 h deformation of mannuronic acid residues and the characteristic peak of mannuronic acid residues respectively according to the data reported by leal et al 26 who employed chemical characterization of the alginic acids extracted from brown seaweeds they also reported peaks at 902 and 823 cm 1 in the secondary derivative spectrum attributed to the c1 h deformation of α l guluronic acid residues and deformation vibration of β d mannopyranuronic acid residues respectively lin et al 6 reported same similar results for the ags exops which they characterized as ale sam and dulekgurgen 22 reported peaks at 902 and 879 cm 1 at the corresponding fingerprint region for the extract obtained from an ags treating brewery wastewater for the ags eps extracted from r1 and r2 in this study significantly small yet detectable peaks at the fingerprint region were recorded at 915 895 cm 1 for the ags eps from r1 and at 972 937 920 895 838 cm 1 for the ags eps from r2 which were different than those reported previously for alginates ale therefore it was not possible to directly consider those peaks as indicting the presence of uronic acid residues characteristic of alginates ale moreover different findings were also reported in some other studies for instance in a study on characterization of eps derived from an ags dominated by defluviicoccus sp the peaks at 929 and 847 cm 1 were addressed as referring to the α linkage between monomers and the researchers concluded that the ags eps was not ale but a different acid soluble structural eps containing both glucose and galactose as monomers 10 in some other studies where ftir spectroscopy was used as one of the techniques for characterization of eps isolated from different sources e g from floccular as fed with protein rich influents 27 from as dominated by ammonia oxidizing bacteria 28 from floccular as of a full scale wwtp designed for n removal 25 the peaks detected at 1000 950 cm 1 were attributed to the opo stretching associated with nucleic acids and those at 900 600 cm 1 region were considered as associated with the ring vibrations from aromatic amino acids and nucleotides the ftir analyses employed in this study showed that the structural eps of ags consisted of polysaccharides and possibly some proteins as revealed by the apparent peaks at the 1200 900 cm 1 region and those in the amide i ii and iii regions fig 4 however it was not possible to resolve the organic functional groups at the fingerprint region and thus the extracts might not be addressed directly as ale despite of some similarities with sodium alginate in that region studies on characterization of structural eps form different ags systems have shown that a range of different extracellular biopolymers are produced by ags as mentioned above the exops extracted from an ags system treating municipal wastewater displayed chemical and functional similarities with alginates and therefore addressed as ale 6 the eps extracted from an ags dominated by defluviicoccus sp was characterized as an acid soluble structural eps different than ale 10 the eps extracted from a seawater adapted ags was determined to include sialic acids in particular as the terminal sugar residues of glycoproteins 11 another ags eps was shown to include hyaluronic acid like and sulphated glycosaminoglycans like polymers 29 apparently ftir analyses applied in this study was limited for detailed characterization of the structural eps extracted from the ags and further analyses i e nmr raman spectroscopy xps maldi tof ms etc are required for comprehensive characterization of the extracts and for determination of the functional groups and monomers nevertheless functional similarities with sodium alginate are found to be promising in terms of projecting the possible technical uses of those ags biopolymers in particular the hydrogel forming capacity of the ags exops as presented in this study imply potential of those waste derived biopolymers to be used in several industrial sectors similar to the use of alginate in e g textile printing paper coating etc however implementation might be limited in sectors related to direct human contact consumption like in production of thickeners and gelation agents in food industry drug delivery systems in medical applications etc requiring highly purified extracts 30 still ags extracts have already been tested in some industrial applications ags derived ale was used as surface coating agent providing water resistance to coated papers 31 also after commercially available na alginate was tested as a bio polymer for curing cement based materials 32 ags derived biopolymers have been commercialized as a product for the construction engineering market offering improvement for curing of cement http www ngcm nl curing compound html those industrial applications of ags exops point to the potential of making further use of the wastes from biowwtps by material recovery harvesting added value bio products and decreasing the amount of waste to be handled 3 3 2 pha of ags biomass samples collected from the ags system fed with raw wastewater r1 during the period corresponding to a high organic loading rate olr exhibited strong phb positive results blue black colored cells and visually confirmed the phb accumulation capacity of the granular biomass as presented in fig 5 individual cells as well as cell clusters exhibiting strong phb results were detected in appreciable amounts in all samples in addition to individual phb cells scattered in the samples distinctively compact clusters of phb accumulating organisms were also detected at the inner parts of the flocks fig 5 second row and or at the depths of the smashed granules closer to the granule core fig 5 third row synthesis of phas was reported under deficient operation conditions such as under deficiency of oxygen nitrogen and phosphorus recently pha accumulation in aerobic granules was studied with synthetic wastewater with a sole carbon source such as acetate or ethanol under fully aerobic conditions and the pha contents were in the range of 18 44 biomass w w 33 36 li et al 37 reported that improving the concentration of sludge promoting the production of eps and decreasing the sludge floc size were effective approaches for further accumulation of the phas the pha contents in our ags on day 436 and day 449 same samples with phb staining were found to be 10 8 and 9 3 respectively therefore the relatively low pha content in our study compared with literature should be evaluated based on real wastewater complex carbon sources and anaerobic anoxic and aerobic operation conditions the investigated mixed liquor samples were collected from the system toward the end of the aerobic period prior to settling and withdrawal accordingly detection of phb accumulating organisms at significant levels in those samples not only confirmed the presence and function of those organisms but also indicated that they did not exhaust their phb pools by the end of the applied aerobic phase partial consumption of the intracellular pha reserves under aerobic conditions might limit the subsequent anaerobic uptake of the external carbon source in their study to investigate the eco physiological traits of putative gaos i e defluviicoccus spp present in relatively high levels in full scale ebpr systems burow et al 38 applied fish mar and post fish chemical staining for pha and poly p and determined that the anaerobic aerobic organic matter cycling behavior of the cluster 2 defluviicoccus and absence of poly p accumulation in those organisms were in agreement with the gao physiology the researchers also concluded that when those organisms saturated their pha storage capacity they gradually lost their ability to take up the external carbon source as described above the biomass samples investigated in the current study had appreciable amounts of phb accumulating organisms which did not exhaust their phb reserves by the end of aeration this result in combination with the high olr applied during the corresponding operational period might explain the relatively lower anaerobic cod removal rates 30 40 observed during that period in r1 the glycogen accumulating organism gao candidatus competibacter uses aerobically stored glycogen to enable anaerobic carbon uptake which is subsequently stored as phas 39 the microbial community analysis of the ags evaluated in this current study showed that uncultured candidatus competibacter sp were the most abundant species in r1 35 and r2 8 7 because the olr in r1 3 3 0 3 kgcod m 3 day 1 was higher than that in r2 2 2 0 6 kgcod m 3 day 1 during the stable period additionally competibacteraceae species were also the second abundant species in r1 7 7 table s3 the ability to anaerobically store external carbon sources as pha is the key to the competitiveness of competibacteraceae under dynamic ebpr conditions 40 the high olr up to 3 3 kgcod m 3 day 1 facilitated enrichment of those gaos especially in r1 and also provided an advantage to those over the ebpr governing paos 14 combined evaluation of the results indicating cod removal under anaerobic conditions although at lower levels microbial community analysis showing the abundance of gaos phb staining results displaying the presence of significant amounts of phb accumulating organisms even by the end of aeration and the pha content of the ags suggested that the ags system might serve as a source for pha recovery 4 conclusions the study presents a novel resource recovery system based on zero waste discharge the system consisted of an ags reactor and an external mr from which irrigation water and biopolymers can be recovered the study highlighted that boron concentrations should be carefully checked because boron in treated wastewater of ags mr systems was higher than that in the irrigation water standards structural eps was recovered from the ags of the integrated system they showed the capacity to form hydrogels thus exhibiting a promising potential for several technical uses operating the ags reactor under high olr conditions resulted in enrichment of the gaos which are known as mostly pha accumulating bacteria microbiological observations and the pha content of the ags confirmed phb accumulation capacity of the ags therefore the treatment system was considered as a potential resource for pha recovery because the membrane concentrate contained a high amount of biomass patches the possibility of recovering similar biopolymers from the membrane concentrate needs to be explored further to further contribute to the circular economy of the integrated system declaration of competing interest hereby the authors declare that the content of this article is subject to

14093,mercury hg is one of the most harmful metals to human health combined with cyanide cn hg forms a stable complex hg cn 2 that is difficult to remove from solution artisanal gold mining effluents containing mercury cyanide complexes are discharged into rivers and streams which can be potentially bioavailable to aquatic organisms in this study activated carbon adsorption was evaluated for its capacity to remove mercury cyanide from solution a solution with hg cn 2 and free cyanide was prepared at ph 12 corresponding to 1 mg l hg2 and 0 5 mg l cn analysis in batch mode showed that 180 min were required to achieve adsorption equilibrium the adsorbent dosage was fixed at 0 1 g of activated carbon which represented an adsorption capacity of 0 14 mg g equivalent to adsorption of 81 hg cn 2 the free cyanide concentration did not affect the adsorption of mercury cyanide experimental data indicated that the adsorption follows pseudo second order kinetics and equilibrium results corresponded to the freundlich adsorption isotherm keywords cyano complexes gold mine tailings mercury contamination remediation systems wastewater adsorption 1 introduction mercury from chemical waste disposal is known to impact the environment mercury occurs in several chemical forms 1 however all mercury species are harmful both to human health and the environment 2 6 gold mining activities especially artisanal gold mining are the main sources of mercury releases and pollution in the environment 7 8 for recovering gold a concentration process called amalgamation is used the ore is contacted with liquid mercury which forms a solid amalgam with gold the next step in the process is to heat the amalgam to distill the mercury and recover the gold 7 due to the process being grossly inefficient typically recovering less than 30 of the gold 9 a secondary gold extraction method is required 10 the gold rich and hg contaminated tailings then undergo a leaching process using cyanide 3 10 11 which removes the remaining gold extracting more than 90 of the metal 3 8 however at the same time the combination of mercury and cyanide form soluble hg cn 2 complex which have been shown to be potentially bioavailable to aquatic organisms mercury cyanide hg cn 2 is a strong and stable cyanide complex even at ph values lower than 9 making this complex difficult to remove from effluents 9 10 the discharge of untreated gold processing effluents rich in hg cn complexes into rivers downstream from gold processing centers is a growing problem around the world 12 adsorption methods are the most commonly used water treatment techniques for effluents containing organic and inorganic contaminants 1 13 20 according to di natale et al 21 and samad et al 5 adsorption techniques are the most indicated methods to remove mercury from effluents czarna et al 22 synthesized zeolites from fly ash for adsorption of ionic mercury from wastewater which reached ion adsorption of 89 for a solution with 575 mg l hg in comparison palm oil fuel ash was used by samad et al 5 as an adsorbent to remove mercury ii from industrial wastewater achieving 91 ion removal at a mercury concentration of 5 mg l activated carbon is considered the main adsorbent used in the removal of impurities from effluents including mercury 23 27 a study by asasian et al 28 investigating mercury adsorption using activated carbon prepared from agricultural waste showed that hg ii adsorption occurred in relation to physical and chemical mechanisms di natale et al 21 who investigated correlations between mercury adsorption on activated carbon and different concentrations of dissolved hg species found that hgoh and hg ii were captured to a higher extent than hgcl but their adsorption was more sensitive to solution ph another study by zhang et al 23 showed that 80 of hg ii was removed from aqueous solution using activated carbon developed from organic sewage sludge zabihi et al 29 evaluated the adsorption of hg 2 on activated carbons from walnut shell whereby the maximum adsorption capacity of the mercury ion on the activated carbon was 151 5 mg g in other numerous studies the adsorption of ionic mercury on activated carbon has been investigated with varying results 24 26 30 31 for the present study the aim was to identify different parameters associated with the adsorption of mercury cyanide on activated carbon including the equilibrium time for adsorbing the complex the mass of activated carbon required to adsorb 1 mg l of hg cn 2 and the influence of free cyanide concentrations from the experimental results adsorption isotherms and kinetic models were evaluated to explain the adsorption process 2 materials and methods 2 1 work solution mercury cyanide solutions were prepared by dissolution of mercuric cyanide hg cn 2 reagent grade and potassium cyanide kcn in an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide at ph 12 the chemical stability of mercury cyanide complexes in solution was determined by the development of chemical equilibrium diagrams for hg and cn in naoh solution at 25 c using hydra medusa software and associated database for this step a mercury concentration of 5μm 1 mg l and a total cyanide concentration of 19μm 0 5 mg l were used together with varying ph from 9 to 14 as artisanal gold mining is characterized by rudimentary techniques 10 32 35 the amount of mercury and cyanide used in gold processing at different mines can vary greatly according to tassel et al 36 the hg concentration in gold processing effluents ranges from 0 2 to 0 98 mg l in addition the cyanide concentration exceeds the amount required to form the complex with mercury for this study a synthetic hg cn 2 solution containing 1 mg l of mercury and 0 5 mg l of total cyanide corresponding to 0 25 mg l free cyanide was used 2 2 sorbent characteristics experiments were conducted with a commercial granular activated carbon produced from coconut shells the original material was sieved to a size of 75 250 μm the textural properties of the adsorbent were examined for surface area measurements by n2 adsorption bet and the morphology was performed using scanning electron microscopy sem the surface charge of the material was determined in accordance with the point of zero charge phpzc which was set up using a 0 01 mol l nacl solution and adjusted to the required ph 1 12 by adding 0 1 mol l naoh and 0 1 mol l hcl the resulting solution 20 ml at each ph was poured into an erlenmeyer flask containing 0 1 g of activated carbon and shaken at 150 rpm for 24 h the final ph and phpzc were then determined 37 2 3 sorption procedure the experiments were carried out in batch mode the activated carbon was weighed in 25 ml erlenmeyer flasks and a 15 ml working solution of mercury cyanide was prepared in different concentrations and directly added to it each sample was shaken at 200 rpm and 25 c the contact time was determined for each experimental step the mercury concentration in solution was measured by atomic absorption spectrometry mercury analyzer ra 915 m with pyrolyzer pyro 915 and the adsorption capacity qe of hg cn 2 on the activated carbon was calculated using equation 1 4 29 38 39 1 qe c0 ce w v where co and ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of mercury ion in solution v is the volume and w is the weight of activated carbon used 2 3 1 effect of contact time on adsorption to investigate the effect of contact time on the adsorption process samples were analyzed at time intervals of 10 20 30 40 60 90 100 120 150 180 240 360 540 960 1200 and 1440 min all the other parameters were kept constant activated carbon dosage of 0 03 g volume of solution at 15 ml temperature of 25 c and shaken at 200 rpm the data obtained for the contact time was used to investigate the adsorption processes of mercury cyanide on the activated carbon whereby the pseudo first order and pseudo second kinetic models were evaluated 2 3 2 influence of activated carbon dosage to investigate the effect of mercury cyanide on the capacity of activated carbon different dosages of adsorbent were used 0 01 0 02 0 03 0 04 0 05 0 06 0 07 0 08 0 09 0 1 0 15 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 g all of the other parameters were kept constant 15 ml solution 25 c temperature 180 min contact time and shaken at 200 rpm 2 3 3 effect of free cyanide concentrations in order to investigate the influence of the free cyanide concentration on mercury cyanide adsorption solutions with different concentration ratios of hg cn 2 and free cn were used the hg cn 2 cnfree ratios varied from 1 0 10 1 4 1 2 1 1 1 1 5 1 10 and 1 50 while maintaining the mercury concentration constant at 1 mg l other parameters such as activated carbon dosage 0 1 g and solution volume 15 ml were kept constant for this stage of the study the cyanide concentration of the samples was also evaluated the measurement was made using a polarographic method for determining cyanide 2 3 4 adsorption isotherms the adsorption data of hg cn 2 onto activated carbon was analyzed using three adsorption models langmuir frundlich and temkin the langmuir equation can be written as equation 2 4 23 39 40 2 ce qe 1 qm kl ce qm where ce mg l is the equilibrium concentration of hg cn 2 in solution qe mg g is the volume of complexes adsorbed qm mg g is the maximum adsorption capacity of complexes and kl l mg is the langmuir adsorption equilibrium constant the freundlich isotherm is expressed as equation 3 4 23 40 3 log qe log kf 1 n log ce where kf mg g and n g l are the freundlich constants related to adsorption capacity and intensity the temkin isotherm can be expressed as equation 4 38 40 4 qe rt bt ln kt rt bt ln ce qe where t k is the temperature r is the universal gas constant equal to 8 314 j mol k bt j mol and kt l g are the constants related to the adsorption heat and to maximum binding energy respectively the resulting data were obtained by varying the concentration of mercury cyanide and free cyanide while the hg concentrations varied between 0 25 and 2 5 mg l the hg cntotal ratio 2 1 was maintained for all of the study solutions 3 results and discussion to understand the stability of hg cn 2 and free cyanide behavior a speciation diagram for the working solution was constructed using hydra medusa software according to drace et al 3 mercury cyanide can form different complexes such as hg cn 2 hg cn 3 and hg cn 2 4 fig 1 shows the speciation diagrams predicted by the hydra medusa software in the selected ph range 9 14 mercury is mainly present as the hg cn 2 complex for free cyanide at ph above 11 the cn ion is the predominant species against hcn hydrogen cyanide however the presence of hcn increased with the lowering of ph values as established in the literature 3 9 based on the speciation diagram all of the mercury present was considered to be tied up as a hg cn 2 complex while the other complexes were considered in low concentration or disregarded 3 1 sorbent characteristics the sem micrograph of activated carbon can be seen in fig 2 which shows that the morphology of the adsorbent has an irregular shape and the presence of pores in the material is a characteristic typical of activated carbon 41 the bet surface area of the activated carbon was found to be 506 3m2 g with a total pore volume of 0 24cm3 g the phpzc was approximately 7 7 showing that the activated carbon had a slightly basic nature 3 2 sorption procedure 3 2 1 effect of contact time on adsorption the influence of contact time on the removal of hg cn 2 by activated carbon can be seen in fig 3 the removal efficiency increased rapidly in the first minutes reaching about 0 27 g mg at 10 min which was equal to 58 adsorption this behavior is a result of the number of available active sites on the activated carbon surface equilibrium was reached in approximately 180 min giving an adsorption capacity of 0 40 mg g which was equivalent to 81 adsorption therefore the adsorption time of mercury cyanide was set to 180 min in each experiment based on the contact time results the adsorption kinetics of mercury cyanide on activated carbon were investigated the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were applied to the kinetic study whereby the model that best fits a straight line r2 values describes the probable adsorption mechanism these kinetic expressions are defined as 39 42 43 5 ln qe qt ln qe k1t 6 t qt 1 k2qe 2 t qe where qt and qe are mercury cyanide absorbed at time t and at equilibrium respectively and k1 and k2 is the first order and second order reaction rate equilibrium constant respectively figs 4 and 5 show the results of the kinetic data modeling the pseudo second order model describes the adsorption of hg cn 2 better than that of the pseudo first order according to the data in table 2 the pseudo second order kinetic model had the best correlation coefficient which was corroborated by the similarity between the calculated qe value and the experimental value these results suggested that the adsorption data were well represented by this model table 1 according to the pseudo second order kinetic the adsorption of mercury cyanide occurs by chemisorption and ion exchange 18 28 the adsorption capacity for the hg cn 2 activated carbon system was low compared to other systems synthetic and surface activated materials can achieve theoretical adsorption capacities greater than 18 mg g for wastewater containing dyes and endocrine disrupting chemicals or even greater than 42 mg g for dibenzothiophene which are both treated with synthesized adsorbents 18 19 however even with lower adsorption capacity compared to other adsorption processes activated carbon was efficient enough to remove the mercury complex without surface pretreatment 3 2 2 influence of activated carbon dosage a significant increase in hg cn 2 adsorption was observed when the dosage of activated carbon was increased from 0 01 5 0 g as this leads to the introduction of more active sites available for adsorption 42 44 fig 6 shows that even with a small amount of activated carbon 0 01 g it was possible to remove 47 of mercury cyanide between 0 01 and 0 1 g adsorption ranged from 47 to 93 however between 0 1 and 0 5 g of activated carbon adsorption varied between 93 98 the adsorption capacity for 0 1 g of adsorbent was 0 14 mg g 3 2 3 effect of free cyanide concentrations the effect of free cyanide concentrations was investigated using solutions with different initial concentration between zero and 50 mg l while maintaining the mercury concentration constant at 1 mg l the results can be seen in fig 7 which shows that hg cn 2 adsorption remained constant and above 92 for all of the free cyanide concentrations this means that the amount of free cyanide had little influence on the adsorption of mercury cyanide by activated carbon for the 10 1 and 4 1 ratios the free cyanide was 100 adsorbed for the other ratios adsorption was reduced with increasing cn ion concentration based on this the selectivity for the complex was higher than for the cyanide ion 3 2 4 adsorption isotherms in this study langmuir freundlich and temkin models were used to describe the equilibrium experimental data for the adsorption of mercury cyanide on activated carbon the results are reported in table 2 and the isotherms shown in figs 8 10 the experimental data fit the freundlich isotherm model r2 0 9738 better than the langmuir and temkin models although the langmuir model is the model that best fits for contaminant removal systems using both natural 27 and synthetic adsorbents 18 20 isotherms in activated carbon systems have been shown to fit well with the freundlich model 18 20 45 46 the freundlich model assumes a multilayer and reversible adsorption within a heterogeneous system 28 47 the n value represents the adsorption intensity for the experimental data n was calculated at 1 31 g l it is important to point out that n values between one and ten indicates that the adsorption was favorable between the adsorbent and the pollutant 29 however if the value of n is equal to 1 this indicates linear adsorption leading to identical adsorption energies for all sites 48 as the n value in this case was greater than one there is good indication of a strong physical bond between the activated carbon and hg cn 2 38 4 conclusions mercury and cyanide form a complex that remains in solution as the hg cn 2 species even at ph values where the cyanide ion is transformed into hydrogen cyanide the hg cn 2 complex remains stable which was confirmed by the speciation diagram adams 49 had previously predicted that activated carbon had a better affinity for neutral species as hg cn 2 than for negatively charged species the commercial granular activated carbon a presented surface area of 506 3m2 g in addition the phpzc of the material was 7 7 in this study commercial granular activated carbon was effective for the removal of mercury cyanide at ph 12 even with the rapid adsorption of the complex on activated carbon the adsorption equilibrium was achieved in 180 min at that time the adsorption capacity for 0 03 g of carbon was 0 40 mg g corresponding to 81 hg cn 2 removal between 0 1 and 0 5 g of activated carbon adsorption varied from 93 98 using 0 1 g of adsorbent the adsorption capacity was 0 14 mg g the adsorption of hg cn 2 remained constant and above 92 for all of the free cyanide concentrations the presence of free cyanide did not affect the adsorption of the complex on the activated carbon the present study showed that the adsorption of mercury cyanide complex on activated carbon followed the freundlich adsorption isotherm model with the pseudo second order model being the best for describing the adsorption kinetics of hg cn 2 based on these theories it was concluded that adsorption occurred by chemisorption and ion exchange in addition the system was determined to be heterogeneous with reversible and multilayer adsorption as well as being a physical process adsorption was favorable and the bonds between the activated carbon and the hg cn 2 were strong statement of novelty the main objective of this work is to evaluate the possibility of absorption in activated carbon for mercury cyanide even though many researchers were worked with activated carbon very few researchers were reported about mercury cyanide complexes the adsorption capacity for mercury is known but the conditions of the artisanal gold mining effluent make the parameters different for the adsorption the combination of highly toxic compounds mercury and cyanide are potentially hazardous when exposed to the environment and workers the evaluation of the removal of these complexes is in accordance with the journal proposal and its search for new approaches declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

14093,mercury hg is one of the most harmful metals to human health combined with cyanide cn hg forms a stable complex hg cn 2 that is difficult to remove from solution artisanal gold mining effluents containing mercury cyanide complexes are discharged into rivers and streams which can be potentially bioavailable to aquatic organisms in this study activated carbon adsorption was evaluated for its capacity to remove mercury cyanide from solution a solution with hg cn 2 and free cyanide was prepared at ph 12 corresponding to 1 mg l hg2 and 0 5 mg l cn analysis in batch mode showed that 180 min were required to achieve adsorption equilibrium the adsorbent dosage was fixed at 0 1 g of activated carbon which represented an adsorption capacity of 0 14 mg g equivalent to adsorption of 81 hg cn 2 the free cyanide concentration did not affect the adsorption of mercury cyanide experimental data indicated that the adsorption follows pseudo second order kinetics and equilibrium results corresponded to the freundlich adsorption isotherm keywords cyano complexes gold mine tailings mercury contamination remediation systems wastewater adsorption 1 introduction mercury from chemical waste disposal is known to impact the environment mercury occurs in several chemical forms 1 however all mercury species are harmful both to human health and the environment 2 6 gold mining activities especially artisanal gold mining are the main sources of mercury releases and pollution in the environment 7 8 for recovering gold a concentration process called amalgamation is used the ore is contacted with liquid mercury which forms a solid amalgam with gold the next step in the process is to heat the amalgam to distill the mercury and recover the gold 7 due to the process being grossly inefficient typically recovering less than 30 of the gold 9 a secondary gold extraction method is required 10 the gold rich and hg contaminated tailings then undergo a leaching process using cyanide 3 10 11 which removes the remaining gold extracting more than 90 of the metal 3 8 however at the same time the combination of mercury and cyanide form soluble hg cn 2 complex which have been shown to be potentially bioavailable to aquatic organisms mercury cyanide hg cn 2 is a strong and stable cyanide complex even at ph values lower than 9 making this complex difficult to remove from effluents 9 10 the discharge of untreated gold processing effluents rich in hg cn complexes into rivers downstream from gold processing centers is a growing problem around the world 12 adsorption methods are the most commonly used water treatment techniques for effluents containing organic and inorganic contaminants 1 13 20 according to di natale et al 21 and samad et al 5 adsorption techniques are the most indicated methods to remove mercury from effluents czarna et al 22 synthesized zeolites from fly ash for adsorption of ionic mercury from wastewater which reached ion adsorption of 89 for a solution with 575 mg l hg in comparison palm oil fuel ash was used by samad et al 5 as an adsorbent to remove mercury ii from industrial wastewater achieving 91 ion removal at a mercury concentration of 5 mg l activated carbon is considered the main adsorbent used in the removal of impurities from effluents including mercury 23 27 a study by asasian et al 28 investigating mercury adsorption using activated carbon prepared from agricultural waste showed that hg ii adsorption occurred in relation to physical and chemical mechanisms di natale et al 21 who investigated correlations between mercury adsorption on activated carbon and different concentrations of dissolved hg species found that hgoh and hg ii were captured to a higher extent than hgcl but their adsorption was more sensitive to solution ph another study by zhang et al 23 showed that 80 of hg ii was removed from aqueous solution using activated carbon developed from organic sewage sludge zabihi et al 29 evaluated the adsorption of hg 2 on activated carbons from walnut shell whereby the maximum adsorption capacity of the mercury ion on the activated carbon was 151 5 mg g in other numerous studies the adsorption of ionic mercury on activated carbon has been investigated with varying results 24 26 30 31 for the present study the aim was to identify different parameters associated with the adsorption of mercury cyanide on activated carbon including the equilibrium time for adsorbing the complex the mass of activated carbon required to adsorb 1 mg l of hg cn 2 and the influence of free cyanide concentrations from the experimental results adsorption isotherms and kinetic models were evaluated to explain the adsorption process 2 materials and methods 2 1 work solution mercury cyanide solutions were prepared by dissolution of mercuric cyanide hg cn 2 reagent grade and potassium cyanide kcn in an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide at ph 12 the chemical stability of mercury cyanide complexes in solution was determined by the development of chemical equilibrium diagrams for hg and cn in naoh solution at 25 c using hydra medusa software and associated database for this step a mercury concentration of 5μm 1 mg l and a total cyanide concentration of 19μm 0 5 mg l were used together with varying ph from 9 to 14 as artisanal gold mining is characterized by rudimentary techniques 10 32 35 the amount of mercury and cyanide used in gold processing at different mines can vary greatly according to tassel et al 36 the hg concentration in gold processing effluents ranges from 0 2 to 0 98 mg l in addition the cyanide concentration exceeds the amount required to form the complex with mercury for this study a synthetic hg cn 2 solution containing 1 mg l of mercury and 0 5 mg l of total cyanide corresponding to 0 25 mg l free cyanide was used 2 2 sorbent characteristics experiments were conducted with a commercial granular activated carbon produced from coconut shells the original material was sieved to a size of 75 250 μm the textural properties of the adsorbent were examined for surface area measurements by n2 adsorption bet and the morphology was performed using scanning electron microscopy sem the surface charge of the material was determined in accordance with the point of zero charge phpzc which was set up using a 0 01 mol l nacl solution and adjusted to the required ph 1 12 by adding 0 1 mol l naoh and 0 1 mol l hcl the resulting solution 20 ml at each ph was poured into an erlenmeyer flask containing 0 1 g of activated carbon and shaken at 150 rpm for 24 h the final ph and phpzc were then determined 37 2 3 sorption procedure the experiments were carried out in batch mode the activated carbon was weighed in 25 ml erlenmeyer flasks and a 15 ml working solution of mercury cyanide was prepared in different concentrations and directly added to it each sample was shaken at 200 rpm and 25 c the contact time was determined for each experimental step the mercury concentration in solution was measured by atomic absorption spectrometry mercury analyzer ra 915 m with pyrolyzer pyro 915 and the adsorption capacity qe of hg cn 2 on the activated carbon was calculated using equation 1 4 29 38 39 1 qe c0 ce w v where co and ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of mercury ion in solution v is the volume and w is the weight of activated carbon used 2 3 1 effect of contact time on adsorption to investigate the effect of contact time on the adsorption process samples were analyzed at time intervals of 10 20 30 40 60 90 100 120 150 180 240 360 540 960 1200 and 1440 min all the other parameters were kept constant activated carbon dosage of 0 03 g volume of solution at 15 ml temperature of 25 c and shaken at 200 rpm the data obtained for the contact time was used to investigate the adsorption processes of mercury cyanide on the activated carbon whereby the pseudo first order and pseudo second kinetic models were evaluated 2 3 2 influence of activated carbon dosage to investigate the effect of mercury cyanide on the capacity of activated carbon different dosages of adsorbent were used 0 01 0 02 0 03 0 04 0 05 0 06 0 07 0 08 0 09 0 1 0 15 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 g all of the other parameters were kept constant 15 ml solution 25 c temperature 180 min contact time and shaken at 200 rpm 2 3 3 effect of free cyanide concentrations in order to investigate the influence of the free cyanide concentration on mercury cyanide adsorption solutions with different concentration ratios of hg cn 2 and free cn were used the hg cn 2 cnfree ratios varied from 1 0 10 1 4 1 2 1 1 1 1 5 1 10 and 1 50 while maintaining the mercury concentration constant at 1 mg l other parameters such as activated carbon dosage 0 1 g and solution volume 15 ml were kept constant for this stage of the study the cyanide concentration of the samples was also evaluated the measurement was made using a polarographic method for determining cyanide 2 3 4 adsorption isotherms the adsorption data of hg cn 2 onto activated carbon was analyzed using three adsorption models langmuir frundlich and temkin the langmuir equation can be written as equation 2 4 23 39 40 2 ce qe 1 qm kl ce qm where ce mg l is the equilibrium concentration of hg cn 2 in solution qe mg g is the volume of complexes adsorbed qm mg g is the maximum adsorption capacity of complexes and kl l mg is the langmuir adsorption equilibrium constant the freundlich isotherm is expressed as equation 3 4 23 40 3 log qe log kf 1 n log ce where kf mg g and n g l are the freundlich constants related to adsorption capacity and intensity the temkin isotherm can be expressed as equation 4 38 40 4 qe rt bt ln kt rt bt ln ce qe where t k is the temperature r is the universal gas constant equal to 8 314 j mol k bt j mol and kt l g are the constants related to the adsorption heat and to maximum binding energy respectively the resulting data were obtained by varying the concentration of mercury cyanide and free cyanide while the hg concentrations varied between 0 25 and 2 5 mg l the hg cntotal ratio 2 1 was maintained for all of the study solutions 3 results and discussion to understand the stability of hg cn 2 and free cyanide behavior a speciation diagram for the working solution was constructed using hydra medusa software according to drace et al 3 mercury cyanide can form different complexes such as hg cn 2 hg cn 3 and hg cn 2 4 fig 1 shows the speciation diagrams predicted by the hydra medusa software in the selected ph range 9 14 mercury is mainly present as the hg cn 2 complex for free cyanide at ph above 11 the cn ion is the predominant species against hcn hydrogen cyanide however the presence of hcn increased with the lowering of ph values as established in the literature 3 9 based on the speciation diagram all of the mercury present was considered to be tied up as a hg cn 2 complex while the other complexes were considered in low concentration or disregarded 3 1 sorbent characteristics the sem micrograph of activated carbon can be seen in fig 2 which shows that the morphology of the adsorbent has an irregular shape and the presence of pores in the material is a characteristic typical of activated carbon 41 the bet surface area of the activated carbon was found to be 506 3m2 g with a total pore volume of 0 24cm3 g the phpzc was approximately 7 7 showing that the activated carbon had a slightly basic nature 3 2 sorption procedure 3 2 1 effect of contact time on adsorption the influence of contact time on the removal of hg cn 2 by activated carbon can be seen in fig 3 the removal efficiency increased rapidly in the first minutes reaching about 0 27 g mg at 10 min which was equal to 58 adsorption this behavior is a result of the number of available active sites on the activated carbon surface equilibrium was reached in approximately 180 min giving an adsorption capacity of 0 40 mg g which was equivalent to 81 adsorption therefore the adsorption time of mercury cyanide was set to 180 min in each experiment based on the contact time results the adsorption kinetics of mercury cyanide on activated carbon were investigated the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were applied to the kinetic study whereby the model that best fits a straight line r2 values describes the probable adsorption mechanism these kinetic expressions are defined as 39 42 43 5 ln qe qt ln qe k1t 6 t qt 1 k2qe 2 t qe where qt and qe are mercury cyanide absorbed at time t and at equilibrium respectively and k1 and k2 is the first order and second order reaction rate equilibrium constant respectively figs 4 and 5 show the results of the kinetic data modeling the pseudo second order model describes the adsorption of hg cn 2 better than that of the pseudo first order according to the data in table 2 the pseudo second order kinetic model had the best correlation coefficient which was corroborated by the similarity between the calculated qe value and the experimental value these results suggested that the adsorption data were well represented by this model table 1 according to the pseudo second order kinetic the adsorption of mercury cyanide occurs by chemisorption and ion exchange 18 28 the adsorption capacity for the hg cn 2 activated carbon system was low compared to other systems synthetic and surface activated materials can achieve theoretical adsorption capacities greater than 18 mg g for wastewater containing dyes and endocrine disrupting chemicals or even greater than 42 mg g for dibenzothiophene which are both treated with synthesized adsorbents 18 19 however even with lower adsorption capacity compared to other adsorption processes activated carbon was efficient enough to

remove 47 of mercury cyanide between 0 01 and 0 1 g adsorption ranged from 47 to 93 however between 0 1 and 0 5 g of activated carbon adsorption varied between 93 98 the adsorption capacity for 0 1 g of adsorbent was 0 14 mg g 3 2 3 effect of free cyanide concentrations the effect of free cyanide concentrations was investigated using solutions with different initial concentration between zero and 50 mg l while maintaining the mercury concentration constant at 1 mg l the results can be seen in fig 7 which shows that hg cn 2 adsorption remained constant and above 92 for all of the free cyanide concentrations this means that the amount of free cyanide had little influence on the adsorption of mercury cyanide by activated carbon for the 10 1 and 4 1 ratios the free cyanide was 100 adsorbed for the other ratios adsorption was reduced with increasing cn ion concentration based on this the selectivity for the complex was higher than for the cyanide ion 3 2 4 adsorption isotherms in this study langmuir freundlich and temkin models were used to describe the equilibrium experimental data for the adsorption of mercury cyanide on activated carbon the results are reported in table 2 and

is considered world s second major producer of textiles and garments after china 2 the textile industry is considered as one of the water intensive industries that produces a high volume of wastewater 200 350 l of wastewater per kg of finished product in particular textile industries discharge significant quantities of surfactants fixing agents oxidizing agents recalcitrant chlorinated compounds dispersing agents smoothing agents organic dyes additives fine starch particles and some salts 3 7 which ultimately results in high turbidity colour chemical oxygen demand dissolved solids suspended solids colloids metals and organic matter in the receiving water environment 8 9 shan et al 2017 10 such effluents are also reported as potential sources of mutagenic and carcinogenic substances other negative impacts of such effluents include loss in agricultural productivity 1 11 reduced photosynthesis activities deteriorated health of humans and living creatures depleted dissolved oxygen levels and disturbance in flora and fauna 12 3 to date a significant number of textiles effluent treatment processes either removal or destructive have been reported in the literature 13 some of the well proven methods are photo electrochemical process 14 adsorption ion exchange membrane filtration 15 chemical precipitation 16 flotation biological treatment using fungi bacteria algae and bio coagulants extracted from plants 17 13 advanced oxidation processes 13 and coagulation flocculation 18 most of these processes either convert the toxic substances into non toxic substances or separate out from the aqueous phase 13 so far two categories of coagulants named synthetic mainly inorganic and natural plant based prolific sources of coagulating peptides have been discussed in literature for coagulation flocculation process based wastewater treatment 11 the first one covers mainly iron aluminum and magnesium salts poly aluminum chloride and calcium carbonate which are extensively used in textile wastewater treatment 19 some of the notable drawbacks of such coagulants include high operational cost toxic and or non biodegradable voluminous sludge generation 20 and reduced efficiencies at low temperature 10 contrary the natural coagulants polymeric macromolecules derived from plants microorganisms animals and having polysaccharides or proteins as coagulating agent have been proven of great ecological and environmental importance 20 the inevitable features of such coagulants include their biodegradability wide sources rich variety unlikely to alter the ph and conductivity of treated water 21 due to these added advantages these coagulants have garnered a particular interest of researchers particularly in textile industry effluent s treatment 22 23 moringa oleifera m oleifera a member of the moringaceae family widely adapted in tropic and subtropics sand cultivated areas of developing world has been thoroughly studied as one of the most promising natural coagulant 24 28 the seeds of m oleifera have 1 dimeric and or densely charged cationic proteins molecular mass 6 16 kda isoelectric ph 10 11 which can remove the wastewater impurities through electrostatic interaction between cationic protein and colloidal present in wastewater 10 29 30 the recent research trends revealed that the cationic proteins available in seeds can be extracted through various physical and or chemical methods such as salt based extraction precipitation delipidation centrifugation ion exchange lyophilization and membrane based separation such as dialysis 10 with the paucity of studies based on use of crude seed powder as coagulant very limited numbers of works have been carried out regarding the size effects of powder on coagulation efficiency of textile wastewaters 31 32 further most of the studies have been reported on the treatment of synthetic colored wastewaters but to the best of our knowledge there is no previous literature centered on segregated as well as mixed textile industry wastewater using m oleifera seed powder bearing these considerations in mind the present study was aimed to investigate the potential of m oleifera seed powders of different sizes for the treatment of segregated and combined mixed effluents collected from the textile industry attempts have also been made to optimize the process by way of developing formulations using combinations of different operational parameters such as coagulation flocculation ph optimum dose and sedimentation times the powders were characterized using swelling ratio point of zero charge analysis fourier transform infrared spectroscopy zeta potential measurement and x ray diffraction analysis further the rate of turbidity reduction was investigated through kinetic

highly pure and of analytical grade and procured from merck germany and fisher scientific usa distilled water was used throughout the experiments 2 6 coagulation flocculation studies the coagulation flocculation behavior of prepared coagulants i e cp and fp with various wastewater types was investigated by a standard jar apparatus all the jar tests were performed in 1000 ml capacity beakers with a working volume of 500 ml of homogenized wastewater sample the equipment was configured for a sequential process involving a flash mixing for 2 min at a stirring speed of 100 rpm followed by slow mixing at 40 rpm for 30 min next beakers were carefully removed from the jar apparatus and the samples were allowed to settle for 30 min at room temperature these jar testing criteria were established on the basis on previous studies 13 35 performed with similar coagulant such as tamarind seed winged bean seed flamboyant seed acquapol c1 opuntia spp 36 37 31 after desired settling time supernatant samples were analyzed for selected physico chemical parameters 2 7 materials and methods the study was conducted under a controlled environment constant temperature and light intensity different operational parameters were investigated during this study to establish their influence on the coagulation flocculation process the research variables involved in this study included coagulant dosage sedimentation time and coagulation flocculation ph at the end of each experiment the supernatant was collected and analyzed in terms of residual ph and turbidity the color and cod measurements were done at optimized conditions 2 8 experimental investigations below are the details of experiments which were conducted for different wastewater and coagulants combinations dr cp sr cp am cp dr fp sr fp and am fp 2 8 1 determination of coagulation flocculation ph in this study the optimum coagulation flocculation ph was determined for studied coagulant and wastewater combinations for this purpose a fixed dose 1 g l of each coagulant was added to 500 ml of the wastewater sample with initially adjusted ph in the range of 6 9 this range of ph was chosen on the basis of values reported in previous literature 38 after performing standard jar test residual turbidity was determine the coagulation flocculation performance assessed in terms of residual turbidity the ph corresponding to minimum residual turbidity of supernatant was then considered as optimum coagulation flocculation ph 2 8 2 estimation of optimum coagulant dosage the coagulant dose optimization experiments were conducted by varying the coagulant dose at optimum ph and according to the standard jar procedure sedimentation time 30 min in this experiment a total of eight concentrations 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 g l of both the prepared coagulants were used this range was consistent with the dose reported in the literature which suggests a range of 0 5 6 0 g l 13 del real olvera et al 2016 residual turbidity of supernatant was measured from each jar experiment performed with applied dosage the dose corresponding to minimum residual turbidity was considered as optimum coagulant dose 2 8 3 effect of sedimentation time in this study the optimum sedimentation time was chosen on the basis of wastewater coagulant combination and minimum residual turbidity achieved at optimized dose the sedimentation effect on residual turbidity was studied in the range of 30 360 min floc sedimentation was evaluated by measuring the residual turbidity at different intervals for studied wastewater coagulant combinations 2 8 4 sedimentation kinetic studies to study the sedimentation kinetics three well well known kinetic models i e zero order first order and second order are used in this study table 2 12 all the kinetic investigations were done at optimized coagulant dose coagulation flocculation ph and sedimentation time 2 9 statistical analysis in this study origin pro version 8 1 was employed to present the experimental data graphically as well as to investigate the behavior of cp and fp in this regard the pearson correlation analysis was done at p 0 95 to check weather two different sizes of m oleifera seeds powder behaved in similar or different way for the treatment of wastewater samples all the statistical analysis was performed using microsoft excel 2016 3 results and discussion below sections summarize the results obtained from this research study 3 1 physico chemical characterization of prepared coagulants the phzpc and swelling ratio are among the well known crucial parameters in order to understand the coagulation process and sludge production respectively 32 33 the swelling ratio and phzpc plots of prepared m oleifera seed powders i e cp and fp are presented in fig 3 the phzpc values of both the powders were observed to be between 5 5 6 this clearly indicates that when wastewater ph phzpc the coagulation is favorable however this value was significantly different than the one reported by 39 who obtained a phzpc of 4 4 for the raw m oleifera seeds powder the swelling ratio for prepared powders were observed to be 38 and 42 6 for cp and fp respectively these ratios were observed to be approximately three times the values reported 14 2 for biochared m oleifera seeds powder such high swelling ratio may be attributed to the presence of the hydrophilic cooh groups observed between the wavelength range of 1639 63 1643 63 cm 1 33 40 however it is important to mention here that such possibilities are reported for molecularly imprinted polymer i e thiamine hydrochloride templated silylated montmorillonite itaconic acid polymer further they observed that maximum swelling is possible at ph 7 0 probably due to repulsive force between coo groups ionized at this ph similar patterns were also reported by 41 for the m oleifera cationic protein obtained from the seed powder treated clay microparticles hence detailed investigations are required in this direction to have the better understanding of swelling behavior of seed powders 3 2 instrumental characterization of prepared coagulants 3 2 1 ftir analysis the analysis of various functional groups present in prepared powder coagulants was done using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis 42 fig 4 shows the ftir analysis results of cp and fp the corresponding peaks are for specific regions that reflect the presence of functional groups attributed to stretching and bending vibrations the ftir spectra of both powders of m oleifera seeds were almost identical except for the intensity variations a total of 10 major peaks were observed in the spectra indicating a variety of functional groups within the investigated range 4000 500 cm 1 table 3 shows the peak positions of the observed functional groups the absorption peaks observed between 2950 and 2850 cm 1 were due to symmetrical and asymmetrical stretching of ch and ch2 methyl groups present in the fatty acids the peak observed between 2400 and 2420 cm 1 in spectra revealed the presence of nitrile group cn the band at 1723 cm 1 is assigned to coc bond stretching of ester group present in fatty acid and protein structures the peak at 1643 63 cm 1 may be associated with cn or nh amide sharp peak observed between 1500 and 1530 cm 1 confirmed the presence of aliphatic nitro compound these peaks also reflect the flocculating capabilities of the seed powder coagulants the peak observed between 1240 1270 cm 1 indicated presence of aromatic ether or amines stretch the moderately intense peak between 1150 and 1160 cm 1 indicated the presence of either cn stretch or ocn stretch the cp and fp exhibited out of plane c h bending vibrations below 800 cm 1 the peak at 504 cm 1 confirmed the presence of halogenated alkanes 3 2 2 xrd analysis fig 5 shows the xrd patterns of cp and fp coagulant the analysis results revealed the poorly resolved peaks which may be attributed to the predominance representing around 69 of the total mass of amorphous material such as protein and lipids content present in the used non shelled m oleifera seeds such nature of coagulant suggest that pollutants can easily penetrate the coagulant surface 45 in particular the peaks observed at 2θ 10 and 2θ 20 respectively may be responsible for semi crystalline nature of the powders 46 however it is important to mention here that the peak observed at 2θ 10 was very small as compared to 2θ 20 high peak at 2θ 20 confirms that the prepared material is mainly amorphous in nature and have a significant amount of protein structure constituents 47 although both the prepared coagulants cp and fp showed similar xrd patterns but such results may be linked with the way specifications of apparatus used for powder preparation milling such as domestic blender industrial blender specification of blades blending speed rpm and duration of blending detailed investigations in this direction may provide more insight about these patterns 3 2 3 zeta potential measurements zeta potential of the prepared cp and fp coagulants was studied at neutral ph to determine their surface charge the powder of higher sizes i e cp was observed to be having a zeta potential of 10 4 mv which clearly indicates that the surface of coagulant was dominated by positive charges further such high value of zeta potential indicate that an electrostatically stabilized suspension will remain stable this value may be attributed to the protonation of the amine and amide functional groups in cp which facilitated the movement of negatively charged colloidal particles or wastewater impurities these values were observed to be equivalent of biochared m oleifera seed powder 33 on the other side fp was observed to be having negative surface charge 1 34 which may be attributed to the release of oily material during the preparation of fine powder more specifically the coating of oily material over particle surface may facilitate the release of neutralized impurities back into the solution these findings were in good accordance with previous studies 48 3 3 coagulation flocculation ph ph is one of the most important operational factors which can be used in developing plausible mechanism for coagulation flocculation based wastewater treatment systems 13 fig 6 shows the minimum turbidity levels achieved at different ph levels for investigated wastewater and coagulant combinations the experimental results revealed that irrespective of sizes of prepared powders the optimum ph was 6 5 7 5 and 8 for dr sr and am wastewater samples respectively further experiments were conducted at these ph levels these values were found to in the range of optimum ph reported in previous studies 31 44 post experiments alkaline ph 8 5 9 0 levels were observed in treated water such conditions may be attributed to the exchange of protons in water by hydroxyl groups resulted due to presence of cationic water soluble proteins found in skin of m oleifera seeds hence the use of m oleifera seeds powder offers additional features such as negligible ph adjustment for larger full scale installation 37 3 4 effect of coagulant dosage the coagulant dose is one of the prime factors which play crucial role in evaluating the optimum parameters to ensure techno economic viability of coagulation flocculation process 13 fig 7 shows the plots of residual turbidity and dose applied for investigated wastewater coagulant combinations the experimental investigations revealed that minimum turbidity was achieved at a coagulant dose of 3 3 3 2 2 and 1 g l for dr cp dr fp sr cp sr fp am cp and am fp respectively this indicated that these doses were sufficient enough to accommodate separable impurities of investigated wastewater coagulant combinations however these values were quite lower than the values reported by patel and vashi 49 it shows that optimum dose of seed powder which gave the lowest residual turbidity was dependent on the type of investigated wastewaters the addition of these optimized dose in wastewater made the residual turbidity value down to 63 144 14 9 32 58 4 134 5 and 34 ntu respectively of dr cp sr cp am cp dr fp sr fp and am fp respectively these results revealed that the effect of size of prepared coagulant powders was negligible when investigated with dr wastewater on the other hand decreased amount of fine coagulant powders was required when investigated with sr and am wastewater samples overall the results indicated that textile effluent s treatment efficiency was significantly affected by the coagulant dose 3 5 effect of sedimentation time the effect of sedimentation time on the coagulation flocculation performance was analyzed at optimized operational conditions i e ph and dose of coagulants the time at which either the turbidity levels become stagnant or minimum was considered as the optimum sedimentation time fig 8 shows the plots of residual turbidity vs time for all the studied wastewater coagulants combinations the optimum sedimentation time were recorded as 300 240 60 60 120 and 120 min for dr cp dr fp sr cp sr fp am cp and am fp combinations respectively these optimum sedimentation times were much lower than the reported values for azadirachta indica 72 h and cicer arietinum 48 h coagulants respectively 13 3 6 changes in cod levels at standard and optimized sedimentation time in this study the cod levels were also measured to determine the efficacy of studied coagulation flocculation treatment the cod measurements were done for the treated water samples at standard 30 min and optimized sedimentation time fig 9 shows the cod values for untreated and treated water samples of studied wastewater coagulants combinations the cod analysis results revealed that more than half of the cod was destroyed in dr wastewater samples at 30 min with both the coagulants in particular with respect to dr wastewater cp and fp showed similar potential at 30 min sedimentation time as evidenced by cod removal of 61 while increased cod levels were observed for both the powders at optimized sedimentation time it is important to mention here that although minimum or stagnant turbidity levels were achieved at optimized sedimentation time but a significant increase in cod levels was observed for both the powders such increased levels of cod may be attributed to the chemical release by the settled coagulant sludge shan et al 2017 these results were in well accordance of previous studies performed on m oleifera powders this can also be considered as one the process limitations however it can be overcome by establishing a trade off between turbidity color removal and required cod reduction with regard to sr wastewater cp showed the similar behavior at 30 min and optimized sedimentation time and cod removal was accounted as 40 on the other side although reduced cod removal cod performance 23 was observed at 30 min sedimentation but an increasing trend of cod removal was observed at optimized sedimentation time and it was accounted as 34 in case of am wastewater cp and fp both were observed to ineffective at 30 min sedimentation time with a cod removal of 12 and 19 respectively these results revealed that it is not mandatory that increasing the settling time may increase or decrease the cod of the treated effluent and it depends on the type of wastewater chosen and coagulant used in the process whereas commercial coagulant such as alum based salts were reported to be lowering the effluent cod with increased sedimentation times overall it was observed that both the crucial operational parameters i e powder size and sedimentation time plays an important role in cod for the textile effluents 3 7 sedimentation kinetics in order to have better understanding of studied coagulation flocculation process kinetic investigations were performed by plotting the residual turbidity as a function of sedimentation time the significance of this plot lies in the fact that the slope of the tangent line drawn at any point on the curve is equal to the rate of the sedimentation a negative slope of the tangent line shows a trend of decreased particle concentration with respect to increasing sedimentation time fig 10 shows the kinetic plots of models applied for dr wastewater treated with cp and fp the kinetic analysis results revealed that sedimentation of flocculated particles followed second order model for dr wastewater the summary of kinetic data obtained from investigations are presented in table 4 the rate constant values for this wastewater were observed as 0 0002 for both the powders the kinetic plots of sr wastewater with both the coagulant combinations revealed that sedimentation may follow first or second order kinetics as small difference was observed in coefficient of regression r2 values however the rate constant value of sr fp combination was observed to be twice of value obtained for dr cp combination these results clearly indicated that particle size matters in treatment process of sr wastewater the r2 values for am cp and am fp combinations were found to be significantly different with a calculated value of 0 9914 and 0 9014 for am cp and am fp respectively however the rate constant values were insignificantly different in this case overall the results of this study were indistinguishable with the previous studies 50 51 and revealed that the turbidity reduction followed the second order kinetic model irrespective of wastewater coagulant combinations 3 8 statistical performance analysis of cp and fp a correlation analysis was performed for all the studied combinations to examine the behavior of cp and fp with respect to cod turbidity and color removal table 5 shows the analysis results of both powders in which residual turbidity color and cod values are statistically compared for untreated and treated water the analysis results revealed that for residual turbidity the correlation values for fp and cp shows similar behavior during the treatment which was evidenced by coefficient values as 0 55 and 0 54 for fp and cp respectively further cp and fp showed a positive correlation which means higher the initial turbidity values of untreated wastewater more will be the treatment efficacy similarly with respect to residual cod a positive correlation was observed with a value of 0 60 for fp and 0 91 for cp respectively it confirms that cp has strong correlation as compared to fp in the studied treatment process which consequently indicates that higher initial cod values favors the treatment efficacy of this process on the other side fp has a lower correlation values with untreated and treated water samples with respect to residual color a negative correlation was observed with untreated and treated water these results indicate that when initial values of color will be high then low treatment efficiency will be achieved the high negative correlation value accounted as 0 93 observed for fp while for cp this value was observed as 0 46 overall correlation matrix revealed that for turbidity removal both cp and fp behaved in similarly way while in case of color and cod cp was observed to be a better coagulant than fp 4 conclusions following key conclusions are derived from this research study the characterization results of cp and fp revealed that both the powders have tendency to produce a reasonable amount of sludge as observed by swelling ratio of 38 cp and 42 6 fp respectively the optimum coagulation flocculation ph was observed as 6 5 7 5 and 8 for dr sr and am wastewater respectively whereas a negligible effect of powder size on optimum ph was observed in this study a dose of 3 g l was found to be sufficient enough to minimize the turbidity by cp and fp coagulant when investigated with dr wastewater whereas a decreasing trend was observed for sr cp sr fp am cp and am fp combinations with and optimized dose of 3 2 2 and 1 g l respectively the optimized sedimentation times with respect to turbidity reduction were observed as 300 240 60 60 120 and 120 min for dr cp dr fp sr cp sr fp am cp and am fp combinations respectively the cod analysis results revealed that cp and fp have similar potential at standard 30 min sedimentation time however increased cod levels were observed with both the powders at optimized sedimentation time the sr wastewater showed similar cod removal potential with cp at standard sedimentation time whereas increased cod removal 23 34 was observed with fp coagulant with respect to am wastewater both cp and fp showed increasing trend of cod removal 12 34 and 19 25 at standard and optimized sedimentation time respectively kinetics investigations revealed that particle sedimentation followed a second order kinetics in all the studied combinations the highest rate constant value was observed as 0 0008 for am cp combination correlation analysis showed that cp behaved as better coagulant than fp with respect to residual cod color and turbidity achieved declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

spectroscopy x ray diffraction analysis and zeta potential measurements the swelling ratio for cp and fp were observed as 38 and 42 6 respectively the phzpc values were found to be varying between 5 5 6 for both powders the effect of different operational parameters such as dose of coagulant 1 8 g l sedimentation time 30 360 min coagulation flocculation ph 6 9 was investigated in this study with

sedimentation kinetics 1 introduction industrialization and sustainable development are the essential needs of developing as well as developed countries 1 with respect to textile manufacturing india is considered world s second major producer of textiles and garments after china 2 the textile industry is considered as one of the water intensive industries that produces a high volume of wastewater 200 350 l of wastewater per kg of finished product in particular textile industries discharge significant quantities of surfactants fixing agents oxidizing agents recalcitrant chlorinated compounds dispersing agents smoothing agents organic dyes additives fine starch particles and some salts 3 7 which ultimately results in high turbidity colour chemical oxygen demand dissolved solids suspended solids colloids metals and organic matter in the receiving water environment 8 9 shan et al 2017 10 such effluents are also reported as potential sources of mutagenic and carcinogenic substances other negative impacts of such effluents include loss in agricultural productivity 1 11 reduced photosynthesis activities deteriorated health of humans and living creatures depleted dissolved oxygen levels and disturbance in flora and fauna 12 3 to date a significant number of textiles effluent treatment processes either removal or destructive have been reported in the literature 13 some of the well proven methods are photo electrochemical process 14 adsorption ion exchange membrane filtration 15 chemical precipitation 16 flotation biological treatment using fungi bacteria algae and bio coagulants extracted from plants 17 13 advanced oxidation processes 13 and coagulation flocculation 18 most of these processes either convert the toxic substances into non toxic substances or separate out from the aqueous phase 13 so far two categories of coagulants named synthetic mainly inorganic and natural plant based prolific sources of coagulating peptides have been discussed in literature for coagulation flocculation process based wastewater treatment 11 the first one covers mainly iron aluminum and magnesium salts poly aluminum chloride and calcium carbonate which are extensively used in textile wastewater treatment 19 some of the notable drawbacks of such coagulants include high operational cost toxic and or non biodegradable voluminous sludge generation 20 and reduced efficiencies at low temperature 10 contrary the natural coagulants polymeric macromolecules derived from plants microorganisms animals and having polysaccharides or proteins as coagulating agent have been proven of great ecological and environmental importance 20 the inevitable features of such coagulants include their biodegradability wide sources rich variety unlikely to alter the ph and conductivity of treated water 21 due to these added advantages these coagulants have garnered a particular interest of researchers particularly in textile industry effluent s treatment 22 23 moringa oleifera m oleifera a member of the moringaceae family widely adapted in tropic and subtropics sand cultivated areas of developing world has been thoroughly studied as one of the most promising natural coagulant 24 28 the seeds of m oleifera have 1 dimeric and or densely charged cationic proteins molecular mass 6 16 kda isoelectric ph 10 11 which can remove the wastewater impurities through electrostatic interaction between cationic protein and colloidal present in wastewater 10 29 30 the recent research trends revealed that the cationic proteins available in seeds can be extracted through various physical and or chemical methods such as salt based extraction precipitation delipidation centrifugation ion exchange lyophilization and membrane based separation such as dialysis 10 with the paucity of studies based on use of crude seed powder as coagulant very limited numbers of works have been carried out regarding the size effects of powder on coagulation efficiency of textile wastewaters 31 32 further most of the studies have been reported on the treatment of synthetic colored wastewaters but to the best of our knowledge there is no previous literature centered on segregated as well as mixed textile industry wastewater using m oleifera seed powder bearing these considerations in mind the present study was aimed to investigate the potential of m oleifera seed powders of different sizes for the treatment of segregated and combined mixed effluents collected from the textile industry attempts have also been made to optimize the process by way of developing formulations using combinations of different operational parameters such as coagulation flocculation ph optimum dose and sedimentation times the powders were characterized using swelling ratio point of zero charge analysis fourier transform infrared spectroscopy zeta potential measurement and x ray diffraction analysis further the rate of turbidity reduction was investigated through kinetic modeling 2 material and methods 2 1 textile industry wastewater sampling the raw textile wastewater segregated and mixed samples were collected from a nearby a cotton products based industry located at jetpur rajkot gujarat india and brought to the laboratory at marwadi university gujarat three types dye rich dr starch rich sr and all mixed am of wastewater samples were collected from various stages of textile processing as shown in fig 1 the am wastewater was particularly a mixture of effluents generated from dyeing mercerizing and bleaching process all the wastewater samples were

operating voltage of 40 kv and current 30 ma with cu kα k 1 5406 å radiation source and at room temperature the spectra were recorded in the range of 0 90 at a scan rate of 1 min 1 zeta sizer nano series nano zs 90 malvern united kingdom was used for determining the zeta potential prepared coagulant powders this instrument can measure wide range of materials in the size range of 0 6 nm to 3 microns 2 3 2 chemical 2 3 2 1 swelling studies the swelling behavior of prepared coagulants was investigated by immersion of 5 g of m oleifera seed powder in 50 ml of distilled water at 25 c for 3 d until swelling equilibrium was achieved an elongated time 3 days was used to ensure the requisite equilibrium 33 the powder weight increase allowed the calculation of the swelling percentage using eq

the phzpc measurements of prepared coagulant were conducted at varying ph an amount 0 1 g of powder was dispersed into 25 ml of 0 01 m nacl after adjusting its initial ph between 1 and 12 via adding appropriate amount of diluted acid or base 0 1 n hcl and 0 1 n naoh further the suspensions were agitated at 130 rpm in a shaker at 25 c for 24 h thereafter the final ph values were recorded the values of final ph phf were plotted against initial ph phi and phzpc was determined as intersection point of the resulting curve 32 2 4 analysis and measurements the ability of prepared coagulants was assessed by the physico chemical analysis of untreated and treated wastewater samples in terms of following parameters ph color turbidity tds tss and cod the cod analyses were performed by the

highly pure and of analytical grade and procured from merck germany and fisher scientific usa distilled water was used throughout the experiments 2 6 coagulation flocculation studies the coagulation flocculation behavior of prepared coagulants i e cp and fp with various wastewater types was investigated by a standard jar apparatus all the jar tests were performed in 1000 ml capacity beakers with a working volume of 500 ml of homogenized wastewater sample the equipment was configured for a sequential process involving a flash mixing for 2 min at a stirring speed of 100 rpm followed by slow mixing at 40 rpm for 30 min next beakers were carefully removed from the jar apparatus and the samples were allowed to settle for 30 min at room temperature these jar testing criteria were established on the basis on previous studies 13 35 performed with similar coagulant such as tamarind seed winged bean seed flamboyant seed acquapol c1 opuntia spp 36 37 31 after desired settling time supernatant samples were analyzed for selected physico chemical parameters 2 7 materials and methods the study was conducted under a controlled environment constant temperature and light intensity different operational parameters were investigated during this study to establish their influence on the coagulation flocculation process the research variables involved in this study included coagulant dosage sedimentation time and coagulation flocculation ph at the end of each experiment the supernatant was collected and analyzed in terms of residual ph and turbidity the color and cod measurements were done at optimized conditions 2 8 experimental investigations below are the details of experiments which were conducted for different wastewater and coagulants combinations dr cp sr cp am cp dr fp sr fp and am fp 2 8 1 determination of coagulation flocculation ph in this study the optimum coagulation flocculation ph was determined for studied coagulant and wastewater combinations for this purpose a fixed dose 1 g l of each coagulant was added to 500 ml of the wastewater sample with initially adjusted ph in the range of 6 9 this range of ph was chosen on the basis of values reported in previous literature 38 after performing standard jar test residual turbidity was determine the coagulation flocculation performance assessed in terms of residual turbidity the ph corresponding to minimum residual turbidity of supernatant was then considered as optimum coagulation flocculation ph 2 8 2 estimation of optimum coagulant dosage the coagulant dose optimization experiments were conducted by varying the coagulant dose at optimum ph and according to the standard jar procedure sedimentation time 30 min in this experiment a total of eight concentrations 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 g l of both the prepared coagulants were used this range was consistent with the dose reported in the literature which suggests a range of 0 5 6 0 g l 13 del real olvera et al 2016 residual turbidity of supernatant was measured from each jar experiment performed with applied dosage the dose corresponding to minimum residual turbidity was considered as optimum coagulant dose 2 8 3 effect of sedimentation time in this study the optimum sedimentation time was chosen on the basis of wastewater coagulant combination and minimum residual turbidity achieved at optimized dose the sedimentation effect on residual turbidity was studied in the range of 30 360 min floc sedimentation was evaluated by measuring the residual turbidity at different intervals for studied wastewater coagulant combinations 2 8 4 sedimentation kinetic studies to study the sedimentation kinetics three well well known kinetic models i e zero order first order and second order are used in this study table 2 12 all the kinetic investigations were done at optimized coagulant dose coagulation flocculation ph and sedimentation time 2 9 statistical analysis in this study origin pro version 8 1 was employed to present the experimental data graphically as well as to investigate the behavior of cp and fp in this regard the pearson correlation analysis was done at p 0 95 to check weather two different sizes of m oleifera seeds powder behaved in similar or different way for the treatment of wastewater samples all the statistical analysis was performed using microsoft excel 2016 3 results and discussion below sections summarize the results obtained from this research study 3 1 physico chemical characterization of prepared coagulants the phzpc and swelling ratio are among the well known crucial parameters in order to understand the coagulation process and sludge production respectively 32 33 the swelling ratio and phzpc plots of prepared m oleifera seed powders i e cp and fp are presented in fig 3 the phzpc values of both the powders were observed to be between 5 5 6 this clearly indicates that when wastewater ph phzpc the coagulation is favorable however this value was significantly different than the one reported by 39 who obtained a phzpc of 4 4 for the raw m oleifera seeds powder the swelling ratio for prepared powders were observed to be 38 and 42 6 for cp and fp respectively these ratios were observed to be approximately three times the values reported 14 2 for biochared m oleifera seeds powder such high swelling ratio may be attributed to the presence of the hydrophilic cooh groups observed between the wavelength range of 1639 63 1643 63 cm 1 33 40 however it is important to mention here that such possibilities are reported for molecularly imprinted polymer i e thiamine hydrochloride templated silylated montmorillonite itaconic acid polymer further they observed that maximum swelling is possible at ph 7 0 probably due to repulsive force between coo groups ionized at this ph similar patterns were also reported by 41 for the m oleifera cationic protein obtained from the seed powder treated clay microparticles hence detailed investigations are required in this direction to have the better understanding of swelling behavior of seed powders 3 2 instrumental characterization of prepared coagulants 3 2 1 ftir analysis the analysis of various functional groups present in prepared powder coagulants was done using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis 42 fig 4 shows the ftir analysis results of cp and fp the corresponding peaks are for specific regions that reflect the presence of functional groups attributed to stretching and bending vibrations the ftir spectra of both powders of m oleifera seeds were almost identical except for the intensity variations a total of 10 major peaks were observed in the spectra indicating a variety of functional groups within the investigated range 4000 500 cm 1 table 3 shows the peak positions of the observed functional groups the absorption peaks observed between 2950 and 2850 cm 1 were due to symmetrical and asymmetrical stretching of ch and ch2 methyl groups present in the fatty acids the peak observed between 2400 and 2420 cm 1 in spectra revealed the presence of nitrile group cn the band at 1723 cm 1 is assigned to coc bond stretching of ester group present in fatty acid and protein structures the peak at 1643 63 cm 1 may be associated with cn or nh amide sharp peak observed between 1500 and 1530 cm 1 confirmed the presence of aliphatic nitro compound these peaks also reflect the flocculating capabilities of the seed powder coagulants the peak observed between 1240 1270 cm 1 indicated presence of aromatic ether or amines stretch the moderately intense peak between 1150 and 1160 cm 1 indicated the presence of either cn stretch or ocn stretch the cp and fp exhibited out of plane c h bending vibrations below 800 cm 1 the peak at 504 cm 1 confirmed the presence of halogenated alkanes 3 2 2 xrd analysis fig 5 shows the xrd patterns of cp and fp coagulant the analysis results revealed the poorly resolved peaks which may be attributed to the predominance representing around 69 of the total mass of amorphous material such as protein and lipids content present in the used non shelled m oleifera seeds such nature of coagulant suggest that pollutants can easily penetrate the coagulant surface 45 in particular the peaks observed at 2θ 10 and 2θ 20 respectively may be responsible for semi crystalline nature of the powders 46 however it is important to mention here that the peak observed at 2θ 10 was very small as compared to 2θ 20 high peak at 2θ 20 confirms that the prepared material is mainly amorphous in nature and have a significant amount of protein structure constituents 47 although both the prepared coagulants cp and fp showed similar xrd patterns but such results may be linked with the way specifications of apparatus used for powder preparation milling such as domestic blender industrial blender specification of blades blending speed rpm and duration of blending detailed investigations in this direction may provide more insight about these patterns 3 2 3 zeta potential measurements zeta potential of the prepared cp and fp coagulants was studied at neutral ph to determine their surface charge the powder of higher sizes i e cp was observed to be having a zeta potential of 10 4 mv which clearly indicates that the surface of coagulant was dominated by positive charges further such high value of zeta potential indicate that an electrostatically stabilized suspension will remain stable this value may be attributed to the protonation of the amine and amide functional groups in cp which facilitated the movement of negatively charged colloidal particles or wastewater impurities these values were observed to be equivalent of biochared m oleifera seed powder 33 on the other side fp was observed to be having negative surface charge 1 34 which may be attributed to the release of oily material during the preparation of fine powder more specifically the coating of oily material over particle surface may facilitate the release of neutralized impurities back into the solution these findings were in good accordance with previous studies 48 3 3 coagulation flocculation ph ph is one of the most important operational factors which can be used in developing plausible mechanism for coagulation flocculation based wastewater treatment systems 13 fig 6 shows the minimum turbidity levels achieved at different ph levels for investigated wastewater and coagulant combinations the experimental results revealed that irrespective of sizes of prepared powders the optimum ph was 6 5 7 5 and 8 for dr sr and am wastewater samples respectively further experiments were conducted at these ph levels these values were found to in the range of optimum ph reported in previous studies 31 44 post experiments alkaline ph 8 5 9 0 levels were observed in treated water such conditions may be attributed to the exchange of protons in water by hydroxyl groups resulted due to presence of cationic water soluble proteins found in skin of m oleifera seeds hence the use of m oleifera seeds powder offers additional features such as negligible ph adjustment for larger full scale installation 37 3 4 effect of coagulant dosage the coagulant dose is one of the prime factors which play crucial role in evaluating the optimum parameters to ensure techno economic viability of coagulation flocculation process 13 fig 7 shows the plots of residual turbidity and dose applied for investigated wastewater coagulant combinations the experimental investigations revealed that minimum turbidity was achieved at a coagulant dose of 3 3 3 2 2 and 1 g l for dr cp dr fp sr cp sr fp am cp and am fp respectively this indicated that these doses were sufficient enough to accommodate separable impurities of investigated wastewater coagulant combinations however these values were quite lower than the values reported by patel and vashi 49 it shows that optimum dose of seed powder which gave the lowest residual turbidity was dependent on the type of investigated wastewaters the addition of these optimized dose in wastewater made the residual turbidity value down to 63 144 14 9 32 58 4 134 5 and 34 ntu respectively of dr cp sr cp am cp dr fp sr fp and am fp respectively these results revealed that the effect of size of prepared coagulant powders was negligible when investigated with dr wastewater on the other hand decreased amount of fine coagulant powders was required when investigated with sr and am wastewater samples overall the results indicated that textile effluent s treatment efficiency was significantly affected by the coagulant dose 3 5 effect of sedimentation time the effect of sedimentation time on the coagulation flocculation performance was analyzed at optimized operational conditions i e ph and dose of coagulants the time at which either the turbidity levels become stagnant or minimum was considered as the optimum sedimentation time fig 8 shows the plots of residual turbidity vs time for all the studied wastewater coagulants combinations the optimum sedimentation time were recorded as 300 240 60 60 120 and 120 min for dr cp dr fp sr cp sr fp am cp and am fp combinations respectively these optimum sedimentation times were much lower than the reported values for azadirachta indica 72 h and cicer arietinum 48 h coagulants respectively 13 3 6 changes in cod levels at standard and optimized sedimentation time in this study the cod levels were also measured to determine the efficacy of studied coagulation flocculation treatment the cod measurements were done for the treated water samples at standard 30 min and optimized sedimentation time fig 9 shows the cod values for untreated and treated water samples of studied wastewater coagulants combinations the cod analysis results revealed that more than half of the cod was destroyed in dr wastewater samples at 30 min with both the coagulants in particular with respect to dr wastewater cp and fp showed similar potential at 30 min sedimentation time as evidenced by cod removal of 61 while increased cod levels were observed for both the powders at optimized sedimentation time it is important to mention here that although minimum or stagnant turbidity levels were achieved at optimized sedimentation time but a significant increase in cod levels was observed for both the powders such increased levels of cod may be attributed to the chemical release by the settled coagulant sludge shan et al 2017 these results were in well accordance of previous studies performed on m oleifera powders this can also be considered as one the process limitations however it can be overcome by establishing a trade off between turbidity color removal and required cod reduction with regard to sr wastewater cp showed the similar behavior at 30 min and optimized sedimentation time and cod removal was accounted as 40 on the other side although reduced cod removal cod performance 23 was observed at 30 min sedimentation but an increasing trend of cod removal was observed at optimized sedimentation time and it was accounted as 34 in case of am wastewater cp and fp both were observed to ineffective at 30 min sedimentation time with a cod removal of 12 and 19 respectively these results revealed that it is not mandatory that increasing the settling time may increase or decrease the cod of the treated effluent and it depends on the type of wastewater chosen and coagulant used in the process whereas commercial coagulant such as alum based salts were reported to be lowering the effluent cod with increased sedimentation times overall it was observed that both the crucial operational parameters i e powder size and sedimentation time plays an important role in cod for the textile effluents 3 7 sedimentation kinetics in order to have better understanding of studied coagulation flocculation process kinetic investigations were performed by plotting the residual turbidity as a function of sedimentation time the significance of this plot lies in the fact that the slope of the tangent line drawn at any point on the curve is equal to the rate of the sedimentation a negative slope of the tangent line shows a trend of decreased particle concentration with respect to increasing sedimentation time fig 10 shows the kinetic plots of models applied for dr wastewater treated with cp and fp the kinetic analysis results revealed that sedimentation of flocculated particles followed second order model for dr wastewater the summary of kinetic data obtained from investigations are presented in table 4 the rate constant values for this wastewater were observed as 0 0002 for both the powders the kinetic plots of sr wastewater with both the coagulant combinations revealed that sedimentation may follow first or second order kinetics as small difference was observed in coefficient of regression r2 values however the rate constant value of sr fp combination was observed to be twice of value obtained for dr cp combination these results clearly indicated that particle size matters in treatment process of sr wastewater the r2 values for am cp and am fp combinations were found to be significantly different with a calculated value of 0 9914 and 0 9014 for am cp and am fp respectively however the rate constant values were insignificantly different in this case overall the results of this study were indistinguishable with the previous studies 50 51 and revealed that the turbidity reduction followed the second order kinetic model irrespective of wastewater coagulant combinations 3 8 statistical performance analysis of cp and fp a correlation analysis was performed for all the studied combinations to examine the behavior of cp and fp with respect to cod turbidity and color removal table 5 shows the analysis results of both powders in which residual turbidity color and cod values are statistically compared for untreated and treated water the analysis results revealed that for residual turbidity the correlation values for fp and cp shows similar behavior during the treatment which was evidenced by coefficient values as 0 55 and 0 54 for fp and cp respectively further cp and fp showed a positive correlation which means higher the initial turbidity values of untreated wastewater more will be the treatment efficacy similarly with respect to residual cod a positive correlation was observed with a value of 0 60 for fp and 0 91 for cp respectively it confirms that cp has strong correlation as compared to fp in the studied treatment process which consequently indicates that higher initial cod values favors the treatment efficacy of this process on the other side fp has a lower correlation values with untreated and treated water samples with respect to residual color a negative correlation was observed with untreated and treated water these results indicate that when initial values of color will be high then low treatment efficiency will be achieved the high negative correlation value accounted as 0 93 observed for fp while for cp this value was observed as 0 46 overall correlation matrix revealed that for turbidity removal both cp and fp behaved in similarly way while in case of color and cod cp was observed to be a better coagulant than fp 4 conclusions following key conclusions are derived from this research study the characterization results of cp and fp revealed that both the powders have tendency to produce a reasonable amount of sludge as observed by swelling ratio of 38 cp and 42 6 fp respectively the optimum coagulation flocculation ph was observed as 6 5 7 5 and 8 for dr sr and am wastewater respectively whereas a negligible effect of powder size on optimum ph was observed in this study a dose of 3 g l was found to be sufficient enough to minimize the turbidity by cp and fp coagulant when investigated with dr wastewater whereas a decreasing trend was observed for sr cp sr fp am cp and am fp combinations with and optimized dose of 3 2 2 and 1 g l respectively the optimized sedimentation times with respect to turbidity reduction were observed as 300 240 60 60 120 and 120 min for dr cp dr fp sr cp sr fp am cp and am fp combinations respectively the cod analysis results revealed that cp and fp have similar potential at standard 30 min sedimentation time however increased cod levels were observed with both the powders at optimized sedimentation time the sr wastewater showed similar cod removal potential with cp at standard sedimentation time whereas increased cod removal 23 34 was observed with fp coagulant with respect to am wastewater both cp and fp showed increasing trend of cod removal 12 34 and 19 25 at standard and optimized sedimentation time respectively kinetics investigations revealed that particle sedimentation followed a second order kinetics in all the studied combinations the highest rate constant value was observed as 0 0008 for am cp combination correlation analysis showed that cp behaved as better coagulant than fp with respect to residual cod color and turbidity achieved declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or
