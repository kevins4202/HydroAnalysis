chaoyang district p o box 9804 beijing 100029 pr china tropical instability waves tiws are the dominant mesoscale variability in the eastern equatorial pacific ocean tiws have direct impacts on the local hydrology biochemistry and atmospheric boundary layer and feedback on ocean circulations and climate variability in this study the basic characteristics of pacific ocean tiws simulated by an eddy resolving ocean model and a coupled general circulation model are evaluated the simulated tiw biases mainly result from the mean climatology state as tiws extract eddy energy from the mean potential and kinetic energy both the oceanic and coupled models reproduce the observed westward propagating large scale rossby waves between approximately 2 8 n but the simulated tiws have shorter wavelengths than the observed waves due to the shallower thermocline meanwhile the weak meridional shears of background zonal currents and the less tilted pycnocline in these two models compared to the observations causes weak barotropic and baroclinic instability which decreases the intensity of the simulated tiws we then contrast the tiws from these two models and identify the roles of atmospheric feedback in modulating tiws the latent heat flux feedback is similar to observation in the coupled model but absent in the ocean model contributing to the stronger standard deviation std of the tiw sst in the ocean model the ocean model is not able to capture realistic air sea interaction processes when forced with prescribed atmospheric forcing however the misrepresented atmospheric feedback in the ocean model tends to decrease the sea surface height ssh variability and the current feedback damping effect is stronger in the ocean model than in the coupled model combined with weaker barotropic conversion rate and baroclinic conversion rate in the ocean model than in the coupled model the std of the tiw ssh in the ocean model is weaker keywords tropical instability waves

projects cmip6 1 introduction tropical instability waves tiws are westward propagating features in sea surface temperature sst sea surface height ssh surface wind stress and ocean color perturbations miller et al 1985 bryden and brady 1989 kennan and flament 2000 delpech et al 2021 with the wavelengths of 700 1600 km lyman et al 2007 tiws are also observed in current velocities and sea surface salinity lee et al 2012a b lyman et al 2007 the intensity of tiws shows a seasonal cycle and interannual variations because the background climatology such as meridional gradients of temperature and currents exhibits a seasonal cycle and interannual variations linked with the el niño southern oscillation enso in the tropical pacific tiws appear in june and are enhanced during the boreal fall and winter farrar 2008 additionally tiws are stronger in la niña years than in el niño years zhang and busalacchi 2008 an 2008 previous studies have revealed two modes of tiws with periods of 33 days and 17 days the 33 day tiws occurring near 5 n are often referred to as the rossby mode lyman et al 2007 tanaka and hibiya 2019 while the 17 day tiws on the equator are called the yanai mode liu et al 2019 the structures of rossby and yanai modes are characterized by the first baroclinic mode of rossby waves matsuno 1966 and mixed rossby gravity waves yanai and hayashi 1969 respectively the rossby yanai mode shows symmetric anti symmetric ssh across the equator wang et al 2020 the energy source of tiws mainly originates from barotropic instability which refers to the process by which perturbations draw eddy kinetic energy from the mean kinetic energy tiws can be generated by barotropic instabilities of the meridional shear between the northern part of the south equatorial current sec n and the north equatorial counter current necc in analytical observational and numerical studies seo et al 2007a flament et al 1996 cox 1980 tanaka and hibiya 2019 kessler et al 2003 im et al 2012 although some studies have revealed additional contributions from barotropic instabilities of the meridional shear between the sec n and the eastward flowing equatorial undercurrent euc luther and johnson 1990 qiao and weisberg 1998 tanaka and hibiya 2019 previous research has also clarified the role of the baroclinic instability arising from the meridional density contrast between the cold tongue and the off equatorial warmer waters which converts eddy potential energy epe to eddy kinetic energy eke masina and philander 1999 yu et al 1995 at seasonal or interannual time scales the intensity of tiws is closely related to the changing climate background through barotropic and baroclinic instability processes the horizontal resolution of models that can resolve tiw related baroclinic instability processes should be comparable with the first order rossby deformation radius or finer hallberg 2013 in particular multiscale interactions such as tiws and large scale circulation need to be investigated further based on numerical experiments with high resolution coupled models with the horizontal resolution of 1 3 or 1 4 for the ocean bryan et al 2010 mesoscale ocean atmosphere interactions are fundamentally different from large scale air sea interactions small et al 2008 the basin scale sst is negatively correlated with surface winds indicating that the atmosphere is the driver of the ocean in other words enhanced winds tend to cool the ocean surface through evaporation hashizume et al 2002 in contrast high pass filtered ssts and wind speeds are positively correlated indicating that the ocean is a driver of the atmosphere mainly through surface heat fluxes released from the ocean to the atmosphere mantua et al 1997 momentum mixing and pressure gradient mechanisms are two main hypotheses explaining how surface wind responds to mesoscale sst perturbations hayes et al 1989 proposed that the air column becomes unstable when it blows from cold water to a warm surface enhancing turbulent mixing and vertical momentum mixing lindzen and nigam 1987 proposed that hydrostatic atmosphere pressure gradients occur when forced with sst gradients both of these mechanisms can explain the accelerated decelerated winds over warm cold waters at the tiw scale small et al 2008 the properties of tiws can be modulated by both intrinsic instability processes in the ocean and air sea interactions because the surface wind stress is computed from the 10 m surface wind relative to the oceanic surface current ocean eddies influence surface stresses via ocean surface current and sst gradient induced wind variations small et al 2009 two types of air sea interactions were introduced in small et al 2008 and renault et al 2019 thermal feedback tfb and current feedback cfb tfb refers to the wind stress curl and latent heat flux response induced by the sst of tiws the cfb can be accounted for by using the wind relative to the oceanic current instead of the absolute wind ignoring surface motion cfb refers to the current modified wind stress signature which is equivalent to the difference of eq 1 minus eq 2 the wind stress curl modification caused by both tfb and cfb can modulate the off equatorial ssh for rossby tiws through ekman dynamics moreover small et al 2008 points out that it is very difficult to distinguish the wind stress curl modification caused by the sst of tiws from that caused by ocean currents renault et al 2019 carried out three simulations differed by the coupling effects they are resolving with or without the mesoscale tfb and the cfb we devise a way to isolate the tfb s effect the bulk formula for wind stress adopted in fgoals f3 h and licom3 is given in eq 1 and we recalculate a reference wind stress τ m based on eq 2 the relationship with this newly modified τ m and mesoscale sst or ssh can help to discuss the tfb separately 1 τ ρ 0 c d u a u c u a u c τ x τ y 2 τ m ρ 0 c d u a u a τ mx τ my where u a and u c denote the atmospheric wind at 10 m and the surface current respectively the air density near the sea surface ρ 0 equals 1 29 kg m 3 c d is the drag coefficient which is estimated from the so called bulk formula as a function of surface wind sea surface temperature and surface air temperature the mesoscale tfb results in wind speed perturbations that covary with the evolving sst perturbations posing negative feedbacks on the growth of sst perturbations by tiws mainly through latent heat flux loss seo et al 2007a the tfb induced wind stress can be accompanied by changes in wind derivatives wind stress curl divergence perturbations have been shown to be linearly dependent on the crosswind along wind component of the sst gradients for mesoscale air sea interactions chelton et al 2004 the existing research shows that this tfb can also generate wind stress curl perturbations that affect the spread of eddies in the coastal stream of california the location of the great whirl in the arabian sea and the latitude of the branch of the somali current seo et al 2016 seo 2017 in the eastern equatorial pacific the wind stress curl response to the tfb and its possible influence on the eddy magnitude have received little attention cfb is another part of the mesoscale air sea interaction because the surface wind stress is parameterized based on the relative velocity at the sea surface mesoscale oceanic eddies tend to dominate the variation in the wind stress curl anomalies in areas where ocean currents are relatively large for instance the cyclonic wind stress curl corresponds to anticyclone oceanic eddies note the minus sign in front of ocean current in 1 which can cause ekman pumping and the resultant cold water upwelling leads to a negative feedback to the original positive ssh small et al 2009 seo and xie 2011 seo et al 2006 these wind stress curls involving the wind speed relative to the ocean current suggest negative feedback on the mesoscale ssh through ekman dynamics cfb is also called top drag dewar and flierl 1987 and eddy killing renault et al 2016 because it can lead to kinetic energy losses of 30 for mesoscale eddies in high resolution models renault et al 2020 because tiws are not fully resolved in models with a resolution coarser than 100 km previous numerical studies on tiws have mainly been based on high resolution global or regional climate models bryan et al 2010 some biases appear in climate models when simulating the intensity of tiws and mesoscale interactions lin et al 2019 evaluated ocean mesoscale air sea interactions in a fully coupled high resolution model using licom2 liu et al 2012 with a resolution of 10 km and other components of the community earth system cesm version 1 0 they concluded that the responses of the wind stress to the eddy induced sst anomalies are weaker in the simulation than in the observations and that the latent heat flux response to mesoscale sst perturbations is overestimated in the simulation due to biases in the specific humidity the eddy kinetic energy inferred by mesoscale ssh variability increases in high resolution ocean model intercomparison project phase 2 omip 2 experiments griffies et al 2016 compared to their low resolution counterparts but is still weaker than observations chassignet et al 2020 ocean only simulations that adopt wind stress forcings calculated from wind relative to currents as in eq 1 such as ncar pop awi fesom and iap licom all show weaker eddy kinetic energy and ssh variabilities in contrast fsu hycom which adopts wind stress forcings calculated from only the 10 m atmospheric wind as in eq 2 shows weaker eddy kinetic energy and ssh variabilities than observations chassignet et al 2020 some ocean forcing datasets core jra55 do have winds adjusted toward satellite measurements which are already affected by ocean current therefore using this forcing and running the ocean model with currents in stress leads to a double counting of the current effect sun et al 2021 the purpose of the study is to evaluate the performance of fgoals f3 h in simulating tiws and to determine the role of air sea interactions in the light of differences in tiw simulations between licom3 and fgoals f3 h the effect of cfb and tfb on the tiw scale ssh and the latent heat flux response of tfb on the tiw scale sst are assessed additionally the wind stress curl response to tfb and its effect on the tiw scale ssh are analyzed to further understand the tiw scale ssh variation process section 2 describes the data and methodology used in this study section 3 presents a simple description of the large scale background circulation in the tropical pacific section 4 describes the differences in the intensity wavelength and spatial pattern of the tiws produced by the models and the observations and the role of the mean state in these differences section 5 explores the role of air sea interactions such as tfb and cfb in modulating the intensity of tiws through a comparison of simulations from licom3 and fgoals f3 h section 6 is a summary and discussion 2 data and methodology 2 1 data 2 1 1

flexible global ocean atmosphere land system finite volume version 3 fgoals f3 is a fully coupled model developed at the state key laboratory of numerical modeling for atmospheric sciences and geophysical fluid dynamics lasg institute of atmospheric physics iap chinese academy of sciences cas the four components ocean atmosphere land and ice for the high resolution version fgoals f3 h are given in detail in table 1 all tier 1 2 and 3 experiments of highresmip with fgoals f3 h are conducted and submitted to the cmip6 website and the tier 2 coupled ocean atmosphere simulations experiment which is referred to as fgoals f3 h is analyzed in this study these four components are coupled through the version 7 coupler in the community earth system model cesm craig et al 2011 the dynamic core for the atmospheric component of fgoals f3 h is a finite volume cubed sphere fv3 lin 2004 the oceanic component is the lasg iap climate system ocean model version 3 licom3 liu et al 2012 details of the orthogonal curvilinear coordinates and the tripolar grid used in licom3 can be found in yu et al 2018 the high resolution simulation of fgoals is built under the community earth system model framework an et al 2022 danabasoglu et al 2020 and the forcing fields are the same as those adopted in the cmip6 historical simulation eyring et al 2016 high frequency coupling is required for high resolution coupled runs the coupled time step is 15 min between the coupler and the atmosphere land and sea ice model components and 4 h between the coupler and the ocean model component licom3 adopts finite difference schemes to solve the primitive equations with boussinesq and hydrostatic approximations li et al 2020 the omip 2 simulation is carried out with a coupled ocean ice model in which the 1 10 degree licom3 is coupled with the community ice code version 4 cice4 hunke and lipscomb 2010 at the sea ice atmosphere interface the model is forced with freshwater heat and momentum fluxes the freshwater flux including precipitation and river runoff is from jra 55 kobayashi et al 2015 the turbulent fluxes at the surface are estimated from atmospheric state variables from jra 55 tsujino et al 2018 and sea surface temperature from ocean model the momentum fluxes are calculated using the relative velocity between the ocean and atmosphere as eq 1 which is hereafter referred to as the relative wind stress the u a comes from the atmospheric component of fgoals f3 h for the fgoals f3 h and the jra 55 reanalysis dataset for the licom3 in other words in the coupled model the relative wind effect can affect atmosphere wind via modifying the stress but in the omip experiment it cannot alter the wind to avoid vagueness we define τ m in eq 2 as the absolute wind stress which is used to isolate the effect of surface currents on the wind stress curl in section 5 to distinguish it from the relative wind stress τ in eq 1 all forcing variables are updated every 6 h the vertical mixing parameterization schemes adopted in fgoals f3 h and licom3 are the same the applied parameterization scheme can be found in li et al 2021 which includes the tidal mixing scheme st laurent et al 2002 the buoyancy frequency related thickness diffusivity scheme ferreira et al 2005 the vertical viscosity and diffusion scheme canuto et al 2001 and the chlorophyll a dependent solar penetration scheme lin et al 2007 the daily output variables in this study include the latent heat flux the meridional wind stress the zonal wind stress the wind stress curl at a height of 10 m the ocean potential temperature the sea surface height ocean currents sea level pressure and the near surface specific humidity at a height of 2 m analysis is done for the period 1999 to 2008 as all the datasets covered this period data are linearly interpolated to a 1 4 resolution for convenient comparison before analysis 2 2 identifying the rossby mode previous studies have demonstrated that observed tiws have symmetric ssh structures across the equator for the rossby mode and anti symmetric ssh structures for the yanai mode wang et al 2020 this trait can be used to separate these two modes the cross power spectral density c psd of the ssh at 2 n and 2 s is calculated by multiplying the fourier transform at 2 n and complex conjugate of fourier transform at 2 s and the time series must be normalized prior to analysis positive negative c psd values indicate that these two series have positive negative covariance values at the given frequency specifying the filter range for the rossby mode yanai mode hence the c psd of the ssh across the equator can give the specific frequency bands to distinguish the two tiw modes the tiw signals for the rossby mode are filtered over periods of 25 to 40 days and between wavelengths of 950 and 3000 km via 2d discrete fast fourier transform farrar 2008 and the results are denoted with a prime hereafter 2 3 joint empirical orthogonal function eof analysis the joint empirical orthogonal function eof is also called the multivariate eof meof method lee et al 2012 liang et al 2018 it has been widely used for investigating large scale atmospheric and coupled oceanic variability structures with this method the correlation patterns of two data matrices that are examples of different structures or state vectors and that share a common sampling dimension can be identified in practice two filtered variables are placed into one matrix such as the matrix shown below the eof is then performed on the covariance matrix with each variable normalized by the square root of its global mean variance first x a 11 a 12 a m 1 a m 2 a 1 n a mn b 11 b 12 b m 1 b m 1 b 1 n b mn where a stands for the ssh b represents the sst and a mn and b mn indicates that the ssh and sst locating at point m from time n respectively 2 4 definition of the tiw index we adopt the definition of the tiw index used in boucharel and jin 2019 to show the propagation of tiws according to their definition choosing different numbers and locations of points and moving them altogether in the zonal direction within the active region of tiws does not influence the result however the interval l between selected points is predefined based on the complex eof or other statistical methods xue et al 2021 l is the space between the adjacent sst anomaly ssta points which is equal to half of the tiw wavelength in degrees this tiw index has been proven to be effective in capturing the propagating tiw signals for the rossby mode xue et al 2021 based on joint eof analysis of the ssh and the sst fig 1 we estimate the wavelength from eof mode 1 and obtain values of 1225 km 11 980 km 8 8 and 817 km 7 2 for the observations fgoals f3 h and licom3 respectively therefore different spacing between the selected ssta points for licom3 fgoals f3 h and the observations are used because the tiws in these datasets have different wavelengths the ssta is calculated from the climatological daily mean from 1999 to 2008 in this study the sstas at eight points are summed from equally spaced points with weights with nodes at peaks and troughs of tiws so that the weights have alternating sign e g 1 for peaks and 1 for troughs the formula is shown below as eq 3 which is the same as eq 1 in boucharel and jin 2019 3 tiw t ssta t nodes 2 5 energy analysis when the temporal tendency is ignored the time mean eddy kinetic energy eke budget can be written as masina and philander 1999 seo et al 2007b 4 u eke u eke u p g ρ w ρ 0 u u u ρ 0 a h u 2 u ρ 0 u a v u z z τ z u surface where capital letters represent 60 day averages as running means and the bolded letters represent three dimensional vectors u u v w u is 60 day averaged u and prime indicates that the variable is filtered over the rossby mode range before analysis subscripted variables denote partial differentiation in the z axis directions x y z brackets indicate the annual mean w is the filtered ocean velocity components in the vertical direction τ is the filtered wind stress vector ρ is calculated from the potential temperature and salinity the constant ρ 0 equals 1025 kg m 3 a h and a v are the horizontal and vertical viscosities respectively g denotes acceleration due to gravity the left terms of eq 4 denote the advection of eke from the mean currents and the eddy current the first term on the right side is the vertical and horizontal radiation of energy and the second term represents the baroclinic conversion rate bcr the third term is the barotropic conversion rate btr with the dominant term being ρ 0 u v u y wang et al 2020 xue et al 2021 the btr refers to the kinetic energy conversion from the mean kinetic energy to the eke due to meridional shear between the sec n and necc and between the sec n and euc the bcr indicates the energy conversion from the epe to the eke cox 1980 masina and philander 1999 qiao and weisberg 1998 which depends on salinity temperature and pressure in the ocean the fourth and fifth terms indicate the horizontal and vertical dissipation respectively of eke by the eddies the last term denotes the mechanical energy input by the surface wind stress in the coupling process and acts as a kinetic energy sink source when the angle between the wind and the current is larger smaller than 90 the term on the left side and the first fourth and fifth terms on the right side are negligible in terms of their annual means seo et al 2007a wang et al 2017 illustrated that the peak values of the annual averaged bcr coincide with the sharpest meridional temperature gradient in the subsurface layer and the annual averaged btr values peaking at 2 n and 4 n correspond to the largest shear between the euc and the necc and the shear between the sec n and the necc respectively therefore we vertically integrate the remaining dominant term between the surface and h 150 m to quantitatively compare the mesoscale feedbacks and the rectified effects based on the difference in the large scale circulations the integration is done from the surface to 150 m and other depths of 50 m 180 m and 200 m are selected to assess the dependence of the results on the depth the fundamental pattern of btr and bcr are not sensitive to the depth the formula is shown below 5 btr h 1 h sfc ρ 0 u v u y dz 6 bcr h 1 h sfc g ρ w dz 7 couple h 1 h sfc τ z u surface dz positive negative btr or bcr values imply an increased decreased eke the btr and bcr can be combined into one term called the intrinsic energy conversion rate icr by the intrinsic instabilities which serve as an energy source for tiws the difference in the icr can be regarded as the rectified effect based on the difference in the large scale circulations the coupling term reflects the stress feedback damping term result from the interaction between the current modified stress by the tiws with the tiw surface current which serves as an energy sink for tiws because tiw induced winds are usually reversed to surface currents small et al 2009 3 large scale circulations in the tropical pacific the properties of tiws can be altered by both intrinsic ocean instability mechanisms and air sea interactions in the tropics the mean state of ocean currents and temperatures can influence eddy energy generation and is therefore of particular interest to our study meanwhile the biases in simulated currents are closely associated with biases in the ssh sst thermocline depth and wind stress for example sun et al 2019 states that the necc biases in the second phase of the coordinated ocean ice reference experiments core ii forced parallel ocean program version 2 and the coupled community earth system mode models cesm can be attributed to the adoption of relative wind stress forcings which is considered repeatedly in both the model flux formula and the reanalysis data with the latter having already been adjusted toward satellite data moreover because the sec and necc are in thermal wind balance with the thermocline trough along 4 n a greater temperature gradient in the meridional direction along the north and south slope of the thermocline accompanying the deeper thermocline is usually linked with a strong current and meridional current shear the systematic errors in the current wind stress and temperature are closely related with each other therefore comprehensively evaluating the ability of high resolution versions of ocean models and coupled gcms is necessary to simulate the large scale circulation in the tropical pacific the climatological field of the surface wind stress sea surface temperature sst and sea surface height ssh in the tropical pacific from observations licom3 and fgoals f3 h are given in fig 2 both fgoals f3 h and licom3 can reproduce the observed large scale patterns in the sst and ssh in the tropical pacific but with a weaker west east gradient fig 2 this west east contrast in the pacific is related to zonal winds and currents and is important for the mean state of the coupled system due to the underestimated trade winds and vertical mixing effects the thermocline is less steeply tilted and more diffuse in fgoals f3 h and licom3 the simulated mean state of the equatorial cold tongue in fgoals f3 h is slightly weaker and located farther eastward compared to the observations the root mean square error rmse for the sst field in licom3 and noaa oisst is 0 2 c and it is 0 9 c for fgoals f3 h but the meridional sst gradients from these two models are quite similar to observations figure s2 the zonal wind stress in the equatorial region 0 180 90 w from licom3 and fgoals f3 h is 22 and 26 smaller than the quikscat observations respectively the positive wind stress curl band between 2 n and 8 n is also weaker in the model simulations fig 3b c the observed positive wind stress curl band tends to induce strong upwelling and sharp temperature gradients in the vertical direction we diagnose the individual contributions from the surface wind stress to the zonal transport of necc following the equation ψ y deduced in sun et al 2019 2021 where ψ 1 β x y x c u r l τ d x ψ is the stream function of vertically integrate volume transport and the values of ψ along the coast of the americas are assigned to 0 fig 3 illustrates the zonal transport due to wind stress the upper 400 m vertically integrated zonal currents 0 400 m u dz is also given in fig 3 the figure shows that positive negative zonal sverdrup transport due to wind stress corresponds to a westward eastward current sun et al 2021 verifies that the correct simulation of the wind stress curl is the main factor in determining the simulation of the necc the westward transport in the necc region is weaker than that in the observations and it is the same for the vertically integrated volume transport fig 3 the necc currents along 120 w in licom3 and fgoals f3 h are 0 1 and 0 25 m s respectively which are both weaker than those from soda approximately 0 4 m s fig 4b c hence we conclude that the underestimation of necc transport in licom3 and fgoals f3 h can be attributed to weaker wind stress curl the thermocline is less steeply tilted between 5 n and 10 n and more diffuse in models compared with observations fig 4 and the thermocline is much more diffuse in fgoals f3 h than in licom3 the epe is converted from available potential energy ape and the ape of the mean state can be estimated from the north southward inclination of thermocline on vertical sections without considering the contributions from salinity fig 4 indicates that the simulated ape is weaker than observations if we also take salinity into account the pycnocline along 140 w figure s3 shows that the isopycnal surface is more flat in licom3 than in fgoals f3 h which is consistent with the conclusion drawn from vertical temperature sections fig 4 in general both licom3 and fgoals f3 h give realistic representations of the mean state of the tropical pacific climate regarding the horizontal structure of the sst and ssh but the weaker necc and the density stratification are likely to impact tiws intensity and it will be discussed in the next section 4 temporal and spatial evolution of tropical instability waves rossby mode and yanai mode can be separated based on c psd of ssh wang et al 2020 states that joint eof analysis between filtered ssh and sst values can separate the rossby and yanai modes the two leading eofs of licom3 and fgoals f3 h are two rossby modes with a 90 phase shift fig 1 however the 3rd and 4th modes of the eof decomposition for the models display features of both the rossby and yanai modes not shown indicating the two modes in models are not orthogonal also the yanai mode in the model simulations is weak and its spectra are notably different from the observed spectra fig 5 therefore we just discuss the filtered rossby mode signals only to ensure the authenticity of the results the intensity of tiws is gauged through the standard deviation std of the spatially and temporally filtered time series at each grid point from the ssh sst zonal current and meridional current data fig 6 specifically for the sst both models reproduce the correct latitudes of the maximum amplitudes at approximately 2 n but yield a weaker sst associated tiw amplitude the maximum std for the ssh due to the tiw variability in licom3 and fgoals f3 h is 1 6 cm and 2 6 cm both of which are less than that in the gridded satellite data product aviso 3 8 cm the surface current near the equator can be seen as quasi geostrophic balanced and as linearly dependent on the ssh holmes et al 2014 because the std of the ssh is smaller in the ocean only and coupled models the std of the ocean currents is also smaller fig 6h k the std of filtered surface current from oscar is shown in fig 6g j in which the std excessing 0 06 m s generally covers large areas than in licom3 but the figure for the observations is a little smaller in equatorial areas than that for fgoals f3 h this is probably because the observed zonal current estimated from the satellite ssh reveals large bias near the equator as the high frequency zonal and meridional currents in oscar are inaccurate johnson et al 2007 in conclusion both the ocean and coupled models underestimate the intensity of tiws with regard to the std of the ssh and sst previous studies have investigated the std of the mesoscale sst and ssh in models and possible reasons for their biases by comparing the results from a high resolution global environmental model higem1 2 and its low resolution version hadgem1 2 shaffrey et al 2009 attributed the low std of the ssh in hadgem1 2 to the unresolved baroclinic instability processes that generate the eddies the maximum variance in the sst in higem1 2 is further west and weaker than that in the observations due to the strength and location of the climatological mean temperature and velocity gradients roberts et al 2009 despite efforts to clarify the effect of increasing the resolution to enhance the mesoscale activity few studies have analyzed the comprehensive changes in the characteristics of tiws such as wavelength intensity time and spatial variations in relation to different mean climate states in eddy resolving experiments and the corresponding causes the climatological mean state can usually be improved as the ocean model s resolution increases bryan et al 2010 which contributes to the enhanced mesoscale activity a weaker necc will cause a weaker current shear in the meridional direction and decrease the generation of barotropic instabilities the bias in the thermocline depth indicates less ape for baroclinic instability conversions fig 4 as a result the weaker current shear and the diffuse thermocline in the model simulations see section 3 will lead to an insufficient energy supply and favor weakened tiws the intensity of tiws is also different from the observations in terms of the locations and spatial ranges of the maxima fig 6a and d clearly illustrate that the longitudinal coverage of the observed std values at 2 n over 0 18 c for the sst and 1 4 cm for the ssh is from 180 to 100 w in contrast it becomes narrower in the models only from 150 w to 110 w in addition to the tiws intensity the simulated wavelengths of tiws from licom3 and fgoals f3 h are 817 km 7 2 980 km 8 8 which is also shorter than 1225 km 11 for the observations fig 7b based on the joint eof analysis of the ssh and sst fig 1 fig 7 shows the regressions of the daily sst and ssh onto the standardized tiw index the definition of which can be found in section 2 the selected ssta points are denoted as asterisks and crossed circles for negative and positive weights respectively in fig 7 the propagation of tiws clearly exhibits regular westward propagating wavelike features the phase difference between the ssh and ssta along 0 10 n resembles that in the observations it is necessary to qualitatively understand why the tiw wavelengths in licom3 and fgoals f3 h are shorter and why the tiw intensity is weaker compared to the observations from the perspective of baroclinic instability dynamics the rossby mode structures are characterized by the first baroclinic mode of rossby waves matsuno 1966 and we calculate the typical stability properties of a specific configuration following eady s solution eady 1949 according to chapter 6 5 in vallis 2017 the characteristic spatial scales of the instability are characterized by the rossby deformation radius l d where l d nh f 0 h equals the thermocline depth f 0 is the coriolis parameter and n is the brunt väisala frequency where n g ρ ρ z g is the acceleration due to gravity and ρ ρ z equals the density gradient between the ocean surface and the thermocline the length scales of the maximum instability for the ocean are nearly four times the deformation radius l d the eady growth rate can be qualitatively calculated according to σ e 0 3 δ u l d where δ u is the vertical shear between the surface and the thermocline not surprisingly the rossby mode of the tiws in these two models has a shorter wavelength and a weaker intensity because as shown in fig 4 both fgoals f3 h and licom3 reveal an overall bias in reproducing the thermocline depth meridional sst gradient and current shear at 5 n the thermocline depths characterized by the 20 degree isotherm are approximately 100 m 120 m and 135 m in licom3 fgoals f3 h and the observations respectively fig 4 the shallow thermocline and associated vertical temperature gradient can cause a smaller deformation radius shorter wavelength and weaker ape the necc is weak due to the weak wind stress curl biases causing weak meridional shear of the zonal current that generates the btr even though the current shear is nonuniform the above figures estimated at 2 n 120 w and shown in table 2 still provide us with a quantitative understanding of the scale and growth rate of tiws the l d values are 372 9 km and 299 5 km for fgoals f3 h and licom3 respectively which are all shorter than the soda values 397 3 km the simulated buoyancy frequencies are almost identical in these two models and slightly smaller than the observations meanwhile the instability growth rate for the model simulations is significantly smaller than it is for the observations which is largely due to the smaller vertical shear the weak eady growth rate causes the weak tiw intensity the above analysis explains the discrepancy in the wavelength and intensity of tiws from the systematic errors of the climatology the underestimated tiws mainly result from the weak shear of the tropical current system and shallow thermocline which lead to decreased barotropic and baroclinic instabilities the bias of the shallow thermocline and weak vertical temperature gradient in the model simulations also leads to shorter wavelengths which are favorable to the growth of instabilities in addition to the intensity and wavelength differences mentioned above we applied a joint eof to the ssh and sst during 1999 2008 in the active tiw region 125 w 115 w 5 n 5 s to illustrate the spatial patterns of the tiw rossby mode because tiws are propagating waves eofs come in pairs to represent propagation and the first and second principal components pcs represent the rossby mode wang et al 2020 only the regression onto the first pc is shown because the regression patterns of the first two pcs are very similar we perform a lead lag 14 day cross regression between the variable and the first pc to obtain a larger picture of tiw propagation in the pacific fig 8 the observed rossby modes fig 8a induce northwest southeast nw se velocity ssh oscillations and northeast southwest ne sw sst oscillations which is consistent with other studies liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 the sst values peak at approximately 0 24 c at 2 n and the ssh peak is approximately 3 cm at 5 n the equatorial ocean surface current satisfies the quasi geostrophic balance so the surface current is almost parallel to the ssh contour lines clockwise oceanic eddies correspond to positive ssh values north of the equator and anticlockwise oceanic eddies correspond to positive ssh values south of the equator the spatial patterns of the rossby mode described above are realistically reproduced in model simulations fig 8b c the magnitudes of the regression coefficients represent the strengths of the oscillations related to the sst ssh and surface currents of the tiws the simulated intensities of the sst and ssh are all weaker than the observations which is consistent with fig 6 5 energetics of tiws and role of air sea interactions 5 1 energy budget analysis the numerical experiments with licom3 can be regarded as the oceanic responses to the surface forcing from the jra 55 dataset including the momentum and buoyancy fluxes without atmospheric feedback unlike fgoals f3 h which involves two way interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere the tiw induced tfb which relates to the heat flux and wind stress curl field is absent in licom3 this missing feedback may contribute to the distinct characteristics of the tiws in licom3 to a certain extent in addition to the contributions from the icr which are dependent on the large scale mean state hence a comparison from the energy analysis of the simulations from licom3 and fgoals f3 h should help reveal the influence of mesoscale feedback on the intensity of tiws and the influence of the climatological background btr and bcr observations are not available due to a lack of daily three dimensional and high resolution observation datasets for ocean currents therefore the focus of this subsection is on the sensitivity of tiw energetics in the models to background state we vertically integrate the btr bcr and couple as shown in eqs 5 7 for fgoals f3 h and licom3 the btr for fgoals f3 h is considerably higher than that for licom3 the bcrs from fgoals f3 h is bigger than from licom3 fig 9 shaffrey et al 2009 found that the meridional range of tiw related sst variability depends on the locations of meridional shear between the euc and sec n similarly both the simulated necc and sec n are weaker in the central pacific fig 4 where the meridional shear of zonal velocity is weaker as well specifically the meridional shear values at 2 n 120 w are 0 64 s 1 0 46 s 1 and 0 33 s 1 for soda fgoals f3 h and licom3 respectively leading to lower levels of barotropic instabilities and a smaller longitudinal coverage of sst in ocean model than coupled model and observation the bcr in licom3 are weaker than in fgoals f3 h because the small ape result from the bias in the mean state of the pycnocline depth figure s3 figure s4 shows that contribution from temperature to bcr figure s4c and s4d is more important than the contribution from salinity figure s4e and s4f in both licom3 and fgoals f3 h the stronger icr in fgoals f3 h than in licom3 can partly explain the stronger std of ssh but cannot illustrate the weaker std of sst in fgoals f3 h than in licom3 the coupling term is negative for both fgoals f3 h and licom3 with a considerably larger damping for fgoals f3 h this result indicates that currents cause a greater damping on wind stress in fgoals f3 h than in licom3 however the stronger energy sink in fgoals f3 h is probably for the sake of achieving balance with the stronger energy source due to the icr in the context of the long term climatological mean in summary we apply long term averaged eke analysis to assess the energy sources and sinks of tiws from a statistically balanced result between the mechanic production term icr and other dissipation terms fgoals f3 h exhibits a stronger icr than licom3 because of the discrepancies in the climate mean states thus the std of the ssh in fgoals f3 h is stronger than that in licom3 fig 6e f however the std of the sst in the former is slightly weaker than that in the latter fig 6b c this suggests the causes of the difference in the variances of the sst from these two models cannot be simply attributed to the differences in the icr as a result of the different mean states the coupling term which represents the effect of the correlation between currents and wind stresses is the dominant sink for the tiw eke in addition the air sea heat flux also affects the energy budget indirectly because the heat flux affects the sst and then the wind stress is affected by the sst therefore the role of tfb is analyzed below 5 2 heat flux and wind stress curl response to the tfb the focus of this part is the role of tfb and cfb in causing the difference in the intensity of tiws in licom3 and fgoals f3 h the icr and feedback of the relative wind stress curl response absolute wind stress curl response and the latent heat response to the tfb can only be qualitatively calculated and compared for high resolution datasets from fgoals f3 h and licom3 in this section we will investigate the role of air sea interactions in influencing the sst variability and the influence of mesoscale feedbacks on ssh variability the accelerated winds over warm waters associated with mesoscale perturbations lead to an increased latent heat flux and sensible heat flux which cause more heat to be lost through surface sensible and latent heat flux exchange thum et al 2002 describes the response of the magnitude and distribution of the sensible and latent heat fluxes across the sst front based on tao moorings both fluxes exert negative feedback on the tiw sst perturbations in this area latent heat flux perturbations are the primary contributor with typical magnitudes of 33 wm 2 c 1 of sst perturbations in comparison to the 4 wm 2 c 1 for the sensible heat flux thum et al 2002 small et al 2008 the pattern of latent heat flux induced by tfb wind stress is almost in phase with the sst perturbations the latent heat flux is proportional to the wind speed and air sea humidity difference with the product of the atmospheric density and exchange coefficient being the linear coefficient the meso scale air sea humidity difference contribute to most of the difference in the air sea heat flux feedback between the coupled and ocean only simulations figure s5 the tfb induced wind speed at 0 5 n also plays an important role in depressing the tiw related sst perturbations through the latent heat flux perturbations we regress the sst and filtered wind speed onto the sst at a fixed location 2 n 120 w for the 1999 2008 period fig 10 note that this fixed location is chosen in regions where the sst variance is the highest the coupling strength between the wind speed and the sst is strong in fgoals f3 h with a peak of 1 m s c at 120 w fig 10b higher than the figures for observations a positive correlation between the sst and the filtered wind speed perturbations exists for each grid point and the correlation coefficients exhibit a maximum of 0 9 at approximately 0 5 n not shown in fgoals f3 h however licom3 fails to reproduce these positive correlations correctly at the same locations as licom3 sst cannot affect wind air temperature and humidity the regression pattern of the filtered latent heat flux onto the filtered air sea humidity difference indicates that the latent heat flux induced negative feedback suppresses the sst in fgoals f3 h and the observations and this negative feedback is missing in licom3 fig 11a b the negative feedback is stronger in the eastern pacific for fgoals f3 h than for observations the above analysis explains why the std of the sst for fgoals f3 h is weaker than that for licom3 and also weaker than those observed fig 6b c the relative wind stress response can be accompanied by changes in the wind stress curl modifying the ssh of tiws through ekman dynamics the absolute wind stress curl response is separated from the whole mesoscale feedbacks and discussed first to understand why the std of the ssh in licom3 is weaker than that in fgoals f3 h recall the spatial patterns of the ssh sst ocean current and wind stress field for the rossby mode fig 8a the rossby mode has a preferred oscillation direction characterized by northwest southeastward nw se velocity and ssh oscillations and northeast southwestward ne sw sst oscillations between 0 10 n fig 8a specifically the warm sst is surrounded by anticyclonic oceanic eddies on the left and cyclonic oceanic eddies on the right the accelerated wind speed over the warm sea surface will affect the negative ssh via the wind stress curl the pattern of the induced wind stress curl patterns resulting from tfb solely in the pacific has never been clearly illustrated before and is discussed in this section to separate the onefold influence of the tfb induced wind stress curl on ekman pumping a 10 m atmospheric wind field is used to calculate a new absolute wind stress as shown in eq 2 which is denoted as τ m the regression of τ m to the single point sst at 2 n 120 w can be seen as the wind stress curl in response to the sst alone fig 12 the tfb is given by fig 12b d f and the cfb is given by fig 12a minus 12b 12c minus 12d 12e minus 12f fig 12d shows that the positive sst at 2 n results in the cyclonic wind stress curl and causes ekman pumping for fgoals f3 h the upwelling leads to cold subsurface temperature perturbations resulting in a negative ssh at approximately 5 n fig 13b in other words for fgoals f3 h the wind stress curl response to the sst at 2 n acts as a positive feedback to the ssh at approximately 5 n however because surface wind fields are external forcings from the jra 55 dataset without any relationship with the sst in the licom3 simulations no such positive feedback exists for the ssh fig 12f however the absolute wind stress curl calculated from the era5 seems to have no impact on the ssh at 5 n fig 12b to understand the relationship between the ssh and the wind stress curl perturbations the regression coefficients between the ssh and sea level pressure perturbations slp and the precipitation pr are shown in figs 13 and 14 because the rotational wind field directly arises from the sst patterns through the momentum mixing and or pressure gradient mechanism a positive pr and a negative slp is linked with a cyclonic wind field at the sea surface the regression of pr and slp onto the single point sst at 2 n 120 w supports that the wind stress response to the tfb is a positive feedback on the ssh for fgoals f3 h for the observations the positive and negative centers of the pr oscillations are located at the zero line of the ssh which means that mesoscale sst poses a negligible impact on the ssh via wind stress this analysis is consistent with previous regressions on the filtered absolute wind stress curl fig 12b even though the phase difference between the precipitation response for fgoals f3 h and the observations is approximately 2 the pattern is totally changed the pattern of the precipitation response is misrepresented for fgoals f3 h with negative pr and positive slp values overlapping positive ssh values figs 13b 14b and forming anti cyclonic circulation to strengthen the positive ssh because near the equator f 0 and ocean flow is accelerated in the direction of the wind stress in contrast this misrepresented positive feedback toward the ssh in fgoals f3 h is absent in licom3 because sst variations do not feedback to the atmosphere and induce wind variations moreover the intensity of the precipitation response for fgoals f3 h is stronger than that for the observations which means stronger anti cyclonic circulation above the positive ssh this phenomenon increases the ssh variability in fgoals f3 h bao and li 2020 indicated that the high resolution amip run of fgoals f3 has a larger positive bias in precipitation than the low resolution run which may be due to a lack of specific tuning of the sub grid parameterization schemes for the high resolution agcm this precipitation bias still exists in fgoals f3 h as illustrated in the introduction the wind stress curl response to cfb also influences the mesoscale ssh variability and the bias attribution of the weaker std of the ssh for licom3 than for fgoals f3 h is finally made after the evaluation of mesoscale feedback on ssh in account of both the tfb and the cfb in section 5 3 5 3 wind stress curl response considering the cfb for the wind stress curl signature considering the modification of the ocean current and sst the regression of the ekman pumping calculated using relative wind stress curl τ in eq 1 onto the single point ssh at 5 n 120 w for the rossby mode is shown in fig 15a c f note that this fixed location is chosen in regions where the variance of the ssh is the highest we do not evaluate the cfb alone the regression of the ekman pumping calculated using absolute wind stress curl τ m in eq 2 is also shown in fig 15b d and i in contrast fig 15a shows that the relative wind stress curl perturbation is positive over the anticyclonic mesoscale oceanic eddies causing ascending motions and a cooling tendency of the potential temperature which inhibits the growth of the ssh above the anticyclonic mesoscale oceanic eddies the same is true for cyclonic mesoscale oceanic eddies therefore the relative wind stress curl and associated ekman pumping is a negative feedback on the ssh the response of the filtered ekman pumping for licom3 is much stronger than that for fgoals f3 h fig 15c f and the damping effect on the ssh is greater in general and this wind stress curl induced ekman pumping is of comparable magnitude with meso scale vertical velocity averaged over upper 25 m fig 15e j the negative feedback of the relative wind stress curl that damps the ssh variability can also be exemplified in the reversed directions between the relative wind stress τ and the ocean current fig 16 the negative correlation between the relative wind stress and the ocean current in licom3 is stronger than that in fgoals f3 h for the meridional fig 16b d and zonal fig 16a c components the correlation between the absolute wind stress τ m and the ocean current fig 16e h is not as strong as the correlation between the relative wind stress τ and the ocean current fig 16a d this result proves that the negative correlation between the filtered ocean current and the filtered wind stress is mainly caused by the ocean current velocity this result indicates that the net effect of the atmospheric feedback of the wind stress curl response to the tfb and cfb damps the tiws as a whole and is stronger inlicom3 in conclusion the mesoscale wind stress curl as a combined modulation of cfb and tfb in licom3 dampens the ssh variability more than fgoals f3 h the feedback on the ssh induced by the tfb wind stress curl responses is misrepresented as positive for fgoals f3 h but is absent for licom3 the negative feedback on the ssh resulting from the wind stress curl induced by tfb and cfb is stronger for licom3 than for fgoals f3 h additionally the icr in licom3 is also weaker than that in fgoals f3 h therefore the std of the ssh for licom3 is weaker than that for fgoals f3 h 6 summary and discussion in this study we first evaluate the environmental background of the tropical pacific and then focus on the differences in the spatial and temporal structures of pacific tiws from high resolution ocean only and coupled models as well as observations the differences in the spatial and temporal variabilities of pacific tiws between the high resolution coupled runs from fgoals and licom3 are investigated and the possible role of the mean state in changing the characteristics of tiws and the effect of air sea interaction feedbacks in causing the intensity difference in the ogcm and cgcm are explained the tiws referred to in this article are rossby mode only which is over periods of 25 to 40 days and between wavelengths of 950 and 3000 km the simulated mean states with regards to the sst wind stress curl and currents in the tropical pacific are compared with observations zonal wind stress in the equatorial region 0 180 90 w from licom3 and fgoals f3 h are 22 and 26 smaller than those for quikscat observations respectively the simulated thermocline is shallower due to the weaker easterly wind decreasing the vertical temperature gradient the meridional shear between the necc and sec n in the model simulations is weak due to the weaker necc especially in licom3 the maximum instability usually occurs around quadrupling of the rossby deformation radius which is mainly determined by the thermocline depth in this study because the buoyancy frequency is the same across model simulations and observations due to the shallower thermocline in the model simulations the deformation radii for licom3 and fgoals f3 h are 24 and 6 smaller than the value for soda meanwhile the growth rates of the instabilities for fgoals f3 h and licom3 are 17 and 30 smaller than that for soda respectively the systematic biases of the weak current shear and temperature stratification in the mean state also caused the simulated tiws to be weaker than the observations because of the weaker energy sources of the btr and bcr the eady model is simplified but is sufficient to reveal the relationship between the mean state of thermocline and tiws characteristics previous research investigated the propagation speed of the rossby wave under a warming climate and concluded the enhanced stratification in ocean can alter the wave speed and wavelength saenko 2006 both btr and bcr arising from the mean kinetic energy and available potential energy are stronger in fgoals f3 h than in licom3 but the sst variability is weaker for the fgoals f3 h than for the licom3 this indicates that the difference of sst and ssh variations between two model simulations cannot attributed to the different mean states only air sea interactions including tfb and cfb play an important role in modulating tiws firstly co located warm sst and accelerated wind speed perturbations responding to tfb reveal negative feedback on the sst through the loss of latent heat flux which causes more latent heat flux to be released from the ocean and thus suppresses the sst variability there because of the lack of tfb induced wind in licom3 the damping effect of latent heat flux sst is absent therefore the std of sst in licom3 is stronger than that for fgoals f3 h secondly the ssh variation can also be affected by the wind stress curl signature which is due to tfb and cfb chelton et al 2004 previous studies have emphasized that the cfb induced wind stress curl can cause curl induced ekman pumping of cold waters and decrease the ssh the tfb induced wind stress curl signature represented by τ m is a positive feedback for the ssh in fgoals f3 h due to a misrepresented precipitation response in comparison licom3 does not have this positive feedback as the ocean only simulation lacks the ability to represent the atmospheric response to the sst moreover the feedback of the wind stress curl combining the tfb and the cfb on the ssh represented by τ is negative and stronger for licom3 than for fgoals f3 h for licom3 this greatly dampens the ssh variation meanwhile the icr in licom3 is weaker than that in fgoals f3 h as a result the std of the ssh variations at 5 n in licom3 is 2 5 cm which is only half of the observed magnitude in summary this study may shed light on the numerical simulation of tiws in the future firstly the horizontal resolution must be fine enough to reproduce baroclinic instability processes which is a necessary condition for oceanic models to simulate tiws secondly given the fact that air sea interaction such as the tfb and cfb feedback plays an important role in tiws the numerical experiments with ocean only models such as omip simulation is not sufficient to fully describe fundamental dynamics of tiws thirdly because some basic features of tiws including intensity wavelength etc are highly dependent on the mean climatological state the tropical biases in the state of art coupled models may lead to serious biases in tiws as many studies have indicated there are obvious interactions between tiw and other dynamic processes with longer time scales for example wang et al 2022 diagnosed model output from fgolas f3 h the same coupled model as used in this study and they pointed out that tiws hinder enso growth through a lateral heat flux induced by horizontal and vertical eddy terms the enso amplitude becomes progressively smaller as the oceanic resolution becomes finer providing evidence for impacts from mesoscale and sub mesoscale eddies in simulated enso amplitude in this manuscript we mainly focused on the influence of mean state on tiw and we are going to do more analysis on the effect of eddy terms to enso and the mean state in other studies credit

local hydrology biochemistry and atmospheric boundary layer and feedback on ocean circulations and climate variability in this study the basic characteristics of pacific ocean tiws simulated by an eddy resolving ocean model and a coupled general circulation model are evaluated the simulated tiw biases mainly result from the mean climatology state as tiws extract eddy energy from the mean potential and kinetic energy both the oceanic and coupled models reproduce the observed westward propagating large scale rossby waves between approximately 2 8 n but the simulated tiws have shorter wavelengths than the observed waves due to the shallower thermocline meanwhile the weak meridional shears of background zonal currents and the less tilted pycnocline in these two models compared to the observations causes weak barotropic and baroclinic instability which decreases the intensity of the simulated tiws we then contrast the tiws from these two models and identify the roles of atmospheric feedback in modulating tiws the latent heat flux feedback is similar to observation in the coupled model but absent in the ocean model contributing to the stronger standard deviation std of the tiw sst in the ocean model the ocean model is not able to capture realistic air sea interaction processes when forced with prescribed atmospheric forcing however the misrepresented atmospheric feedback in the ocean model tends to decrease the sea surface height ssh variability and the current feedback damping effect is stronger in the ocean model than in the coupled model combined with weaker barotropic conversion rate and baroclinic conversion rate in the ocean model than in the coupled model the std of the tiw ssh in the ocean model is weaker keywords tropical instability waves

projects cmip6 1 introduction tropical instability waves tiws are westward propagating features in sea surface temperature sst sea surface height ssh surface wind stress and ocean color perturbations miller et al 1985 bryden and brady 1989 kennan and flament 2000 delpech et al 2021 with the wavelengths of 700 1600 km lyman et al 2007 tiws are also observed in current velocities and sea surface salinity lee et al 2012a b lyman et al 2007 the intensity of tiws shows a seasonal cycle and interannual variations because the background climatology such as meridional gradients of temperature and currents exhibits a seasonal cycle and interannual variations linked with the el niño southern oscillation enso in the tropical pacific tiws appear in june and are enhanced during the boreal fall and winter farrar 2008 additionally tiws are stronger in la niña years than in el niño years zhang and busalacchi 2008 an 2008 previous studies have revealed two modes of tiws with periods of 33 days and 17 days the 33 day tiws occurring near 5 n are often referred to as the rossby mode lyman et al 2007 tanaka and hibiya 2019 while the 17 day tiws on the equator are called the yanai mode liu et al 2019 the structures of rossby and yanai modes are characterized by the first baroclinic mode of rossby waves matsuno 1966 and mixed rossby gravity waves yanai and hayashi 1969 respectively the rossby yanai mode shows symmetric anti symmetric ssh across the equator wang et al 2020 the energy source of tiws mainly originates from barotropic instability which refers to the process by which perturbations draw eddy kinetic energy from the mean kinetic energy tiws can be generated by barotropic instabilities of the meridional shear between the northern part of the south equatorial current sec n and the north equatorial counter current necc in analytical observational and numerical studies seo et al 2007a flament et al 1996 cox 1980 tanaka and hibiya 2019 kessler et al 2003 im et al 2012 although some studies have revealed additional contributions from barotropic instabilities of the meridional shear between the sec n and the eastward flowing equatorial undercurrent euc luther and johnson 1990 qiao and weisberg 1998 tanaka and hibiya 2019 previous research has also clarified the role of the baroclinic instability arising from the meridional density contrast between the cold tongue and the off equatorial warmer waters which converts eddy potential energy epe to eddy kinetic energy eke masina and philander 1999 yu et al 1995 at seasonal or interannual time scales the intensity of tiws is closely related to the changing climate background through barotropic and baroclinic instability processes the horizontal resolution of models that can resolve tiw related baroclinic instability processes should be comparable with the first order rossby deformation radius or finer hallberg 2013 in particular multiscale interactions such as tiws and large scale circulation need to be investigated further based on numerical experiments with high resolution coupled models with the horizontal resolution of 1 3 or 1 4 for the ocean bryan et al 2010 mesoscale ocean atmosphere interactions are fundamentally different from large scale air sea interactions small et al 2008 the basin scale sst is negatively correlated with surface winds indicating that the atmosphere is the driver of the ocean in other words enhanced winds tend to cool the ocean surface through evaporation hashizume et al 2002 in contrast high pass filtered ssts and wind speeds are positively correlated indicating that the ocean is a driver of the atmosphere mainly through surface heat fluxes released from the ocean to the atmosphere mantua et al 1997 momentum mixing and pressure gradient mechanisms are two main hypotheses explaining how surface wind responds to mesoscale sst perturbations hayes et al 1989 proposed that the air column becomes unstable when it blows from cold water to a warm surface enhancing turbulent mixing and vertical momentum mixing lindzen and nigam 1987 proposed that hydrostatic atmosphere pressure gradients occur when forced with sst gradients both of these mechanisms can explain the accelerated decelerated winds over warm cold waters at the tiw scale small et al 2008 the properties of tiws can be modulated by both intrinsic instability processes in the ocean and air sea interactions because the surface wind stress is computed from the 10 m surface wind relative to the oceanic surface current ocean eddies influence surface stresses via ocean surface current and sst gradient induced wind variations small et al 2009 two types of air sea interactions were introduced in small et al 2008 and renault et al 2019 thermal feedback tfb and current feedback cfb tfb refers to the wind stress curl and latent heat flux response induced by the sst of tiws the cfb can be accounted for by using the wind relative to the oceanic current instead of the absolute wind ignoring surface motion cfb refers to the current modified wind stress signature which is equivalent to the difference of eq 1 minus eq 2 the wind stress curl modification caused by both tfb and cfb can modulate the off equatorial ssh for rossby tiws through ekman dynamics moreover small et al 2008 points out that it is very difficult to distinguish the wind stress curl modification caused by the sst of tiws from that caused by ocean currents renault et al 2019 carried out three simulations differed by the coupling effects they are resolving with or without the mesoscale tfb and the cfb we devise a way to isolate the tfb s effect the bulk formula for wind stress adopted in fgoals f3 h and licom3 is given in eq 1 and we recalculate a reference wind stress τ m based on eq 2 the relationship with this newly modified τ m and mesoscale sst or ssh can help to discuss the tfb separately 1 τ ρ 0 c d u a u c u a u c τ x τ y 2 τ m ρ 0 c d u a u a τ mx τ my where u a and u c denote the atmospheric wind at 10 m and the surface current respectively the air density near the sea surface ρ 0 equals 1 29 kg m 3 c d is the drag coefficient which is estimated from the so called bulk formula as a function of surface wind sea surface temperature and surface air temperature the mesoscale tfb results in wind speed perturbations that covary with the evolving sst perturbations posing negative feedbacks on the growth of sst perturbations by tiws mainly through latent heat flux loss seo et al 2007a the tfb induced wind stress can be accompanied by changes in wind derivatives wind stress curl divergence perturbations have been shown to be linearly dependent on the crosswind along wind component of the sst gradients for mesoscale air sea interactions chelton et al 2004 the existing research shows that this tfb can also generate wind stress curl perturbations that affect the spread of eddies in the coastal stream of california the location of the great whirl in the arabian sea and the latitude of the branch of the somali current seo et al 2016 seo 2017 in the eastern equatorial pacific the wind stress curl response to the tfb and its possible influence on the eddy magnitude have received little attention cfb is another part of the mesoscale air sea interaction because the surface wind stress is parameterized based on the relative velocity at the sea surface mesoscale oceanic eddies tend to dominate the variation in the wind stress curl anomalies in areas where ocean currents are relatively large for instance the cyclonic wind stress curl corresponds to anticyclone oceanic eddies note the minus sign in front of ocean current in 1 which can cause ekman pumping and the resultant cold water upwelling leads to a negative feedback to the original positive ssh small et al 2009 seo and xie 2011 seo et al 2006 these wind stress curls involving the wind speed relative to the ocean current suggest negative feedback on the mesoscale ssh through ekman dynamics cfb is also called top drag dewar and flierl 1987 and eddy killing renault et al 2016 because it can lead to kinetic energy losses of 30 for mesoscale eddies in high resolution models renault et al 2020 because tiws are not fully resolved in models with a resolution coarser than 100 km previous numerical studies on tiws have mainly been based on high resolution global or regional climate models bryan et al 2010 some biases appear in climate models when simulating the intensity of tiws and mesoscale interactions lin et al 2019 evaluated ocean mesoscale air sea interactions in a fully coupled high resolution model using licom2 liu et al 2012 with a resolution of 10 km and other components of the community earth system cesm version 1 0 they concluded that the responses of the wind stress to the eddy induced sst anomalies are weaker in the simulation than in the observations and that the latent heat flux response to mesoscale sst perturbations is overestimated in the simulation due to biases in the specific humidity the eddy kinetic energy inferred by mesoscale ssh variability increases in high resolution ocean model intercomparison project phase 2 omip 2 experiments griffies et al 2016 compared to their low resolution counterparts but is still weaker than observations chassignet et al 2020 ocean only simulations that adopt wind stress forcings calculated from wind relative to currents as in eq 1 such as ncar pop awi fesom and iap licom all show weaker eddy kinetic energy and ssh variabilities in contrast fsu hycom which adopts wind stress forcings calculated from only the 10 m atmospheric wind as in eq 2 shows weaker eddy kinetic energy and ssh variabilities than observations chassignet et al 2020 some ocean forcing datasets core jra55 do have winds adjusted toward satellite measurements which are already affected by ocean current therefore using this forcing and running the ocean model with currents in stress leads to a double counting of the current effect sun et al 2021 the purpose of the study is to evaluate the performance of fgoals f3 h in simulating tiws and to determine the role of air sea interactions in the light of differences in tiw simulations between licom3 and fgoals f3 h the effect of cfb and tfb on the tiw scale ssh and the latent heat flux response of tfb on the tiw scale sst are assessed additionally the wind stress curl response to tfb and its effect on the tiw scale ssh are analyzed to further understand the tiw scale ssh variation process section 2 describes the data and methodology used in this study section 3 presents a simple description of the large scale background circulation in the tropical pacific section 4 describes the differences in the intensity wavelength and spatial pattern of the tiws produced by the models and the observations and the role of the mean state in these differences section 5 explores the role of air sea interactions such as tfb and cfb in modulating the intensity of tiws through a comparison of simulations from licom3 and fgoals f3 h section 6 is a summary and discussion 2 data and methodology 2 1 data 2 1 1 satellite data and reanalysis the following datasets have been used as observational data 1 the 1 4 daily sst data from the noaa optimum interpolation sst oisst banzon et al 2014 reynolds et al 2007 which incorporates observations from different platforms 2 the 1 4 daily ssh from the archiving validation and interpretation of satellite oceanographic data aviso le traon et al 1998 3 the daily zonal and meridional wind at a height of 10 m and sea level pressure from era5 reanalysis hersbach et al 2020 the wind stress for era5 used in this study is the reference wind stress τ m calculated by eq 2 4 wind stress from quick scatterometer quikscat from remote sensing systems and sponsored by the nasa ocean vector winds science team xue wentz and smith 2005 the winds measured by a

atmosphere ocean array mcphaden et al 1998 at 0 n 125 w 5 n 125 w and 8 n 125 w in the pacific figure s1 therefore is proper to serve the comparison with the model results 2 1 2 model description flexible global ocean atmosphere land system finite volume version 3 fgoals f3 is a fully coupled model developed at the state key laboratory of numerical modeling for atmospheric sciences and geophysical fluid dynamics lasg institute of atmospheric physics iap chinese academy of sciences cas the four components ocean atmosphere land and ice for the high resolution version fgoals f3 h are given in detail in table 1 all tier 1 2 and 3 experiments of highresmip with fgoals f3 h are conducted and submitted to the cmip6 website and the tier 2 coupled ocean atmosphere simulations experiment which is referred to as fgoals f3 h is analyzed in this study these four components are coupled through the version 7 coupler in the community earth system model cesm craig et al 2011 the dynamic core for the atmospheric component of fgoals f3 h is a finite volume cubed sphere fv3 lin 2004 the oceanic component is the lasg iap climate system ocean model version 3 licom3 liu et al 2012 details of the orthogonal curvilinear coordinates and the tripolar grid used in licom3 can be found in yu et al 2018 the high resolution simulation of fgoals is built under the community earth system model framework an et al 2022 danabasoglu et al 2020 and the forcing fields are the same as those adopted in the cmip6 historical simulation eyring et al 2016 high frequency coupling is required for high resolution coupled runs the coupled time step is 15 min between the coupler and the atmosphere land and sea ice model components and 4 h between the coupler and the ocean model component licom3 adopts finite difference schemes to solve the primitive equations with boussinesq and hydrostatic approximations li et al 2020 the omip 2 simulation is carried out with a coupled ocean ice model in which the 1 10 degree licom3 is coupled with the community ice code version 4 cice4 hunke and lipscomb 2010 at the sea ice atmosphere interface the model is forced with freshwater heat and momentum fluxes the freshwater flux including precipitation and river runoff is from jra 55 kobayashi et al 2015 the turbulent fluxes at the surface are estimated from atmospheric state variables from jra 55 tsujino et al 2018 and sea surface temperature from ocean model the momentum fluxes are calculated using the relative velocity between the ocean and atmosphere as eq 1 which is hereafter referred to as the relative wind stress the u a comes from the atmospheric component of fgoals f3 h for the fgoals f3 h and the jra 55 reanalysis dataset for the licom3 in other words in the coupled model the relative wind effect can affect atmosphere wind via modifying the stress but in the omip experiment it cannot alter the wind to avoid vagueness we define τ m in eq 2 as the absolute wind stress which is used to isolate the effect of surface currents on the wind stress curl in section 5 to distinguish it from the relative wind stress τ in eq 1 all forcing variables are updated every 6 h the vertical mixing parameterization schemes adopted in fgoals f3 h and licom3 are the same the applied parameterization scheme can be found in li et al 2021 which includes the tidal mixing scheme st laurent et al 2002 the buoyancy frequency related thickness diffusivity scheme ferreira et al 2005 the vertical viscosity and diffusion scheme canuto et al 2001 and the chlorophyll a dependent solar penetration scheme lin et al 2007 the daily output variables in this study include the latent heat flux the meridional wind stress the zonal wind stress the wind stress curl at a height of 10 m the ocean potential temperature the sea surface height ocean currents sea level pressure and the near surface specific humidity at a height of 2 m analysis is done for the period 1999 to 2008 as all the datasets covered this period data are linearly interpolated to a 1 4 resolution for convenient comparison before analysis 2 2 identifying the rossby mode previous studies have demonstrated that observed tiws have symmetric ssh structures across the equator for the rossby mode and anti symmetric ssh structures for the yanai mode wang et al 2020 this trait can be used to separate these two modes the cross power spectral density c psd of the ssh at 2 n and 2 s is calculated by multiplying the fourier transform at 2 n and complex conjugate of fourier transform at 2 s and the time series must be normalized prior to analysis positive negative c psd values indicate that these two series have positive negative covariance values at the given frequency specifying the filter range for the rossby mode yanai mode hence the c psd of the ssh across the equator can give the specific frequency bands to distinguish the two tiw modes the tiw signals for the rossby mode are filtered over periods of 25 to 40 days and between wavelengths of 950 and 3000 km via 2d discrete fast fourier transform farrar 2008 and the results are denoted with a prime hereafter 2 3 joint empirical orthogonal function eof analysis the joint empirical orthogonal function eof is also called the multivariate eof meof method lee et al 2012 liang et al 2018 it has been widely used for investigating large scale atmospheric and coupled oceanic variability structures with this method the correlation patterns of two data matrices that are examples of different structures or state vectors and that share a common sampling dimension can be identified in practice two filtered variables are placed into one matrix such as the matrix shown below the eof is then performed on the covariance matrix with each variable normalized by the square root of its global mean variance first x a 11 a 12 a m 1 a m 2 a 1 n a mn b 11 b 12 b m 1 b m 1 b 1 n b mn where a stands for the ssh b represents the sst and a mn and b mn indicates that the ssh and sst locating at point m from time n respectively 2 4 definition of the tiw index we adopt the definition of the tiw index used in boucharel and jin 2019 to show the propagation of tiws according to their definition choosing different numbers and locations of points and moving them altogether in the zonal direction within the active region of tiws does not influence the result however the interval l between selected points is predefined based on the complex eof or other statistical methods xue et al 2021 l is the space between the adjacent sst anomaly ssta points which is equal to half of the tiw wavelength in degrees this tiw index has been proven to be effective in capturing the propagating tiw signals for the rossby mode xue et al 2021 based on joint eof analysis of the ssh and the sst fig 1 we estimate the wavelength from eof mode 1 and obtain values of 1225 km 11 980 km 8 8 and 817 km 7 2 for the observations fgoals f3 h and licom3 respectively therefore different spacing between the selected ssta points for licom3 fgoals f3 h and the observations are used because the tiws in these datasets have different wavelengths the ssta is calculated from the climatological daily mean from 1999 to 2008 in this study the sstas at eight points are summed from equally spaced points with weights with nodes at peaks and troughs of tiws so that the weights have alternating sign e g 1 for peaks and 1 for troughs the formula is shown below as eq 3 which is the same as eq 1 in boucharel and jin 2019 3 tiw t ssta t nodes 2 5 energy analysis when the temporal tendency is ignored the time mean eddy kinetic energy eke budget can be written as masina and philander 1999 seo et al 2007b 4 u eke u eke u p g ρ w ρ 0 u u u ρ 0 a h u 2 u ρ 0 u a v u z z τ z u surface where capital letters represent 60 day averages as running means and the bolded letters represent three dimensional vectors u u v w u is 60 day averaged u and prime indicates that the variable is filtered over the rossby mode range before analysis subscripted variables denote partial differentiation in the z axis directions x y z brackets indicate the annual mean w is the filtered ocean velocity components in the vertical direction τ is the filtered wind stress vector ρ is calculated from the potential temperature and salinity the constant ρ 0 equals 1025 kg m 3 a h and a v are the horizontal and vertical viscosities respectively g denotes acceleration due to gravity the left terms of eq 4 denote the advection of eke from the mean currents and the eddy current the first term on the right side is the vertical and horizontal radiation of energy and the second term represents the baroclinic conversion rate bcr the third term is the barotropic conversion rate btr with the dominant term being ρ 0 u v u y wang et al 2020 xue et al 2021 the btr refers to the kinetic energy conversion from the mean kinetic energy to the eke due to meridional shear between the sec n and necc and between the sec n and euc the bcr indicates the energy conversion from the epe to the eke cox 1980 masina and philander 1999 qiao and weisberg 1998 which depends on salinity temperature and pressure in the ocean the fourth and fifth terms indicate the horizontal and vertical dissipation respectively of eke by the eddies the last term denotes the mechanical energy input by the surface wind stress in the coupling process and acts as a kinetic energy sink source when the angle between the wind and the current is larger smaller than 90 the term on the left side and the first fourth and fifth terms on the right side are negligible in terms of their annual means seo et al 2007a wang et al 2017 illustrated that the peak values of the annual averaged bcr coincide with the sharpest meridional temperature gradient in the subsurface layer and the annual averaged btr values peaking at 2 n and 4 n correspond to the largest shear between the euc and the necc and the shear between the sec n and the necc respectively therefore we vertically integrate the remaining dominant term between the surface and h 150 m to quantitatively compare the mesoscale feedbacks and the rectified effects based on the difference in the large scale circulations the integration is done from the surface to 150 m and other depths of 50 m 180 m and 200 m are selected to assess the dependence of the results on the depth the fundamental pattern of btr and bcr are not sensitive to the depth the formula is shown below 5 btr h 1 h sfc ρ 0 u v u y dz 6 bcr h 1 h sfc g ρ w dz 7 couple h 1 h sfc τ z u surface dz positive negative btr or bcr values imply an increased decreased eke the btr and bcr can be combined into one term called the intrinsic energy conversion rate icr by the intrinsic instabilities which serve as an energy source for tiws the difference in the icr can be regarded as the rectified effect based on the difference in the large scale circulations the coupling term reflects the stress feedback damping term result from the interaction between the current modified stress by the tiws with the tiw surface current which serves as an energy sink for tiws because tiw induced winds are usually reversed to surface currents small et al 2009 3 large scale circulations in the tropical pacific the properties of tiws can be altered by both intrinsic ocean instability mechanisms and air sea interactions in the tropics the mean state of ocean currents and temperatures can influence eddy energy generation and is therefore of particular interest to our study meanwhile the biases in simulated currents are closely associated with biases in the ssh sst thermocline depth and wind stress for example sun et al 2019 states that the necc biases in the second phase of the coordinated ocean ice reference experiments core ii forced parallel ocean program version 2 and the coupled community earth system mode models cesm can be attributed to the adoption of relative wind stress forcings which is considered repeatedly in both the model flux formula and the reanalysis data with the latter having already been adjusted toward satellite data moreover because the sec and necc are in thermal wind balance with the thermocline trough along 4 n a greater temperature gradient in the meridional direction along the north and south slope of the thermocline accompanying the deeper thermocline is usually linked with a strong current and meridional current shear the systematic errors in the current wind stress and temperature are closely related with each other therefore comprehensively evaluating the ability of high resolution versions of ocean models and coupled gcms is necessary to simulate the large scale circulation in the tropical pacific the climatological field of the surface wind stress sea surface temperature sst and sea surface height ssh in the tropical pacific from observations licom3 and fgoals f3 h are given in fig 2 both fgoals f3 h and licom3 can reproduce the observed large scale patterns in the sst and ssh in the tropical pacific but with a weaker west east gradient fig 2 this west east contrast in the pacific is related to zonal winds and currents and is important for the mean state of the coupled system due to the underestimated trade winds and vertical mixing effects the thermocline is less steeply tilted and more diffuse in fgoals f3 h and licom3 the simulated mean state of the equatorial cold tongue in fgoals f3 h is slightly weaker and located farther eastward compared to the observations the root mean square error rmse for the sst field in licom3 and noaa oisst is 0 2 c and it is 0 9 c for fgoals f3 h but the meridional sst gradients from these two models are quite similar to observations figure s2 the zonal wind stress in the equatorial region 0 180 90 w from licom3 and fgoals f3 h is 22 and 26 smaller than the quikscat observations respectively the positive wind stress curl band between 2 n and 8 n is also weaker in the model simulations fig 3b c the observed positive wind stress curl band tends to induce strong upwelling and sharp temperature gradients in the vertical direction we diagnose the individual contributions from the surface wind stress to the zonal transport of necc following the equation ψ y deduced in sun et al 2019 2021 where ψ 1 β x y x c u r l τ d x ψ is the stream function of vertically integrate volume transport and the values of ψ along the coast of the americas are assigned to 0 fig 3 illustrates the zonal transport due to wind stress the upper 400 m vertically integrated zonal currents 0 400 m u dz is also given in fig 3 the figure shows that positive negative zonal sverdrup transport due to wind stress corresponds to a westward eastward current sun et al 2021 verifies that the correct simulation of the wind stress curl is the main factor in determining the simulation of the necc the westward transport in the necc region is weaker than that in the observations and it is the same for the vertically integrated volume transport fig 3 the necc currents along 120 w in licom3 and fgoals f3 h are 0 1 and 0 25 m s respectively which are both weaker than those from soda approximately 0 4 m s fig 4b c hence we conclude that the underestimation of necc transport in licom3 and fgoals f3 h can be attributed to weaker wind stress curl the thermocline is less steeply tilted between 5 n and 10 n and more diffuse in models compared with observations fig 4 and the thermocline is much more diffuse in fgoals f3 h than in licom3 the epe is converted from available potential energy ape and the ape of the mean state can be estimated from the north southward inclination of thermocline on vertical sections without considering the contributions from salinity fig 4 indicates that the simulated ape is weaker than observations if we also take salinity into account the pycnocline along 140 w figure s3 shows that the isopycnal surface is more flat in licom3 than in fgoals f3 h which is consistent with the conclusion drawn from vertical temperature sections fig 4 in general both licom3 and fgoals f3 h give realistic representations of the mean state of the tropical pacific climate regarding the horizontal structure of the sst and ssh but the weaker necc and the density stratification are likely to impact tiws intensity and it will be discussed in the next section 4 temporal and spatial evolution of tropical instability waves rossby mode and yanai mode can be separated based on c psd of ssh wang et al 2020 states that joint eof analysis between filtered ssh and sst values can separate the rossby and yanai modes the two leading eofs of licom3 and fgoals f3 h are two rossby modes with a 90 phase shift fig 1 however the 3rd and 4th modes of the eof decomposition for the models display features of both the rossby and yanai modes not shown indicating the two modes in models are not orthogonal also the yanai mode in the model simulations is weak and its spectra are notably different from the observed spectra fig 5 therefore we just discuss the filtered rossby mode signals only to ensure the authenticity of the results the intensity of tiws is gauged through the standard deviation std of the spatially and temporally filtered time series at each grid point from the ssh sst zonal current and meridional current data fig 6 specifically for the sst both models reproduce the correct latitudes of the maximum amplitudes at approximately 2 n but yield a weaker sst associated tiw amplitude the maximum std for the ssh due to the tiw variability in licom3 and fgoals f3 h is 1 6 cm and 2 6 cm both of which are less than that in the gridded satellite data product aviso 3 8 cm the surface current near the equator can be seen as quasi geostrophic balanced and as linearly dependent on the ssh holmes et al 2014 because the std of the ssh is smaller in the ocean only and coupled models the std of the ocean currents is also smaller fig 6h k the std of filtered surface current from oscar is shown in fig 6g j in which the std excessing 0 06 m s generally covers large areas than in licom3 but the figure for the observations is a little smaller in equatorial areas than that for fgoals f3 h this is probably because the observed zonal current estimated from the satellite ssh reveals large bias near the equator as the high frequency zonal and meridional currents in oscar are inaccurate johnson et al 2007 in conclusion both the ocean and coupled models underestimate the intensity of tiws with regard to the std of the ssh and sst previous studies have investigated the std of the mesoscale sst and ssh in models and possible reasons for their biases by comparing the results from a high resolution global environmental model higem1 2 and its low resolution version hadgem1 2 shaffrey et al 2009 attributed the low std of the ssh in hadgem1 2 to the unresolved baroclinic instability processes that generate the eddies the maximum variance in the sst in higem1 2 is further west and weaker than that in the observations due to the strength and location of the climatological mean temperature and velocity gradients roberts et al 2009 despite efforts to clarify the effect of increasing the resolution to enhance the mesoscale activity few studies have analyzed the comprehensive changes in the characteristics of tiws such as wavelength intensity time and spatial variations in relation to different mean climate states in eddy resolving experiments and the corresponding causes the climatological mean state can usually be improved as the ocean model s resolution increases bryan et al 2010 which contributes to the enhanced mesoscale activity a weaker necc will cause a weaker current shear in the meridional direction and decrease the generation of barotropic instabilities the bias in the thermocline depth indicates less ape for baroclinic instability conversions fig 4 as a result the weaker current shear and the diffuse thermocline in the model simulations see section 3 will lead to an insufficient energy supply and favor weakened tiws the intensity of tiws is also different from the observations in terms of the locations and spatial ranges of the maxima fig 6a and d clearly illustrate that the longitudinal coverage of the observed std values at 2 n over 0 18 c for the sst and 1 4 cm for the ssh is from 180 to 100 w in contrast it becomes narrower in the models only from 150 w to 110 w in addition to the tiws intensity the simulated wavelengths of tiws from licom3 and fgoals f3 h are 817 km 7 2 980 km 8 8 which is also shorter than 1225 km 11 for the observations fig 7b based on the joint eof analysis of the ssh and sst fig 1 fig 7 shows the regressions of the daily sst and ssh onto the standardized tiw index the definition of which can be found in section 2 the selected ssta points are denoted as asterisks and crossed circles for negative and positive weights respectively in fig 7 the propagation of tiws clearly exhibits regular westward propagating wavelike features the phase difference between the ssh and ssta along 0 10 n resembles that in the observations it is necessary to qualitatively understand why the tiw wavelengths in licom3 and fgoals f3 h are shorter and why the tiw intensity is weaker compared to the observations from the perspective of baroclinic instability dynamics the rossby mode structures are characterized by the first baroclinic mode of rossby waves matsuno 1966 and we calculate the typical stability properties of a specific configuration following eady s solution eady 1949 according to chapter 6 5 in vallis 2017 the characteristic spatial scales of the instability are characterized by the rossby deformation radius l d where l d nh f 0 h equals the thermocline depth f 0 is the coriolis parameter and n is the brunt väisala frequency where n g ρ ρ z g is the acceleration due to gravity and ρ ρ z equals the density gradient between the ocean surface and the thermocline the length scales of the maximum instability for the ocean are nearly four times the deformation radius l d the eady growth rate can be qualitatively calculated according to σ e 0 3 δ u l d where δ u is the vertical shear between the surface and the thermocline not surprisingly the rossby mode of the tiws in these two models has a shorter wavelength and a weaker intensity because as shown in fig 4 both fgoals f3 h and licom3 reveal an overall bias in reproducing the thermocline depth meridional sst gradient and current shear at 5 n the thermocline depths characterized by the 20 degree isotherm are approximately 100 m 120 m and 135 m in licom3 fgoals f3 h and the observations respectively fig 4 the shallow thermocline and associated vertical temperature gradient can cause a smaller deformation radius shorter wavelength and weaker ape the necc is weak due to the weak wind stress curl biases causing weak meridional shear of the zonal current that generates the btr even though the current shear is nonuniform the above figures estimated at 2 n 120 w and shown in table 2 still provide us with a quantitative understanding of the scale and growth rate of tiws the l d values are 372 9 km and 299 5 km for fgoals f3 h and licom3 respectively which are all shorter than the soda values 397 3 km the simulated buoyancy frequencies are almost identical in these two models and slightly smaller than the observations meanwhile the instability growth rate for the model simulations is significantly smaller than it is for the observations which is largely due to the smaller vertical shear the weak eady growth rate causes the weak tiw intensity the above analysis explains the discrepancy in the wavelength and intensity of tiws from the systematic errors of the climatology the underestimated tiws mainly result from the weak shear of the tropical current system and shallow thermocline which lead to decreased barotropic and baroclinic instabilities the bias of the shallow thermocline and weak vertical temperature gradient in the model simulations also leads to shorter wavelengths which are favorable to the growth of instabilities in addition to the intensity and wavelength differences mentioned above we applied a joint eof to the ssh and sst during 1999 2008 in the active tiw region 125 w 115 w 5 n 5 s to illustrate the spatial patterns of the tiw rossby mode because tiws are propagating waves eofs come in pairs to represent propagation and the first and second principal components pcs represent the rossby mode wang et al 2020 only the regression onto the first pc is shown because the regression patterns of the first two pcs are very similar we perform a lead lag 14 day cross regression between the variable and the first pc to obtain a larger picture of tiw propagation in the pacific fig 8 the observed rossby modes fig 8a induce northwest southeast nw se velocity ssh oscillations and northeast southwest ne sw sst oscillations which is consistent with other studies liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 the sst values peak at approximately 0 24 c at 2 n and the ssh peak is approximately 3 cm at 5 n the equatorial ocean surface current satisfies the quasi geostrophic balance so the surface current is almost parallel to the ssh contour lines clockwise oceanic eddies correspond to positive ssh values north of the equator and anticlockwise oceanic eddies correspond to positive ssh values south of the equator the spatial patterns of the rossby mode described above are realistically reproduced in model simulations fig 8b c the magnitudes of the regression coefficients represent the strengths of the oscillations related to the sst ssh and surface currents of the tiws the simulated intensities of the sst and ssh are all weaker than the observations which is consistent with fig 6 5 energetics of tiws and role of air sea interactions 5 1 energy budget analysis the numerical experiments with licom3 can be regarded as the oceanic responses to the surface forcing from the jra 55 dataset including the momentum and buoyancy fluxes without atmospheric feedback unlike fgoals f3 h which involves two way interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere the tiw induced tfb which relates to the heat flux and wind stress curl field is absent in licom3 this missing feedback may contribute to the distinct characteristics of the tiws in licom3 to a certain extent in addition to the contributions from the icr which are dependent on the large scale mean state hence a comparison from the energy analysis of the simulations from licom3 and fgoals f3 h should help reveal the influence of mesoscale feedback on the intensity of tiws and the influence of the climatological background btr and bcr observations are not available due to a lack of daily three dimensional and high resolution observation datasets for ocean currents therefore the focus of this subsection is on the sensitivity of tiw energetics in the models to background state we vertically integrate the btr bcr and couple as shown in eqs 5 7 for fgoals f3 h and licom3 the btr for fgoals f3 h is considerably higher than that for licom3 the bcrs from fgoals f3 h is bigger than from licom3 fig 9 shaffrey et al 2009 found that the meridional range of tiw related sst variability depends on the locations of meridional shear between the euc and sec n similarly both the simulated necc and sec n are weaker in the central pacific fig 4 where the meridional shear of zonal velocity is weaker as well specifically the meridional shear values at 2 n 120 w are 0 64 s 1 0 46 s 1 and 0 33 s 1 for soda fgoals f3 h and licom3 respectively leading to lower levels of barotropic instabilities and a smaller longitudinal coverage of sst in ocean model than coupled model and observation the bcr in licom3 are weaker than in fgoals f3 h because the small ape result from the bias in the mean state of the pycnocline depth figure s3 figure s4 shows that contribution from temperature to bcr figure s4c and s4d is more important than the contribution from salinity figure s4e and s4f in both licom3 and fgoals f3 h the stronger icr in fgoals f3 h than in licom3 can partly explain the stronger std of ssh but cannot illustrate the weaker std of sst in fgoals f3 h than in licom3 the coupling term is negative for both fgoals f3 h and licom3 with a considerably larger damping for fgoals f3 h this result indicates that currents cause a greater damping on wind stress in fgoals f3 h than in licom3 however the stronger energy sink in fgoals f3 h is probably for the sake of achieving balance with the stronger energy source due to the icr in the context of the long term climatological mean in summary we apply long term averaged eke analysis to assess the energy sources and sinks of tiws from a statistically balanced result between the mechanic production term icr and other dissipation terms fgoals f3 h exhibits a stronger icr than licom3 because of the discrepancies in the climate mean states thus the std of the ssh in fgoals f3 h is stronger than that in licom3 fig 6e f however the std of the sst in the former is slightly weaker than that in the latter fig 6b c this suggests the causes of the difference in the variances of the sst from these two models cannot be simply attributed to the differences in the icr as a result of the different mean states the coupling term which represents the effect of the correlation between currents and wind stresses is the dominant sink for the tiw eke in addition the air sea heat flux also affects the energy budget indirectly because the heat flux affects the sst and then the wind stress is affected by the sst therefore the role of tfb is analyzed below 5 2 heat flux and wind stress curl response to the tfb the focus of this part is the role of tfb and cfb in causing the difference in the intensity of tiws in licom3 and fgoals f3 h the icr and feedback of the relative wind stress curl response absolute wind stress curl response and the latent heat response to the tfb can only be qualitatively calculated and compared for high resolution datasets from fgoals f3 h and licom3 in this section we will investigate the role of air sea interactions in influencing the sst variability and the influence of mesoscale feedbacks on ssh variability the accelerated winds over warm waters associated with mesoscale perturbations lead to an increased latent heat flux and sensible heat flux which cause more heat to be lost through surface sensible and latent heat flux exchange thum et al 2002 describes the response of the magnitude and distribution of the sensible and latent heat fluxes across the sst front based on tao moorings both fluxes exert negative feedback on the tiw sst perturbations in this area latent heat flux perturbations are the primary contributor with typical magnitudes of 33 wm 2 c 1 of sst perturbations in comparison to the 4 wm 2 c 1 for the sensible heat flux thum et al 2002 small et al 2008 the pattern of latent heat flux induced by tfb wind stress is almost in phase with the sst perturbations the latent heat flux is proportional to the wind speed and air sea humidity difference with the product of the atmospheric density and exchange coefficient being the linear coefficient the meso scale air sea humidity difference contribute to most of the difference in the air sea heat flux feedback between the coupled and ocean only simulations figure s5 the tfb induced wind speed at 0 5 n also plays an important role in depressing the tiw related sst perturbations through the latent heat flux perturbations we regress the sst and filtered wind speed onto the sst at a fixed location 2 n 120 w for the 1999 2008 period fig 10 note that this fixed location is chosen in regions where the sst variance is the highest the coupling strength between the wind speed and the sst is strong in fgoals f3 h with a peak of 1 m s c at 120 w fig 10b higher than the figures for observations a positive correlation between the sst and the filtered wind speed perturbations exists for each grid point and the correlation coefficients exhibit a maximum of 0 9 at approximately 0 5 n not shown in fgoals f3 h however licom3 fails to reproduce these positive correlations correctly at the same locations as licom3 sst cannot affect wind air temperature and humidity the regression pattern of the filtered latent heat flux onto the filtered air sea humidity difference indicates that the latent heat flux induced negative feedback suppresses the sst in fgoals f3 h and the observations and this negative feedback is missing in licom3 fig 11a b the negative feedback is stronger in the eastern pacific for fgoals f3 h than for observations the above analysis explains why the std of the sst for fgoals f3 h is weaker than that for licom3 and also weaker than those observed fig 6b c the relative wind stress response can be accompanied by changes in the wind stress curl modifying the ssh of tiws through ekman dynamics the absolute wind stress curl response is separated from the whole mesoscale feedbacks and discussed first to understand why the std of the ssh in licom3 is weaker than that in fgoals f3 h recall the spatial patterns of the ssh sst ocean current and wind stress field for the rossby mode fig 8a the rossby mode has a preferred oscillation direction characterized by northwest southeastward nw se velocity and ssh oscillations and northeast southwestward ne sw sst oscillations between 0 10 n fig 8a specifically the warm sst is surrounded by anticyclonic oceanic eddies on the left and cyclonic oceanic eddies on the right the accelerated wind speed over the warm sea surface will affect the negative ssh via the wind stress curl the pattern of the induced wind stress curl patterns resulting from tfb solely in the pacific has never been clearly illustrated before and is discussed in this section to separate the onefold influence of the tfb induced wind stress curl on ekman pumping a 10 m atmospheric wind field is used to calculate a new absolute wind stress as shown in eq 2 which is denoted as τ m the regression of τ m to the single point sst at 2 n 120 w can be seen as the wind stress curl in response to the sst alone fig 12 the tfb is given by fig 12b d f and the cfb is given by fig 12a minus 12b 12c minus 12d 12e minus 12f fig 12d shows that the positive sst at 2 n results in the cyclonic wind stress curl and causes ekman pumping for fgoals f3 h the upwelling leads to cold subsurface temperature perturbations resulting in a negative ssh at approximately 5 n fig 13b in other words for fgoals f3 h the wind stress curl response to the sst at 2 n acts as a positive feedback to the ssh at approximately 5 n however because surface wind fields are external forcings from the jra 55 dataset without any relationship with the sst in the licom3 simulations no such positive feedback exists for the ssh fig 12f however the absolute wind stress curl calculated from the era5 seems to have no impact on the ssh at 5 n fig 12b to understand the relationship between the ssh and the wind stress curl perturbations the regression coefficients between the ssh and sea level pressure perturbations slp and the precipitation pr are shown in figs 13 and 14 because the rotational wind field directly arises from the sst patterns through the momentum mixing and or pressure gradient mechanism a positive pr and a negative slp is linked with a cyclonic wind field at the sea surface the regression of pr and slp onto the single point sst at 2 n 120 w supports that the wind stress response to the tfb is a positive feedback on the ssh for fgoals f3 h for the observations the positive and negative centers of the pr oscillations are located at the zero line of the ssh which means that mesoscale sst poses a negligible impact on the ssh via wind stress this analysis is consistent with previous regressions on the filtered absolute wind stress curl fig 12b even though the phase difference between the precipitation response for fgoals f3 h and the observations is approximately 2 the pattern is totally changed the pattern of the precipitation response is misrepresented for fgoals f3 h with negative pr and positive slp values overlapping positive ssh values figs 13b 14b and forming anti cyclonic circulation to strengthen the positive ssh because near the equator f 0 and ocean flow is accelerated in the direction of the wind stress in contrast this misrepresented positive feedback toward the ssh in fgoals f3 h is absent in licom3 because sst variations do not feedback to the atmosphere and induce wind variations moreover the intensity of the precipitation response for fgoals f3 h is stronger than that for the observations which means stronger anti cyclonic circulation above the positive ssh this phenomenon increases the ssh variability in fgoals f3 h bao and li 2020 indicated that the high resolution amip run of fgoals f3 has a larger positive bias in precipitation than the low resolution run which may be due to a lack of specific tuning of the sub grid parameterization schemes for the high resolution agcm this precipitation bias still exists in fgoals f3 h as illustrated in the introduction the wind stress curl response to cfb also influences the mesoscale ssh variability and the bias attribution of the weaker std of the ssh for licom3 than for fgoals f3 h is finally made after the evaluation of mesoscale feedback on ssh in account of both the tfb and the cfb in section 5 3 5 3 wind stress curl response considering the cfb for the wind stress curl signature considering the modification of the ocean current and sst the regression of the ekman pumping calculated using relative wind stress curl τ in eq 1 onto the single point ssh at 5 n 120 w for the rossby mode is shown in fig 15a c f note that this fixed location is chosen in regions where the variance of the ssh is the highest we do not evaluate the cfb alone the regression of the ekman pumping calculated using absolute wind stress curl τ m in eq 2 is also shown in fig 15b d and i in contrast fig 15a shows that the relative wind stress curl perturbation is positive over the anticyclonic mesoscale oceanic eddies causing ascending motions and a cooling tendency of the potential temperature which inhibits the growth of the ssh above the anticyclonic mesoscale oceanic eddies the same is true for cyclonic mesoscale oceanic eddies therefore the relative wind stress curl and associated ekman pumping is a negative feedback on the ssh the response of the filtered ekman pumping for licom3 is much stronger than that for fgoals f3 h fig 15c f and the damping effect on the ssh is greater in general and this wind stress curl induced ekman pumping is of comparable magnitude with meso scale vertical velocity averaged over upper 25 m fig 15e j the negative feedback of the relative wind stress curl that damps the ssh variability can also be exemplified in the reversed directions between the relative wind stress τ and the ocean current fig 16 the negative correlation between the relative wind stress and the ocean current in licom3 is stronger than that in fgoals f3 h for the meridional fig 16b d and zonal fig 16a c components the correlation between the absolute wind stress τ m and the ocean current fig 16e h is not as strong as the correlation between the relative wind stress τ and the ocean current fig 16a d this result proves that the negative correlation between the filtered ocean current and the filtered wind stress is mainly caused by the ocean current velocity this result indicates that the net effect of the atmospheric feedback of the wind stress curl response to the tfb and cfb damps the tiws as a whole and is stronger inlicom3 in conclusion the mesoscale wind stress curl as a combined modulation of cfb and tfb in licom3 dampens the ssh variability more than fgoals f3 h the feedback on the ssh induced by the tfb wind stress curl responses is misrepresented as positive for fgoals f3 h but is absent for licom3 the negative feedback on the ssh resulting from the wind stress curl induced by tfb and cfb is stronger for licom3 than for fgoals f3 h additionally the icr in licom3 is also weaker than that in fgoals f3 h therefore the std of the ssh for licom3 is weaker than that for fgoals f3 h 6 summary and discussion in this study we first evaluate the environmental background of the tropical pacific and then focus on the differences in the spatial and temporal structures of pacific tiws from high resolution ocean only and coupled models as well as observations the differences in the spatial and temporal variabilities of pacific tiws between the high resolution coupled runs from fgoals and licom3 are investigated and the possible role of the mean state in changing the characteristics of tiws and the effect of air sea interaction feedbacks in causing the intensity difference in the ogcm and cgcm are explained the tiws referred to in this article are rossby mode only which is over periods of 25 to 40 days and between wavelengths of 950 and 3000 km the simulated mean states with regards to the sst wind stress curl and currents in the tropical pacific are compared with observations zonal wind stress in the equatorial region 0 180 90 w from licom3 and fgoals f3 h are 22 and 26 smaller than those for quikscat observations respectively the simulated thermocline is shallower due to the weaker easterly wind decreasing the vertical temperature gradient the meridional shear between the necc and sec n in the model simulations is weak due to the weaker necc especially in licom3 the maximum instability usually occurs around quadrupling of the rossby deformation radius which is mainly determined by the thermocline depth in this study because the buoyancy frequency is the same across model simulations and observations due to the shallower thermocline in the model simulations the deformation radii for licom3 and fgoals f3 h are 24 and 6 smaller than the value for soda meanwhile the growth rates of the instabilities for fgoals f3 h and licom3 are 17 and 30 smaller than that for soda respectively the systematic biases of the weak current shear and temperature stratification in the mean state also caused the simulated tiws to be weaker than the observations because of the weaker energy sources of the btr and bcr the eady model is simplified but is sufficient to reveal the relationship between the mean state of thermocline and tiws characteristics previous research investigated the propagation speed of the rossby wave under a warming climate and concluded the enhanced stratification in ocean can alter the wave speed and wavelength saenko 2006 both btr and bcr arising from the mean kinetic energy and available potential energy are stronger in fgoals f3 h than in licom3 but the sst variability is weaker for the fgoals f3 h than for the licom3 this indicates that the difference of sst and ssh variations between two model simulations cannot attributed to the different mean states only air sea interactions including tfb and cfb play an important role in modulating tiws firstly co located warm sst and accelerated wind speed perturbations responding to tfb reveal negative feedback on the sst through the loss of latent heat flux which causes more latent heat flux to be released from the ocean and thus suppresses the sst variability there because of the lack of tfb induced wind in licom3 the damping effect of latent heat flux sst is absent therefore the std of sst in licom3 is stronger than that for fgoals f3 h secondly the ssh variation can also be affected by the wind stress curl signature which is due to tfb and cfb chelton et al 2004 previous studies have emphasized that the cfb induced wind stress curl can cause curl induced ekman pumping of cold waters and decrease the ssh the tfb induced wind stress curl signature represented by τ m is a positive feedback for the ssh in fgoals f3 h due to a misrepresented precipitation response in comparison licom3 does not have this positive feedback as the ocean only simulation lacks the ability to represent the atmospheric response to the sst moreover the feedback of the wind stress curl combining the tfb and the cfb on the ssh represented by τ is negative and stronger for licom3 than for fgoals f3 h for licom3 this greatly dampens the ssh variation meanwhile the icr in licom3 is weaker than that in fgoals f3 h as a result the std of the ssh variations at 5 n in licom3 is 2 5 cm which is only half of the observed magnitude in summary this study may shed light on the numerical simulation of tiws in the future firstly the horizontal resolution must be fine enough to reproduce baroclinic instability processes which is a necessary condition for oceanic models to simulate tiws secondly given the fact that air sea interaction such as the tfb and cfb feedback plays an important role in tiws the numerical experiments with ocean only models such as omip simulation is not sufficient to fully describe fundamental dynamics of tiws thirdly because some basic features of tiws including intensity wavelength etc are highly dependent on the mean climatological state the tropical biases in the state of art coupled models may lead to serious biases in tiws as many studies have indicated there are obvious interactions between tiw and other dynamic processes with longer time scales for example wang et al 2022 diagnosed model output from fgolas f3 h the same coupled model as used in this study and they pointed out that tiws hinder enso growth through a lateral heat flux induced by horizontal and vertical eddy terms the enso amplitude becomes progressively smaller as the oceanic resolution becomes finer providing evidence for impacts from mesoscale and sub mesoscale eddies in simulated enso amplitude in this manuscript we mainly focused on the influence of mean state on tiw and we are going to do more analysis on the effect of eddy terms to enso and the mean state in other studies credit

23786,small scale eddies play an important role in preconditioning and restratifying the water column before and after mixing events thereby affecting deep water formation variability results from a realistic eddy resolving 5 km local horizontal resolution ocean model suggest that small scale temperature fluxes due to turbulent potential to kinetic energy conversion are the main driver of mixed layer restratification during deep convection in the labrador sea interior and the west greenland current this resupply of heat due to turbulent upward buoyancy fluxes exhibits a large interannual variability imposed by the atmospheric forcing eddy fluxes only become active in periods of strong buoyancy loss while being quiescent otherwise in a low resolution 20 km control simulation the modeled turbulence is strongly reduced and the associated modeled and parameterized heat fluxes are too weak to increase stratification keywords high resolution labrador sea mixed layer depth turbulence eddy kinetic energy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction mesoscale eddies are ubiquitous in the world ocean chelton et al 2011 on length scales of the local baroclinic rossby radius of deformation these vortices yield mesoscale temperature and freshwater fluxes which modify sea water properties and thus change the ocean circulation biogeochemical fluxes and mixed layer properties zhang et al 2014 fröb et al 2016 gaube et al 2019 the labrador sea ls is a region of frequent deep convection during winter and thereby an important place of deep water formation that contributes to overturning circulation and its variability rhein et al 2017 yeager et al 2021 here eddies were observed to contribute to preconditioning before and restratification after deep convection as well as to enable the exchange of water masses between the interior and the boundary current marshall and schott 1999 lilly et al 2003 straneo 2006 palter et al 2008 de jong et al 2014 rykova et al 2015 yashayaev and loder 2016 zhang and yan 2018 zou et al 2021 pacini and pickart 2022 however the transfer of turbulent energy and associated mesoscale tracer fluxes remains unclear due to sparsity of available observations numerical model experiments suggest a complex interplay of barotropic and baroclinic instabilities as the source of eddy kinetic energy

addition convective eddies in the vicinity of the deep convection patch as well as boundary current eddies work to flatten steep isopycnals chanut et al 2008 mcgeehan and maslowski 2011 kawasaki and

to be on average as important as the mean circulation in the ls however no clear picture was provided whether eddies act to reinforce or work against the mean circulation chanut et al 2008 kawasaki and hasumi 2014 saenko et al 2014 de jong et al 2016 tagklis et al 2020 due to the small local rossby radius of deformation of 10 km and the complex geometry of the ls numerical experiments with realistic high resolution ocean models require high computational costs thus the conducted model simulations in these previous studies usually cover a short period in time and focus on the mean state or the mean annual cycle in this study we use the global ocean model fesom danilov et al 2004 wang et al 2014 with a locally mesoscale resolving horizontal resolution of 5 km and provide a coherent picture of turbulent kinetic energy and associated mesoscale temperature fluxes we integrated the model for 310 years to examine a decadal time scale perspective of the complex ls mixed layer restratification dynamics in addition a low resolution 20 km local horizontal resolution setup serves as control run to investigate the influence of the model resolution this study hence aims to shed light on the temporal variability of mesoscale turbulence in the ls as this was not provided earlier with a realistic high resolution ocean model 2 methods 2 1 ocean model fesom the global finite

restratification low and high resolution fesom grids were designed fig 1 based on a global average horizontal resolution of 130 40 km the element size was reduced to 40 20 km along the coasts and the equator in the low high resolution setup to improve the modeling of upwelling upon this the resolution was further increased in the subpolar gyre the arctic ocean deep convection areas and along the greenland coast the low resolution grid 39 vertical levels was utilized in earlier fesom experiments and showed good agreement with the ls deep water variability compared to observations albeit

sea ls is losing heat to the atmosphere through outgoing longwave radiation and sensible and latent heat fluxes f 0 shading in fig 3a b this heat loss is partly compensated by the boundary current the depth integrated horizontal mean temperature flux convergence exhibits large values along the west greenland current wgc black arrows in fig 3c d in the high resolution run 5 km local horizontal resolution heat is mainly provided by the wgc in a narrow band between the 2 and 3 km isobaths while being removed on and off shore of this patch this spatial tripole was also seen in earlier studies kawasaki and hasumi 2014 tagklis et al 2020 the heat supply continues along the 3 km isobath further downstream a second route of large heat supply establishes at 62 5 that continues along the 2 km isobath throughout the ls in accordance with de jong et al 2016 tagklis et al 2020 the structure of the low resolution 20 km local horizontal resolution boundary current is broader and more homogeneous as in the high resolution setup and provides heat in a large patch between the 2 and 3 km isobaths fig 3c heat is lost on the onshore side of this temperature convergence yielding a large scale dipole pattern in contrast to the numerous convergence divergence patches of the high resolution mean temperature fluxes along the boundary current in the ls interior the mean temperature advection convergence is 1 magnitude smaller compared to the boundary current region in both model setups here divergent and convergent patches coexist next to each other this feature is much more heterogeneous in the high resolution model with a large number of divergent and convergent patches on spatial scales of tens to a few hundreds of km the low resolution ls interior is gaining losing heat in the northeast southwest due to the average circulation the depth integrated temperature flux fluctuations on temporal scales from the model time step to a month i e eddy component see methods follow the main circulation around the ls similarly as the mean component but is 1 magnitude smaller fig 3e f this in contrast to earlier studies chanut et al 2008 saenko et al 2014 kawasaki and hasumi 2014 de jong et al 2016 tagklis et al 2020 and will be discussed later as a consequence the total advection mean eddy fig 4 resembles the mean component the heat supply and removal by the mean circulation is generally enforced by the eddy fluxes in the high resolution setup same sign this is not the case in the northern part of the ls interior as well as further downstream along the 3 km isobath where mean and eddy fluxes mostly compensate in agreement with these studies the low resolution eddy fluxes occur in broader spatial patterns compared to the high resolution setup regions of compensating e g between 1 and 2 km isobaths partly between 2 and 3 km isobaths and enforcing e g ls interior mean and eddy fluxes exist similarly as in the high resolution run the following temporal

no temporal variability and remains at deep depths fig 5a averaging area outlined by dashed black line fig 3a b in addition the average march low resolution mld spans a much larger area compared to the high resolution setup and observations en4 good et al 2013 other mld thresholds do not change these general differences between the model setups and observations not shown a similar picture emerges for the horizontal eddy temperature advection convergence volume integrated from the surface to the respective mlds within the ls interior index area shown by dashed black line in fig 3a b while the large scale circulation leads to heat loss in the convection zone high resolution eddy fluxes temporarily become active and reduce or even balance this heat loss during deep convection events red line in fig 5c these dynamics are almost absent in the low resolution model where the eddy contribution is much weaker and hardly balances the heat loss due to the mean circulation fig 5b here subgrid scale sgs fluxes are strongly enhanced compared to the negligible values of the high resolution model dashed red lines in fig 5b c however the total temperature advection convergence including the sgs contribution remains negative in the low resolution mixed layer integration over the whole water column suggests an important stabilizing contribution of the mean circulation below the mixed layer fig 6 here mean and eddy temperature advection components compensate the heat loss from the atmospheric forcing yielding a dynamical equilibrium in the high resolution run close agreement between left and right hand sides of eq 1 orange and gray lines in fig 6 bottom this equilibrium is not obtained in the low resolution run where the eddy contribution is too weak and the mean circulation does not work against the forcing fig 6 top the resulting imbalance needs to be closed by horizontal and vertical diffusion including the lon local transport term from the kpp parameterization as well as the vertical component of advection and the parameterized sgs flux dashed black lines in fig 6 3 2 eke generation in the labrador sea the spatial structure of the annual average surface eddy kinetic energy eke follows the wgc and its separation from the coast as shown by the blue isolines of the individual means plus two standard deviations in fig 3a b their numerical values are 124 and 257 cm 2 s 2 for the low and high resolution model runs solid blue lines and 39 cm 2 s 2 for satellite altimetry 1993 to 2009 dashed blue line eke values are twice as large and reach far more into the ls interior in the high compared to the low resolution run the observed spatial eke structure is more similar to the high resolution setup in addition enhanced eke values are found south of the 3 km isobath which is not the case in both model runs absolute values of eke derived from altimetry are much lower than the modeled eke due to the inference from geostrophic currents excluding the ageostrophic component based on daily snapshots excluding variability on shorter time scales on relatively coarse 0 25 horizontal resolution rieck et al 2019 the spatial structure of the modeled depth integrated eke similarly follows the wgc and its separation from the coast as shown by the solid and dashed blue isolines in fig 7a b 5 and 20 m 3 s 2 the 5 m 3 s 2 eke patch is much larger in the high compared to the low resolution model run higher values such as 20 m 3 s 2 are not reached by the latter on average the depth integrated eke peaks in march fig 9e hence eke generating processes will be analyzed for this month in march eke is generated through turbulent wind work f e k e 0 at the sea surface with larger values in the eastern part of the ls fig 7a b the rather homogeneous spatial pattern of eke generation through f e k e reflects that on average the wind stress and surface current anomalies point into the same direction in line with previous studies von storch et al 2007 von storch et al 2012 rimac et al 2016 the depth integrated barotropic hrs leads to eddy growth at the expense of the mean flow on the offshore side of the wgc before and after separation from the greenland coast fig 7c d in a narrow patch between the 1 and 2 km isobaths along the coasts of greenland and canada eddies transfer energy back the mean flow by horizontal shear hrs 0 the high resolution run exhibits much larger values of this barotropic instability compared to the low resolution setup these large hrs values drop by 2 magnitudes towards the ls interior depth integrated baroclinic instability p e k e is responsible for an eke increase almost everywhere in the ls fig 7e f its general pattern resembles the barotropic one with enhanced values along the wgc and the downstream circulation as expected the region of large depth integrated hrs and p e k e corresponds with the depth integrated eke blue isolines in fig 7a b wind forcing is a constant source of eke solid lines and left axis in fig 8a with decadal fluctuations smaller than the average seasonal cycle fig 9a area integrated over the ls interior both model setups exhibit similar f e k e values with small differences probably arising from faster surface currents in the high resolution run volume integrated barotropic and baroclinic eke conversion terms in contrast differ greatly between low and high resolution runs solid lines and left axes in fig 8b c during deep convection events in the early 1970s mid 1980s and early to mid 1990s high resolution barotropic and baroclinic instabilities are strongly enhanced in the ls interior negative hrs and vrs lead to a removal of eke in the ls interior note the smaller order of magnitude for vrs dashed lines and right axis in fig 8b however eddy growth in the ls interior due to baroclinic instabilities p e k e is one magnitude larger than the combined barotropic instabilities k m k e this is also the case in the area of the wgc and its separation from the coast fig 10 hence the evolution of the volume integrated eke closely follows p e k e dashed lines and right axis in fig 8c similar proportions apply to the low resolution run although much reduced in absolute numbers and to the average seasonal cycle fig 9b e eke is removed mainly by dissipation through vertical momentum diffusion and by a much smaller amount bottom drag fig 11 the eke contribution to the total kinetic energy u h 2 2 does not show pronounced peaks during deep water formation events but rather stays around 25 in the low and around 45 in the high resolution run dashed lines and right axis in fig 8a their decadal fluctuations are of similar magnitude as the average seasonal cycle fig 9f 4 discussion the labrador sea as modeled with fesom exhibits a vivid eke field with a pronounced decadal variability at a local horizontal resolution of 5 km this turbulence is strong enough to induce small scale temperature fluxes that lead to an efficient mld restratification fig 5 at a slightly decreased local resolution of 20 km these fluxes are too weak to increase stability parameterized sgs fluxes taken into account and the resulting mld is too deep and its extent too large a common problem of state of the art ocean and climate models danabasoglu et al 2014 heuzé 2021 koenigk et al 2021 in the ls interior the modeled turbulence is mostly of baroclinic origin induced through upward eddy buoyancy fluxes fig 8 our results thus support the view that meso to submesoscale baroclinic instabilities are essential for restratifying the water column after convection baroclinic instability induced through large ageostrophic velocities lavender et al 2002 transport heat upwards morrison et al 2013 saenko 2015 that draws turbulent potential energy from steep isopycnals which thereby flatten fox kemper et al 2008 the large interannual variability of this upward eddy buoyancy flux dominates the temporal evolution of the volume integrated eke fig 8c indicative of important subsurface eke generation hu et al 2020 hence reported non significant surface eke trends of the highly baroclinic and eddy rich gulf stream and kuroshio current derived from satellite altimetry may be underestimated martínez moreno et al 2021 in the area of the wgc and its separation from the coast barotropic instability mainly horizontal shear additionally becomes important for eddy growth eden and böning 2002 but turbulent buoyancy fluxes remain the dominant eke source fig 10 in line with previous studies saenko et al 2014 pacini and pickart 2022 observations indicate that eddies generated within and advected with the boundary current transport heat and salt or freshwater into the ls interior irminger rings jones and marshall 1997 lilly et al 2003 straneo 2006 schmidt and send 2007 rykova et al 2009 de jong et al 2014 rykova et al 2015 this implies that the seawater properties of the boundary current set the restratification ability of the eddies we can confirm this since the efficient mld restratification seen in our high resolution setup was only achieved when the boundary current was not biased too dense and thus being able to provide buoyant water masses i e after some forcing cycles danek et al 2019 hence if no buoyant water is available in the interior or the boundary current upward turbulent buoyancy fluxes as well as eddies from the wbc may not contribute to restratification thomas and zhang 2022 this view is supported by observations luo et al 2012 pacini and pickart 2022 and model results where a suppressed turbulence in the wgc led to an underestimation of transports of heat into the ls interior by irminger rings and a deeper mld gelderloos et al 2011 kawasaki and hasumi 2014 rieck et al 2019 pennelly and myers 2022 previous studies using realistic high resolution ocean models found that on the long term average mean and eddy temperature flux convergence are of equal importance in the ls chanut et al 2008 saenko et al 2014 kawasaki and hasumi 2014 de jong et al 2016 tagklis et al 2020 common to some of these studies is an eddy definition that incorporates deviations from a relatively long period e g 5 chanut et al 2008 saenko et al 2014 7 tagklis et al 2020 or 14 years de jong et al 2016 our eddy component in contrast represents fluctuations on much shorter time scales from the model time step to a month von storch et al 2012 we thereby provide another perspective on the mean eddy interplay on the long term average 1948 2009 the eddy temperature fluxes are much weaker than the mean component also in the high resolution setup whereby the total advection resembles the mean component compare figs 3c d and 4 triggered by strong forcing however the eddy component greatly increases playing a role equally important as the mean circulation as long as the spatial resolution is high enough which is in accordance with the cited studies above figs 5b c and 6 hence together with the notion that a longer averaging period leads to larger deviations from that average rieck et al 2015 this physically consistent picture was not documented earlier due to the missing decadal temporal perspective in kawasaki and hasumi 2014 however the temporal average of mean and eddy heat flux components are of similar magnitude although the same eddy definition as in this study was used in contrast to our 62 years of 6 h atmospheric forcing they utilized a daily climatology representing the years 1979 to 1993 to force their ocean model this time period is biased towards a positive nao phase and thus enhanced heat loss in the ls röske 2006 for this period our high resolution run indeed shows a similar importance of mean and eddy components of heat fluxes integrated over the mixed layer fig 5b c and the whole water column fig 6 hence it may be that the heat flux composition presented by kawasaki and hasumi 2014 rather represent a positive nao state and not a general temporal average the complex spatial structure of the high resolution heat flux convergence due to the construction via the divergence operator is difficult to interpret and may require more averaging than applied in this study for example spatial smoothing was used to obtain a more coherent picture chanut et al 2008 saenko et al 2014 on the other hand small scale features may get lost due to smoothing as for example the heat loss patch on the onshore side of the wgc due to the mean circulation kawasaki and hasumi 2014 tagklis et al 2020 this study another example is the interplay between mean and eddy temperature fluxes in the wgc which were shown to generally work against each other opposite sign chanut et al 2008 saenko et al 2014 kawasaki and hasumi 2014 de jong et al 2016 our high resolution eddy temperature fluxes in contrast tend to enforce the mean wgc same sign this is also seen in tagklis et al 2020 where a higher model resolution seems to yield a larger agreement of the signs of mean and eddy flux components over large parts of the wgc within the 2 and 3 km isobaths hence a general relationship between the type of instability and effects of the resulting eddy fluxes i e to enforce or oppose mean fluxes remains unclear albeit the relatively high spatial resolution the eddy temperature fluxes are not strong enough to efficiently limit the spatial extent of the mld in the high resolution setup especially to the northeast of the deep ls interior where the mld patch is too large compared to observations irrespective of mld threshold recent model results suggest that too many vertical model levels 61 in our high resolution setup and a thereby too smooth slope geometry reduces turbulence and hence small scale tracer fluxes gillard et al 2022 our low resolution model reveals further challenges first the usually utilized sgs parameterization gent and mcwilliams 1990 of eddy fluxes is too weak to mimic meaningful effects of turbulence second in the ls interior where complicated ocean dynamics and steep topography work in concert large diapycnal buoyancy fluxes from the vertical mixing scheme and dissipation seem necessary to obtain a dynamical equilibrium rest term in fig 6 this points to the importance of mixing and non linearities in the ls interior morrison et al 2013 griffies et al 2015 corre et al 2020 but is beyond the scope of this study 5 concluding remarks to conclude eddy fluxes on spatio temporal scales of a few km from the model time step to a month significantly contribute to tracer advection and facilitate mixed layer restratification in the ls after deep convection events these eddy fluxes are mainly of baroclinic origin and their interannual variability is coupled to the atmospheric forcing i e turbulence is strongly enhanced during periods of large oceanic heat loss and quiescent otherwise buoyant water from the boundary current needs to be available to increase stratification in the ls interior a higher spatial model resolution clearly improves the spatial temporal structure of the ls deep convection in addition future work should concentrate on the systematic improvement of eddy and mixing parameterizations used in climate models especially in challenging regions like the labrador sea moreover methodological definitions of e g spatio temporal flux decomposition and smoothing techniques

23786,small scale eddies play an important role in preconditioning and restratifying the water column before and after mixing events thereby affecting deep water formation variability results from a realistic eddy resolving 5 km local horizontal resolution ocean model suggest that small scale temperature fluxes due to turbulent potential to kinetic energy conversion are the main driver of mixed layer restratification during deep convection in the labrador sea interior and the west greenland current this resupply of heat due to turbulent upward buoyancy fluxes exhibits a large interannual variability imposed by the atmospheric forcing eddy fluxes only become active in periods of strong buoyancy loss while being quiescent otherwise in a low resolution 20 km control simulation the modeled turbulence is strongly reduced and the associated modeled and parameterized heat fluxes are too weak to increase stratification keywords high resolution labrador sea mixed layer depth turbulence eddy kinetic energy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction mesoscale eddies are ubiquitous in the world ocean chelton et al 2011 on length scales of the local baroclinic rossby radius of deformation these vortices yield mesoscale temperature and freshwater fluxes which modify sea water properties and thus change the ocean circulation biogeochemical fluxes and mixed layer properties zhang et al 2014 fröb et al 2016 gaube et al 2019 the labrador sea ls is a region of frequent deep convection during winter and thereby an important place of deep water formation that contributes to overturning circulation and its variability rhein et al 2017 yeager et al 2021 here eddies were observed to contribute to preconditioning before and restratification after deep convection as well as to enable the exchange of water masses between the interior and the boundary current marshall and schott 1999 lilly et al 2003 straneo 2006 palter et al 2008 de jong et al 2014 rykova et al 2015 yashayaev and loder 2016 zhang and yan 2018 zou et al 2021 pacini and pickart 2022 however the transfer of turbulent energy and associated mesoscale tracer fluxes remains unclear due to sparsity of available observations numerical model experiments suggest a complex interplay of barotropic and baroclinic instabilities as the source of eddy kinetic energy eke and associated mesoscale tracer fluxes during winter irminger rings separate from the west greenland current wgc eventually providing buoyant waters for the weakly stratified ls interior in addition convective eddies in the vicinity of the deep convection patch as well as boundary current eddies work to flatten steep isopycnals chanut et al 2008 mcgeehan and maslowski 2011 kawasaki and hasumi 2014 saenko et al 2014 zhang and yan 2014 dukhovskoy et al 2016 rieck et al 2019 tagklis et al 2020 pennelly and myers 2022 in consequence eddy contributions to the total heat flux were found to be on average as important as the mean circulation in the ls however no clear picture was provided whether eddies act to reinforce or work against the mean circulation chanut et al 2008 kawasaki and hasumi 2014 saenko et al 2014 de jong et al 2016 tagklis et al 2020 due to the small local rossby radius of deformation of 10 km and the complex geometry of the ls numerical experiments with realistic high resolution ocean models require high computational costs thus the conducted model simulations in these previous studies usually cover a short period in time and focus on the mean state or the mean annual cycle in this study we use the global ocean model fesom danilov et al 2004 wang et al 2014 with a locally mesoscale resolving horizontal resolution of 5 km and provide a coherent picture of turbulent kinetic energy and associated mesoscale temperature fluxes we integrated the model for 310 years to examine a decadal time scale perspective of the complex ls mixed layer restratification dynamics in addition a low resolution 20 km local horizontal resolution setup serves as control run to investigate the influence of the model resolution this study hence aims to shed light on the temporal variability of mesoscale turbulence in the ls as this was not provided earlier with a realistic high resolution ocean model 2 methods 2 1 ocean model fesom the global finite

sea ls is losing heat to the atmosphere through outgoing longwave radiation and sensible and latent heat fluxes f 0 shading in fig 3a b this heat loss is partly compensated by the boundary current the depth integrated horizontal mean temperature flux convergence exhibits large values along the west greenland current wgc black arrows in fig 3c d in the high resolution run 5 km local horizontal resolution heat is mainly provided by the wgc in a narrow band between the 2 and 3 km isobaths while being removed on and off shore of this patch this spatial tripole was also seen in earlier studies kawasaki and hasumi 2014 tagklis et al 2020 the heat supply continues along the 3 km isobath further downstream a second route of large heat supply establishes at 62 5 that continues along the 2 km isobath throughout the ls in accordance with de jong et al 2016 tagklis et al 2020 the structure of the low resolution 20 km local horizontal resolution boundary current is broader and more homogeneous as in the high resolution setup and provides heat in a large patch between the 2 and 3 km isobaths fig 3c heat is lost on the onshore side of this temperature convergence yielding a large scale dipole pattern in contrast to the numerous convergence divergence patches of the high resolution mean temperature fluxes along the boundary current in the ls interior the mean temperature advection convergence is 1 magnitude smaller compared to the boundary current region in both model setups here divergent and convergent patches coexist next to each other this feature is much more heterogeneous in the high resolution model with a large number of divergent and convergent patches on spatial scales of tens to a few hundreds of km the low resolution ls interior is gaining losing heat in the northeast southwest due to the average circulation the depth integrated temperature flux fluctuations on temporal scales from the model time step to a month i e eddy component see methods follow the main circulation around the ls similarly as the mean component but is 1 magnitude smaller fig 3e f this in contrast to earlier studies chanut et al 2008 saenko et al 2014 kawasaki and hasumi 2014 de jong et al 2016 tagklis et al 2020 and will be discussed later as a consequence the total advection mean eddy fig 4 resembles the mean component the heat supply and removal by the mean circulation is generally enforced by the eddy fluxes in the high resolution setup same sign this is not the case in the northern part of the ls interior as well as further downstream along the 3 km isobath where mean and eddy fluxes mostly compensate in agreement with these studies the low resolution eddy fluxes occur in broader spatial patterns compared to the high resolution setup regions of compensating e g between 1 and 2 km isobaths partly between 2 and 3 km isobaths and enforcing e g ls interior mean and eddy fluxes exist similarly as in the high resolution run the following temporal perspective of the ls dynamics provides further information on the role of the eddy temperature flux component in the ls interior atmospheric forcing triggers deep convection events throughout the observational period fig 5a in positive nao years north atlantic oscillation hurrel 2003 an increased oceanic heat loss to the atmosphere yields a deep mixed layer depth mld here defined as the depth

evolution of the march mld reveals pronounced differences between the low and high resolution model runs while the high resolution mld is in phase with the nao the low resolution model exhibits almost no temporal variability and remains at deep depths fig 5a averaging area outlined by dashed black line fig 3a b in addition the average march low resolution mld spans a much larger area compared to the high resolution setup and observations en4 good et al 2013 other mld thresholds do not change these general differences between the model setups and observations not shown a similar picture emerges for the horizontal eddy temperature advection convergence volume integrated from the surface to the respective mlds within the ls interior index area shown by dashed black line in fig 3a b while the large scale circulation leads to heat loss in the convection zone high resolution eddy fluxes temporarily become active and reduce or even balance this heat loss during deep convection events red line in fig 5c these dynamics are almost absent in the low resolution model where the eddy contribution is much weaker and hardly balances the heat loss due to the mean circulation fig 5b here subgrid scale sgs fluxes are strongly enhanced compared to the negligible values of the high resolution model dashed red lines in fig 5b c however the total temperature advection convergence including the sgs contribution remains negative in the low resolution mixed layer integration over the whole water column suggests an important stabilizing contribution of the mean circulation below the mixed layer fig 6 here mean and eddy temperature advection components compensate the heat loss from the atmospheric forcing yielding a dynamical equilibrium in the high resolution run close agreement between left and right hand sides of eq 1 orange and gray lines in fig 6 bottom this equilibrium is not obtained in the low resolution run where the eddy contribution is too weak and the mean circulation does not work against the forcing fig 6 top the resulting imbalance needs to be closed by horizontal and vertical diffusion including the lon local transport term from the kpp parameterization as well as the vertical component of advection and the parameterized sgs flux dashed black lines in fig 6 3 2 eke generation in the labrador sea the spatial structure of the annual average surface eddy kinetic energy eke follows the wgc and its separation from the coast as shown by the blue isolines of the individual means plus two standard deviations in fig 3a b their numerical values are 124 and 257 cm 2 s 2 for the low and high resolution model runs solid blue lines and 39 cm 2 s 2 for satellite altimetry 1993 to 2009 dashed blue line eke values are twice as large and reach far more into the ls interior in the high compared to the low resolution run the observed spatial eke structure is more similar to the high resolution setup in addition enhanced eke values are found south of the 3 km isobath which is not the case in both model runs absolute values of eke derived from altimetry are much lower than the modeled eke due to the inference from geostrophic currents excluding the ageostrophic component based on daily snapshots excluding variability on shorter time scales on relatively coarse 0 25 horizontal resolution rieck et al 2019 the spatial structure of the modeled depth integrated eke similarly follows the wgc and its separation from the coast as shown by the solid and dashed blue isolines in fig 7a b 5 and 20 m 3 s 2 the 5 m 3 s 2 eke patch is much larger in the high compared to the low resolution model run higher values such as 20 m 3 s 2 are not reached by the latter on average the depth integrated eke peaks in march fig 9e hence eke generating processes will be analyzed for this month in march eke is generated through turbulent wind work f e k e 0 at the sea surface with larger values in the eastern part of the ls fig 7a b the rather homogeneous spatial pattern of eke generation through f e k e reflects that on average the wind stress and surface current anomalies point into the same direction in line with previous studies von storch et al 2007 von storch et al 2012 rimac et al 2016 the depth integrated barotropic hrs leads to eddy growth at the expense of the mean flow on the offshore side of the wgc before and after separation from the greenland coast fig 7c d in a narrow patch between the 1 and 2 km isobaths along the coasts of greenland and canada eddies transfer energy back the mean flow by horizontal shear hrs 0 the high resolution run exhibits much larger values of this barotropic instability compared to the low resolution setup these large hrs values drop by 2 magnitudes towards the ls interior depth integrated baroclinic instability p e k e is responsible for an eke increase almost everywhere in the ls fig 7e f its general pattern resembles the barotropic one with enhanced values along the wgc and the downstream circulation as expected the region of large depth integrated hrs and p e k e corresponds with the depth integrated eke blue isolines in fig 7a b wind forcing is a constant source of eke solid lines and left axis in fig 8a with decadal fluctuations smaller than the average seasonal cycle fig 9a area integrated over the ls interior both model setups exhibit similar f e k e values with small differences probably arising from faster surface currents in the high resolution run volume integrated barotropic and baroclinic eke conversion terms in contrast differ greatly between low and high resolution runs solid lines and left axes in fig 8b c during deep convection events in the early 1970s mid 1980s and early to mid 1990s high resolution barotropic and baroclinic instabilities are strongly enhanced in the ls interior negative hrs and vrs lead to a removal of eke in the ls interior note the smaller order of magnitude for vrs dashed lines and right axis in fig 8b however eddy growth in the ls interior due to baroclinic instabilities p e k e is one magnitude larger than the combined barotropic instabilities k m k e this is also the case in the area of the wgc and its separation from the coast fig 10 hence the evolution of the volume integrated eke closely follows p e k e dashed lines and right axis in fig 8c similar proportions apply to the low resolution run although much reduced in absolute numbers and to the average seasonal cycle fig 9b e eke is removed mainly by dissipation through vertical momentum diffusion and by a much smaller amount bottom drag fig 11 the eke contribution to the total kinetic energy u h 2 2 does not show pronounced peaks during deep water formation events but rather stays around 25 in the low and around 45 in the high resolution run dashed lines and right axis in fig 8a their decadal fluctuations are of similar magnitude as the average seasonal cycle fig 9f 4 discussion the labrador sea as modeled with fesom exhibits a vivid eke field with a pronounced decadal variability at a local horizontal resolution of 5 km this turbulence is strong enough to induce small scale temperature fluxes that lead to an efficient mld restratification fig 5 at a slightly decreased local resolution of 20 km these fluxes are too weak to increase stability parameterized sgs fluxes taken into account and the resulting mld is too deep and its extent too large a common problem of state of the art ocean and climate models danabasoglu et al 2014 heuzé 2021 koenigk et al 2021 in the ls interior the modeled turbulence is mostly of baroclinic origin induced through upward eddy buoyancy fluxes fig 8 our results thus support the view that meso to submesoscale baroclinic instabilities are essential for restratifying the water column after convection baroclinic instability induced through large ageostrophic velocities lavender et al 2002 transport heat upwards morrison et al 2013 saenko 2015 that draws turbulent potential energy from steep isopycnals which thereby flatten fox kemper et al 2008 the large interannual variability of this upward eddy buoyancy flux dominates the temporal evolution of the volume integrated eke fig 8c indicative of important subsurface eke generation hu et al 2020 hence reported non significant surface eke trends of the highly baroclinic and eddy rich gulf stream and kuroshio current derived from satellite altimetry may be underestimated martínez moreno et al 2021 in the area of the wgc and its separation from the coast barotropic instability mainly horizontal shear additionally becomes important for eddy growth eden and böning 2002 but turbulent buoyancy fluxes remain the dominant eke source fig 10 in line with previous studies saenko et al 2014 pacini and pickart 2022 observations indicate that eddies generated within and advected with the boundary current transport heat and salt or freshwater into the ls interior irminger rings jones and marshall 1997 lilly et al 2003 straneo 2006 schmidt and send 2007 rykova et al 2009 de jong et al 2014 rykova et al 2015 this implies that the seawater properties of the boundary current set the restratification ability of the eddies we can confirm this since the efficient mld restratification seen in our high resolution setup was only achieved when the boundary current was not biased too dense and thus being able to provide buoyant water masses i e after some forcing cycles danek et al 2019 hence if no buoyant water is available in the interior or the boundary current upward turbulent buoyancy fluxes as well as eddies from the wbc may not contribute to restratification thomas and zhang 2022 this view is supported by observations luo et al 2012 pacini and pickart 2022 and model results where a suppressed turbulence in the wgc led to an underestimation of transports of heat into the ls interior by irminger rings and a deeper mld gelderloos et al 2011 kawasaki and hasumi 2014 rieck et al 2019 pennelly and myers 2022 previous studies using realistic high resolution ocean models found that on the long term average mean and eddy temperature flux convergence are of equal importance in the ls chanut et al 2008 saenko et al 2014 kawasaki and hasumi 2014 de jong et al 2016 tagklis et al 2020 common to some of these studies is an eddy definition that incorporates deviations from a relatively long period e g 5 chanut et al 2008 saenko et al 2014 7 tagklis et al 2020 or 14 years de jong et al 2016 our eddy component in contrast represents fluctuations on much shorter time scales from the model time step to a month von storch et al 2012 we thereby provide another perspective on the mean eddy interplay on the long term average 1948 2009 the eddy temperature fluxes are much weaker than the mean component also in the high resolution setup whereby the total advection resembles the mean component compare figs 3c d and 4 triggered by strong forcing however the eddy component greatly increases playing a role equally important as the mean circulation as long as the spatial resolution is high enough which is in accordance with the cited studies above figs 5b c and 6 hence together with the notion that a longer averaging period leads to larger deviations from that average rieck et al 2015 this physically consistent picture was not documented earlier due to the missing decadal temporal perspective in kawasaki and hasumi 2014 however the temporal average of mean and eddy heat flux components are of similar magnitude although the same eddy definition as in this study was used in contrast to our 62 years of 6 h atmospheric forcing they utilized a daily climatology representing the years 1979 to 1993 to force their ocean model this time period is biased towards a positive nao phase and thus enhanced heat loss in the ls röske 2006 for this period our high resolution run indeed shows a similar importance of mean and eddy components of heat fluxes integrated over the mixed layer fig 5b c and the whole water column fig 6 hence it may be that the heat flux composition presented by kawasaki and hasumi 2014 rather represent a positive nao state and not a general temporal average the complex spatial structure of the high resolution heat flux convergence due to the construction via the divergence operator is difficult to interpret and may require more averaging than applied in this study for example spatial smoothing was used to obtain a more coherent picture chanut et al 2008 saenko et al 2014 on the other hand small scale features may get lost due to smoothing as for example the heat loss patch on the onshore side of the wgc due to the mean circulation kawasaki and hasumi 2014 tagklis et al 2020 this study another example is the interplay between mean and eddy temperature fluxes in the wgc which were shown to generally work against each other opposite sign chanut et al 2008 saenko et al 2014 kawasaki and hasumi 2014 de jong et al 2016 our high resolution eddy temperature fluxes in contrast tend to enforce the mean wgc same sign this is also seen in tagklis et al 2020 where a higher model resolution seems to yield a larger agreement of the signs of mean and eddy flux components over large parts of the wgc within the 2 and 3 km isobaths hence a general relationship between the type of instability and effects of the resulting eddy fluxes i e to enforce or oppose mean fluxes remains unclear albeit the relatively high spatial resolution the eddy temperature fluxes are not strong enough to efficiently limit the spatial extent of the mld in the high resolution setup especially to the northeast of the deep ls interior where the mld patch is too large compared to observations irrespective of mld threshold recent model results suggest that too many vertical model levels 61 in our high resolution setup and a thereby too smooth slope geometry reduces turbulence and hence small scale tracer fluxes gillard et al 2022 our low resolution model reveals further challenges first the usually utilized sgs parameterization gent and mcwilliams 1990 of eddy fluxes is too weak to mimic meaningful effects of turbulence second in the ls interior where complicated ocean dynamics and steep topography work in concert large diapycnal buoyancy fluxes from the vertical mixing scheme and dissipation seem necessary to obtain a dynamical equilibrium rest term in fig 6 this points to the importance of mixing and non linearities in the ls interior morrison et al 2013 griffies et al 2015 corre et al 2020 but is beyond the scope of this study 5 concluding remarks to conclude eddy fluxes on spatio temporal scales of a few km from the model time step to a month significantly contribute to tracer advection and facilitate mixed layer restratification in the ls after deep convection events these eddy fluxes are mainly of baroclinic origin and their interannual variability is coupled to the atmospheric forcing i e turbulence is strongly enhanced during periods of large oceanic heat loss and quiescent otherwise buoyant water from the boundary current needs to be available to increase stratification in the ls interior a higher spatial model resolution clearly improves the spatial temporal structure of the ls deep convection in addition future work should concentrate on the systematic improvement of eddy and mixing parameterizations used in climate models especially in challenging regions like the labrador sea moreover methodological definitions of e g spatio temporal flux decomposition and smoothing techniques

23787,based on a numerical hydrodynamic model and lagrangian particle tracking method the lagrangian flow network and the lagrangian residual velocity were derived to exhibit the mass transport pattern in the tide dominant bohai sea the characteristics of the lagrangian flow network represented by degree and hydrodynamic provinces show distinct regional features in the central basin and the three bays the first order lagrangian residual velocity i e the mass transport velocity can be well maintained over a dozen averaging tidal periods with its magnitude slightly decreasing with the increasing number of tidal periods the second order lagrangian residual velocity i e the lagrangian drift velocity includes the dependence on the initial tidal phase which is also weakened with the increasing number of tidal periods the mechanism behind the above two features of the lagrangian residual velocity is explained theoretically in the bohai sea with about 15 averaging tidal periods the lagrangian residual velocity is approximately independent of the initial tidal phase and close to the mass transport velocity the streamlines of the lagrangian residual velocity averaged over 15 tidal periods are parallel to the province boundaries in the lagrangian flow network which means that the lagrangian flow network is determined by the lagrangian residual current this may lay the foundation for using lagrangian flow network to analyze and quantify flow and transport pathways in shallow tide dominated coastal regions keywords lagrangian flow network lagrangian residual velocity mass transport bohai sea data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction mass transport mainly caused by the advection and diffusion processes in the ocean is of primary importance when studying the offshore shallow sea environment briton et al 2018 mclachlan et al 2020 mitarai et al 2009 prants et al 2011 sunday et al 2014 it determines the spread of pollutants al muzaini 2013 nutrients hu et al 2008 and organisms gerber et al 2014 in the ocean and in certain circumstances it can be related to human activities halpern et al 2008 syvitski et al 2005 xu et al 2016 for example mass transport processes can regulate nutrient transport washburn and mcphee shaw 2013 and drive the motion of the planktons dambach et al 2016 to influence the marine ecosystem human activities such as land reclamation pelling et al 2013 and ocean engineering tang et al 2017 can change the flow field and the turbulent intensity to affect the mass transport processes in the ocean advection often makes the dominant contribution to mass transport bonhomme et al 2007 delhez 1996 wei et al 2016 advection determines the connections between different subregions in the study area which can be described by the concept of a flow network based on network theory newman 2003 phillips et al 2015 zou et al 2019 therein subregions can be represented by nodes in the flow network and the connections can be abstracted to the edges or links donner et al 2017 rossi et al 2014 in recent years the concept of the flow network has been applied in many oceanographic studies ranging from coastal pearson et al 2020 basin rossi et al 2014 to global scales froyland et al 2014 jönsson and watson 2016 particularly when the target matter floats with the current such as microplastics zambianchi et al 2017 fish larvae dubois et al 2016 or suspended sediment pearson et al 2020 the mass transport process can be studied by establishing the lagrangian flow network through the lagrangian particle tracking rossi et al 2016 the pattern of mass transport revealed in the flow network provides essential knowledge for marine management and environment improvement fujiwara et al 2017 ser giacomi et al 2015 2021b however the mechanism behind the pattern given by the flow network is not fully understood because of the dominant role played by the flow field one would expect that the flow network follows the current however the presence of multi temporal scales in the flow field makes it challenging to derive the representative current at a proper scale this issue may be less severe for the global or basin scales when the mass transport processes are mainly caused by relatively steady ocean currents jönsson and watson 2016 rossi et al 2014 the issue becomes more evident in the shallow sea environment with the presence of significant temporal variations because of tides buschman et al 2009 izquierdo and mikolajewicz 2019 yanagi and tamaru 1990 zhou et al 2020 zhu et al 2016 however even in coastal seas the structure of the flow network can be stable without evident temporal variations hence representing the long term mass transport patterns pearson et al 2020 yu et al 2021 these results reveal discrepancies between the temporal variated flow field and the stable flow network structure which has yet to be studied thus to explain the feature of the stable pattern of flow network in coastal seas this study aims to find the corresponding steady current without explicit tidal signals in the tide dominant shallow seas the concept of the residual current can be traced back to the 1960s abbott 1960 hunt 1961 the residual current is the average of the instantaneous current in a certain sense to remove the tidal signal the definitions of the residual current fall into two categories one is the lagrangian residual velocity defined as the net displacement of a water parcel over one or several tidal periods divided by the elapsed time e g feng et al 2008 the other is the eulerian residual velocity which is the average of the current at each fixed location e g wang et al 2013 many previous studies have found that the lagrangian residual velocity can represent the mass transport process in the inter tidal time scale while the eulerian residual velocity cannot cheng and casulli 1982 das et al 2000 feng et al 1986b guillou and chapalain 2017 longuet higgins 1969 defined the mass transport velocity according to the lagrangian residual velocity which is the sum of eulerian residual velocity and the stokes drift velocity for fluctuating large scale currents in follow on studies the mass transport velocity is proved to be the first order approximation of the lagrangian residual velocity under weakly nonlinear conditions for the 2d vertically averaged case feng et al 1986a and for the 3d case feng 1986 and in both cases the lagrangian residual velocity is extended to a second order approximation the second order term referred to as the lagrangian drift velocity varies with the initial tidal phase that is related to the release time of a water parcel in a tidal period this explains why the lagrangian residual velocity is influenced by the initial tidal phase as found in many studies dortch et al 1992 muller et al 2009 zimmerman 1979 because the flow network is generally steady in a tide dominant shallow sea its feature may be more related to the time invariant mass transport velocity in this study the bohai sea a typical tide dominant shallow sea located on the northwest coast of the pacific ocean e g bian et al 2016 sündermann and feng 2004 is selected to demonstrate the mass transport pattern presented by the lagrangian flow network and to reveal the mechanism from the perspective of the lagrangian residual velocity this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the concepts of the lagrangian flow network and the lagrangian residual velocity and describes the numerical method for acquiring them section 3 illustrates the characteristics of the lagrangian flow network and the lagrangian residual velocity in the bohai sea section 4 discusses the mechanism of the lagrangian flow network expressed by the lagrangian residual velocity and the long term mass transport pattern section 5 gives the conclusions of this study 2 theory and methods 2 1 construction of the lagrangian flow network according to the network theory the essential elements in a network are nodes edges and topology newman 2003 nodes are basic units and subregions in the flow field edges represent the connections among the nodes i e the connectivity between different subregions of the fluid area in the network edges can be directed or undirected and they can also be weighted depending on the connectivity in the fluid if a water parcel in subregion a can move to subregion b following the current this corresponds to a directed edge from subregion a to b and its weight can be defined as the time of water parcel movement edges can be calculated by the lagrangian particle tracking method in such a case the nodes and the derived edges form the lagrangian flow network lfn the network s topology is demonstrated by certain characteristic parameters calculated from the nodes and edges fujiwara et al 2017 rossi et al 2016 which can reveal the key regions and processes for mass transport ser giacomi et al 2015 2 1 1 nodes of the lagrangian flow network when dividing the study area into subregions to form the lfn nodes the primary determining factor is the spatial scale of subregions this relies on understanding the dominant hydrodynamics in the study area in reality multi scale hydrodynamic processes in the ocean usually consist of one dominant process characterizing the large scale and slow varying motions and others characterizing small scale and high frequency motions the spatial scale of each node should be small enough so that the dominant hydrodynamical process can be identified while large enough to smooth out the small scale motions the first requirement means that the size of each node should be at least one order smaller than the spatial scale of the dominant hydrodynamical process the second requirement defines the lower limit of the scale of a node which is in the same order as the scale of the small scale motions the final output is an lfn formulated with m nodes obtained by dividing the study area into m subregions with a specific appropriate spatial resolution 2 1 2 edges of the lagrangian flow network in lfn edges can be defined as a matrix based on the connection conditions among different nodes here the connection between two nodes means that the water parcel in one node can move to another node in a fixed length of time t n under different connection conditions different types of edges can be defined phillips et al 2015 if a water parcel in node i flows to node j over t n this refers to a directional connection from i to j and a directed edge d i j 1 in lfn where i and j are the starting and ending nodes respectively if over t n no water parcel in node i can flow to node j then d i j is set to 0 edge d i j indicates whether the connection between node i and node j exists but does not include the extent of the connection thus d i j i j denotes the directed and unweighted edges in lfn in a node pair i j d i j 1 means that there are water parcels moving from node i to node j over t n while the time taken for different water parcels may differ the shortest time taken denoted as e i j represents the minimum connecting time from node i to node j if d i j 0 i e no connection exists between node i and node j over t n e i j is set to 0 edge e i j defined by the minimum connecting time embodies a kind of connection extent between nodes i and j the established e i j i j denotes the directed and weighted edges in lfn if the connection direction is not considered the undirected and weighted edges w i j i j can be defined as 1 w i j min e i j e j i e i j e j i 0 max e i j e j i e i j e j i 0 and e i j e j i 0 0 e i j e j i 0 that is w i j 0 if there is no edge between node i and node j w i j 0 is set to the non zero value e i j or e j i if there is an edge in one direction only i e either e i j 0 e j i 0 or e i j 0 e j i 0 and w i j is set to the minimum of e i j and e j i if edges of both directions between node i and node j exist determining the connection between nodes is the key procedure to find the different kinds of edges the detailed procedure to get the directed and weighted edges e i j was described in our previous research yu et al 2021 firstly the particles are placed uniformly in the study area with the spatial resolution of the initial positions of the particles being at least one order of magnitude smaller than the scale of the nodes then the positions of the particles are updated by calculating their trajectories following the flow field passively over a certain time interval with the trajectories of particles at different time instances recorded finally the above defined edges can be obtained by analyzing the trajectories of the particles 2 1 3 topology of the lagrangian flow network based on the information on nodes and edges the topological structure of lfn can be established which portrays additional connection relationships besides edges it can be used to identify the dynamical barriers or the corridors and to discuss the transport pattern in the flow field ser giacomi et al 2021a the expression of the topological structure relies on the quantitative characteristic parameters of the network in this study two parameters namely the degree and province are selected to represent the topological structure of lfn they are calculated by edges and node pairs and are used to obtain a general and stable mass transport pattern in the bohai sea specifically the degree is defined as the number of edges pointing out of a particular node i e out degree or pointing into this node i e in degree newman 2010 ser giacomi et al 2015 2017 hence the out degree of node i equals to j d i j and the in degree of node i equals to j d j i the values of out degree and in degree quantitatively display the output and input transport dominated by the advection by current over time the hydrodynamic province in the flow network is the cluster of nodes the nodes in the same province are well connected among themselves while most of them do not connect with other nodes outside the province phillips et al 2015 boundaries between provinces have been proven to coincide with oceanographic features in previous studies and have been used to identify the flow barriers for domain connectivity and to design marine reserves for larval dispersion rossi et al 2014 reijnders et al 2020 the hydrodynamic province a comprehensive result of fluid movement over a certain length of time can describe the pattern of long term mass transport 2 2 theory of the lagrangian residual velocity the lagrangian residual velocity lrv is formulated to represent the steady current in the tide dominated shallow sea after filtering out the tidal oscillation in the following the first order and second order approximations of lrv are introduced briefly in the following discussion the variables are dimensionless except noted specifically in the weakly nonlinear tidal system the shallow water long wave equation can describe the water motion which is nondimensionalized by the tidal period and wavelength or the horizontal basin scale then according to the dimensionless shallow water long wave equation and continuity equation a nonlinearity parameter κ is defined as 2 κ ζ c h c l c l c where ζ c is the characteristic tidal amplitude h c is the characteristic basin depth l c is the tidal excursion scale in one tidal period and l c is the horizontal scale of the basin or the tidal wavelength the tidal velocity u can be expanded by using the perturbation technique as 3 u x θ u 0 x θ κ u 1 x θ o κ 2 where x represents the spatial position θ denotes time which is related to the tidal phase u 0 is the zeroth order tidal velocity and u 1 is the first order tidal velocity the tidal averaging operator is introduced as follows 4 f 1 2 π n θ 0 θ 0 2 π n f d θ where f is the averaged variable n is the number of the averaging tidal periods and θ 0 is the initial tidal phase 5 u 0 u 0 cos θ u 0 sin θ 6 u 1 u 1 cos 2 θ u 1 sin 2 θ u er where u 0 u 0 u 1 and u 1 vary only with space and u er is the eulerian residual velocity erv at the initial position x 0 defined by 7 u er x 0 u x 0 θ u 1 x 0 θ o κ according to the definition of the lagrangian residual velocity feng et al 2008 the lrv u lr can be expressed as 8 u lr u x θ where x x 0 κ n ξ is the water parcel s trajectory in n tidal periods ξ is the lagrangian displacement of the water parcel represented by 9 n ξ θ 0 θ u x 0 κ n ξ θ d θ where n 1 n 1 κ represents the ratio between the tidal excursion of n tidal periods and one period feng 1986 if n is chosen to be smaller than o κ 1 to keep o n 1 the tidal velocity u can have a taylor expansion at x 0 substitute this taylor expansion into the perturbation form of u x θ in eq 3 to have 10 u x θ u 0 x 0 θ κ u 1 x 0 θ κ n ξ 0 θ x 0 θ 0 u 0 x x 0 o κ 2 the lrv from different orders of approximation can be obtained by substituting eq 10 into eq 8 the first and second order approximations of lrv are given below 2 2 1 the first order approximation of the lagrangian residual velocity the first order approximation of the lagrangian residual velocity is called the mass transport velocity mtv which can be expressed as 11 u mt u er u sd u sd is called the stokes drift velocity sdv which is expressed as 12 u sd n ξ 0 u 0 where the zeroth order lagrangian displacement is 13 n ξ 0 θ 0 θ u 0 x 0 θ d θ eqs 7 and 12 show that u er and u sd and hence the mass transport velocity are not affected by the initial tidal phase but they may depend on the number of the averaging tidal periods the impacts of tidal periods on lrv will be described in the results section and the underlying mechanism will be explored in the discussions section in addition the eulerian residual velocity is proven not to satisfy the conservation equation for a material surface thus leading to a break in the continuity of the flow field hence that it cannot be used to express mass transport process feng et al 2008 the pattern of erv will be presented in the discussions section where the limitation of erv on the mass transport process will be discussed briefly 2 2 2 the second order approximation of the lagrangian residual velocity the lagrangian residual velocity perturbation can be further expanded to the second order to get 14 u lr u mt κ u ld o κ 2 where u ld is lagrangian drift velocity ldv that includes the influence of the initial phase on lrv the ldv was deduced by feng et al 1986a and is expressed by 15 u ld u ld cos θ 0 u ld sin θ 0 where 16 u ld u 0 u mt u mt u 0 and u ld u 0 u mt u mt u 0 represent the interaction of the tidal current and mtv if the water parcel with the initial phase θ 0 0 2 π is tracked over one tidal period the end position of the water parcel can form an ellipse that is called the lagrangian drift ellipse the magnitude of the lagrangian drift velocity can be estimated by dividing the length of the semi major axis of the lagrangian drift ellipse by the tidal period based on the second order approximation of the lagrangian residual velocity the lagrangian drift velocity is one order of magnitude smaller than the mass transport velocity and the spatial scale of the lagrangian drift ellipse of one tidal period is κ 3 l c the conceptual diagram of lrv with different orders of approximation can be found in fig 1 of feng et al 1986a it shows the interrelations among the lagrangian residual velocity the mass transport velocity the eulerian residual velocity the stokes drift velocity the lagrangian drift velocity and the lagrangian drift ellipse the influence of the initial phase on the lagrangian residual velocity will vary with the number of tidal periods the impacts of the initial phase and tidal periods on the second order lrv will be presented and discussed in the results and discussions sections 2 3 numerical model 2 3 1 hydrodynamic model configuration the finite volume community ocean model fvcom chen et al 2006 was used to simulate the tidal hydrodynamics in the whole bohai sea and the north yellow sea fig 1 the model fits the shoreline well by adopting the varying spatial resolution from 5 000 m offshore to 200 m nearshore achieved via using the unstructured triangular mesh and the number of vertical sigma layers is 5 the horizontal and vertical mixing parameterizations adopt the smagorinsky eddy parameterization scheme and mellor and yamada level 2 5 turbulence closure model respectively the quadratic bottom friction is applied and the bottom roughness coefficient is set as 0 001 the external and internal time steps are set as 1 s and 10 s for mode splitting the hydrodynamic model is run for 60 periods of m 2 tide with the imposed open boundary condition of single frequency tide m 2 the details of the model configuration and validation can be found in yu et al 2021 in this study only the surface velocity field is used to calculate the particle trajectories to obtain the lagrangian flow network and the lagrangian residual velocity this is because on the one hand barotropic processes dominate the tidal current in the bohai sea whose characteristics can be well represented by the sea surface velocity on the other hand the lagrangian flow network is mainly used to represent the motion of buoyant particles that are transported at the surface such as the microplastics 2 3 2 the lagrangian particle tracking method the fourth order runge kutta scheme is applied to calculate the particle trajectories at the surface of the bohai sea without including the effects of random walking in the case that a particle arrives at the land boundary it will be removed at the next time step more than 70 000 particles are initially released with a spatial resolution of 1 km in the bohai sea the time step for the lagrangian particle tracking is 12 min and the integration time lasts from 1 to 60 tidal periods in different experiments the particle tracking results are used to analyze the influence of the initial phase and integration time on the lagrangian residual velocity in addition the particle trajectories are traced for 1 800 tidal periods by reusing the simulated 60 tidal periods flow field to construct the lagrangian flow network this ensures the relatively stable structure of the lagrangian flow network 2 3 3 the lagrangian flow network construction in the bohai sea several temporally and spatially varying dynamic factors exist such as the river input wind stress and stratification but the tide is the dominant and permanent dynamic factor the spatial scale of the tide excursion is 10 km therefore 10 km is selected as the spatial resolution for the division of subregions nodes and this results in a lagrangian flow network consisting of a total of 749 nodes to show the impacts of the node s size on lfn two experiments with node sizes of 20 km and 5 km are carried out with the results presented and analyzed in the results and discussions sections in addition the seeding resolution of 1 km is suitable for the acquisition of edges such a seeding resolution is one order of magnitude smaller than the node s size of 10 km thus can resolve the connection relationship through the connecting time between nodes and prove the good applicable ability of the lagrangian flow network rossi et al 2014 ser giacomi et al 2017 based on particle trajectories over 1 800 tidal periods the minimum connecting time between pairs of nodes is counted in the number of m 2 tidal periods to establish the edges e i j i j in the bohai sea the directed unweighted edges d i j i j and undirected weighted edges w i j i j are extracted to calculate the topological structure the out degree and in degree are calculated through d i j i j by their definition the acquisition of the province in the network can be accomplished via a variety of algorithms therein modularity is a parameter that can quantitatively evaluate the results of province partition whose definition is the sum of the weight of edges inside the provinces minus the sum of the weight of edges in the stochastic cases expressed by 17 q 1 2 m i j a i j k i k j 2 m δ c i c j where q represents modularity a i j is the weight of the edge from node i to node j m 1 2 i j a i j represents the sum of the weight of all edges k i j a i j represents the sum of the weight of edges from node i to all nodes k i k j 2 m represents the probability that node i and node j can be connected and δ c i c j 1 c i c j 0 c i c j with c i being the province that node i belongs to in this study the louvain algorithm whose principle is the modularity maximization newman and girvan 2004 blondel et al 2008 is applied for hydrodynamic province calculation through the input variable w i j i j lequeux et al 2018 the louvain algorithm for hydrodynamic province calculation is implemented by a library called louvain in python traag and bruggeman 2009 2 3 4 the lagrangian residual velocity calculation the lagrangian residual velocity is defined as the net displacement of a water parcel over one or several tidal periods divided by the elapsed time as presented by eq 8 the lrv is derived using the trajectories of particles with 1 km seeding resolution although the spatial resolution of the hydrodynamic model ranges from 5 000 m offshore to 200 m nearshore the areas with a spatial resolution from 200 m to 1 km are mainly located near the shoreline while in most study areas the spatial resolution of the model is larger than 1 km therefore we expect that setting the seeding resolution smaller than 1 km will not change the pattern of lrv lrvs with different initial tidal phases and the number of tidal periods driven by the single frequency tide are calculated separately the first order approximation of lrv i e the mass transport velocity is calculated by averaging the lrvs with different initial phases according to the form of the lagrangian drift velocity revealed in eq 15 ldv is obtained by calculating the difference between lrvs with different initial phases and mtv the integration time of lrv ranges from 1 period of m 2 12 42 h to 60 periods meanwhile 12 initial phases with 1 hour intervals apart denoted as phase 01 to phase 12 that represent 0 to 11 h after a certain starting time t 0 are also selected to analyze the influence of the initial phase on lrv 3 results 3 1 characteristics of the lagrangian flow network in the bohai sea the lagrangian flow network of the bohai sea is constructed two other characteristics i e degree and hydrodynamic provinces are obtained and their topological structures are stabilized after simulations over 1500 tidal periods thus the results presented below are the lagrangian flow network structures based on particle trajectories over 1500 tidal periods 3 1 1 distribution of degrees the degree of the lagrangian flow network based on the directed unweighted edges d i j i j is shown in fig 2 the out degree and in degree show different regional features the out degree presents high values in the liaodong bay and much smaller values in the central basin and the other two bays fig 2 a the in degree shows much higher values around the central basin i e near the entrances to the bohai bay and laizhou bay and the southern part of the bohai strait and relatively smaller values elsewhere fig 2 b the distributions of out degree and in degree calculated with node sizes of 20 km and 5 km are presented by fig b 1 in appendix b respectively the main regional features of the distributions are consistent with that shown in fig 2 hence the following analyses of the mass transport process will be based on the results using a 10 km node size based on the definition of the degree the regions with larger values of the out degree are where particles tend to leave following the current thus according to fig 2 a materials in the liaodong bay are more likely to be transported to other areas conversely the nodes with higher in degree values tend to receive material from a greater diversity of source nodes according to fig 2 b there is a continuous transport pathway going around the western and southern boundaries of the central basin and reaching the southern part of the bohai strait the transport of materials from the bohai sea to the outside area yellow sea through the southern part of the bohai strait is consistent with the results of earlier studies e g guan 1994 3 1 2 hydrodynamic provinces by applying the louvain algorithm five hydrodynamic provinces emerge naturally to divide the whole bohai sea as shown by different colors in fig 3 among them the bohai bay is a single province red zone the laizhou bay and the southern central basin form another province orange zone and the liaodong bay and central basin form three provinces blue green and purple zones from east to west the hydrodynamic provinces obtained with node sizes of 20 km and 5 km are shown in fig b 2 in appendix b the overall distributions are similar to that based on a node size of 10 km the case of 20 km node size still gets five provinces while the case of 5 km node size obtains ten provinces showing more detailed regional variation the following analysis will continue based on the results of the 10 km node size to quantitatively assess the partition quality of hydrodynamic provinces we count the number of undirected edges inside each province and between different provinces and the results are summarized in table 1 the total number of undirected edges in the bohai sea is 42244 74 of the number of all the edges is inside each province this suggests that the water parcels connect with each other closely inside each province which quantitatively illustrates a good performance of the partition by hydrodynamic provinces the locations and separation of hydrodynamic provinces fig 3 show correspondence to the distribution of degrees fig 2 the provinces of the bohai bay and laizhou bay red and orange zones both have small values of out degree and in degree indicating that their low exchange with other areas provinces the provinces located in the central basin and southeastern liaodong bay green and blue zones also have small out degree and in degree values the province extending from the head of the liaodong bay to the western and southern boundaries of the central basin purple zone presents the transition from areas with high out degree values in the north to high in degree values in the south this pattern of degree structure depicts an evident pathway for material transport i e running from the liaodong bay along the western coast around the western and southern boundaries of the central basin and finally exiting the bohai sea through the southern part of the bohai strait 3 2 characteristics of the lagrangian residual velocity the lagrangian residual velocity induced by the m 2 the dominant tidal constituent in the bohai sea is discussed below according to the theoretical results summarized in section 2 2 the lrv at a specific location is influenced by the initial phase and the number of tracking tidal periods 3 2 1 spatial pattern and magnitude of the mass transport velocity as the first order approximation of the lagrangian residual velocity the mass transport velocity over one tidal period is calculated with its magnitude filled color and pattern white curves presented in fig 4 in the bohai sea the magnitude of mtv is greater than 2 cm s near most coastal areas and decreases toward the interior the minimum magnitude of smaller than 0 5 cm s occurs in the central basin mtv shows a general counter clockwise circulation in the bohai sea starting from the liaodong bay going through the central basin and the northeastern laizhou bay and finally flowing out through the bohai strait there are several localized eddies in the three bays including the counter clockwise eddies in the northern and eastern liaodong bay clockwise eddies in the northern and southern bohai bay counter clockwise eddy in the western bohai bay and a clockwise eddy in the laizhou bay in the bohai strait mtv points inward in the north and directs outward in the south fig 5 a shows that the magnitude of the mass transport velocity induced by the m 2 tide in the whole bohai sea decreases with the increasing number of tidal periods specifically the area averaged mtv is 0 9 cm s for one period and 0 5 cm s for 60 periods the magnitude of the mass transport velocity also varies with the value of the nonlinearity parameter κ defined by eq 2 the spatial distribution of κ is shown in fig 5 b calculated by taking ζ c the characteristic value of the tidal elevation as the monthly mean of tidal amplitude it can be seen that κ is smaller than 0 05 in most areas of the bohai sea and can be larger than 0 1 only in coastal areas fig 5 c shows the variations of the magnitude of mtv averaged over areas with different ranges of the values of κ as functions of the tidal period the magnitude of mtv is smaller for smaller values of κ for instance the magnitude of mtv for one tidal period is about 0 8 cm s for areas with κ 0 10 and 0 5 cm s for areas with κ 0 01 furthermore the magnitude of mtv decreases slower with the tidal periods for smaller values of κ for example the mtv magnitude for 60 tidal periods is 60 of that for one tidal period for κ 0 10 while 80 for κ 0 01 the dependence of the mass transport velocity on the number of averaging tidal periods is illustrated in fig 6 the magnitude of mtv shows evident reduction with the increasing number of tidal periods in the coastal areas where the nonlinearity is stronger consistent with the dependence on different ranges of κ values shown in fig 5 c on the other hand the patterns of mtv show an evident variation with the averaging tidal periods e g the main counter clockwise pattern in the whole bohai sea is maintained for tidal periods of 15 30 45 and 60 hence the number of averaging tidal periods mainly affects the magnitude rather than the pattern of mtv 3 2 2 spatial pattern of the lagrangian residual velocity and the influence of initial tidal phases if approximated to the second order the lagrangian residual velocity can be affected by the initial phase fig 7 presents the lrv averaged over one tidal period from initial phases of 01 04 07 and 10 corresponding to the initial time of 0 3 6 and 9 h after t 0 the magnitudes and patterns for the four phases are fairly similar close to that of the mass transport velocity shown in fig 4 only the streamlines of lrv in the central basin are slightly different the weak influence of the initial tidal phase on lrv is related to the weak nonlinearity of the bohai sea the dependence of the second order lagrangian residual velocity i e the lagrangian drift velocity on the averaging tidal periods is shown in fig 8 a similar to the mass transport velocity fig 5 c the ldv magnitude decreases with the increasing number of tidal periods and the decreasing rate is lower for smaller κ values fig 8 b shows the magnitude ratio of ldv to mtv with the increasing number of tidal periods the ldv mtv decreases in the same way as mtv does this suggests that the influence of the initial phase on lrv included in ldv becomes weaker with the increasing number of tidal periods and with decreasing strength of nonlinearity represented by the κ values next we calculate the correlation coefficients between u 1 v 1 and u 2 v 2 the fields of the lagrangian residual velocity and mass transport velocity in the whole bohai sea respectively the correlations are computed for the eastward and northward components denoted as corr u 1 u 2 and corr v 1 v 2 respectively and for u 1 v 1 of different initial phases 01 12 corresponding to 0 11 h after t 0 fig 9 shows the correlations with the different numbers of averaging tidal periods the correlation coefficients of both u and v components rise rapidly with the number of tidal periods increasing from 1 to 10 and then rise gradually from 10 to 60 tidal periods the difference among correlations for lrv of different initial phases is larger for smaller numbers of tidal periods and becomes smaller with the increasing number of tidal periods considering that both mtv and the influence of the initial phase on lrv decrease with the increasing number of tidal periods we suggest that the mass transport process in the bohai sea can be represented by lrv averaged over 15 tidal periods which is approximately equal to mtv and is not significantly affected by the initial tidal phase 4 discussions 4 1 decrease of the magnitude of mass transport velocity with the increasing number of averaging tidal periods to discuss the dependence of the magnitude of the mass transport velocity on the number of tidal periods ξ ij is used to denote the net displacement of a water parcel from the end of the i th tidal period to the end of the j th tidal period in reality the tidal current varies in space thus ξ ij for adjacent i j pairs are not always in the same direction to form a straight line rather considering the first two adjacent tidal cycles the initial position and the two ending positions most likely form a triangle i e ξ 02 ξ 01 ξ 12 for n tidal periods the net displacement from the initial to the end of the n th tidal cycle should satisfy 18 ξ 0 n ξ 01 ξ 12 ξ n 1 n since the mass transport velocity is the net displacement divided by the tidal periods mtv averaged over multiple tidal periods should be generally smaller than that over one tidal period this can be demonstrated using the example of a sverdrup wave following feng et al 1986a its zeroth order velocity field is given in eq a 13 in appendix a based on eq 10 the lagrangian residual velocity is calculated for different initial phases of θ 0 π 6 π 3 2 π different nonlinearity parameter values of κ 0 05 0 10 and 0 20 over one to 3200 tidal periods fig 10 presents the results with f 0 4 and the initial position of the water parcel x 0 y 0 0 0 the magnitudes of the mass transport velocity show fluctuating trends with the number of tidal periods the fluctuations become weaker with the increase of the number of tidal periods and become steady for a smaller number of tidal periods with increasing value of κ note that this special case of a sverdrup wave includes no viscosity over an infinite space in reality the presence of viscosity leads to a faster decrease in the magnitude of the mass transport velocity with the increasing number of tidal periods and particle tracking cannot be carried out over a large number of tidal periods because the water parcel can hit the shoreline thus only the first decreasing phase in fig 10 applies to the real ocean situation also according to fig 10 the stronger nonlinearity cases exhibit a faster decrease of the mass transport velocity with the increasing number of tidal periods in the bohai sea the nonlinearity is weak and the mass transport velocity decreases slowly and becomes steady over a dozen tidal periods 4 2 dependence of the lagrangian residual velocity on the initial tidal phase in the bohai sea the lagrangian drift velocity the second order lagrangian residual velocity gradually decreases with the increasing number of the averaging tidal periods and shows a weak dependence on the initial tidal phase the underlying reason is now explored under the idealized condition that the mass transport velocity and lagrangian drift velocity are constant over any tidal period the scale of lagrangian drift ellipse over multi tidal periods is analyzed first for a water parcel starting from an initial tidal phase during its continuous movement in the tidal flow its ending position after n tidal periods will be located on the lagrangian drift ellipse with a scale of n κ 3 l c according to appendix a in the real sea the continuous movement of a water parcel may experience changes in the mass transport velocity and lagrangian drift velocity due to the spatial variations of the magnitude of the tidal current in this case the ending position of the water parcel after n tidal periods cannot always be located at the outer envelope of the lagrangian drift ellipse the scale of the lagrangian drift ellipse is smaller than n κ 3 l c the magnitude of ldv will decrease with the increasing number of tidal periods and the influence of the initial phase is weakened thus the lrv is closer to mtv if the tracking of the water parcels covers more tidal periods in the bohai sea mtv can be regarded as a good approximation to lrv after 15 tidal periods taking a sverdrup wave as an example section 4 1 appendix a the ratio of the lagrangian drift velocity to the mass transport velocity for κ 0 05 0 10 and 0 20 are calculated as a measure of the influence of the initial phase on the lagrangian residual velocity as shown in fig 11 the ratio of ldv to mtv shows a fluctuant while decreasing behavior with the increasing number of tidal periods evidencing that the influence of the initial phase on ldv is gradually becoming smaller the ratio and the influence of the initial phase are smaller for smaller κ weaker nonlinearity the results for the idealized case of a sverdrup wave are consistent with that in the bohai sea 4 3 relationship between the lagrangian flow network and the lagrangian residual velocity fig 2 and fig 3 a depict the streamlines of the lagrangian residual velocity averaged over 15 tidal periods the pattern of the lagrangian residual velocity can explain the distributions of the out degree and in degree shown in fig 2 the values of the out degree and in degree are both relatively small in the bohai bay and laizhou bay and this is related to the local eddies in these areas the streamlines of the lrv show a large scale structure that starts from the liaodong bay then turns counter clockwise and finally flows outward this corresponds to high values of the out degree to the north of the central basin and high values of the in degree to the south the high values of in degree in the southern part of the bohai strait correspond to the eastern streamlines outward of the bohai sea the lagrangian residual velocity averaged over 15 tidal periods can also help to interpret the mass transport pattern revealed by the results of the hydrodynamic province as shown in fig 3 a the lrv streamlines in an individual province are coherent and structured provinces of the bohai bay red zone and laizhou bay orange zone consist of several local eddies the materials are easily trapped within these eddies and are difficult to be exchanged with the outside except that in the northern part of the laizhou bay the provinces in the central basin and southeastern liaodong bay green and blue zone correspond to a counter clockwise circulation flowing outward through the bohai strait the province extending from the northwestern liaodong bay to the western boundary of the central basin purple zone corresponds to an evident transport pathway through the two areas and finally flowing outside of the bohai sea from the southern part of the bohai strait it is notable that the boundaries between adjacent provinces are basically parallel to the streamlines of lagrangian residual velocity over 15 tidal periods suggesting weak exchange between different provinces that is not the case for the eulerian residual velocity as its streamlines can cross the province boundaries especially for the provinces around the central basin purple green and blue zone fig 3 b although there are some eddy structures of erv in the coastal regions similar to that of lrv the patterns of erv and lrv in the central basin are distinctly different this suggests that erv is less ideal than lrv in describing the mass transport process wang et al 2013 in the weakly nonlinear bohai sea the degree and province of the lagrangian flow network match well with the pattern of the lagrangian residual velocity averaged over 15 tidal periods in other words the lagrangian residual velocity or the mass transport velocity provides hydrodynamical pathways and barriers of the lfn formation hence lfn and lrv can jointly characterize the tidal induced mass transport pattern however the time lengths taken to construct lfn and lrv are significantly different due to the evolution of the province structure in the bohai sea the lfn is stable after 1500 periods of m 2 and not affected by the initial tidal phase on the other hand it takes a much small number about 15 of tidal periods to calculate the lrv to explain the lfn in the bohai sea the reasons behind this discrepancy in time scales are discussed below the theoretical framework of the weakly nonlinear system puts a restriction on the time length to compute the lagrangian residual velocity in feng 1986 it was deduced that the spatial scale of tidal excursion over n tidal periods l c κ n l c should be an order of magnitude smaller than the horizontal basin scale l c this requires o n 1 which is equivalent to o n κ 2 according to the expression of n 1 n 1 κ thus the upper limit of the number of the averaging tidal periods is o κ 2 which has been pointed out by feng 1986 in the present study the results are in accordance with the earlier finding it is revealed in sections 4 1 and 4 2 the mass transport velocity can maintain its pattern within dozens of tidal periods while its magnitude decreases with the increasing number of tidal periods but on the other hand mtv can only be represented by lrv calculated over a larger number of tidal periods of about 15 for the influence of the initial phase to be negligible this puts the lower limit of averaging tidal periods as approximately o κ 1 for the lagrangian flow network the essential information is the connections between the nodes in shallow seas the magnitude of the lagrangian residual velocity is often a few cm s while the distances among the nodes are hundreds of km thus the connection time can be o 1000 m 2 tidal periods this is a much longer time scale than that required to define the lrv the lfn results of different node sizes are all bound in this timescale when the node s size is 10 km fig 2 and fig 3 and 20 km fig b 1 a fig b 1 b and fig b 2 a lfn shows stable topological structures over 1500 tidal periods when the node s size is 5 km fig b 1 c fig b 1 d and fig b 2 b it can be stabilized after about 1 000 tidal periods because more connections can be found in higher resolution than the lower resolution in the same time periods but the time for stabilization is still restricted by the time length to complete the basin scale transport through the lagrangian residual velocity under this concept the independence of the initial tidal phase on the lfn can be explained the dependence of the initial tidal phase of the connection status mainly exists when a small number of the tidal periods are considered but in this case the lfn cannot be obtained because the connection information is insufficient when the connection information is enough several thousand tidal periods elapse and the variation of lfn on the initial tidal phase can be ignored finally besides the advection by the current the water parcels in shallow seas can also be transported by sub grid dispersive processes represented as an effective diffusion and commonly modeled by the random walk in the present study the random walk is not considered during the lagrangian tracking but this may not significantly influence the results because advection is much stronger than the diffusion process in the tide dominant shallow bohai sea choosing the node size as 10 km also helps to reduce the influence of diffusion even if it is included because the fine structure revealed with a smaller node size of 5 km can be smoothed by the diffusion 5 conclusions the mass transport processes are important for the ocean environment in this study the characteristics of mass transport in the bohai sea are revealed by the lagrangian flow network and the lagrangian residual velocity derived from the solution of a numerical model fvcom the patterns of both lfn and lrv are compared and the suitable time lengths for them to represent mass transport are discussed the lagrangian flow network is established by calculating the degrees and hydrodynamic provinces the out degree and in degree describe the transport process features and hydrodynamic provinces characterize the mass transport patterns both the degrees and provinces have regional features in the central basin and three bays of the bohai sea and their patterns are both consistent with the lagrangian residual velocity it is proved theoretically that in the weakly nonlinear tidal system the second order approximation of the lagrangian residual velocity includes the influence of the initial phase which can be ignored with a larger number of averaging tidal periods on the other hand the magnitude of the mass transport velocity decreases with the increasing number of tidal periods in order to balance both requirements 15 tidal periods of m 2 are found to be appropriate to calculate lrv for the mass transport velocity in the bohai sea the lagrangian residual velocity calculated over 15 tidal periods averaging is used to interpret the mechanism of mass transport pattern revealed by the lagrangian flow network the interior structure of the provinces shows correspondence to the eddy structure of lrv and the province boundaries are consistent with the streamlines of lrv this means that the lagrangian flow network is determined by the lagrangian residual current by comparison the eulerian residual velocity does not express the mass transport well because its streamlines may cross the province boundaries in summary the characteristics of the lagrangian flow network and the lagrangian residual velocity can be combined to describe the mass transport pattern in tide dominant coastal seas and the lagrangian residual velocity is the dynamical mechanism for the lagrangian flow network pattern this may lay the foundation for using lagrangian flow network to analyze and quantify flow and transport pathways in shallow tide dominated coastal regions

major axis if ellipse b translates its center along ellipse a the inner and outer envelopes of the ellipse b are also ellipses with the same eccentricity and parallel semi major axis as ellipses a and b supposing that the ratio of the semi major axis lengths of ellipse b to a is m without loss of generality m 1 then the ratio of the semi major axis lengths of the inner and outer envelope to ellipse a are 1 m and 1 m respectively proof the equation of ellipse a the blue ellipse in fig a 1 is a 1 x 2 a 2 y 2 b 2 1 points on the ellipse a are expressed as acos θ bsin θ where θ 0 2 π is the parameter a and b are the semi major and the semi minor axis length of ellipse a the eccentricity of ellipse a is defined as e a 1 b 2 a 2 the equation of ellipse b the red ellipse in fig a 1 is a 2 x a cos θ 2 a 1 2 y b sin θ 2 b 1 2 1 where a 1 and b 1 are the semi major and the semi minor axis length of ellipse b the eccentricity of ellipse b is defined as e b 1 b 1 2 a 1 2 the equation of the envelopes of ellipse b can be expressed by f x y θ 0 and it should satisfy f x y θ θ 0 then the set of equations is a 3 x a cos θ 2 a 1 2 y b sin θ 2 b 1 2 1 0 a sin θ x a cos θ a 1 2 b cos θ y b sin θ b 1 2 0 supposing z 1 x a cos θ a 1 z 2 y b sin θ b 1 eq a 3 can be rewritten as a 4 z 1 2 z 2 2 1 z 1 a sin θ a 1 z 2 b cos θ b 1 it can be obtained from eq a 4 that z 1 2 1 1 β 2 tan 2 θ and z 2 2 β 2 tan 2 θ 1 β 2 tan 2 θ where β ab 1 ba 1 considering the definition of z 1 and z 2 the following relations can be found a 5 x a cos θ 2 a 1 2 1 1 β 2 tan 2 θ y b sin θ 2 b 1 2 β 2 tan 2 θ 1 β 2 tan 2 θ then x and y can be given as a 6 x a cos 2 θ β 2 sin 2 θ a 1 cos 2 θ β 2 sin 2 θ cos θ y b cos 2 θ β 2 sin 2 θ b 1 β cos 2 θ β 2 sin 2 θ sin θ because ellipses a and b are assumed to have equal eccentricity β ab 1 ba 1 1 can be obtained eq a 6 becomes a 7 x a a 1 cos θ y b b 1 sin θ supposing a 1 ma and b 1 mb without loss of generality m 1 then the equation of the inner envelope is a 8 x 2 1 m a 2 y 2 1 m b 2 1 and the equation of the outer envelope is a 9 x 2 1 m a 2 y 2 1 m b 2 1 hence both the inner and outer envelopes are ellipses with the same eccentricity as ellipses a and b the ratio of the semi major axis lengths of the inner and outer envelope to that of ellipse a is 1 m and 1 m respectively lemma 2 the centers of ellipses a and b in lemma 1 the point of tangency between ellipse b and its outer envelope are collinear proof in fig a 1 line y kx goes through point o the center of ellipse a and an arbitrary point c on ellipse a ellipse b is centered at point c and with the same orientation as ellipse a the intersection point between the line y kx and the ellipse s outer envelope is point d it will be proved below that d is the point of tangency between ellipse b and its outer envelope since point c is the intersection point of line y kx and ellipse a it can be expressed as a 10 x c ab b 2 a 2 k 2 y c kab b 2 a 2 k 2 and it can also be defined as a 11 x c a cos θ y c b sin θ where tan θ ka b and k tan θ 0 similarly the intersection point d between the line y kx and the outer envelope can be expressed as a 12 x d a a 1 cos θ y d b b 1 sin θ where tan θ k a a 1 b b 1 since β ab 1 ba 1 1 is assumed it can be deduced that tan θ k a a 1 b b 1 ka b it can be verified that x d y d satisfies eq a 2 which means that point d is also on the ellipse b now that point d is on the ellipse b and also on its outer envelope it is the point of tangency between the two so it is proved that the points o c and d are collinear next the two lemmas will be applied further to analyze the scale of the lagrangian drift ellipse over multi tidal periods under an ideal condition that a water parcel starts from one initial tidal phase and can continuously move for multiple periods while keeping the initial tidal phase of this water parcel constant the scale of the lagrangian drift ellipse starting from a fixed position can evolve as shown in fig a 2 the water parcel at the initial position with the initial phase θ 0 0 2 π can form a lagrangian drift ellipse ellipse a1 in fig a 2 with the spatial scale of κ 3 l c after one tidal period the center of ellipse a1 is obtained by translating the initial fixed position by l mtv net displacement of the mass transport velocity over one tidal period based on the derivation process of the lagrangian residual velocity mtv in the area with the scale of κ 3 l c is constant and accurate to the order of o κ 2 hence the water parcel on ellipse a1 will form an equal ellipse b1 the blue ellipse in fig a 2 after the motion during the second tidal period if only mtv is considered but when lrv is considered accurate to the second order the water parcels starting from ellipse a1 with different initial phases will form a set of ellipses a1 the red ellipses in fig a 2 are equal to ellipse a1 their centers are located on ellipse b1 after the motion over two tidal periods the spatial coverage of all the ellipses a1 is the range of ending position that the water parcel forms after continuous motion over two tidal periods based on lemma 1 the outer envelope of ellipse a1 is an ellipse that is parallel to ellipse a1 labeled as ellipse a2 the length of the semi major axis of the ellipse a2 is 2 κ 3 l c if the water parcels move further over another tidal period ellipse a3 can be formed as the outer envelope of a set of ellipses a2 equal to ellipse a1 for the same reason the length of the semi major axis of ellipse a3 is 3 κ 3 l c if after n tidal periods ellipse an parallel to ellipse a1 can be formed with the scale of its semi major axis length being n κ 3 l c the scale of the lagrangian drift velocity is equal to the scale of the lagrangian drift ellipse n κ 3 l c divided by tidal periods 2 π n i e κ 3 l c 2 π based on the expression of u ld u ld cos θ 0 u ld sin θ 0 the initial phase is the angle between the x axis i e the direction of the mass transport velocity and the line which connects each point on the ellipse a1 an with their centers assuming that a water parcel starting from one initial tidal phase continuously moves for multiple periods and supposing that the initial tidal phase of this water parcel can be constant on every n tidal period lagrangian drift ellipse then according to lemma 2 the ending position of the water parcel can always be located on the outer envelope so that the scale of the lagrangian drift ellipse can be kept n κ 3 l c to give an intuitive demonstration of the trend of the mass transport velocity and the lagrangian drift ellipse the results of a sverdrup wave feng et al 1986a are shown as an example in sections 4 1 and 4 2 the zeroth order velocity field with all the variables being dimensionless of the sverdrup wave can be expressed as a 13

23787,based on a numerical hydrodynamic model and lagrangian particle tracking method the lagrangian flow network and the lagrangian residual velocity were derived to exhibit the mass transport pattern in the tide dominant bohai sea the characteristics of the lagrangian flow network represented by degree and hydrodynamic provinces show distinct regional features in the central basin and the three bays the first order lagrangian residual velocity i e the mass transport velocity can be well maintained over a dozen averaging tidal periods with its magnitude slightly decreasing with the increasing number of tidal periods the second order lagrangian residual velocity i e the lagrangian drift velocity includes the dependence on the initial tidal phase which is also weakened with the increasing number of tidal periods the mechanism behind the above two features of the lagrangian residual velocity is explained theoretically in the bohai sea with about 15 averaging tidal periods the lagrangian residual velocity is approximately independent of the initial tidal phase and close to the mass transport velocity the streamlines of the lagrangian residual velocity averaged over 15 tidal periods are parallel to the province boundaries in the lagrangian flow network which means that the lagrangian flow network is determined by the lagrangian residual current this may lay the foundation for using lagrangian flow network to analyze and quantify flow and transport pathways in shallow tide dominated coastal regions keywords lagrangian flow network lagrangian residual velocity mass transport bohai sea data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction mass transport mainly caused by the advection and diffusion processes in the ocean is of primary importance when studying the offshore shallow sea environment briton et al 2018 mclachlan et al 2020 mitarai et al 2009 prants et al 2011 sunday et al 2014 it determines the spread of pollutants al muzaini 2013 nutrients hu et al 2008 and organisms gerber et al 2014 in the ocean and in certain circumstances it can be related to human activities halpern et al 2008 syvitski et al 2005 xu et al 2016 for example mass transport processes can regulate nutrient transport washburn and mcphee shaw 2013 and drive the motion of the planktons dambach et al 2016 to influence the marine ecosystem human activities such as land reclamation pelling et al 2013 and ocean engineering tang et al 2017 can change the flow field and the turbulent intensity to affect the mass transport processes in the ocean advection often makes the dominant contribution to mass transport bonhomme et al 2007 delhez 1996 wei et al 2016 advection determines the connections between different subregions in the study area which can be described by the concept of a flow network based on network theory newman 2003 phillips et al 2015 zou et al 2019 therein subregions can be represented by nodes in the flow network and the connections can be abstracted to the edges or links donner et al 2017 rossi et al 2014 in recent years the concept of the flow network has been applied in many oceanographic studies ranging from coastal pearson et al 2020 basin rossi et al 2014 to global scales froyland et al 2014 jönsson and watson 2016 particularly when the target matter floats with the current such as microplastics zambianchi et al 2017 fish larvae dubois et al 2016 or suspended sediment pearson et al 2020 the mass transport process can be studied by establishing the lagrangian flow network through the lagrangian particle tracking rossi et al 2016 the pattern of mass transport revealed in the flow network provides essential knowledge for marine management and environment improvement fujiwara et al 2017 ser giacomi et al 2015 2021b however the mechanism behind the pattern given by the flow network is not fully understood because of the dominant role played by the flow field one would expect that the flow network follows the current however the presence of multi temporal scales in the flow field makes it challenging to derive the representative current at a proper scale this issue may be less severe for the global or basin scales when the mass transport processes are mainly caused by relatively steady ocean currents jönsson and watson 2016 rossi et al 2014 the issue becomes more evident in the shallow sea environment with the presence of significant temporal variations because of tides buschman et al 2009 izquierdo and mikolajewicz 2019 yanagi and tamaru 1990 zhou et al 2020 zhu et al 2016 however even in coastal seas the structure of the flow network can be stable without evident temporal variations hence representing the long term mass transport patterns pearson et al 2020 yu et al 2021 these results reveal discrepancies between the temporal variated flow field and the stable flow network structure which has yet to be studied thus to explain the feature of the stable pattern of flow network in coastal seas this study aims to find the corresponding steady current without explicit tidal signals in the tide dominant shallow seas the concept of the residual current can be traced back to the 1960s abbott 1960 hunt 1961 the residual current is the average of the instantaneous current in a certain sense to remove the tidal signal the definitions of the residual current fall into two categories one is the lagrangian residual velocity defined as the net displacement of a water parcel over one or several tidal periods divided by the elapsed time e g feng et al 2008 the other is the eulerian residual velocity which is the average of the current at each fixed location e g wang et al 2013 many previous studies have found that the lagrangian residual velocity can represent the mass transport process in the inter tidal time scale while the eulerian residual velocity cannot cheng and casulli 1982 das et al 2000 feng et al 1986b guillou and chapalain 2017 longuet higgins 1969 defined the mass transport velocity according to the lagrangian residual velocity which is the sum of eulerian residual velocity and the stokes drift velocity for fluctuating large scale currents in follow on studies the mass transport velocity is proved to be the first order approximation of the lagrangian residual velocity under weakly nonlinear conditions for the 2d vertically averaged case feng et al 1986a and for the 3d case feng 1986 and in both cases the lagrangian residual velocity is extended to a second order approximation the second order term referred to as the lagrangian drift velocity varies with the initial tidal phase that is related to the release time of a water parcel in a tidal period this explains why the lagrangian residual velocity is influenced by the initial tidal phase as found in many studies dortch et al 1992 muller et al 2009 zimmerman 1979 because the flow network is generally steady in a tide dominant shallow sea its feature may be more related to the time invariant mass transport velocity in this study the bohai sea a typical tide dominant shallow sea located on the northwest coast of the pacific ocean e g bian et al 2016 sündermann and feng 2004 is selected to demonstrate the mass transport pattern presented by the lagrangian flow network and to reveal the mechanism from the perspective of the lagrangian residual velocity this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the concepts of the lagrangian flow network and the lagrangian residual velocity and describes the numerical method for acquiring them section 3 illustrates the characteristics of the lagrangian flow network and the lagrangian residual velocity in the bohai sea section 4 discusses the mechanism of the lagrangian flow network expressed by the lagrangian residual velocity and the long term mass transport pattern section 5 gives the conclusions of this study 2 theory and methods 2 1 construction of the lagrangian flow network according to the network theory the essential elements in a network are nodes edges and topology newman 2003 nodes are basic units and subregions in the flow field edges represent the connections among the nodes i e the connectivity between different subregions of the fluid area in the network edges can be directed or undirected and they can also be weighted depending on the connectivity in the fluid if a water parcel in subregion a can move to subregion b following the current this corresponds to a directed edge from subregion a to b and its weight can be defined as the time of water parcel movement edges can be calculated by the lagrangian particle tracking method in such a case the nodes and the derived edges form the lagrangian flow network lfn the network s topology is demonstrated by certain characteristic parameters calculated from the nodes and edges fujiwara et al 2017 rossi et al 2016 which can reveal the key regions and processes for mass transport ser giacomi et al 2015 2 1 1 nodes of the lagrangian flow network when dividing the study area into subregions to form the lfn nodes the primary determining factor is the spatial scale of subregions this relies on understanding the dominant hydrodynamics in the study area in reality multi scale hydrodynamic processes in the ocean usually consist of one dominant process characterizing the large scale and slow varying motions and others characterizing small scale and high frequency motions the spatial scale of each node should be small enough so that the dominant hydrodynamical process can be identified while large enough to smooth out the small scale motions the first requirement means that the size of each node should be at least one order smaller than the spatial scale of the dominant hydrodynamical process the second requirement defines the lower limit of the scale of a node which is in the same order as the scale of the small scale motions the final output is an lfn formulated with m nodes obtained by dividing the study area into m subregions with a specific appropriate spatial resolution 2 1 2 edges of the lagrangian flow network in lfn edges can be defined as a matrix based on the connection conditions among different nodes here the connection between two nodes means that the water parcel in one node can move to another node in a fixed length of time t n under different connection conditions different types of edges can be defined phillips et al 2015 if a water parcel in node i flows to node j over t n this refers to a directional connection from i to j and a directed edge d i j 1 in lfn where i and j are the starting and ending nodes respectively if over t n no water parcel in node i can flow to node j then d i j is set to 0 edge d i j indicates whether the connection between node i and node j exists but does not include the extent of the connection thus d i j i j denotes the directed and unweighted edges in lfn in a node pair i j d i j 1 means that there are water parcels moving from node i to node j over t n while the time taken for different water parcels may differ the shortest time taken denoted as e i j represents the minimum connecting time from node i to node j if d i j 0 i e no connection exists between node i and node j over t n e i j is set to 0 edge e i j defined by the minimum connecting time embodies a kind of connection extent between nodes i and j the established e i j i j denotes the directed and weighted edges in lfn if the connection direction is not considered the undirected and weighted edges w i j i j can be defined as 1 w i j min e i j e j i e i j e j i 0 max e i j e j i e i j e j i 0 and e i j e j i 0 0 e i j e j i 0 that is w i j 0 if there is no edge between node i and node j w i j 0 is set to the non zero value e i j or e j i if there is an edge in one direction only i e either e i j 0 e j i 0 or e i j 0 e j i 0 and w i j is set to the minimum of e i j and e j i if edges of both directions between node i and node j exist determining the connection between nodes is the key procedure to find the different kinds of edges the detailed procedure to get the directed and weighted edges e i j was described in our previous research yu et al 2021 firstly the particles are placed uniformly in the study area with the spatial resolution of the initial positions of the particles being at least one order of magnitude smaller than the scale of the nodes then the positions of the particles are updated by calculating their trajectories following the flow field passively over a certain time interval with the trajectories of particles at different time instances recorded finally the above defined edges can be obtained by analyzing the trajectories of the particles 2 1 3 topology of the lagrangian flow network based on the information on nodes and edges the topological structure of lfn can be established which portrays additional connection relationships besides edges it can be used to identify the dynamical barriers or the corridors and to discuss the transport pattern in the flow field ser giacomi et al 2021a the expression of the topological structure relies on the quantitative characteristic parameters of the network in this study two parameters namely the degree and province are selected to represent the topological structure of lfn they are calculated by edges and node pairs and are used to obtain a general and stable mass transport pattern in the bohai sea specifically the degree is defined as the number of edges pointing out of a particular node i e out degree or pointing into this node i e in degree newman 2010 ser giacomi et al 2015 2017 hence the out degree of node i equals to j d i j and the in degree of node i equals to j d j i the values of out degree and in degree quantitatively display the output and input transport dominated by the advection by current over time the hydrodynamic province in the flow network is the cluster of nodes the nodes in the same province are well connected among themselves while most of them do not connect with other nodes outside the province phillips et al 2015 boundaries between provinces have been proven to coincide with oceanographic features in previous studies and have been used to identify the flow barriers for domain connectivity and to design marine reserves for larval dispersion rossi et al 2014 reijnders et al 2020 the hydrodynamic province a comprehensive result of fluid movement over a certain length of time can describe the pattern of long term mass transport 2 2 theory of the lagrangian residual velocity the lagrangian residual velocity lrv is formulated to represent the steady current in the tide dominated shallow sea after filtering out the tidal oscillation in the following the first order and second order approximations of lrv are introduced briefly in the following discussion the variables are dimensionless except noted specifically in the weakly nonlinear tidal system the shallow water long wave equation can describe the water motion which is nondimensionalized by the tidal period and wavelength or the horizontal basin scale then according to the dimensionless shallow water long wave equation and continuity equation a nonlinearity parameter κ is defined as 2 κ ζ c h c l c l c where ζ c is the characteristic tidal amplitude h c is the characteristic basin depth l c is the tidal excursion scale in one tidal period and l c is the horizontal scale of the basin or the tidal wavelength the tidal velocity u can be expanded by using the perturbation technique as 3 u x θ u 0 x θ κ u 1 x θ o κ 2 where x represents the spatial position θ denotes time which is related to the tidal phase u 0 is the zeroth order tidal velocity and u 1 is the first order tidal velocity the tidal averaging operator is introduced as follows 4 f 1 2 π n θ 0 θ 0 2 π n f d θ where f is the averaged variable n is the number of the averaging tidal periods and θ 0 is the initial tidal phase 5 u 0 u 0 cos θ u 0 sin θ 6 u 1 u 1 cos 2 θ u 1 sin 2 θ u er where u 0 u 0 u 1 and u 1 vary only with space and u er is the eulerian residual velocity erv at the initial position x 0 defined by 7 u er x 0 u x 0 θ u 1 x 0 θ o κ according to the definition of the lagrangian residual velocity feng et al 2008 the lrv u lr can be expressed as 8 u lr u x θ where x x 0 κ n ξ is the water parcel s trajectory in n tidal periods ξ is the lagrangian displacement of the water parcel represented by 9 n ξ θ 0 θ u x 0 κ n ξ θ d θ where n 1 n 1 κ represents the ratio between the tidal excursion of n tidal periods and one period feng 1986 if n is chosen to be smaller than o κ 1 to keep o n 1 the tidal velocity u can have a taylor expansion at x 0 substitute this taylor expansion into the perturbation form of u x θ in eq 3 to have 10 u x θ u 0 x 0 θ κ u 1 x 0 θ κ n ξ 0 θ x 0 θ 0 u 0 x x 0 o κ 2 the lrv from different orders of approximation can be obtained by substituting eq 10 into eq 8 the first and second order approximations of lrv are given below 2 2 1 the first order approximation of the lagrangian residual velocity the first order approximation of the lagrangian residual velocity is called the mass transport velocity mtv which can be expressed as 11 u mt u er u sd u sd is called the stokes drift velocity sdv which is expressed as 12 u sd n ξ 0 u 0 where the zeroth order lagrangian displacement is 13 n ξ 0 θ 0 θ u 0 x 0 θ d θ eqs 7 and 12 show that u er and u sd and hence the mass transport velocity are not affected by the initial tidal phase but they may depend on the number of the averaging tidal periods the impacts of tidal periods on lrv will be described in the results section and the underlying mechanism will be explored in the discussions section in addition the eulerian residual velocity is proven not to satisfy the conservation equation for a material surface thus leading to a break in the continuity of the flow field hence that it cannot be used to express mass transport process feng et al 2008 the pattern of erv will be presented in the discussions section where the limitation of erv on the mass transport process will be discussed briefly 2 2 2 the second order approximation of the lagrangian residual velocity the lagrangian residual velocity perturbation can be further expanded to the second order to get 14 u lr u mt κ u ld o κ 2 where u ld is lagrangian drift velocity ldv that includes the influence of the initial phase on lrv the ldv was deduced by feng et al 1986a and is expressed by 15 u ld u ld cos θ 0 u ld sin θ 0 where 16 u ld u 0 u mt u mt u 0 and u ld u 0 u mt u mt u 0 represent the interaction of the tidal current and mtv if the water parcel with the initial phase θ 0 0 2 π is tracked over one tidal period the end position of the water parcel can form an ellipse that is called the lagrangian drift ellipse the magnitude of the lagrangian drift velocity can be estimated by dividing the length of the semi major axis of the lagrangian drift ellipse by the tidal period based on the second order approximation of the lagrangian residual velocity the lagrangian drift velocity is one order of magnitude smaller than the mass transport velocity and the spatial scale of the lagrangian drift ellipse of one tidal period is κ 3 l c the conceptual diagram of lrv with different orders of approximation can be found in fig 1 of feng et al 1986a it shows the interrelations among the lagrangian residual velocity the mass transport velocity the eulerian residual velocity the stokes drift velocity the lagrangian drift velocity and the lagrangian drift ellipse the influence of the initial phase on the lagrangian residual velocity will vary with the number of tidal periods the impacts of the initial phase and tidal periods on the second order lrv will be presented and discussed in the results and discussions sections 2 3 numerical model 2 3 1 hydrodynamic model configuration the finite volume community ocean model fvcom chen et al 2006 was used to simulate the tidal hydrodynamics in the whole bohai sea and the north yellow sea fig 1 the model fits the shoreline well by adopting the varying spatial resolution from 5 000 m offshore to 200 m nearshore achieved via using the unstructured triangular mesh and the number of vertical sigma layers is 5 the horizontal and vertical mixing parameterizations adopt the smagorinsky eddy parameterization scheme and mellor and yamada level 2 5 turbulence closure model respectively the quadratic bottom friction is applied and the bottom roughness coefficient is set as 0 001 the external and internal time steps are set as 1 s and 10 s for mode splitting the hydrodynamic model is run for 60 periods of m 2 tide with the imposed open boundary condition of single frequency tide m 2 the details of the model configuration and validation can be found in yu et al 2021 in this study only the surface velocity field is used to calculate the particle trajectories to obtain the lagrangian flow network and the lagrangian residual velocity this is because on the one hand barotropic processes dominate the tidal current in the bohai sea whose characteristics can be well represented by the sea surface velocity on the other hand the lagrangian flow network is mainly used to represent the motion of buoyant particles that are transported at the surface such as the microplastics 2 3 2 the lagrangian particle tracking method the fourth order runge kutta scheme is applied to calculate the particle trajectories at the surface of the bohai sea without including the effects of random walking in the case that a particle arrives at the land boundary it will be removed at the next time step more than 70 000 particles are initially released with a spatial resolution of 1 km in the bohai sea the time step for the lagrangian particle tracking is 12 min and the integration time lasts from 1 to 60 tidal periods in different experiments the particle tracking results are used to analyze the influence of the initial phase and integration time on the lagrangian residual velocity in addition the particle trajectories are traced for 1 800 tidal periods by reusing the simulated 60 tidal periods flow field to construct the lagrangian flow network this ensures the relatively stable structure of the lagrangian flow network 2 3 3 the lagrangian flow network construction in the bohai sea several temporally and spatially varying dynamic factors exist such as the river input wind stress and stratification but the tide is the dominant and permanent dynamic factor the spatial scale of the tide excursion is 10 km therefore 10 km is selected as the spatial resolution for the division of subregions nodes and this results in a lagrangian flow network consisting of a total of 749 nodes to show the impacts of the node s size on lfn two experiments with node sizes of 20 km and 5 km are carried out with the results presented and analyzed in the results and discussions sections in addition the seeding resolution of 1 km is suitable for the acquisition of edges such a seeding resolution is one order of magnitude smaller than the node s size of 10 km thus can resolve the connection relationship through the connecting time between nodes and prove the good applicable ability of the lagrangian flow network rossi et al 2014 ser giacomi et al 2017 based on particle trajectories over 1 800 tidal periods the minimum connecting time between pairs of nodes is counted in the number of m 2 tidal periods to establish the edges e i j i j in the bohai sea the directed unweighted edges d i j i j and undirected weighted edges w i j i j are extracted to calculate the topological structure the out degree and in degree are calculated through d i j i j by their definition the acquisition of the province in the network can be accomplished via a variety of algorithms therein modularity is a parameter that can quantitatively evaluate the results of province partition whose definition is the sum of the weight of edges inside the provinces minus the sum of the weight of edges in the stochastic cases expressed by 17 q 1 2 m i j a i j k i k j 2 m δ c i c j where q represents modularity a i j is the weight of the edge from node i to node j m 1 2 i j a i j represents the sum of the weight of all edges k i j a i j represents the sum of the weight of edges from node i to all nodes k i k j 2 m represents the probability that node i and node j can be connected and δ c i c j 1 c i c j 0 c i c j with c i being the province that node i belongs to in this study the louvain algorithm whose principle is the modularity maximization newman and girvan 2004 blondel et al 2008 is applied for hydrodynamic province calculation through the input variable w i j i j lequeux et al 2018 the louvain algorithm for hydrodynamic province calculation is implemented by a library called louvain in python traag and bruggeman 2009 2 3 4 the lagrangian residual velocity calculation the lagrangian residual velocity is defined as the net displacement of a water parcel over one or several tidal periods divided by the elapsed time as presented by eq 8 the lrv is derived using the trajectories of particles with 1 km seeding resolution although the spatial resolution of the hydrodynamic model ranges from 5 000 m offshore to 200 m nearshore the areas with a spatial resolution from 200 m to 1 km are mainly located near the shoreline while in most study areas the spatial resolution of the model is larger than 1 km therefore we expect that setting the seeding resolution smaller than 1 km will not change the pattern of lrv lrvs with different initial tidal phases and the number of tidal periods driven by the single frequency tide are calculated separately the first order approximation of lrv i e the mass transport velocity is calculated by averaging the lrvs with different initial phases according to the form of the lagrangian drift velocity revealed in eq 15 ldv is obtained by calculating the difference between lrvs with different initial phases and mtv the integration time of lrv ranges from 1 period of m 2 12 42 h to 60 periods meanwhile 12 initial phases with 1 hour intervals apart denoted as phase 01 to phase 12 that represent 0 to 11 h after a certain starting time t 0 are also selected to analyze the influence of the initial phase on lrv 3 results 3 1 characteristics of the lagrangian flow network in the bohai sea the lagrangian flow network of the bohai sea is constructed two other characteristics i e degree and hydrodynamic provinces are obtained and their topological structures are stabilized after simulations over 1500 tidal periods thus the results presented below are the lagrangian flow network structures based on particle trajectories over 1500 tidal periods 3 1 1 distribution of degrees the degree of the lagrangian flow network based on the directed unweighted edges d i j i j is shown in fig 2 the out degree and in degree show different regional features the out degree presents high values in the liaodong bay and much smaller values in the central basin and the other two bays fig 2 a the in degree shows much higher values around the central basin i e near the entrances to the bohai bay and laizhou bay and the southern part of the bohai strait and relatively smaller values elsewhere fig 2 b the distributions of out degree and in degree calculated with node sizes of 20 km and 5 km are presented by fig b 1 in appendix b respectively the main regional features of the distributions are consistent with that shown in fig 2 hence the following analyses of the mass transport process will be based on the results using a 10 km node size based on the definition of the degree the regions with larger values of the out degree are where particles tend to leave following the current thus according to fig 2 a materials in the liaodong bay are more likely to be transported to other areas conversely the nodes with higher in degree values tend to receive material from a greater diversity of source nodes according to fig 2 b there is a continuous transport pathway going around the western and southern boundaries of the central basin and reaching the southern part of the bohai strait the transport of materials from the bohai sea to the outside area yellow sea through the southern part of the bohai strait is consistent with the results of earlier studies e g guan 1994 3 1 2 hydrodynamic provinces by applying the louvain algorithm five hydrodynamic provinces emerge naturally to divide the whole bohai sea as shown by different colors in fig 3 among them the bohai bay is a single province red zone the laizhou bay and the southern central basin form another province orange zone and the liaodong bay and central basin form three provinces blue green and purple zones from east to west the hydrodynamic provinces obtained with node sizes of 20 km and 5 km are shown in fig b 2 in appendix b the overall distributions are similar to that based on a node size of 10 km the case of 20 km node size still gets five provinces while the case of 5 km node size obtains ten provinces showing more detailed regional variation the following analysis will continue based on the results of the 10 km node size to quantitatively assess the partition quality of hydrodynamic provinces we count the number of undirected edges inside each province and between different provinces and the results are summarized in table 1 the total number of undirected edges in the bohai sea is 42244 74 of the number of all the edges is inside each province this suggests that the water parcels connect with each other closely inside each province which quantitatively illustrates a good performance of the partition by hydrodynamic provinces the locations and separation of hydrodynamic provinces fig 3 show correspondence to the distribution of degrees fig 2 the provinces of the bohai bay and laizhou bay red and orange zones both have small values of out degree and in degree indicating that their low exchange with other areas provinces the provinces located in the central basin and southeastern liaodong bay green and blue zones also have small out degree and in degree values the province extending from the head of the liaodong bay to the western and southern boundaries of the central basin purple zone presents the transition from areas with high out degree values in the north to high in degree values in the south this pattern of degree structure depicts an evident pathway for material transport i e running from the liaodong bay along the western coast around the western and southern boundaries of the central basin and finally exiting the bohai sea through the southern part of the bohai strait 3 2 characteristics of the lagrangian residual velocity the lagrangian residual velocity induced by the m 2 the dominant tidal constituent in the bohai sea is discussed below according to the theoretical results summarized in section 2 2 the lrv at a specific location is influenced by the initial phase and the number of tracking tidal periods 3 2 1 spatial pattern and magnitude of the mass transport velocity as the first order approximation of the lagrangian residual velocity the mass transport velocity over one tidal period is calculated with its magnitude filled color and pattern white curves presented in fig 4 in the bohai sea the magnitude of mtv is greater than 2 cm s near most coastal areas and decreases toward the interior the minimum magnitude of smaller than 0 5 cm s occurs in the central basin mtv shows a general counter clockwise circulation in the bohai sea starting from the liaodong bay going through the central basin and the northeastern laizhou bay and finally flowing out through the bohai strait there are several localized eddies in the three bays including the counter clockwise eddies in the northern and eastern liaodong bay clockwise eddies in the northern and southern bohai bay counter clockwise eddy in the western bohai bay and a clockwise eddy in the laizhou bay in the bohai strait mtv points inward in the north and directs outward in the south fig 5 a shows that the magnitude of the mass transport velocity induced by the m 2 tide in the whole bohai sea decreases with the increasing number of tidal periods specifically the area averaged mtv is 0 9 cm s for one period and 0 5 cm s for 60 periods the magnitude of the mass transport velocity also varies with the value of the nonlinearity parameter κ defined by eq 2 the spatial distribution of κ is shown in fig 5 b calculated by taking ζ c the characteristic value of the tidal elevation as the monthly mean of tidal amplitude it can be seen that κ is smaller than 0 05 in most areas of the bohai sea and can be larger than 0 1 only in coastal areas fig 5 c shows the variations of the magnitude of mtv averaged over areas with different ranges of the values of κ as functions of the tidal period the magnitude of mtv is smaller for smaller values of κ for instance the magnitude of mtv for one tidal period is about 0 8 cm s for areas with κ 0 10 and 0 5 cm s for areas with κ 0 01 furthermore the magnitude of mtv decreases slower with the tidal periods for smaller values of κ for example the mtv magnitude for 60 tidal periods is 60 of that for one tidal period for κ 0 10 while 80 for κ 0 01 the dependence of the mass transport velocity on the number of averaging tidal periods is illustrated in fig 6 the magnitude of mtv shows evident reduction with the increasing number of tidal periods in the coastal areas where the nonlinearity is stronger consistent with the dependence on different ranges of κ values shown in fig 5 c on the other hand the patterns of mtv show an evident variation with the averaging tidal periods e g the main counter clockwise pattern in the whole bohai sea is maintained for tidal periods of 15 30 45 and 60 hence the number of averaging tidal periods mainly affects the magnitude rather than the pattern of mtv 3 2 2 spatial pattern of the lagrangian residual velocity and the influence of initial tidal phases if approximated to the second order the lagrangian residual velocity can be affected by the initial phase fig 7 presents the lrv averaged over one tidal period from initial phases of 01 04 07 and 10 corresponding to the initial time of 0 3 6 and 9 h after t 0 the magnitudes and patterns for the four phases are fairly similar close to that of the mass transport velocity shown in fig 4 only the streamlines of lrv in the central basin are slightly different the weak influence of the initial tidal phase on lrv is related to the weak nonlinearity of the bohai sea the dependence of the second order lagrangian residual velocity i e the lagrangian drift velocity on the averaging tidal periods is shown in fig 8 a similar to the mass transport velocity fig 5 c the ldv magnitude decreases with the increasing number of tidal periods and the decreasing rate is lower for smaller κ values fig 8 b shows the magnitude ratio of ldv to mtv with the increasing number of tidal periods the ldv mtv decreases in the same way as mtv does this suggests that the influence of the initial phase on lrv included in ldv becomes weaker with the increasing number of tidal periods and with decreasing strength of nonlinearity represented by the κ values next we calculate the correlation coefficients between u 1 v 1 and u 2 v 2 the fields of the lagrangian residual velocity and mass transport velocity in the whole bohai sea respectively the correlations are computed for the eastward and northward components denoted as corr u 1 u 2 and corr v 1 v 2 respectively and for u 1 v 1 of different initial phases 01 12 corresponding to 0 11 h after t 0 fig 9 shows the correlations with the different numbers of averaging tidal periods the correlation coefficients of both u and v components rise rapidly with the number of tidal periods increasing from 1 to 10 and then rise gradually from 10 to 60 tidal periods the difference among correlations for lrv of different initial phases is larger for smaller numbers of tidal periods and becomes smaller with the increasing number of tidal periods considering that both mtv and the influence of the initial phase on lrv decrease with the increasing number of tidal periods we suggest that the mass transport process in the bohai sea can be represented by lrv averaged over 15 tidal periods which is approximately equal to mtv and is not significantly affected by the initial tidal phase 4 discussions 4 1 decrease of the magnitude of mass transport velocity with the increasing number of averaging tidal periods to discuss the dependence of the magnitude of the mass transport velocity on the number of tidal periods ξ ij is used to denote the net displacement of a water parcel from the end of the i th tidal period to the end of the j th tidal period in reality the tidal current varies in space thus ξ ij for adjacent i j pairs are not always in the same direction to form a straight line rather considering the first two adjacent tidal cycles the initial position and the two ending positions most likely form a triangle i e ξ 02 ξ 01 ξ 12 for n tidal periods the net displacement from the initial to the end of the n th tidal cycle should satisfy 18 ξ 0 n ξ 01 ξ 12 ξ n 1 n since the mass transport velocity is the net displacement divided by the tidal periods mtv averaged over multiple tidal periods should be generally smaller than that over one tidal period this can be demonstrated using the example of a sverdrup wave following feng et al 1986a its zeroth order velocity field is given in eq a 13 in appendix a based on eq 10 the lagrangian residual velocity is calculated for different initial phases of θ 0 π 6 π 3 2 π different nonlinearity parameter values of κ 0 05 0 10 and 0 20 over one to 3200 tidal periods fig 10 presents the results with f 0 4 and the initial position of the water parcel x 0 y 0 0 0 the magnitudes of the mass transport velocity show fluctuating trends with the number of tidal periods the fluctuations become weaker with the increase of the number of tidal periods and become steady for a smaller number of tidal periods with increasing value of κ note that this special case of a sverdrup wave includes no viscosity over an infinite space in reality the presence of viscosity leads to a faster decrease in the magnitude of the mass transport velocity with the increasing number of tidal periods and particle tracking cannot be carried out over a large number of tidal periods because the water parcel can hit the shoreline thus only the first decreasing phase in fig 10 applies to the real ocean situation also according to fig 10 the stronger nonlinearity cases exhibit a faster decrease of the mass transport velocity with the increasing number of tidal periods in the bohai sea the nonlinearity is weak and the mass transport velocity decreases slowly and becomes steady over a dozen tidal periods 4 2 dependence of the lagrangian residual velocity on the initial tidal phase in the bohai sea the lagrangian drift velocity the second order lagrangian residual velocity gradually decreases with the increasing number of the averaging tidal periods and shows a weak dependence on the initial tidal phase the underlying reason is now explored under the idealized condition that the mass transport velocity and lagrangian drift velocity are constant over any tidal period the scale of lagrangian drift ellipse over multi tidal periods is analyzed first for a water parcel starting from an initial tidal phase during its continuous movement in the tidal flow its ending position after n tidal periods will be located on the lagrangian drift ellipse with a scale of n κ 3 l c according to appendix a in the real sea the continuous movement of a water parcel may experience changes in the mass transport velocity and lagrangian drift velocity due to the spatial variations of the magnitude of the tidal current in this case the ending position of the water parcel after n tidal periods cannot always be located at the outer envelope of the lagrangian drift ellipse the scale of the lagrangian drift ellipse is smaller than n κ 3 l c the magnitude of ldv will decrease with the increasing number of tidal periods and the influence of the initial phase is weakened thus the lrv is closer to mtv if the tracking of the water parcels covers more tidal periods in the bohai sea mtv can be regarded as a good approximation to lrv after 15 tidal periods taking a sverdrup wave as an example section 4 1 appendix a the ratio of the lagrangian drift velocity to the mass transport velocity for κ 0 05 0 10 and 0 20 are calculated as a measure of the influence of the initial phase on the lagrangian residual velocity as shown in fig 11 the ratio of ldv to mtv shows a fluctuant while decreasing behavior with the increasing number of tidal periods evidencing that the influence of the initial phase on ldv is gradually becoming smaller the ratio and the influence of the initial phase are smaller for smaller κ weaker nonlinearity the results for the idealized case of a sverdrup wave are consistent with that in the bohai sea 4 3 relationship between the lagrangian flow network and the lagrangian residual velocity fig 2 and fig 3 a depict the streamlines of the lagrangian residual velocity averaged over 15 tidal periods the pattern of the lagrangian residual velocity can explain the distributions of the out degree and in degree shown in fig 2 the values of the out degree and in degree are both relatively small in the bohai bay and laizhou bay and this is related to the local eddies in these areas the streamlines of the lrv show a large scale structure that starts from the liaodong bay then turns counter clockwise and finally flows outward this corresponds to high values of the out degree to the north of the central basin and high values of the in degree to the south the high values of in degree in the southern part of the bohai strait correspond to the eastern streamlines outward of the bohai sea the lagrangian residual velocity averaged over 15 tidal periods can also help to interpret the mass transport pattern revealed by the results of the hydrodynamic province as shown in fig 3 a the lrv streamlines in an individual province are coherent and structured provinces of the bohai bay red zone and laizhou bay orange zone consist of several local eddies the materials are easily trapped within these eddies and are difficult to be exchanged with the outside except that in the northern part of the laizhou bay the provinces in the central basin and southeastern liaodong bay green and blue zone correspond to a counter clockwise circulation flowing outward through the bohai strait the province extending from the northwestern liaodong bay to the western boundary of the central basin purple zone corresponds to an evident transport pathway through the two areas and finally flowing outside of the bohai sea from the southern part of the bohai strait it is notable that the boundaries between adjacent provinces are basically parallel to the streamlines of lagrangian residual velocity over 15 tidal periods suggesting weak exchange between different provinces that is not the case for the eulerian residual velocity as its streamlines can cross the province boundaries especially for the provinces around the central basin purple green and blue zone fig 3 b although there are some eddy structures of erv in the coastal regions similar to that of lrv the patterns of erv and lrv in the central basin are distinctly different this suggests that erv is less ideal than lrv in describing the mass transport process wang et al 2013 in the weakly nonlinear bohai sea the degree and province of the lagrangian flow network match well with the pattern of the lagrangian residual velocity averaged over 15 tidal periods in other words the lagrangian residual velocity or the mass transport velocity provides hydrodynamical pathways and barriers of the lfn formation hence lfn and lrv can jointly characterize the tidal induced mass transport pattern however the time lengths taken to construct lfn and lrv are significantly different due to the evolution of the province structure in the bohai sea the lfn is stable after 1500 periods of m 2 and not affected by the initial tidal phase on the other hand it takes a much small number about 15 of tidal periods to calculate the lrv to explain the lfn in the bohai sea the reasons behind this discrepancy in time scales are discussed below the theoretical framework of the weakly nonlinear system puts a restriction on the time length to compute the lagrangian residual velocity in feng 1986 it was deduced that the spatial scale of tidal excursion over n tidal periods l c κ n l c should be an order of magnitude smaller than the horizontal basin scale l c this requires o n 1 which is equivalent to o n κ 2 according to the expression of n 1 n 1 κ thus the upper limit of the number of the averaging tidal periods is o κ 2 which has been pointed out by feng 1986 in the present study the results are in accordance with the earlier finding it is revealed in sections 4 1 and 4 2 the mass transport velocity can maintain its pattern within dozens of tidal periods while its magnitude decreases with the increasing number of tidal periods but on the other hand mtv can only be represented by lrv calculated over a larger number of tidal periods of about 15 for the influence of the initial phase to be negligible this puts the lower limit of averaging tidal periods as approximately o κ 1 for the lagrangian flow network the essential information is the connections between the nodes in shallow seas the magnitude of the lagrangian residual velocity is often a few cm s while the distances among the nodes are hundreds of km thus the connection time can be o 1000 m 2 tidal periods this is a much longer time scale than that required to define the lrv the lfn results of different node sizes are all bound in this timescale when the node s size is 10 km fig 2 and fig 3 and 20 km fig b 1 a fig b 1 b and fig b 2 a lfn shows stable topological structures over 1500 tidal periods when the node s size is 5 km fig b 1 c fig b 1 d and fig b 2 b it can be stabilized after about 1 000 tidal periods because more connections can be found in higher resolution than the lower resolution in the same time periods but the time for stabilization is still restricted by the time length to complete the basin scale transport through the lagrangian residual velocity under this concept the independence of the initial tidal phase on the lfn can be explained the dependence of the initial tidal phase of the connection status mainly exists when a small number of the tidal periods are considered but in this case the lfn cannot be obtained because the connection information is insufficient when the connection information is enough several thousand tidal periods elapse and the variation of lfn on the initial tidal phase can be ignored finally besides the advection by the current the water parcels in shallow seas can also be transported by sub grid dispersive processes represented as an effective diffusion and commonly modeled by the random walk in the present study the random walk is not considered during the lagrangian tracking but this may not significantly influence the results because advection is much stronger than the diffusion process in the tide dominant shallow bohai sea choosing the node size as 10 km also helps to reduce the influence of diffusion even if it is included because the fine structure revealed with a smaller node size of 5 km can be smoothed by the diffusion 5 conclusions the mass transport processes are important for the ocean environment in this study the characteristics of mass transport in the bohai sea are revealed by the lagrangian flow network and the lagrangian residual velocity derived from the solution of a numerical model fvcom the patterns of both lfn and lrv are compared and the suitable time lengths for them to represent mass transport are discussed the lagrangian flow network is established by calculating the degrees and hydrodynamic provinces the out degree and in degree describe the transport process features and hydrodynamic provinces characterize the mass transport patterns both the degrees and provinces have regional features in the central basin and three bays of the bohai sea and their patterns are both consistent with the lagrangian residual velocity it is proved theoretically that in the weakly nonlinear tidal system the second order approximation of the lagrangian residual velocity includes the influence of the initial phase which can be ignored with a larger number of averaging tidal periods on the other hand the magnitude of the mass transport velocity decreases with the increasing number of tidal periods in order to balance both requirements 15 tidal periods of m 2 are found to be appropriate to calculate lrv for the mass transport velocity in the bohai sea the lagrangian residual velocity calculated over 15 tidal periods averaging is used to interpret the mechanism of mass transport pattern revealed by the lagrangian flow network the interior structure of the provinces shows correspondence to the eddy structure of lrv and the province boundaries are consistent with the streamlines of lrv this means that the lagrangian flow network is determined by the lagrangian residual current by comparison the eulerian residual velocity does not express the mass transport well because its streamlines may cross the province boundaries in summary the characteristics of the lagrangian flow network and the lagrangian residual velocity can be combined to describe the mass transport pattern in tide dominant coastal seas and the lagrangian residual velocity is the dynamical mechanism for the lagrangian flow network pattern this may lay the foundation for using lagrangian flow network to analyze and quantify flow and transport pathways in shallow tide dominated coastal regions

major axis if ellipse b translates its center along ellipse a the inner and outer envelopes of the ellipse b are also ellipses with the same eccentricity and parallel semi major axis as ellipses a and b supposing that the ratio of the semi major axis lengths of ellipse b to a is m without loss of generality m 1 then the ratio of the semi major axis lengths of the inner and outer envelope to ellipse a are 1 m and 1 m respectively proof the equation of ellipse a the blue ellipse in fig a 1 is a 1 x 2 a 2 y 2 b 2 1 points on the ellipse a are expressed as acos θ bsin θ where θ 0 2 π is the parameter a and b are the semi major and the semi minor axis length of ellipse a the eccentricity of ellipse a is defined as e a 1 b 2 a 2 the equation of ellipse b the red ellipse in fig a 1 is a 2 x a cos θ 2 a 1 2 y b sin θ 2 b 1 2 1 where a 1 and b 1 are the semi major and the semi minor axis length of ellipse b the eccentricity of ellipse b is defined as e b 1 b 1 2 a 1 2 the equation of the envelopes of ellipse b can be expressed by f x y θ 0 and it should satisfy f x y θ θ 0 then the set of equations is a 3 x a cos θ 2 a 1 2 y b sin θ 2 b 1 2 1 0 a sin θ x a cos θ a 1 2 b cos θ y b sin θ b 1 2 0 supposing z 1 x a cos θ a 1 z 2 y b sin θ b 1 eq a 3 can be rewritten as a 4 z 1 2 z 2 2 1 z 1 a sin θ a 1 z 2 b cos θ b 1 it can be obtained from eq a 4 that z 1 2 1 1 β 2 tan 2 θ and z 2 2 β 2 tan 2 θ 1 β 2 tan 2 θ where β ab 1 ba 1 considering the definition of z 1 and z 2 the following relations can be found a 5 x a cos θ 2 a 1 2 1 1 β 2 tan 2 θ y b sin θ 2 b 1 2 β 2 tan 2 θ 1 β 2 tan 2 θ then x and y can be given as a 6 x a cos 2 θ β 2 sin 2 θ a 1 cos 2 θ β 2 sin 2 θ cos θ y b cos 2 θ β 2 sin 2 θ b 1 β cos 2 θ β 2 sin 2 θ sin θ because ellipses a and b are assumed to have equal eccentricity β ab 1 ba 1 1 can be obtained eq a 6 becomes a 7 x a a 1 cos θ y b b 1 sin θ supposing a 1 ma and b 1 mb without loss of generality m 1 then the equation of the inner envelope is a 8 x 2 1 m a 2 y 2 1 m b 2 1 and the equation of the outer envelope is a 9 x 2 1 m a 2 y 2 1 m b 2 1 hence both the inner and outer envelopes are ellipses with the same eccentricity as ellipses a and b the ratio of the semi major axis lengths of the inner and outer envelope to that of ellipse a is 1 m and 1 m respectively lemma 2 the centers of ellipses a and b in lemma 1 the point of tangency between ellipse b and its outer envelope are collinear proof in fig a 1 line y kx goes through point o the center of ellipse a and an arbitrary point c on ellipse a ellipse b is centered at point c and with the same orientation as ellipse a the intersection point between the line y kx and the ellipse s outer envelope is point d it will be proved below that d is the point of tangency between ellipse b and its outer envelope since point c is the intersection point of line y kx and ellipse a it can be expressed as a 10 x c ab b 2 a 2 k 2 y c kab b 2 a 2 k 2 and it can also be defined as a 11 x c a cos θ y c b sin θ where tan θ ka b and k tan θ 0 similarly the intersection point d between the line y kx and the outer envelope can be expressed as a 12 x d a a 1 cos θ y d b b 1 sin θ where tan θ k a a 1 b b 1 since β ab 1 ba 1 1 is assumed it can be deduced that tan θ k a a 1 b b 1 ka b it can be verified that x d y d satisfies eq a 2 which means that point d is also on the ellipse b now that point d is on the ellipse b and also on its outer envelope it is the point of tangency between the two so it is proved that the points o c and d are collinear next the two lemmas will be applied further to analyze the scale of the lagrangian drift ellipse over multi tidal periods under an ideal condition that a water parcel starts from one initial tidal phase and can continuously move for multiple periods while keeping the initial tidal phase of this water parcel constant the scale of the lagrangian drift ellipse starting from a fixed position can evolve as shown in fig a 2 the water parcel at the initial position with the initial phase θ 0 0 2 π can form a lagrangian drift ellipse ellipse a1 in fig a 2 with the spatial scale of κ 3 l c after one tidal period the center of ellipse a1 is obtained by translating the initial fixed position by l mtv net displacement of the mass transport velocity over one tidal period based on the derivation process of the lagrangian residual velocity mtv in the area with the scale of κ 3 l c is constant and accurate to the order of o κ 2 hence the water parcel on ellipse a1 will form an equal ellipse b1 the blue ellipse in fig a 2 after the motion during the second tidal period if only mtv is considered but when lrv is considered accurate to the second order the water parcels starting from ellipse a1 with different initial phases will form a set of ellipses a1 the red ellipses in fig a 2 are equal to ellipse a1 their centers are located on ellipse b1 after the motion over two tidal periods the spatial coverage of all the ellipses a1 is the range of ending position that the water parcel forms after continuous motion over two tidal periods based on lemma 1 the outer envelope of ellipse a1 is an ellipse that is parallel to ellipse a1 labeled as ellipse a2 the length of the semi major axis of the ellipse a2 is 2 κ 3 l c if the water parcels move further over another tidal period ellipse a3 can be formed as the outer envelope of a set of ellipses a2 equal to ellipse a1 for the same reason the length of the semi major axis of ellipse a3 is 3 κ 3 l c if after n tidal periods ellipse an parallel to ellipse a1 can be formed with the scale of its semi major axis length being n κ 3 l c the scale of the lagrangian drift velocity is equal to the scale of the lagrangian drift ellipse n κ 3 l c divided by tidal periods 2 π n i e κ 3 l c 2 π based on the expression of u ld u ld cos θ 0 u ld sin θ 0 the initial phase is the angle between the x axis i e the direction of the mass transport velocity and the line which connects each point on the ellipse a1 an with their centers assuming that a water parcel starting from one initial tidal phase continuously moves for multiple periods and supposing that the initial tidal phase of this water parcel can be constant on every n tidal period lagrangian drift ellipse then according to lemma 2 the ending position of the water parcel can always be located on the outer envelope so that the scale of the lagrangian drift ellipse can be kept n κ 3 l c to give an intuitive demonstration of the trend of the mass transport velocity and the lagrangian drift ellipse the results of a sverdrup wave feng et al 1986a are shown as an example in sections 4 1 and 4 2 the zeroth order velocity field with all the variables being dimensionless of the sverdrup wave can be expressed as a 13 u 0 sin θ x u 0 cos θ u 0 sin θ v 0 f cos θ x v 0 cos θ v 0 sin θ where u 0 sin x u 0 cos x v 0 f cos x and v 0 f sin x appendix b the results of flow network with different node size are as follows

23788,there has been no quantitative assessment of the wave attenuation coefficient on the coral reef flat in south china sea scs previously based on midas dwr directional wave recorder an in situ experiment was carried out on a coral reef flat of yongle atoll scs waves and currents were measured at several locations on the reef flat which were used to estimate wave attenuation due to bottom friction a spectral wave model based on the action density balance equations is proposed to solve the wave attenuation coefficients on the coral reef flat which can consider influence of currents the wave attenuation coefficients due to bottom friction on the coral reef flat were found to be one order of magnitude greater than that recommended in most spectral wave models additionally numerical simulation using a third generation wave model swan was carried out the simulation results verify in turn that the bottom friction plays a predominant role in the wave attenuation on the coral reef flat it also captures the main characteristic of wave directional spectra with high precision the study of the wave attenuation characteristics near islands and reefs will lay a foundation for the mechanism of wave propagating near islands and reefs keywords wave attenuation coral reef flat bottom friction in situ measurement spectral wave model directional spectra data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years the south china sea scs has gradually undergone economic development offshore floating platforms are important forms of equipment for exploiting and utilizing resources on or around islands and reefs e g vlfs very large floating structure ding et al 2021 2019 wu et al 2018 ding et al 2017 for the safety of offshore floating structures deployed near islands and reefs it is important to understand the wave characteristics in the design of the platform and its mooring system however the wave characteristics near islands and reefs are quite different from the open sea due to the effects of the complex hydrodynamic interactions from the islands and seabed profile such as refraction diffraction reflection shoaling run up breaking and etc from the viewpoint of energy processes part of the wave momentum will be transferred into currents parallel to the coastline and the other part induces wave set up and set down in the direction perpendicular to the coastline the geological characteristics and roughness of the sea bottom have great influence on the propagation and evolution of waves and currents in the shallow waters of a coral reef flat the energy dissipation of waves and currents take place primarily due to the bottom friction early studies on bottom friction at ala moana reef honolulu usa and australia s great barrier reefs using buoys or adcps acoustic doppler current profilers in the 1980s were carried out and the works were reported by gerristen 1980 and young 1989 from the 1990s to the beginning of the 21st century studies on barrier reefs where a lagoon exists on the leeward side of the reef were also conducted by hardy and young 1996 nelson 1992 1996 hardy et al 2000 lugo fernandez et al 1998a b and lowe et al 2005 for example lowe et al 2005 conducted a 2 week field experiment by adcp advs acoustic doppler velocimeters to measure surface wave dissipation on a barrier reef at kaneohe bay oahu hawaii and acquired the energy dissipation caused by wave breaking and bottom friction the scholars compute bottom friction coefficient applying the governing equations of wave energy flux in the last ten years the research on the dynamic characteristics of waves of coral reefs are further developed and deepened monismith 2007 péquignet et al 2011 huang et al 2012 pomeroy et al 2012 monismith et al 2013 lentz et al 2015 monismith et al 2015 rogers et al 2015 harris et al 2018 so far there are very limited studies on the characteristics of wave attenuation near the shorelines in scs by field experiments especially on the in situ measurement of wave attenuation coefficients due to bottom friction of coral reef flats in scs in the past li et al 2003 used directional wave recorder to acquire the wave attenuation character not giving the information of the wave attenuation coefficients due to bottom friction at yongshu reefs scs additionally the laboratory experiments on bottom friction in water wave basin or wave flume can be seen in most references such as kamphuis 1975 joseph 1989 gourlay 1992 1994 1996a b mirfenderesk and young 2003 xu et al 2015 and tian et al 2016 there are also some scholars who use a theoretical model of the turbulent wave boundary layers such as trowbridge and madsen 1984a b aydin and shuto 1998 and hsu and ou 1997 to acquire the wave attenuation characteristics due to bottom friction because of the unique topography and geomorphology of coral reefs the wave attenuation characteristics are obvious so it is necessary to quantitatively evaluate the attenuation coefficient and then apply it to the numerical model which can provide accurate wave extreme conditions for the floating platform near islands and reefs this paper is divided into four parts the first part presents the theoretical model of the wave attenuation due to bottom friction the field site experiment conducted by the authors to measure the wave attenuation coefficients is presented in the second part the third part employs the numerical simulations to evaluate the wave attenuation due to bottom friction on coral reef flats the last part gives a conclusion 2 model of wave attenuation on coral reef flats 2 1 1d model applied in in situ measurement study in the in situ measurement the instruments are often arranged according to the propagating line of the main direction of waves therefore it can be simplified as a 1 dimensional 1d problem referring to hasselmann et al 1973 bouws and komen 1983 booij et al 1996 tolman 2009 and the swan team 2016 the equation for computing the bottom friction coefficient based on the action density balance is 1 n t u x c g x n x s f σ eq 1 is the conservation form of wave action density

situ measurement and conditions 3 1 description the in situ measurement was conducted to evaluate the wave attenuation coefficient caused by coral seabed in yongle atoll scs in 25th july 2017 on the top side of fig 1 the bathymetry contour of yongle atoll is shown from the figure it shows that the outer of the atoll is deep water area and the inner of that is lagoon with 30 50 m water depth the field study area is located in southeast side of the atoll only two midas dwr directional wave recorder were applied for the in situ measurement of wave attenuation on the coral reef flat the water depth of which is about 3 5 m the layout of the instrument locations designated as q 1 and q 2 is shown in lower left of fig 1 in which the waves coming towards the examined shoreline the distance between q 1 and q 2 is about 200 m meanwhile a wave buoy was deployed inside the lagoon denoted by location p where the water depth is about 30 m the measured data at location p were used as incoming wave parameters when simulating the wave attenuation on a coral reef flat the wind parameters were obtained from the measurement at location w which is also shown in fig 1 the data from p and w is used for the simulation discussed in section 4 in addition characteristics of seabed of the coral reef flat can be seen in lower right of fig 1 in the measurements the wave and current data were recorded every 20 min each consisting of 4096 points with a 0 125 s sampling period it means that the working time of dwr is about 8 53 min and the rest time of it is in sleeping mode for each 20 min 3 2 instruments the general water depth of the coral reef flat is shallow as most wave measuring instruments based on pressure can work well in water depth of above 5 m two dwrs were deployed at q 1 and q 2 to measure the wave and current parameters on the coral reef flat as shown in fig 1 the datawell directional wave buoy was deployed at location p a wind buoy was deployed at location w the instrument locations and settings are listed in table 1 3 3 measurement data the experiment lasted over 8 h in the field study area the measured parameters including water depth wind wave and current are shown in fig 2 the flood tide occurred during the field measurement the average water depth at q 1 and q 2 is about 2 7 m and 5 0 m respectively fig 2a the slope of sea bottom is approximately 1 100 the definition of wind direction wave direction and current direction are defined by nautical convention it means that the definitions of wind direction and wave direction are both determined by incoming direction of geographic orientation the definition of current direction is determined by going direction of geographic orientation the measured parameters such as the wind velocity and direction u w u d significant wave height h s wave peak period t p and peak wave direction d p are also shown in fig 2 the measurement lasted for 8 h and 40 min in which each data point represents the original data according to recording time the values of the wind velocity are in range of 2 5 5 2 m s and the wind direction are in the range of 120 168 fig 2b the blank parts in fig 2b are due to the missing data in the records it can be seen that the wave height at q 2 is mostly larger than that at q 1 and the wave height at p is mostly larger than that at q 2 fig 2c h while the difference in t p is mostly less than 1 s and no more than 2 s the t p values measured at location p are much closer to those at q 2 than at q 1 fig 2d i the measured wave directions at q 1 and q 2 are very close to each other basically within the range of 280 290 while at p the wave direction is in the range of 250 280 fig 2e j there are some differences between wind directions of e and wave direction of p the wind direction at point w can basically represent the wave direction of the deep sea outside the island reef the offshore waves propagate from the outer southeast of the island reef to p in the lagoon affected by terrain refraction the wave direction tends to be perpendicular to terrain contour lines and changes to be west or northwest in general all the three locations were experiencing waves from the west or northwest during the period of the measurement q 1 and q 2 are significantly affected by the topography of the front edge of the reef slope and the waves are refracted so the wave direction is different from the wave direction of point p from the analysis of k d additionally the average value of q 1 is 0 486 the average value of q 2 is 0 724 and the average value of point p is 2 891 strictly speaking waves at q 1 q 2 and p are all intermediate depth waves π 10 kd π all the measured current velocity values are smaller than 0 14 m s fig 2f which are insignificant compared with the velocity of the wave propagation according to eq 2 the average group velocity at q 2 is about 6 3 m s the average group velocity at q 1 is about 4 4 m s the directions of the current at q 1 and q 2 are seen to have big fluctuations and are also different by about 110 to 140 degrees before 19 00 but they become much closer to each other after 19 00 fig 2 g the possible reason is combined effect of tide variation and incoming wave direction variation as the period from 15 40 to 19 00 corresponds to ebb tide the water level falls additionally there are some relatively large differences between the incoming wave directions p location in fig 2j and wave directions of q 1 q 2 fig 2e the impact of the incoming wave on the current is large which causes the current directions sensitive on the contrary the period after 19 00 corresponds to flood tide the directions of the incoming waves are stable and the water level rises the impact of the incoming wave on the current is small which causes the current directions non sensitive 3 4 analysis of data applying the eq 1 to eq 9 the wave attenuation coefficients are evaluated fig 3a shows that the wave attenuation coefficients follow a normal distribution when the influence of the current is considered the coefficients demonstrate a great variation in their values c b t 0 1381 0 7044 m 2 s 3 and the statistical mean value is 0 485 m2s 3 with the 95 confidence interval which is one order of magnitude bigger than that the default values 0 038 m2s 3 in most spectral models such as hasselmann et al 1973 bouws and komen 1983 booij et al 1996 tolman 2009 and the swan team 2016 the values of numerical models mostly come from sandy or muddy sea bottoms the tendency was also mentioned by hardy et al 2000 the increased attenuation effect is attributed to the rough seabed surface generated by the reef organisms which makes the reef highly efficient at dissipating wave energy by bottom friction fig 3b shows the distribution of wave attenuation coefficients without current it is similar with one considering currents in addition there is little discrepancy between the values with currents and those neglecting currents in fig 4 the primary cause is that the average value of current velocities is 0 036 m s approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than the wave group velocity therefore the influence of current can be neglected in eq 1 when the current velocity is very low the comparison results of wave heights with and without current are further stated in section 4 of numerical simulation according to eq 4 the bottom friction coefficient f w is solved and distributed in the range of 0 23 to 1 08 the bottom friction coefficients basically follow a normal distribution as well as seen in fig 5 the statistical mean value of f w is 0 7472 with the 95 confidence interval the bottom friction coefficient of the study site is more than twice as much as the value 0 28 0 29 on the barrier reef at kaneohe bay oahu hawaii lowe et al 2005 it also indicates that the roughness of the coral reef flat is relatively high 4 simulation of wave attenuation on the coral reef flat 4 1 case scenarios in fig 1 a computational domain including in situ experiment sites is selected the length and width of the computation domain are both 4444 44 m the grid number along length and width is 200 and the grid size is 22 22 m close to the 20 m resolution of the measured terrain as shown in fig 6 the setup of swan model is summarized in table 2 in the simulation process there are several scenarios to be addressed i considering that the current velocities are so small and having little effect on wave attenuation as mentioned before the current is neglected ii although the wind is expected to have little effect in several kilometers scope the wind velocities and directions are acquired from a wind buoy marked by w in fig 1 deployed nearby and are used as wind input data for the completeness of input information iii the wave attenuation coefficients from experiment are employed instead of the recommended values and the coefficient corresponding to each time point is applied iv the measured wave parameters at location p are used as parameters of incoming waves at the border of the computation domain this is because point p is located upstream in the direction of wave propagation v incoming wave conditions are defined by the in situ observational directional spectrum 4 2 simulation results at first it is necessary to identify the ratio of the sink term s bf caused by bottom friction to the total source sink terms in shallow waters with a coral reef type of seabed for example fig 7 shows the distributions of the source sink terms at q 1 and q 2 with frequencies corresponding to the minimum mean and maximum c b t values the results show that the sink term s bf caused by bottom friction is a major component of the total source sink terms the other source sink terms are basically equal to zero the simulation verifies that for small waves on coral reef flats the bottom friction is a predominant component causing the wave attenuation the wind growth is almost zero too because the wind fetch length is too short and contributes too little to wave generated additionally the averaged wave steepness at point p is 0 0048 the averaged wave steepness at point q 2 is 0 0049 and the one at point q 1 is 0 0060 all the wave steepness at the three positions is very small and the conditions for wave breaking are not available it further shows that the wave breaking causing the wave attenuation on coral reef flats can be neglected secondly the in situ observational directional spectrum in the incoming waves is applied the significant wave heights of the calculation method are compared with the experiments in fig 8 the corresponding data corresponding to the selected times such as 16 00 18 00 19 00 21 00 and 23 00 in 25th july can be seen in table 3 fig 8a shows that the simulated significant wave heights when the waves propagating to the buoy position p point are almost consistent with the measured data and the error is within 0 5 that ensures the accuracy of the incoming waves on the inlet boundary the maximum error of the simulated result and the measured result at point q 2 is about 11 68 the maximum error of the simulated result of and the measured result at point q 1 is about 12 27 in general the simulation has high accuracy the main reason is that the measured direction spectrum is used as the input boundary which realistically reflects the real wave situation in addition the experimental directional spectra and the simulated ones of p q 1 and q 2 at the selected times 20170725 16 00 20170725 21 00 are shown in figs 9 and 10 general speaking the simulated directional spectra can describe basically the observational directional spectra especially for p the simulation shows excellent agreement with the details of directional spectra of the in situ experiment the patterns of directional spectra of q 1 and q 2 seem the same for the experimental results it shows that the bathymetry is relatively uniform and less affected by refraction effect that verifies that the wave attenuation coefficient due to bottom friction can be measured by one dimensional line array method in relatively flat terrain the patterns of the simulated directional spectra of q 1 and q 2 seem also the same the simulated wave peak directions agree well with the experimental ones there is some difference in the spreading directional angle between the experimental results and the simulated ones the former has a wider distribution than the latter the main reason may be that the resolution of the measured terrain is 20 m the simulation of 2d wave spectra refinement could require higher resolution of measured terrain the numerical simulation can also describe the wave height distribution of the whole field study area with and without current the comparison of the contours of the wave heights is shown at the selected time such as 20170725 16 00 in fig 11 it can be seen that there is almost the same distribution of the wave heights considering the current with c s 0 1 m s c d 287 the main reason is that compared with the wave group velocity the current velocity is nearly two orders of magnitude smaller 5 conclusions it is first time that the quantitative assessment of the wave attenuation coefficient on the coral reef flat in scs is presented by conducting in situ measurement and numerical simulations in this paper the study leads to the following conclusions 1 the method of computing the wave attenuation coefficient caused by bottom friction based on action density balance equation is put forward and elaborately presented the statistical mean value of wave attenuation coefficients due to bottom friction on coral sea bed is 0 485 m2s 3 which is one order of magnitude higher than that recommended by the spectral wave modes 0 038 m2s 3 when the current velocities are approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than the wave group velocity the influence of current on wave attenuation coefficients can be neglected 2 the experimental directional spectrums show that the wave attenuation coefficient due to bottom friction can be measured by one dimensional line array method in relatively flat terrain the simulation shows that the sink term caused by bottom friction is predominant in the total source sink terms on the coral reef flat waves are simulated by specifying the observational spectra on incoming wave boundary comparing with the in situ experiment the simulation agrees well with observation the current work focuses on the attenuation of waves in coral bottomed intermediate water depths however there is a very limited data due to short observational period in the future buoys or adcps will be deployed in further outer lagoon and deeper waters to investigate the effects of other factors on

23788,there has been no quantitative assessment of the wave attenuation coefficient on the coral reef flat in south china sea scs previously based on midas dwr directional wave recorder an in situ experiment was carried out on a coral reef flat of yongle atoll scs waves and currents were measured at several locations on the reef flat which were used to estimate wave attenuation due to bottom friction a spectral wave model based on the action density balance equations is proposed to solve the wave attenuation coefficients on the coral reef flat which can consider influence of currents the wave attenuation coefficients due to bottom friction on the coral reef flat were found to be one order of magnitude greater than that recommended in most spectral wave models additionally numerical simulation using a third generation wave model swan was carried out the simulation results verify in turn that the bottom friction plays a predominant role in the wave attenuation on the coral reef flat it also captures the main characteristic of wave directional spectra with high precision the study of the wave attenuation characteristics near islands and reefs will lay a foundation for the mechanism of wave propagating near islands and reefs keywords wave attenuation coral reef flat bottom friction in situ measurement spectral wave model directional spectra data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years the south china sea scs has gradually undergone economic development offshore floating platforms are important forms of equipment for exploiting and utilizing resources on or around islands and reefs e g vlfs very large floating structure ding et al 2021 2019 wu et al 2018 ding et al 2017 for the safety of offshore floating structures deployed near islands and reefs it is important to understand the wave characteristics in the design of the platform and its mooring system however the wave characteristics near islands and reefs are quite different from the open sea due to the effects of the complex hydrodynamic interactions from the islands and seabed profile such as refraction diffraction reflection shoaling run up breaking and etc from the viewpoint of energy processes part of the wave momentum will be transferred into currents parallel to the coastline and the other part induces wave set up and set down in the direction perpendicular to the coastline the geological characteristics and roughness of the sea bottom have great influence on the propagation and evolution of waves and currents in the shallow waters of a coral reef flat the energy dissipation of waves and currents take place primarily due to the bottom friction early studies on bottom friction at ala moana reef honolulu usa and australia s great barrier reefs using buoys or adcps acoustic doppler current profilers in the 1980s were carried out and the works were reported by gerristen 1980 and young 1989 from the 1990s to the beginning of the 21st century studies on barrier reefs where a lagoon exists on the leeward side of the reef were also conducted by hardy and young 1996 nelson 1992 1996 hardy et al 2000 lugo fernandez et al 1998a b and lowe et al 2005 for example lowe et al 2005 conducted a 2 week field experiment by adcp advs acoustic doppler velocimeters to measure surface wave dissipation on a barrier reef at kaneohe bay oahu hawaii and acquired the energy dissipation caused by wave breaking and bottom friction the scholars compute bottom friction coefficient applying the governing equations of wave energy flux in the last ten years the research on the dynamic characteristics of waves of coral reefs are further developed and deepened monismith 2007 péquignet et al 2011 huang et al 2012 pomeroy et al 2012 monismith et al 2013 lentz et al 2015 monismith et al 2015 rogers et al 2015 harris et al 2018 so far there are very limited studies on the characteristics of wave attenuation near the shorelines in scs by field experiments especially on the in situ measurement of wave attenuation coefficients due to bottom friction of coral reef flats in scs in the past li et al 2003 used directional wave recorder to acquire the wave attenuation character not giving the information of the wave attenuation coefficients due to bottom friction at yongshu reefs scs additionally the laboratory experiments on bottom friction in water wave basin or wave flume can be seen in most references such as kamphuis 1975 joseph 1989 gourlay 1992 1994 1996a b mirfenderesk and young 2003 xu et al 2015 and tian et al 2016 there are also some scholars who use a theoretical model of the turbulent wave boundary layers such as trowbridge and madsen 1984a b aydin and shuto 1998 and hsu and ou 1997 to acquire the wave attenuation characteristics due to bottom friction because of the unique topography and geomorphology of coral reefs the wave attenuation characteristics are obvious so it is necessary to quantitatively evaluate the attenuation coefficient and then apply it to the numerical model which can provide accurate wave extreme conditions for the floating platform near islands and reefs this paper is divided into four parts the first part presents the theoretical model of the wave attenuation due to bottom friction the field site experiment conducted by the authors to measure the wave attenuation coefficients is presented in the second part the third part employs the numerical simulations to evaluate the wave attenuation due to bottom friction on coral reef flats the last part gives a conclusion 2 model of wave attenuation on coral reef flats 2 1 1d model applied in in situ measurement study in the in situ measurement the instruments are often arranged according to the propagating line of the main direction of waves therefore it can be simplified as a 1 dimensional 1d problem referring to hasselmann et al 1973 bouws and komen 1983 booij et al 1996 tolman 2009 and the swan team 2016 the equation for computing the bottom friction coefficient based on the action density balance is 1 n t u x c g x n x s f σ eq 1 is the conservation form of wave action density

current along the locations of gauges that means that u x and c g x is obtained by projecting the peak wave direction along the location path the wave group velocity is acquired by 2 c g 1 2 1 2 k d sinh 2 k d c where c is phase velocity of wave which is calculated by g k tanh kd g is the gravitational acceleration and the value is 9 81m s2 d is the water depth and k is the wave number the bottom

coastal engineering booij et al 1996 zijlema 2010 akpınar et al 2012 xie et al 2016 therefore swan is employed to model the in situ experiment the spectral action balance equation is described as

situ measurement and conditions 3 1 description the in situ measurement was conducted to evaluate the wave attenuation coefficient caused by coral seabed in yongle atoll scs in 25th july 2017 on the top side of fig 1 the bathymetry contour of yongle atoll is shown from the figure it shows that the outer of the atoll is deep water area and the inner of that is lagoon with 30 50 m water depth the field study area is located in southeast side of the atoll only two midas dwr directional wave recorder were applied for the in situ measurement of wave attenuation on the coral reef flat the water depth of which is about 3 5 m the layout of the instrument locations designated as q 1 and q 2 is shown in lower left of fig 1 in which the waves coming towards the examined shoreline the distance between q 1 and q 2 is about 200 m meanwhile a wave buoy was deployed inside the lagoon denoted by location p where the water depth is about 30 m the measured data at location p were used as incoming wave parameters when simulating the wave attenuation on a coral reef flat the wind parameters were obtained from the measurement at location w which is also shown in fig 1 the data from p and w is used for the simulation discussed in section 4 in addition characteristics of seabed of the coral reef flat can be seen in lower right of fig 1 in the measurements the wave and current data were recorded every 20 min each consisting of 4096 points with a 0 125 s sampling period it means that the working time of dwr is about 8 53 min and the rest time of it is in sleeping mode for each 20 min 3 2 instruments the general water depth of the coral reef flat is shallow as most wave measuring instruments based on pressure can work well in water depth of above 5 m two dwrs were deployed at q 1

038 m2s 3 when the current velocities are approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than the wave group velocity the influence of current on wave attenuation coefficients can be neglected 2 the experimental directional spectrums show that the wave attenuation coefficient due to bottom friction can be measured by one dimensional line array method in relatively flat terrain the simulation shows that the sink term caused by bottom friction is predominant in the total source sink terms on the coral reef flat waves are simulated by specifying the observational spectra on incoming wave boundary comparing with the in situ experiment the simulation agrees well with observation the current work focuses on the attenuation of waves in coral bottomed intermediate water depths however there is a very limited data due to short observational period in the future buoys or adcps will be deployed in further outer lagoon and deeper waters to investigate the effects of other factors on the wave attenuation for a more compressive understanding of the wave attenuation mechanism credit authorship contribution statement wenwei chen investigation methodology writing original draft

23789,forecast downscaling for accurate nearshore wave conditions is important for a range of marine and coastal users however it is complex and high resolution forecasting methods are computationally intensive especially when being applied at scale identifying methods of downscaling to a high resolution with accuracy and increased computational efficiency is desired the prediction of wave parameters using machine learning techniques is becoming increasingly popular potentially offering more computational efficiency other computationally efficient techniques also exist such as the hybrid downscale technique and lookup table approaches this paper compares three data driven methods for downscaling offshore wave conditions to a typical computationally intensive process based approach a typical calibrated process based wave model was used to create a catalogue of data from which to develop data driven models the comparison was also extended to include the use of wave parameter observations each of the data driven methods showed comparable or improved numerical performance to the process driven technique particularly for the hs parameter with an up to 16 improvement in root mean squared error over the process based model both data driven approaches were considerably more computationally efficient between eleven and seven thousand times faster than the process based model however limitations were identified that should be considered when applying data driven approaches for predicting wave parameters such as availability and consistency of data and the ability of simple parameters to represent complex sea states keywords machine learning hypercube wave modelling data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction understanding and accurately predicting wave conditions in and around coastlines is important for a range of industries such as maritime transport and fishing but also recreation and disaster management getting this information often requires the development of computationally expensive modelling approaches various techniques have been developed to improve computational performance in the field of wave modelling such as the hybrid downscale technique camus 2006 backward ray tracing oh 1981 crosby et al 2019 look up tables ea 2016 statistical models hegermiller et al 2017 and meta models gouldby et al 2014 machine learning is being increasingly applied to the prediction of coastal and marine conditions including wave modelling forecasting and bias correction demetriou et al 2021 mooneyham et al 2020 james et al 2017 reikard and rogers 2011 browne et al 2007 deo et al 2001 the application of neural networks has been an area of significant research this paper aims to compare the phase averaged wave model booij et al 1997 hybrid downscale technique camus 2006 and multi layer perceptron pedregosa et al 2011 models ability to downscale offshore wave conditions height period and direction to nearshore in an operational or forecast mode many papers have identified that machine learning techniques like neural networks can be applied to predict wave conditions deo et al 2001 reikard and rogers 2011 frameworks for approaches to wave parameter prediction using machine learning methods have even been proposed such as in james et al 2017 but as discussed in gracia et al 2021 challenges still exist particularly in areas with complex sea states where generalisations are less applicable most of the literature has focussed on accuracy drawing comparisons with existing techniques and outlining some of the computational benefits such as in reikard and rogers 2011 and strauss et al 2007 the main gap in current research is understanding the practical applicability of each approach which is often hard to identify without spending considerable time attempting it this paper will discuss some of the strengths and weaknesses of the approaches applied from the perspective of utilising them in a operational forecasting system the objective is to help the practitioner or modeller understand some of the requirements and potential limitations of each approach specifically a typical process based modelling approach to spatial and temporally high resolution nearshore wave modelling in this case downscaling from an offshore model is compared to some of the more popular and simple data driven approaches this comparison will include a discussion of the requirements for each approach and ease of application 2 methodology 2 1 overview the following methodology has been developed so that a clear comparison can be made between a well established process based approach and a data driven approach techniques such as those applied in this paper require a minimum amount of data in order for them to be developed pedregosa et al 2011 observational data was considered to develop these models but is spatially limited point based monitoring locations and suffers from data gaps and errors swan was chosen as the process based model it performs well in coastal areas including in the study region browne et al 2007 and is used in forecasting mode by organisations globally van der westhuysen et al 2013 using a modelling approach that includes a spatial domain also means conditions can be extracted from any location within the domain which is more realistic for real world applications offshore boundary conditions were derived from the research variant of the auswave wave model operated by the bureau of meteorology zieger and greenslade 2021 the model runs 4 times a day at 00 00 06 00 12 00 and 18 00 coordinated universal time utc fig 1 provides a schematic overview of the approaches and the steps and linkages between each approach from offshore data to nearshore output each is described in more detail in the following section the machine learning data driven approaches were selected based on those commonly applied in the literature james et al 2017 reikard and rogers 2011 browne et al 2007 deo et al 2001 the hybrid downscale technique was selected as an alternative data driven method which has also been applied in the literature bonanata et al 2010 camus 2006 2 2 swan to overcome the spatial limitations of point based in situ measurement swan was used to construct an underlying dataset which could then be used to develop the data driven approaches neural network and hybrid downscaling technique the objective being to transform or downscale offshore boundary conditions to nearshore locations also known as nesting amrutha et al 2016 two different model configurations were used and are outlined in fig 1 and detailed in sections 2 2 2 and 2 2 3 the key difference between the two configurations is one is stationary to develop a catalogue of conditions for the hybrid downscaling technique and the other is non stationary which provides data for the timeseries based neural network s each is described in more detail in the following subsections 2 2 1 swan calibration as shown in fig 1 two swan model configurations were developed one stationary using a range representative conditions herein referred to as an event catalogue and another based on the auswave forecast model zieger and greenslade 2021 to undertake calibration and validation in comparison with observations a non stationary version of the swan model forced with the auswave boundary conditions was developed first the swan model was calibrated and validated through comparison with several wave monitoring locations in the nearshore part of the model domain as shown in fig 2 the swan model was run for a month with a variety of configurations to identify which offered the best performance see appendix 1 in the supplementary materials for details validation was then conducted by running the model for 8 months and comparing with observations appendix 2 model numerics and physics selected through calibration were kept consistent between the auswave forced non stationary and event catalogue stationary versions of the swan model more information about the swan model calibration can be found in the supplementary material 2 2 2 swan auswave forced the non stationary swan model was forced by the auswave wave model with approximately 8 5 months of in situ wave buoy data used for evaluation for consistency between swan and the data driven approaches neural network and hybrid downscaling integrated wave parameters were applied as an alongshore uniform offshore boundary based on an auswave model point selected centrally at the offshore boundary a jonswap spectrum was then adopted in the swan configuration to force the model swan 2019 the benefits of this approach are it is relatively simple to develop and allows for the generation of a large amount of consistent data however there are some considerable limitations such as poor performance in mixed sea states which are discussed at length in section 4 5 the auswave offshore model is run at 12 hourly intervals at 1 hourly time steps out to 10 days the swan model was run in non stationary mode out to 12 h the results of each run were then combined to make a contiguous 1 hourly time series although this does introduce some inaccuracy in that one can assume the 12th time step is likely to be less accurate than the 0th using the 0th time step for each model run alone would mean a considerably smaller dataset for developing data driven models 2 2 3 swan event catalogue to generate a coastal condition dataset for the hybrid downscaling wave climate reduction technique camus 2006 a swan model with the same physics and numerics was also run in stationary mode all parameters used were consistent between the two configurations and are outlined in section 2 2 the full configuration is described in section 5 of the supplementary material a catalogue of possible wave conditions was modelled based on the observed wave climate in the region derived from the brisbane wave monitoring buoy des 2021 this formed a catalogue of events which was used to develop the hybrid downscaling and neural network described further in the following sections 2 3 hypercube the hybrid downscaling technique known here after as the hypercube combines simulations of selected cases from the swan model and the reconstruction of waves nearshore via a lookup cube the method was previously described in detail by camus 2006 and bonanata et al 2010 and applied successfully near the study area by vieira da silva et al 2018 an important aspect of techniques like the hypercube is that they rely on long term datasets e g 40 years in this study encompassing a large range of conditions that include all the historical record in this sense the method used here is similar to the one presented by camus et al 2011 however their wave selection is based on dissimilar cases that happened in the historical record on the other hand the hypercube wave case selection is based on equidistant values of hs tp and dp allowing the extension of the limits of wave parameters to beyond the historical record this ensures that cases that have never been recorded can be accurately estimated the technique consists of four steps as follows 1 selecting a large range of wave cases 4560 encompassing cases that have happened in the past as well as extending it to ensure future cases that have not been seen in the historical record can be reproduced using this method cases were selected with consistent resolution to ensure any offshore case could be propagated onshore with the same degree of accuracy resolution hs 0 5 m to 9 m in increments of 0 5 m tp 2 s to 30 s in increments of 2 s dp 0 to 360 in increments of 22 5 additional waves heights of 0 25 m were later included to ensure very calm conditions were also represented selected cases are simulated with the same spectral resolution used for the other methods 2 run the selected cases 4560 using the swan configuration presented above as offshore boundary conditions 3 creating a 3 dimensional lookup table of waves offshore and nearshore points of interest 4 using the offshore waves as input conditions and the lookup table and linear interpolation to reconstruct any new individual wave parameters or time series at the interest points the technique can then be used to estimate wave parameters for any location within the model domain 2 4 neural network the neural network was applied in a similar way as described in james et al 2017 and peach et al 2020 aiming to predict a single parameter from a range of parameter inputs such as tp hs etc to a single output parameter with some success a simple multi layer perception model was selected as james et al 2017 found it performed well for predicting the hs parameter as with peach et al 2020 the multi layer perceptron machine learning modelling approach was applied using the sci kit learn python library pedregosa et al 2011 three different versions of this approach were applied and are described in more detail in the following section the first a more direct comparison with the hypercube method using a catalogue of representative conditions section 2 4 2 the second applied in a more typical time series approach similar to james et al 2017 section 2 4 3 and the third incorporating observations from a wave monitoring location section 2 4 4 2 4 1 neural network configuration neural network models require configuration the basic architecture of a neural network is described in fig 3 various components of the model often need to be changed iteratively and tested to identify the optimal configuration known as hyperparameter tuning the initial configuration was based on that used in james et al 2017 and peach et al 2020 iterative testing was then undertaken for the number of hidden layers and neurons with steps of 1 and 10 respectively for each hyperparameter for 10 steps of each the tanh activation function was also tested for 1 of each of the hyperparameter configurations the adam solver was selected as it is recommended in pedregosa et al 2011 for datasets of this size and was used in peach et al 2020 the final configuration for each approach and parameter is outlined in table 1 for consistency the data used for the time series machine learning approaches below identified as neural network approaches 2 and 3 were developed in a similar way a validation dataset approximately 22 days of data was separated from the available swan auswave offshore nearshore data and observational data further details about individual data preparation is provided in sections 2 4 2 2 4 3 and 2 4 4 two simple skill metrics were used to assesses the performance of each configuration root mean squared error and bias numerical performance was corroborated with visual inspection of all configurations and the target predictions the objective being to identify gross errors under and over fitting 2 4 2 neural network approach 1 trained using hypercube wave parameter catalogue this approach was devised to facilitate a direct comparison with the hypercube approach by using the same underlying dataset that is the catalogue of wave conditions used to construct the hypercube was used to train the multi layer perceptron model the catalogue consisted of three wave parameters hs tp and dp for each offshore and nearshore location the first step in developing the machine learning model from the catalogue of offshore and nearshore data was to undertake feature engineering the manipulation of data for the development and optimisation of machine learning models so that the machine learning model could perform as well as possible given the available data feature engineering for the wave parameter catalogue was limited to two steps first round all the parameters to two decimal places and then normalise second the dp parameter was converted into x cos dp and y sin dp components this is common practice and is used to help overcome challenges with circular data gracia et al 2021 as the wave data catalogue does not include temporally sequenced data each pair of offshore and nearshore conditions is treated independently therefore the training and testing data used to develop the machine learning model was shuffled prior to training and 20 was used for testing 80 for training 2 4 3 neural network approach 2 nearshore forecasting approach the second multi layer perceptron approach was trained using the 8 5 months of offshore conditions obtained from the auswave model and the results of the non stationary swan model at a nearshore location in this case at the site of a wave monitoring buoy several additional steps were required for this approach initially an auto correlation analysis was performed to understand the auto correlation of the parameter in this case hs over time this gives an indication of the similarity of the parameter over time i e how similar is wave height at the start t0 to the wave height an hour later t1 and so on on average the first 3 h showed a strong auto correlation with some but a weaker correlation out to 12 h this analysis was used to develop a training dataset which incorporated current and previous timestep information to make a prediction the architecture of the training and testing data is visualised in fig 4 this method attempts to include some form of continuity time coherence using the preceeding timesteps of the wave parameter being predicted to help inform a prediction therefore no shuffling of the data was used to ensure this continuity is maintained additionally the hs and tp values were normalised as before 20 of the available data was used for testing and 80 for training 2 4 4 neural network approach 3 trained using time series observational data the third multi layer perceptron approach was trained using a similar method to neural network approach 2 but in this case we added the observational data from the monitoring location where we were predicting conditions and removed the swan near shore prediction this removes the requirement for the swan nearshore prediction but has some limitations such as where it can be applied and how far in time predictions can be made in this configuration 12 h these are described further in section 4 5 similar steps were undertaken to those described in section 2 4 3 with two changes the revised architecture is shown in fig 5 the label or predictor is replaced by the observed parameter the observed value from 12 h prior to the predicted timestep is also added as a feature data was also not shuffled in this approach to help train the model with time continuity as before 20 of the available data was used for testing and 80 for training there are some additional limitations by including observational data these are discussed in section 4 5 3 results 3 1 numerical accuracy the performance metrics for numerical accuracy were selected based on those used in literature analysing wave model performance zieger and greenslade 2021 morim et al 2016 durrant et al 2014 and are outlined in tables 2 and 3 three wave parameters were evaluated for quantitative performance hs tp dp it should be noted that it is expected that the performance of each approach is being compared to that of the swan model as the benchmark as the objective is to assess the viability of each approach for the prediction of wave parameters 3 1 1 swan model results swan in non stationary mode at high resolution performed well however it can be noted that stepping was present in the results this is caused by changes in initial conditions for each forecast model run in other words there are changes in each run of the offshore forecast model this is associated with changes to forcing conditions applied from the numerical prediction weather model this is expected behaviour associated with the changes between each of the offshore forecast model runs and can be observed in fig 6 3 1 2 hypercube the hypercube showed generally good agreement with the swan model though as shown in fig 8 there was some significant deviation from modelled and observed data at several time steps this looks more significant than it is due to the cyclical nature of the parameter 0 and 360 are the same direction the skill metrics in tables 4 and 6 suggest broadly comparable performance to swan 3 1 3 neural network approach 1 closely approximated the performance of the hypercube in many cases however several of the skill metrics indicate a slight performance improvement over the hypercube method itself particularly for dp table 6 approach 2 showed generally good agreement with the swan model overall though performed more poorly particularly for dp this is visualised in fig 8 where during sudden changes in direction the approach performs poorly approach 3 showed similar or slightly improved performance over the swan model for the hs parameter the results are not as clear for tp and dp the skill metrics suggest generally comparable performance the tp parameter for approach 3 in particular suggests a positive bias compared with all the other approaches clear deviations from the other predictions can be observed in fig 7 3 2 results commentary hs generally performed the best overall for all approaches tp was particularly challenging to assess as it is sensitive to the frequency binning used in the spectral scheme analysis of the wave buoy displacement data this can be observed in fig 7 where clear banding is apparent in the observations compared with all the modelled approaches noting that all of them will be reliant on the swan spectral scheme swan also applies a parabolic fit of the largest or two bins creating a smoothed tp parameter swan 2019 the differences in the spectral scheme are less obvious but are also challenging for dp with often rapid changes or fluctuating between two different directs from time step to another this can be observed in the observations in fig 8 at various times including around the 15th february this fluctuation is particularly challenging for some machine learning techniques and could be compared to noise in the dataset 3 3 computational efficiency data driven methods show a clear edge in computational efficiency when compared with swan in this comparison the swan model was run in multi threaded mode on a 8 core 16 thread desktop computer in comparison the machine learning model used only a single core on the same desktop computer specification in supplementary material 4 discussion 4 1 development model development is different between the approaches but does share some similarities comparisons could be made between calibration of a process based model like swan e g mesh development and calibration and configuration of a machine learning model e g feature engineering and hyper parameter tuning however it is hard to make any more definitive comparisons as each depends on a range of factors which dictate the approach taken and the time to complete such the availability of observational data or bathymetry but all approaches required significant amounts of data to develop whether it is expensive to acquire bathymetry and boundary conditions such as with swan or years of time series of past conditions as such as with the time series machine learning approach however the availability of different datasets is likely to change the availability of information for different techniques for example a given area of interest may have poor bathymetric data but good wave observations and visa versa 4 2 skill on initial inspection the skill metrics in tables 4 6 indicate comparable performance between each of the approaches applied however there are some specific nuisances which warrant further discussion 4 2 1 hypercube neural network approach 1 for example on closer examination of fig 6 it is possible to see that both the machine learning hypercube and hypercube approach closely approximate each other this is corroborated by table 4 however some deviations can be observed in figs 6 8 there are two likely causes of these deviations wave conditions propagating offshore i e directions between 200 360 degrees as the hypercube would produce no near shore waves thus errors when compared with observations other deviations are likely to be caused by sea conditions where a wave spectrum is likely to have multiple peaks such as locally wind driven waves the hypercube cannot represent these cases as it only accounts for single peak spectrum conditions discussed further in section 4 5 nor can it incorporate the affects of local wind driven waves furthermore deviations between peak spectral parameters such as tp can also be attributed to a differences in spectral discretisation between model and observation buoy such as differing frequency bins spectral wave models typically use logarithmic frequency spacing dissimilar to those used in monitoring equipment making direct comparisons between approaches and observations challenging this difference in spectral discretisation can result in patterns appearing in direct comparisons as can be observed in fig 10 and for the swan model in fig 11 when comparing the hypercube with the neural network approach 1 both of which use the same source data some skill metrics suggest slightly better performance for both hs and dp however the skill metrics for tp rmse and scatter index indicate the hypercube performs slightly better fig 9 also indicates almost statistically insignificant differences between the two approaches close performance is expected between the two approached given they are based on similar input information it is possible but difficult to prove that some of the performance differences are due to the linear interpolation used as part of the hypercube method between conditions available in the event catalogue the neural network in comparison can include non linear relationships which may offer a marginal improvement in performance 4 2 2 neural network approach 2 the neural network approach 2 closely matches the swan model although some deviation can be observed neural network approach 2 showed less scatter even than the swan model used to develop it this may be due to some generalisations being made within the weights of the neural network performance of the neural network models using similar approaches broadly matches that found in gracia et al 2021 and james et al 2017 for significant wave height suggesting that for predicting wave height this approach is suitable performance for tp was comparable with that of the swan model with again obvious patterning appearing in fig 10 due to the limited spectral bins in the wave observations however one outlier is this approaches performance for predicting dp in table 6 the bias in particular deviates considerably compared to other approaches this could be related to rapid and large changes in dp over time which may be a result of a multi modal sea state and because this approach incorporates information from previous time steps in fig 8 the model is not able to predict large jumps in direction well this may be explained by under or over fitting however performance of other parameters suggests this is not the case 4 2 3 neural network approach 3 neural network approach 3 seems to match the range of the observations well in fig 6 and particularly with regard to tp 7 this is expected as it has more information than the other two approaches similar findings are present in fig 9 and table 5 the skill metrics should be considered with some scepticism given the differences in binning discussed in section 3 2 it is also assumed that some bias correction more applicable for tp is incorporated into the weights of the neural network that generally improve performance the skill metrics suggest that overall this approach when compared with observations slightly out performs some of the others as it includes observations by its nature it has access to more information and therefore is likely to have an advantage over the others however deviations do occur from all the other models and observations particularly between the 13 07 2021 and 17 03 2021 this may be to do with the introduction of noise like data points in the source observational data for example the fluctuation of data points especially associated with sudden and sharp changes which could be an indication of a multi modal sea state for parameters derived from the spectral peak in particular noisy data can impact machine learning model performance gupta and gupta 2019 typically wave observational data is noisier than modelled due to a variety of reasons including instrument noise local wind effects and signal issues smit et al 2021 incorporating observations can also be challenging when being deployed operationally as the approach is reliant on observational data being available without it this model could not make predictions 4 3 computational efficiency average run times in table 7 provides a broad comparison in terms of real world time to run offshore conditions to nearshore conditions the significant computational performance difference between the data driven and process driven methods is consistent with other findings james et al 2017 reikard and rogers 2011 whilst on small scales such as applied here the differences in run times are relatively small these and other results in the literature suggests significant computational efficiency with the data driven approaches even when scaling them up to much larger domains this could allow compute time for other things such as additional runs to develop ensembles such attributes may be an appealing consideration when deploying an operational forecasting model or looking to downscale a large number of conditions however run times could potentially be improved for the process based model with more computational power 4 4 applicability and effort based on each of the different approaches applied here and in the wider literature it is possible discuss the applicability and effort required broadly for each approach swan and other process based models have some strengths and weaknesses compared with data driven approaches when considering applicability and development effort process based models have some inherent benefits they are well understood and typically errors with them can be diagnosed they have an inherent understanding of the physics of the processes they are attempting to model and therefore are more likely to produce sensible results but they can be computationally expensive and have some specific data requirements such as the availability of good bathymetric information on the other hand data driven models can be extremely computationally efficient once training is completed as discussed in section 4 3 they can be applied without bathymetric or other geographic information making it possible to make a large number of predictions quickly it is also possible to apply them either to compliment or as a replacement to process based models however they have significant data requirements to develop them such as the need for a reasonable set of conditions to be trained on two different approaches to this have been described here they also do not have an inherent understanding of the physical processes meaning that if they are developed using limited or poor data predictions may be spurious furthermore generalisation is a risk when scaling some data driven approaches which will need to be considered if approaches like those applied here were expanded to incorporate a large geographical region often regional differences in performance can exist as shown by gracia et al 2021 4 5 limitations in order to provide a fair comparison a single peak parameterised jonswap spectrum was used hasselmann et al 1973 this was to ensure consistency between the approaches the hypercube can only be constructed from parameterised wave data it therefore made sense to apply a similar limitation to the other methods to allow for a more direct comparison this limitation is likely to particularly affect performance during multi model sea states particularly when swell and sea conditions have similar energy using this simplified parameterised spectrum approach is a key limitation of the hypercube and the machine learning models trained using the same catalogue of events as is the swan model used to develop this catalogue of events the performance of those methods is therefore likely to approximate the performance of the swan model any biases or other limitations in the swan model are likely to impact the performance of methods that use data from it the hypercube in particular is further limited in that it is applied using an alongshore uniform offshore boundary this means that a single offshore set of conditions might be used to describe a large geographic area in this case this limitation was applied to the other approaches for consistency without this limitation it is possible that further improvements in performance may be achieve by the other approaches approach 3 has an advantage over some of the other approaches as the neural network can be trained using observational data directly however this approach itself has an additional limitation in that it is only applicable where observational data is available spatially and temporally therefore its applicability is limited to specific points of regions some literature is available on assimilating observational data into a forecasting work flow smit et al 2021 but further exploration is likely warranted other considerations for using point based observational data includes processing of errors and defining a geographic area where observations are applicable other potential methodologies to improve the results and overcome the parameterised spectrum limitation could be through the use of the complete wave spectrum as opposed to parameters derived from the spectrum as used in this paper this would drastically increase the available data for data driven methods to be trained with and could be used to lessen the influence of the differences in spectral discretisation between the model and the observed data 5 conclusions neural network approaches seem to marginally outperform the hypercube in both accuracy and efficiency although it is possible this is partly due to the way in which the hypercube generalises the wave parameters and further refining could further reduce the differences however the neural network approaches do have some other distinct advantages such as flexibility of application either through a data catalogue or time series type approach one of the key advantages demonstrated with this methodology is the neural networks ability to train directly on observed data offering comparable performance without the need to develop a high resolution process based model when predicting conditions at locations that have observations all the methods have similar limitations around the availability of data to develop them some process based models can provide estimates of wave conditions with very limited observational data to calibrate them though the quality of such results could be drawn into question whilst all the data driven approaches used here suffered from similar limitations around data availability and were reliant on a process based model to generate the data needed to develop them this extends to neural network approach 3 as the offshore wave information is sourced from a process based model the neural network approaches showed significant computationally efficiency when compared with the process driven approach similar to findings in james et al 2017 this has some considerable implications when considering deploying an operational model where run times and computational performance are more important additionally data driven approaches with similar numerical performance to process based models could be used to facilitate far more computationally efficient ensemble predictions however critically data driven models are particularly reliant on the quality and quantity of data to develop them in some cases

23789,forecast downscaling for accurate nearshore wave conditions is important for a range of marine and coastal users however it is complex and high resolution forecasting methods are computationally intensive especially when being applied at scale identifying methods of downscaling to a high resolution with accuracy and increased computational efficiency is desired the prediction of wave parameters using machine learning techniques is becoming increasingly popular potentially offering more computational efficiency other computationally efficient techniques also exist such as the hybrid downscale technique and lookup table approaches this paper compares three data driven methods for downscaling offshore wave conditions to a typical computationally intensive process based approach a typical calibrated process based wave model was used to create a catalogue of data from which to develop data driven models the comparison was also extended to include the use of wave parameter observations each of the data driven methods showed comparable or improved numerical performance to the process driven technique particularly for the hs parameter with an up to 16 improvement in root mean squared error over the process based model both data driven approaches were considerably more computationally efficient between eleven and seven thousand times faster than the process based model however limitations were identified that should be considered when applying data driven approaches for predicting wave parameters such as availability and consistency of data and

2021 mooneyham et al 2020 james et al 2017 reikard and rogers 2011 browne et al 2007 deo et al 2001 the application of neural networks has been an area of significant research this paper aims to compare the phase averaged wave model booij et al 1997 hybrid downscale technique camus 2006 and multi layer perceptron pedregosa et al 2011 models ability to downscale offshore wave conditions height period and direction to nearshore in an operational or forecast mode many papers have identified that machine learning techniques like neural networks can be applied to predict wave conditions deo et al 2001 reikard and rogers 2011 frameworks for approaches to wave parameter prediction using machine learning methods have even been proposed such as in james et al 2017 but as discussed in gracia et al 2021 challenges still exist particularly in areas with complex sea states where generalisations are less applicable most of the literature has focussed on accuracy drawing comparisons with existing techniques and outlining some of the computational benefits such as in reikard and rogers 2011 and strauss et al 2007 the main gap in current research is understanding the practical applicability of each approach which is often hard to identify without spending considerable time attempting it this paper will discuss some of the strengths and weaknesses of the approaches applied from the perspective of utilising them in a operational forecasting system the objective is to help the practitioner or modeller understand some of the requirements and potential limitations of each approach specifically a typical process based modelling approach to spatial and temporally high resolution nearshore wave modelling in this case downscaling from an offshore model is compared to some of the more popular and simple data driven approaches this comparison will include a discussion of the requirements for each approach and ease of application 2 methodology 2 1 overview the following methodology has been developed so that a clear comparison can be made between a well established process based approach and a data driven approach techniques such as those applied in this paper require a minimum amount of data in order for them to be developed pedregosa et al 2011 observational data was considered to develop these models but is spatially limited point based monitoring locations and suffers from data gaps and errors swan was chosen as the process based model it performs well in coastal areas including in the study region browne et al 2007 and is used in forecasting mode by organisations globally van der westhuysen et al 2013 using a modelling approach that includes a spatial domain also means conditions can be extracted from any location within the domain which is more realistic for real world applications offshore boundary conditions were derived from the research variant of the auswave wave model operated by the bureau of meteorology zieger and greenslade 2021 the model runs 4 times a day at 00 00 06 00 12 00 and 18 00 coordinated universal time utc fig 1 provides a schematic overview of the approaches and the steps and linkages between each approach from offshore data to nearshore output each is described in more detail in the following section the machine learning data driven approaches were selected based on those commonly applied in the literature james et al 2017 reikard and rogers 2011 browne et al 2007 deo et al 2001 the hybrid downscale technique was selected as an alternative data driven method which has also been applied in the literature bonanata et al 2010 camus 2006 2 2 swan to overcome the spatial limitations of point based in situ measurement swan was used to construct an underlying dataset which could then be used to develop the data driven approaches neural network and hybrid downscaling technique the objective being to transform or downscale offshore boundary conditions to nearshore locations also known as nesting amrutha et al 2016 two different model configurations were used and are outlined in fig 1 and detailed in sections 2 2 2 and 2 2 3 the key difference between the two configurations is one is stationary to develop a catalogue of conditions for the hybrid downscaling technique and the other is non stationary which provides data for the timeseries based neural network s each is described in more detail in the following subsections 2 2 1 swan calibration as shown in fig 1 two swan model configurations were developed one stationary using a range representative conditions herein referred to as an event catalogue and another based on the auswave forecast model zieger and greenslade 2021 to undertake calibration and validation in comparison with observations a non stationary version of the swan model forced with the auswave boundary conditions was developed first the swan model was calibrated and validated through comparison with several wave monitoring locations in the nearshore part of the model domain as shown in fig 2 the swan model was run for a month with a variety of configurations to identify which offered the best performance see appendix 1 in the supplementary materials for details validation was then conducted by running the model for 8 months and comparing with observations appendix 2 model numerics and physics selected through calibration were kept consistent between the auswave forced non stationary and event catalogue stationary versions of the swan model more information about the swan model calibration can be found in the supplementary material 2 2 2 swan auswave forced the non stationary swan model was forced by the auswave wave model with approximately 8 5 months of in situ wave buoy data used for evaluation for consistency between swan and the data driven approaches neural network and hybrid downscaling integrated wave parameters were applied as an alongshore uniform offshore boundary based on an auswave model point selected centrally at the offshore boundary a jonswap spectrum was then adopted in the swan configuration to force the model swan 2019 the benefits of this approach are it is relatively simple to develop and allows for the generation of a large amount of consistent data however there are some considerable limitations such as poor performance in mixed sea states which are discussed at length in section 4 5 the auswave offshore model is run at 12 hourly intervals at 1 hourly time steps out to 10 days the swan model was run in non stationary mode out to 12 h the results of each run were then combined to make a contiguous 1 hourly time series although this does introduce some inaccuracy in that one can assume the 12th time step is likely to be less accurate than the 0th using the 0th time step for each model run alone would mean a considerably smaller dataset for developing data driven models 2 2 3 swan event catalogue to generate a coastal condition dataset for the hybrid downscaling wave climate reduction technique camus 2006 a swan model with the same physics and numerics was also run in stationary mode all parameters used were consistent between the two configurations and are outlined in section 2 2 the full configuration is described in section 5 of the supplementary material a catalogue of possible wave conditions was modelled based on the observed wave climate in the region derived from the brisbane wave monitoring buoy des 2021 this formed a catalogue of events which was used to develop the hybrid downscaling and neural network described further in the following sections 2 3 hypercube the hybrid downscaling technique known here after as the hypercube combines simulations of selected cases from the swan model and the reconstruction of waves nearshore via a lookup cube the method was previously described in detail by camus 2006 and bonanata et al 2010 and applied successfully near the study area by vieira da silva et al 2018 an important aspect of techniques like the hypercube is that they rely on long term datasets e g 40 years in this study encompassing a large range of conditions that include all the historical record in this sense the method used here is similar to the one presented by camus et al 2011 however their wave selection is based on dissimilar cases that happened in the historical record on the other hand the hypercube wave case selection is based on equidistant values of hs tp and dp allowing the extension of the limits of wave parameters to beyond the historical record this ensures that cases that have never been recorded can be accurately estimated the technique consists of four steps as follows 1 selecting a large range of wave cases 4560 encompassing cases that have happened in the past as well as extending it to ensure future cases that have not been seen in the historical record can be reproduced using this method cases were selected with consistent resolution to ensure any offshore case could be propagated onshore with the same degree of accuracy resolution hs 0 5 m to 9 m in increments of 0 5 m tp 2 s to 30 s in increments of 2 s dp 0 to 360 in increments of 22 5 additional waves heights of 0 25 m were later included to ensure very calm conditions were also represented selected cases are simulated with the same spectral resolution used for the other methods 2 run the selected cases 4560 using the swan configuration presented above as offshore boundary conditions 3 creating a 3 dimensional lookup table of waves offshore and nearshore points of interest 4 using the offshore waves as input conditions and the lookup table and linear interpolation to reconstruct any new individual wave parameters or time series at the interest points the technique can then be used to estimate wave parameters for any location within the model domain 2 4 neural network the neural network was applied in a similar way as described in james et al 2017 and peach et al 2020 aiming to predict a single parameter from a range of parameter inputs such as tp hs etc to a single output parameter with some success a simple multi layer perception model was selected as james et al 2017 found it performed well for predicting the hs parameter as with peach et al 2020 the multi layer perceptron machine learning modelling approach was applied using the sci kit learn python library pedregosa et al 2011 three different versions of this approach were applied and are described in more detail in the following section the first a more direct comparison with the hypercube method using a catalogue of representative conditions section 2 4 2 the second applied in a more typical time series approach similar to james et al 2017 section 2 4 3 and the third incorporating observations from a wave monitoring location section 2 4 4 2 4 1 neural network configuration neural network models require configuration the basic architecture of a neural network is described in fig 3 various components of the model often need to be changed iteratively and tested to identify the optimal configuration known as hyperparameter tuning the initial configuration was based on that used in james et al 2017 and peach et al 2020 iterative testing was then undertaken for the number of hidden layers and neurons with steps of 1 and 10 respectively for each hyperparameter for 10 steps of each the tanh activation function was also tested for 1 of each of the hyperparameter configurations the adam solver was selected as it is recommended in pedregosa et al 2011 for datasets of this size and was used in peach et al 2020 the final configuration for each approach and parameter is outlined in table 1 for consistency the data used for the time series machine learning approaches below identified as neural network approaches 2 and 3 were developed in a similar way a validation dataset approximately 22 days of data was separated from the available swan auswave offshore nearshore data and observational data further details about individual data preparation is provided in sections 2 4 2 2 4 3 and 2 4 4 two simple skill metrics were used to assesses the performance of each configuration root mean squared error and bias numerical performance was corroborated with visual inspection of all configurations and the target predictions the objective being to identify gross errors under and over fitting 2 4 2 neural network approach 1 trained using hypercube wave parameter catalogue this approach was devised to facilitate a direct comparison with the hypercube approach by using the same underlying dataset that is the catalogue of wave conditions used to construct the hypercube was used to train the multi layer perceptron model the catalogue consisted of three wave parameters hs tp and dp for each offshore and nearshore location the first step in developing the machine learning model from the catalogue of offshore and nearshore data was to undertake feature engineering the manipulation of data for the development and optimisation of machine learning models so that the machine learning model could perform as well as possible given the available data feature engineering for the wave parameter catalogue was limited to two steps first round all the parameters to two decimal places and then normalise second the dp parameter was converted into x cos dp and y sin dp components this is common practice and is used to help overcome challenges with circular data gracia et al 2021 as the wave data catalogue does not include temporally sequenced data each pair of offshore and nearshore conditions is treated independently therefore the training and testing data used to develop the machine learning model was shuffled prior to training and 20 was used for testing 80 for training 2 4 3 neural network approach 2 nearshore forecasting approach the second multi layer perceptron approach was trained using the 8 5 months of offshore conditions obtained from the auswave model and the results of the non stationary swan model at a nearshore location in this case at the site of a wave monitoring buoy several additional steps were required for this approach initially an auto correlation analysis was performed to understand the auto correlation of the parameter in this case hs over time this gives an indication of the similarity of the parameter over time i e how similar is wave height at the start t0 to the wave height an hour later t1 and so on on average the first 3 h showed a strong auto correlation with some but a weaker correlation out to 12 h this analysis was used to develop a training dataset which incorporated current and previous timestep information to make a prediction the architecture of the training and testing data is visualised in fig 4 this method attempts to include some form of continuity time coherence using the preceeding timesteps of the wave parameter being predicted to help inform a prediction therefore no shuffling of the data was used to ensure this continuity is maintained additionally the hs and tp values were normalised as before 20 of the available data was used for testing and 80 for training 2 4 4 neural network approach 3 trained using time series observational data the third multi layer perceptron approach was trained using a similar method to neural network approach 2 but in this case we added the observational data from the monitoring location where we were predicting conditions and removed the swan near shore prediction this removes the requirement for the swan nearshore prediction but has some limitations such as where it can be applied and how far in time predictions can be made in this configuration 12 h these are described further in section 4 5 similar steps were undertaken to those described in section 2 4 3 with two changes the revised architecture is shown in fig 5 the label or predictor is replaced by the observed parameter the observed value from 12 h prior to the predicted timestep is also added as a feature data was also not shuffled in this approach to help train the model with time continuity as before 20 of the available data was used for testing and 80 for training there are some additional limitations by including observational data these are discussed in section 4 5 3 results 3 1 numerical accuracy the performance metrics for numerical accuracy were selected based on those used in literature analysing wave model performance zieger and greenslade 2021 morim et al 2016 durrant et al 2014 and are outlined in tables 2 and 3 three wave parameters were evaluated for quantitative performance hs tp dp it should be noted that it is expected that the performance of each approach is being compared to that of the swan model as the benchmark as the objective is to assess the viability of each approach for the prediction of wave parameters 3 1 1 swan model results swan in non stationary mode at high resolution performed well however it can be noted that stepping was present in the results this is caused by changes in initial conditions for each forecast model run in other words there are changes in each run of the offshore forecast model this is associated with changes to forcing conditions applied from the numerical prediction weather model this is expected behaviour associated with the changes between each of the offshore forecast model runs and can be observed in fig 6 3 1 2 hypercube the hypercube showed generally good agreement with the swan model though as shown in fig 8 there was some significant deviation from modelled and observed data at several time steps this looks more significant than it is due to the cyclical nature of the parameter 0 and 360 are the same direction the skill metrics in tables 4 and 6 suggest broadly comparable performance to swan 3 1 3 neural network approach 1 closely approximated the performance of the hypercube in many cases however several of the skill metrics indicate a slight performance improvement over the hypercube method itself particularly for dp table 6 approach 2 showed generally good agreement with the swan model overall though performed more poorly particularly for dp this is visualised in fig 8 where during sudden changes in direction the approach performs poorly approach 3 showed similar or slightly improved performance over the swan model for the hs parameter the results are not as clear for tp and dp the skill metrics suggest generally comparable performance the tp parameter for approach 3 in particular suggests a positive bias compared with all the other approaches clear deviations from the other predictions can be observed in fig 7 3 2 results commentary hs generally performed the best overall for all approaches tp was particularly challenging to assess as it is sensitive to the frequency binning used in the spectral scheme analysis of the wave buoy displacement data this can be observed in fig 7 where clear banding is apparent in the observations compared with all the modelled approaches noting that all of them will be reliant on the swan spectral scheme swan also applies a parabolic fit of the largest or two bins creating a smoothed tp parameter swan 2019 the differences in the spectral scheme are less obvious but are also challenging for dp with often rapid changes or fluctuating between two different directs from time step to another this can be observed in the observations in fig 8 at various times including around the 15th february this fluctuation is particularly challenging for some machine learning techniques and could be compared to noise in the dataset 3 3 computational efficiency data driven methods show a clear edge in computational efficiency when compared with swan in this comparison the swan model was run in multi threaded mode on a 8 core 16 thread desktop computer in comparison the machine learning model used only a single core on the same desktop computer specification in supplementary material 4 discussion 4 1 development model development is different between the approaches but does share some similarities comparisons could be made between calibration of a process based model like swan e g mesh development and calibration and configuration of a machine learning model e g feature engineering and hyper parameter tuning however it is hard to make any more definitive comparisons as each depends on a range of factors which dictate the approach taken and the time to complete such the availability of observational data or bathymetry but all approaches required significant amounts of data to develop whether it is expensive to acquire bathymetry and boundary conditions such as with swan or years of time series of past conditions as such as with the time series machine learning approach however the availability of different datasets is likely to change the availability of information for different techniques for example a given area of interest may have poor bathymetric data but good wave observations and visa versa 4 2 skill on initial inspection the skill metrics in tables 4 6 indicate comparable performance between each of the approaches applied however there are some specific nuisances which warrant further discussion 4 2 1 hypercube neural network approach 1 for example on closer examination of fig 6 it is possible to see that both the machine learning hypercube and hypercube approach closely approximate each other this is corroborated by table 4 however some deviations can be observed in figs 6 8 there are two likely causes of these deviations wave conditions propagating offshore i e directions between 200 360 degrees as the hypercube would produce no near shore waves thus errors when compared with observations other deviations are likely to be caused by sea conditions where a wave spectrum is likely to have multiple peaks such as locally wind driven waves the hypercube cannot represent these cases as it only accounts for single peak spectrum conditions discussed further in section 4 5 nor can it incorporate the affects of local wind driven waves furthermore deviations between peak spectral parameters such as tp can also be attributed to a differences in spectral discretisation between model and observation buoy such as differing frequency bins spectral wave models typically use logarithmic frequency spacing dissimilar to those used in monitoring equipment making direct comparisons between approaches and observations challenging this difference in spectral discretisation can result in patterns appearing in direct comparisons as can be observed in fig 10 and for the swan model in fig 11 when comparing the hypercube with the neural network approach 1 both of which use the same source data some skill metrics suggest slightly better performance for both hs and dp however the skill metrics for tp rmse and scatter index indicate the hypercube performs slightly better fig 9 also indicates almost statistically insignificant differences between the two approaches close performance is expected between the two approached given they are based on similar input information it is possible but difficult to prove that some of the performance differences are due to the linear interpolation used as part of the hypercube method between conditions available in the event catalogue the neural network in comparison can include non linear relationships which may offer a marginal improvement in performance 4 2 2 neural network approach 2 the neural network approach 2 closely matches the swan model although some deviation can be observed neural network approach 2 showed less scatter even than the swan model used to develop it this may be due to some generalisations being made within the weights of the neural network performance of the neural network models using similar approaches broadly matches that found in gracia et al 2021 and james et al 2017 for significant wave height suggesting that for predicting wave height this approach is suitable performance for tp was comparable with that of the swan model with again obvious patterning appearing in fig 10 due to the limited spectral bins in the wave observations however one outlier is this approaches performance for predicting dp in table 6 the bias in particular deviates considerably compared to other approaches this could be related to rapid and large changes in dp over time which may be a result of a multi modal sea state and because this approach incorporates information from previous time steps in fig 8 the model is not able to predict large jumps in direction well this may be explained by under or over fitting however performance of other parameters suggests this is not the case 4 2 3 neural network approach 3 neural network approach 3 seems to match the range of the observations well in fig 6 and particularly with regard to tp 7 this is expected as it has more information than the other two approaches similar findings are present in fig 9 and table 5 the skill metrics should be considered with some scepticism given the differences in binning discussed in section 3 2 it is also assumed that some bias correction more applicable for tp is incorporated into the weights of the neural network that generally improve performance the skill metrics suggest that overall this approach when compared with observations slightly out performs some of the others as it includes observations by its nature it has access to more information and therefore is likely to have an advantage over the others however deviations do occur from all the other models and observations particularly between the 13 07 2021 and 17 03 2021 this may be to do with the introduction of noise like data points in the source observational data for example the fluctuation of data points especially associated with sudden and sharp changes which could be an indication of a multi modal sea state for parameters derived from the spectral peak in particular noisy data can impact machine learning model performance gupta and gupta 2019 typically wave observational data is noisier than modelled due to a variety of reasons including instrument noise local wind effects and signal issues smit et al 2021 incorporating observations can also be challenging when being deployed operationally as the approach is reliant on observational data being available without it this model could not make predictions 4 3 computational efficiency average run times in table 7 provides a broad comparison in terms of real world time to run offshore conditions to nearshore conditions the significant computational performance difference between the data driven and process driven methods is consistent with other findings james et al 2017 reikard and rogers 2011 whilst on small scales such as applied here the differences in run times are relatively small these and other results in the literature suggests significant computational efficiency with the data driven approaches even when scaling them up to much larger domains this could allow compute time for other things such as additional runs to develop ensembles such attributes may be an appealing consideration when deploying an operational forecasting model or looking to downscale a large number of conditions however run times could potentially be improved for the process based model with more computational power 4 4 applicability and effort based on each of the different approaches applied here and in the wider literature it is possible discuss the applicability and effort required broadly for each approach swan and other process based models have some strengths and weaknesses compared with data driven approaches when considering applicability and development effort process based models have some inherent benefits they are well understood and typically errors with them can be diagnosed they have an inherent understanding of the physics of the processes they are attempting to model and therefore are more likely to produce sensible results but they can be computationally expensive and have some specific data requirements such as the availability of good bathymetric information on the other hand data driven models can be extremely computationally efficient once training is completed as discussed in section 4 3 they can be applied without bathymetric or other geographic information making it possible to make a large number of predictions quickly it is also possible to apply them either to compliment or as a replacement to process based models however they have significant data requirements to develop them such as the need for a reasonable set of conditions to be trained on two different approaches to this have been described here they also do not have an inherent understanding of the physical processes meaning that if they are developed using limited or poor data predictions may be spurious furthermore generalisation is a risk when scaling some data driven approaches which will need to be considered if approaches like those applied here were expanded to incorporate a large geographical region often regional differences in performance can exist as shown by gracia et al 2021 4 5 limitations in order to provide a fair comparison a single peak parameterised jonswap spectrum was used hasselmann et al 1973 this was to ensure consistency between the approaches the hypercube can only be constructed from parameterised wave data it therefore made sense to apply a similar limitation to the other methods to allow for a more direct comparison this limitation is likely to particularly affect performance during multi model sea states particularly when swell and sea conditions have similar energy using this simplified parameterised spectrum approach is a key limitation of the hypercube and the machine learning models trained using the same catalogue of events as is the swan model used to develop this catalogue of events the performance of those methods is therefore likely to approximate the performance of the swan model any biases or other limitations in the swan model are likely to impact the performance of methods that use data from it the hypercube in particular is further limited in that it is applied using an alongshore uniform offshore boundary this means that a single offshore set of conditions might be used to describe a large geographic area in this case this limitation was applied to the other approaches for consistency without this limitation it is possible that further improvements in performance may be achieve by the other approaches approach 3 has an advantage over some of the other approaches as the neural network can be trained using observational data directly however this approach itself has an additional limitation in that it is only applicable where observational data is available spatially and temporally therefore its applicability is limited to specific points of regions some literature is available on assimilating observational data into a forecasting work flow smit et al 2021 but further exploration is likely warranted other considerations for using point based observational data includes processing of errors and defining a geographic area where observations are applicable other potential methodologies to improve the results and overcome the parameterised spectrum limitation could be through the use of the complete wave spectrum as opposed to parameters derived from the spectrum as used in this paper this would drastically increase the available data for data driven methods to be trained with and could be used to lessen the influence of the differences in spectral discretisation between the model and the observed data 5 conclusions neural network approaches seem to marginally outperform the hypercube in both accuracy and efficiency although it is possible this is partly due to the way in which the hypercube generalises the wave parameters and further refining could further reduce the differences however the neural network approaches do have some other distinct advantages such as flexibility of application either through a data catalogue or time series type approach one of the key advantages demonstrated with this methodology is the neural networks ability to train directly on observed data offering comparable performance without the need to develop a high resolution process based model when predicting conditions at locations that have observations all the methods have similar limitations around the availability of data to develop them some process based models can provide estimates of wave conditions with very limited observational data to calibrate them though the quality of such results could be drawn into question whilst all the data driven approaches used here suffered from similar limitations around data availability and were reliant on a process based model to generate the data needed to develop them this extends to neural network approach 3 as the offshore wave information is sourced from a process based model the neural network approaches showed significant computationally efficiency when compared with the process driven approach similar to findings in james et al 2017 this has some considerable implications when considering deploying an operational model where run times and computational performance are more important additionally data driven approaches with similar numerical performance to process based models could be used to facilitate far more computationally efficient ensemble predictions however critically data driven models are particularly reliant on the quality and quantity of data to develop them in some cases
