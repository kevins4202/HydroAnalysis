10330,plastic film mulching pfm can increase or stabilize crop yields worldwide when applied to agricultural planting systems especially in arid and semi arid areas although the adverse effects that are caused by residual plastic film such as plastic pollution are becoming a global concern the application of pfm will not be replaced by other materials in the short term in agriculture it is important to understand the various pfm patterns different mulching periods and coverage rates that impact on soil physicochemical properties and characteristics of crop growth therefore based on a field experiment that we established in 2002 we conducted consecutive field observations from 2013 to 2016 to determine the optimum pfm mulching period and coverage rate three mulching periods were included i summer fallow period fm ii growth period gm and iii whole growth year wm two coverage rates were included i 50 half mulching hm and ii 100 total mulching tm that is there were six different pfm treatments no mulching nm over the growth years was considered the ck treatment pfm increased canopy height and leaf area index of winter wheat triticum aestivum l in the growing season by 29 5 and 19 4 respectively average winter wheat grain yields of various pfm patterns were 5318 5 kg ha 1 and 4557 7 kg ha 1 in 2013 2014 and 2015 2016 respectively these yields were 13 8 and 23 7 higher than nm in 2013 2014 and 2015 2016 respectively however the difference in the growth characteristics and grain yield of winter wheat under various pfm patterns resulted from the change in the mulching period and coverage rate winter wheat grain yield and biomass increased with gm and wm compared with fm and nm in normal rainfall years pfm coverage rates improved yield significantly p 0 05 and influenced soil nutrient concentrations hm maintained or increased soil organic matter som and total nitrogen concentrations but tm decreased som concentration by 8 3 water use efficiency wue and rainfall use efficiency rue were improved by various pfm patterns furthermore wm had the most significant impact on som concentrations gm was second and fm was minor considering the costs and benefits of pfm patterns the half coverage rate of pfm during the whole year fwh had the best index bi value and the total coverage rate of pfm during the growth period fgt and the half coverage rate of pfm during the growth period fgh had higher bi values than other pfm patterns the values for bi for fwh fgt and fgh were 10 3 8 9 and 8 5 respectively in conclusion ignoring the amount of pfm pollution in the environment or use biodegradable film instead of polyethylene film fwh was the best pfm pattern with the highest wue and rue in dryland rainfed agriculture but to decrease the amount of pfm application and pollution fgh was more beneficial for soil health with a low coverage rate and short mulching period fgh was the optimal pattern for pfm when applied to winter wheat on the loess plateau china based on our field experiment keywords mulching period coverage rate summer fallow period water use efficiency best index 1 introduction global food demand is growing continuously tilman et al 2011 and the food and agriculture organization fao suggested that crop grain production must increase by more than 1 4 times in 2050 to meet the growing human population and the increased need for animal feed bruinsma 2009 plastic film mulching pfm technology is one of the most effective strategies to increase yield worldwide lobell and field 2007 kasirajan and ngouajio 2012a 2012b gan et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 it has been applied widely in agricultural practice especially in cold arid and semi arid regions gao et al 2019 gan et al 2013 china is the largest user of pfm technology in the world gao et al 2019 daryanto et al 2017 and the application i e amount cover area regions and density of the material used of pfm technology has increased rapidly in recent decades the amount of pfm applied to crops has increased dramatically from about 6 mt to 1470 mt from 1982 to 2017 which is an increase 200 times in 35 y liu et al 2014 gao et al 2019 meanwhile there is a continuous tendency to increase the application of pfm in future agricultural development additionally the crop area covered by pfm has also expanded and the regions that use pfm have been extended from arid and semi arid regions in the north to high altitude areas with cold weather in the south of china gao et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the area of pfm increased from about 11 7 104 ha to 18 7 106 ha from 1982 to 2017 the density of pfm that is utilized increased 3 10 times i e the application rate reached 34 8 kg ha 1 in xingjiang province in the northwest of china in 2011 from 1991 to 2011 yan et al 2014 covered crops have also been expanded from cash crops to staple foods yan et al 2014 gao et al 2019 applying pfm technology has produced substantial economic benefits increased grain yield and eased the pressure on global food supply numerous studies have shown that pfm increased crop yield by 20 50 liu et al 2014 gan et al 2013 gao et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 using a global meta analysis zhang et al 2020 found that pfm benefited yield for both cash and cereal crops by increasing immediate season yield an average of 25 42 compared with no mulching gao et al 2019 also reported that average grain yield of the four major crops i e zea mays l triticum aestivum l anemone vitifolia buch l and solanum tuberosum l increased by 24 3 when pfm technology was applied in most cases n 1839 but a few cases n 221 showed a significant reduction of 16 1 in average grain yield thus pfm plays a vital role in ensuring food security in china and in the global food supply improvements in grain yield from pfm technology varied with different regions gao et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 2020 pfm increased yields by 32 6 29 6 23 1 20 6 17 0 and 4 7 in central northwest eastern north northeast and southwest china respectively gao et al 2019 moreover the distribution of rainfall significantly changed the yield increasing effect of pfm technology in dryland agriculture pfm systems typically have increased yields of 50 100 30 90 and 10 40 in a dry year normal rainfall year and wet rainfall year respectively compared with the same crops grown under control zhang et al 2013 various pfm materials i e polyethylene plastic film bio degradable film and liquid film and patterns i e different mulching periods and coverage rates have been applied in agricultural practices gan et al 2013 kasirajan and ngouajio 2012a 2012b some studies have shown that bio degradable film and liquid film have a smaller negative impact on the soil environment however there are no large scale applications because it is expensive and had less effect on increasing yields the mulching period and coverage rate by pfm are usually the major factors that affect regional grain yields because a large proportion of pfm is used during the growing season for crops mulching during the fallow period has been ignored he et al 2016b the summer fallow period is a vital period for recharging soil water that was consumed by the winter wheat during the last growing season in arid and semi arid agricultural regions he et al 2016a zhang et al 2020 there is an emerging consensus that there is a significant correlation between soil water storage in the profile 0 300 cm before sowing and winter wheat grain yield he et al 2016b full surface coverage i e coverage rate of 100 with no soil surface exposure is beneficial to crop growth and yield in the short term this pfm pattern reduces inefficient soil evaporation e provides better root growth and beneficial microbial survival li et al 2004 and promotes the uptake of water and nutrients however continuous use of pfm in the long term may increase consumption of water and nutrients by crops and result in more residual plastic fragments zhang et al 2020 continuous use pfm may lead to excessive water consumption in the soil profile that forms a dry layer which affects sustainable development in agricultural areas where irrigation is limited partial surface coverage i e coverage rate between 0 and 100 is used to enlarge the proportion of the bare area where planting occurs the same planting density in agricultural regions is maintained with reasonably high planting density in the covered area to ensure food supply increase rainfall infiltration reduce water and nutrient consumption and reduce the application and residue of pfm the agricultural white revolution of pfm technology may also bring white pollution liu et al 2014 between 1950 and 2015 about 4900 mt of mostly non biodegradable plastic waste was produced which is 60 of all plastic ever produced with the application of pfm technology a considerable part of that plastic film residue was brought into farmland ecosystems geyer et al 2017 because of nearly 30 y of application of pfm technology and lack of awareness of plastic residue in china plastic residues in soil have reached 71 9 259 1 kg ha 1 in the northwest farmland of the loess plateau and the wind sand area of the northeast yan et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 residual plastic pollution i e micro plastics or nano plastics in soils are global health concerns given its prevalence in terrestrial ecosystems zhang et al 2020 in particular submicrometre plastics were taken up by crops through a crack entry mode and this seriously threatened human health and the ecological environment once micro plastics or nano plastics entered the food chain rillig and lehmann 2020 li et al 2020 because global climate change increases stress on water resources the existence of limited arable land area increasing food demand by humans and increasing drought potential in semi arid and arid regions pfm use will increase continuously zhang et al 2020 although there have been several recent studies that searched for plastic Ô¨Ålm substitutes which included a technique that used biodegradable plastic Ô¨Ålm and straw cover zhao et al 2019 there was no signiÔ¨Åcant increase in grain yield ren et al 2017 therefore polyethylene plastic film will continue to be used in agricultural production so it is urgent to decrease the application of plastic film and plastic residuals in agriculture winter wheat triticum aestivum l is one of the fundamental cereals and is ranked only after corn zea mays l and rice oryza sativa l in terms of amount of acreage planted it has deep roots and is relatively drought tolerant jin et al 2007 he et al 2016b xue et al 2019 and 75 is grown in semi arid and arid agricultural regions li 2004 he et al 2016a it covers an area of 4 3 million ha in northwest china which accounts for 56 of the total agricultural cultivatable area in china he et al 2016a xue et al 2019 li et al 2014 and it is a major source of grain and livestock feed on the loess plateau liu et al 2014 the loess plateau is a typical arid and semi arid rainfed agricultural region that is a crucial area of food production in northwestern china li 2004 he et al 2016b ma et al 2018 water resources are also stressed more seriously because global climate change has significant impacts on dryland cropping systems chmielewski et al 2004 surface water resources are unavailable for irrigation and the groundwater is too deep and sparse usually below 80 m to use for crops in this region zhang et al 2013 qiao et al 2018 rainfall is the only source of soil water supply in rain fed agricultural areas moreover low rainfall with uneven seasonal distribution and high soil evaporation e are typical characteristics of arid and semi arid areas gan et al 2013 which seriously affect the stability and the yield of crops zhang et al 2016 gan et al 2013 previous numerous studies have shown that about one third of the annual rainfall occurred during the growing season for winter wheat from october to next june and 60 annual rainfall occurred during the summer fallow period from july to september zhang et al 2013 he et al 2016b that is there is an asynchrony between the winter wheat growing season and rainfall distribution which greatly affects the growth of crops water supply and the formation of grain yield he et al 2016b hence the objective of the research was to optimize the pfm mulching period and coverage rate to increase regional water use efficiency and food production to reduce the application of plastic film and to reduce the negative effects of pfm on farmland ecosystems the research aimed i to compare and to evaluate the impact of various patterns of pfm on soil attributes and plant growth and ii to screen suitable patterns i e mulching period and coverage rate for rain fed agricultural production and for environmental sustainability based on previous research we proposed two hypotheses the first hypothesis h1 is that half mulching hm the coverage rate is 50 and total mulching tm the coverage rate is 100 pfm applications have significantly different effects on soil water content and nutrient conditions but not in grain yields it could be that because the former has a larger exposed area than the latter hm operates just like rain micro collection measures to promote water infiltration or evaporation secondly we hypothesized h2 that continuous pfm applications increased grain yield and wue and the wm i e mulching in the whole growth year group was better than gm i e mulching in the growth period and fm i e mulching in the summer fallow period groups the mulching period for pfm will result in better hydrothermal conditions in the soil increased rate of winter wheat emergence and plant growth and higher grain yields however pfm may decrease soil evaporation which helps to regulate evapotranspiration et 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site field experiments started in 2002 and all treatments were conducted continuously at changwu agro ecological experimental station on the loess plateau 35 14 n 107 40 e 1200 m above sea level changwu county shaanxi province china fig 1 the study site was located in a warm temperate semi humid

within the top 100 cm topsoil and at 20 cm intervals within the bottom 200 cm subsoil although this field experiment was established in 2002 we did not collect data in a few years especially before 2015 for several reasons i e lack of fund support a detailed database began in 2015 2 3 2 determination of crop agronomic traits canopy height h and leaf area index lai of winter wheat were estimated

estimated in 2015 2016 but the database did not include data from 2013 to 2014 and 2014 2015 because we changed cultivars of winter wheat or the wheat was damaged by the hail 2 3 3 measurement of soil chemical properties soil samples from three replicates of each treatment were taken after the harvest late june 2016 with a hand operated soil auger to a depth of 20 cm roots were removed with forceps before chemical extraction nitrate no3 n was extracted from fresh soil with 2 mol l 1 kcl henriksen and selmer olsen 1970 2 mm and the concentration was measured using a spectrophotometer uv vis

the surface runoff the water table at the site was at a depth of about 50 80 m so upward flow into the root zone was negligible the downward drainage and runoff were assumed to be negligible to a depth of 300 cm because the experimental field was flat and located in a semi arid region with low rainfall there was no runoff in the experiment and the field was not irrigated eq 2 was thus simplified as 3 e t e t r Œ¥ s w s wue kg ha 1 mm 1 and rue kg ha 1 mm 1 were calculated as in xie et al 2005 4 w u e y e t 5 r u e y r f r g where y is the grain yield kg ha 1 et is the total

microsoft corporation new mexico usa and origin 9 3 originlab corporation massachusetts usa 3 results 3 1 distribution of rainfall during different winter wheat growth periods in the decade from 2007 to 2017 a larger percentage of rainfall fell during the summer fallow season of winter wheat fig 1 average rainfall during the summer fallow period for winter wheat rf from july to september accounted for 58 9 11 2 307 2 mm of total rainfall r from july to next june lower proportions of 42 3 192 4 mm 2014 2015 and 47 8 197 4 mm 2015 2016 of rainfall fell during that period in some years during 2013 2014 a higher proportion of 59 8 392 2 mm fell during the summer fallow period rainfall during the period from the sowing of winter wheat to harvest rg was 38 4 12 4 of r with a higher proportion in 2013 2014 40 2 2014 2015 57 7 and 2015 2016 52 2 3 2 differences in soil physical properties with various pfm patterns soil physical properties such as soil bd k s and sc were affected significantly at harvest in 2016 under various pfm patterns fig 3 bd increased under all pfm patterns fig 3a fgt and fwt increased bd by 4 8 and 11 2 more than nm respectively under the same coverage rate of pfm the effect of wm and gm on bd was greater than fm and nm in the different mulching periods hm had a weaker impact on soil bd than tm ks decreased under various pfm patterns fig 3b ffh fgh fwt and fgt decreased ks by 23 1 26 9 34 6 and 50 0 more than nm respectively p 0 05 but fft and fwh decreased ks by 15 4 and 11 5 more than nm respectively p 0 05 fm had minimal impact on k s compared with gm and wm under various pfm patterns ffh fgh and fwt had higher sc than nm but fgt decreased sc fig 3c 3 3 changes in soil chemical nutrients and attribution under various pfm patterns key soil nutrients concentrations changed significantly in the tillage layer 0 20 cm after various continuous pfm patterns were applied for 15 y from 2002 to 2016 and the average concentration of soil nutrients during 2013 2016 was highly variable under different pfm patterns table 1 som concentration was 7 7 and 11 0 higher under fgh and ffh respectively and 6 9 and 8 3 lower under fft and fwt respectively compared with nm p 0 05 meanwhile total n and som concentrations showed similar trends total n concentration after the harvest was 6 7 and 18 9 higher under fgh and ffh respectively and 1 1 and 4 4 lower under fft and fwt than np p 0 05 respectively ammonium n concentration did not differ significantly among the treatments except under fft p 0 05 total p and available p concentrations did not differ significantly among treatments available k concentration in the 0 20 cm layer was 14 9 and 27 8 higher under fgh and ffh than under nm p 0 05 respectively only the ffh treatment had a significant effect on ph value in the 0 20 cm layer 3 4 growth characteristics and yield components of winter wheat under various pfm patterns various pfm patterns increased plant h and lai of winter wheat by 29 5 and 19 4 in 2015 2016 respectively the effects of fgt and fwt were outstanding fig 4 the mean percentage increase in winter wheat plant height was 28 5 during six different periods apr 14 29 may 5 12 29 jun 23 with all pfm patterns and the mean percentage increase in winter wheat lai during five different periods apr 14 29 may 5 12 29 jun 23 was 19 4 with all pfm patterns during harvest plant h had increased by 4 2 2 3 9 5 p 0 05 13 7 p 0 05 7 6 and 12 7 p 0 05 under ffh fft fgh fgt fwh and fwt respectively fig 4a gm and wm had a better effect on plant h than fm and nm under different pfm mulching periods lai increased under various pfm patterns before the filling stage of winter wheat although lai under fgt and fwt was better than under nm fig 4b compared with nm fm had almost no effect on lai in winter wheat during different pfm mulching periods the spike length of winter wheat barely changed under various pfm patterns fft fgt fwh and fwt increased spike number by 5 105 6 105 7 105 and 5 105 per hectare compared with nm respectively table 2 3 5 soil water consumption under various pfm patterns mean soil water content in the 300 cm profile of the winter wheat field was the highest during the wintering period in 2015 2016 but lowest during the harvest period when the soil was the driest fig 5 before winter wheat sowing the average soil water content of the upper layer 0 150 cm was higher than the lower layer 150 300 cm in the entire profile under various pfm treatments in contrast the upper layer was drier than the lower layer during harvest and soil water content decreased sharply during harvest compared with the planting season the soil water content curves during sowing and harvest showed an intersection point of about 300 cm but the intersection of fgt was obviously 300 cm most pfm patterns increased soil water storage in the 0 300 cm profile sws300 during the sowing stage of winter wheat but decreased storage during harvest partial pfm patterns increased et and all pfm patterns improved wue and rue table 3 before winter wheat sowing sws300 under the fwt treatment decreased by 24 mm 3 3 more than nm but the sws300 of other pfm treatments was higher than that of nm during harvest sws300 decreased significantly compared with that during sowing fgt had the lowest sws300 among the pfm patterns but fgh and ffh still maintained a high sws300 various pfm patterns also increased et and et under fgt and fwh was significantly higher than nm p 0 05 wue increased under various pfm patterns and the highest wue value was 10 2 kg mm 1 ha 1 under fwh and wue was 10 1 kg mm 1 ha 1 and 9 1 kg mm 1 ha 1 under fwt and fgh respectively rue increased under all pfm treatments fwh fgt fwt fft fgh and ffh increased rue by 40 4 31 1 20 5 15 2 12 6 and 8 6 compared with nm respectively table 3 3 6 grain yield and dry biomass the grain yield and dry biomass of winter wheat increased under various pfm patterns if they did not suffer from natural disasters fig 6 the average grain yield of winter wheat under various pfm treatments in 2013 2014 was 5318 5 kg ha 1 yield of nm was 4674 1 kg ha 1 therefore there was an average yield increase of 13 8 under pfm treatments ffh fwt and fgh treatments increased grain yield by 18 7 15 8 and 14 8 respectively the aboveground dry biomass of winter wheat improved significantly under pfm patterns and the dry biomass under fwt increased by 1409 0 kg ha 1 15 1 grain yield and dry biomass decreased sharply compared with normal years because of the hail disaster during the filling period of winter wheat in 2014 2015 nevertheless compared with nm fm increased grain yield by 9 5 under the different mulching periods but gm and wm almost reduced grain yield under different pfm coverage rates grain yield and biomass decreased more severely under hm but fgh and fwh reduced grain yield by 20 5 and 23 2 compared with nm respectively and biomass also showed a consistent decreasing trend grain yield of winter wheat in 2015 2016 was 3684 6 5720 3 kg ha 1 which increased under the various pfm patterns grain yield under fwh and fgt was 5270 3 and 4920 6 kg ha 1 respectively which was an increase of 43 0 and 33 5 compared with nm p 0 05 respectively fwh and fgt treatments also exhibited higher yield of dry biomass than other treatments of 10 489 4 kg ha 1and 9727 2 kg ha 1 respectively which were increased of 42 9 and 32 5 compared with nm respectively 4 discussion 4 1 change in physical and chemical properties of soil under pfm physical properties of soil in the tillage layer changed at the end of the growing season under pfm technology field surface management but more changes came from human disturbance e g tillage planting etc under the same human disturbance soil bd changed during harvest during different mulching periods of pfm after a year of winter wheat growth bd increased under wm and gm but the change in bd was not significant under fm in other words bd of the tillage layer of soil changed during harvest when pfm was applied during the growing season compared with the deeper layer soil bd of the tillage layer was more susceptible to external factors for example alternating drying and wetting changed soil bd significantly in the tillage layer especially after a heavy rainfall bd in the soil increased in the short term the tillage layer of the soil was compacted when rainfall intensity was higher than the infiltration rate of rainwater the original soil mass increased with rainwater and the soil of the tillage layer was compacted and soil bd increased and the compaction under pfm was higher than np pfm acted like an obstacle for rainwater infiltration which allowed rainwater to enter the soil only through the mulch gap therefore the infiltration rate of rainwater and cumulative infiltration in pfm treatments were smaller than np more water remained on the membrane or in the soil of the tillage layer which resulted in greater compaction of the soil under pfm and increased bd that was greater than np the wet dry cycle was long and complicated with repeated freezing and thawing of the soil from sowing to the harvest of winter wheat as a result bd increased during the harvest moreover rainfall and soil texture were also important factors that affected soil bd in dryland farming rainfall directly affected the wet dry cycle and soil texture determined the expansion and contraction of the soil which affected the soil compaction process and changed the soil bd under the different pfm mulching periods neither fm nor nm was covered with plastic film during the growth period of winter wheat therefore soil bd did not change significantly during harvest but plastic film was applied to both wm and gm during the growth period and so bd increased under different pfm coverage rates hm of the exposed area was still 50 coverage water and air were lost from the uncovered area and the compaction from water accumulation under the membrane was weakened which eventually reduced its impact on bd pfm changed soil bd during different stages of crop growth wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 with similar soil texture in dryland agricultural areas rainfall is an important factor that affects bd wang et al 2017 reported that a 7 y continuous application of pfm increased soil bd by 5 during maize harvest in yuzhong silt loam texture 0 0002 mm 22 0 22 1 mean annual rainfall 388 mm and pfm increased bd by 6 during maize harvest in huining silt loam texture 0 0002 mm 22 0 22 1 mean annual rainfall 410 mm larger rainfall had a greater effect on soil bd during different growth periods of corn soil bd increased gradually with the increase in rainfall and the process of the wet and dry cycles pfm increased bd gradually from may to a high in november in the ferric acrisol rain fed region with crop rotation silt loam texture 0 0002 mm 40 mean annual rainfall 879 mm zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 showed that pfm had the largest soil bd in nm with straw mulching in erodible loess soil however some studies showed different results subrahmaniyan et al 2018 reported that fwt treatment decreased soil bd in a 3 y experiment anikwe et al 2007 showed that there was no significant difference in pfm or nm but pfm decreased soil bd slightly after many years of pfm application residual plastic fragments and its degraded micro plastics or nano plastics promoted soil clay to be cemented together compacted soil under machinery reduced f cut off pore connectivity and increased bd jiang et al 2017 ng et al 2018 in some studies the accumulation of residual fragments after many years reduced soil bd therefore the amount of plastic film residue can change bd in addition almost all studies have shown that pfm reduced k s significantly due to residual fragments which cut off pore connectivity of the soil and reduced water conducting pores pfm significantly reduced ks and affected infiltration and recharge of rainwater jiang et al 2017 ng et al 2018 soil physical and hydraulic properties were degraded gradually with plastic film fragments removing the plastic residue decreased the adverse effect on the soil environment li et al 1999 hence it is advantageous to use new degradable materials instead of traditional polyethylene plastic film to maintain soil health kasirajan and ngouajio 2012a 2012b ng et al 2018 soil nutrients and ph were affected by the cumulative effect with a variety of continuous pfm patterns applied for 10 years this difference will be more obvious as the number of application years of various pfm patterns increase in detail the coverage rate of pfm or bare surface area changed the som concentration by affecting the soil s physical and biochemical processes som concentration was maintained or increased by hm but reduced by tm zhang et al 2017 suggested that pfm did not necessarily lead to a decrease in som in the long term especially in regions with poor water and high heat inconsistently pfm reduced som concentration in the northeast of china with more rainfall than on the loess plateau li et al 2007 pfm coverage rates changed som concentrations zhang et al 2015 tm with no exposed surface area significantly reduced water heat and gas exchange processes between the soil and atmosphere interface zhou et al 2020 which led to soil water content temperature and co2 concentrations that were higher than under hm or nm this stimulated soil microorganisms and enzymatic activity to break down a large amount of humus an important component of som into small molecules mo et al 2017 wang et al 2016 simultaneously a better hydrothermal environment promoted microorganisms and fungi to use these molecules i e secretions contained protein and carbohydrates to multiply and to promote the decomposition of som for the absorption and utilization by roots zhu et al 2018 finally increasing soil respiration microbial and root respiration ultimately increased som and nutrient consumption which resulted in mineralization of som that was faster than other treatments pfm regulated soil temperature and promoted crop growth when it was cold in early spring he et al 2016b zhou et al 2009 and our results indicated that various pfm patterns increased lai and h in april early spring fig 4 pfm improved hydrothermal conditions in the rhizosphere micro environment of winter wheat and winter wheat grew better under these treatments gan et al 2013 but the better hydrothermal environment promoted the mineralization of som however small plants did not consume som much during cold weather during the stage of the rapid growth of winter wheat after the jointing stage h and lai of winter wheat increased rapidly more solar radiation was trapped in the winter wheat canopy the larger lai was beneficial for crop photosynthesis and t promoted the absorption and utilization of soil water content and other nutrients by increasing plant roots especially under fgt and fwt treatments better lai and h led to decomposition of som during the summer fallow period crop residues were plowed into the tillage layer with high temperatures and frequent rainfall hydrothermal conditions under gm fm and wm were better than under nm gan et al 2013 fan et al 2016 which was beneficial to the residual mineralization of winter wheat roots and increased the decomposition of microorganisms niu et al 2004 as our first hypothesis h1 hm had higher som and higher total n concentrations than tm during the same mulching period the no3 n was easily leached with rainfall ma et al 2018 zhang et al 2012 mulching during the summer fallow period reduced rainwater leaching and finally caused the nutrient accumulation in the plow layer to be higher than during other mulching periods 4 2 consumption and depletion of soil water resources consumption of limited water resources directly affected crop yields and land productivity he et al 2016a there is an emerging consensus that pfm reduces soil e li et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 the micro environmental hydrothermal conditions in the soil rhizosphere were improved by pfm which may have promoted crop growth and increased crop t so pfm significantly reduced soil e and promoted crop t gan et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 under the same pattern of rainfall distribution et will eventually be different under various pfm after 10 y of application of pfm technology and with the consumption and depletion of soil water the differences in soil water consumption of various pfm patterns became apparent during 2015 2016 after pfm had been applied for 15 y however it has not been possible to quantify the proportion of pfm that affected e and t using the water balance equation xie et al 2005 the impact on et varied depending on factors such as pfm coverage rates and mulching periods there was no doubt that tm reduced more soil e than hm or nm meanwhile soil e was also affected by various pfm mulching periods and there was excessive soil e with high temperatures and intensive rainfall during the summer fallow period for winter wheat although the summer fallow period only accounted for 1 4 of the winter wheat growing year a large proportion of soil e was attributed to et during the growth period during the whole growth year for winter wheat therefore soil e decreased significantly when the plastic film was applied in fm and wm treatments and there was no crop t during this period the more intense crop t resulted from the higher crop h and lai during the growth period and fwt and fgt had higher crop t than other pfm treatments fgt treatment had no mulching cover during the summer fallow period of high temperatures and strong e which resulted in its maximum et on the contrary fwt was mulched during the summer fallow period which reduced strong soil e and et was the least gan et al 2013 excessive soil e affected et substantially and accounted for a large proportion during the summer fallow period another reason for this result was that continuous fwt mulching resulted in soil desiccation in the deeper layer fig 5 that restored less water in the profile table 3 under various pfm patterns wue and rue increased turner 2004 because the exposed area of soil was reduced with different mulching periods and coverage rates this reduced surface e and increased the effective crop t this resulted in increased wue wang et al 2009 the trend in wue was the same as h2 under different mulching periods but our results were not completely consistent with h2 fgt had excessive soil e promoted crop growth and increased crop t which led to significantly higher et than other treatments even if grain yield of winter wheat increased but wue was not changed significantly hence this minimized soil e on the soil surface and improved crop t zhang et al 2018 the soil water consumption depth of fwt was deeper than other treatments to meet the soil water consumption of winter wheat growth which may lead to soil desiccation and a permanent dry layer may form in severe cases the dry soil layer indicated that it was not conducive to the sustainable use of water in water limited regions he et al 2016b suggested that fgh did not affect et significantly in yearly averages 2009 2014 on the loess plateau but it increased the et by 6 and 10 during the dry growing seasons of 2009 2010 and 2010 2011 respectively 4 3 yield and biomass most pfm patterns had a positive effect on grain yield and biomass of winter wheat li et al 2001 winter wheat is sown in late september and it is harvested in middle or late june of the following year which is a growth period 9 mo this is a longer growing period than other crops which resulted in complex and long term physical chemical and biochemical processes during the formation of grain yield and biomass a 5 y experiment showed that the fgh treatment increased grain yield in most years from 2008 to 2013 on the loess plateau he et al 2016b especially in normal dry years but in extremely dry years pfm may even reduce grain yields he et al 2016b a meta analysis of pfm in northwestern china indicated that pfm increased grain yield of potatoes solanum tuberosum l corn and wheat by 43 1 compared with traditional cultivation and it increased grain yield of winter wheat by 19 8 ma et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 suggested that hm increased grain yield of winter wheat on the loess plateau significantly abundant rainfall in the summer fallow period or higher soil water storage at sowing time was accompanied by higher grain yield zhang et al 2013 therefore soil water supply for winter wheat growth was one of the key factors that increased or stabilized grain yield and biomass gan et al 2013 also nutrient supply was a limiting factor for wheat production in arid and semi arid barren regions related research indicated that grain yield of winter wheat might be reduced with insufficient nitrogen fertilizer n northwestern china he et al 2016a under the same pfm mulching period different soil water content and temperatures caused by the various pfm patterns changed the effective tiller emergence of winter wheat and resulted in differences in grain yield and biomass nevertheless pfm does not always have a positive effect on grain yield of winter wheat and adverse effects may be observed under extreme weather events e g persistent drought hail and storms etc extreme weather events will have irreversible impacts on the grain yield of crops for example grain yield under hm treatment was reduced significantly due to hail during the grain filling period in 2015 4 4 economic benefits eb and the best index bi under various pfm patterns because eb is still the primary concern of households and farmers in developing countries the input output ratio is also crucial to them he et al 2018 by taking the costs of various inputs mulching materials for pfm into consideration eb was calculated for evaluating various pfm patterns regardless of the year of a natural disaster the eb of fgh ffh and fwh was better under various pfm treatments fig 7a at present the key to the sustainable agricultural crisis is that the direct eb of farmers is not necessarily consistent with our common interests to maintain the fertility of farmland soil health numerous experts and scholars are committed to producing more grain yield with lower environmental costs zhang et al 2016 yao et al 2018 thus minimizing the negative impact of pfm on the soil s physical chemical and biological properties maintaining soil health maximizing limited rainfall resources and increasing crop yield are future agricultural development trends chen et al 2014 bd ks som lai y rue and eb were chosen to calculate the best index bi and the bi values of fwh fgt and fgh were 10 3 8 9 and 8 5 respectively fig 7b using a biodegradable Ô¨Ålm or removing plastic film fragments may be options to increase bi and to minimize the negative effects of pfm on the soil environment ma et al 2018 5 conclusion significant differences were observed when field treatments were conducted for 10 y pfm has a negative influence on the physical properties of the soil s arable layer such as increased soil bd and reduced ks but pfm had a smaller impact under hm ffh fgh and fwh on bd and ks than tm fft fgt and fwt additionally hm maintained the concentrations of som and total n in the arable layer better than tm simultaneously the better lai and h of winter wheat occurred with gm fgh and fgt and wm fwh and fwt rather than sm ffh and fft or nm gm and wm had an outstanding positive impact on increasing the yield of winter wheat however fwt depleted the water in the 300 cm soil profile which promoted dry soils based on the bi value the top three pfm patterns were fwh 10 3 fgt 8 9 and fgh 8 5 therefore fwh and fgt were more suitable pfm patterns for reducing film pollution without using biodegradable film instead of polyethylene film fwh was the best pfm pattern because the plastic film reduced soil evaporation completely during the whole year to decrease the application of pfm as much as possible fgh was more beneficial to soil health due to its low coverage and short mulching period this treatment is the optimal pattern for applying pfm to winter wheat cultivation on the loess plateau and

10330,plastic film mulching pfm can increase or stabilize crop yields worldwide when applied to agricultural planting systems especially in arid and semi arid areas although the adverse effects that are caused by residual plastic film such as plastic pollution are becoming a global concern the application of pfm will not be replaced by other materials in the short term in agriculture it is important to understand the various pfm patterns different mulching periods and coverage rates that impact on soil physicochemical properties and characteristics of crop growth therefore based on a field experiment that we established in 2002 we conducted consecutive field observations from 2013 to 2016 to determine the optimum pfm mulching period and coverage rate three mulching periods were included i summer fallow period fm ii growth period gm and iii whole growth year wm two coverage rates were included i 50 half mulching hm and ii 100 total mulching tm that is there were six different pfm treatments no mulching nm over the growth years was considered the ck treatment pfm increased canopy height and leaf area index of winter wheat triticum aestivum l in the growing season by 29 5 and 19 4 respectively average winter wheat grain yields of various pfm patterns were 5318 5 kg ha 1 and 4557 7 kg ha 1 in 2013 2014 and 2015 2016 respectively these yields were 13 8 and 23 7 higher than nm in 2013 2014 and 2015 2016 respectively however the difference in the growth characteristics and grain yield of winter wheat under various pfm patterns resulted from the change in the mulching period and coverage rate winter wheat grain yield and biomass increased with gm and wm compared with fm and nm in normal rainfall years pfm coverage rates improved yield significantly p 0 05 and influenced soil nutrient concentrations hm maintained or increased soil organic matter som and total nitrogen concentrations but tm decreased som concentration by 8 3 water use efficiency wue and rainfall use efficiency rue were improved by various pfm patterns furthermore wm had the most significant impact on som concentrations gm was second and fm was minor considering the costs and benefits of pfm patterns the half coverage rate of pfm during the whole year fwh had the best index bi value and the total coverage rate of pfm during the growth period fgt and the half coverage rate of pfm during the growth period fgh had higher bi values than other pfm patterns the values for bi for fwh fgt and fgh were 10 3 8 9 and 8 5 respectively in conclusion ignoring the amount of pfm pollution in the environment or use biodegradable film instead of polyethylene film fwh was the best pfm pattern with the highest wue and rue in dryland rainfed agriculture but to decrease the amount of pfm application and pollution fgh was more beneficial for soil health with a low coverage rate and short mulching period fgh was the optimal pattern for pfm when applied to winter wheat on the loess plateau china based on our field experiment keywords mulching period coverage rate summer fallow period water use efficiency best index 1 introduction global food demand is growing continuously tilman et al 2011 and the food and agriculture organization fao suggested that crop grain production must increase by more than 1 4 times in 2050 to meet the growing human population and the increased need for animal feed bruinsma 2009 plastic film mulching pfm technology is one of the most effective strategies to increase yield worldwide lobell and field 2007 kasirajan and ngouajio 2012a 2012b gan et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 it has been applied widely in agricultural practice especially in cold arid and semi arid regions gao et al 2019 gan et al 2013 china is the largest user of pfm technology in the world gao et al 2019 daryanto et al 2017 and the application i e amount cover area regions and density of the material used of pfm technology has increased rapidly in recent decades the amount of pfm applied to crops has increased dramatically from about 6 mt to 1470 mt from 1982 to 2017 which is an increase 200 times in 35 y liu et al 2014 gao et al 2019 meanwhile there is a continuous tendency to increase the application of pfm in future agricultural development additionally the crop area covered by pfm has also expanded and the regions that use pfm have been extended from arid and semi arid regions in the north to high altitude areas with cold weather in the south of china gao et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the area of pfm increased from about 11 7 104 ha to 18 7 106 ha from 1982 to 2017 the density of pfm that is utilized increased 3 10 times i e the application rate reached 34 8 kg ha 1 in xingjiang province in the northwest of china in 2011 from 1991 to 2011 yan et al 2014 covered crops have also been expanded from cash crops to staple foods yan et al 2014 gao et al 2019 applying pfm technology has produced substantial economic benefits increased grain yield and eased the pressure on global food supply numerous studies have shown that pfm increased crop yield by 20 50 liu et al 2014 gan et al 2013 gao et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 using a global meta analysis zhang et al 2020 found that pfm benefited yield for both cash and cereal crops by increasing immediate season yield an average of 25 42 compared with no mulching gao et al 2019 also reported that average grain yield of the four major crops i e zea mays l triticum aestivum l anemone vitifolia buch l and solanum tuberosum l increased by 24 3 when pfm technology was applied in most cases n 1839 but a few cases n 221 showed a significant reduction of 16 1 in average grain yield thus pfm plays a vital role in ensuring food security in china and in the global food supply improvements in grain yield from pfm technology varied with different regions gao et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 2020 pfm increased yields by 32 6 29 6 23 1 20 6 17 0 and 4 7 in central northwest eastern north northeast and southwest china respectively gao et al 2019 moreover the distribution of rainfall significantly changed the yield increasing effect of pfm technology in dryland agriculture pfm systems typically have increased yields of 50 100 30 90 and 10 40 in a dry year normal rainfall year and wet rainfall year respectively compared with the same crops grown under control zhang et al 2013 various pfm materials i e polyethylene plastic film bio degradable film and liquid film and patterns i e different mulching periods and coverage rates have been applied in agricultural practices gan et al 2013 kasirajan and ngouajio 2012a 2012b some studies have shown that bio degradable film and liquid film have a smaller negative impact on the soil environment however there are no large scale applications because it is expensive and had less effect on increasing yields the mulching period and coverage rate by pfm are usually the major factors that affect regional grain yields because a large proportion of pfm is used during the growing season for crops mulching during the fallow period has been ignored he et al 2016b the summer fallow period is a vital period for recharging soil water that was consumed by the winter wheat during the last growing season in arid and semi arid agricultural regions he et al 2016a zhang et al 2020 there is an emerging consensus that there is a significant correlation between soil water storage in the profile 0 300 cm before sowing and winter wheat grain yield he et al 2016b full surface coverage i e coverage rate of 100 with no soil surface exposure is beneficial to crop growth and yield in the short term this pfm pattern reduces inefficient soil evaporation e provides better root growth and beneficial microbial survival li et al 2004 and promotes the uptake of water and nutrients however continuous use of pfm in the long term may increase consumption of water and nutrients by crops and result in more residual plastic fragments zhang et al 2020 continuous use pfm may lead to excessive water consumption in the soil profile that forms a dry layer which affects sustainable development in agricultural areas where irrigation is limited partial surface coverage i e coverage rate between 0 and 100 is used to enlarge the proportion of the bare area where planting occurs the same planting density in agricultural regions is maintained with reasonably high planting density in the covered area to ensure food supply increase rainfall infiltration reduce water and nutrient consumption and reduce the application and residue of pfm the agricultural white revolution of pfm technology may also bring white pollution liu et al 2014 between 1950 and 2015 about 4900 mt of mostly non biodegradable plastic waste was produced which is 60 of all plastic ever produced with the application of pfm technology a considerable part of that plastic film residue was brought into farmland ecosystems geyer et al 2017 because of nearly 30 y of application of pfm technology and lack of awareness of plastic residue in china plastic residues in soil have reached 71 9 259 1 kg ha 1 in the northwest farmland of the loess plateau and the wind sand area of the northeast yan et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 residual plastic pollution i e micro plastics or nano plastics in soils are global health concerns given its prevalence in terrestrial ecosystems zhang et al 2020 in particular submicrometre plastics were taken up by crops through a crack entry mode and this seriously threatened human health and the ecological environment once micro plastics or nano plastics entered the food chain rillig and lehmann 2020 li et al 2020 because global climate change increases stress on water resources the existence of limited arable land area increasing food demand by humans and increasing drought potential in semi arid and arid regions pfm use will increase continuously zhang et al 2020 although there have been several recent studies that searched for plastic Ô¨Ålm substitutes which included a technique that used biodegradable plastic Ô¨Ålm and straw cover zhao et al 2019 there was no signiÔ¨Åcant increase in grain yield ren et al 2017 therefore polyethylene plastic film will continue to be used in agricultural production so it is urgent to decrease the application of plastic film and plastic residuals in agriculture winter wheat triticum aestivum l is one of the fundamental cereals and is ranked only after corn zea mays l and rice oryza sativa l in terms of amount of acreage planted it has deep roots and is relatively drought tolerant jin et al 2007 he et al 2016b xue et al 2019 and 75 is grown in semi arid and arid agricultural regions li 2004 he et al 2016a it covers an area of 4 3 million ha in northwest china which accounts for 56 of the total agricultural cultivatable area in china he et al 2016a xue et al 2019 li et al 2014 and it is a major source of grain and livestock feed on the loess plateau liu et al 2014 the loess plateau is a typical arid and semi arid rainfed agricultural region that is a crucial area of food production in northwestern china li 2004 he et al 2016b ma et al 2018 water resources are also stressed more seriously because global climate change has significant impacts on dryland cropping systems chmielewski et al 2004 surface water resources are unavailable for irrigation and the groundwater is too deep and sparse usually below 80 m to use for crops in this region zhang et al 2013 qiao et al 2018 rainfall is the only source of soil water supply in rain fed agricultural areas moreover low rainfall with uneven seasonal distribution and high soil evaporation e are typical characteristics of arid and semi arid areas gan et al 2013 which seriously affect the stability and the yield of crops zhang et al 2016 gan et al 2013 previous numerous studies have shown that about one third of the annual rainfall occurred during the growing season for winter wheat from october to next june and 60 annual rainfall occurred during the summer fallow period from july to september zhang et al 2013 he et al 2016b that is there is an asynchrony between the winter wheat growing season and rainfall distribution which greatly affects the growth of crops water supply and the formation of grain yield he et al 2016b hence the objective of the research was to optimize the pfm mulching period and coverage rate to increase regional water use efficiency and food production to reduce the application of plastic film and to reduce the negative effects of pfm on farmland ecosystems the research aimed i to compare and to evaluate the impact of various patterns of pfm on soil attributes and plant growth and ii to screen suitable patterns i e mulching period and coverage rate for rain fed agricultural production and for environmental sustainability based on previous research we proposed two hypotheses the first hypothesis h1 is that half mulching hm the coverage rate is 50 and total mulching tm the coverage rate is 100 pfm applications have significantly different effects on soil water content and nutrient conditions but not in grain yields it could be that because the former has a larger exposed area than the latter hm operates just like rain micro collection measures to promote water infiltration or evaporation secondly we hypothesized h2 that continuous pfm applications increased grain yield and wue and the wm i e mulching in the whole growth year group was better than gm i e mulching in the growth period and fm i e mulching in the summer fallow period groups the mulching period for pfm will result in better hydrothermal conditions in the soil increased rate of winter wheat emergence and plant growth and higher grain yields however pfm may decrease soil evaporation which helps to regulate evapotranspiration et 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site field experiments started in 2002 and all treatments were conducted continuously at changwu agro ecological experimental station on the loess plateau 35 14 n 107 40 e 1200 m above sea level changwu county shaanxi province china fig 1 the study site was located in a warm temperate semi humid

estimated in 2015 2016 but the database did not include data from 2013 to 2014 and 2014 2015 because we changed cultivars of winter wheat or the wheat was damaged by the hail 2 3 3 measurement of soil chemical properties soil samples from three replicates of each treatment were taken after the harvest late june 2016 with a hand operated soil auger to a depth of 20 cm roots were removed with forceps

microsoft corporation new mexico usa and origin 9 3 originlab corporation massachusetts usa 3 results 3 1 distribution of rainfall during different winter wheat growth periods in the decade from 2007 to 2017 a larger percentage of rainfall fell during the summer fallow season of winter wheat fig 1 average rainfall during the summer fallow period for winter wheat rf from july to september accounted for 58 9 11 2 307 2 mm of total rainfall r from july to next june lower proportions of 42 3 192 4 mm 2014 2015 and 47 8 197 4 mm 2015 2016 of rainfall fell during that period in some years during 2013 2014 a higher proportion of 59 8 392 2 mm fell during the summer fallow period rainfall during the period from the sowing of winter wheat to harvest rg was 38 4 12 4 of r with a higher proportion in 2013 2014 40 2 2014 2015 57 7 and 2015 2016 52 2 3 2 differences in soil physical properties with various pfm patterns soil physical properties such as soil bd k s and sc were affected significantly at harvest in 2016 under various pfm patterns fig 3 bd increased under all pfm patterns fig 3a fgt and fwt increased bd by 4 8 and 11 2 more than nm respectively under the same coverage rate of pfm the effect of wm and gm on bd was greater than fm and nm in the different mulching periods hm had a weaker impact on soil bd than tm ks decreased under various pfm patterns fig 3b ffh fgh fwt and fgt decreased ks by 23 1 26 9 34 6 and 50 0 more than nm respectively p 0 05 but fft and fwh decreased ks by 15 4 and 11 5 more than nm respectively p 0 05 fm had minimal impact on k s compared with gm and wm under various pfm patterns ffh fgh and fwt had higher sc than nm but fgt decreased sc fig 3c 3 3 changes in soil chemical nutrients and attribution under various pfm patterns key soil nutrients concentrations changed significantly in the tillage layer 0 20 cm after various continuous pfm patterns were applied for 15 y from 2002 to 2016 and the average concentration of soil nutrients during 2013 2016 was highly variable under different pfm patterns table 1 som concentration was 7 7 and 11 0 higher under fgh and ffh respectively and 6 9 and 8 3 lower under fft and fwt respectively compared with nm p 0 05 meanwhile total n and som concentrations showed similar trends total n concentration after the harvest was 6 7 and 18 9 higher under fgh and ffh respectively and 1 1 and 4 4 lower under fft and fwt than np p 0 05 respectively ammonium n concentration did not differ significantly among the treatments except under fft p 0 05 total p and available p concentrations did not differ significantly among treatments available k concentration in the 0 20 cm layer was 14 9 and 27 8 higher under fgh and ffh than under nm p 0 05 respectively only the ffh treatment had a significant effect on ph value in the 0 20 cm layer 3 4 growth characteristics and yield components of winter wheat under various pfm patterns various pfm patterns increased plant h and lai of winter wheat by 29 5 and 19 4 in 2015 2016 respectively the effects of fgt and fwt were outstanding fig 4 the mean percentage increase in winter wheat plant height was 28 5 during six different periods apr 14 29 may 5 12 29 jun 23 with all pfm patterns and the mean percentage increase in winter wheat lai during five different periods apr 14 29 may 5 12 29 jun 23 was 19 4 with all pfm patterns during harvest plant h had increased by 4 2 2 3 9 5 p 0 05 13 7 p 0 05 7 6 and 12 7 p 0 05 under ffh fft fgh fgt fwh and fwt respectively fig 4a gm and wm had a better effect on plant h than fm and nm under different pfm mulching periods lai increased under various pfm patterns before the filling stage of winter wheat although lai under fgt and fwt was better than under nm fig 4b compared with nm fm had almost no effect on lai in winter wheat during different pfm mulching periods the spike length of winter wheat barely changed under various pfm patterns fft fgt fwh and fwt increased spike number by 5 105 6 105 7 105 and 5 105 per hectare compared with nm respectively table 2 3 5 soil water consumption under various pfm patterns mean soil water content in the 300 cm profile of the winter wheat field was the highest during the wintering period in 2015 2016 but lowest during the harvest period when the soil was the driest fig 5 before winter wheat sowing the average soil water content of the upper layer 0 150 cm was higher than the lower layer 150 300 cm in the entire profile under various pfm treatments in contrast the upper layer was drier than the lower layer during harvest and soil water content decreased sharply during harvest compared with the planting season the soil water content curves during sowing and harvest showed an intersection point of about 300 cm but the intersection of fgt was obviously 300 cm most pfm patterns increased soil water storage in the 0 300 cm profile sws300 during the sowing stage of winter wheat but decreased storage during harvest partial pfm patterns increased et and all pfm patterns improved wue and rue table 3 before winter wheat sowing sws300 under the fwt treatment decreased by 24 mm 3 3 more than nm but the sws300 of other pfm treatments was higher than that of nm during harvest sws300 decreased significantly compared with that during sowing fgt had the lowest sws300 among the pfm patterns but fgh and ffh still maintained a high sws300 various pfm patterns also increased et and et under fgt and fwh was significantly higher than nm p 0 05 wue increased under various pfm patterns and the highest wue value was 10 2 kg mm 1 ha 1 under fwh and wue was 10 1 kg mm 1 ha 1 and 9 1 kg mm 1 ha 1 under fwt and fgh respectively rue increased under all pfm treatments fwh fgt fwt fft fgh and ffh increased rue by 40 4 31 1 20 5 15 2 12 6 and 8 6 compared with nm respectively table 3 3 6 grain yield and dry biomass the grain yield and dry biomass of winter wheat increased under various pfm patterns if they did not suffer from natural disasters fig 6 the average grain yield of winter wheat under various pfm treatments in 2013 2014 was 5318 5 kg ha 1 yield of nm was 4674 1 kg ha 1 therefore there was an average yield increase of 13 8 under pfm treatments ffh fwt and fgh treatments increased grain yield by 18 7 15 8 and 14 8 respectively the aboveground dry biomass of winter wheat improved significantly under pfm patterns and the dry biomass under fwt increased by 1409 0 kg ha 1 15 1 grain yield and dry biomass decreased sharply compared with normal years because of the hail disaster during the filling period of winter wheat in 2014 2015 nevertheless compared with nm fm increased grain yield by 9 5 under the different mulching periods but gm and wm almost reduced grain yield under different pfm coverage rates grain yield and biomass decreased more severely under hm but fgh and fwh reduced grain yield by 20 5 and 23 2 compared with nm respectively and biomass also showed a consistent decreasing trend grain yield of winter wheat in 2015 2016 was 3684 6 5720 3 kg ha 1 which increased under the various pfm patterns grain yield under fwh and fgt was 5270 3 and 4920 6 kg ha 1 respectively which was an increase of 43 0 and 33 5 compared with nm p 0 05 respectively fwh and fgt treatments also exhibited higher yield of dry biomass than other treatments of 10 489 4 kg ha 1and 9727 2 kg ha 1 respectively which were increased of 42 9 and 32 5 compared with nm respectively 4 discussion 4 1 change in physical and chemical properties of soil under pfm physical properties of soil in the tillage layer changed at the end of the growing season under pfm technology field surface management but more changes came from human disturbance e g tillage planting etc under the same human disturbance soil bd changed during harvest during different mulching periods of pfm after a year of winter wheat growth bd increased under wm and gm but the change in bd was not significant under fm in other words bd of the tillage layer of soil changed during harvest when pfm was applied during the growing season compared with the deeper layer soil bd of the tillage layer was more susceptible to external factors for example alternating drying and wetting changed soil bd significantly in the tillage layer especially after a heavy rainfall bd in the soil increased in the short term the tillage layer of the soil was compacted when rainfall intensity was higher than the infiltration rate of rainwater the original soil mass increased with rainwater and the soil of the tillage layer was compacted and soil bd increased and the compaction under pfm was higher than np pfm acted like an obstacle for rainwater infiltration which allowed rainwater to enter the soil only through the mulch gap therefore the infiltration rate of rainwater and cumulative infiltration in pfm treatments were smaller than np more water remained on the membrane or in the soil of the tillage layer which resulted in greater compaction of the soil under pfm and increased bd that was greater than np the wet dry cycle was long and complicated with repeated freezing and thawing of the soil from sowing to the harvest of winter wheat as a result bd increased during the harvest moreover rainfall and soil texture were also important factors that affected soil bd in dryland farming rainfall directly affected the wet dry cycle and soil texture determined the expansion and contraction of the soil which affected the soil compaction process and changed the soil bd under the different pfm mulching periods neither fm nor nm was covered with plastic film during the growth period of winter wheat therefore soil bd did not change significantly during harvest but plastic film was applied to both wm and gm during the growth period and so bd increased under different pfm coverage rates hm of the exposed area was still 50 coverage water and air were lost from the uncovered area and the compaction from water accumulation under the membrane was weakened which eventually reduced its impact on bd pfm changed soil bd during different stages of crop growth wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 with similar soil texture in dryland agricultural areas rainfall is an important factor that affects bd wang et al 2017 reported that a 7 y continuous application of pfm increased soil bd by 5 during maize harvest in yuzhong silt loam texture 0 0002 mm 22 0 22 1 mean annual rainfall 388 mm and pfm increased bd by 6 during maize harvest in huining silt loam texture 0 0002 mm 22 0 22 1 mean annual rainfall 410 mm larger rainfall had a greater effect on soil bd during different growth periods of corn soil bd increased gradually with the increase in rainfall and the process of the wet and dry cycles pfm increased bd gradually from may to a high in november in the ferric acrisol rain fed region with crop rotation silt loam texture 0 0002 mm 40 mean annual rainfall 879 mm zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 showed that pfm had the largest soil bd in nm with straw mulching in erodible loess soil however some studies showed different results subrahmaniyan et al 2018 reported that fwt treatment decreased soil bd in a 3 y experiment anikwe et al 2007 showed that there was no significant difference in pfm or nm but pfm decreased soil bd slightly after many years of pfm application residual plastic fragments and its degraded micro plastics or nano plastics promoted soil clay to be cemented together compacted soil under machinery reduced f cut off pore connectivity and increased bd jiang et al 2017 ng et al 2018 in some studies the accumulation of residual fragments after many years reduced soil bd therefore the amount of plastic film residue can change bd in addition almost all studies have shown that pfm reduced k s significantly due to residual fragments which cut off pore connectivity of the soil and reduced water conducting pores pfm significantly reduced ks and affected infiltration and recharge of rainwater jiang et al 2017 ng et al 2018 soil physical and hydraulic properties were degraded gradually with plastic film fragments removing the plastic residue decreased the adverse effect on the soil environment li et al 1999 hence it is advantageous to use new degradable materials instead of traditional polyethylene plastic film to maintain soil health kasirajan and ngouajio 2012a 2012b ng et al 2018 soil nutrients and ph were affected by the cumulative effect with a variety of continuous pfm patterns applied for 10 years this difference will be more obvious as the number of application years of various pfm patterns increase in detail the coverage rate of pfm or bare surface area changed the som concentration by affecting the soil s physical and biochemical processes som concentration was maintained or increased by hm but reduced by tm zhang et al 2017 suggested that pfm did not necessarily lead to a decrease in som in the long term especially in regions with poor water and high heat inconsistently pfm reduced som concentration in the northeast of china with more rainfall than on the loess plateau li et al 2007 pfm coverage rates changed som concentrations zhang et al 2015 tm with no exposed surface area significantly reduced water heat and gas exchange processes between the soil and atmosphere interface zhou et al 2020 which led to soil water content temperature and co2 concentrations that were higher than under hm or nm this stimulated soil microorganisms and enzymatic activity to break down a large amount of humus an important component of som into small molecules mo et al 2017 wang et al 2016 simultaneously a better hydrothermal environment promoted microorganisms and fungi to use these molecules i e secretions contained protein and carbohydrates to multiply and to promote the decomposition of som for the absorption and utilization by roots zhu et al 2018 finally increasing soil respiration microbial and root respiration ultimately increased som and nutrient consumption which resulted in mineralization of som that was faster than other treatments pfm regulated soil temperature and promoted crop growth when it was cold in early spring he et al 2016b zhou et al 2009 and our results indicated that various pfm patterns increased lai and h in april early spring fig 4 pfm improved hydrothermal conditions in the rhizosphere micro environment of winter wheat and winter wheat grew better under these treatments gan et al 2013 but the better hydrothermal environment promoted the mineralization of som however small plants did not consume som much during cold weather during the stage of the rapid growth of winter wheat after the jointing stage h and lai of winter wheat increased rapidly more solar radiation was trapped in the winter wheat canopy the larger lai was beneficial for crop photosynthesis and t promoted the absorption and utilization of soil water content and other nutrients by increasing plant roots especially under fgt and fwt treatments better lai and h led to decomposition of som during the summer fallow period crop residues were plowed into the tillage layer with high temperatures and frequent rainfall hydrothermal conditions under gm fm and wm were better than under nm gan et al 2013 fan et al 2016 which was beneficial to the residual mineralization of winter wheat roots and increased the decomposition of microorganisms niu et al 2004 as our first hypothesis h1 hm had higher som and higher total n concentrations than tm during the same mulching period the no3 n was easily leached with rainfall ma et al 2018 zhang et al 2012 mulching during the summer fallow period reduced rainwater leaching and finally caused the nutrient accumulation in the plow layer to be higher than during other mulching periods 4 2 consumption and depletion of soil water resources consumption of limited water resources directly affected crop yields and land productivity he et al 2016a there is an emerging consensus that pfm reduces soil e li et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 the micro environmental hydrothermal conditions in the soil rhizosphere were improved by pfm which may have promoted crop growth and increased crop t so pfm significantly reduced soil e and promoted crop t gan et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 under the same pattern of rainfall distribution et will eventually be different under various pfm after 10 y of application of pfm technology and with the consumption and depletion of soil water the differences in soil water consumption of various pfm patterns became apparent during 2015 2016 after pfm had been applied for 15 y however it has not been possible to quantify the proportion of pfm that affected e and t using the water balance equation xie et al 2005 the impact on et varied depending on factors such as pfm coverage rates and mulching periods there was no doubt that tm reduced more soil e than hm or nm meanwhile soil e was also affected by various pfm mulching periods and there was excessive soil e with high temperatures and intensive rainfall during the summer fallow period for winter wheat although the summer fallow period only accounted for 1 4 of the winter wheat growing year a large proportion of soil e was attributed to et during the growth period during the whole growth year for winter wheat therefore soil e decreased significantly when the plastic film was applied in fm and wm treatments and there was no crop t during this period the more intense crop t resulted from the higher crop h and lai during the growth period and fwt and fgt had higher crop t than other pfm treatments fgt treatment had no mulching cover during the summer fallow period of high temperatures and strong e which resulted in its maximum et on the contrary fwt was mulched during the summer fallow period which reduced strong soil e and et was the least gan et al 2013 excessive soil e affected et substantially and accounted for a large proportion during the summer fallow period another reason for this result was that continuous fwt mulching resulted in soil desiccation in the deeper layer fig 5 that restored less water in the profile table 3 under various pfm patterns wue and rue increased turner 2004 because the exposed area of soil was reduced with different mulching periods and coverage rates this reduced surface e and increased the effective crop t this resulted in increased wue wang et al 2009 the trend in wue was the same as h2 under different mulching periods but our results were not completely consistent with h2 fgt had excessive soil e promoted crop growth and increased crop t which led to significantly higher et than other treatments even if grain yield of winter wheat increased but wue was not changed significantly hence this minimized soil e on the soil surface and improved crop t zhang et al 2018 the soil water consumption depth of fwt was deeper than other treatments to meet the soil water consumption of winter wheat growth which may lead to soil desiccation and a permanent dry layer may form in severe cases the dry soil layer indicated that it was not conducive to the sustainable use of water in water limited regions he et al 2016b suggested that fgh did not affect et significantly in yearly averages 2009 2014 on the loess plateau but it increased the et by 6 and 10 during the dry growing seasons of 2009 2010 and 2010 2011 respectively 4 3 yield and biomass most pfm patterns had a positive effect on grain yield and biomass of winter wheat li et al 2001 winter wheat is sown in late september and it is harvested in middle or late june of the following year which is a growth period 9 mo this is a longer growing period than other crops which resulted in complex and long term physical chemical and biochemical processes during the formation of grain yield and biomass a 5 y experiment showed that the fgh treatment increased grain yield in most years from 2008 to 2013 on the loess plateau he et al 2016b especially in normal dry years but in extremely dry years pfm may even reduce grain yields he et al 2016b a meta analysis of pfm in northwestern china indicated that pfm increased grain yield of potatoes solanum tuberosum l corn and wheat by 43 1 compared with traditional cultivation and it increased grain yield of winter wheat by 19 8 ma et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 suggested that hm increased grain yield of winter wheat on the loess plateau significantly abundant rainfall in the summer fallow period or higher soil water storage at sowing time was accompanied by higher grain yield zhang et al 2013 therefore soil water supply for winter wheat growth was one of the key factors that increased or stabilized grain yield and biomass gan et al 2013 also nutrient supply was a limiting factor for wheat production in arid and semi arid barren regions related research indicated that grain yield of winter wheat might be reduced with insufficient nitrogen fertilizer n northwestern china he et al 2016a under the same pfm mulching period different soil water content and temperatures caused by the various pfm patterns changed the effective tiller emergence of winter wheat and resulted in differences in grain yield and biomass nevertheless pfm does not always have a positive effect on grain yield of winter wheat and adverse effects may be observed under extreme weather events e g persistent drought hail and storms etc extreme weather events will have irreversible impacts on the grain yield of crops for example grain yield under hm treatment was reduced significantly due to hail during the grain filling period in 2015 4 4 economic benefits eb and the best index bi under various pfm patterns because eb is still the primary concern of households and farmers in developing countries the input output ratio is also crucial to them he et al 2018 by taking the costs of various inputs mulching materials for pfm into consideration eb was calculated for evaluating various pfm patterns regardless of the year of a natural disaster the eb of fgh ffh and fwh was better under various pfm treatments fig 7a at present the key to the sustainable agricultural crisis is that the direct eb of farmers is not necessarily consistent with our common interests to maintain the fertility of farmland soil health numerous experts and scholars are committed to producing more grain yield with lower environmental costs zhang et al 2016 yao et al 2018 thus minimizing the negative impact of pfm on the soil s physical chemical and biological properties maintaining soil health maximizing limited rainfall resources and increasing crop yield are future agricultural development trends chen et al 2014 bd ks som lai y rue and eb were chosen to calculate the best index bi and the bi values of fwh fgt and fgh were 10 3 8 9 and 8 5 respectively fig 7b using a biodegradable Ô¨Ålm or removing plastic film fragments may be options to increase bi and to minimize the negative effects of pfm on the soil environment ma et al 2018 5 conclusion significant differences were observed when field treatments were conducted for 10 y pfm has a negative influence on the physical properties of the soil s arable layer such as increased soil bd and reduced ks but pfm had a smaller impact under hm ffh fgh and fwh on bd and ks than tm fft fgt and fwt additionally hm maintained the concentrations of som and total n in the arable layer better than tm simultaneously the better lai and h of winter wheat occurred with gm fgh and fgt and wm fwh and fwt rather than sm ffh and fft or nm gm and wm had an outstanding positive impact on increasing the yield of winter wheat however fwt depleted the water in the 300 cm soil profile which promoted dry soils based on the bi value the top three pfm patterns were fwh 10 3 fgt 8 9 and fgh 8 5 therefore fwh and fgt were more suitable pfm patterns for reducing film pollution without using biodegradable film instead of polyethylene film fwh was the best pfm pattern because the plastic film reduced soil evaporation completely during the whole year to decrease the application of pfm as much as possible fgh was more beneficial to soil health due to its low coverage and short mulching period this treatment is the optimal pattern for applying pfm to winter wheat cultivation on the loess plateau and

10331,improving irrigation and fertilization management for greater productivity is critical to address water scarcity drip fertigation can synchronize the water and nitrogen n supply with crop demand offering the potential for enhanced water productivity wp and nitrogen use efficiency nue to quantitatively assess the efficacy of drip fertigation and identify the main affecting factors we used a meta analysis to evaluate the effects of drip fertigation on the yield wp and nue under different conditions and to quantify the irrigation water saving potential wsp and n saving potential nsp of drip fertigation our results showed that overall drip fertigation led to significantly higher yields 12 0 wp 26 4 and nue 34 3 while significantly decreased crop evapotranspiration et by 11 3 compared

et and wp response while n inputs had significant effects p 0 05 on yield and nue but not on wp and et the results of wsp and nsp indicated that water input under drip fertigation for maize wheat potato tomato and cotton could be further decreased by 14 41 mm 22 87 mm 20 42 mm 20 59 mm and 13 50 mm and n input could be further decreased by 23 68 kg n ha 1 26 88 kg n ha 1 33 60 kg n ha 1 21 117 kg n ha 1 and 23 66 kg n ha 1 respectively without crop yield reduction keywords meta analysis crop yield water productivity nitrogen use efficiency 1 introduction food security has long been a challenge for human societies and is a pressing global issue especially in light of ever greater restrictions on input resources rosegrant and cline 2003 cropland expansion has been the main strategy to boost food production since the mid 1960s but it also has many more side effects e g loss of soil organic c and decline in biodiversity grassini et al 2013 therefore the potential to explore additional land for agriculture in the future will be limited supplying nitrogen n for plant growth has allowed farmers to increase food production per unit of land greatly over the past century foley et al 2011 unfortunately resulting in unintended adverse environmental impacts e g groundwater contamination eutrophication of freshwater and estuarine ecosystems and tropospheric pollution related to emissions of nitrogen oxides and ammonia gas steffen et al 2015 agriculture accounts for approximately 70 of the world s freshwater use bourzac 2013 and a vast majority of the world s population lives in countries sourcing nearly all of their staple crop imports from partners who deplete groundwater to produce these crops highlighting the risks to global food and water security dalin et al 2017 further increases in n and water applications are unlikely to be effective at increasing yields because of the diminishing returns above all the scarcity of cropland depletion of freshwater resources and pollution of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems through excessive n inputs threaten food security and sustainability the expansion of cropland and water use would be best counteracted by improvements in agricultural technologies and management approaches that bring farming yields closer to the maximum yield efficiency that is ecologically possible in addition reducing fertilizer use would also require measures that improve farming practices springmann et al 2018 there are a variety of practices and improvements that could contribute to increased resource use efficiency for example deficit irrigation technology can save water resources while maintaining or even improving yield by reducing volumes of water used for irrigation kang et al 2002 du et al 2015 applications of fertilizers during periods of greatest crop demand at or near the plant roots and in smaller and more frequent applications all have the potential to reduce losses while maintaining or improving yield and quality matson et al 1998 in addition the optimization of water and fertilizer input is also crucial for improving the efficiency of resource utilization which depends on many factors such as irrigation and fertilization methods and crop types for example sun et al 2013 showed that the optimal input under furrow irrigation for tomato cultivation was 300 mm irrigation water and 150 kg n ha 1 in the autumn winter season or 300 mm irrigation water and 250 kg n ha 1 in the spring summer season however kuscu et al 2014 indicated that the optimal input under drip irrigation was 75 of the pan evaporation irrigation regime and a 180 kg n ha 1 supply furthermore although many studies have shown the optimal n application and or irrigation amount for various crops such as the recommended rate of 150 170 kg n ha 1 for wheat and 180 200 kg n ha 1 for maize yang et al 2017 most of these studies were based on experiments with traditional irrigation methods the optimal inputs of water and n for advanced technologies such as drip fertigation and the extent to which drip fertigation can further reduce the application of water and n are still questions to be studied drip or micro fertigation which uses plastic tubing to drip water and fertilizer at the base of plants in a regulated way bar yosef 1999 is an efficient way to attain high yield and high efficiency modernized drip fertigation was introduced into china in the early 1990s the higher cost in the early application of drip fertigation meant that it was mainly applied to higher value crops such as fruits and vegetables after more than 20 years of learning training and demonstration the fertigated area reached 6 million ha in 2016 representing 4 4 of the total cultivated area mara 2017 currently drip fertigation is now becoming a common practice for field crops in china and the major crops applying fertigation are cotton vegetables wheat and maize li 2018 numerous previous studies have demonstrated that drip fertigation can provide various benefits over traditional agricultural practices e g flood furrow irrigation and n broadcasting such as increased water productivity wp and nitrogen use efficiency nue wang et al 2019 si et al 2020 reduced water and n fertilizer input wang et al 2018a decreased n2o no emissions zhang et al 2019 no3 and dissolved organic n leaching lv et al 2019 and particularly similar or even higher crop yields by reduction in the irrigation water and n input li et al 2019 however past studies investigating the benefits of drip fertigation mostly focused on a site limited irrigation and or fertilizer management practice or a specific crop the results and data from these individual studies are insufficient to describe and determine the overall benefits of drip fertigation on a nationwide scale in addition the results vary widely showing different outcomes for drip fertigation in different crop types or under different climate soil or management conditions confounding influential factors make it difficult to attain a clear understanding of where and under what conditions drip fertigation is best applied meta analysis a statistical model used to analyze datapoints from separate empirical studies stanley and jarrell 1989 can overcome the abovementioned problems or difficulties by quantitative synthesis and summarization of results across multiple studies to elicit general patterns or conclusions yu et al 2020 applied a meta analysis to quantify the effects of deficit irrigation on wheat water use efficiency and yields adu et al 2018 employed a meta analysis to examine the relative crop yield performance of full irrigation deficit irrigation and partial root zone drying irrigation fan et al 2018 determined the water use efficiency of wheat and cotton by using meta regression analysis du et al 2018 and qin et al 2016 obtained water and n saving potentials in tomato and citrus production using meta analysis respectively in the present study a meta analysis was also applied to systematically analyze the available information on the effects of drip fertigation on crop yield et wp and nue to obtain an overall evaluation on the effectiveness of drip fertigation and its main affecting factors in china such a quantitative analysis is necessary to guide the development and implementation of drip fertigation in the future and to provide a reference for improving the recommendations of drip fertigation in crop cultivation therefore the objectives of the present study were to i evaluate the effects of drip fertigation on the yield et wp and nue relative to the farmers practices ii identify and quantify the main factors affecting the efficacy of drip fertigation on yield wp and nue iii identify the optimal water and n input for the studied crops and quantify the water and n saving potentials of drip fertigation 2 methods 2 1 data search and collection we comprehensively searched peer reviewed literature by using

broadcast n fertilizer and yield in the article title abstract or keywords papers dissertations and conference proceedings published in either english or chinese from january 1991 to december 2019 were collected this search produced a total of 1033 publications which were screened on the basis of the following criteria 1 studies had to represent field experiments pot experiments experiments under rainproof shelters and model simulations were excluded in china containing side by side comparisons of drip fertigation and farmers practices 2 studies had to report yields and have replications

conducted at the same experimental site if their test years were overlapping the study with the longest year was selected 5 if one study reported different years observations within the same experiment each year observation was also included as separate observations van groenigen et al 2013 finally 130 published studies were selected and included in the meta analysis appendix a if the data of interest were only shown in graphs or figures the data from graphs were obtained using getdata graph digitizer software http www getdata graph digitizer com shcherbak et al 2014 other related information including study location longitude and latitude mean annual precipitation map mean annual temperature mat experimental duration crop type cultivar plant density field plot replication crop rotation practices soil physicochemical properties n fertilizer rate and irrigation amount were extracted from the publications the distribution of 130 studies used in the meta analysis was presented in fig 1 and the complete dataset with the specific values were provided in appendix b based on theoretical knowledge and the validity of our dataset the explanatory variables considered in this meta analysis included crop type soil texture map mat n fertilizer rate and irrigation amount we also chose categories that make sense scientifically and that are commonly used in agricultural research reflecting well different agricultural practices study sites with map 800 mm were considered humid those receiving 400 800 mm were considered semihumid those receiving 200 400 mm were considered semiarid and those receiving 200 mm were considered arid mat was divided into two categories 10 c and 10 c soil texture was classified according to the united states department of agriculture soil texture triangle usda 1999 clay sandy clay and silty clay classes were designated fine textured silt silt loam silty clay loam loam and clay loam were considered medium textured and sand loamy sand sandy clay loam and sandy loam were considered coarse textured cayuela et al 2017 the n application irrigation amount was grouped into three categories lower drip fertigation lower than farmers practices equal drip fertigation equal to farmers practices and higher drip fertigation higher than farmers practices rainfed was used to denote that there was no irrigation under farmers practices 2 2 definitions water productivity was calculated as 1 wp y et where wp is water productivity kg m 3 y is the crop yield kg ha 1 and et is crop evapotranspiration mm that is actually the sum of soil evaporation and plant transpiration nitrogen use efficiency was calculated as 2 nue y n where nue is the nitrogen use efficiency kg kg 1 y is the crop yield kg ha 1 and n is the amount of n kg n ha 1 applied as fertilizer 2 3 meta analysis meta analysis is a formal quantitative statistical method to summarize results from independent experimental studies hedges et al 1999 in this study we used the effect size r to quantify the effect of drip fertigation treatments on crop yield et wp and nue 3 r x e x c where x e is the mean of the treatment group drip fertigation and x c is the mean of the control group farmers practices to express the treatment effect on a common scale the natural logarithm of the response ratio was used hedges et al 1999 4 ln r ln x e x c ln x e ln x c as many collected studies only reported the number of replicates standard deviations or standard errors were not provided to include as many studies as possible we performed analysis using non parametric weighting functions lu 2020 van groenigen et al 2011 wang et al 2020 waqas et al 2020 the weighting factor for each effect size was calculated as follows van groenigen et al 2013 5 w i n e n c n e n c where w i indicates the weight of ith lnr and n e and n c represent field replicates of drip fertigation and farmers practices respectively higher weighting is given to well replicated studies with larger sample sizes under these conditions hedges and olkin 1985 when multiple effects were extracted from the same experimental site we adjusted the weights defined above by the total number of observations from that site this approach ensured that all experimental comparisons in multifactor and multiyear studies could be included in the dataset without dominating the overall effect size li et al 2017 thus the final weights used in the analyses were as follows 6 w fi w i n site where n site is the number of observations from the same site as the ith observation the weighted average of the logarithmic response ratios was calculated for all independent studies 7 ln r i 1 m w fi ln r i i 1 m w fi where lnr i is the logarithmic response ratio for the ith comparison m is the number of studies and ln r is the mean effect size we used bootstrapping 4999 iterations to generate the mean effect size and 95 confidence interval 95 ci for each categorical variable if the values of the 95 confidence interval for the effect size of a variable did not overlap with zero the effects of drip fertigation on the variable studied were considered statistically significant otherwise the treatment effect was not significant groups with fewer than nine valid comparisons were excluded from the meta analysis to simplify the interpretation the mean effect size mes was expressed as the percentage change as follows 8 mes e ln r 1 100 the mean effect sizes were calculated using a categorical random effects model with metawin 2 1 software rosenberg et al 2000 positive percentage changes indicate an increase in the response variable under drip fertigation relative to farmers practices while negative values indicate a decrease likewise the effects of the categories were significantly different if the probability p values of between group heterogeneity were less than 0 05 p 0 05 publication bias indicates biases in the publication of articles displaying positive results over others any possibility of publication bias in the overall database for each response variable was assessed using a funnel plot duval and tweedie 2000 for each funnel plot we plotted the study size against the response ratios of yield et wp and nue respectively fig a1 the results indicated that the funnel plot of all variables was symmetrical fig a1 suggesting the absence of publication bias peters et al 2008 additionally we verified the robustness of the meta analysis process by using the sensitivity analysis method for eliminating outliers and comparing the results with the results of the original meta analysis shan and yan 2013 appendix a 2 4 estimating the water and n saving potentials to estimate the potential of conserving water and n of drip fertigation we used the concepts of water and n saving potentials and the calculation methods described in the previous studies du et al 2018 qin et al 2016 the irrigation water saving potential wsp was calculated as follows 9 wsp w w opt where w is the supra optimal input of irrigation water mm and w opt is the optimal irrigation input that maximizes yield under drip fertigation mm the percent wsp was calculated as follows 10 wsp w w opt w max 100 where w max is the maximum input of irrigation water under drip fertigation mm the n saving potential nsp was calculated follows 11 nsp n n opt where n is the supra optimal input of n kg n ha 1 and n opt is the optimal n input that maximizes yield under drip fertigation kg n ha 1 the percent nsp was calculated as follows 12 nsp n n opt n max 100 where n max is the maximum input of n under drip fertigation kg n ha 1 2 5 boosted regression tree and linear fitting models we used boosted regression tree brt models to quantitatively evaluate the relative effect of the variables crop type soil texture map mat n application rate and irrigation amount on the crop yield et wp and nue responses boosted trees were constructed using the recommended parameter values learning rate 0 01 bag fraction 0 50 cross validation 10 and tree complexity 5 elith et al 2008 due to having categorical variables the bernoulli method was used for brt fittings all brt analyses were performed with the gbm package in r version 3 3 3 elith et al 2008 we also used r version 3 3 3 to build a linear fitting model for the effects of irrigation and n on yield wue and nue in maize wheat potato tomato and cotton as follows 13 y a b 1 w b 2 n b 3 w n where y represents the independent variables including yield kg ha 1 wp kg m 3 and nue kg kg 1 w is the irrigation amount mm n is the n fertilizer application rate kg n ha 1 w n is the interaction between irrigation and n and b1 4 are coefficients of the variables 3 results 3 1 crop yield response overall drip fertigation significantly increased crop yields by 12 0 with a 95 confidence interval of 10 0 14 1 compared to farmers practices fig 2 the effect sizes of drip fertigation on yield were significantly different among all the studied crops p 0 05 potato showed the highest increase in yield 40 3 followed by fruit 13 7 maize 12 7 cotton 11 7 vegetable 9 7 tobacco 7 6 and wheat 6 0 fig 2 however the effect sizes of drip fertigation were not significant under different soil textures p 0 05 and the yield was increased by 12 5 11 3 and 10 9 in medium fine and coarse textured soil respectively fig 2 the map had a significant effect on yield responses to drip fertigation and the improvement in the semiarid region was the highest 31 0 while the mat had no significant effect on the magnitude of the yield response fig 2 water and n input had a significant effect on the magnitude of the yield response to drip fertigation p 0 05 the positive effect on the crop yield was more notable when drip fertigation used relatively higher quantities of n than farmers practices increased by 17 5 fig 2 drip fertigation significantly increased crop yields by 9 2 and 11 9 when the irrigation water amount of drip fertigation was less than or equal to farmers practices but the effect was not significant when the water amount was higher than farmers practices under the rainfed farming system drip fertigation brought about a significant increase in the yield of 34 1 fig 2 3 2 water productivity response in general drip fertigation significantly enhanced wp by 26 4 with a 95 confidence interval of 20 9 32 7 and decreased et by 11 3 15 6 to 6 8 compared to farmers practices fig 3 there were significant differences in the effects of drip fertigation on the wp and et among different crops p 0 05 potato showed the highest increase in wp 100 3 fig 3b while fruit showed the highest decrease in et 22 2 fig 3a soil texture had no significant effect on the magnitude of the wp response to drip fertigation p 0 05 but had a significant effect on the et response p 0 05 in contrast map and mat had significant effects on the magnitude of the wp response to drip fertigation p 0 05 but had no significant effect on the et response p 0 05 the increase in wp by drip fertigation was highest in the semiarid region 60 7 followed by the arid region 51 8 and semihumid region 22 3 fig 3b the increase in wp by drip fertigation was 40 5 under mat 10 much higher than that under mat 10 c fig 3b compared to farmers practices drip fertigation significantly increased wp by 18 8 34 8 and decreased et by 10 3 19 7 under different n application rate situations fig 3 but the amplitude of the effect on wp and et by drip fertigation was independent of the n application rate p 0 05 the irrigation amount had a significant effect on the magnitude of wp and et responses to drip fertigation p 0 05 drip fertigation significantly decreased et and increased wp regardless of whether the irrigation amount was lower 22 7 and 35 5 respectively or equal 3 7 and 20 1 respectively relative to farmers practices fig 3 in the rainfed farming system drip fertigation showed a positive effect on both et 16 9 and wp 18 0 fig 3 3 3 nitrogen use efficiency response on average drip fertigation increased nue by 34 3 with a 95 confidence interval of 29 0 40 1 compared with farmers practices among all studied crops fruit showed the highest increase in nue 68 2 followed by potato 46 0 legume 41 7 vegetable 33 1 maize 22 6 wheat 18 2 tobacco 17 1 and cotton 16 5 fig 4 nue responses to drip fertigation were significantly positive in fine 51 7 medium 33 7 and coarse 30 7 textured soils fig 4 but the magnitude of nue did not depend on the soil textures p 0 05 similarly the magnitude of nue increase also did not depend on mat p 0 05 map had a significant effect on the magnitude of the nue response to drip fertigation p 0 05 and the highest increase was observed in the semiarid region 59 5 nue responses to drip fertigation were significantly positive 93 6 and 14 6 respectively when the amount of n applied by drip fertigation was lower than or equal to that of farmers practices fig 4 increases in nue were more notable in the rainfed farming system 45 1 than in the irrigated farming system fig 4 drip fertigation generally had positive effects on nue regardless of the irrigation amounts and the highest increase was observed when the irrigation amount was lower than the farmers practices 34 9 however the magnitude did not depend on the irrigation amount p 0 05 fig 4 3 4 relative influence of factors to compare the relative influence of crop type soil climatic map and mat and management n application rate and irrigation amount characteristics on the responses of crop yield et wp and nue to drip fertigation we conducted brt analysis overall 96 6 98 2 of the variations in the response ratio of crop yield et wp and nue could be explained by the first five factors fig 5 crop type and irrigation amount were the key influential factors explaining the variations in the response ratio of crop yield et and wp accounting for 57 7 78 4 and 74 7 of the total variation respectively while crop type and n application rate were the key factors explaining the variation in the nue response 69 6 additionally map soil texture and n application rate were important factors for crop yield accounting for 16 9 12 2 and 11 4 respectively the soil texture mat and n application rate explained 19 1 and 22 6 of the variations in the response ratio of et and wp respectively map irrigation amount and soil texture explained 11 0 9 3 and 6 7 of the variation in the response ratio of nue respectively 3 5 water and n saving potentials the irrigation amount n application rate yield wp and nue for each type of crop varied widely table 1 figs a2 and a3 for example under drip fertigation maize yield ranged from 6266 7 to 25276 5 kg ha 1 wp was from 1 3 to 3 8 kg m 3 nue was from 25 7 to 186 5 kg kg 1 irrigation amount was between 14 and 600 mm n application rate varied from 82 to 522 kg n ha 1 wheat yield ranged from 3755 0 to 10407 0 kg ha 1 wp was from 1 3 to 3 0 kg m 3 nue was from 12 2 to 72 2 kg kg 1 irrigation amount was between 75 and 585 mm and n application rate varied from 95 to 450 kg n ha 1 relationships between irrigation and n inputs and crop yield wp and nue were also detected and the results of the linear fitting were shown in table a1 the optimal irrigation amounts under drip fertigation for maize wheat potato tomato and cotton were 132 188 123 172 and 300 mm respectively table 2 wsp varied greatly in all studied crops e g from 0 to 50 mean 14 for maize from 0 to 56 mean 22 for wheat from 0 to 41 mean 20 for potato from 0 to 46 mean 20 for tomato and from 0 to 26 mean 13 for cotton table 2 the mean wsp for maize wheat potato tomato and cotton was 41 87 42 59 and 50 mm respectively the optimal n application rates under drip fertigation were 162 138 60 353 and 155 kg n ha 1 for maize wheat potato tomato and cotton respectively table 3 each crop had a different nsp e g from 0 to 65 mean 23 for maize from 0 to 67 mean 26 for wheat from 0 to 67 mean 33 for potato from 0 to 67 mean 21 for tomato and from 0 to 50 mean 23 for cotton table 3 the mean nsp for maize wheat potato tomato and cotton was 68 88 60 117 and 66 kg n ha 1 respectively with maximizing crop yield per unit n 4 discussion 4 1 why does drip fertigation have positive effects our analysis demonstrated that drip fertigation significantly increased yields of all types of crops by 6 0 40 3 in china fig 2 this increase in yield was largely attributed to greater wp and higher nue figs 3b and 4 the increases in both yield and wp or nue under drip fertigation were mainly due to the great advantages of drip fertigation over traditional methods in water and n application farmers practices with applying water by flooding or furrowing systems and broadcasting of n fertilizer on the soil surface resulted in large evaporation losses and large nutrient losses through seepage or percolation therefore leading to low water use efficiency or wp yazar et al 2002 and low nue liu and diamond 2005 drip fertigation delivers water and water solute fertilizers simultaneously through irrigation systems to the vicinity of active roots which can facilitate water uptake and reduce the water loss in the conveyance and distribution system and evaporation loss from the soil surface thus leading to a reduction in et this was confirmed by other studies such as liao et al 2019 who observed that cherry tree et was 722 mm under a local traditional furrow irrigation strategy and drip fertigation treatments can significantly p 0 05 reduce the et by 123 mm without reducing yield our analysis also proved that drip fertigation can decrease et by 11 3 relative to farmers practices fig 3a moreover drip fertigation can maintain favorable moisture conditions in the root areas facilitate the movement of nutrients to roots through mass flow or diffusion and enhance nutrient uptake and availability to plants by synchronizing the water and fertilizer supply silber et al 2002 thus plant growth yield wp and nue under fertigation could be improved compared with conventional application si et al 2020 singandhupe et al 2003 wang et al 2019 another reason for the positive effect of drip fertigation is its advantages in optimizing the amount and frequency of water and fertilizer application traditional methods have difficulty increasing application frequency resulting in limitations in improving wp and nue for example conventional irrigation was applied at multiple day or even longer intervals resulting in a significant yield reduction due to the higher depletion of available soil moisture from the 0 60 cm soil layer and more depletion of available soil moisture between applications reduced the n availability to plants singandhupe et al 2003 under farmers practices even with optimized n management measures a 68 loss of applied n fertilizer occurred in the experimental region ren et al 2010 drip fertigation enables multiple applications of fertilizer with required application rates during specific growth stages in coordination with crop demand for more precise water and nutrient management bar yosef 1999 qin et al 2016 our analysis results confirmed that drip fertigation could significantly increase yield wp and nue by 12 0 26 4 and 34 3 respectively due to its advantages over farmers practices 4 2 why is the extent of the improvement different the performance of drip fertigation varied substantially across crop types fig 4 fruits and vegetables showed for example higher nue responses 68 2 and 33 1 respectively while staple food crops such as wheat and maize tended to have lower nue responses 18 2 and 22 6 respectively these results can be partially explained by the differences among crops in their physiological responses to water and nutrients for example pepper is considered one of the most susceptible crops to water stress so irrigation is essential for pepper production jaimez et al 2000 lamm 2016 also found that the frequency of drip irrigation daily to weekly was not important for deeply rooted commodity crops cotton and maize but tended to be especially beneficial for vegetable crops therefore drip fertigation had relatively higher effect on yield wp and nue compared to non sensitive crops because it can meet the needs of sensitive crops e g vegetables during the critical growth period by providing the required amount of water and n in a timely and frequent manner drip fertigation performed better for nue increase in fine textured soil 51 7 than medium 33 7 or coarse 30 7 textured soil fig 4 one possible explanation for this finding is that fine textured soil has high nutrient and water holding capacity low infiltration and drainage rates brady and weil 2009 and higher root biomass barbosa et al 2018 which are conducive to drip fertilization to improve water and nutrient uptake by optimally delivering water and nutrients however our results showed that on the whole soil texture had no significant influence on the effect sizes of drip fertigation indicating that drip irrigation can give full play to its advantages and effects under different soil textures our analysis showed that improvements in drip fertigation were affected by climate factors including mean annual temperature and precipitation overall the mat had no significant effect p 0 05 on the magnitude of yield and nue responses while the map had a significant effect p 0 05 on the responses of yield wp and nue drip fertigation in the semiarid region resulted in the largest yield 31 0 wp 60 7 and nue 59 5 increases this could be explained by the fact that in the semiarid region irrigation water is the main water source for crop growth because precipitation is far less than crop water consumption which highlights the importance of irrigation in obtaining higher yield and wp therefore it is not surprising that the effect of drip fertigation was more obvious in semiarid regions because the distinctive yield and wp performance reflected in drip irrigation over traditional irrigation is further magnified by the application of drip fertigation technology the results of the meta analysis showed that the extents of the improvement in crop yield and wp of drip fertigation were significant when the irrigation water amount was less than the farmers practices but not significant when the water amount was higher than the farmers practices figs 2 and 3 similarly the nue response to drip fertigation was not significant when n input was higher than farmers practices fig 4 this indicates that the optimal irrigation amount and n application rates are essential for drip irrigation to play an effective role in the present study the irrigation amount and n application rate of farmers practices were much higher table 1 for example the mean n application rate of wheat was 242 kg n ha 1 much higher than the recommended rate of 150 170 kg n ha 1 yang et al 2017 therefore when the input of water and n of drip fertigation was higher than farmers practices overuse of water and n fertilizer would occur resulting in drainage and n leaching loss and thereby in low wp and nue yazar et al 2002 ultimately leading to no significant effect compared with farmers practices treatment our results also showed that irrigation amount was the second most important factor affecting the extent of crop yield et and wp responses fig 5 while n inputs had no significant effect p 0 05 on wp and et fig 3 the reason for this could be explained by the mechanism of improving water use efficiency under fertigation i e stomatal conductance rather than n nutrition predominated plant water use efficiency under fertigation wang et al 2018b and wp could be improved significantly by moderating the water amount of irrigation under n supply conditions 4 3 the application of drip fertigation in the future as is known expanding cropland and increasing the use of water and n to achieve food security is not desirable numerous studies have suggested that drip fertigation has great potential to enhance wp and nue by synchronizing the water and n supply in line with crop demands our meta analysis results confirmed that drip fertigation had overall positive effects on crop yield wp and nue compared to farmers practices on the other hand drip fertigation itself still has great potential in water and n input optimization water and n saving potential refers to how much water and n can be reduced compared to the optimal amount and must be considered in terms of yield and resource use efficiency as a whole du et al 2018 fan et al 2018 qin et al 2016 based on our analyses the optimal n inputs for maize and wheat obtained in the present study were 162 kg n ha 1 and 138 kg n ha 1 respectively table 3 however the observation with n input of drip fertigation larger than this value accounted for 88 3 and 80 0 of the total observations in maize and wheat respectively appendix b indicating that the input of drip fertigation could be further optimized the water saving potential wsp of drip fertigation ranged from 13 cotton to 22 wheat and the n fertilizer saving potential nsp ranged from 21 tomato to 33 potato tables 2 and 3 these results can provide useful references for the optimization of water and n inputs in drip fertigation application for different crops in addition although the results of the effect size of drip fertigation showed that gains in yield and resource use efficiency for cereal crops e g wheat and maize were relatively smaller than those for high value crops e g fruits drip fertigation in maize and wheat still had large potential for water and n savings therefore the application of drip fertigation in maize and wheat has a great overall impact on resource conservation in china due to their larger production scale and total volumes and will demonstrate substantial potential to meet food demands with existing farmland and limited water resources despite the potential of drip fertigation for effective water and n savings in practice there is a need for improvement in the management of this technology to make it effective both environmental performance and economic responses need to be considered excessive application or poor management practices can cause pollution in many cases several studies have suggested that drip fertigation has a lower environmental impact than traditional practices while achieving higher crop yield for example zhang et al 2019 and yao et al 2019 demonstrated that drip fertigation decreased n2o and no emissions by 21 8 and 29 8 during the wheat season and by 31 5 and 41 6 during the maize season respectively sharma et al 2012 also demonstrated that drip fertigation could reduce nitrate n deep percolation by 47 5 although it is strongly recommended by the agricultural extension authority in china the development of drip fertigation is still relatively slow due to some practical and technical problems the main reasons are that the size of chinese farms is too small 0 1 0 2 ha each to afford the expenses associated with installation of the drip irrigation system for a single farm in addition there are also some technical problems such as the blockage of nozzles by water with high salt content in some regions fan et al 2014 however if this technology is priced appropriately is easy to install maintain and use and is used with reliable predictions so that farmers can ensure that they are not underwatering then we believe farmers will adopt this technique bourzac 2013 drip fertigation will be a key pathway for the sustainable development of food systems within china and other resource limited regions information derived from this study will be useful for developing relevant policies as well as practical guidance such information also provides a basis for a national or global projection of drip fertigation s potential role in helping to cope with resource limitations we hope that the country specific data and range of scenarios examined in this study can provide a good starting point for this endeavor 4 4 uncertainties and limitations as we mentioned before the major crops for which drip fertigation is used are cotton vegetables wheat and maize in china li 2018 our dataset indicated that many researchers 113 pairwise comparisons studied the effect of drip fertigation on maize yield wp nue and this large dataset provided a good basis for some in depth analysis related to maize however there were relatively few studies and observations to conduct the analysis of the effect of drip fertigation on cotton and potato especially on et and wp this may lead to high or low effectiveness of drip fertigation on cotton and potato the relatively large 95 confidential intervals for estimating potato yield wp nue increase of drip fertigation may also be due to this although the dataset sizes were different the results of our analysis indicated that drip fertigation still had great potential to be explored by optimizing the input of water and n fertilizer to avoid imbalanced datasets and to further derive sound recommendations based on sufficient data from studies we can try to expand the dataset using worldwide publications and then specifically analyze the effect of drip fertigation on potato and or cotton in the future based on theoretical knowledge and the validity of our dataset we considered crop type soil texture map mat n fertilizer rate and irrigation amount as the explanatory variables however other factors e g drip fertigation frequency and fertilizer type may also influence irrigation and or n inputs and the effectiveness of drip fertigation we planned to include these factors in this meta analysis however there are few studies and observations to conduct this analysis in addition it is difficult to group the drip fertigation frequency and fertilizer type when considering all crops further field studies can be carried out to fill these knowledge gaps 5 conclusion our present work aims to obtain a national overview of the productivity of drip fertigation through a holistic evaluation of different crop types under wide ranging conditions and then quantify the water and n saving potentials of drip fertigation for the studied crops to this end we constructed a dataset from 130 relevant research papers published between 1991 and 2019 from 23 provinces municipalities we concluded that drip fertigation is an efficient way to enhance crop productivity with the potential to increase yield 12 0 and enhance wp 26 4 and nue 34 3 however the extent of improvement was highly dependent on crop types and subject to edaphic climatic and managerial factors our results also indicated that under drip fertigation irrigation water input for maize wheat potato tomato and cotton could be further decreased by 14 41 mm 22 87 mm 20 42 mm 20 59 mm and 13 50 mm respectively and n input for maize wheat potato tomato and cotton could be further decreased by 23 68 kg n ha 1 26 88 kg n ha 1 33 60 kg n ha 1 21 117 kg n ha 1 and 23 66 kg n ha 1 respectively with maximizing crop yield per unit irrigation water and n these results provide practical guidelines

10331,improving irrigation and fertilization management for greater productivity is critical to address water scarcity drip fertigation can synchronize the water and nitrogen n supply with crop demand offering the potential for enhanced water productivity wp and nitrogen use efficiency nue to quantitatively assess the efficacy of drip fertigation and identify the main affecting factors we used a meta analysis to evaluate the effects of drip fertigation on the yield wp and nue under different conditions and to quantify the irrigation water saving potential wsp and n saving potential nsp of drip fertigation our results showed that overall drip fertigation led to significantly higher yields 12 0 wp 26 4 and nue 34 3 while significantly decreased crop evapotranspiration et by 11 3 compared to farmers practices referring to traditional irrigation by furrow or flood and fertilization by broadcasting n fertilizer broadcasting n fertilizer without irrigation in rainfed farming however the extent of improvement highly depended on crop types and was subject to edaphic climatic and managerial factors among crop types potato showed the highest increase in yield 40 3 and wp 100 3 and fruit showed the highest increase in nue 68 2 at a regional scale drip fertigation performed best in semiarid regions in addition irrigation water inputs had large effects p 0 05 on the magnitude of yield et and wp response while n inputs had significant effects p 0 05 on yield and nue but not on wp and et the results of wsp and nsp indicated that water input under drip fertigation for maize wheat potato tomato and cotton could be further decreased by 14 41 mm 22 87 mm 20 42 mm 20 59 mm and 13 50 mm and n input could be further decreased by 23 68 kg n ha 1 26 88 kg n ha 1 33 60 kg n ha 1 21 117 kg n ha 1 and 23 66 kg n ha 1 respectively without crop yield reduction keywords meta analysis crop yield water productivity nitrogen use efficiency 1 introduction food security has long been a challenge for human societies and is a pressing global issue especially in light of ever greater restrictions on input resources rosegrant and cline 2003 cropland expansion has been the main strategy to boost food production since the mid 1960s but it also has many more side effects e g loss of soil organic c and decline in biodiversity grassini et al 2013 therefore the potential to explore additional land for agriculture in the future will be limited supplying nitrogen n for plant growth has allowed farmers to increase food production per unit of land greatly over the past century foley et al 2011 unfortunately resulting in unintended adverse environmental impacts e g groundwater contamination eutrophication of freshwater and estuarine ecosystems and tropospheric pollution related to emissions of nitrogen oxides and ammonia gas steffen et al 2015 agriculture accounts for approximately 70 of the world s freshwater use bourzac 2013 and a vast majority of the world s population lives in countries sourcing nearly all of their staple crop imports from partners who deplete groundwater to produce these crops highlighting the risks to global food and water security dalin et al 2017 further increases in n and water applications are unlikely to be effective at increasing yields because of the diminishing returns above all the scarcity of cropland depletion of freshwater resources and pollution of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems through excessive n inputs threaten food security and sustainability the expansion of cropland and water use would be best counteracted by improvements in agricultural technologies and management approaches that bring farming yields closer to the maximum yield efficiency that is ecologically possible in addition reducing fertilizer use would also require measures that improve farming practices springmann et al 2018 there are a variety of practices and improvements that could contribute to increased resource use efficiency for example deficit irrigation technology can save water resources while maintaining or even improving yield by reducing volumes of water used for irrigation kang et al 2002 du et al 2015 applications of fertilizers during periods of greatest crop demand at or near the plant roots and in smaller and more frequent applications all have the potential to reduce losses while maintaining or improving yield and quality matson et al 1998 in addition the optimization of water and fertilizer input is also crucial for improving the efficiency of resource utilization which depends on many factors such as irrigation and fertilization methods and crop types for example sun et al 2013 showed that the optimal input under furrow irrigation for tomato cultivation was 300 mm irrigation water and 150 kg n ha 1 in the autumn winter season or 300 mm irrigation water and 250 kg n ha 1 in the spring summer season however kuscu et al 2014 indicated that the optimal input under drip irrigation was 75 of the pan evaporation irrigation regime and a 180 kg n ha 1 supply furthermore although many studies have shown the optimal n application and or irrigation amount for various crops such as the recommended rate of 150 170 kg n ha 1 for wheat and 180 200 kg n ha 1 for maize yang et al 2017 most of these studies were based on experiments with traditional irrigation methods the optimal inputs of water and n for advanced technologies such as drip fertigation and the extent to which drip fertigation can further reduce the application of water and n are still questions to be studied drip or micro fertigation which uses plastic tubing to drip water and fertilizer at the base of plants in a regulated way bar yosef 1999 is an efficient way to attain high yield and high efficiency modernized drip fertigation was introduced into china in the early 1990s the higher cost in the early application of drip fertigation meant that it was mainly applied to higher value crops such as fruits and vegetables after more than 20 years of learning training and demonstration the fertigated area reached 6 million ha in 2016 representing 4 4 of the total cultivated area mara 2017 currently drip fertigation is now becoming a common practice for field crops in china and the major crops applying fertigation are cotton vegetables wheat and maize li 2018 numerous previous studies have demonstrated that drip fertigation can provide various benefits over traditional agricultural practices e g flood furrow irrigation and n broadcasting such as increased water productivity wp and nitrogen use efficiency nue wang et al 2019 si et al 2020 reduced water and n fertilizer input wang et al 2018a decreased n2o no emissions zhang et al 2019 no3 and dissolved organic n leaching lv et al 2019 and particularly similar or even higher crop yields by reduction in the irrigation water and n input li et al 2019 however past studies investigating the benefits of drip fertigation mostly focused on a site limited irrigation and or fertilizer management practice or a specific crop the results and data from these individual studies are insufficient to describe and determine the overall benefits of drip fertigation on a nationwide scale in addition the results vary widely showing different outcomes for drip fertigation in different crop types or under different climate soil or management conditions confounding influential factors make it difficult to attain a clear understanding of where and under what conditions drip fertigation is best applied meta analysis a statistical model used to analyze datapoints from separate empirical studies stanley and jarrell 1989 can overcome the abovementioned problems or difficulties by quantitative synthesis and summarization of results across multiple studies to elicit general patterns or conclusions yu et al 2020 applied a meta analysis to quantify the effects of deficit irrigation on wheat water use efficiency and yields adu et al 2018 employed a meta analysis to examine the relative crop yield performance of full irrigation deficit irrigation and partial root zone drying irrigation fan et al 2018 determined the water use efficiency of wheat and cotton by using meta regression analysis du et al 2018 and qin et al 2016 obtained water and n saving potentials in tomato and citrus production using meta analysis respectively in the present study a meta analysis was also applied to systematically analyze the available information on the effects of drip fertigation on crop yield et wp and nue to obtain an overall evaluation on the effectiveness of drip fertigation and its main affecting factors in china such a quantitative analysis is necessary to guide the development and implementation of drip fertigation in the future and to provide a reference for improving the recommendations of drip fertigation in crop cultivation therefore the objectives of the present study were to i evaluate the effects of drip fertigation on the yield et wp and nue relative to the farmers practices ii identify and quantify the main factors affecting the efficacy of drip fertigation on yield wp and nue iii identify the optimal water and n input for the studied crops and quantify the water and n saving potentials of drip fertigation 2 methods 2 1 data search and collection we comprehensively searched peer reviewed literature by using available online internet databases http apps webofknowledge com http www sciencedirect com http link springer com http onlinelibrary wiley com http www cnki net and http g wanfangdata com cn with search topics related to yield evapotranspiration wp and nue under drip fertigation and farmers practices farmers practices referred to traditional irrigation by furrow or flood and fertilization by

broadcast n fertilizer and yield in the article title abstract or keywords papers dissertations and conference proceedings published in either english or chinese from january 1991 to december 2019 were collected this search produced a total of 1033 publications which were screened on the basis of the following criteria 1 studies had to represent field experiments pot experiments experiments under rainproof shelters and model simulations were excluded in china containing side by side comparisons of drip fertigation and farmers practices 2 studies had to report yields and have replications and plots should be randomized 3 the drip fertigation and farmers practices treatments had to be applied to the same amount of p k fertilizer and or other macronutrients 4 for different studies conducted at the same experimental site if their test years were overlapping the study with the longest year was selected 5 if one study reported different years observations within the same experiment each year observation was also included as separate observations van groenigen et al 2013 finally 130 published studies were selected and included in the meta analysis appendix a if the data of interest were only shown in graphs or figures the data from graphs were obtained using getdata graph digitizer software http www getdata graph digitizer com shcherbak et al 2014 other related information including study location longitude and latitude mean annual precipitation map mean annual temperature mat experimental duration crop type cultivar plant density field plot replication crop rotation practices soil physicochemical properties n fertilizer rate and irrigation amount were extracted from the publications the distribution of 130 studies used in the meta analysis was presented in fig 1 and the complete dataset with the specific values were provided in appendix b based on theoretical knowledge and the validity of our dataset the explanatory variables considered in this meta analysis included crop type soil texture map mat n fertilizer rate and irrigation amount we also chose categories that make sense scientifically and that are commonly used in agricultural research reflecting well different agricultural practices study sites with map 800 mm were considered humid those receiving 400 800 mm were considered semihumid those receiving 200 400 mm were considered semiarid and those receiving 200 mm were considered arid mat was divided into two categories 10 c and 10 c soil texture was classified according to the united states department of agriculture soil texture triangle usda 1999 clay sandy clay and silty clay classes were designated fine textured silt silt loam silty clay loam loam and clay loam were considered medium textured and sand loamy sand sandy clay loam and sandy loam were considered coarse textured cayuela et al 2017 the n application irrigation amount was grouped into three categories lower drip fertigation lower than farmers practices equal drip fertigation equal to farmers practices and higher drip fertigation higher than farmers practices rainfed was used to denote that there was no irrigation under farmers practices 2 2 definitions water productivity was calculated as 1 wp y et where wp is water productivity kg m 3 y is the crop yield kg ha 1 and et is crop evapotranspiration mm that is actually the sum of soil evaporation and plant transpiration nitrogen use efficiency was calculated as 2 nue y n where nue is the nitrogen use efficiency kg kg 1 y is the crop yield kg ha 1 and n is the amount of n kg n ha 1 applied as fertilizer 2 3 meta analysis meta analysis is a formal quantitative statistical method to summarize results from independent experimental studies hedges et al 1999 in this study we used the effect size r to quantify the effect of drip fertigation treatments on crop yield et wp and nue 3 r x e x c where x e is the mean of the treatment group drip fertigation and x c is the mean of the control group farmers practices to express the treatment effect on a common scale the natural logarithm of the response ratio was used hedges et al 1999 4 ln r ln x e x c ln x e ln x c as many collected studies only reported the number of replicates standard deviations or standard errors were not provided to include as many studies as possible we performed analysis using non parametric weighting functions lu 2020 van groenigen et al 2011 wang et al 2020 waqas et al 2020 the weighting factor for each effect size was calculated as follows van groenigen et al 2013 5 w i n e n c n e n c where w i indicates the weight of ith lnr and n e and n c represent field replicates of drip fertigation and farmers practices respectively higher weighting is given to well replicated studies with larger sample sizes under these conditions hedges and olkin 1985 when multiple effects were extracted from the same experimental site we adjusted the weights defined above by the total number of observations from that site this approach ensured that all experimental comparisons in multifactor and multiyear studies could be included in the dataset without dominating the overall effect size li et al 2017 thus the final weights used in the analyses were as follows 6 w fi w i n site where n site is the number of observations from the same site as the ith observation the weighted average of the logarithmic response ratios was calculated for all independent studies 7 ln r i 1 m w fi ln r i i 1 m w fi where lnr i is the logarithmic response ratio for the ith comparison m is the number of studies and ln r is the mean effect size we used bootstrapping 4999 iterations to generate the mean effect size and 95 confidence interval 95 ci for each categorical variable if the values of the 95 confidence interval for the effect size of a variable did not overlap with zero the effects of drip fertigation on the variable studied were considered statistically significant otherwise the treatment effect was not significant groups with fewer than nine valid comparisons were excluded from the meta analysis to simplify the interpretation the mean effect size mes was expressed as the percentage change as follows 8 mes e ln r 1 100 the mean effect sizes were calculated using a categorical random effects model with metawin 2 1 software rosenberg et al 2000 positive percentage changes indicate an increase in the response variable under drip fertigation relative to farmers practices while negative values indicate a decrease likewise the effects of the categories were significantly different if the probability p values of between group heterogeneity were less than 0 05 p 0 05 publication bias indicates biases in the publication of articles displaying positive results over others any possibility of publication bias in the overall database for each response variable was assessed using a funnel plot duval and tweedie 2000 for each funnel plot we plotted the study size against the response ratios of yield et wp and nue respectively fig a1 the results indicated that the funnel plot of all variables was symmetrical fig a1 suggesting the absence of publication bias peters et al 2008 additionally we verified the robustness of the meta analysis process by using the sensitivity analysis method for eliminating outliers and comparing the results with the results of the original meta analysis shan and yan 2013 appendix a 2 4 estimating the water and n saving potentials to estimate the potential of conserving water and n of drip fertigation we used the concepts of water and n saving potentials and the calculation methods described in the previous studies du et al 2018 qin et al 2016 the irrigation water saving potential wsp was calculated as follows 9 wsp w w opt where w is the supra optimal input of irrigation water mm and w opt is the optimal irrigation input that maximizes yield under drip fertigation mm the percent wsp was calculated as follows 10 wsp w w opt w max 100 where w max is the maximum input of irrigation water under drip fertigation mm the n saving potential nsp was calculated follows 11 nsp n n opt where n is the supra optimal input of n kg n ha 1 and n opt is the optimal n input that maximizes yield under drip fertigation kg n ha 1 the percent nsp was calculated as follows 12 nsp n n opt n max 100 where n max is the maximum input of n under drip fertigation kg n ha 1 2 5 boosted regression tree and linear fitting models we used boosted regression tree brt models to quantitatively evaluate the relative effect of the variables crop type soil texture map mat n application rate and irrigation amount on the crop yield et wp and nue responses boosted trees were constructed using the recommended parameter values learning rate 0 01 bag fraction 0 50 cross validation 10 and tree complexity 5 elith et al 2008 due to having categorical variables the bernoulli method was used for brt fittings all brt analyses were performed with the gbm package in r version 3 3 3 elith et al 2008 we also used r version 3 3 3 to build a linear fitting model for the effects of irrigation and n on yield wue and nue in maize wheat potato tomato and cotton as follows 13 y a b 1 w b 2 n b 3 w n where y represents the independent variables including yield kg ha 1 wp kg m 3 and nue kg kg 1 w is the irrigation amount mm n is the n fertilizer application rate kg n ha 1 w n is the interaction between irrigation and n and b1 4 are coefficients of the variables 3 results 3 1 crop yield response overall drip fertigation significantly increased crop yields by 12 0 with a 95 confidence interval of 10 0 14 1 compared to farmers practices fig 2 the effect sizes of drip fertigation on yield were significantly different among all the studied crops p 0 05 potato showed the highest increase in yield 40 3 followed by fruit 13 7 maize 12 7 cotton 11 7 vegetable 9 7 tobacco 7 6 and wheat 6 0 fig 2 however the effect sizes of drip fertigation were not significant under different soil textures p 0 05 and the yield was increased by 12 5 11 3 and 10 9 in medium fine and coarse textured soil respectively fig 2 the map had a significant effect on yield responses to drip fertigation and the improvement in the semiarid region was the highest 31 0 while the mat had no significant effect on the magnitude of the yield response fig 2 water and n input had a significant effect on the magnitude of the yield response to drip fertigation p 0 05 the positive effect on the crop yield was more notable when drip fertigation used relatively higher quantities of n than farmers practices increased by 17 5 fig 2 drip fertigation significantly increased crop yields by 9 2 and 11 9 when the irrigation water amount of drip fertigation was less than or equal to farmers practices but the effect was not significant when the water amount was higher than farmers practices under the rainfed farming system drip fertigation brought about a significant increase in the yield of 34 1 fig 2 3 2 water productivity response in general drip fertigation significantly enhanced wp by 26 4 with a 95 confidence interval of 20 9 32 7 and decreased et by 11 3 15 6 to 6 8 compared to farmers practices fig 3 there were significant differences in the effects of drip fertigation on the wp and et among different crops p 0 05 potato showed the highest increase in wp 100 3 fig 3b while fruit showed the highest decrease in et 22 2 fig 3a soil texture had no significant effect on the magnitude of the wp response to drip fertigation p 0 05 but had a significant effect on the et response p 0 05 in contrast map and mat had significant effects on the magnitude of the wp response to drip fertigation p 0 05 but had no significant effect on the et response p 0 05 the increase in wp by drip fertigation was highest in the semiarid region 60 7 followed by the arid region 51 8 and semihumid region 22 3 fig 3b the increase in wp by drip fertigation was 40 5 under mat 10 much higher than that under mat 10 c fig 3b compared to farmers practices drip fertigation significantly increased wp by 18 8 34 8 and decreased et by 10 3 19 7 under different n application rate situations fig 3 but the amplitude of the effect on wp and et by drip fertigation was independent of the n application rate p 0 05 the irrigation amount had a significant effect on the magnitude of wp and et responses to drip fertigation p 0 05 drip fertigation significantly decreased et and increased wp regardless of whether the irrigation amount was lower 22 7 and 35 5 respectively or equal 3 7 and 20 1 respectively relative to farmers practices fig 3 in the rainfed farming system drip fertigation showed a positive effect on both et 16 9 and wp 18 0 fig 3 3 3 nitrogen use efficiency response on average drip fertigation increased nue by 34 3 with a 95 confidence interval of 29 0 40 1 compared with farmers practices among all studied crops fruit showed the highest increase in nue 68 2 followed by potato 46 0 legume 41 7 vegetable 33 1 maize 22 6 wheat 18 2 tobacco 17 1 and cotton 16 5 fig 4 nue responses to drip fertigation were significantly positive in fine 51 7 medium 33 7 and coarse 30 7 textured soils fig 4 but the magnitude of nue did not depend on the soil textures p 0 05 similarly the magnitude of nue increase also did not depend on mat p 0 05 map had a significant effect on the magnitude of the nue response to drip fertigation p 0 05 and the highest increase was observed in the semiarid region 59 5 nue responses to drip fertigation were significantly positive 93 6 and 14 6 respectively when the amount of n applied by drip fertigation was lower than or equal to that of farmers practices fig 4 increases in nue were more notable in the rainfed farming system 45 1 than in the irrigated farming system fig 4 drip fertigation generally had positive effects on nue regardless of the irrigation amounts and the highest increase was observed when the irrigation amount was lower than the farmers practices 34 9 however the magnitude did not depend on the irrigation amount p 0 05 fig 4 3 4 relative influence of factors to compare the relative influence of crop type soil climatic map and mat and management n application rate and irrigation amount characteristics on the responses of crop yield et wp and nue to drip fertigation we conducted brt analysis overall 96 6 98 2 of the variations in the response ratio of crop yield et wp and nue could be explained by the first five factors fig 5 crop type and irrigation amount were the key influential factors explaining the variations in the response ratio of crop yield et and wp accounting for 57 7 78 4 and 74 7 of the total variation respectively while crop type and n application rate were the key factors explaining the variation in the nue response 69 6 additionally map soil texture and n application rate were important factors for crop yield accounting for 16 9 12 2 and 11 4 respectively the soil texture mat and n application rate explained 19 1 and 22 6 of the variations in the response ratio of et and wp respectively map irrigation amount and soil texture explained 11 0 9 3 and 6 7 of the variation in the response ratio of nue respectively 3 5 water and n saving potentials the irrigation amount n application rate yield wp and nue for each type of crop varied widely table 1 figs a2 and a3 for example under drip fertigation maize yield ranged from 6266 7 to 25276 5 kg ha 1 wp was from 1 3 to 3 8 kg m 3 nue was from 25 7 to 186 5 kg kg 1 irrigation amount was between 14 and 600 mm n application rate varied from 82 to 522 kg n ha 1 wheat yield ranged from 3755 0 to 10407 0 kg ha 1 wp was from 1 3 to 3 0 kg m 3 nue was from 12 2 to 72 2 kg kg 1 irrigation amount was between 75 and 585 mm and n application rate varied from 95 to 450 kg n ha 1 relationships between irrigation and n inputs and crop yield wp and nue were also detected and the results of the linear fitting were shown in table a1 the optimal irrigation amounts under drip fertigation for maize wheat potato tomato and cotton were 132 188 123 172 and 300 mm respectively table 2 wsp varied greatly in all studied crops e g from 0 to 50 mean 14 for maize from 0 to 56 mean 22 for wheat from 0 to 41 mean 20 for potato from 0 to 46 mean 20 for tomato and from 0 to 26 mean 13 for cotton table 2 the mean wsp for maize wheat potato tomato and cotton was 41 87 42 59 and 50 mm respectively the optimal n application rates under drip fertigation were 162 138 60 353 and 155 kg n ha 1 for maize wheat potato tomato and cotton respectively table 3 each crop had a different nsp e g from 0 to 65 mean 23 for maize from 0 to 67 mean 26 for wheat from 0 to 67 mean 33 for potato from 0 to 67 mean 21 for tomato and from 0 to 50 mean 23 for cotton table 3 the mean nsp for maize wheat potato tomato and cotton was 68 88 60 117 and 66 kg n ha 1 respectively with maximizing crop yield per unit n 4 discussion 4 1 why does drip fertigation have positive effects our analysis demonstrated that drip fertigation significantly increased yields of all types of crops by 6 0 40 3 in china fig 2 this increase in yield was largely attributed to greater wp and higher nue figs 3b and 4 the increases in both yield and wp or nue under drip fertigation were mainly due to the great advantages of drip fertigation over traditional methods in water and n application farmers practices with applying water by flooding or furrowing systems and broadcasting of n fertilizer on the soil surface resulted in large evaporation losses and large nutrient losses through seepage or percolation therefore leading to low water use efficiency or wp yazar et al 2002 and low nue liu and diamond 2005 drip fertigation delivers water and water solute fertilizers simultaneously through irrigation systems to the vicinity of active roots which can facilitate water uptake and reduce the water loss in the conveyance and distribution system and evaporation loss from the soil surface thus leading to a reduction in et this was confirmed by other studies such as liao et al 2019 who observed that cherry tree et was 722 mm under a local traditional furrow irrigation strategy and drip fertigation treatments can significantly p 0 05 reduce the et by 123 mm without reducing yield our analysis also proved that drip fertigation can decrease et by 11 3 relative to farmers practices fig 3a moreover drip fertigation can maintain favorable moisture conditions in the root areas facilitate the movement of nutrients to roots through mass flow or diffusion and enhance nutrient uptake and availability to plants by synchronizing the water and fertilizer supply silber et al 2002 thus plant growth yield wp and nue under fertigation could be improved compared with conventional application si et al 2020 singandhupe et al 2003 wang et al 2019 another reason for the positive effect of drip fertigation is its advantages in optimizing the amount and frequency of water and fertilizer application traditional methods have difficulty increasing application frequency resulting in limitations in improving wp and nue for example conventional irrigation was applied at multiple day or even longer intervals resulting in a significant yield reduction due to the higher depletion of available soil moisture from the 0 60 cm soil layer and more depletion of available soil moisture between applications reduced the n availability to plants singandhupe et al 2003 under farmers practices even with optimized n management measures a 68 loss of applied n fertilizer occurred in the experimental region ren et al 2010 drip fertigation enables multiple applications of fertilizer with required application rates during specific growth stages in coordination with crop demand for more precise water and nutrient management bar yosef 1999 qin et al 2016 our analysis results confirmed that drip fertigation could significantly increase yield wp and nue by 12 0 26 4 and 34 3 respectively due to its advantages over farmers practices 4 2 why is the extent of the improvement different the performance of drip fertigation varied substantially across crop types fig 4 fruits and vegetables showed for example higher nue responses 68 2 and 33 1 respectively while staple food crops such as wheat and maize tended to have lower nue responses 18 2 and 22 6 respectively these results can be partially explained by the differences among crops in their physiological responses to water and nutrients for example pepper is considered one of the most susceptible crops to water stress so irrigation is essential for pepper production jaimez et al 2000 lamm 2016 also found that the frequency of drip irrigation daily to weekly was not important for deeply rooted commodity crops cotton and maize but tended to be especially beneficial for vegetable crops therefore drip fertigation had relatively higher effect on yield wp and nue compared to non sensitive crops because it can meet the needs of sensitive crops e g vegetables during the critical growth period by providing the required amount of water and n in a timely and frequent manner drip fertigation performed better for nue increase in fine textured soil 51 7 than medium 33 7 or coarse 30 7 textured soil fig 4 one possible explanation for this finding is that fine textured soil has high nutrient and water holding capacity low infiltration and drainage rates brady and weil 2009 and higher root biomass barbosa et al 2018 which are conducive to drip fertilization to improve water and nutrient uptake by optimally delivering water and nutrients however our results showed that on the whole soil texture had no significant influence on the effect sizes of drip fertigation indicating that drip irrigation can give full play to its advantages and effects under different soil textures our analysis showed that improvements in drip fertigation were affected by climate factors including mean annual temperature and precipitation overall the mat had no significant effect p 0 05 on the magnitude of yield and nue responses while the map had a significant effect p 0 05 on the responses of yield wp and nue drip fertigation in the semiarid region resulted in the largest yield 31 0 wp 60 7 and nue 59 5 increases this could be explained by the fact that in the semiarid region irrigation water is the main water source for crop growth because precipitation is far less than crop water consumption which highlights the importance of irrigation in obtaining higher yield and wp therefore it is not surprising that the effect of drip fertigation was more obvious in semiarid regions because the distinctive yield and wp performance reflected in drip irrigation over traditional irrigation is further magnified by the application of drip fertigation technology the results of the meta analysis showed that the extents of the improvement in crop yield and wp of drip fertigation were significant when the irrigation water amount was less than the farmers practices but not significant when the water amount was higher than the farmers practices figs 2 and 3 similarly the nue response to drip fertigation was not significant when n input was higher than farmers practices fig 4 this indicates that the optimal irrigation amount and n application rates are essential for drip irrigation to play an effective role in the present study the irrigation amount and n application rate of farmers practices were much higher table 1 for example the mean n application rate of wheat was 242 kg n ha 1 much higher than the recommended rate of 150 170 kg n ha 1 yang et al 2017 therefore when the input of water and n of drip fertigation was higher than farmers practices overuse of water and n fertilizer would occur resulting in drainage and n leaching loss and thereby in low wp and nue yazar et al 2002 ultimately leading to no significant effect compared with farmers practices treatment our results also showed that irrigation amount was the second most important factor affecting the extent of crop yield et and wp responses fig 5 while n inputs had no significant effect p 0 05 on wp and et fig 3 the reason for this could be explained by the mechanism of improving water use efficiency under fertigation i e stomatal conductance rather than n nutrition predominated plant water use efficiency under fertigation wang et al 2018b and wp could be improved significantly by moderating the water amount of irrigation under n supply conditions 4 3 the application of drip fertigation in the future as is known expanding cropland and increasing the use of water and n to achieve food security is not desirable numerous studies have suggested that drip fertigation has great potential to enhance wp and nue by synchronizing the water and n supply in line with crop demands our meta analysis results confirmed that drip fertigation had overall positive effects on crop yield wp and nue compared to farmers practices on the other hand drip fertigation itself still has great potential in water and n input optimization water and n saving potential refers to how much water and n can be reduced compared to the optimal amount and must be considered in terms of yield and resource use efficiency as a whole du et al 2018 fan et al 2018 qin et al 2016 based on our analyses the optimal n inputs for maize and wheat obtained in the present study were 162 kg n ha 1 and 138 kg n ha 1 respectively table 3 however the observation with n input of drip fertigation larger than this value accounted for 88 3 and 80 0 of the total observations in maize and wheat respectively appendix b indicating that the input of drip fertigation could be further optimized the water saving potential wsp of drip fertigation ranged from 13 cotton to 22 wheat and the n fertilizer saving potential nsp ranged from 21 tomato to 33 potato tables 2 and 3 these results can provide useful references for the optimization of water and n inputs in drip fertigation application for different crops in addition although the results of the effect size of drip fertigation showed that gains in yield and resource use efficiency for cereal crops e g wheat and maize were relatively smaller than those for high value crops e g fruits drip fertigation in maize and wheat still had large potential for water and n savings therefore the application of drip fertigation in maize and wheat has a great overall impact on resource conservation in china due to their larger production scale and total volumes and will demonstrate substantial potential to meet food demands with existing farmland and limited water resources despite the potential of drip fertigation for effective water and n savings in practice there is a need for improvement in the management of this technology to make it effective both environmental performance and economic responses need to be considered excessive application or poor management practices can cause pollution in many cases several studies have suggested that drip fertigation has a lower environmental impact than traditional practices while achieving higher crop yield for example zhang et al 2019 and yao et al 2019 demonstrated that drip fertigation decreased n2o and no emissions by 21 8 and 29 8 during the wheat season and by 31 5 and 41 6 during the maize season respectively sharma et al 2012 also demonstrated that drip fertigation could reduce nitrate n deep percolation by 47 5 although it is strongly recommended by the agricultural extension authority in china the development of drip fertigation is still relatively slow due to some practical and technical problems the main reasons are that the size of chinese farms is too small 0 1 0 2 ha each to afford the expenses associated with installation of the drip irrigation system for a single farm in addition there are also some technical problems such as the blockage of nozzles by water with high salt content in some regions fan et al 2014 however if this technology is priced appropriately is easy to install maintain and use and is used with reliable predictions so that farmers can ensure that they are not underwatering then we believe farmers will adopt this technique bourzac 2013 drip fertigation will be a key pathway for the sustainable development of food systems within china and other resource limited regions information derived from this study will be useful for developing relevant policies as well as practical guidance such information also provides a basis for a national or global projection of drip fertigation s potential role in helping to cope with resource limitations we hope that the country specific data and range of scenarios examined in this study can provide a good starting point for this endeavor 4 4 uncertainties and limitations as we mentioned before the major crops for which drip fertigation is used are cotton vegetables wheat and maize in china li 2018 our dataset indicated that many researchers 113 pairwise comparisons studied the effect of drip fertigation on maize yield wp nue and this large dataset provided a good basis for some in depth analysis related to maize however there were relatively few studies and observations to conduct the analysis of the effect of drip fertigation on cotton and potato especially on et and wp this may lead to high or low effectiveness of drip fertigation on cotton and potato the relatively large 95 confidential intervals for estimating potato yield wp nue increase of drip fertigation may also be due to this although the dataset sizes were different the results of our analysis indicated that drip fertigation still had great potential to be explored by optimizing the input of water and n fertilizer to avoid imbalanced datasets and to further derive sound recommendations based on sufficient data from studies we can try to expand the dataset using worldwide publications and then specifically analyze the effect of drip fertigation on potato and or cotton in the future based on theoretical knowledge and the validity of our dataset we considered crop type soil texture map mat n fertilizer rate and irrigation amount as the explanatory variables however other factors e g drip fertigation frequency and fertilizer type may also influence irrigation and or n inputs and the effectiveness of drip fertigation we planned to include these factors in this meta analysis however there are few studies and observations to conduct this analysis in addition it is difficult to group the drip fertigation frequency and fertilizer type when considering all crops further field studies can be carried out to fill these knowledge gaps 5 conclusion our present work aims to obtain a national overview of the productivity of drip fertigation through a holistic evaluation of different crop types under wide ranging conditions and then quantify the water and n saving potentials of drip fertigation for the studied crops to this end we constructed a dataset from 130 relevant research papers published between 1991 and 2019 from 23 provinces municipalities we concluded that drip fertigation is an efficient way to enhance crop productivity with the potential to increase yield 12 0 and enhance wp 26 4 and nue 34 3 however the extent of improvement was highly dependent on crop types and subject to edaphic climatic and managerial factors our results also indicated that under drip fertigation irrigation water input for maize wheat potato tomato and cotton could be further decreased by 14 41 mm 22 87 mm 20 42 mm 20 59 mm and 13 50 mm respectively and n input for maize wheat potato tomato and cotton could be further decreased by 23 68 kg n ha 1 26 88 kg n ha 1 33 60 kg n ha 1 21 117 kg n ha 1 and 23 66 kg n ha 1 respectively with maximizing crop yield per unit irrigation water and n these results provide practical guidelines

10332,groundwater from the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer is an essential resource for agricultural irrigation in arkansas but groundwater from this valuable resource is being withdrawn more rapidly than aquifer recharge in many parts of the state rice accounts for a significant portion of groundwater withdrawn from the aquifer rice is also a high cost crop relative to other field crops this study uses data envelopment analysis and non radial technical efficiency to evaluate irrigation water efficiency along with the efficiency of other key rice production inputs using data from 142 rice fields enrolled in the university of arkansas rice research verification program rrvp the study also evaluates the impacts of management practices on input use efficiency using fractional regression this study differs from most other studies that focus specifically on irrigation water efficiency in that efficiencies of other related rice inputs are also evaluated we found irrigation water was overused on average by 37 3 across the 142 fields with 60 fields 42 3 of all fields evaluated over applying irrigation water by over 50 other rice inputs identified as highly inefficient included herbicides diesel and labor which were overused on average by 46 4 54 6 and 58 9 respectively across the 142 fields results of the fractional regression analysis revealed management practices significantly improving irrigation water efficiency also significantly improved diesel and labor efficiency as well as overall field efficiency keywords data envelopment analysis fractional regression input efficiency irrigation water non radial technical efficiency rice 1 introduction arkansas currently ranks third behind nebraska and california in irrigated cropland area and nearly 80 of all cropland area in arkansas is irrigated usda nass 2014 groundwater is the largest source of irrigation water in arkansas and approximately 94 of all groundwater used for irrigation comes from the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer kresse et al 2014 large groundwater withdrawals are placing significant downward pressure on this economically important source of irrigation water with 45 50 of current groundwater withdrawals from the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer deemed sustainable kresse et al 2014 rice accounts for a significant portion of the groundwater withdrawn from the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer reba et al 2017 rice uses the most water per hectare of any row crop grown in arkansas most rice farmers keep from 75 to 154 mm 3 6 in of standing water on rice fields during the growing season kresse et al 2014 with average annual irrigation water use in rice production totaling 763 mm 30 in during a typical growing season henry et al 2016 improving irrigation efficiency in rice production is thus of paramount importance in arkansas several water conserving irrigation practices have been initiated by rice producers already including construction of tailwater recovery systems and on farm reservoirs utilization of multiple inlet rice irrigation miri with poly pipe and precision land grading land leveling kresse et al 2014 reba et al 2017 rice is also a high cost crop relative to other field crops grown in the u s such as cotton corn soybean and wheat baldwin et al 2011 energy inputs irrigation fuel machinery fuel and nitrogen and herbicides are the primary inputs making rice more costly than other field crops grown in arkansas input prices tend to move in the same direction as commodity prices but input prices tend to lag behind commodity prices in adjustment patrick et al 2016 a larger drop in commodity prices relative to input prices thus leads to narrowing profit margins for rice and other field crops rice is very susceptible to narrowing profit margins due to its high dependence on energy related inputs declining groundwater availability negatively impacts the future sustainability of arkansas rice production and places weight on adoption of production practices that utilize irrigation water more efficiently periods of low farm prices and narrow profit margins also make rice producers in arkansas more dependent on production systems that utilize inputs efficiently this study uses data envelopment analysis dea to measure the technical efficiency te of irrigation water and other inputs used in rice production most dea studies in the literature measure input efficiency for a single production input typically irrigation water chebil et al 2014 frija et al 2009 gadanakis et al 2015 lilienfeld and asmild 2007 njiraini and guthiga 2013 watto and mugera 2014 unlike these studies our study measures irrigation water efficiency as well as efficiencies of other key rice production inputs using a method known as non radial technical efficiency nrte the present study also evaluates the impacts of management practices on input use efficiency using fractional regression data for the study come from 142 fields enrolled in the university of arkansas rice research verification program rrvp for the period 2005 through 2017 2 overview of data envelopment analysis data envelopment analysis is one of two widely used methods in the literature for measuring efficiency among particular decision making units dmus the other widely used method is the stochastic frontier production function approach or sfa coelli 1995 the sfa assumes a functional relationship between outputs and inputs and uses statistical techniques to estimate functional parameters and incorporates an error composed of two additive components a symmetric component that accounts for statistical noise associated with data measurement errors and a non negative component that measures inefficiency in production coelli 1995 the stochastic model specification of sfa also allows for hypothesis testing the disadvantage of sfa is that it imposes specific assumptions on both the functional form of the frontier and the distribution of the error term in contrast data envelopment analysis dea is a nonparametric linear programming lp approach for measuring relative efficiency among a set of dmus because it is nonparametric dea does not require any assumptions to be made about functional form or distribution type it is thus less sensitive to misspecification relative to sfa however the deterministic nature of dea means all deviations from the frontier are attributed to inefficiency it is therefore subject to statistical noises resulting from data measurement errors coelli 1995 we chose the dea approach since it imposes no a priori parametric restriction on the underlying technology chavas and aliber 1993 fletschner and zepeda 2002 lansink et al 2002 wu and prato 2006 the methodology for dea was first proposed by farrell 1957 and was further developed by charnes et al 1978 in the case of constant returns to scale crs and banker et al 1984 in the case of variable returns to scale vrs dea can also be used to measure both radial technical efficiency and non radial technical efficiency the methodology for non radial technical efficiency was formally introduced by f√§re and lovell 1978 and was further developed by f√§re et al 1983 for this study fields enrolled in the university of arkansas rrvp represent dmus let i represent the total number of fields observations each using j variable inputs and m fixed inputs to produce k outputs let x x 1 xj ‚Ñú j denote the vector of variable inputs y y 1 yk ‚Ñú k denote the vector of variable outputs and z z 1 zm ‚Ñú m denote the vector of fixed inputs furthermore let the matrix of observed variable inputs of dimension j i be represented by x the matrix of fixed inputs of dimension m i be represented by z and the matrix of variable outputs of dimension k i be represented by y the production possibilities set satisfying variable returns to scale v and strong disposability of inputs and outputs s 1 1 strong or free disposability means that for a given set of inputs x it is possible to decrease the production of any output by any desired amount or conversely it is possible to produce any given output y with more input resources than is absolutely necessary strong disposability also does not recognize the link between desirable and undesirable outcomes with the latter generally referred to as emissions can be written as the following piecewise linear technology 1 l y v s x y Œª y x Œª x z Œª z Œª r i i 1 i Œª i 1 where Œª Œª1 Œª i is the intensity vector or alternatively the vector of non negative weights to be determined by the solution of the problem charnes et al 1978 the constraint Œª i 1 in eq 1 is a convexity constraint that imposes vrs on the technology when Œª i 1 is omitted crs is imposed on eq 1 2 1 input based radial technical efficiency the input based radial efficiency or the farrell measure is defined as follows 2 e r v s m i n Œª Œ∏ Œ∏ Œ∏ x l y v s where Œ∏ is a scaler 0 Œ∏ 1 measuring the radial technical efficiency of the field with technical inefficiency or overuse of all variable inputs for the field being measured as 1 Œ∏ the scalar dimension of er v s implies that an inefficient field may be made efficient through a reduction of all variable inputs by the same non negative proportion keeping output constant all variable input levels for an inefficient field are reduced by Œ∏ along a ray in input space until the production frontier is reached fernandez cornejo 1994 input based radial efficiency has two desirable features first duality exists between er v s and the input set l y v s er v s is the inverse of the input distance function and as such it contains all the information on the underlying technology l y v s lovell and schmidt 1988 second er v s has a straightforward cost interpretation the radial nature of er v s makes it factor price independent and it can be used to show the potential cost reduction resulting from elimination of technical inefficiency ferrier et al 1994 however er v s has some drawbacks one drawback is that er v s measures technical efficiency relative to an isoquant rather than to an efficient subset and can lead to potentially labeling the input vector technically efficient Œ∏ 1 when it is not f√§re and lovell 1978 lovell and schmidt 1988 another drawback is that the model seeks to obtain the maximum rate of reduction with the same proportion for all inputs used to produce a given level of output or in other words the model results in a radial contraction of all inputs avkiran et al 2008 fernandez cornejo 1994 the input based radial technical efficiency rte is obtained for each field o by solving the following linear programming lp problem 3 r t e o m i n Œª i Œ∏ o Œ∏ o subject to i 1 i Œª i x i j Œ∏ o x o j 0 i 1 i Œª i z i m z o m 0 i 1 i Œª i y i k y o k 0 i 1 i Œª i 1 Œª i 0 where i 1 to i fields j 1 to j variable inputs m 1 to m fixed inputs k 1 to k outputs and all other variables are as previously defined 2 2 input based non radial technical efficiency the input based non radial efficiency or the russell measure is defined as follows 4 e n r v s m i n Œª Œ∏ j 1 j Œ∏ j j Œ∏ 1 x 1 Œ∏ j x j Œ∏ j x j l y v s where j equals the number of nonzero inputs for the field and Œ∏ Œ∏ 1 Œ∏j Œ∏j is the vector of each component Œ∏j that provides a measure of the efficiency in the use of each variable input f√§re and lovell 1978 also show that when x l y and y 0 that the radial measure is greater than or equal to the corresponding non radial measure the non radial model puts aside the assumption of proportionate contraction in inputs and seeks to obtain maximum rates of reduction in inputs that may discard varying proportions of original input resources avkiran et al 2008 molinos senante et al 2014 thus in the context of input overuse the non radial efficiency approach overcomes the drawback of the radial approach in that the non radial approach does not assume a technically inefficient dmu overuses all variable inputs to the same degree fernandez cornejo 1994 however the non radial measure does not possess a factor price invariant cost interpretation of technical efficiency and therefore does not possess a straightforward cost interpretation kopp 1981 the input based non radial technical efficiency nrte is obtained for each field o by solving the following lp problem 5 n r t e o m i n Œª i Œ∏ o j j 1 j Œ∏ o j j subject to i 1 i Œª i x i j Œ∏ o j x o j 0 i 1 i Œª i z i m z o m 0 i 1 i Œª i y i k y o k 0 i 1 i Œª i 1 Œª i 0 0 Œ∏ o j 1 2 3 scale efficiency and determination of returns to scale using dea the radial and non radial dea models discussed thus far assume vrs as indicated earlier crs may be imposed by omitting the convexity constraint Œª i 1 in both eqs 3 and 5 imposing both crs and vrs allows for calculation of scale efficiency scale efficiency se is determined for each field o under rte and nrte respectively as follows 6 s e r t e o r t e c r s o r t e v r s o 7 s e n r t e o n r t e c r s o n r t e v r s o the value for senrteo serteo will be 1 values equal to one means the field is scale efficient while values less than one means the field is scale inefficient with the level of scale inefficiency equal to 1 senrteo 1 serteo scale inefficiency arises due to either increasing returns to scale irs or decreasing returns to scale drs the values derived from eqs 6 and 7 can indicate if the field is scale inefficient but they provide no indication as to whether scale inefficiency arises as a result of irs or drs increasing or decreasing returns to scale may be determined for the field by running the te models in eqs 3 and 5 and replacing Œª i 1 with Œª i 1 the result is te calculated under nonincreasing returns to scale under non radial technical efficiency nrtenirso and radial technical efficiency rtenirso if nrtenirso nrtevrso rtenirso rtevrso the field exhibits drs larger than optimal scale if nrtenirso nrtevrso rtenirso rtevrso the field exhibits irs sub optimal scale finally if nrtecrso ntrevrso rtecrso rtevrso the field exhibits crs coelli et al 2002 fernandez cornejo 1994 3 empirical studies of input use efficiency using dea numerous studies use dea to calculate and evaluate the efficiency of input usage the literature pertaining to input use efficiency analysis with dea may be partitioned into two general classifications 1 sub vector dea focusing on a single input and 2 non radial dea focusing on multiple inputs 3 1 sub vector dea of input use efficiency sub vector dea refers to radial efficiency measured for a sub vector of inputs rather than for the entire vector of inputs sub vector dea was introduced by f√§re et al 1994 as a means for handling situations where some inputs in the input vector are fixed or uncontrollable in the short run 2 2 radial technical efficiency measured in eq 4 of the present study may be considered as sub vector dea in that inputs are segregated into variable and fixed inputs and radial efficiency is measured for the sub vector of variable inputs only however the majority of studies using this methodology focuses on efficiency measurement for one input only holding all other inputs and outputs constant sub vector dea in these studies uses the following lp model specification 8 s v e o m i n Œª i Œ∏ o t Œ∏ o t subject to i 1 i Œª i x i j t x o j t 0 i 1 i Œª i x i t Œ∏ o t x o t 0 i 1 i Œª i y i k y o k 0 i 1 i Œª i 1 Œª i 0 where Œ∏o t is the sub vector efficiency sveo obtained for input t and dmu o and all other variables are as previously defined Œ∏o t in eq 9 can take on a value between 0 and 1 with overuse of the input measured as 1 Œ∏o t input use efficiency studies using sub vector dea are presented in table 1 water is a limited or finite agricultural resource for much of the world thus the majority of studies in table 1 focuses exclusively on water efficiency either irrigation water use efficie 3 3 water use efficiency in our analysis and in other dea studies differs from other measures often used in the literature whereas many studies use an absolute measure kg yield per m3 us dollars per m3 water use efficiency in this study is measured in relative terms or percentages the efficiency measure Œ∏j is between 0 and 1 with inefficiency defined as 1 Œ∏j ncy or groundwater use efficiency we refer the reader to pereir and marques 2017 for a more in depth survey of dea studies dealing with irrigation water efficiency most studies estimate both rte and sve for each dmu and seek to compare rte to sve using one or more types of statistical measures pearson correlations cumulative distributions paired sample t tests many studies also evaluate efficiency under both vrs and crs specifications studies that do not evaluate efficiency under both returns to scale specifications assume the vrs specification lilienfeld and asmild 2007 manjunatha et al 2011 njiraini and guthiga 2013 varghese et al 2013 and watto and mugera 2014 2015 zhengfei and lansink 2003 one study watto and mugera 2014 segregates dmus into those exhibiting constant returns to scale crs decreasing returns to scale drs and increasing returns to scale irs 3 2 non radial dea of input use efficiency unlike the sub vector dea efficiency studies mentioned above which shrinks only one input holding everything else constant input based non radial dea efficiency studies shrink all inputs contained in the input vector as much as possible until the frontier is reached input use efficiency studies using non radial dea are presented in table 2 studies using input based non radial dea are more varied in topic relative to the sub vector dea studies however most non radial dea studies like their sub vector counterparts evaluate rte also comparing rte scores to nrte scores and often demonstrating rte nrte as shown by f√§re and lovell 1978 most non radial dea studies evaluate efficiency under vrs with two studies fernandez cornejo 1994 piesse et al 2002 segregating dmus into those exhibiting crs drs and irs 4 data used in the dea analysis input use efficiency scores are calculated for arkansas rice production using data from fields enrolled in the university of arkansas rice research verification program rrvp the rrvp was established in 1983 by the university of arkansas system division of agriculture s cooperative extension service ces to verify the profitability of ces recommendations in fields with less than optimum yields or returns baker et al 2018 these fields often differ in management from a grower s other fields as the grower is being shown how to manage based on ces rice production recommendations the grower supplies field data sheets that include all equipment field operations and custom operations used on each field as well as the types and quantities of inputs used seed fertilizers pesticides etc this information is then used as input in the university of aransas interactive budget spreadsheets to calculate returns and expenses for each field from 1983 2017 the rrvp has been conducted on 461 commercial rice fields in 33 rice producing counties in arkansas baker et al 2018 different fields are enrolled into the program each year with few fields occurring in consecutive years of the program output and input data for the dea analysis were obtained from 142 rice fields enrolled in the rrvp for the period 2005 2017 and summary statistics for these data are presented in table 3 the period 2005 2017 was chosen because rice management practices and varieties have remained fairly steady over this time frame only fields with irrigation water usage measured by flow meters were included in the study output for the dea analysis is measured as the value of rice production rice yield x milling yield adjusted rice price x field size inputs for the dea analysis are partitioned into variable and fixed inputs variable inputs include irrigation water m3 nitrogen kg herbicides diesel l labor hours and other inputs the other inputs category includes costs for seed insecticide fungicide phosphorus potassium other soil amendments chicken litter zinc urease inhibitors and custom applications many inputs in the other inputs category are used on an as needed basis fixed inputs for the dea analysis include field size ha and fixed expenses fixed expenses comprise of capital recovery expenses for machinery and irrigation equipment all monetary variables rice production value herbicides other inputs and fixed expenses are adjusted to 2017 dollars using the producer price index 5 fractional regression regression analysis was conducted to determine the impacts of alternative rice varieties and irrigation management on input efficiencies the standard approach used by most efficiency studies is the censored two limit tobit model which places limits at zero and unity to model efficiency scores however use of the two limit tobit model is questionable in that the accumulation of observations at unity in dea studies is a consequence of how dea scores are defined rather than the result of censoring ramalho et al 2010 dea scores are fractional or proportional and not generated by a censoring data generating process mcdonald 2009 in addition the domain of the two limit tobit model differs from that of dea scores because efficiency scores of zero are typically not observed ramalho et al 2010 given that dea scores are fractional or proportional and are mapped onto the interval 0 1 hoff 2007 and mcdonald 2009 considered the use of papke and wooldridge s 1996 fractional regression model the fractional regression model requires the assumption of a functional form for y the efficiency score that imposes the desired constraints on the conditional mean of the dependent variable as follows 9 e y x g x Œ∏ where g is some nonlinear function satisfying 0 g 1 papke and woodridge 1996 suggest as possible specifications for g any cumulative distribution function such as those commonly used to model binary data the most widely used functions are the symmetric logit and probit functional forms g xŒ∏ e xŒ∏ 1 e xŒ∏ and g xŒ∏ œÜ xŒ∏ respectively however other asymmetric alternatives also exist such as the loglog and complementary loglog or cloglog functional forms g xŒ∏ e e x Œ∏ and g xŒ∏ 1 e e x Œ∏ respectively ramalho et al 2010 the explanatory variables used in the fractional regression analysis are listed in table 4 explanatory variables include the location in which the field was enrolled northeast arkansas central east arkansas southeast arkansas non eastern arkansas the variety type used on the field conventional medium grain clearfield hybrid clearfield hybrid the water source for the field groundwater surface water the irrigation method chosen for the field contour levee with no miri contour levee with miri straight levee with no miri straight levee with miri zero grade furrow irrigation and the energy source used to power the irrigation pump for the field diesel electric all explanatory variables are zero one dummy variables one if the field was located in northeast arkansas zero otherwise one if the field was planted to a conventional long grain rice variety zero otherwise etc location dummy variables are based on usda national agricultural statistical service nass statistical reporting districts 3 northeast arkansas 6 central east arkansas and 9 southeast arkansas over 97 percent of all rice acres are planted in these collective statistical reporting districts non eastern arkansas includes fields located in statistical reporting districts other than districts 3 6 or 9 rice producers have the choice of planting a range of rice variety types including conventional public varieties clearfield varieties hybrid varieties and clearfield hybrid combinations nalley et al 2009 conventional varieties include both long and medium grain variety types these variety types differ in the size and shape of the kernel with long grain rice having a longer more slender kernel than medium grain rice clearfield varieties are resistant to imidazolinone herbicides and allow for greater control of red rice without killing rice growing in the field hybrids provide greater disease resistance higher yields and use less nitrogen relative to conventional varieties clearfield hybrids combine the red rice control of clearfield lines with the higher yielding and disease resistant traits of hybrids as mentioned earlier groundwater is the primary source of irrigation water in arkansas kresse et al 2014 and 73 of rice production area in the state is supplied with groundwater via wells with the remaining 27 supplied by surface water sources such as on farm reservoirs streams and rivers hardke 2018 seventy six percent of the 142 fields in the study receive water from wells groundwater while 24 of the fields receive water from surface water sources table 4 rice producers in arkansas currently use a combination of both diesel and electric pumps to supply irrigation water for rice production many arkansas rice producers converted from diesel to electric pumps in the latter 2000s due to lower installation costs for electric pumps relative to diesel pumps and lower per unit pumping costs for electric pumps relative to diesel pumps forty six of the 142 fields in the study 32 use electric pumps while 96 fields 68 use diesel pumps to apply irrigation water to rice rice field topography varies across arkansas depending on the amount of precision land grading conducted on each field levees are generally spaced at 0 1 0 3 ft per 100 ft 0 2 grade so rice fields have very little topographical relief and are constructed and destructed annually contour levees are created by following the natural grade of unimproved land resulting in irregularly shaped levees with many different sizes contour levee fields account for over 48 of rice acres in arkansas hardke 2018 fifty out of 142 rice fields in the study have contour levees table 4 an estimated 38 of arkansas rice acres are precision leveled to some degree hardke 2018 with most fields graded to a 0 05 to 0 2 slope precision land grading involves reforming the grade of the land at great expense to create a field with constant cross slope and nearly constant downslope resulting in levees that are of equal size and square in nature sixty seven of the 142 fields in the analysis have straight or nearly straight levees table 4 some rice fields in arkansas are leveled to a zero slope and are referred to as zero grade rice fields zero grade rice accounts for approximately 14 of planted rice acres in arkansas hardke 2018 zero grade rice production eliminates the need to build levees each year and results in significantly less irrigation and fuel when compared with contour levee rice production twenty one of the 142 fields in the study are zero grade fields table 4 a small number of rice acres in arkansas approximately 3 5 are managed using furrow irrigation hardke 2018 furrow irrigated rice or row rice management refers to planting rice on raised beds water is applied in the furrows between beds to maintain adequate soil moisture four of the 142 rice fields in the study are furrow irrigated fields multiple inlet rice irrigation accompanies many contour and straight levee rice fields in arkansas multiple inlet rice irrigation miri uses poly pipe to distribute irrigation water to all paddies simultaneously this differs from conventional flood irrigation in which water is applied to the first paddy at the top of the field and then flows over spills to lower paddies until the entire field is flooded vories et al 2005 multiple inlet irrigation allows the field to be flooded much faster than conventional flood irrigation water savings can be achieved using miri over conventional flood irrigation because the field is flooded quicker and irrigation efficiency is increased through reduced pumping time during the season other possible benefits of miri include reduced irrigation labor and possible higher grain yields vories et al 2005 multiple inlet rice irrigation is used on approximately 33 of all rice area in arkansas hardke 2018 and is used on 42 of the 142 rice fields evaluated in this study 14 contour levee rice fields and 28 straight levee rice fields with miri table 4 6 results 6 1 overall field efficiency scores summary statistics of overall field efficiencies radial technical efficiency non radial technical efficiency are presented in table 5 the lindo what s best spreadsheet solver was used to conduct the dea linear programming analysis for each field in the study lindo systems 2018 radial and non radial technical efficiency scores are presented under both crs and vrs for comparison the mean radial technical efficiency scores under crs rtecrs and vrs rtevrs are 0 696 and 0 740 respectively in contrast the mean non radial technical efficiency scores under crs nrtecrs and vrs nrtevrs are 0 535 and 0 596 respectively these statistics demonstrate what is shown in f√§re and lovell 1978 namely that the radial measure of technical efficiency is greater than or equal to the corresponding non radial measure of technical efficiency in both instances fields enrolled in the rrvp are technically inefficient on average with average inefficiencies for the radial measure ranging from 0 304 crs to 0 260 vrs and average inefficiencies for the non radial measure ranging from 0 465 crs to 0 404 vrs scale efficiency summary statistics for both radial and non radial technical efficiency are also presented in table 5 the mean scale efficiency under radial technical efficiency serte is 0 943 and the mean scale efficiency under non radial technical efficiency senrte is 0 900 both measures indicate the rrvp fields are scale inefficient on average with average scale inefficiency ranging from 0 057 for the radial measure to 0 100 for the non radial measure most of the scale inefficiency for the rrvp fields is due to drs table 6 over 59 of the 142 fields exhibit drs for the radial measure while nearly 82 of the 142 fields exhibit drs under the non radial measure table 6 these statistics indicate most fields in the study are operating at larger than optimal field sizes the average field size for fields exhibiting crs optimum size is 17 4 ha 43 1 ac for both radial and non radial measures in contrast the average field size for fields exhibiting drs larger than optimum size is 25 5 ha 62 9 ac under the radial measure and 22 8 ha 56 4 ac under the non radial measure finally the average size of fields exhibiting irs smaller than optimum size is 15 1 ha 37 4 ac for the radial measure and 12 7 ha 31 5 ac for the non radial measure 6 2 field and input efficiency scores under variable returns to scale summary statistics of field and input efficiencies are presented in table 7 results are presented under vrs because the majority of fields in the study exhibit varying rather than constant returns to scale overall field efficiency nrtevrs in table 7 is calculated as the sum of each individual efficiency score for the field divided by the number of inputs the contribution of each input to overall field efficiency can be evaluated with inputs having higher lower input efficiencies contributing more less to overall field efficiency irrigation water is the third largest contributor to overall efficiency with an average efficiency of 0 627 other inputs and nitrogen contribute more to overall efficiency than irrigation water average efficiencies of 0 801 and 0 749 for other inputs and nitrogen respectively table 7 in contrast labor diesel and herbicides contribute less to overall efficiency than irrigation water average efficiencies of 0 411 0 454 and 0 536 for labor diesel and herbicides respectively table 7 all rice inputs in table 7 exhibit inefficiencies on average average irrigation water inefficiency across all 142 fields is 0 373 indicating irrigation water is over applied on average by 37 3 labor is the most inefficient input overused on average by 58 9 while other inputs is the least inefficient input overused on average by 19 9 6 3 distributions of efficiency scores distributions of field and input efficiency scores under vrs are reported by efficiency range in table 8 a field or a particular input exhibits efficiency if its efficiency score is equal to one only 22 of the 142 fields evaluated 15 5 are efficient in all inputs nrtevrs 1 thirty four fields 23 9 are efficient in irrigation water application 36 fields 25 4 are efficient in nitrogen application 49 fields 34 5 are efficient in other inputs application 25 fields 17 6 are efficient in herbicide application and 22 fields 15 5 are efficient in both diesel and labor usage the majority of fields in the study exhibit some level of input inefficiency input efficiency scores 1 for example 76 1 of fields are inefficient in irrigation water application 82 4 are inefficient in herbicide application and 84 5 of fields are inefficient in both diesel and labor usage sixty fields out of 148 42 3 have irrigation water efficiencies less than 0 5 indicating that a large portion of the fields are over applying irrigation water by over 50 however the incidence of input over application is much greater for other key rice inputs such as herbicides diesel and labor input efficiency scores for these key rice inputs are below 0 5 for the majority of fields evaluated in the study 59 8 of fields have herbicide efficiencies less than 0 5 72 6 of fields have diesel efficiencies less than 0 5 and 75 3 of fields have labor efficiencies less than 0 5 table 8 other inputs and nitrogen have the lowest numbers of fields with efficiency scores less than 0 5 21 1 of fields with other input efficiency scores less than 0 5 27 4 of fields with nitrogen efficiency scores less than 0 5 table 8 6 4 efficiency score correlations pairwise correlations of input efficiencies are presented in table 9 all input efficiencies are significant and positively correlated with one another and with overall field efficiency nrtevrs implying that increasing the efficiency of one input will also increase the efficiency of other inputs as well as the overall field efficiency however some inputs have larger numeric correlations with overall field efficiency than others diesel efficiency labor efficiency herbicide efficiency and irrigation water efficiency are more strongly correlated with overall field efficiency 0 941 0 933 0 901 and 0 831 respectively than are nitrogen efficiency and other inputs efficiency 0 558 and 0 774 respectively these results suggest greater potential for increasing overall field efficiency by increasing diesel labor herbicide and irrigation water efficiencies diesel efficiency and labor efficiency have the strongest numeric correlation with one another 0 985 both inputs are directly related to field operations and thus their efficiencies are highly correlated irrigation water efficiency has a stronger numeric correlation with diesel and labor efficiency than with the other remaining inputs these findings provide evidence that management practices increasing irrigation water efficiency also tend to increase diesel and labor efficiencies 6 5 results of the fractional regression analysis four functional forms were considered for each efficiency measure 1 logit 2 probit 3 loglog and 4 complementary loglog or cloglog ramalho et al 2010 list some general tests for detecting the correct specification of functional form of the conditional mean e y x these tests include the reset test where polynomials in the fitted xŒ∏ are included in g to detect general kinds of functional form misspecification goodness of function form tests goff i and goff ii tests based on generalized functional forms which encompass g and the p test proposed by davidson and mackinnon 1981 which is used to compare nonlinear regression models to one another this study employed all four tests to determine the appropriate functional form for each input efficiency all four models were estimated and tested using stata version 15 statacorp 2017 and stata modules for estimating and testing fractional regression models obtained from ramalho 2014 variables omitted from each model include central east arkansas conventional groundwater contour levees no miri and diesel the effects of these variables are captured in the intercept of each model specification tests for selecting among the four fractional regression models are presented in table 10 in nearly all instances the reset test and goff i and goff ii tests reveal the four models fit the data appropriately exceptions were the logit and loglog functional forms which were miss specified for overall field efficiency nrtevrs based on the goff i test and the goff ii test respectively and the loglog model which was miss specified for diesel efficiency based on both the reset and the goff ii tests table 10 the p test revealed the cloglog model was the preferred functional form for nrtevrs irrigation water efficiency and herbicide efficiency and indicated the logit probit and cloglog models were all superior to the loglog model specification for diesel efficiency the p tests did not indicate a superior model specification for nitrogen efficiency labor efficiency and other inputs efficiency and did not indicate a superior model specification between the logit probit and cloglog models for diesel efficiency two additional statistics the akaike information criterion aic and the bayesian information criterion bic were used to determine the functional form that seemed to have the best fit for these efficiency measures souza and gomes 2015 based on these tests the functional form that seemed to fit nitrogen efficiency best was the loglog and the functional form that seemed to fit diesel efficiency labor efficiency and other inputs efficiency best was the cloglog estimated coefficients for selected fractional regression models of each efficiency measure are presented in table 11 the cloglog model was chosen for all efficiency models except nitrogen efficiency the loglog model was chosen for nitrogen efficiency regional variables were insignificant in all but one instance non eastern arkansas was negative and significant for nitrogen efficiency indicating rice fields located outside of eastern arkansas were less efficient in nitrogen application than fields located within eastern arkansas the type of variety planted has a significant impact on most efficiency measures medium grain has a positive and significant impact on all efficiency scores except other inputs efficiency medium grain rice tends to be higher yielding and often receives a price premium relative to conventional long grain rice varieties in most production years hybrid and clearfield hybrid have a positive and significant impact on all efficiency scores except herbicide efficiency non significant and other inputs efficiency negative and significant hybrid type rice varieties tend to yield higher than conventional rice varieties on marginal fields hybrid and clearfield hybrid along with clearfield have significantly negative effects on other inputs efficiency because of the higher seed cost for these varieties relative to non clearfield non hybrid varieties the water source for the field surface water versus ground water has no significant impacts on efficiency scores however the type of irrigation pump used on the field diesel electric had a significant impact on most efficiency scores electric pumps significantly reduced all efficiency measures with the exception of nitrogen efficiency implying fields using electric pumps overuse nearly all rice production inputs relative to fields using diesel pumps the type of irrigation method used significantly impacted most efficiency scores adding miri to contour and straight levee fields significantly increases nrtevrs irrigation water efficiency diesel efficiency and labor efficiency straight levee fields without miri significantly increases nrtevrs diesel efficiency labor efficiency and other inputs efficiency zero grade fields significantly increase all efficiency scores furrow irrigation has a significant negative impact on herbicide efficiency but has no significant impact on any other efficiency measures 7 discussion and implications this study provides strong evidence of inefficiency of input application in arkansas rice production the study used dea analysis and non radial technical efficiency to measure the technical efficiency of irrigation water and other major production inputs used on 142 fields enrolled in the university of arkansas rrvp the study found these fields to be technically inefficient on average with average overall inefficiency measured at 40 4 some inputs are used more inefficiently than other inputs rice inputs identified as being used more inefficiently included herbicides diesel and labor herbicides were overused on average by 46 4 while diesel and labor were overused on average by 54 6 and 58 9 respectively irrigation water was overused on average by 37 3 across the 142 rrvp fields this value falls within the range of irrigation water overuse values found in other dea studies involving rice 17 0 in azad et al 2015 44 0 in varghese et al 2013 31 9 in veettlil et al 2011 20 4 and 22 1 for tube well owners and water buyers respectively in watto and mugera 2014 the amount of water over application in our study was significant in many instances over 42 of the rrvp fields over applied irrigation water by over 50 the results of this study highlight the need to improve input efficiencies particularly irrigation water efficiency in arkansas rice production groundwater used for agriculture is becoming more limiting in many parts of arkansas where rice is heavily grown and improving irrigation water efficiencies on a field level would help mitigate this problem increased irrigation water efficiency at the field level also has environmental implications improved irrigation water efficiency on rice fields results in less water return flow from fields which in turn reduces the potential for release of harmful chemicals and excess nutrients into rivers streams and estuarine systems the study evaluated the influence of various management practices on input efficiencies using fractional regression rice variety selection was found to strongly impact input and field efficiencies rice varieties exhibiting high grain yields medium grain rice hybrids and clearfield hybrids had significantly positive impacts on most efficiency measures medium grain rice had a significantly positive impact on all efficiency measures except other inputs efficiency however the applicability of planting medium grain rice in arkansas is limited by market demand few growers raise medium grain rice in arkansas with planted area typically fluctuating slightly above or below 87 937 ha 200 000 ac in any given year hybrid and clearfield hybrid rice varieties have a significantly positive impact on overall field efficiency irrigation water efficiency nitrogen efficiency diesel efficiency and labor efficiency hybrid type varieties have good disease resistance use less nitrogen and tend to work better on marginal fields relative to conventional long grain varieties nalley et al 2014 also found increased water efficiency with hybrid type varieties due to a shorter growing season and thus less time under a flood for these variety types relative to conventional varieties management practices aimed at improving water flow across fields strongly impacts input efficiencies and overall field efficiency fields with straight levees have a significantly positive impact on overall field efficiency diesel efficiency labor efficiency and other inputs efficiency laughlin and mehrle 1996 report straight levee fields tend to be more efficient in labor and machinery due to less levee construction and destruction relative to contour levee fields laughlin and mehrle 1996 they also found greater harvest efficiency with combines for straight levee fields due to greater ease of movement across fields and also a higher incidence of input application with ground equipment relative to aerial application on straight levee fields relative to contour levee fields thus allowing for more timely and effective input application fields leveled to a zero grade significantly increased all efficiency measures in our study land preparation expenses are much lower for zero grade fields relative to either contour or straight levee fields because zero grade fields contain no levees watkins et al 2007 the absence of levees on zero grade fields also increases the harvest efficiency of combines watkins et al 2007 henry et al 2016 also found significant water savings comparing zero grade fields to both contour and straight levee fields water savings occur because these fields can be quickly flooded up and the depth of the flood can be maintained consistently across the field the primary disadvantages of zero grade are the initial capital cost of precision grading a field to a zero slope watkins et al 2007 potentially lower rice yields on cut areas during the initial years after the land improvement watkins et al 2007 and poor drainage of zero grade fields relative to sloping fields henry et al 2016 poor drainage limits the ability to rotate rice with other crops like soybeans compelling most producers to grow continuous rice on zero grade fields henry et al 2016 because of its limitations the use of zero grade management is relatively low accounting for slightly over 14 of arkansas rice area in 2017 hardke 2018 furrow irrigation had a significant negative impact on herbicide efficiency in our study which is an expected result since furrow irrigated rice fields tend to have more weed pressures and require more herbicide inputs relative to flooded rice fields however all other efficiency measures were not significantly impacted by furrow irrigation in our study which was likely due to the small number of fields in our analysis using this system of management fields with miri have a significantly positive impact on overall field efficiency irrigation water efficiency diesel efficiency and labor efficiency in our study the positive impact of miri on input and field efficiencies may be due to increased grain yields and increased water savings with miri henry et al 2016 found significantly larger grain yields on fields utilizing miri relative to fields without miri the authors speculated miri may allow for more equal distribution of cold water and bicarbonate found in many arkansas wells distributing both across the field rather than concentrating both at the top of the field the authors also speculated the higher yields for fields using miri may be due to faster flooding up of rice fields thus reducing nitrogen volatilization and hastening herbicide activation we also found higher rice grain yields on fields with miri interestingly henry et al 2016 found no water savings associated with fields using miri these results differ from vories et al 2005 which found miri used 24 less irrigation water than conventionally flooding this discrepancy in findings is likely due to the way field comparisons are made in the two studies vories et al 2005 compared paired fields with and without miri that were in close proximity to one another utilized the same management practices and consisted of the same soil type henry et al 2016 does not make such comparisons rice fields with and without miri in henry et al 2016 are independent to one another vary in management and are not in close proximity to one another thus henry et al 2016 concludes there may be more potential water savings with miri than is indicated in their study over one third of rice area in arkansas utilized miri in 2017 hardke 2018 indicating potential for expanded use of miri in arkansas rice production the water source for the field surface water versus ground water has no significant impacts on any efficiency measure henry et al 2016 found fields supplied with surface water used significantly less irrigation water relative to fields supplied with groundwater in our study surface water had a positive impact on most efficiency measures including irrigation water efficiency but in no instance was the impact of surface water found to be significant the use of electric pumps relative to diesel pumps was found to have a significant negative effect on all efficiency measures except nitrogen efficiency this result is due largely to relative differences in field topographies using the two pump types in our study forty six percent of fields with electric pumps had contour levees compared with 31 of fields with diesel pumps in contrast 52 of fields using diesel pumps were straight levee fields compared with 37 of fields using electric pumps moreover a larger proportion of straight levee fields with diesel pumps also utilized miri 47 relative to straight levee fields with electric pumps 24 utilized miri finally we found a lower proportion of electric pump fields having zero grade relative to diesel pump fields fifty seven percent of the zero grade fields in our study used diesel pumps compared with 38 using electric pumps 8 conclusions groundwater from the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer is an essential resource for the sustainability of agricultural production in arkansas but this valuable resource is being withdrawn more rapidly than the aquifer can be recharged in many parts of the state rice accounts for a significant portion of groundwater withdrawn from the aquifer this study evaluates irrigation water efficiency in rice production along with the efficiency of other key rice production inputs using data from 142 rice fields enrolled in the university of arkansas rice research verification program rrvp this study differs from most other studies focusing specifically on irrigation water efficiency in that efficiencies of other related rice inputs are also evaluated the findings reveal irrigation water was overused on average by 37 3 across the 142 fields and many fields in the study over applied irrigation water in excess of 50 clearly there is a need to improve the efficiency of irrigation water application in arkansas rice production based on our results this study provides evidence that rice variety choice can influence irrigation water efficiency medium grain rice and hybrid type rice varieties improved irrigation water efficiency relative to conventional long grain varieties we also found hybrid type and medium grain varieties increased nitrogen efficiency diesel efficiency and labor efficiency relative to conventional long grain varieties medium grain and hybrid type varieties tend to be higher yielding than conventional long grain varieties particularly on marginal fields fields enrolled in the rrvp tend to be marginal in nature and tend to have less than optimum yields and returns arkansas rice producers have adopted several management practices to improve irrigation water efficiency in rice production these include construction of tail water pits and on farm reservoirs precision land grading to improve the flow of water across fields straight levees and zero grade management and multiple inlet rice irrigation miri which uses poly pipe to distribute irrigation water to all rice paddies simultaneously an important finding of this study is that adoption of many of these irrigation management practices improves the application efficiency of other key rice production inputs in addition to irrigation water such as diesel and labor thus management practices aimed at improving irrigation water efficiency also improve efficiency of other key rice production inputs leading to improved profit margins for rice producers this latter point is significant because rice is a high cost crop relative to other field crops grown in arkansas and is very susceptible to narrowing profit margins arising from low rice prices combined with high input costs declaration of competing interest the authors reported no declarations of interest acknowledgements the authors gratefully

10332,groundwater from the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer is an essential resource for agricultural irrigation in arkansas but groundwater from this valuable resource is being withdrawn more rapidly than aquifer recharge in many parts of the state rice accounts for a significant portion of groundwater withdrawn from the aquifer rice is also a high cost crop relative to other field crops this study uses data envelopment analysis and non radial technical efficiency to evaluate irrigation water efficiency along with the efficiency of other key rice production inputs using data from 142 rice fields enrolled in the university of arkansas rice research verification program rrvp the study also evaluates the impacts of management practices on input use efficiency using fractional regression this study differs from most other studies that focus specifically on irrigation water efficiency in that efficiencies of other related rice inputs are also evaluated we found irrigation water was overused on average by 37 3 across the 142 fields with 60 fields 42 3 of all fields evaluated over applying irrigation water by over 50 other rice inputs identified as highly inefficient included herbicides diesel and labor which were overused on average by 46 4 54 6 and 58 9 respectively across the 142 fields results of the fractional regression analysis revealed management practices significantly improving irrigation water efficiency also significantly improved diesel and labor efficiency as well as overall field efficiency keywords data envelopment analysis fractional regression input efficiency irrigation water non radial technical efficiency rice 1 introduction arkansas currently ranks third behind nebraska and california in irrigated cropland area and nearly 80 of all cropland area in arkansas is irrigated usda nass 2014 groundwater is the largest source of irrigation water in arkansas and approximately 94 of all groundwater used for irrigation comes from the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer kresse et al 2014 large groundwater withdrawals are placing significant downward pressure on this economically important source of irrigation water with 45 50 of current groundwater withdrawals from the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer deemed sustainable kresse et al 2014 rice accounts for a significant portion of the groundwater withdrawn from the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer reba et al 2017 rice uses the most water per hectare of any row crop grown in arkansas most rice farmers keep from 75 to 154 mm 3 6 in of standing water on rice fields during the growing season kresse et al 2014 with average annual irrigation water use in rice production totaling 763 mm 30 in during a typical growing season henry et al 2016 improving irrigation efficiency in rice production is thus of paramount importance in arkansas several water conserving irrigation practices have been initiated by rice producers already including construction of tailwater recovery systems and on farm reservoirs utilization of multiple inlet rice irrigation miri with poly pipe and precision land grading land leveling kresse et al 2014 reba et al 2017 rice is also a high cost crop relative to other field crops grown in the u s such as cotton corn soybean and wheat baldwin et al 2011 energy inputs irrigation fuel machinery fuel and nitrogen and herbicides are the primary inputs making rice more costly than other field crops grown in arkansas input prices tend to move in the same direction as commodity prices but input prices tend to lag behind commodity prices in adjustment patrick et al 2016 a larger drop in commodity prices relative to input prices thus leads to narrowing profit margins for rice and other field crops rice is very susceptible to narrowing profit margins due to its high dependence on energy related inputs declining groundwater availability negatively impacts the future sustainability of arkansas rice production and places weight on adoption of production practices that utilize irrigation water more efficiently periods of low farm prices and narrow profit margins also make rice producers in arkansas more dependent on production systems that utilize inputs efficiently this study uses data envelopment analysis dea to measure the technical efficiency te of irrigation water and other inputs used in rice production most dea studies in the literature measure input efficiency for a single production input typically irrigation water chebil et al 2014 frija et al 2009 gadanakis et al 2015 lilienfeld and asmild 2007 njiraini and guthiga 2013 watto and mugera 2014 unlike these studies our study measures irrigation water efficiency as well as efficiencies of other key rice production inputs using a method known as non radial technical efficiency nrte the present study also evaluates the impacts of management practices on input use efficiency using fractional regression data for the study come from 142 fields enrolled in the university of arkansas rice research verification program rrvp for the period 2005 through 2017 2 overview of data envelopment analysis data envelopment analysis is one of two widely used methods in the literature for measuring efficiency among particular decision making units dmus the other widely used method is the stochastic frontier production function approach or sfa coelli 1995 the sfa assumes a functional relationship between outputs and inputs and uses statistical techniques to estimate functional parameters and incorporates an error composed of two additive components a symmetric component that accounts for statistical noise associated with data measurement errors and a non negative component that measures inefficiency in production coelli 1995 the stochastic model specification of sfa also allows for hypothesis testing the disadvantage of sfa is that it imposes specific assumptions on both the functional form of the frontier and the distribution of the error term in contrast data envelopment analysis dea is a nonparametric linear programming lp approach for measuring relative efficiency among a set of dmus because it is nonparametric dea does not require any assumptions to be made about functional form or distribution type it is thus less sensitive to misspecification relative to sfa however the deterministic nature of dea means all deviations from the frontier are attributed to inefficiency it is therefore subject to statistical noises resulting from data measurement errors coelli 1995 we chose the dea approach since it imposes no a priori parametric restriction on the underlying technology chavas and aliber 1993 fletschner and zepeda 2002 lansink et al 2002 wu and prato 2006 the methodology for dea was first proposed by farrell 1957 and was further developed by charnes et al 1978 in the case of constant returns to scale crs and banker et al 1984 in the case of variable returns to scale vrs dea can also be used to measure both radial technical efficiency and non radial technical efficiency the methodology for non radial technical efficiency was formally introduced by f√§re and lovell 1978 and was further developed by f√§re et al 1983 for this study fields enrolled in the university of arkansas rrvp represent dmus let i represent the total number of fields observations each using j variable inputs and m fixed inputs to produce k outputs let x x 1 xj ‚Ñú j denote the vector of variable inputs y y 1 yk ‚Ñú k denote the vector of variable outputs and z z 1

and the matrix of variable outputs of dimension k i be represented by y the production possibilities set satisfying variable returns to scale v and strong disposability of inputs and outputs s 1 1 strong or free disposability means that for a given set of inputs x it is possible to decrease the production of any output by any desired amount or conversely it is possible to produce any given output y with more input resources than is absolutely necessary strong disposability also does not recognize the link between desirable and undesirable outcomes with the latter generally referred to as emissions can be written as the following piecewise linear technology 1 l y v s x y Œª y x Œª x z Œª z Œª r i i 1 i Œª i 1 where Œª Œª1 Œª i is the intensity vector or alternatively the vector of non negative weights to be determined by the solution of the problem charnes et al 1978 the constraint Œª i 1 in eq 1 is a convexity constraint that imposes vrs on the technology when Œª i 1 is omitted crs is imposed on eq 1 2 1 input based radial technical efficiency the input based radial efficiency or the farrell measure is defined as follows 2 e r v s m i n Œª Œ∏ Œ∏ Œ∏ x l y v s where Œ∏ is a scaler 0 Œ∏ 1 measuring the radial technical efficiency of the field with technical inefficiency or overuse of all variable inputs for the field being measured as 1 Œ∏ the scalar dimension of er v s implies that an inefficient field may be made efficient through a reduction of all variable inputs by the same non negative proportion keeping output constant all variable input levels for an inefficient field are reduced by Œ∏ along a ray in input space until the production frontier is reached fernandez cornejo 1994 input based radial efficiency has two desirable features first duality exists between er v s and the input set l y v s er v s is the inverse of the input distance function and as such it contains all the information on the underlying technology l y v s lovell and schmidt 1988 second er v s has a straightforward cost interpretation the radial nature of er v s makes it factor price independent and it can be used to show the potential cost reduction resulting from elimination of technical inefficiency ferrier et al 1994 however er v s has some drawbacks one drawback is that er v s measures technical efficiency relative to an isoquant rather than to an efficient subset and can lead to potentially labeling the input vector technically efficient Œ∏ 1 when it is not f√§re and lovell 1978 lovell and schmidt 1988 another drawback is that the model seeks to obtain the maximum rate of reduction with the same proportion for all inputs used to produce a given level of output or in other words the model results in a radial contraction of all inputs avkiran et al 2008 fernandez cornejo 1994 the input based radial technical efficiency rte is obtained for each field o by solving the following linear programming lp problem 3 r t e o m i n Œª i Œ∏ o Œ∏ o subject to i 1 i Œª i x i j Œ∏ o x o j 0 i 1 i Œª i z i m z o m 0 i 1 i Œª i y i k y o k 0 i 1 i Œª i 1 Œª i 0 where i 1 to i fields j 1 to j variable inputs m 1 to m fixed inputs k 1 to k outputs and all other variables are as previously defined 2 2 input based non radial technical efficiency the input based non radial efficiency or the russell measure is defined as follows 4 e n r v s m i n Œª Œ∏ j 1 j Œ∏ j j Œ∏ 1 x 1 Œ∏ j x j Œ∏ j x j l y v s where j equals the number of nonzero inputs for the field and Œ∏ Œ∏ 1 Œ∏j Œ∏j is the vector of each component Œ∏j that provides a measure of the efficiency in the use of each variable input f√§re and lovell 1978 also show that when x l y and y 0 that the radial measure is greater than or equal to the corresponding non radial measure the non radial model puts aside the assumption of proportionate contraction in inputs and seeks to obtain maximum rates of reduction in inputs that may discard varying proportions of original input resources avkiran et al 2008 molinos senante et al 2014 thus in the context of input overuse the non radial efficiency approach overcomes the drawback of the radial approach in that the non radial approach does not assume a technically inefficient dmu overuses all variable inputs to the same degree fernandez cornejo 1994 however the non radial measure does not possess a factor price invariant cost interpretation of technical efficiency and therefore does not possess a straightforward cost interpretation kopp 1981 the input based non radial technical efficiency nrte is obtained for each field o by solving the following lp problem 5 n r t e o m i n Œª i Œ∏ o j j 1 j Œ∏ o j j subject to i 1 i Œª i x i j Œ∏ o j x o j 0 i 1 i Œª i z i m z o m 0 i 1 i Œª i y i k y o k 0 i 1 i Œª i 1 Œª i 0 0 Œ∏ o j 1 2 3 scale efficiency and determination of returns to scale using dea the radial and non radial dea models discussed thus far assume vrs as indicated earlier crs may be imposed by omitting the convexity constraint Œª i 1 in both eqs 3 and 5 imposing both crs and vrs allows for calculation of scale efficiency scale efficiency se is determined for each field o under rte and nrte respectively as follows 6 s e r t e o r t e c r s o r t e v r s o 7 s e n r t e o n r t e c r s o n r t e v r s o the value for senrteo serteo will be 1 values equal to one means the field is scale efficient while values less than one means the field is scale inefficient with the level of scale inefficiency equal to 1 senrteo 1 serteo scale inefficiency arises due to either increasing returns to scale irs or decreasing returns to scale drs the values derived from eqs 6 and 7 can indicate if the field is scale inefficient but they provide no indication as to whether scale inefficiency arises as a result of irs or drs increasing or decreasing returns to scale may be determined for the field by running the te models in eqs 3 and 5 and replacing Œª i 1 with Œª i 1 the result is te calculated under nonincreasing returns to scale under non radial technical efficiency nrtenirso and radial technical efficiency rtenirso if nrtenirso nrtevrso rtenirso rtevrso the field exhibits drs larger than optimal scale if nrtenirso nrtevrso rtenirso rtevrso the field exhibits irs sub optimal scale finally if nrtecrso ntrevrso rtecrso rtevrso the field exhibits crs coelli et al 2002 fernandez cornejo 1994 3 empirical studies of input use efficiency using dea numerous studies use dea to calculate and evaluate the efficiency of input usage the literature pertaining to input use efficiency analysis with dea may be partitioned into two general classifications 1 sub vector dea focusing on a single input and 2 non radial dea focusing on multiple inputs 3 1 sub vector dea of input use efficiency sub vector dea refers to radial efficiency measured for a sub vector of inputs rather than for the entire vector of inputs sub vector dea was introduced by f√§re et al 1994 as a means for handling situations where some inputs in the input vector are fixed or uncontrollable in the short run 2 2 radial technical efficiency measured in eq 4 of the present study may be considered as sub vector dea in that inputs are segregated into variable and fixed inputs and radial efficiency is measured for the sub vector of variable inputs only however the majority of studies using this methodology focuses on efficiency measurement for one input only holding all other inputs and outputs constant sub vector dea in these studies uses the following lp model specification 8 s v e o m i n Œª i Œ∏ o t Œ∏ o t subject to i 1 i Œª i x i j t x o j t 0 i 1 i Œª i x i t Œ∏ o t x o t 0 i 1 i Œª i y i k y o k 0 i 1 i Œª i 1 Œª i 0 where Œ∏o t is the sub vector efficiency sveo obtained for input t and dmu o and all other variables are as previously defined Œ∏o t in eq 9 can take on a value between 0 and 1 with overuse of the input measured as 1 Œ∏o t input use efficiency studies using sub vector dea are presented in table 1 water is a limited or finite agricultural resource for much of the world thus the majority of studies in table 1 focuses exclusively on water efficiency either irrigation water use efficie 3 3 water use efficiency in our analysis and in other dea studies differs from other measures often used in the literature whereas many studies use an absolute measure kg yield per m3 us dollars per m3 water use efficiency in this study is measured in relative terms or percentages the efficiency measure Œ∏j is between 0 and 1 with inefficiency defined as 1 Œ∏j ncy or groundwater use efficiency we refer the reader to pereir and marques 2017 for a more in depth survey of dea studies dealing with irrigation water efficiency most studies estimate both rte and sve for each dmu and seek to compare rte to sve using one or more types of statistical measures pearson correlations cumulative distributions paired sample t tests many studies also evaluate efficiency under both vrs and crs specifications studies that do not evaluate efficiency under both returns to scale specifications assume the vrs specification lilienfeld and asmild 2007 manjunatha et al 2011 njiraini and guthiga 2013 varghese et al 2013 and watto and mugera 2014 2015 zhengfei and lansink 2003 one study watto and mugera 2014 segregates dmus into those exhibiting constant returns to scale crs decreasing returns to scale drs and increasing returns to scale irs 3 2 non radial dea of input use efficiency unlike the sub vector dea efficiency studies mentioned above which shrinks only one input holding everything else constant input based non radial dea efficiency studies shrink all inputs contained in the input vector as much as possible until the frontier is reached input use efficiency studies using non radial dea are presented in table 2 studies using input based non radial dea are more varied in topic relative to the sub vector dea studies however most non radial dea studies like their sub vector counterparts evaluate rte also comparing rte scores to nrte scores and often demonstrating rte nrte as shown by f√§re and lovell 1978 most non radial dea studies evaluate efficiency under vrs with two studies fernandez cornejo 1994 piesse et al 2002 segregating dmus into those exhibiting crs drs and irs 4 data used in the dea analysis input use efficiency scores are calculated for arkansas rice production using data from fields enrolled in the university of arkansas rice research verification program rrvp the rrvp was established in 1983 by the university of arkansas system division of agriculture s cooperative extension service ces to verify the profitability of ces recommendations in fields with less than optimum yields or returns baker et al 2018 these fields often differ in management from a grower s other fields as the grower is being shown how to manage based on ces rice production recommendations the grower supplies field data sheets that include all equipment field operations and custom operations used on each field as well as the types and quantities of inputs used seed fertilizers pesticides etc this information is then used as input in the university of aransas interactive budget spreadsheets to calculate returns and expenses for each field from 1983 2017 the rrvp has been conducted on 461 commercial rice fields in 33 rice producing counties in arkansas baker et al 2018 different fields are enrolled into the program each year with few fields occurring in consecutive years of the program output and input data for the dea analysis were obtained from 142 rice fields enrolled in the rrvp for the period 2005 2017 and summary statistics for these data are presented in table 3 the period 2005 2017 was chosen because rice management practices and varieties have remained fairly steady over this time frame only fields with irrigation water usage measured by flow meters were included in the study output for the dea analysis is measured as the value of rice production rice yield x milling yield adjusted rice price x field size inputs for the dea analysis are partitioned into variable and fixed inputs variable inputs include irrigation water m3 nitrogen kg herbicides diesel l labor hours and other inputs the other inputs category includes costs for seed insecticide fungicide phosphorus potassium other soil amendments chicken litter zinc urease inhibitors and custom applications many inputs in the other inputs category are used on an as needed basis fixed inputs for the dea analysis include field size ha and fixed expenses fixed expenses comprise of capital recovery expenses for machinery and irrigation equipment all monetary variables rice production value herbicides other inputs and fixed expenses are adjusted to 2017 dollars using the producer price index 5 fractional regression regression analysis was conducted to determine the impacts of alternative rice varieties and irrigation management on input efficiencies the standard approach used by most efficiency studies is the censored two limit tobit model which places limits at zero and unity to model efficiency scores however use of the two limit tobit model is questionable in that the accumulation of observations at unity in dea studies is a consequence of how dea scores are defined rather than the result of censoring ramalho et al 2010 dea scores are fractional or proportional and not generated by a censoring data generating process mcdonald 2009 in addition the domain of the two limit tobit model differs from that of dea scores because efficiency scores of zero are typically not observed ramalho et al 2010 given that dea scores are fractional or proportional and are mapped onto the interval 0 1 hoff 2007 and mcdonald 2009 considered the use of papke and wooldridge s 1996 fractional regression model the fractional regression model requires the assumption of a functional form for y the efficiency score that imposes the desired constraints on the conditional mean of the dependent variable as follows 9 e y x g x Œ∏ where g is some nonlinear function satisfying 0 g 1 papke and woodridge 1996 suggest as possible specifications for g any cumulative distribution function such as those commonly used to model binary data the most widely used functions are the symmetric logit and probit functional forms g xŒ∏ e xŒ∏ 1 e xŒ∏ and g xŒ∏ œÜ xŒ∏ respectively however other asymmetric alternatives also exist such as the loglog and complementary loglog or cloglog functional forms g xŒ∏ e e x Œ∏ and g xŒ∏ 1 e e x Œ∏ respectively ramalho et al 2010 the explanatory variables used in the fractional regression analysis are listed in table 4 explanatory variables include the location in which the field was enrolled northeast arkansas central east arkansas southeast arkansas non eastern arkansas the variety type used on the field conventional medium grain clearfield hybrid clearfield hybrid the water source for the field groundwater surface water the irrigation method chosen for the field contour levee with no miri contour levee with miri straight levee with no miri straight levee with miri zero grade furrow irrigation and the energy source used to power the irrigation pump for the field diesel electric all explanatory variables are zero one dummy variables one if the field was located in northeast arkansas zero otherwise one if the field was planted to a conventional long grain rice variety zero otherwise etc location dummy variables are based on usda national agricultural statistical service nass statistical reporting districts 3 northeast arkansas 6 central east arkansas and 9 southeast arkansas over 97 percent of all rice acres are planted in these collective statistical reporting districts non eastern arkansas includes fields located in statistical reporting districts other than districts 3 6 or 9 rice producers have the choice of planting a range of rice variety types including conventional public varieties clearfield varieties hybrid varieties and clearfield hybrid combinations nalley et al 2009 conventional varieties include both long and medium grain variety types these variety types differ in the size and shape of the kernel with long grain rice having a longer more slender kernel than medium grain rice clearfield varieties are resistant to imidazolinone herbicides and allow for greater control of red rice without killing rice growing in the field hybrids provide greater disease resistance higher yields and use less nitrogen relative to conventional varieties clearfield hybrids combine the red rice control of clearfield lines with the higher yielding and disease resistant traits of hybrids as mentioned earlier groundwater is the primary source of irrigation water in arkansas kresse et al 2014 and 73 of rice production area in the state is supplied with groundwater via wells with the remaining 27 supplied by surface water sources such as on farm reservoirs streams and rivers hardke 2018 seventy six percent of the 142 fields in the study receive water from wells groundwater while 24 of the fields receive water from surface water sources table 4 rice producers in arkansas currently use a combination of both diesel and electric pumps to supply irrigation water for rice production many arkansas rice producers converted from diesel to electric pumps in the latter 2000s due to lower installation costs for electric pumps relative to diesel pumps and lower per unit pumping costs for electric pumps relative to diesel pumps forty six of the 142 fields in the study 32 use electric pumps while 96 fields 68 use diesel pumps to apply irrigation water to rice rice field topography varies across arkansas depending on the amount of precision land grading conducted on each field levees are generally spaced at 0 1 0 3 ft per 100 ft 0 2 grade so rice fields have very little topographical relief and are constructed and destructed annually contour levees are created by following the natural grade of unimproved land resulting in irregularly shaped levees with many different sizes contour levee fields account for over 48 of rice acres in arkansas hardke 2018 fifty out of 142 rice fields in the study have contour levees table 4 an estimated 38 of arkansas rice acres are precision leveled to some degree hardke 2018 with most fields graded to a 0 05 to 0 2 slope precision land grading involves reforming the grade of the land at great expense to create a field with constant cross slope and nearly constant downslope resulting in levees that are of equal size and square in nature sixty seven of the 142 fields in the analysis have straight or nearly straight levees table 4 some rice fields in arkansas are leveled to a zero slope and are referred to as zero grade rice fields zero grade rice accounts for approximately 14 of planted rice acres in arkansas hardke 2018 zero grade rice production eliminates the need to build levees each year and results in significantly less irrigation and fuel when compared with contour levee rice production twenty one of the 142 fields in the study are zero grade fields table 4 a small number of rice acres in arkansas approximately 3 5 are managed using furrow irrigation hardke 2018 furrow irrigated rice or row rice management refers to planting rice on raised beds water is applied in the furrows between beds to maintain adequate soil moisture four of the 142 rice fields in the study are furrow irrigated fields multiple inlet rice irrigation accompanies many contour and straight levee rice fields in arkansas multiple inlet rice irrigation miri uses poly pipe to distribute irrigation water to all paddies simultaneously this differs from conventional flood irrigation in which water is applied to the first paddy at the top of the field and then flows over spills to lower paddies until the entire field is flooded vories et al 2005 multiple inlet irrigation allows the field to be flooded much faster than conventional flood irrigation water savings can be achieved using miri over conventional flood irrigation because the field is flooded quicker and irrigation efficiency is increased through reduced pumping time during the season other possible benefits of miri include reduced irrigation labor and possible higher grain yields vories et al 2005 multiple inlet rice irrigation is used on approximately 33 of all rice area in arkansas hardke 2018 and is used on 42 of the 142 rice fields evaluated in this study 14 contour levee rice fields and 28 straight levee rice fields with miri table 4 6 results 6 1 overall field efficiency scores summary statistics of overall field efficiencies radial technical efficiency non radial technical efficiency are presented in table 5 the lindo what s best spreadsheet solver was used to conduct the dea linear programming analysis for each field in the study lindo systems 2018 radial and non radial technical efficiency scores are presented under both crs and vrs for comparison the mean radial technical efficiency scores under crs rtecrs and vrs rtevrs are 0 696 and 0 740 respectively in contrast the mean non radial technical efficiency scores under crs nrtecrs and vrs nrtevrs are 0 535 and 0 596 respectively these statistics demonstrate what is shown in f√§re and lovell 1978 namely that the radial measure of technical efficiency is greater than or equal to the corresponding non radial measure of technical efficiency in both instances fields enrolled in the rrvp are technically inefficient on average with average inefficiencies for the radial measure ranging from 0 304 crs to 0 260 vrs and average inefficiencies for the non radial measure ranging from 0 465 crs to 0 404 vrs scale efficiency summary statistics for both radial and non radial technical efficiency are also presented in table 5 the mean scale efficiency under radial technical efficiency serte is 0 943 and the mean scale efficiency under non radial technical efficiency senrte is 0 900 both measures indicate the rrvp fields are scale inefficient on average with average scale inefficiency ranging from 0 057 for the radial measure to 0 100 for the non radial measure most of the scale inefficiency for the rrvp fields is due to drs table 6 over 59 of the 142 fields exhibit drs for the radial measure while nearly 82 of the 142 fields exhibit drs under the non radial measure table 6 these statistics indicate most fields in the study are operating at larger than optimal field sizes the average field size for fields exhibiting crs optimum size is 17 4 ha 43 1 ac for both radial and non radial measures in contrast the average field size for fields exhibiting drs larger than optimum size is 25 5 ha 62 9 ac under the radial measure and 22 8 ha 56 4 ac under the non radial measure finally the average size of fields exhibiting irs smaller than optimum size is 15 1 ha 37 4 ac for the radial measure and 12 7 ha 31 5 ac for the non radial measure 6 2 field and input efficiency scores under variable returns to scale summary statistics of field and input efficiencies are presented in table 7 results are presented under vrs because the majority of fields in the study exhibit varying rather than constant returns to scale overall field efficiency nrtevrs in table 7 is calculated as the sum of each individual efficiency score for the field divided by the number of inputs the contribution of each input to overall field efficiency can be evaluated with inputs having higher lower input efficiencies contributing more less to overall field efficiency irrigation water is the third largest contributor to overall efficiency with an average efficiency of 0 627 other inputs and nitrogen contribute more to overall efficiency than irrigation water average efficiencies of 0 801 and 0 749 for other inputs and nitrogen respectively table 7 in contrast labor diesel and herbicides contribute less to overall efficiency than irrigation water average efficiencies of 0 411 0 454 and 0 536 for labor diesel and herbicides respectively table 7 all rice inputs in table 7 exhibit inefficiencies on average average irrigation water inefficiency across all 142 fields is 0 373 indicating irrigation water is over applied on average by 37 3 labor is the most inefficient input overused on average by 58 9 while other inputs is the least inefficient input overused on average by 19 9 6 3 distributions of efficiency scores distributions of field and input efficiency scores under vrs are reported by efficiency range in table 8 a field or a particular input exhibits efficiency if its efficiency score is equal to one only 22 of the 142 fields evaluated 15 5 are efficient in all inputs nrtevrs 1 thirty four fields 23 9 are efficient in irrigation water application 36 fields 25 4 are efficient in nitrogen application 49 fields 34 5 are efficient in other inputs application 25 fields 17 6 are efficient in herbicide application and 22 fields 15 5 are efficient in both diesel and labor usage the majority of fields in the study exhibit some level of input inefficiency input efficiency scores 1 for example 76 1 of fields are inefficient in irrigation water application 82 4 are inefficient in herbicide application and 84 5 of fields are inefficient in both diesel and labor usage sixty fields out of 148 42 3 have irrigation water efficiencies less than 0 5 indicating that a large portion of the fields are over applying irrigation water by over 50 however the incidence of input over application is much greater for other key rice inputs such as herbicides diesel and labor input efficiency scores for these key rice inputs are below 0 5 for the majority of fields evaluated in the study 59 8 of fields have herbicide efficiencies less than 0 5 72 6 of fields have diesel efficiencies less than 0 5 and 75 3 of fields have labor efficiencies less than 0 5 table 8 other inputs and nitrogen have the lowest numbers of fields with efficiency scores less than 0 5 21 1 of fields with other input efficiency scores less than 0 5 27 4 of fields with nitrogen efficiency scores less than 0 5 table 8 6 4 efficiency score correlations pairwise correlations of input efficiencies are presented in table 9 all input efficiencies are significant and positively correlated with one another and with overall field efficiency nrtevrs implying that increasing the efficiency of one input will also increase the efficiency of other inputs as well as the overall field efficiency however some inputs have larger numeric correlations with overall field efficiency than others diesel efficiency labor efficiency herbicide efficiency and irrigation water efficiency are more strongly correlated with overall field efficiency 0 941 0 933 0 901 and 0 831 respectively than are nitrogen efficiency and other inputs efficiency 0 558 and 0 774 respectively these results suggest greater potential for increasing overall field efficiency by increasing diesel labor herbicide and irrigation water efficiencies diesel efficiency and labor efficiency have the strongest numeric correlation with one another 0 985 both inputs are directly related to field operations and thus their efficiencies are highly correlated irrigation water efficiency has a stronger numeric correlation with diesel and labor efficiency than with the other remaining inputs these findings provide evidence that management practices increasing irrigation water efficiency also tend to increase diesel and labor efficiencies 6 5 results of the fractional regression analysis four functional forms were considered for each efficiency measure 1 logit 2 probit 3 loglog and 4 complementary loglog or cloglog ramalho et al 2010 list some general tests for detecting the correct specification of functional form of the conditional mean e y x these tests include the reset test where polynomials in the fitted xŒ∏ are included in g to detect general kinds of functional form misspecification goodness of function form tests goff i and goff ii tests based on generalized functional forms which encompass g and the p test proposed by davidson and mackinnon 1981 which is used to compare nonlinear regression models to one another this study employed all four tests to determine the appropriate functional form for each input efficiency all four models were estimated and tested using stata version 15 statacorp 2017 and stata modules for estimating and testing fractional regression models obtained from ramalho 2014 variables omitted from each model include central east arkansas conventional groundwater contour levees no miri and diesel the effects of these variables are captured in the intercept of each model specification tests for selecting among the four fractional regression models are presented in table 10 in nearly all instances the reset test and goff i and goff ii tests reveal the four models fit the data appropriately exceptions were the logit and loglog functional forms which were miss specified for overall field efficiency nrtevrs based on the goff i test and the goff ii test respectively and the loglog model which was miss specified for diesel efficiency based on both the reset and the goff ii tests table 10 the p test revealed the cloglog model was the preferred functional form for nrtevrs irrigation water efficiency and herbicide efficiency and indicated the logit probit and cloglog models were all superior to the loglog model specification for diesel efficiency the p tests did not indicate a superior model specification for nitrogen efficiency labor efficiency and other inputs efficiency and did not indicate a superior model specification between the logit probit and cloglog models for diesel efficiency two additional statistics the akaike information criterion aic and the bayesian information criterion bic were used to determine the functional form that seemed to have the best fit for these efficiency measures souza and gomes 2015 based on these tests the functional form that seemed to fit nitrogen efficiency best was the loglog and the functional form that seemed to fit diesel efficiency labor efficiency and other inputs efficiency best was the cloglog estimated coefficients for selected fractional regression models of each efficiency measure are presented in table 11 the cloglog model was chosen for all efficiency models except nitrogen efficiency the loglog model was chosen for nitrogen efficiency regional variables were insignificant in all but one instance non eastern arkansas was negative and significant for nitrogen efficiency indicating rice fields located outside of eastern arkansas were less efficient in nitrogen application than fields located within eastern arkansas the type of variety planted has a significant impact on most efficiency measures medium grain has a positive and significant impact on all efficiency scores except other inputs efficiency medium grain rice tends to be higher yielding and often receives a price premium relative to conventional long grain rice varieties in most production years hybrid and clearfield hybrid have a positive and significant impact on all efficiency scores except herbicide efficiency non significant and other inputs efficiency negative and significant hybrid type rice varieties tend to yield higher than conventional rice varieties on marginal fields hybrid and clearfield hybrid along with clearfield have significantly negative effects on other inputs efficiency because of the higher seed cost for these varieties relative to non clearfield non hybrid varieties the water source for the field surface water versus ground water has no significant impacts on efficiency scores however the type of irrigation pump used on the field diesel electric had a significant impact on most efficiency scores electric pumps significantly reduced all efficiency measures with the exception of nitrogen efficiency implying fields using electric pumps overuse nearly all rice production inputs relative to fields using diesel pumps the type of irrigation method used significantly impacted most efficiency scores adding miri to contour and straight levee fields significantly increases nrtevrs irrigation water efficiency diesel efficiency and labor efficiency straight levee fields without miri significantly increases nrtevrs diesel efficiency labor efficiency and other inputs efficiency zero grade fields significantly increase all efficiency scores furrow irrigation has a significant negative impact on herbicide efficiency but has no significant impact on any other efficiency measures 7 discussion and implications this study provides strong evidence of inefficiency of input application in arkansas rice production the study used dea analysis and non radial technical efficiency to measure the technical efficiency of irrigation water and other major production inputs used on 142 fields enrolled in the university of arkansas rrvp the study found these fields to be technically inefficient on average with average overall inefficiency measured at 40 4 some inputs are used more inefficiently than other inputs rice inputs identified as being used more inefficiently included herbicides diesel and labor herbicides were overused on average by 46 4 while diesel and labor were overused on average by 54 6 and 58 9 respectively irrigation water was overused on average by 37 3 across the 142 rrvp fields this value falls within the range of irrigation water overuse values found in other dea studies involving rice 17 0 in azad et al 2015 44 0 in varghese et al 2013 31 9 in veettlil et al 2011 20 4 and 22 1 for tube well owners and water buyers respectively in watto and mugera 2014 the amount of water over application in our study was significant in many instances over 42 of the rrvp fields over applied irrigation water by over 50 the results of this study highlight the need to improve input efficiencies particularly irrigation water efficiency in arkansas rice production groundwater used for agriculture is becoming more limiting in many parts of arkansas where rice is heavily grown and improving irrigation water efficiencies on a field level would help mitigate this problem increased irrigation water efficiency at the field level also has environmental implications improved irrigation water efficiency on rice fields results in less water return flow from fields which in turn reduces the potential for release of harmful chemicals and excess nutrients into rivers streams and estuarine systems the study evaluated the influence of various management practices on input efficiencies using fractional regression rice variety selection was found to strongly impact input and field efficiencies rice varieties exhibiting high grain yields medium grain rice hybrids and clearfield hybrids had significantly positive impacts on most efficiency measures medium grain rice had a significantly positive impact on all efficiency measures except other inputs efficiency however the applicability of planting medium grain rice in arkansas is limited by market demand few growers raise medium grain rice in arkansas with planted area typically fluctuating slightly above or below 87 937 ha 200 000 ac in any given year hybrid and clearfield hybrid rice varieties have a significantly positive impact on overall field efficiency irrigation water efficiency nitrogen efficiency diesel efficiency and labor efficiency hybrid type varieties have good disease resistance use less nitrogen and tend to work better on marginal fields relative to conventional long grain varieties nalley et al 2014 also found increased water efficiency with hybrid type varieties due to a shorter growing season and thus less time under a flood for these variety types relative to conventional varieties management practices aimed at improving water flow across fields strongly impacts input efficiencies and overall field efficiency fields with straight levees have a significantly positive impact on overall field efficiency diesel efficiency labor efficiency and other inputs efficiency laughlin and mehrle 1996 report straight levee fields tend to be more efficient in labor and machinery due to less levee construction and destruction relative to contour levee fields laughlin and mehrle 1996 they also found greater harvest efficiency with combines for straight levee fields due to greater ease of movement across fields and also a higher incidence of input application with ground equipment relative to aerial application on straight levee fields relative to contour levee fields thus allowing for more timely and effective input application fields leveled to a zero grade significantly increased all efficiency measures in our study land preparation expenses are much lower for zero grade fields relative to either contour or straight levee fields because zero grade fields contain no levees watkins et al 2007 the absence of levees on zero grade fields also increases the harvest efficiency of combines watkins et al 2007 henry et al 2016 also found significant water savings comparing zero grade fields to both contour and straight levee fields water savings occur because these fields can be quickly flooded up and the depth of the flood can be maintained consistently across the field the primary disadvantages of zero grade are the initial capital cost of precision grading a field to a zero slope watkins et al 2007 potentially lower rice yields on cut areas during the initial years after the land improvement watkins et al 2007 and poor drainage of zero grade fields relative to sloping fields henry et al 2016 poor drainage limits the ability to rotate rice with other crops like soybeans compelling most producers to grow continuous rice on zero grade fields henry et al 2016 because of its limitations the use of zero grade management is relatively low accounting for slightly over 14 of arkansas rice area in 2017 hardke 2018 furrow irrigation had a significant negative impact on herbicide efficiency in our study which is an expected result since furrow irrigated rice fields tend to have more weed pressures and require more herbicide inputs relative to flooded rice fields however all other efficiency measures were not significantly impacted by furrow irrigation in our study which was likely due to the small number of fields in our analysis using this system of management fields with miri have a significantly positive impact on overall field efficiency irrigation water efficiency diesel efficiency and labor efficiency in our study the positive impact of miri on input and field efficiencies may be due to increased grain yields and increased water savings with miri henry et al 2016 found significantly larger grain yields on fields utilizing miri relative to fields without miri the authors speculated miri may allow for more equal distribution of cold water and bicarbonate found in many arkansas wells distributing both across the field rather than concentrating both at the top of the field the authors also speculated the higher yields for fields using miri may be due to faster flooding up of rice fields thus reducing nitrogen volatilization and hastening herbicide activation we also found higher rice grain yields on fields with miri interestingly henry et al 2016 found no water savings associated with fields using miri these results differ from vories et al 2005 which found miri used 24 less irrigation water than conventionally flooding this discrepancy in findings is likely due to the way field comparisons are made in the two studies vories et al 2005 compared paired fields with and without miri that were in close proximity to one another utilized the same management practices and consisted of the same soil type henry et al 2016 does not make such comparisons rice fields with and without miri in henry et al 2016 are independent to one another vary in management and are not in close proximity to one another thus henry et al 2016 concludes there may be more potential water savings with miri than is indicated in their study over one third of rice area in arkansas utilized miri in 2017 hardke 2018 indicating potential for expanded use of miri in arkansas rice production the water source for the field surface water versus ground water has no significant impacts on any efficiency measure henry et al 2016 found fields supplied with surface water used significantly less irrigation water relative to fields supplied with groundwater in our study surface water had a positive impact on most efficiency measures including irrigation water efficiency but in no instance was the impact of surface water found to be significant the use of electric pumps relative to diesel pumps was found to have a significant negative effect on all efficiency measures except nitrogen efficiency this result is due largely to relative differences in field topographies using the two pump types in our study forty six percent of fields with electric pumps had contour levees compared with 31 of fields with diesel pumps in contrast 52 of fields using diesel pumps were straight levee fields compared with 37 of fields using electric pumps moreover a larger proportion of straight levee fields with diesel pumps also utilized miri 47 relative to straight levee fields with electric pumps 24 utilized miri finally we found a lower proportion of electric pump fields having zero grade relative to diesel pump fields fifty seven percent of the zero grade fields in our study used diesel pumps compared with 38 using electric pumps 8 conclusions groundwater from the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer is an essential resource for the sustainability of agricultural production in arkansas but this valuable resource is being withdrawn more rapidly than the aquifer can be recharged in many parts of the state rice accounts for a significant portion of groundwater withdrawn from the aquifer this study evaluates irrigation water efficiency in rice production along with the efficiency of other key rice production inputs using data from 142 rice fields enrolled in the university of arkansas rice research verification program rrvp this study differs from most other studies focusing specifically on irrigation water efficiency in that efficiencies of other related rice inputs are also evaluated the findings reveal irrigation water was overused on average by 37 3 across the 142 fields and many fields in the study over applied irrigation water in excess of 50 clearly there is a need to improve the efficiency of irrigation water application in arkansas rice production based on our results this study provides evidence that rice variety choice can influence irrigation water efficiency medium grain rice and hybrid type rice varieties improved irrigation water efficiency relative to conventional long grain varieties we also found hybrid type and medium grain varieties increased nitrogen efficiency diesel efficiency and labor efficiency relative to conventional long grain varieties medium grain and hybrid type varieties tend to be higher yielding than conventional long grain varieties particularly on marginal fields fields enrolled in the rrvp tend to be marginal in nature and tend to have less than optimum yields and returns arkansas rice producers have adopted several management practices to improve irrigation water efficiency in rice production these include construction of tail water pits and on farm reservoirs precision land grading to improve the flow of water across fields straight levees and zero grade management and multiple inlet rice irrigation miri which uses poly pipe to distribute irrigation water to all rice paddies simultaneously an important finding of this study is that adoption of many of these irrigation management practices improves the application efficiency of other key rice production inputs in addition to irrigation water such as diesel and labor thus management practices aimed at improving irrigation water efficiency also improve efficiency of other key rice production inputs leading to improved profit margins for rice producers this latter point is significant because rice is a high cost crop relative to other field crops grown in arkansas and is very susceptible to narrowing profit margins arising from low rice prices combined with high input costs declaration of competing interest the authors reported no declarations of interest acknowledgements the authors gratefully

10333,determining how to optimize a scientific and efficient farmland nitrogen n fertilizer schedule by combining existing technology is currently a hot topic maize is one of the major crops in china and enhancing the yield of maize is conducive to ensuring china s food security in this study the central region of jilin province was adopted as the research object and a three year 2014 2016 field experiment was performed the data from 2014 were used to calibrate the dssat model and the data from 2015 were used for validation after calibration and validation the dssat model and a genetic algorithm ga were used to optimize the n fertilizer schedule of maize under 20 years 1973 1992 of meteorological data for changchun the experimental data from 2016 were used to validate the results of the optimized n fertilizer schedule as revealed from the results the dssat model effectively simulated the growth and development of maize under drip irrigation and rain fed methods in changchun the model was first calibrated based on the crop yield phenological phases and soil moisture and n content data and good agreement was achieved between the simulated and measured data in both the calibration and validation periods in the calibration and validation periods the normalized root mean square error nrmse for grain yield was 1 45 and 1 61 respectively the total amount in the new n fertilizer schedule is 198 kg ha which is slightly higher than that in the traditional schedule 187 5 kg ha and the yield of maize in the proposed n fertilizer schedule was upregulated by 7 9 compared with the conventional n fertilization schedule in the experimental results for 2016 through an analysis of economic benefits drip irrigation is better than the rain fed method and the optimized n fertilization schedule will make the economic benefits more significant 8 4 12 4 increase additionally this method is easier to combine with remote sensing and weather forecasting forming a real time method of field management optimization schedule decision making keywords maize drip irrigation dssat ga nitrogen fertilizer schedule 1 introduction maize is one of the most popular grain crops in northeast china and increasing maize production is becoming increasingly important in future work wu et al 2019 drip irrigation is one of the most frequently employed measures to save water and boost production and it has been used in maize cultivation in northeast china sui et al 2018 as one of the three golden maize belts jilin china ukraine same latitude america worldwide jilin province is one of the critical grain production regions in china and the yield of maize directly affects chinese food security and crop trade wang et al 2017 in the past irrigation of maize in jilin province generally was in the form of furrow irrigation or rain fed methods as the water saving and grain increasing action project was implemented in four provinces in northeast china by the chinese government over the past few years the form of irrigation of maize in jilin gradually transformed to drip irrigation under film mulch this form of irrigation was verified to boost the maize yield to nearly 16 000 kg hm2 wang et al 2018 applying fertilizer to a field with water is a significantly effective field management model liang et al 2013 drip irrigation combined with the application of nitrogen n fertilizer dissolved in irrigation water usually termed fertigation nourishes crops more precisely than broadcast fertilization and has been verified as an efficient irrigation method to save water and reduce the use of n fertilizer singandhupe et al 2003 tian et al 2017 field experiments were performed to determine the optimal irrigation scheduling and the proper period to inject fertilizers via drip irrigation water in sandy soil to optimize maize yield and water productivity as revealed from the results increasing the amount of irrigation water and the fertilizer application period can facilitate vegetative growth and yield ibrahim et al 2016 based on experimental findings it is possible to control no3 leaching out of the root zone in the growing season with a proper combination of irrigation and fertilizer management gheysari et al 2009 2015 azad et al 2020 conventional maize drip irrigation research tends to use field experiments but field experiments are time consuming and laborious and the number of experimental groups is commonly insufficient subsequently a growing number of researchers have begun to use crop models to simulate the growth of maize jiang et al 2019 dokoohaki et al 2016 babel et al 2019 azad et al 2018 2019 specifically dssat is a comprehensive model for plant simulation and it has been successfully used in many crop simulations worldwide e g irrigation management the effect of climate change on plants and the effect of n on yield jiang et al 2016 bhatia et al 2008 moreover dssat has been extensively employed in maize growth simulations on the whole the dssat ceres maize model performed exceedingly well for the northern transitional zone of karnataka and this model can act as a decision support system tool in agriculture and can be used to study the impacts of climate change on maize crops belay and patil 2017 yakoub et al 2017 proved that a better n fertilizer schedule was obtained by the dssat model corbeels et al 2016 assessed the capability of dssat in simulating crop responses to mulching and investigated the sensitivity of the dssat model output to input parameters paying special attention to the determinants of the model response to the practice of conservation agriculture dssat has been successfully used in drip irrigation simulations for maize l√≥pez cedr√≥n et al 2008 ma et al 2012 fu et al 2020 fang et al 2017 as well as in drip irrigation research on wheat and cotton dar et al 2017 li et al 2019 with the rise of crop models modern optimization algorithms can be used to solve the optimal management system of maize this refers to a nonlinear problem to optimize the fertilization schedule of maize under drip irrigation a genetic algorithm ga is considered a prominent optimization algorithm applied to this type of problem moreover a combination with other model cases can provide the best solution for model simulation ferreiro et al 2016 suhaimi et al 2018 used a ga to solve the optimization problem of agricultural wastewater treatment luo et al 2016 employed a ga to calculate the agricultural and sideline product logistics distribution path planning problem and effective results were achieved allam et al 2016 adopted a ga in a simulation based optimization framework for reuse of agricultural drainage water in irrigation the study of fertilizer schedules of maize drip irrigation is primarily determined by field experiments however the pertinence is relatively strong and the universality is poor crop varieties soil conditions and climate factors in different regions will cause errors in field experimental data as a comprehensive test method is very time consuming and requires a large amount of calculation traditional research on n fertilizer optimization based on dssat is also generally based on orthogonal tests or several established n fertilizer schedules fu et al 2020 which may lead to a local optimal solution therefore the effective combination of a ga and the dssat model can perfectly solve this problem the ga only needs to give the range of the fertilization amount in each stage and can solve the problem with a larger search range and higher efficiency to delve into the optimal n fertilizer schedule under the full drip irrigation mode in northeast china and to make the simulation method easier to promote a three year 2014 2016 field experiment was performed in this study to calibrate data from 2014 and validate data from 2015 the dssat model moreover the optimized fertilization schedule was solved by combining the dssat model with a ga according to the weather data from 1973 to 1992 in changchun then data from 2016 were used to validate the optimized n fertilizer schedule the present study primarily aims to 1 explore the optimal n fertilization schedule in the central part of jilin province 2 validate the feasibility of the method combining dssat with a ga and obtain a theoretical reference for its promotion and 3 investigate the application of optimization algorithms remote sensing climate prediction and crop models in future agricultural real time optimization management systems 2 materials

irrigation schedule was determined from the upper and lower limits of soil water content by eq 1 and the full crop water requirements were considered in the study the amount of irrigation was always 20 mm and the irrigation schedule is shown in table 3 1 q i a h Œ∏ up Œ∏ low p Œº where Œ∏ up and Œ∏ low denote the upper and lower limits of soil water content and were taken to be 100 and 75 of the

187 5 kg ha is determined according to local conditions combined with the exchange of experts in the lvyuan local agricultural extension station the optimized n fertilization schedule n2 198 kg ha is achieved by dssat and a ga from 20 year meteorological data in section 3 3 the two n fertilization schedules are shown in table 4 one day before the time of sowing 150 kg p2o5 ha 1 as calcium superphosphate and 120 kg k2o ha 1 as potassium sulfate were applied in the field the aim of these three years of experiments is as follows the first two years are adopted to calibrate 2014 and validate 2015 the dssat parameters subsequently the dssat model and ga are integrated to determine the optimized n fertilizer schedule with 20 year 1973 1992 weather data the data from 2016 are exploited to validate the optimized n fertilizer schedule 2 2 measurement methods of parameters 2 2 1 soil moisture and fertility soil was collected by an auger and then transferred to the laboratory for subsequent measurement the available n was measured with a k1160 kjeldahl nitrogen analyzer from shandong manon scientific instrument co ltd the available potassium organic matter and available phosphorus were determined by a zyd tf soil nutrient quick tester from beijing zhiyunda technology co ltd with tzs 1k soil moisture probes from nanjing tuopu technology co ltd the soil water content swc was measured each day 2 2 2 plant measurements the measured plant factors consisted of plant height stem diameter leaf area index lai n quality and dry matter quality at each growth phase a meter exhibiting a precision of 1 mm was used to measure the plant height and a vernier caliper with a precision of 1 mm was used to measure the stem diameter dry matter was measured with a drying method by drying at 105 c for 1 h and then at 75 c for 72 h after which the dry matter was weighed and ground to 0 5 mm then the plant powder was measured by a kjeldahl nitrogen analyzer for n quality the leaf area was measured with a ymj a from zhejiang tuopuyun agricultural technology co ltd and the lai can be calculated by 2 lai 1 n l si i a where n l is the number of plants per plot si is the total leaf area per plant si i denotes the sum of the leaf area per plot and a is the area covered per plot 2 2 3 measurements of meteorological factors the meteorological data from 2014 to 2016 collected in this experiment are elucidated as solar radiation air temperature wind speed evaporation and rainfall in the vicinity of the test area a watchdog meteorological automatic recorder was installed to automatically collect the mentioned meteorological information every 5 min and automatic recording was achieved all the mentioned data for the period of 1973 1992 were harvested from the changchun meteorological station 43 88 n 125 26 e located in lvyuan district 2 2 4 plant growth and yield measurements the yield measurement area was taken as 1 3 15 m for the plots for drip irrigation furrow irrigation and the rain fed method the grain yields were measured with 12 water content other factors were measured with the following methods ear number all the production ears in the yield

were taken to measure the ear diameter with a vernier caliper exhibiting a precision of 1 mm 100 grain weight the weight of 100 maize grains was measured five times in each plot and then the average value was taken 2 2 5 n use efficiency the n use efficiency nue kg kg is calculated as the kg yield for each kg n applied as fertilizer sui et al 2018 and is written as 3 nue g y n n rate where g y n denotes the grain yield under the application of n fertilizer and n rate represents the amount of n fertilizer 2 3 model and data analyses 2 3 1 dssat model 2 3 1 1 input model data the main input data in dssat include soil data climate data crop cultivar coefficients and management data soil data the soil information is the physical and chemical characteristics including soil texture percentages of sand silt and clay bulk density soil n soil organic carbon and water capacity for each soil layer table 1 weather data since the maize model in dssat is simulated every day a daily format is also needed for meteorological data the minimum meteorological input of the model is the daily rainfall solar radiation and the maximum and minimum temperatures all of which are obtained by the field weather station section 2 2 3 management data the management data include the irrigation schedule planting method fertilizer schedule planting date harvest date and so on section 2 1 crop cultivar coefficients crop cultivar coefficients are required to simulate crop growth rates and stages biomass production and grain yield liu et al 2013 the genetic coefficients of each crop cultivar were manually adjusted to reach an accurate goodness of fit between the simulated and measured datasets a new cultivar was built for the calibration of maize in dssat namely zidantou 1 there are six cultivar coefficients for maize in dssat which are p1 degree days base 8 c from emergence to the end of the juvenile phase p2 photoperiod sensitivity coefficient 0 1 0 p5 degree days base 8 c from silking to physiological maturity g2 potential kernel number g3 potential kernel growth rate mg kernel d and phint degree days required for a leaf tip to emerge phyllochron interval c d 2 3 1 2 methodology the methodology of the maize model in dssat is as follows the dynamic changes in soil moisture and nonstandard crop yield can be simulated by simulating the distribution function of soil nonstandard biomass and n all of these simulations are performed daily at the end of each day plant growth soil moisture and carbon and n balances are updated biomass formation is directly driven by solar radiation and affected by the external environment biomass allocation was different in different growth stages 2 3 1 3 output data the yield of maize growth period and variations in swc and soil n content were the output data and were used to calibrate and validate the model 2 3 2 ga model 2 3 2 1 input model data the ga needs initial input data including the initial population genetic algebra fitness selection method crossover method and mutation method initial population in this study the population number is 10 and the genetic algebra reaches 1000 the string length of each n fertilization factor encoded by binary code is 6 and each population individual covers 5 fertilization factors so the long tail of the population individual string is expressed as 5 6 30 the range of each n amount in different periods is shown in table 5 fitness function the fitness function of the ga is critical to the solution and the fitness function is determined based on the annual yield income and the input amount of n fertilizer the main independent variable refers to the amount of fertilizer and the dependent variable is the yield the fitness equation is written as 4 f x 1 n y r n r n where y r denotes the profit from the yield n r is the cost of the amount of n fertilizer the price of n fertilizer is 4 yuan kg and the price of maize is 3 yuan kg selection method selection is used to determine the number of individuals after crossover mutation by evaluating the fitness of individuals and this method has a great impact on the efficiency and convergence of the ga this paper uses roulette selection which is a playback random sampling method all the choices are to select good individuals from the current population according to the fitness values of the individuals and some criteria to enter the next generation population the probability of each individual entering the next generation is equal to the ratio of its fitness value to the sum of individual fitness values in the whole population the higher the fitness value is the greater the possibility of being selected and the greater the probability of entering the next generation crossover method crossover is a step in which two homologous chromosomes generate a new generation of chromosomes through mating and recombination and two individuals are selected from the population according to the probability of exchanging a group of genes the newly generated individuals inherit the basic characteristics of their parents and push the population to the optimal solution in this paper single point crossover is used which means that only one crossover point is randomly set in the coding string of individuals and then some chromosomes of two paired individuals are exchanged with each other at this point the crossover probability is 0 9 in this paper mutation method mutation is used to change a gene of an individual with a small probability and then generate a new individual this method determines the local search ability of the ga the crossover operator and mutation operator cooperate with each other to complete the mutual supplement of global and local search of the algorithm which provides support for the optimization process in this paper we use gene mutation which refers to an individual coding string above the mutation probability and the value of a certain or several randomly assigned loci is used for the mutation operation the mutation coefficient is 0 1 in this paper 2 3 2 2 methodology a ga is a kind of randomized search method that is based on the principle of evolution in the biological world survival of the fittest its main characteristics are that it can operate directly on structural objects without the limitation of derivation and function continuity and it has inherent implicit parallelism and good global optimization ability using a probabilistic optimization method the optimization space can be obtained and guided automatically and the search direction can be adjusted adaptively without definite rules these properties of gas have been widely used in combinatorial optimization machine learning signal processing adaptive control and artificial life it is a key technology in modern intelligent computing 2 3 2 3 output data when the simulation steps are input to the genetic algebra the optimized n fertilizer schedule simulation results are output 2 3 3 combining the ga with dssat the steps of the combined dssat and ga are illustrated in fig 3 the first generation population generated by the ga is substituted into dssat to obtain the results the optimal selection is made from the results after crossover and mutation operations the population is replaced in dssat until the target genetic algebra is reached finally the calculation is stopped and the optimized n fertilizer schedule is output 2 3 4 data analysis the yield component data were analyzed by variance tests in spss 14 0 in all cases differences are considered to exhibit statistical significance if p 0 05 to verify whether the model results perform well the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae average root mean square error nrmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse are adopted error analysis is conducted to determine the differences between the assessed and measured data the rmse mae nmsre and nse are calculated as follows 5 mae 1 n 1 n x i y i 6 rmse 1 n x i y i 2 n 7 nrmse rmse y 100 8 nse 1 1 n y i x i 2 1 n y i y 2 where n denotes the number of lateral measuring points and x and y represent the calculated and measured values respectively 3 results 3 1 analysis of maize parameters 3 1 1 lai the lai of maize is one of the major parameters used to assess the growth and development of maize this value has an effect on the photosynthesis respiration and transpiration of maize with an increase in the lai the metabolic capacity of maize is enhanced duan et al 2014 the lai of all treatments in 2014 and 2015 varied with the growth cycle fig 4 in the ve and vt periods the growth rate of the lai was the maximum and then it gradually decreased it peaked at r2 and then decreased again due to dehydration and shrinkage of the leaves these results suggest that the lai of the drip irrigation group is significantly higher than that of the rain fed group demonstrating that drip irrigation can effectively elevate the lai of the maize residual cycle in accordance with previous research results liu et al 2017 3 1 2 plant height the plant height of maize can effectively indicate the growth and development of maize gao et al 2013 and the plant height of maize varies with the growth period fig 5 in the ve vj and vt periods the growth rate of the plant height is the maximum and then it tends to decrease the plant height decreases due to the fragile fracture of stamens after dehydration in the r6 period in addition drip irrigation can effectively increase the plant height of maize compared with that of the rain fed group the average increases by 18 7 in the r2 stage the variation trend is consistent with existing research results kang et al 2010 3 1 3 production factors of maize in all the treatments the 100 grain weight ranged from 28 45 to 31 45 g table 6 and irrigation significantly impacted the 100 grain weight of maize the 100 grain weight of maize under drip irrigation was 9 higher than that under the rain fed method the ear diameter ranged from 4 0 to 4 2 cm in all the treatments table 6 different irrigation methods slightly impact maize diameter the ear length ranged from 18 83 to 24 27 cm in all the treatments table 6 and irrigation noticeably impacted the ear length of maize the ear length of the drip irrigation group was 20 4 higher than that of the rain fed group the number of grains per ear ranged from 551 to 623 in all the treatments table 6 compared with the rain fed group the drip irrigation group increased the number of grains per ear by 10 8 moreover the ear number ranged from 58 715 to 65 961 in all the treatments table 6 and this factor was 6 smaller in the data from 2014 than in the data from 2015 for an identical irrigation method the yield in 2015 was less than that in 2014 probably due to the hail that occurred on may 30 2015 hail kills some maize seedlings and the mean ear number in 2015 was 6 less than that in 2014 3 2 model calibration and validation the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue coefficient estimator combined with a trial and error method is employed to assess the genetic parameters jiang et al 2019 in this study the mentioned parameters of maize are calibrated based on data from 2014 and the results are validated with data from 2015 the six parameters of zidantou 1 maize are listed in table 7 the differences between the measured and simulated data are listed in table 8 e g harvest yield emergence anthesis and grain filling dates it is therefore demonstrated that the simulated values agree well with the measured values compared with the rain fed method drip irrigation slightly shortened the growth period of maize table 8 and the yield of maize under drip irrigation was 28 7 and 26 2 higher than that under the rain fed method in 2014 and 2015 respectively the nrmse values of the yield in 2014 calibration and 2015 validation are 1 45 and 1 61 respectively the mae values for the growth periods in 2014 calibration and 2015 validation are 1 1 5 and 0 3 respectively and these values prove that the model provides a good simulation result the model performance statistics rmse nrmse mae and nse for swc and soil no3 n content at different depths for the calibration 2014 and validation 2015 datasets are summarized in table 9 for the calibration and validation datasets the rmse nrmse mae and nse values for swc ranged from 0 0186 to 0 0292 cm3 cm3 10 83 17 57 0 0153 0 024 cm3 cm3 and 0 82 0 923 respectively indicating good agreement between the simulated and measured water contents the simulation accuracy for soil no3 n content was also found to be acceptable with rmse values of 0 3957 4 8658 mg kg nrmse values of 14 13 31 08 mae values of 0 3076 3 5454 mg kg and nse values of 0 7881 0 956 which indicated a good performance of the model fig 6 compares the simulated and measured swc and soil no3 n content at various depths during the 2014 season calibration data to illustrate the capability of the model for capturing the temporal and spatial trends of swc and soil no3 n content the simulated and measured swc increased greatly following an irrigation or precipitation event and then decreased gradually due to drainage and evapotranspiration in changchun the rainfall was sufficient in the early stage the swc was generally high and the rainfall decreased in the later stage fig 1 irrigation was started with the increase in crop water consumption and the swc changed with irrigation the surface soil had a strong response to rainfall and irrigation the swc of the surface soil increased greatly after rainfall and irrigation the soil no3 n content changed significantly with the fertilization time and the deeper the soil was the smaller the change which corresponded to the lower soil no3 n content in deep soil table 1 these results suggest that dssat can simulate the changes in swc and soil no3 n content 3 3 model application 3 3 1 analysis of 20 year operation simulation data from running the dssat and ga model the simulated changes in maize yield under 20 years 1973 1992 of meteorological data are presented in fig 7 and the precipitation in changchun ranges from 500 mm to 700 mm the irrigation methods are divided into the rain fed method and drip irrigation and the drip irrigation schedule is based on eq 1 the n fertilizer schedules are divided into n1 and n2 according to table 4 the maize variety is the same as zidantou 1 and the soil data are the same as those presented in table 1 the ridge spacing is 65 cm and the plant density is 62 500 plants ha according to the experimental experience the sowing date is set to may 1 and the harvest date is set to october 1 the simulation results are listed in table 10 in which individual 8 is not consistent with the other individuals as the mutation probability is set to 0 1 most of the population is the same demonstrating that the genetic results are converged the yield of maize with drip irrigation and the n2 n fertilizer schedule is higher than that with n1 whereas the result is the opposite for the rain fed group table 11 3 3 2 validation of optimization results the results of the field experiments performed in 2016 were used to validate the optimized n fertilizer schedule the simulation results are listed in table 12 the rmse nrmse mae and nse values for the yield reach 173 kg ha 1 56 156 5 kg ha and 0 985 respectively demonstrating that the dssat model achieves good simulation results the yield of maize with the n2 fertilizer schedule increases by 7 and 9 with the rain fed and drip irrigation methods respectively compared to that with n1 the nue values for drip irrigation are 26 2 and 28 8 higher than those for the rain fed treatment in n1 and n2 respectively and the rmse nrmse mae and nse values for nue reach 0 92 kg kg 1 6 0 824 kg kg and 0 983 respectively 3 4 economic analysis the costs of land use and insecticide are basically the same in each treatment table 13 because the drip irrigation group has to lay the drip pipeline manually the cost of labor and machinery operating cost will be much higher than those for the rain fed group compared with the rain fed group the drip irrigation group also has to pay for electricity and water the drip irrigation system costs more in the first year and the benefits of the drip irrigation group are lower than those of the rain fed group however from the second year on the main project of drip irrigation does not need to be reinvested and only part of it needs to be repaired and replaced thus the cost is greatly reduced the benefits of the drip irrigation group are much higher than those of the rain fed group in 2015 and 2016 table 12 comparing the n1 and n2 treatment groups the n2 treatment can effectively improve the economic benefits for both the rain fed group 8 4 increase and the drip irrigation group 12 4 increase 4 discussion 4 1 the main results of this research 4 1 1 the yield and nue the yield of maize under drip irrigation was 28 7 26 2 and 28 9 higher than that under rain fed treatment in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively it is therefore verified that drip irrigation can effectively boost the yield of maize in northeast china and this finding is consistent with previous studies wang et al 2018 wu et al 2019 guo et al 2017 liu et al 2017 table 8 suggests that the yield of maize in 2015 was significantly lower than that in 2014 which may have been caused by the hail that occurred on may 30 2015 hail kills some maize seedlings and the mean ear number in 2015 was 6 less than that in 2014 table 5 the maximum yield in this paper was 12 951 kg ha in 2016 table 12 which is slightly lower than that found in previous studies in northeast china sui et al 2018 reported a maximum yield of 14 585 kg ha with a plant density of 61 438 plants ha under drip irrigation with film mulching in heilongjiang province china the plant density in their study is similar to ours and the difference in yield may be caused by film mulching as many studies have proven that film mulching can increase the yield du et al 2008 ning et al 2015 yang et al 2017 this paper considered the high cost of digestion film mulching and nondigestion film mulching will contaminate the environment fan et al 2012 2017 hou et al 2010 so no film mulching technology was used wu et al 2019 found a maximum yield of 15 688 kg ha with a planting density of 70 000 plants ha through two years of field experiments with drip irrigation and film mulching in jilin china the plant density in their study is much higher than ours and may be the major reason that their yield is much higher zidantou 1 is not a close planting maize variety the planting density is based on the local average planting level and lodging prevention is set in future work close planting of maize will be tried however the problem that overplanting may lead to serious degradation of soil fertility will also be investigated the nue of drip irrigation is higher than that of the rain fed method table 12 as drip irrigation is more beneficial to the utilization of n fertilizer it can also more effectively play the role of n fertilizer zou et al 2020 a significant interaction is identified between water and fertilizer zheng et al 2020 the optimized fertilization schedule can enhance the nue table 12 as proven previously wortmann et al 2011 wang et al 2018 moreover the nue for the rain fed method is significantly lower than that for drip irrigation drip irrigation will enhance the nue more than conventional irrigation ju et al 2009 wang et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 the optimized fertilization system is capable of slightly improving the nue and a reasonable fertilization schedule can help enhance fertilizer utilization efficiency zhang et al 2016 the nue of drip irrigation ranges from 50 kg kg to 65 3 kg kg table 12 which is consistent with previous studies sui et al 2018 wang et al 2018 sui et al 2018 reported nue values from 36 24 kg kg to 73 43 kg kg with drip irrigation and wang et al 2018 reported nue values from 42 7 kg kg to 80 3 kg kg with drip irrigation our values fall in the middle and upper parts of these ranges because of the principle of diminishing benefits the more fertilizer that is applied the lower the utilization rate of fertilizer the less fertilizer there is the higher the fertilizer utilization rate but the lower the yield wang et al 2018 recommended an n amount of 240 kg ha and the benefit was the highest at an nue value of 67 1 kg kg sui et al 2018 recommended an n amount of 230 kg ha and the benefit was the highest at an nue value of 61 4 kg kg in this paper we recommend an nue value of 65 3 kg kg for a n amount of 198 kg ha which is between those values provided and indicates that our results are reliable 4 1 2 model application and economic considerations the dssat model has been successfully used in the simulation of maize with drip irrigation in previous studies l√≥pez cedr√≥n et al 2008 ma et al 2012 fu et al 2020 fang et al 2017 however the model needs to be calibrated and validated before use amouzou et al 2018 in this paper the error analysis of the yield and growth period between the simulated and measured data is in line with the requirements and is also relatively consistent with previous studies jiang et al 2016 in addition to these calibrations swc and soil n content also need to be further considered the rmse value of swc in 2014 and 2015 ranged from 0 0186 to 0 0292 cm3 cm3 which is similar to that in kandelous and simunek 2010 who reported values of 0 01 0 05 cm3 cm3 the rmse of soil no3 n content ranged from 0 3957 to 4 8658 mg kg the simulation accuracy for soil no3 n content was also found to be acceptable as doltra and mu√±oz 2010 reported rmse values of 1 9 6 7 mg kg this proved that dssat can be successfully used in the simulations in this paper the simulation of the optimized n fertilizer system is also very successful as shown through the validation of the data from 2016 table 12 and the model can better predict the optimized n fertilizer schedule with acceptable error analysis jiang et al 2016 through benefit analysis we found that in the first year we need to make a large investment in drip irrigation equipment and the planting income is not as high as that of ordinary planting however from the second year with costs only from partial maintenance and replacement of drip irrigation equipment the economic benefits gradually increase table 14 these results prove that drip irrigation is feasible in northeast china and this finding is consistent with previous research sui et al 2018 wang et al 2018 wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 drip irrigation not only increased the yield of maize but also improved the water and fertilizer use efficiencies providing a solid foundation for food security wang et al 2018 the n2 treatment increased the nue of n fertilizer by 5 6 the yield by 9 table 13 and the economic benefit by 12 4 compared to the n1 treatment table 14 therefore the optimized n fertilizer schedule n2 recommended in this paper is completely feasible 4 2 the limitations of this study and future work 4 2 1 the limitations of this study in this study based on full irrigation the optimal schedule of n fertilizer was considered in fact past research has also shown a significant effect between water and fertilizer irmak et al 2016 limited irrigation may also improve the water and n use efficiencies sui et al 2018 in future research we will need to combine irrigation systems to give a reasonable field management system on the other hand this paper uses a crop model and optimization algorithm to give the optimal n schedule and this approach has universality however the validation of this method is carried out only in northeast china and the method needs to be verified in more places in the future 4 2 2 future work in recent years field experiments combined with crop model simulations have been used to determine management schedules since crop models can dynamically quantify crop growth responses to farmland environments however most studies on optimizing management strategies using crop models have focused on management scheduling options based on limited experimental data and simulations with long term weather data anothai et al 2013 he et al 2013 lopez et al 2017 however there are still many problems to be overcome in order to apply this approach to real time simulation 1 determining how to use crop simulation models for irrigation scheduling based on real time weather conditions 2 determining how to calibrate crop models in real time and 3 determining how to optimize management schedules in real time for weather problems some researchers have used historical weather data and real time weather data to generate multiple complete climate data series covering the whole growing season to predict crop growth and yield bannayan and hoogenboom 2008 lawless and semenov 2005 in this way weather series can be generated on each day of the growing season by combining local history with newly measured daily weather data therefore it is possible to predict the growth of maize and the grain yield related to actual weather conditions on each day before harvest chen et al 2017 chen et al 2020 provided a new tool for dynamic irrigation schedules in the maize production season in northwest china by this method the real time simulation effect of the model may not perform as well for sudden changes in climate and other factors so we need to use some means to calibrate the model simulation data remote sensing and crop models are becoming important tools that help in water and n balances and yield forecasting guo et al 2018 leroux et al 2019 the real time and macro characteristics of remote sensing rs data complement the continuity and mechanisms of crop growth models these data can facilitate the application of crop models at spatial scales help to monitor crop growth and provide large scale crop yield estimates jin et al 2018 the lai is commonly used as validation data in crop models and hosseini et al 2015 jin et al 2017 and ahmad et al 2018 planned verification of the lai to forecast crop yield by using both remote sensing and crop modeling there are certain solutions to the above two problems but traditional management system optimization is based on a fixed experimental schedule when the climate changes suddenly a traditional management scheme is no longer effective determining how to fully consider the climate model accuracy and coupling of water and fertilizer is the key to giving a reasonable management schedule in real time a ga can provide a basis for the scope of irrigation and amount of fertilizer to optimize the best management system schedule which can be predicted for input into a real time model the combination of a ga and crop model can provide such a schedule as shown in fig 8 in future research we can make full use of existing climate prediction models and remote sensing correction methods to continuously correct the model in real time and achieve immediate optimization of a field management system 5 conclusions through a combination of field experiments a crop model and an optimization algorithm this paper studies a method of optimizing fertilization and verifies the feasibility of the method in the middle of jilin province the main achievements are as follows 1 six parameters of zidantou 1 maize in the dssat model were determined and the accuracy of the dssat model maize yield growth period swc and n content was obtained through the calibration of 2014 data and validation of 2015 data 2 on that basis an optimization method for the maize n fertilizer schedule combining dssat with a ga is proposed under 20 years of meteorological data a novel n fertilizer schedule exhibiting an amount of 198 kg ha is obtained the yield of maize can be boosted by 9 compared with that of a conventional n fertilizer schedule with drip irrigation 3 through an economic benefit analysis it is proven that drip irrigation can effectively improve the economic benefits of maize in central changchun and the optimized n fertilization scheme can increase the benefits by 8 4 and 12 4 compared with a conventional n fertilizer schedule these results prove that the ga and dssat model can promote the optimized fertilizer schedule 4 as a mature optimization algorithm a ga combined with a crop model weather predictions and remote sensing can provide a theoretical basis for future agricultural real time management system optimization declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

10333,determining how to optimize a scientific and efficient farmland nitrogen n fertilizer schedule by combining existing technology is currently a hot topic maize is one of the major crops in china and enhancing the yield of maize is conducive to ensuring china s food security in this study the central region of jilin province was adopted as the research object and a three year 2014 2016 field experiment was performed the data from 2014 were used to calibrate the dssat model and the data from 2015 were used for validation after calibration and validation the dssat model and a genetic algorithm ga were used to optimize the n fertilizer schedule of maize under 20 years 1973 1992 of meteorological data for changchun the experimental data from 2016 were used to validate the results of the optimized n fertilizer schedule as revealed from the results the dssat model effectively simulated the growth and development of maize under drip irrigation and rain fed methods in changchun the model was first calibrated based on the crop yield phenological phases and soil moisture and n content data and good agreement was achieved between the simulated and measured data in both the calibration and validation periods in the calibration and validation periods the normalized root mean square error nrmse for grain yield was 1 45 and 1 61 respectively the total amount in the new n fertilizer schedule is 198 kg ha which is slightly higher than that in the traditional schedule 187 5 kg ha and the yield of maize in the proposed n fertilizer schedule was upregulated by 7 9 compared with the conventional n fertilization schedule in the experimental results for 2016 through an analysis of economic benefits drip irrigation is better than the rain fed method and the optimized n fertilization schedule will make the economic benefits more significant 8 4 12 4 increase additionally this method is easier to combine with remote sensing and weather forecasting forming a real time method of field management optimization schedule decision making keywords maize drip irrigation dssat ga nitrogen fertilizer schedule 1 introduction maize is one of the most popular grain crops in northeast china and increasing maize production is becoming increasingly important in future work wu et al 2019 drip irrigation is one of the most frequently employed measures to save water and boost production and it has been used in maize cultivation in northeast china sui et al 2018 as one of the three golden maize belts jilin china ukraine same latitude america worldwide jilin province is one of the critical grain production regions in china and the yield of maize directly affects chinese food security and crop trade wang et al 2017 in the past irrigation of maize in jilin province generally was in the form of furrow irrigation or rain fed methods as the water saving and grain increasing action project was implemented in four provinces in northeast china by the chinese government over the past few years the form of irrigation of maize in jilin gradually transformed to drip irrigation under film mulch this form of irrigation was verified to boost the maize yield to nearly 16 000 kg hm2 wang et al 2018 applying fertilizer to a field with water is a significantly effective field management model liang et al 2013 drip irrigation combined with the application of nitrogen n fertilizer dissolved in irrigation water usually termed fertigation nourishes crops more precisely than broadcast fertilization and has been verified as an efficient irrigation method to save water and reduce the use of n fertilizer singandhupe et al 2003 tian et al 2017 field experiments were performed to determine the optimal irrigation scheduling and the proper period to inject fertilizers via drip irrigation water in sandy soil to optimize maize yield and water productivity as revealed from the results increasing the amount of irrigation water and the fertilizer application period can facilitate vegetative growth and yield ibrahim et al 2016 based on experimental findings it is possible to control no3 leaching out of the root zone in the growing season with a proper combination of irrigation and fertilizer management gheysari et al 2009 2015 azad et al 2020 conventional maize drip irrigation research tends to use field experiments but field experiments are time consuming and laborious and the number of experimental groups is commonly insufficient subsequently a growing number of researchers have begun to use crop models to simulate the growth of maize jiang et al 2019 dokoohaki et al 2016 babel et al 2019 azad et al 2018 2019 specifically dssat is a comprehensive model for plant simulation and it has been successfully used in many crop simulations worldwide e g irrigation management the effect of climate change on plants and the effect of n on yield jiang et al 2016 bhatia et al 2008 moreover dssat has been extensively employed in maize growth simulations on the whole the dssat ceres maize model performed exceedingly well for the northern transitional zone of karnataka and this model can act as a decision support system tool in agriculture and can be used to study the impacts of climate change on maize crops belay and patil 2017 yakoub et al 2017 proved that a better n fertilizer schedule was obtained by the dssat model corbeels et al 2016 assessed the capability of dssat in simulating crop responses to mulching and investigated the sensitivity of the dssat model output to input parameters paying special attention to the determinants of the model response to the practice of conservation agriculture dssat has been successfully used in drip irrigation simulations for maize l√≥pez cedr√≥n et al 2008 ma et al 2012 fu et al 2020 fang et al 2017 as well as in drip irrigation research on wheat and cotton dar et al 2017 li et al 2019 with the rise of crop models modern optimization algorithms can be used to solve the optimal management system of maize this refers to a nonlinear problem to optimize the fertilization schedule of maize under drip irrigation a genetic algorithm ga is considered a prominent optimization algorithm applied to this type of problem moreover a combination with other model cases can provide the best solution for model simulation ferreiro et al 2016 suhaimi et al 2018 used a ga to solve the optimization problem of agricultural wastewater treatment luo et al 2016 employed a ga to calculate the agricultural and sideline product logistics distribution path planning problem and effective results were achieved allam et al 2016 adopted a ga in a simulation based optimization framework for reuse of agricultural drainage water in irrigation the study of fertilizer schedules of maize drip irrigation is primarily determined by field experiments however the pertinence is relatively strong and the universality is poor crop varieties soil conditions and climate factors in different regions will cause errors in field experimental data as a comprehensive test method is very time consuming and requires a large amount of calculation traditional research on n fertilizer optimization based on dssat is also generally based on orthogonal tests or several established n fertilizer schedules fu et al 2020 which may lead to a local optimal solution therefore the effective combination of a ga and the dssat model can perfectly solve this problem the ga only needs to give the range of the fertilization amount in each stage and can solve the problem with a larger search range and higher efficiency to delve into the optimal n fertilizer schedule under the full drip irrigation mode in northeast china and to make the simulation method easier to promote a three year 2014 2016 field experiment was performed in this study to calibrate data from 2014 and validate data from 2015 the dssat model moreover the optimized fertilization schedule was solved by combining the dssat model with a ga according to the weather data from 1973 to 1992 in changchun then data from 2016 were used to validate the optimized n fertilizer schedule the present study primarily aims to 1 explore the optimal n fertilization schedule in the central part of jilin province 2 validate the feasibility of the method combining dssat with a ga and obtain a theoretical reference for its promotion and 3 investigate the application of optimization algorithms remote sensing climate prediction and crop models in future agricultural real time optimization management systems 2 materials

superphosphate and 120 kg k2o ha 1 as potassium sulfate were applied in the field the aim of these three years of experiments is as follows the first two years are adopted to calibrate 2014 and validate 2015 the dssat parameters subsequently the dssat model and ga are integrated to determine the optimized n fertilizer schedule with 20 year 1973 1992 weather data the data from 2016 are exploited to validate the optimized n fertilizer schedule 2 2 measurement methods of parameters 2 2 1 soil moisture and fertility soil was collected by an auger and then transferred to the laboratory for subsequent measurement the available n was measured with a k1160 kjeldahl nitrogen analyzer from shandong manon scientific instrument co ltd the available potassium organic matter and available phosphorus were determined by a zyd tf soil nutrient quick tester from beijing zhiyunda technology co ltd with tzs 1k soil moisture probes from nanjing tuopu technology co ltd the soil water content swc was measured each day 2 2 2 plant measurements the measured plant factors consisted of plant height stem diameter leaf area index lai n quality and dry matter quality at each growth phase a meter

area was measured with a ymj a from zhejiang tuopuyun agricultural technology co ltd and the lai can be calculated by 2 lai 1 n l si i a where n l is the number of plants per plot si is the total leaf area per plant si i denotes the sum of the leaf area per plot and a is the area covered per plot 2 2 3 measurements of meteorological factors the meteorological data from 2014 to 2016 collected in this experiment are elucidated as solar radiation air temperature wind speed evaporation and rainfall in the vicinity of the test area a watchdog meteorological automatic recorder was installed to automatically collect the mentioned meteorological information every 5 min and automatic recording was achieved all the mentioned data for the period of 1973 1992 were harvested from the changchun meteorological station 43 88 n 125 26 e located in lvyuan district 2 2 4 plant growth and yield measurements the yield measurement area was taken as 1 3 15 m for the plots for drip irrigation furrow irrigation and the rain fed method the grain yields were measured with 12 water content other factors were measured with the following methods ear number all the production ears in the yield

denotes the grain yield under the application of n fertilizer and n rate represents the amount of n fertilizer 2 3 model and data analyses 2 3 1 dssat model 2 3 1 1 input model data the main input data in dssat include soil data climate data crop cultivar coefficients and management data soil data the soil information is the physical and chemical characteristics including soil texture percentages of sand silt and clay bulk density soil n soil organic carbon and water capacity for each soil layer table 1 weather data since the maize model in dssat is simulated every day a daily format is also needed for meteorological data the minimum meteorological input of the model is the daily rainfall solar radiation and the maximum and minimum temperatures all of which are obtained by the field weather station section 2 2 3 management data the management data include the irrigation schedule planting method fertilizer schedule planting date harvest date and so on section 2 1 crop cultivar coefficients crop cultivar coefficients are required to simulate crop growth rates and stages biomass production and grain yield liu et al 2013 the genetic coefficients of each crop cultivar were manually adjusted to reach an accurate goodness of fit between the simulated and measured datasets a new cultivar was built for the calibration of maize in dssat namely zidantou 1 there are six cultivar coefficients for maize in dssat which are p1 degree days base 8 c from emergence to the end of the juvenile phase p2 photoperiod sensitivity coefficient 0 1 0 p5 degree days base 8 c from silking to physiological maturity g2 potential kernel number g3 potential kernel growth rate mg kernel d and phint degree days required for a leaf tip to emerge phyllochron interval c d 2 3 1 2 methodology the methodology of the maize model in dssat is as follows the dynamic changes in soil moisture and nonstandard crop yield can be simulated by simulating the distribution function of soil nonstandard biomass and n all of these simulations are performed daily at the end of each day plant growth soil moisture and carbon and n balances are updated biomass formation is directly driven by solar radiation and affected by the external environment biomass allocation was different in different growth stages 2 3 1 3 output data the yield of maize growth period and variations in swc and soil n content were the output data and were used to calibrate and validate the model 2 3 2 ga model 2 3 2 1 input model data the ga needs initial input data including the initial population genetic algebra fitness selection method crossover method and mutation method initial population in this study the population number is 10 and the genetic algebra reaches 1000 the string length of each n fertilization factor encoded by binary code is 6 and each population individual covers 5 fertilization factors so the long tail of the population individual string is expressed as 5 6 30 the range of each n amount in different periods is shown in table 5 fitness function the fitness function of the ga is critical to the solution and the fitness function is determined based on the annual yield income and the input amount of n fertilizer the main independent variable refers to the amount of fertilizer and the dependent variable is the yield the fitness equation is written as 4 f x 1 n y r n r n where y r denotes the profit from the yield n r is the cost of the amount of n fertilizer the price of n fertilizer is 4 yuan kg and the price of maize is 3 yuan kg selection method selection is used to determine the number of individuals after crossover mutation by evaluating the fitness of individuals and this method has a great impact on the efficiency and convergence of the ga this paper uses roulette selection which is a playback random sampling method all the choices are to select good individuals from the current population according to the fitness values of the individuals and some criteria to enter the next generation population the probability of each individual entering the next generation is equal to the ratio of its fitness value to the sum of individual fitness values in the whole population the higher the fitness value is the greater the possibility of being selected and the greater the probability of entering the next generation crossover method crossover is a step in which two homologous chromosomes generate a new generation of chromosomes through mating and recombination and two individuals are selected from the population according to the probability of exchanging a group of genes the newly generated individuals inherit the basic characteristics of their parents and push the population to the optimal solution in this paper single point crossover is used which means that only one crossover point is randomly set in the coding string of individuals and then some chromosomes of two paired individuals are exchanged with each other at this point the crossover probability is 0 9 in this paper mutation method mutation is used to change a gene of an individual with a small probability and then generate a new individual this method determines the local search ability of the ga the crossover operator and mutation operator cooperate with each other to complete the mutual supplement of global and local search of the algorithm which provides support for the optimization process in this paper we use gene mutation which refers to an individual coding string above the mutation probability and the value of a certain or several randomly assigned loci is used for the mutation operation the mutation coefficient is 0 1 in this paper 2 3 2 2 methodology a ga is a kind of randomized search method that is based on the principle of evolution in the biological world survival of the fittest its main characteristics are that it can operate directly on structural objects without the limitation of derivation and function continuity and it has inherent implicit parallelism and good global optimization ability using a probabilistic optimization method the optimization space can be obtained and guided automatically and the search direction can be adjusted adaptively without definite rules these properties of gas have been widely used in combinatorial optimization machine learning signal processing adaptive control and artificial life it is a key technology in modern intelligent computing 2 3 2 3 output data when the simulation steps are input to the genetic algebra the optimized n fertilizer schedule simulation results are output 2 3 3 combining the ga with dssat the steps of the combined dssat and ga are illustrated in fig 3 the first generation population generated by the ga is substituted into dssat to obtain the results the optimal selection is made from the results after crossover and mutation operations the population is replaced in dssat until the target genetic algebra is reached finally the calculation is stopped and the optimized n fertilizer schedule is output 2 3 4 data analysis the yield component data were analyzed by variance tests in spss 14 0 in all cases differences are considered to exhibit statistical significance if p 0 05 to verify whether the model results perform well the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae average root mean square error nrmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse are adopted error analysis is conducted to determine the differences between the assessed and measured data the rmse mae nmsre and nse are calculated as follows 5 mae 1 n 1 n x i y i 6 rmse 1 n x i y i 2 n 7 nrmse rmse y 100 8 nse 1 1 n y i x i 2 1 n y i y 2 where n denotes the number of lateral measuring points and x and y represent the calculated and measured values respectively 3 results 3 1 analysis of maize parameters 3 1 1 lai the lai of maize is one of the major parameters used to assess the growth and development of maize this value has an effect on the photosynthesis respiration and transpiration of maize with an increase in the lai the metabolic capacity of maize is enhanced duan et al 2014 the lai of all treatments in 2014 and 2015 varied with the growth cycle fig 4 in the ve and vt periods the growth rate of the lai was the maximum and then it gradually decreased it peaked at r2 and then decreased again due to dehydration and shrinkage of the leaves these results suggest that the lai of the drip irrigation group is significantly higher than that of the rain fed group demonstrating that drip irrigation can effectively elevate the lai of the maize residual cycle in accordance with previous research results liu et al 2017 3 1 2 plant height the plant height of maize can effectively indicate the growth and development of maize gao et al 2013 and the plant height of maize varies with the growth period fig 5 in the ve vj and vt periods the growth rate of the plant height is the maximum and then it tends to decrease the plant height decreases due to the fragile fracture of stamens after dehydration in the r6 period in addition drip irrigation can effectively increase the plant height of maize compared with that of the rain fed group the average increases by 18 7 in the r2 stage the variation trend is consistent with existing research results kang et al 2010 3 1 3 production factors of maize in all the treatments the 100 grain weight ranged from 28 45 to 31 45 g table 6 and irrigation significantly impacted the 100 grain weight of maize the 100 grain weight of maize under drip irrigation was 9 higher than that under the rain fed method the ear diameter ranged from 4 0 to 4 2 cm in all the treatments table 6 different irrigation methods slightly impact maize diameter the ear length ranged from 18 83 to 24 27 cm in all the treatments table 6 and irrigation noticeably impacted the ear length of maize the ear length of the drip irrigation group was 20 4 higher than that of the rain fed group the number of grains per ear ranged from 551 to 623 in all the treatments table 6 compared with the rain fed group the drip irrigation group increased the number of grains per ear by 10 8 moreover the ear number ranged from 58 715 to 65 961 in all the treatments table 6 and this factor was 6 smaller in the data from 2014 than in the data from 2015 for an identical irrigation method the yield in 2015 was less than that in 2014 probably due to the hail that occurred on may 30 2015 hail kills some maize seedlings and the mean ear number in 2015 was 6 less than that in 2014 3 2 model calibration and validation the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue coefficient estimator combined with a trial and error method is employed to assess the genetic parameters jiang et al 2019 in this study the mentioned parameters of maize are calibrated based on data from 2014 and the results are validated with data from 2015 the six parameters of zidantou 1 maize are listed in table 7 the differences between the measured and simulated data are listed in table 8 e g harvest yield emergence anthesis and grain filling dates it is therefore demonstrated that the simulated values agree well with the measured values compared with the rain fed method drip irrigation slightly shortened the growth period of maize table 8 and the yield of maize under drip irrigation was 28 7 and 26 2 higher than that under the rain fed method in 2014 and 2015 respectively the nrmse values of the yield in 2014 calibration and 2015 validation are 1 45 and 1 61 respectively the mae values for the growth periods in 2014 calibration and 2015 validation are 1 1 5 and 0 3 respectively and these values prove that the model provides a good simulation result the model performance statistics rmse nrmse mae and nse for swc and soil no3 n content at different depths for the calibration 2014 and validation 2015 datasets are summarized in table 9 for the calibration and validation datasets the rmse nrmse mae and nse values for swc ranged from 0 0186 to 0 0292 cm3 cm3 10 83 17 57 0 0153 0 024 cm3 cm3 and 0 82 0 923 respectively indicating good agreement between the simulated and measured water contents the simulation accuracy for soil no3 n content was also found to be acceptable with rmse values of 0 3957 4 8658 mg kg nrmse values of 14 13 31 08 mae values of 0 3076 3 5454 mg kg and nse values of 0 7881 0 956 which indicated a good performance of the model fig 6 compares the simulated and measured swc and soil no3 n content at various depths during the 2014 season calibration data to illustrate the capability of the model for capturing the temporal and spatial trends of swc and soil no3 n content the simulated and measured swc increased greatly following an irrigation or precipitation event and then decreased gradually due to drainage and evapotranspiration in changchun the rainfall was sufficient in the early stage the swc was generally high and the rainfall decreased in the later stage fig 1 irrigation was started with the increase in crop water consumption and the swc changed with irrigation the surface soil had a strong response to rainfall and irrigation the swc of the surface soil increased greatly after rainfall and irrigation the soil no3 n content changed significantly with the fertilization time and the deeper the soil was the smaller the change which corresponded to the lower soil no3 n content in deep soil table 1 these results suggest that dssat can simulate the changes in swc and soil no3 n content 3 3 model application 3 3 1 analysis of 20 year operation simulation data from running the dssat and ga model the simulated changes in maize yield under 20 years 1973 1992 of meteorological data are presented in fig 7 and the precipitation in changchun ranges from 500 mm to 700 mm the irrigation methods are divided into the rain fed method and drip irrigation and the drip irrigation schedule is based on eq 1 the n fertilizer schedules are divided into n1 and n2 according to table 4 the maize variety is the same as zidantou 1 and the soil data are the same as those presented in table 1 the ridge spacing is 65 cm and the plant density is 62 500 plants ha according to the experimental experience the sowing date is set to may 1 and the harvest date is set to october 1 the simulation results are listed in table 10 in which individual 8 is not consistent with the other individuals as the mutation probability is set to 0 1 most of the population is the same demonstrating that the genetic results are converged the yield of maize with drip irrigation and the n2 n fertilizer schedule is higher than that with n1 whereas the result is the opposite for the rain fed group table 11 3 3 2 validation of optimization results the results of the field experiments performed in 2016 were used to validate the optimized n fertilizer schedule the simulation results are listed in table 12 the rmse nrmse mae and nse values for the yield reach 173 kg ha 1 56 156 5 kg ha and 0 985 respectively demonstrating that the dssat model achieves good simulation results the yield of maize with the n2 fertilizer schedule increases by 7 and 9 with the rain fed and drip irrigation methods respectively compared to that with n1 the nue values for drip irrigation are 26 2 and 28 8 higher than those for the rain fed treatment in n1 and n2 respectively and the rmse nrmse mae and nse values for nue reach 0 92 kg kg 1 6 0 824 kg kg and 0 983 respectively 3 4 economic analysis the costs of land use and insecticide are basically the same in each treatment table 13 because the drip irrigation group has to lay the drip pipeline manually the cost of labor and machinery operating cost will be much higher than those for the rain fed group compared with the rain fed group the drip irrigation group also has to pay for electricity and water the drip irrigation system costs more in the first year and the benefits of the drip irrigation group are lower than those of the rain fed group however from the second year on the main project of drip irrigation does not need to be reinvested and only part of it needs to be repaired and replaced thus the cost is greatly reduced the benefits of the drip irrigation group are much higher than those of the rain fed group in 2015 and 2016 table 12 comparing the n1 and n2 treatment groups the n2 treatment can effectively improve the economic benefits for both the rain fed group 8 4 increase and the drip irrigation group 12 4 increase 4 discussion 4 1 the main results of this research 4 1 1 the yield and nue the yield of maize under drip irrigation was 28 7 26 2 and 28 9 higher than that under rain fed treatment in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively it is therefore verified that drip irrigation can effectively boost the yield of maize in northeast china and this finding is consistent with previous studies wang et al 2018 wu et al 2019 guo et al 2017 liu et al 2017 table 8 suggests that the yield of maize in 2015 was significantly lower than that in 2014 which may have been caused by the hail that occurred on may 30 2015 hail kills some maize seedlings and the mean ear number in 2015 was 6 less than that in 2014 table 5 the maximum yield in this paper was 12 951 kg ha in 2016 table 12 which is slightly lower than that found in previous studies in northeast china sui et al 2018 reported a maximum yield of 14 585 kg ha with a plant density of 61 438 plants ha under drip irrigation with film mulching in heilongjiang province china the plant density in their study is similar to ours and the difference in yield may be caused by film mulching as many studies have proven that film mulching can increase the yield du et al 2008 ning et al 2015 yang et al 2017 this paper considered the high cost of digestion film mulching and nondigestion film mulching will contaminate the environment fan et al 2012 2017 hou et al 2010 so no film mulching technology was used wu et al 2019 found a maximum yield of 15 688 kg ha with a planting density of 70 000 plants ha through two years of field experiments with drip irrigation and film mulching in jilin china the plant density in their study is much higher than ours and may be the major reason that their yield is much higher zidantou 1 is not a close planting maize variety the planting density is based on the local average planting level and lodging prevention is set in future work close planting of maize will be tried however the problem that overplanting may lead to serious degradation of soil fertility will also be investigated the nue of drip irrigation is higher than that of the rain fed method table 12 as drip irrigation is more beneficial to the utilization of n fertilizer it can also more effectively play the role of n fertilizer zou et al 2020 a significant interaction is identified between water and fertilizer zheng et al 2020 the optimized fertilization schedule can enhance the nue table 12 as proven previously wortmann et al 2011 wang et al 2018 moreover the nue for the rain fed method is significantly lower than that for drip irrigation drip irrigation will enhance the nue more than conventional irrigation ju et al 2009 wang et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 the optimized fertilization system is capable of slightly improving the nue and a reasonable fertilization schedule can help enhance fertilizer utilization efficiency zhang et al 2016 the nue of drip irrigation ranges from 50 kg kg to 65 3 kg kg table 12 which is consistent with previous studies sui et al 2018 wang et al 2018 sui et al 2018 reported nue values from 36 24 kg kg to 73 43 kg kg with drip irrigation and wang et al 2018 reported nue values from 42 7 kg kg to 80 3 kg kg with drip irrigation our values fall in the middle and upper parts of these ranges because of the principle of diminishing benefits the more fertilizer that is applied the lower the utilization rate of fertilizer the less fertilizer there is the higher the fertilizer utilization rate but the lower the yield wang et al 2018 recommended an n amount of 240 kg ha and the benefit was the highest at an nue value of 67 1 kg kg sui et al 2018 recommended an n amount of 230 kg ha and the benefit was the highest at an nue value of 61 4 kg kg in this paper we recommend an nue value of 65 3 kg kg for a n amount of 198 kg ha which is between those values provided and indicates that our results are reliable 4 1 2 model application and economic considerations the dssat model has been successfully used in the simulation of maize with drip irrigation in previous studies l√≥pez cedr√≥n et al 2008 ma et al 2012 fu et al 2020 fang et al 2017 however the model needs to be calibrated and validated before use amouzou et al 2018 in this paper the error analysis of the yield and growth period between the simulated and measured data is in line with the requirements and is also relatively consistent with previous studies jiang et al 2016 in addition to these calibrations swc and soil n content also need to be further considered the rmse value of swc in 2014 and 2015 ranged from 0 0186 to 0 0292 cm3 cm3 which is similar to that in kandelous and simunek 2010 who reported values of 0 01 0 05 cm3 cm3 the rmse of soil no3 n content ranged from 0 3957 to 4 8658 mg kg the simulation accuracy for soil no3 n content was also found to be acceptable as doltra and mu√±oz 2010 reported rmse values of 1 9 6 7 mg kg this proved that dssat can be successfully used in the simulations in this paper the simulation of the optimized n fertilizer system is also very successful as shown through the validation of the data from 2016 table 12 and the model can better predict the optimized n fertilizer schedule with acceptable error analysis jiang et al 2016 through benefit analysis we found that in the first year we need to make a large investment in drip irrigation equipment and the planting income is not as high as that of ordinary planting however from the second year with costs only from partial maintenance and replacement of drip irrigation equipment the economic benefits gradually increase table 14 these results prove that drip irrigation is feasible in northeast china and this finding is consistent with previous research sui et al 2018 wang et al 2018 wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 drip irrigation not only increased the yield of maize but also improved the water and fertilizer use efficiencies providing a solid foundation for food security wang et al 2018 the n2 treatment increased the nue of n fertilizer by 5 6 the yield by 9 table 13 and the economic benefit by 12 4 compared to the n1 treatment table 14 therefore the optimized n fertilizer schedule n2 recommended in this paper is completely feasible 4 2 the limitations of this study and future work 4 2 1 the limitations of this study in this study based on full irrigation the optimal schedule of n fertilizer was considered in fact past research has also shown a significant effect between water and fertilizer irmak et al 2016 limited irrigation may also improve the water and n use efficiencies sui et al 2018 in future research we will need to combine irrigation systems to give a reasonable field management system on the other hand this paper uses a crop model and optimization algorithm to give the optimal n schedule and this approach has universality however the validation of this method is carried out only in northeast china and the method needs to be verified in more places in the future 4 2 2 future work in recent years field experiments combined with crop model simulations have been used to determine management schedules since crop models can dynamically quantify crop growth responses to farmland environments however most studies on optimizing management strategies using crop models have focused on management scheduling options based on limited experimental data and simulations with long term weather data anothai et al 2013 he et al 2013 lopez et al 2017 however there are still many problems to be overcome in order to apply this approach to real time simulation 1 determining how to use crop simulation models for irrigation scheduling based on real time weather conditions 2 determining how to calibrate crop models in real time and 3 determining how to optimize management schedules in real time for weather problems some researchers have used historical weather data and real time weather data to generate multiple complete climate data series covering the whole growing season to predict crop growth and yield bannayan and hoogenboom 2008 lawless and semenov 2005 in this way weather series can be generated on each day of the growing season by combining local history with newly measured daily weather data therefore it is possible to predict the growth of maize and the grain yield related to actual weather conditions on each day before harvest chen et al 2017 chen et al 2020 provided a new tool for dynamic irrigation schedules in the maize production season in northwest china by this method the real time simulation effect of the model may not perform as well for sudden changes in climate and other factors so we need to use some means to calibrate the model simulation data remote sensing and crop models are becoming important tools that help in water and n balances and yield forecasting guo et al 2018 leroux et al 2019 the real time and macro characteristics of remote sensing rs data complement the continuity and mechanisms of crop growth models these data can facilitate the application of crop models at spatial scales help to monitor crop growth and provide large scale crop yield estimates jin et al 2018 the lai is commonly used as validation data in crop models and hosseini et al 2015 jin et al 2017 and ahmad et al 2018 planned verification of the lai to forecast crop yield by using both remote sensing and crop modeling there are certain solutions to the above two problems but traditional management system optimization is based on a fixed experimental schedule when the climate changes suddenly a traditional management scheme is no longer effective determining how to fully consider the climate model accuracy and coupling of water and fertilizer is the key to giving a reasonable management schedule in real time a ga can provide a basis for the scope of irrigation and amount of fertilizer to optimize the best management system schedule which can be predicted for input into a real time model the combination of a ga and crop model can provide such a schedule as shown in fig 8 in future research we can make full use of existing climate prediction models and remote sensing correction methods to continuously correct the model in real time and achieve immediate optimization of a field management system 5 conclusions through a combination of field experiments a crop model and an optimization algorithm this paper studies a method of optimizing fertilization and verifies the feasibility of the method in the middle of jilin province the main achievements are as follows 1 six parameters of zidantou 1 maize in the dssat model were determined and the accuracy of the dssat model maize yield growth period swc and n content was obtained through the calibration of 2014 data and validation of 2015 data 2 on that basis an optimization method for the maize n fertilizer schedule combining dssat with a ga is proposed under 20 years of meteorological data a novel n fertilizer schedule exhibiting an amount of 198 kg ha is obtained the yield of maize can be boosted by 9 compared with that of a conventional n fertilizer schedule with drip irrigation 3 through an economic benefit analysis it is proven that drip irrigation can effectively improve the economic benefits of maize in central changchun and the optimized n fertilization scheme can increase the benefits by 8 4 and 12 4 compared with a conventional n fertilizer schedule these results prove that the ga and dssat model can promote the optimized fertilizer schedule 4 as a mature optimization algorithm a ga combined with a crop model weather predictions and remote sensing can provide a theoretical basis for future agricultural real time management system optimization declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
10334,quantifying groundwater recharge from irrigation practices of arid regions is necessary for efficient and sustainable groundwater resources management recharge is difficult to measure directly many studies have quantified recharge from agricultural fields as a residual of the soil water balance method wbm or by other mathematical models estimating evapotranspiration et and measuring soil moisture rainfall and irrigation et is often estimated using weather parameters from climate stations that are distant from crops flooding of fields is the most common form of irrigation used by farmers in the mesilla valley new mexico to grow alfalfa one of the state s major crops the objectives of this study were to quantify recharge in flood irrigated alfalfa fields in the mesilla valley new mexico using the wbm and actual et measurements during the 2017 growing season the study fields were different sizes crop ages and soil textures actual et of alfalfa was measured on the largest field using the eddy covariance energy budget method and applied to the two other nearby fields as estimated et all other wbm parameters were measured at each study site i e soil moisture rainfall and applied irrigation recharge using et referenced to grass etsz was then calculated using weather parameters and compared with measured et recharge ranged from 618 to 716 mm with no significant statistical differences between the three alfalfa fields f ratio of 0 8876 and a p value of 0 42 using anova recharge to irrigation ratio ranged from 37 to 45 on farm irrigation efficiency ranged from 54 86 to 59 94 when compared to measured et etsz underestimated recharge of alfalfa by 11 in the wbm and overestimated recharge by 6 when a reduction in etsz during harvest periods are considered the results show that the measurement of actual et improved recharge estimates in the alfalfa fields keywords flood irrigation groundwater deep percolation soil moisture eddy covariance 1 introduction irrigated river valleys of the western u s and arid regions worldwide are facing water shortages brought on by many factors such as prolonged drought competing water uses from municipal and industrial users and changing agricultural land use and cropping patterns that use more water per unit of land farmers and water managers need tools to more accurately quantify water budgets and enable better water management for the viability of irrigated agriculture better information is needed to characterize the interactions between surface water and groundwater that are so important in irrigated river valleys recharge to groundwater from surface water irrigation is particularly important for the longevity of the groundwater resource in dry regions the mesilla valley along the rio grande river in south central new mexico is emblematic of an arid region irrigated river valley with stressed groundwater and recharge from irrigation the hydrogeology of the valley is such that the surface water i e the rio grande is connected to the shallow flood plain alluvium aquifer wilson et al 1981 according to conover 1954 the average recharge from precipitation infiltration is small the groundwater in the valley is recharged from seepage in certain stretches of the river and canals infiltration from irrigation groundwater flow from mesas and other elevated areas and precipitation in the floodplain conover 1954 flooding is the most common irrigation practice although sprinkler and underground drip irrigation methods are recently being introduced by some farmers usda 2018 however deep percolation beneath flood irrigated fields is not well understood and is difficult to measure directly bethune et al 2008 arnold 2011 ochoa et al 2012 alfalfa is an economically important crop in new mexico that is commonly flood irrigated usda 2018 lauriault et al 2017 in 2017 the state reported a harvest of nearly 77 000 ha of alfalfa hay valued at 171 000 000 us dollars in the mesilla valley alfalfa ranks second by area behind pecans usda 2018 as the demand for groundwater increases in the region due to prolonged drought quantifying groundwater recharge through deep percolation from flood irrigation is necessary for efficient and sustainable groundwater resources management quantifying groundwater recharge deep percolation of flood irrigation is important for water management in arid regions several techniques to quantify groundwater recharge have been described by scanlon et al 2002 a simple and commonly used method is the water balance method wbm the wbm has been used to estimate deep percolation below the plant root zone scanlon et al 2002 arnold 2011 ochoa et al 2012 gutierrez jurado et al 2017 and the results have been used to calibrate and check other deep percolation models and methods deb et al 2012 as mentioned by scanlon et al 2002 however the limitations of estimating recharge as a residual in the wbm depend on the accuracy with which the components of the budget are measured a major limitation is the actual measurement of evapotranspiration et actual measurements of et using methods such as eddy covariance bowen ratio and others rely on expensive sensors and equipment additionally they require special expertise experience and large fields for adequate fetch distance rosenberg et al 1983 jensen et al 1990 brutsaert et al 2005 studies in a similar climate to the mesilla valley that incorporated the wbm estimated et indirectly from climate data e g ochoa et al 2012 gutierrez jurado et al 2017 estimation of et from climate data however is prone to errors due to the quality of climate data the proximity of climate stations with respect to the fields and the harvesting periods of crops e g cutting of alfalfa is often ignored the objective of this study was to quantify the recharge considered as deep percolation past the plant root zone of groundwater from three flood irrigated fields of alfalfa crop medicago sativa l using measured soil moisture precipitation amount of irrigation applied and actual measured et i e where measurements are possible in the wbm 2 materials and methods 2 1 site descriptions the mesilla valley is part of the rio grande flood plain in south central new mexico it extends from leasburg dam at radium springs new mexico to the west side of el paso texas near international dam a distance of about 96 km it includes about 36 400 ha of bottom valley land where agriculture has been active for centuries conover 1954 due to fertile soil and availability of good irrigation water from the rio grande and groundwater the flow of the rio grande in the valley has been channeled its flow is controlled by the releases of water from caballo reservoir approximately 72 km north of the mesilla valley farmers in the mesilla valley often pump groundwater from their wells to supplement surface water to meet the crop irrigation needs during the water scarce periods wozniak 1998 this study was performed on three alfalfa fields referred to as horse farm leyendecker and willie s fig 1 new mexico state university nmsu owns and manages the alfalfa fields in the horse farm and the leyendecker plant science research center whereas willie s is privately owned the horse farm and leyendecker fields were about 2 ha each and willie s was the largest among the three fields with an area of 35 2 ha the horse farm was about 5 km from the rio grande whereas leyendecker and willies were located within a kilometer of river table 1 alfalfa of the horse farm was the youngest it was seeded in march 2017 willie s and leyendecker alfalfa were seeded in 2014 and 2013 respectively the horse farm and willie s alfalfa fields were dense uniform and monotypic in contrast the leyendecker field was composed of 50 alfalfa and 50 native grasses including saltgrass distichlis spicata var stricta l and yellow bristle grass setaria pumila 2 1 1 climate the climate of the region is described by malm 1994 as an arid southwestern united states climate with annual average precipitation of 222 mm per year more than 75 of the precipitation falls during the warm monsoonal months of july through september the mean annual temperature based on a 108 year climate record of the city of las cruces is 15 8 c and an average diurnal temperature of 17 8 c malm 1994 winds are usually light during summer months and moderately strong with occasional gusts in spring and winter 2 1 2 geology and soil texture the mesilla valley is dominated by sediments largely derived from alluvial and fluvial process and are composed of mainly gravel sand silt and some clay hawley et al 2001 the us department of agriculture usda natural resources conservation service nrcs web soil survey usda nrcs wss shows that the surface soil of willie s field is mainly silty loam and leyendecker and horse farm fields are clay loam a total of 18 soil samples 3 samples at each depth for subsurface textural analysis were collected at the center of each study site during the installation of the soil moisture profile sampling was conducted in 30 cm increments from the surface to 180 cm depth a hydrometer method test was performed on soil samples to determine their respective textures at each depth table 2 following astm 2017 international standard for hydrometer testing willie s leyendecker and horse farm s surface soil to 30 cm depth were determined as silt loam clay and clay loam respectively the tilling and mixing of the soils on these fields have changed the soil texture over time but in general our assessment of the topsoil texture is similar to those reported by the usda nrcs wss the textures of soil samples taken at different depths 30 180 cm for the three fields range from fine to coarse texture two horizons of soils were visible during the installation of groundwater monitoring wells at all of the fields generally the top 0 90 cm was fine textured soils and 90 610 cm was coarse sandy textured soils 2 2 groundwater recharge groundwater recharge dw is considered here as deep percolation beneath the crop root zone it is determined as a residual in the soil water balance equation eq 1 as 1 d w i r r e Œ¥s et where ir is the amount of irrigation in mm applied during the period re is the amount of rainfall in mm that does not run off the area during the period et is the amount of evapotranspiration in mm during the period and Œ¥s is the change in soil water storage in mm over the period there was no runoff of irrigation water leaving the fields since all fields were laser leveled and bordered the effects of groundwater contribution to the plant root zone as a source of water for plants were not considered since the groundwater was deep 3 25 m at all the experiment sites field observation during excavation at the three farms showed alfalfa roots extending to a maximum of 1 2 m deep eq 1 characterized the soil water status within the plant root zone of 120 cm and dw below 120 cm assuming i soil water content within the 120 cm profile varied in one dimensional vertical direction ii surface to 160 cm depth soil textures are homogenous throughout the field iii capillary rise was negligible since the groundwater table was too deep iv the Œ¥s measurements represented the entire alfalfa field and v deep percolation is assumed to eventually reach groundwater 2 2 1 irrigation the fields were irrigated by flooding using pumped groundwater and or surface water from the rio grande surface water in the mesilla valley is managed and supplied to farmers by the local irrigation district using a network of irrigation canals all the fields were laser leveled and bordered before planting alfalfa at willie s alfalfa was irrigated using groundwater irrigation pump and by surface water when available the irrigation water from the well or surface water was conveyed by a concrete lined trapezoidal canal to the field the canal was 0 61 m at the base 2 13 m at the crest and 0 91 m deep flow in the canal was measured using a simple trapezoidal flume st flume with a circular stilling well as described by samani 2017 the depth of water in the stilling well was measured using a pressure transducer model cs450 and a cr200 datalogger both from campbell scientific inc csi logan utah flow measured by the flume was verified using a current velocity meter model 2100 swoffer instruments inc federal way washington following the usgs velocity area method turnipseed and sauer 2010 accuracy of most discharge measurements considered qualitatively a good measurement is about 5 turnipseed and sauer 2010 the error of the current meter used in this study when appropriately calibrated is about 1 swoffer instruments inc manual federal way washington groundwater at willie s was pumped from the ground through a metered pipe where the total volume of water discharged was monitored every irrigation the water from the well was discharged in the same canal which was also used for surface water irrigation to deliver water to the field irrigation infrastructures at horse farm and leyendecker were connected to a groundwater well and a pump leyendecker had the capability of pumping surface water through the same system which conveyed groundwater allowing both surface water pumped from a canal and groundwater to be measured during each irrigation the amount of water pumped from each of the wells at horse farm and leyendecker were monitored by a meter that was mounted in their respective discharge pipes the meters were manually read before and after irrigations to determine the total volume of water pumped the volume of water applied to the fields was divided by the irrigated land area to determine the depth in mm of irrigation water applied 2 2 2 rainfall precipitation in the mesilla valley is mostly in the form of rain rainfall was measured by a climate station known as leyendecker iii weather station 32 12 3 26 n 106 44 34 00 w elevation 1176 m amsl located inside the nmsu leyendecker plant science research center and near the leyendecker alfalfa field the station is located about 0 62 km from willie s and 8 2 km from the horse farm rainfall was measured using a tb4 rain gage csi logan utah the tb4 rain gage has a 203 2 mm orifice and measures rainfall in 0 254 mm increments using an internal siphon and a typing bucket mechanism 2 2 3 actual evapotranspiration evapotranspiration was measured using the energy budget method eq 2 at willie s in the center of the field to ensure adequate fetch the soil moisture profile and depth to groundwater were also measured alongside the et the location of the eddy covariance ec system is denoted by the symbol x in fig 1 the components of the energy budget including net radiation soil heat and sensible heat fluxes are measured and latent heat is determined as a residual following the methodology presented in bawazir et al 2014 latent heat flux le is converted to an equivalent depth of water or et in mm by dividing latent heat flux by latent heat of vaporization of water i e 2 45 mj kg at normal temperatures and density of water 1000 kg m¬≥ 2 l e r n g h where le is latent heat rn is net radiation g is soil heat and h is sensible heat all these energy fluxes are measured in w m2 sensible heat is measured using the eddy covariance technique swinbank 1951 rosenberg et al 1983 brutsaert et al 2005 where vertical wind speed and air temperature in the lower atmospheric boundary layer are correlated eq 3 3 h p c p w t where p is the mean density of air cp is the air heat capacity at constant pressure and w t is the covariance between fluctuations of vertical wind speed w and temperature t the instrumentation used in measuring the components of the energy budget in eq 2 included three dimensional sonic anemometer model csat3 csi logan utah to measure sensible heat net radiometer model nr lite csi logan utah to measure net radiation two soil heat flux plates model hft3 rebs inc csi in combination with soil moisture sensor model cs 616 csi logan utah and a pair of two averaging soil temperature thermocouples model cav csi logan utah to measure soil heat flux additional sensors were installed to measure relative humidity and ambient air temperature model hmp45c csi logan utah csat3 and hmp45c were mounted on a tripod at 2 5 m above the ground in the middle of willie s field the csat3 was leveled and oriented towards prevailing wind with an adequate fetch distance of more than 250 m in each direction an effort was made to minimize potential errors due to sensor mounting and measurement in the field to check for energy budget closure of eq 2 open path licor 7500 li cor biosciences lincoln nebraska coupled with csat3 was used to measure le following burba and anderson 2005 4 l e Œª w q where Œª is the latent heat of vaporization of water and w q is the covariance between the fluctuation of vertical wind speed w and vapor density q a net radiometer was mounted on a separate pole nearby at a height of 1 94 m from the ground surface the two soil heat flux plates were installed at 8 cm below the ground surface and separated by about a meter the plates were installed in such a way that they capture heat flux underneath the plants and in open spaces that would be exposed to sunlight during alfalfa cutting periods the pair of averaging soil temperature sensors were then installed at 2 cm and 6 cm below the ground and above the soil heat flux plates the soil moisture sensor was installed at a 45 degree angle to measure soil moisture in the upper soil layer for use in determining the rate of soil heat storage as part of soil heat flux calculations data were collected at 10 hz using cr5000 datalogger csi logan utah and averaged every 30 min the entire setup i e system was powered by a battery and solar panels the footprint of ec measurements at the site was determined using scaling procedure following kljun et al 2004 the footprint ranged from 2 m to 234 m with an average of 37 m for 30 min data n 13 378 at 90 of the scaled footprint from the ec sensor or receptor the minimum distance to the edge of the field from the ec sensors was 230 m and located in the north eastern quadrant where the prevailing wind was minimum the distance to the edge of the field for the rest of the quadrants was at least 274 m 234 m and therefore satisfying the required footprint of et measurements by the ec technique measurement of fluxes such as le and sensible heat h using the ec measurement technique have to be corrected due to assumptions in the methodology instrumentation problems physical phenomena and terrain burba and anderson 2005 aubinet et al 2012 data collected by csat3 were corrected for sonic temperature massman and lee 2002 frequency attenuation massman 2000 2001 and cross contamination using a double rotation scheme tanner and thurtell 1969 lee et al 2004 errors attributed to regular maintenance precipitation and sensor malfunction were corrected during data processing latent heat flux was also corrected for water vapor density effects according to webb et al 1980 the data considered as outliers or spikes were also removed the 30 min data were totaled to obtain daily values 24 hr from midnight to midnight daily le was determined using eq 2 and then converted to et using Œª 2 45 mj kg and density of water 1000 kg m¬≥ because of the negligible difference over the expected range of temperatures at the study site Œª was assumed constant the et was measured only at willie s due to the limitations of the ec technique which requires adequate fetch distance a large area 2 2 4 reference evapotranspiration actual et was not measured for the leyendecker alfalfa field instead a reference et and a crop coefficient et etsz x kc were used to determine actual et the etsz was determined using the american society of civil engineers asce standardized equation for short crop or grass asce ewri 2005 climate data were obtained from the leyendecker iii weather station the station measured solar radiation wind speed and direction relative humidity and air temperature the data were collected every minute and averaged to an hourly and daily time step then stored on a cr1000 datalogger csi logan utah for later download and processing the station was powered by a 12 vdc battery and a 20 watt solar panel 2 2 5 change in soil moisture storage change in soil moisture storage Œ¥s was determined as 5 Œ¥ s i 1 n Œ∏ 2 Œ∏ 1 i Œ¥ d i where n is the number of layers to the depth of the effective root zone Œ∏1 and Œ∏2 are the volumetric moisture contents on the first and second time of sampling respectively in m¬≥ m¬≥ Œ¥di is the thickness of each soil layer in mm volumetric soil water content vwc at each field was measured using six sc650 water content reflectometer csi logan utah the sensors were installed in a soil profile near the center of the field in the vicinity where et and depth to groundwater were measured at incremental depths of 30 cm from the ground surface to 180 cm the data were collected every minute and averaged every 30 min onboard a cr300 datalogger csi logan utah daily soil moisture values were determined as a mean of the 30 minute data collected during 24 h from midnight to midnight 2 3 depth to groundwater the depths to groundwater at the three fields were monitored using 50 8 mm diameter galvanized piezometers the piezometer at willie s was 8 5 m long reaching a maximum depth of 7 4 m below the surface and screened at the bottom 2 4 m leyendecker and horse farm s piezometers were 7 62 m long reaching a maximum depth of 6 5 m below the surface and screened at the bottom 1 5 m piezometers at all sites were installed with pressure transducers model cs450 and connected to a cr300 datalogger both csi logan utah to monitor depths to groundwater every 30 min depth to groundwater at all sites was also monitored using a water level sounder during field visits for redundancy the 30 minute data were averaged to 24 h from midnight to midnight for determining daily depths to groundwater 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation farm managers irrigated the fields based on their judgment of soil moisture visual health of the crop and experience aimed to produce a quality alfalfa crop this was the case for all the fields willie s field was irrigated using both surface water and groundwater groundwater was used only when no surface water was available flow measured by the st flume averaged 0 52 m¬≥ s while that measured by the current meter using the usgs velocity area method averaged 0 51 m¬≥ s during an irrigation event the two measurements compared reasonably well with near identical volumetric flow rates difference of 0 01 m¬≥ s the flows in the canal at willie s were low during irrigation periods consisting of groundwater due to pump capacity when compared to irrigations using surface water the flows using groundwater ranged from 0 12 to 0 16 m¬≥ s the amount of water for each irrigation event varied from 134 mm to 222 mm the total depth of 6 irrigation events from groundwater during the season was 994 mm and from 5 irrigation events using surface water was 880 mm irrigation from both sources totaled 1874 mm during the entire growing season willie s water balance for 2017 is presented in table 3 the complete water balance for 2017 can be found in tables 4 and 5 for the horse farm and leyendecker respectively the total depth of irrigation water pumped at horse farm was 1595 mm for 8 irrigation events table 4 and leyendecker was 1419 mm for 10 irrigation events table 5 3 2 rainfall annual precipitation measured at the leyendecker iii weather station was 279 mm which was above the annual average of 222 mm reported by malm 1994 the highest percentage of rainfall in the mesilla valley often occurs during the monsoonal rainy season which starts in july and extends through september malm 1994 of the 279 mm 196 mm 70 22 occurred in july and august table 6 precipitation is very low during the early part of the growing season from february through june and during the non growing season from october through december irrigation is crucial during this time in order to sustain healthy plant growth and to leach out salts that accumulated during the previous season precipitation in 2017 was less than 12 mm per month from february through june and from october through december 3 3 evapotranspiration latent heat was measured directly using licor 7500 from may to august as a check for energy budget closure the energy closure le h rn g on daily basis using le measured by licor 7500 and csat3 ranged from 0 67 to 1 31 with a mean of 0 96 a standard deviation of 0 138 and standard error of 0 0140 for n 97 days table 7 using anova a significance of energy closure among may to august was judged at p 0 05 indicated a significant difference between the months to estimate the entire growing season recharge n 269 days le was determined as a residual in eq 2 assuming the energy budget closure of 1 le in the equivalent depth of water or et measured at willie s was 1309 mm for a total of 269 days during the period of soil moisture measurements table 3 total etsz calculated using the leyendecker iii weather station for the same number of days was 1387 mm fig 2 shows the daily fluctuations of measured et and etsz as well as the cutting periods evapotranspiration of alfalfa decreased during the six harvesting periods and it took between 10 and 16 days average of 12 days after harvesting to reach maturity and transpire at its potential et the difference in etsz and measured et during the harvesting periods ranged from 19 mm to 47 mm with an average of 27 mm per harvest table 8 evapotranspiration of horse farm and leyendecker were not measured but were estimated based on the measurements conducted at willie s the et of horse farm was assumed the same as that at willie s because of the following alfalfa at horse farm was planted early in 2017 and quickly became lush as the season progressed similar to willie s the soil textures within 120 cm depth at horse farm were similar to willie s table 2 and this is also reflected in measured soil moisture as shown in figs 3 and 4 the irrigation scheduling and alfalfa cuttings were in synchrony with willie s the climate at horse farm was similar to that of willie s as the distance between the farms is relatively small and there were no abstractions of wind at both locations data from another climate station near the horse farm lat long 32 16 44 64 n 106 46 15 80 w elevation 1187 m amsl known as fabian garcia fg station was used as a comparison to leyendecker iii climate station i e near willie s daily etsz determined from the data collected at the two stations were compared using linear regression the two sites daily etsz were highly correlated etsz lyiii 0 9512 fg 0 0774 r2 0 9739 standard error of estimate of y with respect to x of 0 32 mm it can be concluded from these similarities that the actual et of horse farm is similar to et measured at willie s as 1116 mm for 228 days table 4 during the growing season evapotranspiration of alfalfa mixed with saltgrass and some bristle grass at the leyendecker field was determined as a weighted average of et of dense alfalfa similar to willie s alfalfa field and et of saltgrass actual et measurements at willie s was used as et for the 50 alfalfa in leyendecker the et of 50 grass portion was determined from etsz and a crop coefficient of grass the et portion of riparian grass was determined by using a polynomial crop coefficient as a function of the day of the year doy developed by bawazir et al 2014 for saltgrass multiplied by etsz et kcsaltgrass x etsz saltgrass is native to new mexico and grows in the mesilla valley alluvial deposits of the rio grande the et of saltgrass was used to represent et of all the grass types in the leyendecker farm since the percentage of other types of grasses was very low the et of leyendecker farm was determined as 964 mm for 274 days table 5 3 4 change in soil moisture storage change in soil moisture storage was determined from measurements of soil moisture within the root zones change in storage is most impactful in the root zone below the root zone is considered a zero flux plane separating upward movement of water in soil due to et from water draining downward to groundwater due to gravity arnold 2011 we considered the zero flux plane at 120 cm below the surface for calculations of the change in soil moisture storage the effect of et would be very low below 120 cm since no roots were observed while excavating at the three study fields a similar zero flux plane of 120 cm in alfalfa fields was reported by arnold 2011 additional vwc sensors were installed below the 120 cm root zone at 150 cm and 180 cm during irrigation events these two additional sensors measured the vwc average of approximately 13 and 6 respectively showing water was percolating past the root zone capillary rise from groundwater water was not observed in the soil moisture measurements conducted at 150 cm and 180 cm daily soil moisture measurements are shown in figs 3 through 5 and the changes in soil moisture storage were calculated using eq 4 spikes in soil vwc occurred during irrigation events and heavy rains e g fig 3 high vwc from heavy monsoonal rains table 6 can be seen in figs 3 through 5 on days 196 236 of the year at leyendecker the sensor at 90 cm depth malfunctioned and therefore reported erroneous data instead data measured at 60 cm and 120 cm were weighted based on their incremental depths to determine daily vwc at 75 cm as shown in fig 5 the volumetric moisture content at leyendecker during the first and second irrigations exceeded 60 at 30 cm depth due to water ponding and low infiltration rates of clay soil volumetric soil moisture at willie s and horse farm followed a similar trend figs 3 and 4 this is expected due to similarities in soil texture and drainage properties the daily 24 h changes in soil moisture storage were summed for the periods between irrigation events to determine deep percolation tables 3 through 5 the changes in soil moisture storage at willie s horse farm and leyendecker during the growing season totaled to 107 mm 5 mm and 69 mm respectively 3 5 groundwater recharge the irrigation frequency and amounts varied among the fields water applied during each irrigation was consistently lower at leyendecker when compared to willie s and horse farm based on the total irrigation of water applied during the growing season and the number of irrigation events the horse farm received more water than willie s and leyendecker on average the actual et of leyendecker was low 963 mm due to the mixture of grasses with alfalfa and high matric potential of clay soils depth to groundwater was greater than 3 25 m at all the study sites fig 6 no water was detected in the 6 5 m depth piezometer at the horse farm and therefore depth to groundwater was considered more than 6 5 m groundwater at all the study sites was too deep to contribute water to the root zone by capillarity negative values in recharge are possibly due to matric potential pulling water into the root zone from the soil below it or lateral flow of water within the soil strata the rise in groundwater elevation during the study period coincided with releases of water i e flow in the rio grande fig 6 depth to groundwater at leyendecker responded faster to high flow in the rio grande than at willie s due to its proximity to the river the rio grande is hydrologically connected to the groundwater as described by wilson et al 1981 when water is released in the river and is distributed to the farmers in the mesilla valley for irrigation most farmers stop pumping groundwater for irrigation during this period groundwater elevation increased at both willie s and leyendecker due to the combination of a decrease in groundwater pumping seepage from the river and irrigation ditches and infiltration from increased surface water irrigation in the valley groundwater recharge was determined using the water balance method eq 1 recharge during the growing season was 690 mm at willie s 716 mm at horse farm and 618 mm at leyendecker statistical analysis using an analysis of variance anova test was performed using recharge results to determine if there are any statistical differences among the three study sites the anova test yielded an f ratio of 0 8876 with a p value of 0 42 indicating the recharge at the three sites is not significantly different at p 0 05 therefore no further analyses were performed the similar recharge amounts are likely due to farming irrigation practices farmers adjust irrigation amounts based on field conditions such as soil type or crop water needs percent recharge determined as total recharge divided by total irrigation ranged between 36 82 and 44 89 table 9 these values are comparable to a recharge ratio of 47 during a growing season reported by ochoa et al 2012 for a flood irrigated alfalfa field in northern new mexico using the wbm a similar percentage recharge range of 31 38 was reported by gutierrez jurado et al 2017 for flood irrigated alfalfa in northern new mexico arnold 2011 found a percentage recharge range of 40 52 in weld county colorado for flood irrigated alfalfa using the wbm on farm irrigation efficiency et effective prec ir x 100 for willie s horse farm and leyendecker was determined as 59 93 58 31 and 54 83 respectively effective precipitation was determined as 80 of rainfall martin and gilley 1993 similar on farm irrigation efficiency of 60 for flood irrigated fields within ebid was reported by new mexico s office of state engineer by wilson et al 2003 measurement of et using an ec system requires special expertise and expensive equipment however climate data are readily available in most areas utilizing nearby climate data to calculate asce standardized etsz could be used for recharge estimates in alfalfa fields in the mesilla valley or similar areas as observed in this study growing season etsz was 1429 mm for 281 days compared to measured alfalfa et of 1336 mm for the same number of days a difference of only 93 mm recharge estimates based on etsz without consideration of et reduction due to harvesting periods would underestimate recharge for willie s field by 11 however by considering 27 mm of average et reduction per cut for 6 cuts during the season table 8 recharge would be overestimated by only 6 water management agencies and farmers can use etsz with readily available climate data and taking into account the decline of et average et reduction of 27 mm during harvesting periods to better estimate et of alfalfa and recharge an average et reduction of 27 mm per harvest is a simple way to adjust etsz which takes into consideration the number of alfalfa harvests which vary with season and farming practices we acknowledge that this reduction may not be the same in other regions as alfalfa plants may develop differently and may need some adjustment further studies are warranted other methods such as remote sensing based crop coefficient which use time series of high resolution images data could be used to estimate et of alfalfa or other crops consoli and vanella 2014 consoli et al 2016 4 conclusion recharge was determined as a residual in the wbm for three alfalfa fields of different sizes crop ages and soil textures the et parameter in the wbm was measured at willie s large field using eddy covariance energy budget method rather than estimated from climate stations to determine groundwater recharge similar et was estimated at horse farm based on the climate soil characteristics and plant vigor et at leyendecker was estimated using a weighted average of alfalfa et measured at willies climate data and crop coefficient of grass the other parameters of the wbm applied irrigation soil moisture and rainfall were also measured at each field when applying et referenced to grass etsz instead of actual et in the wbm equation the recharge in willie s field is underestimated by 11 if an average of 27 mm reduction in etsz per cut is considered the recharge is overestimated by 6 farmers and water managers could consider an average of 27 mm reduction in etsz per cut to better estimate et of alfalfa and groundwater recharge in the wbm assuming alfalfa fields have a similar crop development during the growing season of 2017 36 82 44 89 of the irrigation amount contributed to recharge on farm irrigation efficiency ranged from 54 83 to 59 93 based on farming irrigation practices these seemingly high recharge amounts are not necessarily a loss but rather beneficial for leaching excess salts from the root zone and recharging groundwater an anova test determined no statistical differences between the recharge of the three alfalfa fields f ratio of 0 8876 with a p value of 0 42 also no significant differences in recharge amounts were observed due to varying field sizes crop ages and soil textures this study emphasized the importance of calculating recharge in flood irrigated fields of arid regions particularly the mesilla valley however to

10334,quantifying groundwater recharge from irrigation practices of arid regions is necessary for efficient and sustainable groundwater resources management recharge is difficult to measure directly many studies have quantified recharge from agricultural fields as a residual of the soil water balance method wbm or by other mathematical models estimating evapotranspiration et and measuring soil moisture rainfall and irrigation et is often estimated using weather parameters from climate stations that are distant from crops flooding of fields is the most common form of irrigation used by farmers in the mesilla valley new mexico to grow alfalfa one of the state s major crops the objectives of this study were to quantify recharge in flood irrigated alfalfa fields in the mesilla valley new mexico using the wbm and actual et measurements during the 2017 growing season the study fields were different sizes crop ages and soil textures actual et of alfalfa was measured on the largest field using the eddy covariance energy budget method and applied to the two other nearby fields as estimated et all other wbm parameters were measured at each study site i e soil moisture rainfall and applied irrigation recharge using et referenced to grass etsz was then calculated using weather parameters and compared with measured et recharge ranged from 618 to 716 mm with no significant statistical differences between the three alfalfa fields f ratio of 0 8876 and a p value of 0 42 using anova recharge to irrigation ratio ranged from 37 to 45 on farm irrigation efficiency ranged from 54 86 to 59 94 when compared to measured et etsz underestimated recharge of alfalfa by 11 in the wbm and overestimated recharge by 6 when a reduction in etsz during harvest periods are considered the results show that the measurement of actual et improved recharge estimates in the alfalfa fields keywords flood irrigation groundwater deep percolation soil moisture eddy covariance 1 introduction irrigated river valleys of the western u s and arid regions worldwide are facing water shortages brought on by many factors such as prolonged drought competing water uses from municipal and industrial users and changing agricultural land use and cropping patterns that use more water per unit of land farmers and water managers need tools to more accurately quantify water budgets and enable better water management for the viability of irrigated agriculture better information is needed to characterize the interactions between surface water and groundwater that are so important in irrigated river valleys recharge to groundwater from surface water irrigation is particularly important for the longevity of the groundwater resource in dry regions the mesilla valley along the rio grande river in south central new mexico is emblematic of an arid region irrigated river valley with stressed groundwater and recharge from irrigation the hydrogeology of the valley is such that the surface water i e the rio grande is connected to the shallow flood plain alluvium aquifer wilson et al 1981 according to conover 1954 the average recharge from precipitation infiltration is small the groundwater in the valley is recharged from seepage in certain stretches of the river and canals infiltration from irrigation groundwater flow from mesas and other elevated areas and precipitation in the floodplain conover 1954 flooding is the most common irrigation practice although sprinkler and underground drip irrigation methods are recently being introduced by some farmers usda 2018 however deep percolation beneath flood irrigated fields is not well understood and is difficult to measure directly bethune et al 2008 arnold 2011 ochoa et al 2012 alfalfa is an economically important crop in new mexico that is commonly flood irrigated usda 2018 lauriault et al 2017 in 2017 the state reported a harvest of nearly 77 000 ha of alfalfa hay valued at 171 000 000 us dollars in the mesilla valley alfalfa ranks second by area behind pecans usda 2018 as the demand for groundwater increases in the region due to prolonged drought quantifying groundwater recharge through deep percolation from flood irrigation is necessary for efficient and sustainable groundwater resources management quantifying groundwater recharge deep percolation of flood irrigation is important for water management in arid regions several techniques to quantify groundwater recharge have been described by scanlon et al 2002 a simple and commonly used method is the water balance method wbm the wbm has been used to estimate deep percolation below the plant root zone scanlon et al 2002 arnold 2011 ochoa et al 2012 gutierrez jurado et al 2017 and the results have been used to calibrate and check other deep percolation models and methods deb et al 2012 as mentioned by scanlon et al 2002 however the limitations of estimating recharge as a residual in the wbm depend on the accuracy with which the components of the budget are measured a major limitation is the actual measurement of evapotranspiration et actual measurements of et using methods such as eddy covariance bowen ratio and others rely on expensive sensors and equipment additionally they require special expertise experience and large fields for adequate fetch distance rosenberg et al 1983 jensen et al 1990 brutsaert et al 2005 studies in a similar climate to the mesilla valley that incorporated the wbm estimated et indirectly from climate data e g ochoa et al 2012 gutierrez jurado et al 2017 estimation of et from climate data however is prone to errors due to the quality of climate data the proximity of climate stations with respect to the fields and the harvesting periods of crops e g cutting of alfalfa is often ignored the objective of this study was to quantify the recharge considered as deep percolation past the plant root zone of groundwater from three flood irrigated fields of alfalfa crop medicago sativa l using measured soil moisture precipitation amount of irrigation applied and actual measured et i e where measurements are possible in the wbm 2 materials and methods 2 1 site descriptions the mesilla valley is part of the rio grande flood plain in south central new mexico it extends from leasburg dam at radium springs new mexico to the west side of el paso texas near international dam a distance of about 96 km it includes about 36 400 ha of bottom valley land where agriculture has been active for centuries conover 1954 due to fertile soil and availability of good irrigation water from the rio grande and groundwater the flow of the rio grande in the valley has been channeled its flow is controlled by the releases of water from caballo reservoir approximately 72 km north of the mesilla valley farmers in the mesilla valley often pump groundwater from their wells to supplement surface water to meet the crop irrigation needs during the water scarce periods wozniak 1998 this study was performed on three alfalfa fields referred to as horse farm leyendecker and willie s fig 1 new mexico state university nmsu owns and manages the alfalfa fields in the horse farm and the leyendecker plant science research center whereas willie s is privately owned the horse farm and leyendecker fields were about 2 ha each and willie s was the largest among the three fields with an area of 35 2 ha the horse farm was about 5 km from the rio grande whereas leyendecker and willies were located within a kilometer of river table 1 alfalfa of the horse farm was the youngest it was seeded in march 2017 willie s and leyendecker alfalfa were seeded in 2014 and 2013 respectively the horse farm and willie s alfalfa fields were dense uniform and monotypic in contrast the leyendecker field was composed of 50 alfalfa and 50 native grasses including saltgrass distichlis spicata var stricta l and yellow bristle grass setaria pumila 2 1 1 climate the climate of the region is described by malm 1994 as an arid southwestern united states climate with annual average precipitation of 222 mm per year more than 75 of the precipitation falls during the warm monsoonal months of july through september the mean annual temperature based on a 108 year climate record of the city of las cruces is 15 8 c and an average diurnal temperature of 17 8 c malm 1994 winds are usually light during summer months and moderately strong with occasional gusts in spring and winter 2 1 2 geology and soil texture the mesilla valley is dominated by sediments largely derived from alluvial and fluvial process and are composed of mainly gravel sand silt and some clay hawley et al 2001 the us department of agriculture usda natural resources conservation service nrcs web soil survey usda nrcs wss shows that the surface soil of willie s field is mainly silty loam and leyendecker and horse farm fields are clay loam a total of 18 soil samples 3 samples at each depth for subsurface textural analysis were collected at the center of each study site during the installation of the soil moisture profile sampling was conducted in 30 cm increments from the surface to 180 cm depth a hydrometer method test was performed on soil samples to determine their respective textures at each depth table 2 following astm 2017 international standard for hydrometer testing willie s leyendecker and horse farm s surface soil to 30 cm depth were determined as silt loam clay and clay loam respectively the tilling and mixing of the soils on these fields have changed the soil texture over time but in general our assessment of the topsoil texture is similar to those reported by the usda nrcs wss the textures of soil samples taken at different depths 30 180 cm for the three fields range from fine to coarse texture two horizons of soils were visible during the installation of groundwater monitoring wells at all of the fields generally the top 0 90 cm was fine textured soils and 90 610 cm was coarse sandy textured soils 2 2 groundwater recharge groundwater recharge dw is considered here as deep percolation beneath the crop root zone it is determined as a residual in the soil water balance equation eq 1 as 1 d w i r r e Œ¥s et where ir is the amount of irrigation in mm applied during the period re is the amount of rainfall in mm that does not run off the area during the period et is the amount of evapotranspiration in mm during the period and Œ¥s is the change in soil water storage in mm over the period there was no runoff of irrigation water leaving the fields since all fields were laser leveled and bordered the effects of groundwater contribution to the plant root zone as a source of water for plants were not considered since the groundwater was deep 3 25 m at all the experiment sites field observation during excavation at the three farms showed alfalfa roots extending to a maximum of 1 2 m deep eq 1 characterized the soil water status within the plant root zone of 120 cm and dw below 120 cm assuming i soil water content within the 120 cm profile varied in one dimensional vertical direction ii surface to 160 cm depth soil textures are homogenous throughout the field iii capillary rise was negligible since the groundwater table was too deep iv the Œ¥s measurements represented the entire alfalfa field and v deep percolation is assumed to eventually reach groundwater 2 2 1 irrigation the fields were irrigated by flooding using pumped groundwater and or surface water from the rio grande surface water in the mesilla valley is managed and supplied to farmers by the local irrigation district using a network of irrigation canals all the fields were laser leveled and bordered before planting alfalfa at willie s alfalfa was irrigated using groundwater irrigation pump and by surface water when available the irrigation water from the well or surface water was conveyed by a concrete lined trapezoidal canal to the field the canal was 0 61 m at the base 2 13 m at the crest and 0 91 m deep flow in the canal was measured using a simple trapezoidal flume st flume with a circular stilling well as described by samani 2017 the depth of water in the stilling well was measured using a pressure transducer model cs450 and a cr200 datalogger both from campbell scientific inc csi logan utah flow measured by the flume was verified using a current velocity meter model 2100 swoffer instruments inc federal way washington following the usgs velocity area method turnipseed and sauer 2010 accuracy of most discharge measurements considered qualitatively a good measurement is about 5 turnipseed and sauer 2010 the error of the current meter used in this study when appropriately calibrated is about 1 swoffer instruments inc manual federal way washington groundwater at willie s was pumped from the ground through a metered pipe where the total volume of water discharged was monitored every irrigation the water from the well was discharged in the same canal which was also used for surface water irrigation to deliver water to the field irrigation infrastructures at horse farm and leyendecker were connected to a groundwater well and a pump leyendecker had the capability of pumping surface water through the same system which conveyed groundwater allowing both surface water pumped from a canal and groundwater to be measured during each irrigation the amount of water pumped from each of the wells at horse farm and leyendecker were monitored by a meter that was mounted in their respective discharge pipes the meters were manually read before and after irrigations to determine the total volume of water pumped the volume of water applied to the fields was divided by the irrigated land area to determine the depth in mm of irrigation water applied 2 2 2 rainfall precipitation in the mesilla valley is mostly in the form of rain rainfall was measured by a climate station known as leyendecker iii weather station 32 12 3 26 n 106 44 34 00 w elevation 1176 m amsl located inside the nmsu leyendecker plant science research center and near the leyendecker alfalfa field the station is located about 0 62 km from willie s and 8 2 km from the horse farm rainfall was measured using a tb4 rain gage csi logan utah the tb4 rain gage has a 203 2 mm orifice and measures rainfall in 0 254 mm increments using an internal siphon and a typing bucket mechanism 2 2 3 actual evapotranspiration evapotranspiration was measured using the energy budget method eq 2 at willie s in the center of the field to ensure adequate fetch the soil moisture profile and depth to groundwater were also measured alongside the et the location of the eddy covariance ec system is denoted by the symbol x in fig 1 the components of the energy budget including net radiation soil heat and sensible heat fluxes are measured and latent heat is determined as a residual following the methodology presented in bawazir et al 2014 latent heat flux le is converted to an equivalent depth of water or et in mm by dividing latent heat flux by latent heat of vaporization of water i e 2 45 mj kg at normal temperatures and density of water 1000 kg m¬≥ 2 l e r n g h where le is latent heat rn is net radiation g is soil heat and h is sensible heat all these energy fluxes are measured in w m2 sensible heat is measured using the eddy covariance technique swinbank 1951 rosenberg et al 1983 brutsaert et al 2005 where vertical wind speed and air temperature in the lower atmospheric boundary layer are correlated eq 3 3 h p c p w t where p is the mean density of air cp is the air heat capacity at constant pressure and w t is the covariance between fluctuations of vertical wind speed w and temperature t the instrumentation used in measuring the components of the energy budget in eq 2 included three dimensional sonic anemometer model csat3 csi logan utah to measure sensible heat net radiometer model nr lite csi logan utah to measure net radiation two soil heat flux plates model hft3 rebs inc csi in combination with soil moisture sensor model cs 616 csi logan utah and a pair of two averaging soil temperature thermocouples model cav csi logan utah to measure soil heat flux additional sensors were installed to measure relative humidity and ambient air temperature model hmp45c csi logan utah csat3 and hmp45c were mounted on a tripod at 2 5 m above the ground in the middle of willie s field the csat3 was leveled and oriented towards prevailing wind with an adequate fetch distance of more than 250 m in each direction an effort was made to minimize potential errors due to sensor mounting and measurement in the field to check for energy budget closure of eq 2 open path licor 7500 li cor biosciences lincoln nebraska coupled with csat3 was used to measure le following burba and anderson 2005 4 l e Œª w q where Œª is the latent heat of vaporization of water and w q is the covariance between the fluctuation of vertical wind speed w and vapor density q a net radiometer was mounted on a separate pole nearby at a height of 1 94 m from the ground surface the two soil heat flux plates were installed at 8 cm below the ground surface and separated by about a meter the plates were installed in such a way that they capture heat flux underneath the plants and in open spaces that would be exposed to sunlight during alfalfa cutting periods the pair of averaging soil temperature sensors were then installed at 2 cm and 6 cm below the ground and above the soil heat flux plates the soil moisture sensor was installed at a 45 degree angle to measure soil moisture in the upper soil layer for use in determining the rate of soil heat storage as part of soil heat flux calculations data were collected at 10 hz using cr5000 datalogger csi logan utah and averaged every 30 min the entire setup i e system was powered by a battery and solar panels the footprint of ec measurements at the site was determined using scaling procedure following kljun et al 2004 the footprint ranged from 2 m to 234 m with an average of 37 m for 30 min data n 13 378 at 90 of the scaled footprint from the ec sensor or receptor the minimum distance to the edge of the field from the ec sensors was 230 m and located in the north eastern quadrant where the prevailing wind was minimum the distance to the edge of the field for the rest of the quadrants was at least 274 m 234 m and therefore satisfying the required footprint of et measurements by the ec technique measurement of fluxes such as le and sensible heat h using the ec measurement technique have to be corrected due to assumptions in the methodology instrumentation problems physical phenomena and terrain burba and anderson 2005 aubinet et al 2012 data collected by csat3 were corrected for sonic temperature massman and lee 2002 frequency attenuation massman 2000 2001 and cross contamination using a double rotation scheme tanner and thurtell 1969 lee et al 2004 errors attributed to regular maintenance precipitation and sensor malfunction were corrected during data processing latent heat flux was also corrected for water vapor density effects according to webb et al 1980 the data considered as outliers or spikes were also removed the 30 min data were totaled to obtain daily values 24 hr from midnight to midnight daily le was determined using eq 2 and then converted to et using Œª 2 45 mj kg and density of water 1000 kg m¬≥ because of the negligible difference over the expected range of temperatures at the study site Œª was assumed constant the et was measured only at willie s due to the limitations of the ec technique which requires adequate fetch distance a large area 2 2 4 reference evapotranspiration actual et was not measured for the leyendecker alfalfa field instead a reference et and a crop coefficient et etsz x kc were used to determine actual et the etsz was determined using the american society of civil engineers asce standardized equation for short crop or grass asce ewri 2005 climate data were obtained from the leyendecker iii weather station the station measured solar radiation wind speed and direction relative humidity and air temperature the data were collected every minute and averaged to an hourly and daily time step then stored on a cr1000 datalogger csi logan utah for later download and processing the station was powered by a 12 vdc battery and a 20 watt solar panel 2 2 5 change in soil moisture storage change in soil moisture storage Œ¥s was determined as 5 Œ¥ s i 1 n Œ∏ 2 Œ∏ 1 i Œ¥ d i where n is the number of layers to the depth of the effective root zone Œ∏1 and Œ∏2 are the volumetric moisture contents on the first and second time of sampling respectively in m¬≥ m¬≥ Œ¥di is the thickness of each soil layer in mm volumetric soil water content vwc at each field was measured using six sc650 water content reflectometer csi logan utah the sensors were installed in a soil profile near the center of the field in the vicinity where et and depth to groundwater were measured at incremental depths of 30 cm from the ground surface to 180 cm the data were collected every minute and averaged every 30 min onboard a cr300 datalogger csi logan utah daily soil moisture values were determined as a mean of the 30 minute data collected during 24 h from midnight to midnight 2 3 depth to groundwater the depths to groundwater at the three fields were monitored using 50 8 mm diameter galvanized piezometers the piezometer at willie s was 8 5 m long reaching a maximum depth of 7 4 m below the surface and screened at the bottom 2 4 m leyendecker and horse farm s piezometers were 7 62 m long reaching a maximum depth of 6 5 m below the surface and screened at the bottom 1 5 m piezometers at all sites were installed with pressure transducers model cs450 and connected to a cr300 datalogger both csi logan utah to monitor depths to groundwater every 30 min depth to groundwater at all sites was also monitored using a water level sounder during field visits for redundancy the 30 minute data were averaged to 24 h from midnight to midnight for determining daily depths to groundwater 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation farm managers irrigated the fields based on their judgment of soil moisture visual health of the crop and experience aimed to produce a quality alfalfa crop this was the case for all the fields willie s field was irrigated using both surface water and groundwater groundwater was used only when no surface water was available flow measured by the st flume averaged 0 52 m¬≥ s while that measured by the current meter using the usgs velocity area method averaged 0 51 m¬≥ s during an irrigation event the two measurements compared reasonably well with near identical volumetric flow rates difference of 0 01 m¬≥ s the flows in the canal at willie s were low during irrigation periods consisting of groundwater due to pump capacity when compared to irrigations using surface water the flows using groundwater ranged from 0 12 to 0 16 m¬≥ s the amount of water for each irrigation event varied from 134 mm to 222 mm the total depth of 6 irrigation events from groundwater during the season was 994 mm and from 5 irrigation events using surface water was 880 mm irrigation from both sources totaled 1874 mm during the entire growing season willie s water balance for 2017 is presented in table 3 the complete water balance for 2017 can be found in tables 4 and 5 for the horse farm and leyendecker respectively the total depth of irrigation water pumped at horse farm was 1595 mm for 8 irrigation events table 4 and leyendecker was 1419 mm for 10 irrigation events table 5 3 2 rainfall annual precipitation measured at the leyendecker iii weather station was 279 mm which was above the annual average of 222 mm reported by malm 1994 the highest percentage of rainfall in the mesilla valley often occurs during the monsoonal rainy season which starts in july and extends through september malm 1994 of the 279 mm 196 mm 70 22 occurred in july and august table 6 precipitation is very low during the early part of the growing season from february through june and during the non growing season from october through december irrigation is crucial during this time in order to sustain healthy plant growth and to leach out salts that accumulated during the previous season precipitation in 2017 was less than 12 mm per month from february through june and from october through december 3 3 evapotranspiration latent heat was measured directly using licor 7500 from may to august as a check for energy budget closure the energy closure le h rn g on daily basis using le measured by licor 7500 and csat3 ranged from 0 67 to 1 31 with a mean of 0 96 a standard deviation of 0 138 and standard error of 0 0140 for n 97 days table 7 using anova a significance of energy closure among may to august was judged at p 0 05 indicated a significant difference between the months to estimate the entire growing season recharge n 269 days le was determined as a residual in eq 2 assuming the energy budget closure of 1 le in the equivalent depth of water or et measured at willie s was 1309 mm for a total of 269 days during the period of soil moisture measurements table 3 total etsz calculated using the leyendecker iii weather station for the same number of days was 1387 mm fig 2 shows the daily fluctuations of measured et and etsz as well as the cutting periods evapotranspiration of alfalfa decreased during the six harvesting periods and it took between 10 and 16 days average of 12 days after harvesting to reach maturity and transpire at its potential et the difference in etsz and measured et during the harvesting periods ranged from 19 mm to 47 mm with an average of 27 mm per harvest table 8 evapotranspiration of horse farm and leyendecker were not measured but were estimated based on the measurements conducted at willie s the et of horse farm was assumed the same as that at willie s because of the following alfalfa at horse farm was planted early in 2017 and quickly became lush as the season progressed similar to willie s the soil textures within 120 cm depth at horse farm were similar to willie s table 2 and this is also reflected in measured soil moisture as shown in figs 3 and 4 the irrigation scheduling and alfalfa cuttings were in synchrony with willie s the climate at horse farm was similar to that of willie s as the distance between the farms is relatively small and there were no abstractions of wind at both locations data from another climate station near the horse farm lat long 32 16 44 64 n 106 46 15 80 w elevation 1187 m amsl known as fabian garcia fg station was used as a comparison to leyendecker iii climate station i e near willie s daily etsz determined from the data collected at the two stations were compared using linear regression the two sites daily etsz were highly correlated etsz lyiii 0 9512 fg 0 0774 r2 0 9739 standard error of estimate of y with respect to x of 0 32 mm it can be concluded from these similarities that the actual et of horse farm is similar to et measured at willie s as 1116 mm for 228 days table 4 during the growing season evapotranspiration of alfalfa mixed with saltgrass and some bristle grass at the leyendecker field was determined as a weighted average of et of dense alfalfa similar to willie s alfalfa field and et of saltgrass actual et measurements at willie s was used as et for the 50 alfalfa in leyendecker the et of 50 grass portion was determined from etsz and a crop coefficient of grass the et portion of riparian grass was determined by using a polynomial crop coefficient as a function of the day of the year doy developed by bawazir et al 2014 for saltgrass multiplied by etsz et kcsaltgrass x etsz saltgrass is native to new mexico and grows in the mesilla valley alluvial deposits of the rio grande the et of saltgrass was used to represent et of all the grass types in the leyendecker farm since the percentage of other types of grasses was very low the et of leyendecker farm was determined as 964 mm for 274 days table 5 3 4 change in soil moisture storage change in soil moisture storage was determined from measurements of soil moisture within the root zones change in storage is most impactful in the root zone below the root zone is considered a zero flux plane separating upward movement of water in soil due to et from water draining downward to groundwater due to gravity arnold 2011 we considered the zero flux plane at 120 cm below the surface for calculations of the change in soil moisture storage the effect of et would be very low below 120 cm since no roots were observed while excavating at the three study fields a similar zero flux plane of 120 cm in alfalfa fields was reported by arnold 2011 additional vwc sensors were installed below the 120 cm root zone at 150 cm and 180 cm during irrigation events these two additional sensors measured the vwc average of approximately 13 and 6 respectively showing water was percolating past the root zone capillary rise from groundwater water was not observed in the soil moisture measurements conducted at 150 cm and 180 cm daily soil moisture measurements are shown in figs 3 through 5 and the changes in soil moisture storage were calculated using eq 4 spikes in soil vwc occurred during irrigation events and heavy rains e g fig 3 high vwc from heavy monsoonal rains table 6 can be seen in figs 3 through 5 on days 196 236 of the year at leyendecker the sensor at 90 cm depth malfunctioned and therefore reported erroneous data instead data measured at 60 cm and 120 cm were weighted based on their incremental depths to determine daily vwc at 75 cm as shown in fig 5 the volumetric moisture content at leyendecker during the first and second irrigations exceeded 60 at 30 cm depth due to water ponding and low infiltration rates of clay soil volumetric soil moisture at willie s and horse farm followed a similar trend figs 3 and 4 this is expected due to similarities in soil texture and drainage properties the daily 24 h changes in soil moisture storage were summed for the periods between irrigation events to determine deep percolation tables 3 through 5 the changes in soil moisture storage at willie s horse farm and leyendecker during the growing season totaled to 107 mm 5 mm and 69 mm respectively 3 5 groundwater recharge the irrigation frequency and amounts varied among the fields water applied during each irrigation was consistently lower at leyendecker when compared to willie s and horse farm based on the total irrigation of water applied during the growing season and the number of irrigation events the horse farm received more water than willie s and leyendecker on average the actual et of leyendecker was low 963 mm due to the mixture of grasses with alfalfa and high matric potential of clay soils depth to groundwater was greater than 3 25 m at all the study sites fig 6 no water was detected in the 6 5 m depth piezometer at the horse farm and therefore depth to groundwater was considered more than 6 5 m groundwater at all the study sites was too deep to contribute water to the root zone by capillarity negative values in recharge are possibly due to matric potential pulling water into the root zone from the soil below it or lateral flow of water within the soil strata the rise in groundwater elevation during the study period coincided with releases of water i e flow in the rio grande fig 6 depth to groundwater at leyendecker responded faster to high flow in the rio grande than at willie s due to its proximity to the river the rio grande is hydrologically connected to the groundwater as described by wilson et al 1981 when water is released in the river and is distributed to the farmers in the mesilla valley for irrigation most farmers stop pumping groundwater for irrigation during this period groundwater elevation increased at both willie s and leyendecker due to the combination of a decrease in groundwater pumping seepage from the river and irrigation ditches and infiltration from increased surface water irrigation in the valley groundwater recharge was determined using the water balance method eq 1 recharge during the growing season was 690 mm at willie s 716 mm at horse farm and 618 mm at leyendecker statistical analysis using an analysis of variance anova test was performed using recharge results to determine if there are any statistical differences among the three study sites the anova test yielded an f ratio of 0 8876 with a p value of 0 42 indicating the recharge at the three sites is not significantly different at p 0 05 therefore no further analyses were performed the similar recharge amounts are likely due to farming irrigation practices farmers adjust irrigation amounts based on field conditions such as soil type or crop water needs percent recharge determined as total recharge divided by total irrigation ranged between 36 82 and 44 89 table 9 these values are comparable to a recharge ratio of 47 during a growing season reported by ochoa et al 2012 for a flood irrigated alfalfa field in northern new mexico using the wbm a similar percentage recharge range of 31 38 was reported by gutierrez jurado et al 2017 for flood irrigated alfalfa in northern new mexico arnold 2011 found a percentage recharge range of 40 52 in weld county colorado for flood irrigated alfalfa using the wbm on farm irrigation efficiency et effective prec ir x 100 for willie s horse farm and leyendecker was determined as 59 93 58 31 and 54 83 respectively effective precipitation was determined as 80 of rainfall martin and gilley 1993 similar on farm irrigation efficiency of 60 for flood irrigated fields within ebid was reported by new mexico s office of state engineer by wilson et al 2003 measurement of et using an ec system requires special expertise and expensive equipment however climate data are readily available in most areas utilizing nearby climate data to calculate asce standardized etsz could be used for recharge estimates in alfalfa fields in the mesilla valley or similar areas as observed in this study growing season etsz was 1429 mm for 281 days compared to measured alfalfa et of 1336 mm for the same number of days a difference of only 93 mm recharge estimates based on etsz without consideration of et reduction due to harvesting periods would underestimate recharge for willie s field by 11 however by considering 27 mm of average et reduction per cut for 6 cuts during the season table 8 recharge would be overestimated by only 6 water management agencies and farmers can use etsz with readily available climate data and taking into account the decline of et average et reduction of 27 mm during harvesting periods to better estimate et of alfalfa and recharge an average et reduction of 27 mm per harvest is a simple way to adjust etsz which takes into consideration the number of alfalfa harvests which vary with season and farming practices we acknowledge that this reduction may not be the same in other regions as alfalfa plants may develop differently and may need some adjustment further studies are warranted other methods such as remote sensing based crop coefficient which use time series of high resolution images data could be used to estimate et of alfalfa or other crops consoli and vanella 2014 consoli et al 2016 4 conclusion recharge was determined as a residual in the wbm for three alfalfa fields of different sizes crop ages and soil textures the et parameter in the wbm was measured at willie s large field using eddy covariance energy budget method rather than estimated from climate stations to determine groundwater recharge similar et was estimated at horse farm based on the climate soil characteristics and plant vigor et at leyendecker was estimated using a weighted average of alfalfa et measured at willies climate data and crop coefficient of grass the other parameters of the wbm applied irrigation soil moisture and rainfall were also measured at each field when applying et referenced to grass etsz instead of actual et in the wbm equation the recharge in willie s field is underestimated by 11 if an average of 27 mm reduction in etsz per cut is considered the recharge is overestimated by 6 farmers and water managers could consider an average of 27 mm reduction in etsz per cut to better estimate et of alfalfa and groundwater recharge in the wbm assuming alfalfa fields have a similar crop development during the growing season of 2017 36 82 44 89 of the irrigation amount contributed to recharge on farm irrigation efficiency ranged from 54 83 to 59 93 based on farming irrigation practices these seemingly high recharge amounts are not necessarily a loss but rather beneficial for leaching excess salts from the root zone and recharging groundwater an anova test determined no statistical differences between the recharge of the three alfalfa fields f ratio of 0 8876 with a p value of 0 42 also no significant differences in recharge amounts were observed due to varying field sizes crop ages and soil textures this study emphasized the importance of calculating recharge in flood irrigated fields of arid regions particularly the mesilla valley however to quantify recharge within the entire mesilla valley other crops would need to be evaluated funding united states geological survey usgs transboundary aquifer assessment program taap cooperative
