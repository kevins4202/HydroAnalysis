16365,amino acids aas are a major group of odorous disinfection by product o dbp precursors o dbps formations during free chlorine disinfection has been previously investigated however knowledge regarding the o dbp formation mechanism and kinetics under chloramination of aas is very limited in this study the generation of odorous isovaleraldehyde isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine from leucine leu a typical and abundant aa in many drinking water sources in its free and combined forms during chloramination under several typical addition schemes of disinfectants was investigated free leu and glycylleucine gly leu were chosen as model compounds since they have been indicated to be o dbp precursors during chlorination intermediate product analysis and kinetics studies were conducted to study the reaction mechanisms impacts of disinfectants dosages and ph were also investigated in experiments and simulations the results indicated that comparing with chlorination chloramination of leu has its uniqueness by participating in reacting with isovaleraldehyde to form n chloroisovaleraldimine and all the three o dbps formations from free leu and gly leu during chloramination with preformed nh2cl were less than those during chlorination indicating that using nh2cl for disinfection ensures control over the off flavor problems to some degree when chloramination was realized by adding chlorine and ammonia separately a longer pre chlorination time led to greater yields of the o dbps from both precursors whereas adding ammonia before chlorine promoted more isovaleraldehyde formation from free leu under alkaline conditions more isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine were produced and acidic conditions led to more isovaleraldehyde formation during chloramination notably o dbps yields from free leu were approximately 1000 times greater than those from gly leu during chloramination under all the schemes in addition chlor am ination experiments with real water from taihu lake the third largest freshwater lake and water source for twenty million people in china indicated the formation of n chloroisovaleraldimine and isovaleraldehyde was highly likely to cause odorous problems in drinking water this study facilitates further understanding of the causes of off flavor issues in drinking water and can help control the odorous problems by optimizing the operating parameters of drinking water treatment plants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords amino acids chloramination o dbps aldehydes nitriles n chloroaldimines 1 introduction although the disinfection process can control waterborne diseases well it produces disinfection by products dbps which have drawn great attention over the last four decades mainly due to their potential genotoxicity and carcinogenicity bond et al 2011 huang et al 2018b pan et al 2017 richardson et al 2007 sedlak and von gunten 2011 moreover some dbps with odor and taste properties can lead to off flavour problems in drinking water which is also of great concern since consumers use organoleptic properties to assess the safety of drinking water dong et al 2021 freuze et al 2004 young et al 1996 amino acids aas are an important class in the dissolved organic nitrogen don pool the concentrations of free aas were observed at μg l level in natural water while combined aas were nearly 10 times more abundant than free aas chinn and barrett 2000 dotson and westerhoff 2009 yang et al 2020 since traditional drinking water treatment processes and new membrane processes are of little use in removing low molecular weight free aas and some short oligopeptides these compounds would mainly pass through such processes and react with disinfectants forming dbps dotson and westerhoff 2009 previous studies have focused on the formation of toxic products including carbonaceous c and nitrogenous n dbps and organic chloramines during chlorination of free and combined aas chu et al 2015 fox et al 1997 keefe et al 1997 yu and reckhow 2020 for odorous disinfection by products o dbps earlier studies have indicated that chlorination of certain free aas such as valine val leucine leu isoleucine ile and phenylalanine phe can produce odorous aldehydes nitriles and n chloroaldimines r ch ncl which are stable and have low odor perception thresholds opts at the μg l level refer to table s supporting information 1 for details conyers and scully 1993 conyers et al 1993 freuze et al 2004 2005 how et al 2017 2018 mccormick et al 1993 and the concentrations of these o dbps in the drinking water of some areas have been determined to exceed their opts leading to off flavor issues brosillon et al 2009 lu et al 2020 our group first proposed the mechanism of o dbp formation from combined aas during chlorination and studied technologies to control o dbp formation cai et al 2020 2019 of note instead of chlorine many drinking water treatment plants have chosen chloramine as a disinfectant to control the formation of c dbps such as thms and haas pan et al 2016 richardson 2003 with the increasingly widespread application of chloramines whether chloramination of aas would increase the formation potentials fps of other toxic dbps has attracted much attention chu et al 2012 found that the addition of ammonia during chlorination of tyrosine can significantly reduce the formation of most c dbps but increases the yields of some n dbps linge et al 2020 also reported that using monochloramine nh2cl as a disinfectant in water containing aas produced dichloroacetonitrile moreover new dbps including iodinated brominated and mixed halogenated tyrosyl dipeptides were observed by huang et al 2019 2018a during chloramination of tyrosyl dipeptides however hardly any investigations have focused on o dbp formation during chloramination of aas as using chloramine in disinfection increases the fps of n dbps investigating the formation of o dbps during chloramination is particularly necessary therefore the objective of this study was to investigate the formation of three typical o dbps i e isovaleraldehyde isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine during chloramination of leu a typical and abundant aa in many drinking water sources in its free and combined forms free leu and glycylleucine gly leu were chosen as model compounds according to a previous study by our group indicating that both compounds are precursors of the three o dbps cai et al 2020 the evolution of these o dbps over time during chloramination of leu and gly leu was studied mechanisms of o dbps formations from chloramination of selected aa and dipeptide were proposed based on the measurement of intermediate products and the reaction rate constants were determined through modeling using kintecus software ianni 2019 moreover since adding ammonia and chlorine separately is sometimes used in chloramination six disinfection schemes were applied to assess whether the order of adding ammonia and free chlorine or the pre chlorination contact time would impact the formation of o dbps the effects of disinfectant dosage and ph on the o dbps yields under different disinfection schemes were also investigated by experiments and simulations finally the three o dbps formations during chlor am ination of real water under the six disinfection schemes were detected this study is necessary for a better understanding of the causes of off flavor issues during chloramination in drinking water and makes it possible to optimize the disinfection process to reduce the fps of o dbps 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents all chemicals used which were at least analytical reagent grade were listed in table s2 all solutions were prepared in millipore water without chlorine demand 2 2 water sampling raw water samples were collected from the wujiang drinking water treatment plant dwtp in august 2021 this dwtp uses taihu lake as the water source which is the third largest freshwater lake in china the water quality characteristics of the water samples are listed in table s3 2 3 experimental procedures first a determined amount of an individual model precursor was introduced into 200 ml of phosphate buffer solution 0 2 m ph 7 0 0 1 to obtain two 0 1 mm aas leu and gly leu buffer solutions a free chlorine solution was freshly prepared on the day of use by diluting a commercial sodium hypochlorite naclo solution 6 14 nh2cl solution was prepared daily by adding naclo slowly to a rapidly stirred ammonium chloride nh4cl solution at a molar ratio of naclo to nh4cl of 0 8 at ph 8 3 for 1 h both free chlorine and nh2cl solutions were standardized prior to use appropriate micro volumes of nh2cl or free chlorine and nh4cl solutions were added into every 10 ml buffered aas solution to reach the prescribed cl n ratio the molar ratio of cl in hocl or nh2cl to nitrogen in aas under headspace free condition after stirring for 15 s the samples were incubated in the dark at room temperature 25 0 5 c for 72 h at each designated reaction time t 1 3 6 9 21 24 27 32 44 48 52 56 68 and 72 h one samples were transferred into a 20 ml brown headspace sample vial for o dbps analysis to acquire the evolution of o dbps during 72 h the samples were analyzed immediately without quenching since the quenched agent can react with n chloroisovaleraldimine to study whether the order of adding ammonia and chlorine and pre chlorination contact time would impact the formation of o dbps different disinfection schemes were used as shown in table 1 in scheme 2 preformed nh2cl was added whereas in schemes 3 6 chlorine and ammonia were added separately to realize chloramination different cl n ratios were applied to study the effect of the cl n ratio on o dbp formation the impact of ph was investigated by adjusting the ph using h2so4 or naoh experiments were carried out in triplicates and a pair of blanks were contained in each set of samples the error bars represented one standard deviation 2 4 chemical analysis the concentration of free chlorine was detected by a portable residual chlorine meter pcii hach usa as described in text s1 in detail while nh2cl was measured using the monochlorf reagent method lee and westerhoff 2009 solution ph was measured by a ph meter la ph 10 hach usa the aas in raw water samples were first enriched by solid phase extraction spe before determination of aas the details of the spe are listed in text s2 the concentrations of 20 kinds free aas in real water were then determined by high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms agilent usa after hydrolysis pre treatment hanamachi et al 2008 the total concentration of each kind of aa was measured the concentrations of combined aas were the difference between the total aas and free aas the details of the measurement conditions of hplc ms ms were described in our previous study cai et al 2019 volatile o dbps including isovaleraldehyde isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine were measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry 5977 7890b agilent usa the

3 results and discussion 3 1 evolution of o dbps from free leu and gly leu during chloramination over time fig 1 a and b displayed the evolution of isovaleraldehyde isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine during the chloramination of free leu a and gly leu b over 72 h at a cl n ratio of 2 4 using preformed nh2cl the corresponding simulated results obtained by modelling using kintecus software ianni 2019 were shown in fig 1 and table 2 and details of the model and fitting were described in text s3 as shown in fig 1a the yields the molar ratio of odorous by product to the initial aas of isovaleraldehyde isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine during chloramination of free leu using preformed nh2cl reached maxima of 30 7 4 0 and 2 8 at 3 h 9 h and 6 h respectively the formation of isovaleraldehyde was significantly greater than that of the other two o dbps during chloramination with preformed nh2cl active chlorine cl can transfer from nh2cl to nitrogenous organic compounds organic n including aas and dipeptides to form n chloro organic n but at slow rates which indicated that the cl in nh2cl has a low activity isaac and morris 1983 the low reaction rate constants kb1 and kb4 in table 2 determined by kintecus also confirmed the slow rates of the two n chloro organic n i e n monochloroleucine b2 fig 3b and n n dichloroleucine b5 fig 3b formations from free leu and showed n n dichloroleucine was difficult to produce from free leu during chloramination suggesting that more free leu would only be substituted into n monochloroleucine since the n monochloroleucine would decompose into isovaleraldehyde b2 b4 fig 3b cai et al 2019 how et al 2018 the isovaleraldehyde was formed the most among the three o dbps from fig 1b no isovaleraldehyde was detected during chloramination of gly leu and hardly any isovaleronitrile or n chloroisovaleraldimine was formed over 72 h as mentioned above cl can transfer from nh2cl to gly leu to form n chloro dipeptides a2 and a3 fig 3a with slow reaction rates which has also been confirmed by the low values of ka1 and ka2 in table 2 determined by kintecus therefore the formation of n chloro dipeptides from gly leu would be low which then decreased the yields of free leu from n chloro dipeptides decompositions fig 3a and subsequently suppressed the formation of o dbps from chloramination of free leu fig 3b notably the total formation of o dbps during chloramination of free leu and gly leu significantly decreased compared with that during the chlorination of the two precursors indicating that using nh2cl as a disinfectant can reduce the fps of o dbps from aas to some degree 3 2 effects of different disinfection schemes fig 2 a and b displayed the amounts of the three o dbps during chlor am ination of free leu a and gly leu b under the six different disinfection schemes listed in table 1 as shown in fig 2a chloramination by using preformed nh2cl led to the formation of more isovaleraldehyde which has been illustrated in section 3 1 furthermore the chloramination scheme with adding ammonia before chlorine also resulted in a high yield of isovaleraldehyde which was the maximum among all the schemes this was because the competitive reaction of chlorine with pre added ammonia k 1 80 106 m 1s 1 instead of the reaction with n monochloroleucine k 4 85 102 m 1s 1 suppressed n monochloroleucine from being chlorinated into n n dichloroleucine which caused more n monochloroleucine to decompose to isovaleraldehyde and decreased the formation of isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine from n n dichloroleucine how et al 2018 observed a similar phenomenon however when chlorine was introduced before ammonia the abundant pre added chlorine preferentially reacted with free leu to produce n n dichloroleucine which decomposed to isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine cai et al 2020 thus the formation of isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine exceeded that of isovaleraldehyde and increased with the pre chlorination contact time these results indicated that when chlorine and ammonia were added separately a longer pre chlorination time promoted the formation of isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine from free leu during chloramination while adding ammonia before chlorine greatly increased the formation of isovaleraldehyde of note unlike other disinfection schemes when using preformed nh2cl or adding ammonia before chlorine the n chloroisovaleraldimine concentration exceeded that of isovaleronitrile mainly because the presence of a high concentration of nh2cl and the high formation of isovaleraldehyde under the two schemes promoted the chloramination of isovaleraldehyde to form n chloramino alcohol b4 b7 fig 3 b which was then transformed into n chloroisovaleraldimine b7 b6 fig 3b the formation of o dbps from gly leu under different disinfection schemes was depicted in fig 2b significantly low production of o dbps was observed when preformed nh2cl was used which has been explained in section 3 1 and when chlorine and ammonia were added separately the o dbps formations increased with the pre chlorination contact time mainly because a longer pre chlorination time enabled gly leu to form more n chloro dipeptides which degraded into free leu and then produced more o dbps cai et al 2020 the fact that during chlorination alone the highest yields of o dbps were obtained also confirmed this point 3 3 mechanisms based on the results of the intermediate product analysis listed in table s5 the proposed pathways by which chloramination of gly leu a and b and leu b formed o dbps were displayed in fig 3a and b it has been proven that the cl transfer from nh2cl to organic n such as aas and dipeptides during chloramination to form n chloro organic n through two pathways eqs 1 and 2 eq 1 indicated the direct transfer of cl from nh2cl to organic n eq 2 refers to the hydrolysis of nh2cl into hocl which then reacts with organic n isaac and morris 1983 therefore during chloramination of free leu and gly leu cl transferred from nh2cl to the two organic n producing n mono and n n dichlorinated free leu and gly leu a2 a3 b2 and b5 fig 3 after that these n mono or n n dichlorinated organic n decomposed to produce the three o dbps which shared a little similarity with chlorination of free leu and gly leu cai et al 2020 however comparing with chlorination of the two precursors chloramination has its uniqueness by participating in reacting with isovaleraldehyde to produce n chloroisovaleraldimine b4 b7 b6 fig 3b indicating that the n chloroisovaleraldimine was formed not only from the decomposition of n n dichloroleucine b5 b6 fig 3 but also from isovaleraldehyde during chloramination of leu this can also explain the results shown in fig 2a when using preformed nh2cl or adding ammonia before chlorine to realize chloramination due to the high yields of isovaleraldehyde under these two schemes the formation of n chloroisovaleraldimine exceeded that of isovaleronitrile 1 nh2c1 organic n n chloro compound nh3 2a nh2c1 h2o nh3 hoc1 2b organic n hoc1 n chloro compound h2o the reaction rate constants of all steps were determined by modeling using kintecus software ianni 2019 which was described in text s3 in detail and the results were shown in table 2 3 4 effect of cl n ratio fig 4 a f displayed the impact of the cl n ratio on the formation of o dbps from free leu a c and e and gly leu b d and f during chloramination using three representative disinfection schemes schemes 2 4 table 1 four cl n ratios 0 8 1 2 2 4 and 3 0 were applied the simulations shown in fig 4 were conducted by kintecus software according to the results of kinetics analysis obtained in the previous sections the results obtained when using free leu as a precursor were shown in fig 4a c and e among the four applied cl n ratios the formation of isovaleraldehyde under the three schemes was the highest when cl n 1 6 1 6 and 0 8 respectively and the yields of isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine increased with the cl n ratio this was mainly because both nh2cl and hocl in these schemes reacted with free leu by transferring cl to free leu to form n chloro compounds and higher cl n ratios in the reaction systems would promote the formation of n n dichloroleucine b5 fig 3b which degraded into isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine whereas n monochloroleucine b2 fig 3b as the precursor of isovaleraldehyde has been demonstrated to reach a very high content at a cl n ratio of approximately 0 8 1 6 cai et al 2019 freuze et al 2005 which then lead to the high yield of isovaleraldehyde of note as mentioned before chloramination of isovaleraldehyde can also produce n chloroisovaleraldimine thus when ammonia was added first fig 4c with both the high level of nh2cl and the extremely high yield of isovaleraldehyde under this scheme a more significant increase in n chloroisovaleraldimine formation than isovaleronitrile formation with increasing cl n ratios was observed from fig 4b d and f the formation of the three o dbps from gly leu during chloramination under the three representative schemes increased with the cl n ratio since both nh2cl and hocl in these schemes transferred cl to gly leu to form n chloro compounds a higher cl n ratio in reaction systems could promote the formation of n chloro compounds from gly leu and then the decomposition of n chloro compounds lead to more formation of free leu which subsequently produced more o dbps all the simulated results were generally consistent with the experimental results reconfirming that the kinetics model established in the previous sections table 2 and fig 1 was reliable which can be used to predict the formation of o dbps under different disinfectant dosages and may offer guidance for practical operation 3 5 effect of ph the impact of the initial solution ph on the formation of o dbps from free leu a c and e and gly leu b d and f during chloramination using three representative addition schemes schemes 2 4 table 1 and the results of the simulations conducted by kintecus software according to the obtained kinetic analysis results were shown in fig s1a f during chloramination of free leu under the three addition schemes the formation of isovaleraldehyde was significantly high at ph 5 in contrast the yields of the other the two o dbps increased with the ph this was probably because under acidic conditions nh2cl tended to transform into dichloramine nhcl2 which has a much weaker disinfection capacity and cl activity than nh2cl schreiber and mitch 2005 and thus free leu may be substituted more into n monochloroleucine rather than n n dichloroleucine which increased isovaleraldehyde yield from degradation of n monochloroleucine but suppressed the formation of isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine from n n dichloroleucine moreover when chlorine and ammonia were added separately since the formation of nhcl2 would consume more free chlorine under the acidic conditions the promotion of nhcl2 formation led to less remaining free chlorine the low contents of free chlorine tended to chlorinated free leu into n monochloroleucine then decomposing into isovaleraldehyde which also contributed to the high isovaleraldehyde yield under acidic conditions on the contrary under alkaline conditions due to the less formation of nhcl2 more free leu would be substituted to form n n dichloroleucine which then promoted the formation of isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine during chloramination of gly leu under the three disinfection schemes as mentioned in the last paragraph since acidic conditions promoted more formation of nhcl2 rather than nh2cl leading to low cl transfer efficiency gly leu would form less n chloro compounds as well as free leu which subsequently produced low yields of o dbps all the simulated results matched well with the experimental results which would be helpful for practical operation 3 6 formation of three o dbps in real water during chlor am ination under different disinfection schemes taihu lake is the third largest freshwater lake in china and the water source for twenty million people in several cities however quantities of nutrients have been introduced into taihu lake via the random discharge of wastewater over the past few decades which has made the lake severely eutrophic and caused algal blooms to occur guo 2007 since the aas contents in surface water was strongly relevant to the algae activity hureiki et al 1994 the total dissolved aas contents in taihu lake are abundant and varied with seasons which were determined to be 0 27 3 95 μm yao et al 2013 and the concentration of free leu in taihu lake has been reported to be 0 57 2 87 μg l yang et al 2020 fig s2 showed the concentrations of 20 kinds aas in both free and combined forms from taihu lake in august 2021 the concentrations of free leu and combined leu were 2 69 and 9 82 μg l respectively considering the maximum conversions of free and combined leu to the three targeted o dbps during chlor am ination reported above and in previous studies cai et al 2020 2019 freuze et al 2004 how et al 2017 if the aas in taihu lake cannot be well removed before disinfection the formation of odorous isovaleraldehyde and n chloroisovaleraldimine during chlor am ination of free and combined leu in taihu lake is highly likely to exceed their opts table s1 fig 5 a c displayed the formation of isovaleraldehyde isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine during 6 h and 24 h chlor am ination of real water from taihu lake using different disinfectant dosages under the six disinfection schemes table 1 it can be seen that the o dbps formations in real water generally followed the same trend as that in the laboratory experiments when chlorine was introduced alone or before ammonia the formation of isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine was higher than that of isovaleraldehyde and the n chloroisovaleraldimines concentrations under these schemes were approximately 4 8 times higher than its opt in contrast adding ammonia before chlorine or nh2cl alone greatly promoted the formation of isovaleraldehyde which also exceeded its opt especially when ammonia was introduced before chlorine the isovaleraldehydes concentrations were approximately 10 20 times higher than its opt and chloramination of such a large amount of isovaleraldehyde also led to more formation of n chloroisovaleraldimine which was about 2 4 times as its opt furthermore as the reaction time increased from 6 h to 24 h the formation of o dbps during chlor am ination generally decreased except that the isovaleronitrile formation during chlorination alone significantly increased this was mainly because combined leu can produce a large amount of isovaleronitrile after 24 h chlorination reaction cai et al 2020 these results indicated that the formation of n chloroisovaleraldimine and isovaleraldehyde during chlor am ination of real water in taihu lake was highly likely to cause odorous problems in drinking water if the aas cannot be well removed before disinfection 4 conclusions o dbps including isovaleraldehyde isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine were produced during chloramination of free leu and gly leu the formation of o dbps from the selected aa and dipeptide during chloramination with preformed nh2cl was significantly less than that during chlorination indicating that using preformed nh2cl for disinfection can control the off flavor problems caused by aas to some degree when chloramination was realized by introducing chlorine and ammonia separately the formation of o dbps mainly depended on the addition order of the two reagents and the pre chlorination time a longer pre chlorination time led to greater yields of o dbps from both precursors whereas adding ammonia before chlorine promoted more isovaleraldehyde formation from free leu notably comparing with chlorination chloramination of free leu and gly leu has its uniqueness by participating in reacting with isovaleraldehyde to form n chloroisovaleraldimine therefore under the scheme in which preformed nh2cl was used or ammonia was added first since isovaleraldehyde had an extremely high yield more n chloroisovaleraldimine was formed from chloramination of isovaleraldehyde leading to a higher concentration of n chloroisovaleraldimine even exceeding that of isovaleronitrile moreover the o dbps yields from free leu were greater than those from gly leu under all addition schemes of disinfectants the formation of o dbps increased with the cl n ratios except for isovaleraldehyde formation from free leu which reached a maximum at cl n 0 8 1 6 under acidic ph more isovaleraldehyde than other compounds were formed whereas alkaline conditions promoted the formation of isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine simulations of experiments investigating the impacts of cl n ratio and ph matched well with the experimental results indicating that the established kinetics model was reliable and useful for predicting the formation of o dbps under different conditions the results also suggested that reducing the cl n ratio and ph appropriately within acceptable ranges was able to decrease the occurrence potential of off flavor issues during chloramination to some degree in addition chlor am ination experiments with real water from taihu lake under different disinfection schemes indicated that the formation of n chloroisovaleraldimine and isovaleraldehyde was highly likely to cause odorous problems in drinking water if the aas in taihu lake

tyrosine can significantly reduce the formation of most c dbps but increases the yields of some n dbps linge et al 2020 also reported that using monochloramine nh2cl as a disinfectant in water containing aas produced dichloroacetonitrile moreover new dbps including iodinated brominated and mixed halogenated tyrosyl dipeptides were observed by huang et al 2019 2018a during chloramination of tyrosyl dipeptides however hardly any investigations have focused on o dbp formation during chloramination of aas as using chloramine in disinfection increases the fps of n dbps investigating the formation of o dbps during chloramination is particularly necessary therefore the objective of this study was to investigate the formation of three typical o dbps i e isovaleraldehyde isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine during chloramination of leu a typical and abundant aa in many drinking water sources in its free and combined forms free leu and glycylleucine gly leu were chosen as model compounds according to a previous study by our group indicating that both compounds are precursors of the three o dbps cai et al 2020 the evolution of these o dbps over time during chloramination of leu and gly leu was studied mechanisms of o dbps formations from chloramination of selected aa and dipeptide were proposed based on the measurement of intermediate products and the reaction rate constants were determined through modeling using kintecus software ianni 2019 moreover since adding ammonia and chlorine separately is sometimes used in chloramination six disinfection schemes were applied to assess whether the order of adding ammonia and free chlorine or the pre chlorination contact time would impact the formation of o dbps the effects of disinfectant dosage and ph on the o dbps yields under different disinfection schemes were also investigated by experiments and simulations finally the three o dbps formations during chlor am ination of real water under the six disinfection schemes were detected this study is necessary for a better understanding of the causes of off flavor issues during chloramination in drinking water and makes it possible to optimize the disinfection process to reduce the fps of o dbps 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents all chemicals used which were at least analytical reagent grade were listed in table s2 all solutions were prepared in millipore water without chlorine demand 2 2 water sampling raw water samples were collected from the wujiang drinking water treatment plant dwtp in august 2021 this dwtp uses taihu lake as the water source which is the third largest freshwater lake in china the water quality characteristics of the water samples are listed in table s3 2 3 experimental procedures first a determined amount of an individual model precursor was introduced into 200 ml of phosphate buffer solution 0 2 m ph 7 0 0 1 to obtain two 0 1 mm aas leu and gly leu buffer solutions a free chlorine solution was freshly prepared on the day of use by diluting a commercial sodium hypochlorite naclo solution 6 14 nh2cl solution was prepared daily by adding naclo slowly to a rapidly stirred ammonium chloride nh4cl solution at a molar ratio of naclo to nh4cl of 0 8 at ph 8 3 for 1 h both free chlorine and nh2cl solutions were standardized prior to use appropriate micro volumes of nh2cl or free chlorine and nh4cl solutions were added into every 10 ml buffered aas solution to reach the prescribed cl n ratio the molar ratio of cl in hocl or nh2cl to nitrogen in aas under headspace free condition after stirring for 15 s the samples were incubated in the dark at room temperature 25 0 5 c for 72 h at each designated reaction time t 1 3 6 9 21 24 27 32 44 48 52 56 68 and 72 h one samples were transferred into a 20 ml brown headspace sample vial for o dbps analysis to acquire the evolution of o dbps during 72 h the samples were analyzed immediately without quenching since the quenched agent can react with n chloroisovaleraldimine to study whether the order of adding ammonia and chlorine and pre chlorination contact time would impact the formation of o dbps different disinfection schemes were used as shown in table 1 in scheme 2 preformed nh2cl was added whereas in schemes 3 6 chlorine and ammonia were added separately to realize chloramination different cl n ratios were applied to study the effect of the cl n ratio on o dbp formation the impact of ph was investigated by adjusting the ph using h2so4 or naoh experiments were carried out in triplicates and a pair of blanks were contained in each set of samples the error bars represented one standard deviation 2 4 chemical analysis the concentration of free chlorine was detected by a portable residual chlorine meter pcii hach usa as described in text s1 in detail while nh2cl was measured using the monochlorf reagent method lee and westerhoff 2009 solution ph was measured by a ph meter la ph 10 hach usa the aas in raw water samples were first enriched by solid phase extraction spe before determination of aas the details of the spe are listed in text s2 the concentrations of 20 kinds free aas in real water were then determined by high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms agilent usa after hydrolysis pre treatment hanamachi et al 2008 the total concentration of each kind of aa was measured the concentrations of combined aas were the difference between the total aas and free aas the details of the measurement conditions of hplc ms ms were described in our previous study cai et al 2019 volatile o dbps including isovaleraldehyde isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine were measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry 5977 7890b agilent usa the

3 results and discussion 3 1 evolution of o dbps from free leu and gly leu during chloramination over time fig 1 a and b displayed the evolution of isovaleraldehyde isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine during the chloramination of free leu a and gly leu b over 72 h at a cl n ratio of 2 4 using preformed nh2cl the corresponding simulated results obtained by modelling using kintecus software ianni 2019 were shown in fig 1 and table 2 and details of the model and fitting were described in text s3 as shown in fig 1a the yields the molar ratio of odorous by product to the initial aas of isovaleraldehyde isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine during chloramination of free leu using preformed nh2cl reached maxima of 30 7 4 0 and 2 8 at 3 h 9 h and 6 h respectively the formation of isovaleraldehyde was significantly greater than that of the other two o dbps during chloramination with preformed nh2cl active chlorine cl can transfer from nh2cl to nitrogenous organic compounds organic n including aas and dipeptides to form n chloro organic n but at slow rates which indicated that the cl in nh2cl has a low activity isaac and morris 1983 the low reaction rate constants kb1 and kb4 in table 2 determined by kintecus also confirmed the slow rates of the two n chloro organic n i e n monochloroleucine b2 fig 3b and n n dichloroleucine b5 fig 3b formations from free leu and showed n n dichloroleucine was difficult to produce from free leu during chloramination suggesting that more free leu would only be substituted into n monochloroleucine since the n monochloroleucine would decompose into isovaleraldehyde b2 b4 fig 3b cai et al 2019 how et al 2018 the isovaleraldehyde was formed the most among the three o dbps from fig 1b no isovaleraldehyde was detected during chloramination of gly leu and hardly any isovaleronitrile or n chloroisovaleraldimine was formed over 72 h as mentioned above cl can transfer from nh2cl to gly leu to form n chloro dipeptides a2 and a3 fig 3a with slow reaction rates which has also been confirmed by the low values of ka1 and ka2 in table 2 determined by kintecus therefore the formation of n chloro dipeptides from gly leu would be low which then decreased the yields of free leu from n chloro dipeptides decompositions fig 3a and subsequently suppressed the formation of o dbps from chloramination of free leu fig 3b notably the total formation of o dbps during chloramination of free leu and gly leu significantly decreased compared with that during the chlorination of the two precursors indicating that using nh2cl as a disinfectant can reduce the fps of o dbps from aas to some degree 3 2 effects of different disinfection schemes fig 2 a and b displayed the amounts of the three o dbps during chlor am ination of free leu a and gly leu b under the six different disinfection schemes listed in table 1 as shown in fig 2a chloramination by using preformed nh2cl led to the formation of more isovaleraldehyde which has been illustrated in section 3 1 furthermore the chloramination scheme with adding ammonia before chlorine also resulted in a high yield of isovaleraldehyde which was the maximum among all the schemes this was because the competitive reaction of chlorine with pre added ammonia k 1 80 106 m 1s 1 instead of the reaction with n monochloroleucine k 4 85 102 m 1s 1 suppressed n monochloroleucine from being chlorinated into n n dichloroleucine which caused more n monochloroleucine to decompose to isovaleraldehyde and decreased the formation of isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine from n n dichloroleucine how et al 2018 observed a similar phenomenon however when chlorine was introduced before ammonia the abundant pre added chlorine preferentially reacted with free leu to produce n n dichloroleucine which decomposed to isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine cai et al 2020 thus the formation of isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine exceeded that of isovaleraldehyde and increased with the pre chlorination contact time these results indicated that when chlorine and ammonia were added separately a longer pre chlorination time promoted the formation of isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine from free leu during chloramination while adding ammonia before chlorine greatly increased the formation of isovaleraldehyde of note unlike other disinfection schemes when using preformed nh2cl or adding ammonia before chlorine the n chloroisovaleraldimine concentration exceeded that of isovaleronitrile mainly because the presence of a high concentration of nh2cl and the high formation of isovaleraldehyde under the two schemes promoted the chloramination of isovaleraldehyde to form n chloramino alcohol b4 b7 fig 3 b which was then transformed into n chloroisovaleraldimine b7 b6 fig 3b the formation of o dbps from gly leu under different disinfection schemes was depicted in fig 2b significantly low production of o dbps was observed when preformed nh2cl was used which has been explained in section 3 1 and when chlorine and ammonia were added separately the o dbps formations increased with the pre chlorination contact time mainly because a longer pre chlorination time enabled gly leu to form more n chloro dipeptides which degraded into free leu and then produced more o dbps cai et al 2020 the fact that during chlorination alone the highest yields of o dbps were obtained also confirmed this point 3 3 mechanisms based on the results of the intermediate product analysis listed in table s5 the proposed pathways by which chloramination of gly leu a and b and leu b formed o dbps were displayed in fig 3a and b it has been proven that the cl transfer from nh2cl to organic n such as aas and dipeptides during chloramination to form n chloro organic n through two pathways eqs 1 and 2 eq 1 indicated the direct transfer of cl from nh2cl to organic n eq 2 refers to the hydrolysis of nh2cl into hocl which then reacts with organic n isaac and morris 1983 therefore during chloramination of free leu and gly leu cl transferred from nh2cl to the two organic n producing n mono and n n dichlorinated free leu and gly leu a2 a3 b2 and b5 fig 3 after that these n mono or n n dichlorinated organic n decomposed to produce the three o dbps which shared a little similarity with chlorination of free leu and gly leu cai et al 2020 however comparing with chlorination of the two precursors chloramination has its uniqueness by participating in reacting with isovaleraldehyde to produce n chloroisovaleraldimine b4 b7 b6 fig 3b indicating that the n chloroisovaleraldimine was formed not only from the decomposition of n n dichloroleucine b5 b6 fig 3 but also from isovaleraldehyde during chloramination of leu this can also explain the results shown in fig 2a when using preformed nh2cl or adding ammonia before chlorine to realize chloramination due to the high yields of isovaleraldehyde under these two schemes the formation of n chloroisovaleraldimine exceeded that of isovaleronitrile 1 nh2c1 organic n n chloro compound nh3 2a nh2c1 h2o nh3 hoc1 2b organic n hoc1 n chloro compound h2o the reaction rate constants of all steps were determined by modeling using kintecus software ianni 2019 which was described in text s3 in detail and the results were shown in table 2 3 4 effect of cl n ratio fig 4 a f displayed the impact of the cl n ratio on the formation of o dbps from free leu a c and e and gly leu b d and f during chloramination using three representative disinfection schemes schemes 2 4 table 1 four cl n ratios 0 8 1 2 2 4 and 3 0 were applied the simulations shown in fig 4 were conducted by kintecus software according to the results of kinetics analysis obtained in the previous sections the results obtained when using free leu as a precursor were shown in fig 4a c and e among the four applied cl n ratios the formation of isovaleraldehyde under the three schemes was the highest when cl n 1 6 1 6 and 0 8 respectively and the yields of isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine increased with the cl n ratio this was mainly because both nh2cl and hocl in these schemes reacted with free leu by transferring cl to free leu to form n chloro compounds and higher cl n ratios in the reaction systems would promote the formation of n n dichloroleucine b5 fig 3b which degraded into isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine whereas n monochloroleucine b2 fig 3b as the precursor of isovaleraldehyde has been demonstrated to reach a very high content at a cl n ratio of approximately 0 8 1 6 cai et al 2019 freuze et al 2005 which then lead to the high yield of isovaleraldehyde of note as mentioned before chloramination of isovaleraldehyde can also produce n chloroisovaleraldimine thus when ammonia was added first fig 4c with both the high level of nh2cl and the extremely high yield of isovaleraldehyde under this scheme a more significant increase in n chloroisovaleraldimine formation than isovaleronitrile formation with increasing cl n ratios was observed from fig 4b d and f the formation of the three o dbps from gly leu during chloramination under the three representative schemes increased with the cl n ratio since both nh2cl and hocl in these schemes transferred cl to gly leu to form n chloro compounds a higher cl n ratio in reaction systems could promote the formation of n chloro compounds from gly leu and then the decomposition of n chloro compounds lead to more formation of free leu which subsequently produced more o dbps all the simulated results were generally consistent with the experimental results reconfirming that the kinetics model established in the previous sections table 2 and fig 1 was reliable which can be used to predict the formation of o dbps under different disinfectant dosages and may offer guidance for practical operation 3 5 effect of ph the impact of the initial solution ph on the formation of o dbps from free leu a c and e and gly leu b d and f during chloramination using three representative addition schemes schemes 2 4 table 1 and the results of the simulations conducted by kintecus software according to the obtained kinetic analysis results were shown in fig s1a f during chloramination of free leu under the three addition schemes the formation of isovaleraldehyde was significantly high at ph 5 in contrast the yields of the other the two o dbps increased with the ph this was probably because under acidic conditions nh2cl tended to transform into dichloramine nhcl2 which has a much weaker disinfection capacity and cl activity than nh2cl schreiber and mitch 2005 and thus free leu may be substituted more into n monochloroleucine rather than n n dichloroleucine which increased isovaleraldehyde yield from degradation of n monochloroleucine but suppressed the formation of isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine from n n dichloroleucine moreover when chlorine and ammonia were added separately since the formation of nhcl2 would consume more free chlorine under the acidic conditions the promotion of nhcl2 formation led to less remaining free chlorine the low contents of free chlorine tended to chlorinated free leu into n monochloroleucine then decomposing into isovaleraldehyde which also contributed to the high isovaleraldehyde yield under acidic conditions on the contrary under alkaline conditions due to the less formation of nhcl2 more free leu would be substituted to form n n dichloroleucine which then promoted the formation of isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine during chloramination of gly leu under the three disinfection schemes as mentioned in the last paragraph since acidic conditions promoted more formation of nhcl2 rather than nh2cl leading to low cl transfer efficiency gly leu would form less n chloro compounds as well as free leu which subsequently produced low yields of o dbps all the simulated results matched well with the experimental results which would be helpful for practical operation 3 6 formation of three o dbps in real water during chlor am ination under different disinfection schemes taihu lake is the third largest freshwater lake in china and the water source for twenty million people in several cities however quantities of nutrients have been introduced into taihu lake via the random discharge of wastewater over the past few decades which has made the lake severely eutrophic and caused algal blooms to occur guo 2007 since the aas contents in surface water was strongly relevant to the algae activity hureiki et al 1994 the total dissolved aas contents in taihu lake are abundant and varied with seasons which were determined to be 0 27 3 95 μm yao et al 2013 and the concentration of free leu in taihu lake has been reported to be 0 57 2 87 μg l yang et al 2020 fig s2 showed the concentrations of 20 kinds aas in both free and combined forms from taihu lake in august 2021 the concentrations of free leu and combined leu were 2 69 and 9 82 μg l respectively considering the maximum conversions of free and combined leu to the three targeted o dbps during chlor am ination reported above and in previous studies cai et al 2020 2019 freuze et al 2004 how et al 2017 if the aas in taihu lake cannot be well removed before disinfection the formation of odorous isovaleraldehyde and n chloroisovaleraldimine during chlor am ination of free and combined leu in taihu lake is highly likely to exceed their opts table s1 fig 5 a c displayed the formation of isovaleraldehyde isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine during 6 h and 24 h chlor am ination of real water from taihu lake using different disinfectant dosages under the six disinfection schemes table 1 it can be seen that the o dbps formations in real water generally followed the same trend as that in the laboratory experiments when chlorine was introduced alone or before ammonia the formation of isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine was higher than that of isovaleraldehyde and the n chloroisovaleraldimines concentrations under these schemes were approximately 4 8 times higher than its opt in contrast adding ammonia before chlorine or nh2cl alone greatly promoted the formation of isovaleraldehyde which also exceeded its opt especially when ammonia was introduced before chlorine the isovaleraldehydes concentrations were approximately 10 20 times higher than its opt and chloramination of such a large amount of isovaleraldehyde also led to more formation of n chloroisovaleraldimine which was about 2 4 times as its opt furthermore as the reaction time increased from 6 h to 24 h the formation of o dbps during chlor am ination generally decreased except that the isovaleronitrile formation during chlorination alone significantly increased this was mainly because combined leu can produce a large amount of isovaleronitrile after 24 h chlorination reaction cai et al 2020 these results indicated that the formation of n chloroisovaleraldimine and isovaleraldehyde during chlor am ination of real water in taihu lake was highly likely to cause odorous problems in drinking water if the aas cannot be well removed before disinfection 4 conclusions o dbps including isovaleraldehyde isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine were produced during chloramination of free leu and gly leu the formation of o dbps from the selected aa and dipeptide during chloramination with preformed nh2cl was significantly less than that during chlorination indicating that using preformed nh2cl for disinfection can control the off flavor problems caused by aas to some degree when chloramination was realized by introducing chlorine and ammonia separately the formation of o dbps mainly depended on the addition order of the two reagents and the pre chlorination time a longer pre chlorination time led to greater yields of o dbps from both precursors whereas adding ammonia before chlorine promoted more isovaleraldehyde formation from free leu notably comparing with chlorination chloramination of free leu and gly leu has its uniqueness by participating in reacting with isovaleraldehyde to form n chloroisovaleraldimine therefore under the scheme in which preformed nh2cl was used or ammonia was added first since isovaleraldehyde had an extremely high yield more n chloroisovaleraldimine was formed from chloramination of isovaleraldehyde leading to a higher concentration of n chloroisovaleraldimine even exceeding that of isovaleronitrile moreover the o dbps yields from free leu were greater than those from gly leu under all addition schemes of disinfectants the formation of o dbps increased with the cl n ratios except for isovaleraldehyde formation from free leu which reached a maximum at cl n 0 8 1 6 under acidic ph more isovaleraldehyde than other compounds were formed whereas alkaline conditions promoted the formation of isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine simulations of experiments investigating the impacts of cl n ratio and ph matched well with the experimental results indicating that the established kinetics model was reliable and useful for predicting the formation of o dbps under different conditions the results also suggested that reducing the cl n ratio and ph appropriately within acceptable ranges was able to decrease the occurrence potential of off flavor issues during chloramination to some degree in addition chlor am ination experiments with real water from taihu lake under different disinfection schemes indicated that the formation of n chloroisovaleraldimine and isovaleraldehyde was highly likely to cause odorous problems in drinking water if the aas in taihu lake

16366,in this study a suite of natural wastewater sources is tested to understand the effects of wastewater composition and source on electrochemically driven nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient removal kinetics electrode behavior and removal efficiency were evaluated during electrochemical precipitation whereby a sacrificial magnesium mg anode was used to drive precipitation of ammonium and phosphate the electrochemical reactor demonstrated fast kinetics in the natural wastewater matrices removing up to 54 of the phosphate present in natural wastewater within 1 min with an energy input of only 0 04 kwh m 3 after 1 min phosphate removal followed a zero order rate law in the 1 min 30 min range the zero order rate constant k appears to depend upon differences in wastewater composition where a faster rate constant is associated with higher cl and nh4 concentrations lower ca2 concentrations and higher organic carbon content the sacrificial mg anode showed the lowest corrosion resistance in the natural industrial wastewater source with an increased corrosion rate v corr of 15 8 mm y 1 compared to 1 9 3 5 mm y 1 in municipal wastewater sources while the tafel slopes β showed a direct correlation with the natural wastewater composition and origin an overall improvement of water quality was observed where important water quality parameters such as total organic carbon toc total suspended solids tss and turbidity showed a significant decrease an economic analysis revealed costs based upon experimental mg consumption are estimated to range from 0 19 m 3 to 0 30 m 3 but costs based upon theoretical mg consumption range from 0 09 m 3 to 0 18 m 3 overall this study highlights that water chemistry parameters control nutrient recovery while electrochemical treatment does not directly produce potable water and that economic analysis should be based upon experimentally determined mg consumption data synopsis statement magnesium driven electrochemical precipitation of natural wastewater sources enables fast kinetics for phosphate removal at low energy input graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electrochemistry magnesium corrosion natural wastewater nutrient removal 1 introduction agro industrial and municipal wastewater effluents are well known for their high levels of nutrients like phosphorus p nitrogen n or organic matter therefore it is crucial to treat these effluents before they are discharged into receiving water bodies to minimize potential environmental impacts and water quality problems on a global scale rasmussen et al 2018 tilman et al 2011 phosphorus is a non renewable resource where the majority is mined from rock phosphate and its geographic concentration may generate compelling political or economic risks for many countries godfray et al 2010 as the supply of rock phosphate steadily decreases the costs of fertilizers will increase significantly impacting the affordability of food products cordell et al 2009 consequently alternative sources for p should be considered with the emphasis on recyclable or reusable sources from various wastes to facilitate a sustainable global supply of p researchers have shown the possibility to recover p from various waste sources in the form of a precipitate known as struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o or map a white orthorhombic poorly soluble crystal and a premium grade slow

nagy et al 2020a 2019 2020b kruk et al 2014 li et al 2021 lin et al 2018 ren et al 2017 have been proposed as feasible alternatives to existing technologies abel denee et al 2018 shu et al 2019 wang et al 2019b zeng et al 2018 to facilitate electrochemical precipitation a mg based sacrificial anode provides the required amount of mg in the form of mg2 through anodic dissolution corrosion with an applied overpotential η to drive the struvite precipitation reaction the electrochemical behavior of mg based electrodes is complex and still not fully understood controversy still exists about the corrosion and passivation processes of magnesium in general due to the very negative standard reduction potential of the mg mg2 redox couple e mg mg2 2 372 v vs she coates 1945 and non inert material characteristics the anodic dissolution of mg2 in solutions can be best described by a heterogeneous electron transfer coupled with or followed by a homogenous chemical ec reaction although the electrochemical behavior of mg based electrodes has been greatly studied in a wide range of aqueous solutions the water composition has been usually well defined or synthetic and most of these studies have been performed on a bench scale belarbi and trembly 2018 curioni et al 2015 liao et al 2020 liu et al 2019 wu et al 2019 moreover these studies were mainly focused on mg corrosion esmaily et al 2017 p recovery cai et al 2020 struvite production efficiency kékedy nagy et al 2020b and energy input based upon the mg anode type used lei et al 2020 on the other hand systematic studies regarding the general electrochemical behavior of the anode in complex matrixes such as raw industrial or municipal wastewater effluents are still lacking in particular there are a few studies available that compare how the electrochemical system performs across a suite of wastewater sources where a comparison of water chemistry differences is possible due to the wastewater sources being treated by the same electrochemical system and setup in addition detailed studies regarding the impact of electrochemistry on the overall water quality after the electrochemical nutrient removal process by either a single cell batch reactor or a flow reactor have been generally avoided studies have typically focused on the performance of the electrochemical system to remove ammonia and phosphate but have not analyzed a wide range of water chemistry parameters gao et al 2020 lei et al 2019 2021 naresh kumar et al 2019 ren et al 2017 tan et al 2020 wang et al 2019a 2019c our study thus attempts to fill an important knowledge gap on the importance of wastewater source water chemistry in understanding how the mg electrode based electrochemical system performs and the associated effects the water chemistry is expected to have on system optimization finally an economic assessment of the mg electrode driven system is important to consider in the context of overall added cost to a wastewater treatment plant and in comparison to other similar processes in particular it is useful to compare to other electrocoagulation technologies that target coagulation and precipitation of target water components these target water components include heavy metals hardness silica phosphate organics measured as chemical oxygen demand cod or total organic carbon toc and turbidity abdel shafy et al 2020 brahmi et al 2019 espinoza quiñones et al 2009 kobya and demirbas 2015 rodriguez et al 2007 a few studies have evaluated the operating costs for treating wastewater using electrochemical methods with sacrificial anodes consisting of mg abdel shafy et al 2020 hug and udert 2013 however a larger number of studies have examined electrocoagulation systems based on aluminum al bayramoglu et al 2007 brahmi et al 2019 kobya and demirbas 2015 kobya et al 2016 lin et al 2005 rodriguez et al 2007 and iron fe bayramoglu et al 2007 espinoza quiñones et al 2009 inan and alaydın 2014 kobya et al 2016 estimated costs range from 0 25 m 3 to 1 85 m 3 abdel shafy et al 2020 bayramoglu et al 2007 espinoza quiñones et al 2009 kobya et al 2016 a primary difference here in mg driven versus fe or al driven electrocoagulation systems is the treatment goal of nutrient recovery versus the treatment goal of contaminant removal most economic assessments found in the literature are based upon theoretical metal anode consumption estimates which are calculated from the measured cell voltage and current as a function of time both hug and udert 2013 and brahmi et al 2019 however have demonstrated that experimentally determined metal i e mg al consumption can be larger than the theoretical estimate suggesting that cost analyses based upon theoretical consumption likely underestimate the treatment cost in this work a scaled up electrochemical batch reactor was constructed to evaluate nutrient removal from natural wastewater sources with quantification of the kinetics removal efficiency water

collected from the anode surface to eliminate any possible interference from the mg substrate on the resulting spectra before and after the electrochemical studies the composition and the characteristics of the wastewater samples were determined by the arkansas water resource center water quality laboratory awrc wql 2 4 experimental calculations the total hardness expressed as

the electrode material and energy costs kobya et al 2016 in this study the operational costs of the electrochemical process reported as m 3 of treated wastewater were calculated both experimentally and theoretically theoretical calculation is the most commonly used method for estimating input consumption and comparing operational costs in ec studies here we have obtained theoretical values for

volume of wastewater treated m3 the experimental energy consumption was measured for the 2 electrode setup using a kill a watt monitor the experimental mg consumption was determined by calculating the total mg measured in the treated wastewater solution plus the amount of mg consumed as a result of phosphate precipitation we note that the experimental mg consumption is an estimate based upon the assumption that all of the phosphate precipitated as struvite it is likely that the experimental mg consumption is an underestimate as results described below suggest that there was also precipitation of magnesium hydroxide species further detailed studies would be necessary to delineate precipitate species the current efficiency ce was calculated by dividing the dissolved mg m mg dissolved by the value expected from the measured current m mg current using the following equation 10 c e m mg dissolved m mg current 100 where ce is the current efficiency m mg dissolved is the mass of the mg

obtained from the integration of the i vs t curve where i is current in a and t is time in s 3 results and discussion 3 1 nutrient removal and water chemistry of natural wastewaters first the practicality of nutrient removal from various natural wastewater sources see section 2 2 using the scaled up electrochemical batch reactor was investigated the reactor s performance along with the bulk ph and total hardness th of the respective wastewater effluent measured prior and after the electrochemical experiments are presented in table 1 the energy input for nutrient removal varied between 0 63 1 25 kwh m 3 and depended upon the wastewater source all compositions exhibited an increase in their respective ph values where the f ww had the highest with a 2 0 unit increase this was followed by the fs ww and b ww with a 1 5 1 2 unit increase respectively while the p ww showed only a 0 4 unit increase in the ph based upon the main electrochemical reactions see supporting information the ph increase of the wastewater effluents promotes the hydrogen evolution reaction her which occurs simultaneously along with the mg2 release based upon the th as expressed in eq 2 the p ww 16 9 mg l 1 caco3 was classified as soft water the fs ww 48 9 mg l 1 caco3 and b ww 56 8 mg l 1 caco3 were both classified as slightly hard waters while the f ww 122 4 mg l 1 caco3 was classified as hard water table 1 see table s1 for ca2 and mg2 concentrations during the electrochemical experiments a significant increase in the th was observed in all the wastewater samples which placed all of them in the hard water classification this increase was caused by release of mg2 from the mg anode along with no measurable ca2 loss through precipitation table s2 this progressive change of the th over time could have a negative impact on the water quality and influence nutrient removal through electrochemical precipitation based upon the complexity of the wastewater effluents multiple water components present table s1 are expected to play a role in nutrient precipitation and phosphate removal kinetics table 1 therefore it is likely that multiple wastewater components contributed to the enhanced phosphate removal observed for p ww fig 2 the presence of cl and nh4 together enhances mg anode corrosion abbasi et al 2017 curioni et al 2016 ge et al 2021 williams and neil mcmurray 2008 and therefore enhances struvite precipitation due to the increased availability of mg2 in solution across the four wastewaters tested p ww has the highest combined concentration of cl and nh4 a finding which is in good agreement with the enhanced phosphate removal kinetics observed for p ww table 1 and fig 2 the ph of the bulk solution and near the mg electrode also plays a role as increasing ph enhances mg oh 2 formation as a passivating film and as a precipitate ph changes ion speciation and therefore change water chemistry effects on both mg corrosion and precipitation in particular the higher initial ph of the f ww sample likely reduced mg corrosion by reducing nh4 speciation and causing enhanced passivation at the mg anode surface in contrast to the effects of cl and nh4 the presence of ca2 may have a negative impact on nutrient precipitation and phosphate removal generally the presence of significant ca2 concentrations i e ratios of ca mg 1 0 may enhance the precipitation of ca2 po4 3 solids therefore further reducing the purity of the electrochemically obtained struvite one way to reduce the interference of ca2 is by adding extra chemicals to chelate the ca2 ions or fix the ph shen et al 2010 zhou et al 2015 however this may lead to an increase in the operating costs and might change the stoichiometry of the wastewater composition in an alternative approach in this study we applied a limited electrolysis time i e 30 min to minimize the precipitation of calcium in the form of hydroxyapatite or amorphous calcium phosphate due to slower reported ca precipitation kinetics lahav et al 2013 the presence of ca2 ions has been shown to slow the kinetics of struvite precipitation by lengthening the induction time to nucleation acelas et al 2015 kabdaszli et al 2006 le corre et al 2005 yan and shih 2016 the work by li et al showed that lower concentrations of ca2 and or lower ca mg molar ratios minimize the impact of ca on struvite precipitation kinetics li et al 2016 suggesting there may be a minimum ca2 concentration ratio threshold for observation of slowed kinetics this threshold requirement is likely a contributing factor in our results where p ww had a larger rate constant for phosphate removal as compared to the other three wastewater samples even though the ca2 varied amongst f ww fs ww and b ww it is also possible that the larger organic carbon content of the p ww wastewater contributed to ca2 complexation which may have reduced the negative effects of ca on nutrient precipitation in the p ww sample rabinovich and rouff 2021 the natural wastewater samples tested contained in general between 3 6 5 6 mg l 1 of po4 3 while the concentration of nh4 was higher at 15 32 mg l 1 see table s1 which makes in this case the po4 3 the limiting component of the electrochemically precipitated struvite the scaled up batch reactor achieved a remarkable po4 3 removal efficiency of 92 3 from the p ww and between 42 2 48 1 from the municipal wastewater samples while the nh4 removal efficiency was apparently smaller and varied between 12 3 48 9 see table 1 this apparent discrepancy is explained by the initial concentration difference observed for the nh4 which was 4 to 8 times higher than the po4 3 depending on the wastewater sample however based upon their absolute concentration decrease see table s2 the nh4 po4 3 showed a 1 1 removal ratio in most of the wastewater samples tested which is in good agreement with the stoichiometric ratio of struvite the mechanism of electrochemical ammonia removal from wastewater is complicated as it is affected by the electrode material and electrolyte ionic species present in the wastewater matrix yao et al 2016 in addition to precipitation reactions e g struvite formation ammonia can also be removed through oxidative reactions ammonia speciation sits between the molecular and ionic forms where the alkaline ph favors the presence of the molecular form nh3 while neutral and acidic ph favor the presence of the ionic form nh4 based upon the solution ph ammonia can be removed via direct electrooxidation through direct electron transfer ph 9 or indirect oxidation by an oxidation mediator such as cl2 hocl or ocl ph 7 produced on the anode surface zöllig et al 2015 moreover the removal efficiency is affected by the temperature applied current density and the cl concentration for reaction kinetics a pseudo first order rate was reported szpyrkowicz et al 1995 whereas others proposed a pseudo zero kinetics due to the regeneration of cl during electrolysis vanlangendonck et al 2005 for example kim et al found faster degradation of ammonia which was achieved using electro oxidation process in chlorinated aqueous solution under alkaline conditions kim et al 2006 based upon the high phi see table 1 of the f ww sample ammonia removal may have occurred based upon direct electron transfer with minimal by product formation while for p ww and fs ww samples the indirect oxidation via active chlorine was likely to be the main mechanism for ammonia removal it might be expected that if ammonia is being oxidized there would be halogenated by products present in the wastewater composition after electrolysis on the other hand electrochemical ammonia removal in the b ww sample would proceed through an indirect oxidation by active radicals at the start phi 7 9 which could potentially turn into direct electro oxidation phf 10 4 towards the end moreover based upon the main electrochemical reactions see supporting information the localized ph increase near the anode cathode would further produce a shift of ammonium ions to ammonia resulting in nitrogen losses due to ammonia volatilization however it is not possible to completely delineate the ammonia removal mechanisms and this aspect of understanding how the wastewater composition changes with mg driven electrochemical treatment warrants further investigation in future studies intrigued by the initial results we further studied the evolution of ph temperature of the bulk solution po4 3 removal efficiency and po4 3 concentration change over time in the various natural wastewater samples during electrochemical nutrient removal fig 2 as expected the ph showed an increasing trend over time where the largest change was observed at the start of the experiments then reaching a plateau at 15 min in the case of the municipal wastewater samples the ph in the industrial wastewater sample p ww reached a plateau after 1 min fig 2a the temperature showed a steady linear increase over time for all the samples fig 2b the greatest po4 3 removal occurred within 1 min of electrolysis i e 54 in p ww and 14 30 in the municipal wastewater samples fig 2c the ph of the test solution is considered to be a key factor in the po4 3 removal as a result of the po4 3 ions speciation where in alkaline solutions the po4 3 hpo4 2 po4 3 pk a is 12 67 form dominates krȩżel and bal 2004 stoll and blanchard 1990 yan et al 2004 on the other hand in complex matrices such as raw industrial or municipal wastewater sources besides the solution ph other interfering elements may influence the po4 3 removal to a greater extent the po4 3 concentrations versus time during the electrochemical nutrient removal in the various natural wastewater compositions are presented in fig 2d two kinetic regions are evident where fast removal occurs within 1 min and the kinetic relationship for phosphate removal shifts after that time it can also be observed that the po4 3 concentration displays a linear relationship with time between 1 and 30 min suggesting that the reaction follows a zero order kinetic rate law in this region the po4 3 removal rate constants k were obtained for the second kinetic region from the slope and are presented in table 1 where the k values for p ww were 1 3 2 5 units higher than those obtained for the municipal wastewaters based upon the slope of the first kinetic region i e between 0 and 1 min the reaction kinetics are expected to be significantly faster in this initial time frame and could be dependent upon the reactant concentrations the significant decrease in the po4 3 removal kinetics after 1 min could be attributed to the i formation of a mg oh 2 passivating layer and ii bubble formation on the anode surface the formation of the precipitates act as an insulating layer which has an adverse effect on the anode performance i e decreased mg corrosion and decreased nutrient recovery which has been reviewed intensively over the years hug and udert 2013 kékedy nagy et al 2019 2020b kruk et al 2014 normally precipitates cover the mg anode surface forming a passivating layer which act as a second cathode to accelerate mg2 release at first however at some point the passivating layer may reduce the ability of the sacrificial anode to corrode and release mg2 although not captured due to safety reasons during the electrochemical nutrient removal experiments significant bubble formation on the anode surface was visually confirmed indicating possible molecular hydrogen h2 formation based upon the major chemical reactions see supporting information it is expected that alongside nutrient removal h2 production should occur on the anode and cathode surfaces respectively it is expected that the h2 bubbles would further block the mg active sites on the anode surface therefore slowing down the po4 3 removal kinetics after 1 min on the other hand the significant difference in the po4 3 removal efficiency over time and k observed between the p ww and municipal wastewater samples can be attributed to multiple components and their combined effects as described above in particular the presence of cl and nh4 species in p ww disrupt the passivating oxide enabling higher mg corrosion rates and the presence of higher organic carbon content enables ca2 complexation and reduces the effect of ca on struvite precipitation the higher levels of ca2 contributing to the th as expressed in eq 2 in the other three wastewater samples likely delayed struvite nucleation and precipitation overall these different components would have a combined effect in p ww to cause an enhancement in the kinetics of phosphate removal in recent work ge et al showed that the presence of nh4 enhanced mg corrosion in the presence of cl while cai et al elegantly showed during electrochemical nutrient removal the surface of the mg was first oxidized to mgo which transformed into mg oh 2 mgnh4po4 and mgco3 cai et al 2021 ge et al 2021 next we studied the overall composition of the wastewater samples before and after the electrochemical experiments using the scaled up batch reactor in more detail see tables s1 s2 it can be observed that the concentrations of the po4 3 and the nh4 decreased which was associated with the formation of the precipitates observed on the surface of the pure mg anode during the electrochemical nutrient removal experiments the concentration of the major anions and cations present in the wastewater samples before and after the experiments are summarized in fig 3 it can be observed that the k na so4 2 cl and no3 ionic species showed a decrease in their concentrations which could potentially improve the water quality of the effluents on the other hand ca2 showed a slight increase whereas the mg2 ionic species showed a significant increase in their concentrations in all four wastewater samples tested see fig 3 it is expected that the increase in the concentrations of these ionic species would change the conductivity σ of the aqueous solutions as well as the th based on the results the general increase in hardness observed in the wastewater samples can be mainly attributed to the mg2 due to the release of mg2 during anodic corrosion moreover the slight increase in the ca2 concentration in the samples also suggest that little to no ca2 precipitated during the electrochemical nutrient precipitation process the evolution of important water quality parameters such as the conductivity σ total organic carbon toc total dissolved solids tds and total suspended solids tss during the electrochemical nutrient removal experiments are presented in fig 4 and tables s1 s2 the σ showed an increasing trend in all the samples due to the increase in the concentrations of the ca2 and mg2 see fig 3 the most significant change in the σ was observed for the p ww sample with a 254 unit increase followed by fs ww 120 unit and b ww 116 unit while the lowest change was observed for the f ww with only a 30 unit increase see fig 4a interestingly the σ of the respective wastewater matrix had no major influence on the po4 3 and nh4 removal efficiencies respectively the tds showed an increase after the electrochemical experiments as well see fig 4c which may be explained by the significant increase of the mg2 ions in the wastewater effluents due to anodic corrosion as shown in fig 3 the slight increase of ca2 in the wastewater effluents see fig 3 could also have an effect on the tds increase on the other hand it can be observed that the toc and tss showed a decrease in all the wastewater effluents see fig 4b d which demonstrates an improvement of water quality this result suggests that individual water components rather than the total dissolved solids as a whole affect the electrochemical precipitation process the water quality was impacted by the electrochemical nutrient removal process after which the water quality showed an overall improvement however not at the level expected although the various wastewater effluents were characterized by a lower amount of k na so4 2 cl and no3 ionic species while important water quality indicators such as the toc and tss showed a significant removal as well other parameters such as the σ mg2 ca2 and tds showed an increase most importantly the biggest concern is the elevated phf which varied between 9 3 12 1 and is considered high to the accepted level of 6 5 8 5 of surface waters therefore the treated effluents could not be discharged into receiving water bodies these results show that the electrochemical nutrient removal process should be implemented in the wastewater treatment plant process flow as a supplementary step and ph adjustment would be necessary prior to the treated water being discharged 3 2 electrochemistry and corrosion of pure mg in natural wastewaters due to the importance of the corrosion and passivation behavior of mg during electrochemical nutrient removal in complex matrixes such as natural industrial or municipal wastewater sources we decided to further study mg electrode behavior by using a conventional three electrode cell setup as shown in fig 1b as a first step we investigated the electrochemical behavior of a pure mg disk working electrode we by cyclic voltammetry cv not ir corrected in various natural wastewater compositions at a scan rate of 50 mv s 1 and rt fig 5 the figure shows that the obtained full cvs are similar with no major anodic or cathodic peaks observed in the potential window employed indicating electrode passivation electrodeposition or product formation at the electrode surface additionally the increased currents observed in the reverse scans for all the samples would further suggest a dynamic change occurring at the electrode surface during that period fig 5 the mg passivation region where essentially zero current is produced is similar for the three municipal wastewater sources even though the maximum measured current density varies between the three samples however the mg passivation region for the p ww sample is shifted to a more negative potential region as compared to the municipal wastewater sources suggesting that the water composition facilitated a more energetically favorable mg corrosion process and associated current response next we studied the electrochemical behavior of the pure mg discs by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis in the various types of wastewaters where the subsequent nyquist and bode plots are presented in fig 6 the nyquist plots see fig 6a revealed similar capacitance arc shapes or semi circles in all the samples however the semi circle diameter associated with the polarization resistance r p clearly varied with the wastewater composition and showed an increase for the municipal sources see table 2 moreover it can be observed that the uncompensated resistance r u which is associated with the solution resistance is significantly higher in the case of the municipal wastewaters see table 2 this result appears to be correlated to the higher total hardness and the lower chloride ammonium concentrations of the municipal wastewaters as compared to the poultry processing wastewater as the tds of the p ww sample was not high relative to the other wastewater samples see table s1 based upon the obtained r p values the pure mg disk anode showed the lowest corrosion resistance in the p ww sample therefore the pure mg anode is expected to have a higher corrosion rate in the p ww sample since the current corrosion is inversely related to the r p according to the stern geary equation see eq 5 this result aligns with our results in table 1 and fig 2 where the p ww sample results in faster phosphate removal kinetics and larger phosphate removal efficiencies it should be noted that it was difficult to model the semi circles obtained in the nyquist plots fig 6a and not possible to fit a circuit to determine the r p or r u values accurately therefore the reported values shown in table 2 should be considered relative rather than absolute the significant variations at low frequencies observed in the municipal wastewater sources are typically indicative of systems containing significant electrolyte resistance and are obtained for systems where the surface of the anode is undergoing dynamic changes i e molecular hydrogen bubble formation or and solids produced and accumulated on the magnesium surface zhang and zeng 2012 the electrochemical systems presented show non steady state behavior due to changes in electrode properties during the experiment and this non steady state behavior has a significant impact on the stochastic contribution to the error structure of the eis measurements this bias is usually observed most easily at frequencies that require the longest time for measurement and that violate the kramers kronig relations while instrumental artefacts tend to appear at high frequencies due to equipment limitations agarwal et al 1995 orazem 2004 shukla et al 2004 to further understand the effect of the various natural wastewater sources on the mg based disk electrode material the potentiodynamic polarization pdp not ir corrected curves were recorded where the anodic and cathodic branches were generated separately from the corresponding anodic and cathodic lsvs respectively with a cleaning step performed in between each lsv fig 7 shows the tafel plots generated where it can be observed that there is a well developed anodic and cathodic branch respectively however neither branch is characterized by a linear tafel region at high anodic polarization the formation of a passivating layer on the pure mg disk anode in all wastewater sources seemed unavoidable even though all the samples contained cl anions in their natural composition see table s1 which are expected to have a depassivating effect on the oxide layer based upon the polarization curves the municipal wastewater sources produced a more significant passivation layer which could be explained by the higher th i and lower chloride ammonium concentrations see table 1 while the one recoded in p ww shifted to a higher current density region which indicates a higher pitting corrosion occurrence see fig 7 this result confirms our previous findings where the wastewater composition of p ww which included not only higher chloride and ammonium ion concentrations but lower calcium concentration and higher organic carbon concentration appears to have a composition that allows enhanced mg corrosion and less surface passivation the variations in the pdb curves at high voltage are due to the formation of bubbles on the surface of the mg anode which aligns with our conclusion regarding the influence of both the mg oh 2 passivation layer and the formation of h2 gas bubbles at the electrode surface contributing to the shift in measured phosphate removal kinetics the different corrosion parameters such as the corrosion potential e corr the corrosion current i corr the anodic β a or the cathodic β c tafel slopes and the corrosion rate v corr are given in table 2 the obtained anodic β a and cathodic β c tafel slopes see table 2 show a direct correlation with the natural wastewater composition and origin where the slopes generally increased when municipal wastewater sources were used the higher tafel slopes could be explained by the higher th i and lower organic carbon concentration cl and nh4 observed for the municipal wastewaters see table 1 which could have impacted the reaction mechanism s and the overall reaction kinetics of nutrient removal on the other hand due to the complexity of the natural wastewater matrixes used in this study it is expected that slight changes in the composition could have a major impact on the overall reaction kinetics and electron transfer process the pure mg electrode showed an approx 5 7 fold increase in the corrosion rate in the p ww sample compared to the municipal wastewaters these results are in good agreement with the data obtained from the eis fitting where the sacrificial anode showed the lowest corrosion resistance in p ww compared to the other water samples tested see table 2 3 3 precipitate analysis the deposits formed on the anode during the nutrient removal experiments conducted with the scaled up single cell electrochemical batch reactor in the natural wastewater source was further analyzed using various surface characterization techniques scanning electron microscopy sem x ray diffraction xrd energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx to study their structure morphology and chemical composition to eliminate the interfering effects of the mg substrate on the xrd and edx spectra the precipitate was gently removed from the anode surface with a straight razor the high resolution sem image of the precipitate obtained from the p ww sample is presented in fig 8 a and it can be observed that showed a different structure from the high quality struvite obtained in similar conditions in synthetic wastewater composition reported previously by our group kékedy nagy et al 2020a 2019 2020b interestingly the elemental mapping see fig 8b revealed a homogeneous distribution of the significant elements mg o p and n usually present in the electrochemically precipitated struvite composition however the edx spectrum fig 8c displayed two well defined peaks with their respective atomic percentages at for mg 24 25 at and o 72 06 at while the peaks for n 2 54 at and p 1 15 at were significantly smaller finally the xrd pattern fig 8d revealed that the precipitate formed on the anode mainly consisted of magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 and showed only a 3 similarity toward the struvite pattern which is reasonable considering the low p concentrations in the wastewater sources but also may suggest that the p removal followed an alternative mechanism one possibility could be through electrocoagulation involving aluminum al and or iron fe both metals are present in the mg anode composition as impurities n b based upon the vendor s specification al 70 mg l 1 fe 280 mg l 1 and could easily be dislodged dissolved from the anode surface into the wastewater during corrosion the suspended solids e g gravel slit clay sand and algae in the sample might further provide a viable option for p removal by providing surface area for p adsorption and precipitation furthermore although not determined microorganisms and bacteria present in the wastewater could provide an alternative pathway for biological p removal as well the formation of mainly mg oh 2 on the anode surface can be explained by the increased bulk ph of the p ww sample fig 2a moreover an increase in the local ph at the electrode s surface is also expected during the electrolysis as described previously by ben moussa et al ben moussa et al 2006 which would further increase the ph and thus negatively impact the struvite formation in the case of the other wastewater samples the obtained precipitate was so low that it could not be further analyzed however we would not expect a significantly different composition based upon their high ph values measured overall these results show the important role that ph plays in controlling the precipitate s that form and suggest that ph control will be necessary for these electrochemical systems to optimally produce struvite as the primary precipitate further the phosphate is the limiting component for struvite precipitation and due to the higher ammonia concentrations ammonia is likely to remain even if all of the phosphate is removed through struvite precipitation 3 4 economic analysis current efficiency ce has been considered in other studies examining ec water treatment using mg hug and udert 2013 and al brahmi et al 2019 similar to previous works brahmi et al 2019 hug and udert 2013 the ce was found to be greater than 100 across all treatments table 3 where the p ww sample had the lowest ce value of 205 and the b ww sample showing the largest deviation at 461 we note that based upon a literature review of calculation methods and a comparison of experimental and theoretical energy consumption data the primary difference we observe in energy consumption calculations is in the use of experimental versus theoretical mg consumption data not in differences between how overall energy consumption is determined hug and udert offer micro galvanic corrosion release of monovalent mg ions or the chunk effect as possible explanations for their high ce while brahmi et al offered corrosion and anodic oxidation as explanation brahmi et al 2019 hug and udert 2013 there have not been extensive efforts to evaluate differences between theoretical and experimental electrode metal consumption and many studies base the economic assessment solely on a theoretical analysis of measured current densities bayramoglu et al 2007 brahmi et al 2019 espinoza quiñones et al 2009 kobya and demirbas 2015 kobya et al 2016 rodriguez et al 2007 in these cases the current is used to calculate the charge passed and based upon an assumption that all of the charges go to metal corrosion a theoretical metal consumption mass can then be calculated on the other hand our results suggest that this approach can severely underestimate the experimental mass of metal consumed and therefore the estimated materials costs furthermore there are a few studies that compare economic and energy data across wastewater sources and our results demonstrate that the energy consumption varies as a function of wastewater source due to changes in water composition operational costs also varied across treatments and methods of measurement see table 4 when using theoretical methods for measuring electricity and electrode consumption expected costs ranged from 0 08 m 3 to 0 17 m 3 of treated wastewater with expected costs for the p ww treatment being roughly double that of all other treatments however the experimentally measured values showed substantially different results operational costs across all treatments increased with values rising at a minimum of 59 5 for the p ww treatment to a maximum increase of 185 2 for b ww here the treatment of b ww sample was the most expensive with a cost of 0 30 m 3 due to p removal efficiencies varied across treatments it is also useful to consider costs in terms of p removal when viewed from this perspective the p ww treatment is the most cost effective with operational costs of 0 07 kg 1 p removed see fig 9 while theoretical estimates would predict b ww to show costs on par with the p ww treatment experimental results found costs to be 76 4 higher than p ww fig 9 in a comparison to available literature abdel shafy et al estimated operating costs of 0 88 m 3 for the treatment of cooling tower blowdown water using a magnesium rod electrode where they reported a phosphate removal efficiency of 98 0 which is similar to p removal efficiencies seen with the p ww treatment in our studies on the other hand while removal efficiencies were only 5 1 lower operating costs for the p ww treatment were 69 3 less than reported by abdel shafy et al even with lower prices for electricity 0 04 kwh and mg 1 00 kg higher consumption of energy longer electrolysis times and higher consumption of electrode material resulted in higher costs being realized in their study studies utilizing al as the sacrificial material report operating costs ranging from 0 27 m 3 lin et al 2005 to 1 85 m 3 kobya et al 2016 studies utilizing fe as the sacrificial material report operating costs ranging from 0 25 m 3 bayramoglu et al 2007 to 1 70 m 3 espinoza quiñones et al 2009 with experimental costs estimated in this study ranging from 0 19 m 3 to 0 30 m 3 treatment under the conditions tested herein appears to be cost effective in relation to other studies utilizing mg al and fe as a sacrificial material furthermore as the majority of studies appear to use theoretical methods for estimating electrode consumption our evaluation of ce reveals a likelihood that other studies may be underestimating the true costs associated with ec treatment 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the performance of a bench scale electrochemical batch reactor for nutrient removal as well as the electrochemical behavior of pure mg disk electrodes in complex matrixes such as natural industrial or municipal wastewater sources this work assessed the impact of the wastewater chemistry on mg electrode corrosion behavior anodic dissolution of mg and the kinetics and overall efficiency of nutrient removal the scaled up reactor removed up to 54 of the po4 3 present in natural wastewaters within 1 min with an energy input of 0 04 kwh m3 during that reaction time kinetic analysis showed that the po4 3 removal followed a zero order kinetic rate law for t 1 min and the rate constant k depended upon the total hardness th and the levels of cl nh4 and organic carbon present in the solution with an inverse relationship between the rate constant and ca2 ion concentration but a direct correlation between cl and nh4 and the rate constant the sacrificial anode showed the lowest corrosion resistance in the natural industrial wastewater source while in the municipal wastewater sources a general increase in the tafel slope was observed surface characterization of the precipitate formed on the mg anode during electrochemical treatment of p ww indicated that the film obtained on the anode surface was mainly magnesium hydroxide presumed to form due to the increased bulk ph of wastewater source the wastewater chemistry was impacted by the mg2 dissolution where total dissolved solids tds increased in the treated effluents on the other hand an overall improvement of water quality was observed based upon important water quality parameters such as total organic carbon toc total suspended solids tss and turbidity which all showed significant decreases however the electrochemically driven nutrient removal did not produce potable water directly an economic assessment of the electrochemical results resulted in an estimated cost of 0 19 0 30 m 3 based upon experimental mg consumption data comparative results from the economic analysis showed the importance of basing costs on experimental mg consumption data as a theoretical basis is likely to underestimate costs furthermore due to lower treatment times and mg consumption rates the estimated costs of this study are largely lower than those reported in the literature and are competitive with other electrocoagulation processes declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements lkn jp

16366,in this study a suite of natural wastewater sources is tested to understand the effects of wastewater composition and source on electrochemically driven nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient removal kinetics electrode behavior and removal efficiency were evaluated during electrochemical precipitation whereby a sacrificial magnesium mg anode was used to drive precipitation of ammonium and phosphate the electrochemical reactor demonstrated fast kinetics in the natural wastewater matrices removing up to 54 of the phosphate present in natural wastewater within 1 min with an energy input of only 0 04 kwh m 3 after 1 min phosphate removal followed a zero order rate law in the 1 min 30 min range the zero order rate constant k appears to depend upon differences in wastewater composition where a faster rate constant is associated with higher cl and nh4 concentrations lower ca2 concentrations and higher organic carbon content the sacrificial mg anode showed the lowest corrosion resistance in the natural industrial wastewater source with an increased corrosion rate v corr of 15 8 mm y 1 compared to 1 9 3 5 mm y 1 in municipal wastewater sources while the tafel slopes β showed a direct correlation with the natural wastewater composition and origin an overall improvement of water quality was observed where important water quality parameters such as total organic carbon toc total suspended solids tss and turbidity showed a significant decrease an economic analysis revealed costs based upon experimental mg consumption are estimated to range from 0 19 m 3 to 0 30 m 3 but costs based upon theoretical mg consumption range from 0 09 m 3 to 0 18 m 3 overall this study highlights that water chemistry parameters control nutrient recovery while electrochemical treatment does not directly produce potable water and that economic analysis should be based upon experimentally determined mg consumption data synopsis statement magnesium driven electrochemical precipitation of natural wastewater sources enables fast kinetics for phosphate removal at low energy input graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electrochemistry magnesium corrosion natural wastewater nutrient removal 1 introduction agro industrial and municipal wastewater effluents are well known for their high levels of nutrients like phosphorus p nitrogen n or organic matter therefore it is crucial to treat these effluents before they are discharged into receiving water bodies to minimize potential environmental impacts and water quality problems on a global scale rasmussen et al 2018 tilman et al 2011 phosphorus is a non renewable resource where the majority is mined from rock phosphate and its geographic concentration may generate compelling political or economic risks for many countries godfray et al 2010 as the supply of rock phosphate steadily decreases the costs of fertilizers will increase significantly impacting the affordability of food products cordell et al 2009 consequently alternative sources for p should be considered with the emphasis on recyclable or reusable sources from various wastes to facilitate a sustainable global supply of p researchers have shown the possibility to recover p from various waste sources in the form of a precipitate known as struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o or map a white orthorhombic poorly soluble crystal and a premium grade slow

et al 2019b zeng et al 2018 to facilitate electrochemical precipitation a mg based sacrificial anode provides the required amount of mg in the form of mg2 through anodic dissolution corrosion with an applied overpotential η to drive the struvite precipitation reaction the electrochemical behavior of mg based electrodes is complex and still not fully understood controversy still exists about the corrosion and passivation processes of magnesium in general due to the very negative standard reduction potential of the mg mg2 redox couple e mg mg2 2 372 v vs she coates 1945 and non inert material characteristics the anodic dissolution of mg2 in solutions can be best described by a heterogeneous electron transfer coupled with or followed by a homogenous chemical ec reaction although the electrochemical behavior of mg based electrodes has been greatly studied in a wide range of aqueous solutions the water composition has been usually well defined or synthetic and most of these studies have been performed on a bench scale belarbi and trembly 2018 curioni et al 2015 liao et al 2020 liu et al 2019 wu et al 2019 moreover these studies were mainly focused on mg corrosion esmaily et al 2017 p recovery cai et al 2020 struvite production efficiency kékedy nagy et al 2020b and energy input based upon the mg anode type used lei et al 2020 on the other hand systematic studies regarding the general electrochemical behavior of the anode in complex matrixes such as raw industrial or municipal wastewater effluents are still lacking in particular there are a few studies available that compare how the electrochemical system performs across a suite of wastewater sources where a comparison of water chemistry differences is possible due to the wastewater sources being treated by the same electrochemical system and setup in addition detailed studies regarding the impact of electrochemistry on the overall water quality after the electrochemical nutrient removal process by either a single cell batch reactor or a flow reactor have been generally avoided studies have typically focused on the performance of the electrochemical system to remove ammonia and phosphate but have not analyzed a wide range of water chemistry parameters gao et al 2020 lei et al 2019 2021 naresh kumar et al 2019 ren et al 2017 tan et al 2020 wang et al 2019a 2019c our study thus attempts to fill an important knowledge gap on the importance of wastewater source water chemistry in understanding how the mg electrode based electrochemical system performs and the associated effects the water chemistry is expected to have on system optimization finally an economic assessment of the mg electrode driven system is important to consider in the context of overall added cost to a wastewater treatment plant and in comparison to other similar processes in particular it is useful to compare to other electrocoagulation technologies that target coagulation and precipitation of target water components these target water components include heavy metals hardness silica phosphate organics measured as chemical oxygen demand cod or total organic carbon toc and turbidity abdel shafy et al 2020 brahmi et al 2019 espinoza quiñones et al 2009 kobya and demirbas 2015 rodriguez et al 2007 a few studies have evaluated the operating costs for treating wastewater using electrochemical methods with sacrificial anodes consisting of mg abdel shafy et al 2020 hug and udert 2013 however a larger number of studies have examined electrocoagulation systems based on aluminum al bayramoglu et al 2007 brahmi et al 2019 kobya and demirbas 2015 kobya et al 2016 lin et al 2005 rodriguez et al 2007 and iron fe bayramoglu et al 2007 espinoza quiñones et al 2009 inan and alaydın 2014 kobya et al 2016 estimated costs range from 0 25 m 3 to 1 85 m 3 abdel shafy et al 2020 bayramoglu et al 2007 espinoza quiñones et al 2009 kobya et al 2016 a primary difference here in mg driven versus fe or al driven electrocoagulation systems is the treatment goal of nutrient recovery versus the treatment goal of contaminant removal most economic assessments found in the literature are based upon theoretical metal anode consumption estimates which are calculated from the measured cell voltage and current as a function of time both hug and udert 2013 and brahmi et al 2019 however have demonstrated that experimentally determined metal i e mg al consumption can be larger than the theoretical estimate suggesting that cost analyses based upon theoretical consumption likely underestimate the treatment

regions i 0 and 1 min and ii 1 and 30 min were observed the k values are reported for time region ii only as k values for i could not be calculated due to a lack of additional time points the

the electrode material and energy costs kobya et al 2016 in this study the operational costs of the electrochemical process reported as m 3 of treated wastewater were calculated both experimentally and theoretically theoretical calculation is the most commonly used method for estimating input consumption and comparing operational costs in ec studies here we have obtained theoretical values for operating costs by using the following parameters and formulas as referenced in previous literature abdel shafy et al 2020 brahmi et al 2019 7 o p e r a t i n g c o s t a c energy b c electrode where

volume of wastewater treated m3 the experimental energy consumption was measured for the 2 electrode setup using a kill a watt monitor the experimental mg consumption was determined by calculating the total mg measured in the treated wastewater solution plus the amount of mg consumed as a result of phosphate precipitation we note that the experimental mg consumption is an estimate based upon the assumption that all of the phosphate precipitated as struvite it is likely that the experimental mg consumption is an underestimate as results described below suggest that there was also precipitation of magnesium hydroxide species further detailed studies would be necessary to delineate precipitate species the current efficiency ce was calculated by dividing the dissolved mg m mg dissolved by the value expected from the measured current m mg current using the following equation 10 c e m mg dissolved m mg current 100 where ce is the current efficiency m mg dissolved is the mass of the mg

obtained from the integration of the i vs t curve where i is current in a and t is time in s 3 results and discussion 3 1 nutrient removal and water chemistry of natural wastewaters first the practicality of nutrient removal from various natural wastewater sources see section 2 2 using the scaled up electrochemical batch reactor was investigated the reactor s performance along with the bulk ph and total hardness th of the respective wastewater effluent measured prior and after the electrochemical experiments are presented in table 1 the energy input for nutrient removal varied between 0 63 1 25 kwh m 3 and depended upon the wastewater source all compositions exhibited an increase in their respective ph values where the f ww had the highest with a 2 0 unit increase this was followed by the fs ww and b ww with a 1 5 1 2 unit increase respectively while the p ww showed only a 0 4 unit increase in the ph based upon the main electrochemical reactions see supporting information the ph increase of the wastewater effluents promotes the hydrogen evolution reaction her which occurs simultaneously along with the mg2 release based upon the th as expressed in eq 2 the p ww 16 9 mg l 1 caco3 was classified as soft water the fs ww 48 9 mg l 1 caco3 and b ww 56 8 mg l 1 caco3 were both classified as slightly hard waters while the f ww 122 4 mg l 1 caco3 was classified as hard water table 1 see table s1 for ca2 and mg2 concentrations during the electrochemical experiments a significant increase in the th was observed in all the wastewater samples which placed all of them in the hard water classification this increase was caused by release of mg2 from the mg anode along with no measurable ca2 loss through precipitation table s2 this progressive change of the th over time could have a negative impact on the water quality and influence nutrient removal through electrochemical precipitation based upon the complexity of the wastewater effluents multiple water components present table s1 are expected to play a role in nutrient precipitation and phosphate removal kinetics table 1 therefore it is likely that multiple wastewater components contributed to the enhanced phosphate removal observed for p ww fig 2 the presence of cl and nh4 together enhances mg anode corrosion abbasi et al 2017 curioni et al 2016 ge et al 2021 williams and neil mcmurray 2008 and therefore enhances struvite precipitation due to the increased availability of mg2 in solution across the four wastewaters tested p ww has the highest combined concentration of cl and nh4 a finding which is in good agreement with the enhanced phosphate removal kinetics observed for p ww table 1 and fig 2 the ph of the bulk solution and near the mg electrode also plays a role as increasing ph enhances mg oh 2 formation as a passivating film and as a precipitate ph changes ion speciation and therefore change water chemistry effects on both mg corrosion and precipitation in particular the higher initial ph of the f ww sample likely reduced mg corrosion by reducing nh4 speciation and causing enhanced passivation at the mg anode surface in contrast to the effects of cl and nh4 the presence of ca2 may have a negative impact on nutrient precipitation and phosphate removal generally the presence of significant ca2 concentrations i e ratios of ca mg 1 0 may enhance the precipitation of ca2 po4 3 solids therefore further reducing the purity of the electrochemically obtained struvite one way to reduce the interference of ca2 is by adding extra chemicals to chelate the ca2 ions or fix the ph shen et al 2010 zhou et al 2015 however this may lead to an increase in the operating costs and might change the stoichiometry of the wastewater composition in an alternative approach in this study we applied a limited electrolysis time i e 30 min to minimize the precipitation of calcium in the form of hydroxyapatite or amorphous calcium phosphate due to slower reported ca precipitation kinetics lahav et al 2013 the presence of ca2 ions has been shown to slow the kinetics of struvite precipitation by lengthening the induction time to nucleation acelas et al 2015 kabdaszli et al 2006 le corre et al 2005 yan and shih 2016 the work by li et al showed that lower concentrations of ca2 and or lower ca mg molar ratios minimize the impact of ca on struvite precipitation kinetics li et al 2016 suggesting there may be a minimum ca2 concentration ratio threshold for observation of slowed kinetics this threshold requirement is likely a contributing factor in our results where p ww had a larger rate constant for phosphate removal as compared to the other three wastewater samples even though the ca2 varied amongst f ww fs ww and b ww it is also possible that the larger organic carbon content of the p ww wastewater contributed to ca2 complexation which may have reduced the negative effects of ca on nutrient precipitation in the p ww sample rabinovich and rouff 2021 the natural wastewater samples tested contained in general between 3 6 5 6 mg l 1 of po4 3 while the concentration of nh4 was higher at 15 32 mg l 1 see table s1 which makes in this case the po4 3 the limiting component of the electrochemically precipitated struvite the scaled up batch reactor achieved a remarkable po4 3 removal efficiency of 92 3 from the p ww and between 42 2 48 1 from the municipal wastewater samples while the nh4 removal efficiency was apparently smaller and varied between 12 3 48 9 see table 1 this apparent discrepancy is explained by the initial concentration difference observed for the nh4 which was 4 to 8 times higher than the po4 3 depending on the wastewater sample however based upon their absolute concentration decrease see table s2 the nh4 po4 3 showed a 1 1 removal ratio in most of the wastewater samples tested which is in good agreement with the stoichiometric ratio of struvite the mechanism of electrochemical ammonia removal from wastewater is complicated as it is affected by the electrode material and electrolyte ionic species present in the wastewater matrix yao et al 2016 in addition to precipitation reactions e g struvite formation ammonia can also be removed through oxidative reactions ammonia speciation sits between the molecular and ionic forms where the alkaline ph favors the presence of the molecular form nh3 while neutral and acidic ph favor the presence of the ionic form nh4 based upon the solution ph ammonia can be removed via direct electrooxidation through direct electron transfer ph 9 or indirect oxidation by an oxidation mediator such as cl2 hocl or ocl ph 7 produced on the anode surface zöllig et al 2015 moreover the removal efficiency is affected by the temperature applied current density and the cl concentration for reaction kinetics a pseudo first order rate was reported szpyrkowicz et al 1995 whereas others proposed a pseudo zero kinetics due to the regeneration of cl during electrolysis vanlangendonck et al 2005 for example kim et al found faster degradation of ammonia which was achieved using electro oxidation process in chlorinated aqueous solution under alkaline conditions kim et al 2006 based upon the high phi see table 1 of the f ww sample ammonia removal may have occurred based upon direct electron transfer with minimal by product formation while for p ww and fs ww samples the indirect oxidation via active chlorine was likely to be the main mechanism for ammonia removal it might be expected that if ammonia is being oxidized there would be halogenated by products present in the wastewater composition after electrolysis on the other hand electrochemical ammonia removal in the b ww sample would proceed through an indirect oxidation by active radicals at the start phi 7 9 which could potentially turn into direct electro oxidation phf 10 4 towards the end moreover based upon the main electrochemical reactions see supporting information the localized ph increase near the anode cathode would further produce a shift of ammonium ions to ammonia resulting in nitrogen losses due to ammonia volatilization however it is not possible to completely delineate the ammonia removal mechanisms and this aspect of understanding how the wastewater composition changes with mg driven electrochemical treatment warrants further investigation in future studies intrigued by the initial results we further studied the evolution of ph temperature of the bulk solution po4 3 removal efficiency and po4 3 concentration change over time in the various natural wastewater samples during electrochemical nutrient removal fig 2 as expected the ph showed an increasing trend over time where the largest change was observed at the start of the experiments then reaching a plateau at 15 min in the case of the municipal wastewater samples the ph in the industrial wastewater sample p ww reached a plateau after 1 min fig 2a the temperature showed a steady linear increase over time for all the samples fig 2b the greatest po4 3 removal occurred within 1 min of electrolysis i e 54 in p ww and 14 30 in the municipal wastewater samples fig 2c the ph of the test solution is considered to be a key factor in the po4 3 removal as a result of the po4 3 ions speciation where in alkaline solutions the po4 3 hpo4 2 po4 3 pk a is 12 67 form dominates krȩżel and bal 2004 stoll and blanchard 1990 yan et al 2004 on the other hand in complex matrices such as raw industrial or municipal wastewater sources besides the solution ph other interfering elements may influence the po4 3 removal to a greater extent the po4 3 concentrations versus time during the electrochemical nutrient removal in the various natural wastewater compositions are presented in fig 2d two kinetic regions are evident where fast removal occurs within 1 min and the kinetic relationship for phosphate removal shifts after that time it can also be observed that the po4 3 concentration displays a linear relationship with time between 1 and 30 min suggesting that the reaction follows a zero order kinetic rate law in this region the po4 3 removal rate constants k were obtained for the second kinetic region from the slope and are presented in table 1 where the k values for p ww were 1 3 2 5 units higher than those obtained for the municipal wastewaters based upon the slope of the first kinetic region i e between 0 and 1 min the reaction kinetics are expected to be significantly faster in this initial time frame and could be dependent upon the reactant concentrations the significant decrease in the po4 3 removal kinetics after 1 min could be attributed to the i formation of a mg oh 2 passivating layer and ii bubble formation on the anode surface the formation of the precipitates act as an insulating layer which has an adverse effect on the anode performance i e decreased mg corrosion and decreased nutrient recovery which has been reviewed intensively over the years hug and udert 2013 kékedy nagy et al 2019 2020b kruk et al 2014 normally precipitates cover the mg anode surface forming a passivating layer which act as a second cathode to accelerate mg2 release at first however at some point the passivating layer may reduce the ability of the sacrificial anode to corrode and release mg2 although not captured due to safety reasons during the electrochemical nutrient removal experiments significant bubble formation on the anode surface was visually confirmed indicating possible molecular hydrogen h2 formation based upon the major chemical reactions see supporting information it is expected that alongside nutrient removal h2 production should occur on the anode and cathode surfaces respectively it is expected that the h2 bubbles would further block the mg active sites on the anode surface therefore slowing down the po4 3 removal kinetics after 1 min on the other hand the significant difference in the po4 3 removal efficiency over time and k observed between the p ww and municipal wastewater samples can be attributed to multiple components and their combined effects as described above in particular the presence of cl and nh4 species in p ww disrupt the passivating oxide enabling higher mg corrosion rates and the presence of higher organic carbon content enables ca2 complexation and reduces the effect of ca on struvite precipitation the higher levels of ca2 contributing to the th as expressed in eq 2 in the other three wastewater samples likely delayed struvite nucleation and precipitation overall these different components would have a combined effect in p ww to cause an enhancement in the kinetics of phosphate removal in recent work ge et al showed that the presence of nh4 enhanced mg corrosion in the presence of cl while cai et al elegantly showed during electrochemical nutrient removal the surface of the mg was first oxidized to mgo which transformed into mg oh 2 mgnh4po4 and mgco3 cai et al 2021 ge et al 2021 next we studied the overall composition of the wastewater samples before and after the electrochemical experiments using the scaled up batch reactor in more detail see tables s1 s2 it can be observed that the concentrations of the po4 3 and the nh4 decreased which was associated with the formation of the precipitates observed on the surface of the pure mg anode during the electrochemical nutrient removal experiments the concentration of the major anions and cations present in the wastewater samples before and after the experiments are summarized in fig 3 it can be observed that the k na so4 2 cl and no3 ionic species showed a decrease in their concentrations which could potentially improve the water quality of the effluents on the other hand ca2 showed a slight increase whereas the mg2 ionic species showed a significant increase in their concentrations in all four wastewater samples tested see fig 3 it is expected that the increase in the concentrations of these ionic species would change the conductivity σ of the aqueous solutions as well as the th based on the results the general increase in hardness observed in the wastewater samples can be mainly attributed to the mg2 due to the release of mg2 during anodic corrosion moreover the slight increase in the ca2 concentration in the samples also suggest that little to no ca2 precipitated during the electrochemical nutrient precipitation process the evolution of important water quality parameters such as the conductivity σ total organic carbon toc total dissolved solids tds and total suspended solids tss during the electrochemical nutrient removal experiments are presented in fig 4 and tables s1 s2 the σ showed an increasing trend in all the samples due to the increase in the concentrations of the ca2 and mg2 see fig 3 the most significant change in the σ was observed for the p ww sample with a 254 unit increase followed by fs ww 120 unit and b ww 116 unit while the lowest change was observed for the f ww with only a 30 unit increase see fig 4a interestingly the σ of the respective wastewater matrix had no major influence on the po4 3 and nh4 removal efficiencies respectively the tds showed an increase after the electrochemical experiments as well see fig 4c which may be explained by the significant increase of the mg2 ions in the wastewater effluents due to anodic corrosion as shown in fig 3 the slight increase of ca2 in the wastewater effluents see fig 3 could also have an effect on the tds increase on the other hand it can be observed that the toc and tss showed a decrease in all the wastewater effluents see fig 4b d which demonstrates an improvement of water quality this result suggests that individual water components rather than the total dissolved solids as a whole affect the electrochemical precipitation process the water quality was impacted by the electrochemical nutrient removal process after which the water quality showed an overall improvement however not at the level expected although the various wastewater effluents were characterized by a lower amount of k na so4 2 cl and no3 ionic species while important water quality indicators such as the toc and tss showed a significant removal as well other parameters such as the σ mg2 ca2 and tds showed an increase most importantly the biggest concern is the elevated phf which varied between 9 3 12 1 and is considered high to the accepted level of 6 5 8 5 of surface waters therefore the treated effluents could not be discharged into receiving water bodies these results show that the electrochemical nutrient removal process should be implemented in the wastewater treatment plant process flow as a supplementary step and ph adjustment would be necessary prior to the treated water being discharged 3 2 electrochemistry and corrosion of pure mg in natural wastewaters due to the importance of the corrosion and passivation behavior of mg during electrochemical nutrient removal in complex matrixes such as natural industrial or municipal wastewater sources we decided to further study mg electrode behavior by using a conventional three electrode cell setup as shown in fig 1b as a first step we investigated the electrochemical behavior of a pure mg disk working electrode we by cyclic voltammetry cv not ir corrected in various natural wastewater compositions at a scan rate of 50 mv s 1 and rt fig 5 the figure shows that the obtained full cvs are similar with no major anodic or cathodic peaks observed in the potential window employed indicating electrode passivation electrodeposition or product formation at the electrode surface additionally the increased currents observed in the reverse scans for all the samples would further suggest a dynamic change occurring at the electrode surface during that period fig 5 the mg passivation region where essentially zero current is produced is similar for the three municipal wastewater sources even though the maximum measured current density varies between the three samples however the mg passivation region for the p ww sample is shifted to a more negative potential region as compared to the municipal wastewater sources suggesting that the water composition facilitated a more energetically favorable mg corrosion process and associated current response next we studied the electrochemical behavior of the pure mg discs by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis in the various types of wastewaters where the subsequent nyquist and bode plots are presented in fig 6 the nyquist plots see fig 6a revealed similar capacitance arc shapes or semi circles in all the samples however the semi circle diameter associated with the polarization resistance r p clearly varied with the wastewater composition and showed an increase for the municipal sources see table 2 moreover it can be observed that the uncompensated resistance r u which is associated with the solution resistance is significantly higher in the case of the municipal wastewaters see table 2 this result appears to be correlated to the higher total hardness and the lower chloride ammonium concentrations of the municipal wastewaters as compared to the poultry processing wastewater as the tds of the p ww sample was not high relative to the other wastewater samples see table s1 based upon the obtained r p values the pure mg disk anode showed the lowest corrosion resistance in the p ww sample therefore the pure mg anode is expected to have a higher corrosion rate in the p ww sample since the current corrosion is inversely related to the r p according to the stern geary equation see eq 5 this result aligns with our results in table 1 and fig 2 where the p ww sample results in faster phosphate removal kinetics and larger phosphate removal efficiencies it should be noted that it was difficult to model the semi circles obtained in the nyquist plots fig 6a and not possible to fit a circuit to determine the r p or r u values accurately therefore the reported values shown in table 2 should be considered relative rather than absolute the significant variations at low frequencies observed in the municipal wastewater sources are typically indicative of systems containing significant electrolyte resistance and are obtained for systems where the surface of the anode is undergoing dynamic changes i e molecular hydrogen bubble formation or and solids produced and accumulated on the magnesium surface zhang and zeng 2012 the electrochemical systems presented show non steady state behavior due to changes in electrode properties during the experiment and this non steady state behavior has a significant impact on the stochastic contribution to the error structure of the eis measurements this bias is usually observed most easily at frequencies that require the longest time for measurement and that violate the kramers kronig relations while instrumental artefacts tend to appear at high frequencies due to equipment limitations agarwal et al 1995 orazem 2004 shukla et al 2004 to further understand the effect of the various natural wastewater sources on the mg based disk electrode material the potentiodynamic polarization pdp not ir corrected curves were recorded where the anodic and cathodic branches were generated separately from the corresponding anodic and cathodic lsvs respectively with a cleaning step performed in between each lsv fig 7 shows the tafel plots generated where it can be observed that there is a well developed anodic and cathodic branch respectively however neither branch is characterized by a linear tafel region at high anodic polarization the formation of a passivating layer on the pure mg disk anode in all wastewater sources seemed unavoidable even though all the samples contained cl anions in their natural composition see table s1 which are expected to have a depassivating effect on the oxide layer based upon the polarization curves the municipal wastewater sources produced a more significant passivation layer which could be explained by the higher th i and lower chloride ammonium concentrations see table 1 while the one recoded in p ww shifted to a higher current density region which indicates a higher pitting corrosion occurrence see fig 7 this result confirms our previous findings where the wastewater composition of p ww which included not only higher chloride and ammonium ion concentrations but lower calcium concentration and higher organic carbon concentration appears to have a composition that allows enhanced mg corrosion and less surface passivation the variations in the pdb curves at high voltage are due to the formation of bubbles on the surface of the mg anode which aligns with our conclusion regarding the influence of both the mg oh 2 passivation layer and the formation of h2 gas bubbles at the electrode surface contributing to the shift in measured phosphate removal kinetics the different corrosion parameters such as the corrosion potential e corr the corrosion current i corr the anodic β a or the cathodic β c tafel slopes and the corrosion rate v corr are given in table 2 the obtained anodic β a and cathodic β c tafel slopes see table 2 show a direct correlation with the natural wastewater composition and origin where the slopes generally increased when municipal wastewater sources were used the higher tafel slopes could be explained by the higher th i and lower organic carbon concentration cl and nh4 observed for the municipal wastewaters see table 1 which could have impacted the reaction mechanism s and the overall reaction kinetics of nutrient removal on the other hand due to the complexity of the natural wastewater matrixes used in this study it is expected that slight changes in the composition could have a major impact on the overall reaction kinetics and electron transfer process the pure mg electrode showed an approx 5 7 fold increase in the corrosion rate in the p ww sample compared to the municipal wastewaters these results are in good agreement with the data obtained from the eis fitting where the sacrificial anode showed the lowest corrosion resistance in p ww compared to the other water samples tested see table 2 3 3 precipitate analysis the deposits formed on the anode during the nutrient removal experiments conducted with the scaled up single cell electrochemical batch reactor in the natural wastewater source was further analyzed using various surface characterization techniques scanning electron microscopy sem x ray diffraction xrd energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx to study their structure morphology and chemical composition to eliminate the interfering effects of the mg substrate on the xrd and edx spectra the precipitate was gently removed from the anode surface with a straight razor the high resolution sem image of the precipitate obtained from the p ww sample is presented in fig 8 a and it can be observed that showed a different structure from the high quality struvite obtained in similar conditions in synthetic wastewater composition reported previously by our group kékedy nagy et al 2020a 2019 2020b interestingly the elemental mapping see fig 8b revealed a homogeneous distribution of the significant elements mg o p and n usually present in the electrochemically precipitated struvite composition however the edx spectrum fig 8c displayed two well defined peaks with their respective atomic percentages at for mg 24 25 at and o 72 06 at while the peaks for n 2 54 at and p 1 15 at were significantly smaller finally the xrd pattern fig 8d revealed that the precipitate formed on the anode mainly consisted of magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 and showed only a 3 similarity toward the struvite pattern which is reasonable considering the low p concentrations in the wastewater sources but also may suggest that the p removal followed an alternative mechanism one possibility could be through electrocoagulation involving aluminum al and or iron fe both metals are present in the mg anode composition as impurities n b based upon the vendor s specification al 70 mg l 1 fe 280 mg l 1 and could easily be dislodged dissolved from the anode surface into the wastewater during corrosion the suspended solids e g gravel slit clay sand and algae in the sample might further provide a viable option for p removal by providing surface area for p adsorption and precipitation furthermore although not determined microorganisms and bacteria present in the wastewater could provide an alternative pathway for biological p removal as well the formation of mainly mg oh 2 on the anode surface can be explained by the increased bulk ph of the p ww sample fig 2a moreover an increase in the local ph at the electrode s surface is also expected during the electrolysis as described previously by ben moussa et al ben moussa et al 2006 which would further increase the ph and thus negatively impact the struvite formation in the case of the other wastewater samples the obtained precipitate was so low that it could not be further analyzed however we would not expect a significantly different composition based upon their high ph values measured overall these results show the important role that ph plays in controlling the precipitate s that form and suggest that ph control will be necessary for these electrochemical systems to optimally produce struvite as the primary precipitate further the phosphate is the limiting component for struvite precipitation and due to the higher ammonia concentrations ammonia is likely to remain even if all of the phosphate is removed through struvite precipitation 3 4 economic analysis current efficiency ce has been considered in other studies examining ec water treatment using mg hug and udert 2013 and al brahmi et al 2019 similar to previous works brahmi et al 2019 hug and udert 2013 the ce was found to be greater than 100 across all treatments table 3 where the p ww sample had the lowest ce value of 205 and the b ww sample showing the largest deviation at 461 we note that based upon a literature review of calculation methods and a comparison of experimental and theoretical energy consumption data the primary difference we observe in energy consumption calculations is in the use of experimental versus theoretical mg consumption data not in differences between how overall energy consumption is determined hug and udert offer micro galvanic corrosion release of monovalent mg ions or the chunk effect as possible explanations for their high ce while brahmi et al offered corrosion and anodic oxidation as explanation brahmi et al 2019 hug and udert 2013 there have not been extensive efforts to evaluate differences between theoretical and experimental electrode metal consumption and many studies base the economic assessment solely on a theoretical analysis of measured current densities bayramoglu et al 2007 brahmi et al 2019 espinoza quiñones et al 2009 kobya and demirbas 2015 kobya et al 2016 rodriguez et al 2007 in these cases the current is used to calculate the charge passed and based upon an assumption that all of the charges go to metal corrosion a theoretical metal consumption mass can then be calculated on the other hand our results suggest that this approach can severely underestimate the experimental mass of metal consumed and therefore the estimated materials costs furthermore there are a few studies that compare economic and energy data across wastewater sources and our results demonstrate that the energy consumption varies as a function of wastewater source due to changes in water composition operational costs also varied across treatments and methods of measurement see table 4 when using theoretical methods for measuring electricity and electrode consumption expected costs ranged from 0 08 m 3 to 0 17 m 3 of treated wastewater with expected costs for the p ww treatment being roughly double that of all other treatments however the experimentally measured values showed substantially different results operational costs across all treatments increased with values rising at a minimum of 59 5 for the p ww treatment to a maximum increase of 185 2 for b ww here the treatment of b ww sample was the most expensive with a cost of 0 30 m 3 due to p removal efficiencies varied across treatments it is also useful to consider costs in terms of p removal when viewed from this perspective the p ww treatment is the most cost effective with operational costs of 0 07 kg 1 p removed see fig 9 while theoretical estimates would predict b ww to show costs on par with the p ww treatment experimental results found costs to be 76 4 higher than p ww fig 9 in a comparison to available literature abdel shafy et al estimated operating costs of 0 88 m 3 for the treatment of cooling tower blowdown water using a magnesium rod electrode where they reported a phosphate removal efficiency of 98 0 which is similar to p removal efficiencies seen with the p ww treatment in our studies on the other hand while removal efficiencies were only 5 1 lower operating costs for the p ww treatment were 69 3 less than reported by abdel shafy et al even with lower prices for electricity 0 04 kwh and mg 1 00 kg higher consumption of energy longer electrolysis times and higher consumption of electrode material resulted in higher costs being realized in their study studies utilizing al as the sacrificial material report operating costs ranging from 0 27 m 3 lin et al 2005 to 1 85 m 3 kobya et al 2016 studies utilizing fe as the sacrificial material report operating costs ranging from 0 25 m 3 bayramoglu et al 2007 to 1 70 m 3 espinoza quiñones et al 2009 with experimental costs estimated in this study ranging from 0 19 m 3 to 0 30 m 3 treatment under the conditions tested herein appears to be cost effective in relation to other studies utilizing mg al and fe as a sacrificial material furthermore as the majority of studies appear to use theoretical methods for estimating electrode consumption our evaluation of ce reveals a likelihood that other studies may be underestimating the true costs associated with ec treatment 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the performance of a bench scale electrochemical batch reactor for nutrient removal as well as the electrochemical behavior of pure mg disk electrodes in complex matrixes such as natural industrial or municipal wastewater sources this work assessed the impact of the wastewater chemistry on mg electrode corrosion behavior anodic dissolution of mg and the kinetics and overall efficiency of nutrient removal the scaled up reactor removed up to 54 of the po4 3 present in natural wastewaters within 1 min with an energy input of 0 04 kwh m3 during that reaction time kinetic analysis showed that the po4 3 removal followed a zero order kinetic rate law for t 1 min and the rate constant k depended upon the total hardness th and the levels of cl nh4 and organic carbon present in the solution with an inverse relationship between the rate constant and ca2 ion concentration but a direct correlation between cl and nh4 and the rate constant the sacrificial anode showed the lowest corrosion resistance in the natural industrial wastewater source while in the municipal wastewater sources a general increase in the tafel slope was observed surface characterization of the precipitate formed on the mg anode during electrochemical treatment of p ww indicated that the film obtained on the anode surface was mainly magnesium hydroxide presumed to form due to the increased bulk ph of wastewater source the wastewater chemistry was impacted by the mg2 dissolution where total dissolved solids tds increased in the treated effluents on the other hand an overall improvement of water quality was observed based upon important water quality parameters such as total organic carbon toc total suspended solids tss and turbidity which all showed significant decreases however the electrochemically driven nutrient removal did not produce potable water directly an economic assessment of the electrochemical results resulted in an estimated cost of 0 19 0 30 m 3 based upon experimental mg consumption data comparative results from the economic analysis showed the importance of basing costs on experimental mg consumption data as a theoretical basis is likely to underestimate costs furthermore due to lower treatment times and mg consumption rates the estimated costs of this study are largely lower than those reported in the literature and are competitive with other electrocoagulation processes declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements lkn jp

dbpfp 1 introduction the safety of the drinking water supply has long been a major issue of social concern drinking water distribution systems dwdss are constructed and maintained for delivering product water to users water produced by drinking water treatment plants dwtps that meets standards can still lead to secondary pollution during the long distance transmission of dwdss waller et al 2018 the continuous increase of unremoved natural organic matter nom makes biofilm formation ubiquitous in dwdss which could result in the secondary pollution of drinking water and pose a threat to the safety of water quality and to human health mian et al 2018 li et al 2019c the pipe wall biofilms are mainly composed of microorganisms corrosion products and inorganic deposits the bacterial community encapsulated by extracellular polymeric substance eps typically accounts for more than 90 of the total biomass of water supply pipelines wang et al 2013a as an external matrix eps mainly secreted by biofilm cells account for 80 of hydrated biofilms and are mostly composed of proteins and polysaccharides that play an essential role in adhesion protection intracellular communication and nutrient retention perez et al 2017 hu et al 2020 flemming et al 2010 the characteristics of eps enable pipe wall microorganisms to adapt to adverse environments with low concentrations of nutrients and free disinfectants however the eps of pipe wall biofilms have not been extensively investigated due to limited access to dwdss disinfection is an efficacious measure broadly applied to control microbial stability in dwdss due to its cost effectiveness and practicality chlorine is the most commonly used disinfectant or oxidant for water treatment processes however an indispensable concern of disinfection is the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps which have been frequently detected in water supply pipelines and at points of use ao et al 2019 ding et al 2019 yu et al 2019 thus far more than 700 kinds of dbps have been found in drinking water and most exhibit carcinogenicity teratogenicity and mutagenicity cai et al 2018 in general emerging nitrogenous dbps n dbps e g haloacetonitriles hans and haloacetamides hacams are produced at relatively low concentrations but have more toxicological effects than currently regulated carbonaceous dbps c dbps e g trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas zhang et al 2020 despite significant knowledge of the formation of dbps in dwtps where water quality parameters and dbp yields could be monitored simultaneously the formation of dbps in dwdss is not well understood due to the complex environments and interactions occurring within pipelines more recently researchers have turned their interest to nonnegligible dbp precursors other than noms such as biofilm materials that are commonly rich in nitrogen and have a lower molecular weight than noms biofilms show better resistance than planktonic microbial cells in water so they can survive even under continuous exposure to disinfectants serving as reservoirs for dbp precursors li et al 2020a given the persistence of pipe wall biofilms and current operational responses to biofilm outbreaks during water supply which include increasing the concentration of residual disinfectants to eradicate biological risk biofilm cells and eps may be crucial contributors to dbp formation in dwdss previous studies have demonstrated that biofilm materials could react with disinfectants generating undesirable dbps in dwdss chen 2020 tommaso et al 2019 fisher et al 2017 abokifa et al 2016 it has been reported that pipe wall biofilms cultured in filtered water have greater potential for thms generation than filtered water after 48 h of reaction at a chlorine concentration of 4 mg l xu et al 2018 under the chlor am ination of mature biofilms developed in desalinated seawater eps showed higher dbp yields than biofilm cells and polysaccharides were considered more likely to be the primary dbp precursors of the eps matrix wang and hu 2018 in addition the proteins of biofilm eps can be chlorine consumers and humic substance aggregators perez and susa 2017 another previous study elucidated that under the catalysis of copper corrosion products the formation capacity of c dbps and n dbps in the eps proteins was much higher than that in polysaccharides hu et al 2020 materials used in the actual construction of water utility pipelines vary leading to significant differences in pipe wall biofilms zhang et al 2017 therefore close attention should be given to the pipe material as a key influencing factor of the dbp formation of biofilms since biofilms are heterogeneous their physical characteristics e g thickness surface roughness porosity and biomass density are intrinsic elements that will remarkably affect disinfectant transport and penetration li et al 2020a different pipe materials can result in not only different physical characteristics of biofilms bimakr et al 2018 but also discrepant compositions of biological populations zhang et al 2017 douterelo et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 further causing distinct types and contents of dbp precursors within pipe wall biofilms lehtola et al 2004 however the effect of pipe materials on the contribution of pipe wall biofilms generating dbps under the same chlorination conditions is not well known especially for n dbps and no literature has evaluated the toxicological effects of dbp formation with biofilm materials as precursors considering that ductile iron or cement lined pipe materials are widely used in practical applications this experiment selected ductile iron pipes cement lined stainless steel pipes and pe pipes as the test objects in the present study biofilm reactors containing pipe coupons were used to explore the physical and biological characteristics of biofilms formed on different pipe materials firstly then the contribution of biofilms including cells and eps to dbp yields during chlorination was investigated moreover to prevent the influence of low concentrations of certain dbps with high toxicity it was necessary to evaluate the comprehensive toxicity risk of disinfection thus an integrated understanding of differences in dbp formation from biofilms on different pipe materials and of related health threats helped develop control strategies for the harm of biofilms in dwdss providing new knowledge for assessing pipe materials the results of these experiments were obtained from biofilms grown on coupons in reactors under laboratory conditions similar experiments need to be conducted on biofilms grown on coupons inserted in actual pipes to confirm whether similar conclusions can be made regarding biofilms developed under field conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 model setup for biofilm incubation biofilm annular reactors bars model 1320lj biosurface technologies co usa were applied to simulate the dwds fig 1 showed the experimental setup of the reactor system the reactors were operated in a dwtp with taihu lake as source water and inoculated using water effluents treated by screening coagulation flocculation sedimentation gac adsorption and fast sand before disinfection table s1 the filtered water which was the effluent after the carbon filter was used as the blank control group and as the feed water for the cultivation of the biofilms in reactors each bar consisted of two concentric glass cylinders and one rotating inner drum cylinder with twenty flush mounted removable coupons each coupon offered an exposed surface area of 17 5 cm2 for biofilm growth a variable speed motor located above the reactor controls the rotation of the drum which in turn adjusted the shear stress on the outer cylinder wall according to previous studies li et al 2019a ding et al 2019 the rotational speed of inner drum cylinder was fixed at 50 rpm to provide a shear stress of 0 25 n m2 and laminar flow the hydraulic residence time was 6 h as determined by a flow rate of 2 7 ml min to eliminate light all nonopaque exposed surfaces were covered with aluminum foil the bars ran at 25 0 0 5 c for over 1 year as a sufficiently long period previously found to enable to biofilms to reach equilibrium stoodley et al 1999 gomes et al 2014 among the pipe materials applied for the mains of dwdss ductile iron di pipes and stainless steel ss pipes are commonly employed due to the convenient handling and installation there are increased concerns over polyethylene pe pipes therefore of the nine reactors in parallel there were three bars equipped with di ss and pe coupons to simulate different pipe materials prior to biofilm development the bars were disinfected as described in text s1 2 2 sample collection extraction and analysis water samples were collected from feed water and reactor effluents every two days and were tested immediately after filtration through a 0 45 μm glass fiber membrane gf f whatman uk the test methods and details of the basic water quality parameters were presented in text s2 and table s2 the bars were disassembled and di ss and pe coupons were aseptically removed before biofilm sampling each coupon was slightly washed with sterile phosphate buffer solution pbs to remove planktonic bacteria thereafter the coupons were drawn using sterile cotton swabs feazel et al 2009 the swabs were subsequently broken and placed in a sterile tube containing sterile pbs the tube was then vortexed for 2 min and the swabs were removed the suspension with biofilms was filtered with 0 20 µm filters gttp millipore usa the procedure for collecting biofilm formed on each coupon material was actualized in triplicate for eps extraction a modified cation exchange resin method with low cell lysis and high eps extraction efficiency was adopted chen 2021 wang et al 2020 wen et al 2020 liang et al 2010 the biofilm suspension

mixture was centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 20 min and the supernatant was filtered by 0 45 μm membranes two major components of the eps matrix proteins and polysaccharides were extracted and quantified separately bicinchoninic acid protein assay was used for proteins wang et al 2018 walker et al 2002 and phenol sulfuric acid method was applied for polysaccharides wang et al 2018 nielsen et al 2010

obtained from sigma aldrich usa disinfectants applied in chlorination and chloramination were free chlorine and monochloramine respectively krasner et al 2012 chu et al 2012b free chlorine stock solution was obtained from sodium hypochlorite solution monochloramine stock solution was prepared daily through the reaction of sodium hypochlorite solution and ammonium chloride solution at a molar ratio of 1 4 the specific chlorination preparation and dbp analysis methods used were shown in text s5 as the contents of organic compounds and dbp precursors in each eps matrix extracted from biofilms on di ss and pe coupons were not necessarily identical the yield of dbp was defined in µg mg c according to eq 1 to characterize the amount of precursors in a unit mass of biofilm organics 1 dbp yield μ g mg c formed dbp concentration initial toc of biofilm solution prepared disinfectant solutions were stored using brown bottles in the shadow to avoid photo degradation the disinfectant concentrations and the residue levels of free chlorine and monochloramine were tested according to the indophenol method using a portable colorimeter dr 890 hach usa and powder pillows of freechlor f reagent and monochlor f reagent it is well recognised sathasivan et al 2020 that c dbp formation is strongly linearly related to the chlorine consumed in real water samples the tthm yield during the period of linearity with the chlorine demand chlorine consumption could be obtained by the following eq 2 2 c t t h m α t t h m c c l 0 c f o t h 0 c l c l c t t h m 0 where ccl 0 was the initial concentration of chlorine ctthm 0 was the concentration of tthm before primary chlorination cf oth 0 the x intercept could be obtained by dividing the constant by the slope to examine and compare the dbp formation from biofilm eps on different coupon materials biofilm solutions 1 5 mg c l and eps matrix harvested from corresponding biofilm solutions were performed to react with disinfectants at ph 7 0 for 24 h based on pre experiments the initial dosages of chlor am ine were 3 0 mg l which were measured to achieve the residue disinfectants in a range from 0 3 to 1 0 mg l the experiments of dbp formation were conducted with 100 ml amber bottles in the dark at 25 0 0 5 c ascorbic acid was subsequently adopted to quench the disinfectant residuals basic chemicals were purchased from nanjing chemical reagent co ltd china all solutions were prepared with ultrapure water produced from a millipore filtration system usa experimental bottles were rinsed three times with ultrapure water and then dried in an oven at 105 c for 24 h each chlor am ination experiment was actualized in triplicate 2 5 integrated toxicity evaluation mammalian chinese hamster ovary cho cells are widely used in toxicology research as experimental animal cells methods for the detection of the effective dose of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity involved in the additive model to evaluate dbp toxicity risk have been used in other studies postigo et al 2018 wagner et al 2017 the lc50 value as the dbp concentration calculated by regression analysis that induced a cell density that was 50 of the negative control corresponded to cytotoxic equivalent concentrations the cho cell genotoxicity test was based on the comparison of genotoxicity endpoints using single cell gel electrophoresis scge the scge 50 tail dna value was used as the primary metric to compare the genotoxic potency for each dbp the relevant model and values were presented in text s6 and table s3 2 6 statistics analysis the tests were conducted in triplicate results were expressed as mean standard analysis of variance anova was used to compare the results and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant the data were analyzed by spss version 20 0 ibm usa and origin 9 0 origin lab usa relative standard deviation was typified by error bars 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphological characteristics of biofilms overtime fig s1 the growth of biofilms on different coupons basically showed a logarithmic growth trend in the initial stage and then the growth rate gradually slowed and finally stabilized sem was used to observe the three dimensional morphological characteristics of the biofilm surfaces and the degree of crosslinking the sem observation results were shown in fig 2 at corresponding magnifications of 500 3000 and 10 000 times fig 2 showed that the biofilm density and thickness of different coupon wall biofilms were ordered as follows di coupon biofilm ss coupon biofilm pe coupon biofilm which were consistent with the trend of biofilm biomass this result clearly indicateed that the di coupon biofilm had a more complex and developed structure than the other two coupon wall biofilms fig 2a b at the same time the rich zoogloea and eps better promoted cross linking between the biofilms showing that the di coupon biofilm contained more organic components that can be used as the precursors of dbps as shown in fig 2c the biofilms on the walls of different coupons had some morphological structures similar to those of holes and trenches collectively referred to as pore channels these structures promoted the growth and development of coupon wall biofilms according to observations the pore channels of the di and ss coupon biofilms were more compact than those of the pe coupon biofilms to a certain extent the densest pore channels and eps wrap protection of di coupon biofilms can prevent the disinfectant in water from easily penetrating and killing biofilm cells directly also making it difficult to clearly observe a single cell body however individual cells were relatively easy to identify on the pe coupon biofilms and many directly exposed cells were found in general bacilli and cocci were the types of microorganisms most widely found in the three pipe wall biofilms wang et al 2015 and morphological differences between microorganisms were not significant 3 2 multiple fluorescent staining and clsm imaging fig 3 showed the fluorescent staining results of viable and dead bacteria identified from different coupon wall biofilms through observation it was found that the mature coupon wall biofilms of the three kinds of coupon materials had a certain thickness and the stacking and density of microbial cells were ordered as follows di coupon biofilm ss coupon biofilm pe coupon biofilm consistent with the above growth regularities and the results of sem observation mature coupon wall biofilm cells were dominated by viable bacteria and some dead bacteria also appeared table s4 di coupon biofilms had the most viable bacteria with green fluorescent intensity levels 24 9 and 57 0 higher than those of ss coupon and pe coupon biofilms respectively viable bacteria can play a microbial mediated role in degrading organic matter in water and generating new metabolites including dbp precursors providing more precursors for the formation of dbps conversely dead bacteria do not have this active function therefore to a certain extent the more viable bacteria there are in coupon wall biofilms under the same culture conditions the more potential for dbp generation there is the relative spatial distribution of protein and polysaccharide content was described by fluorescent intensity per unit of volume table s5 protein and α polysaccharide levels were ordered as follows di coupon biofilm ss coupon biofilm pe coupon biofilm table s6 and the β polysaccharide content was ordered as follows pe coupon biofilm di coupon biofilm ss coupon biofilm in addition the proportions of polysaccharides were greater than those of protein fig s2 in the three pipe biofilms wang et al 2018 3 3 community diversity the illumina miseq pe300 gene sequencing platform was used to carry out high throughput sequencing li et al 2020b for the wall biofilms of the di ss and pe coupons and the selected high quality 16s rrna sequences were clustered with 97 gene similarity to obtain the otu analysis of each sample rehman et al 2020 oh et al 2018 li et al 2019b a total of 1654 1421 and 1150 otus were found in the biofilms from the di pe and ss coupons respectively to compare the alpha diversity levels of the coupon biofilm microorganisms the diversity index shannon simpson and richness index ace chao1 were calculated table s7 a comparison of the shannon and simpson indices showed that species diversity levels ranked in the following order di coupon biofilm ss coupon biofilm pe coupon biofilm table s7 a comparison of the ace and chao1 indices also showed that the species richness of pe coupons was the lowest while that of di coupons was slightly higher than that of ss coupons table s7 the species diversity and richness of the three different coupon biofilms were largely consistent with the biomass trend which may be attributed to the roughness of the inner wall of the di coupons and the protection of the corrosion scale layer which created an conducive growth and reproduction environment for the internal microorganisms according to the results of the otu analysis and classification by the rdp classifier 107 classes and 585 genera were detected in the di coupons 93 classes and 573 genera were detected in the ss coupons and 89 classes and 554 genera were detected in the pe coupons respectively fig 4 a in addition 77 and 451 bacterial classes and genera were respectively common among the three kinds of coupon biofilms fig 4b in the di and ss coupon biofilms alphaproteobacteria 24 77 and gammaproteobacteria 21 17 were the main bacteria revetta et al 2013 lautenschlager et al 2013 indicating that these two proteobacteria exhibited strong adaptability and broad ubiquity the dominant bacteria in the di and ss coupon biofilms were similar but the relative abundance distributions of species differed in contrast the relative abundances of thermoleophilia 19 05 and saccharimonadia 18 12 in pe coupon biofilm microorganisms were more prominent fig 4c at the genus level the community structures of biofilm microorganisms in the three kinds of coupon walls also varied the results given in the heatmap chart showed that the dominant bacterial genera and relative abundance distributions of the three coupons were completely different fig s3 the results showed that norank f norank o saccharimonadales norank f 67 14 hyphomicrobium methylibium and candidatus tenderia had significant differences p 0 05 corresponding to the dominant bacterial genera of different coupon biofilms shown in fig s4 these significant differences indicate that these five types of bacteria can describe to a certain extent the species differences of microorganisms on coupon wall biofilms hemdan et al 2019 of di ss and pe coupons fig s3 3 4 dbp formation potential as the organic matter composition and dbp precursor content on the three kinds of coupon wall biofilms of di ss and pe coupons with the same coupon area varied the dbpfp of each coupon wall biofilm was divided by its corresponding doc value of organic matter to determine the content of dbp precursor in the unit mass of organic matter which was called the unit dbp formation potential of the coupon wall biofilms dbpfp0 the higher the density of dbp precursors in the biofilm of a certain water supply coupon is the greater the potential threat to the effluent water becomes it is worth explaining that dbps were significantly different due to the disinfectant types trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas dichloroacetamide dcacam dichloroacetonitrile dcan and trichloronitromethane tcnm were observed during the chlorination however only trihalomethanes thms and tcnm were detected during the chloramination the c dbps concentration from chlorination was 6 4 times higher than that from chloramination while the n dbps concentration from chloramination was 2 6 times higher than that from chlorination in order to study the effects of different coupon materials on dbpfp more comprehensively the results of dbpfp under the chlorination were selected for discussion for the formation potential of c dbps the order of dbpfp0 was di coupon ss coupon filtered water pe coupon fig 5 a for n dbps the dbpfp0 of dcan and dcacam followed the same order di coupon pe coupon ss coupon filtered water among them the dcan and dcacam dbpfp0 of di coupon biofilm were 23 9 and 52 8 higher than those of the filtered water respectively showing that n dbp precursors in the organic components of the coupon wall biofilms were significantly denser than those of the filtered water the relative contributions of eps and cell phases in the coupon wall biofilms to dbpfp was further studied among the three kinds of coupon biofilms the c dbpfp and n dbpfp of the eps were both larger than those of the cell phases fig 5 showing that the eps contributed more to the dbpfp of the coupon wall biofilms wang et al 2013b this may be explained by the dry mass of the eps accounting for more than 90 of the biofilm while the cell phases accounted for less than 10 flemming and wingender 2010 in addition it can be inferred from fig 5b that the proportion of dcan precursors in the eps was largest and that the density of tcnm precursors in cell phases was the greatest in the di coupon biofilm the results for the pe coupon biofilms fig 5d were the same as those of the di coupon biofilms however for the ss coupon biofilms the tcnm precursors were densest in the eps while the dcan precursors were densest in the cell phases fig 5c running contrary to the features of the di coupon biofilm 3 5 organic matter compositions of coupon biofilm eps and formation pathways of dbps from the above results it is necessary to clarify changes in the organic composition of the eps of coupon wall biofilms before and after disinfection to identify the key dbp precursors involved dissolved organics are divided into hydrophobic compound hoc and hydrophilic compound cdoc and cdoc is further divided into five organics with different molecular weight distributions biopolymer bp humus hs humus degradation products bb neutral compound oa and organic acid neu the most obvious change observed before and after chlorination in the di coupon biofilm eps was for bps 13 2 doc and the proportion of bbs 300 500 g mol also decreased by 1 8 doc table s8a the same phenomenon was observed in the pe and ss coupon biofilm eps table s8b c therefore bbs and especially bps were considered to be relatively important dbp precursors in the eps of coupon wall biofilms bp is mainly composed of protein polysaccharide and polynucleotide and protein and polysaccharide levels account for more than 80 of bp in the biofilm eps hu et al 2020 due to the high saturation degree of the carbon ring structure chu et al 2012a polysaccharides have a disadvantage in terms of dbpfp compared to proteins however the basic unit of protein composition is amino acids which are the main organic nitrogen sources in eps and participate in the chlorination reaction to produce most n dbps therefore it is necessary to consider changes in the content of amino acids in eps before and after chlorination the 20 α amino acids involved in the di coupon biofilm eps before and after disinfection were all essential amino acids involved in the biosynthesis process and were of great significance to the growth of microorganisms it can be seen from table s9 that the concentrations of 20 amino acids decreased and the amino acids with greater consumption could be considered the main amino acids that made a greater contribution to the formation of dbps it is worth noting that the types of amino acids that played a key role in the formation of dbps in the three coupon biofilm eps were not the same the different microbial populations of different coupon materials also caused the types of amino acids involved to differ however further studies are needed to explain this phenomenon key amino acids his ala and trp shared by the three coupon biofilms were selected to study the types of dbps they mainly generated uhplc q exactive was used to identify dbps and the involved formation pathways were shown in fig 6 dcan dcacam and dcaa were the common dbps generated by the chlorination of the three amino acids fig s5 s6 s7 in addition some of the intermediate products of his during chlorination were transformed into tcnm and trp via chlorination and a series of decarboxylation and chlorine substitutions could form tcan previous studies yu et al 2019 ling et al 2016 had shown that dcacam was mainly derived from the hydrolysis products of dcan but at the same time decarboxylation and desamination followed the initial chlorination of ala forming a carbonyl compound that could also eventually form dcacam 3 6 toxicological evaluation of the coupon wall biofilms the analysis showed the following ordering of cytotoxicity generation potential levels of filtered water and different coupon wall biofilms di coupon ss coupon pe coupon filtered water fig 7 a the teqcyto value zhang et al 2019 safe et al 1998 of di coupon biofilm was significantly different from the teqcyto value of the other three while the teqcyto values of the filtered water and pe coupon biofilm were relatively close however the genotoxicity generation potential of the filtered water and biofilms of different coupon walls followed the following order ss coupon di coupon pe coupon filtered water fig 7b the teqgen values of the di and ss coupon biofilms were similar while the teqgen values of the filtered water and pe coupon biofilm were similar the results also demonstrated that although the dbpfp of n dbps was less than that of c dbps n dbps exhibited higher cytotoxicity and genotoxic effects that can affect the overall teqcyto and teqgen values the overall teqcyto value was mainly affected by the combined effects of dcan and haas the contribution of dcan to cytotoxic risk was the most significant reaching 62 3 70 9 followed by that of haas which accounted for 19 4 26 5 instead tcnm made the most significant genotoxicity risk contribution of up to 94 6 the main reason may be that the effective genotoxicity level of tcnm was one or two orders of magnitude higher than that of other dbps making up for the disadvantage of tcnm for dbpfp0 in summary dcan and haas were dominant in cytotoxic risk of coupon wall biofilms and tcnm was key to in the risk of genotoxicity in coupon wall biofilms at the same time the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity generation potentials of the three kinds of coupon wall biofilm eps were greater than their respective cell phases the biofilm eps contained more abundant organic components than microbial cells as precursors to generate dbps in the chlorination and disinfection reactions considering that the contact reaction between eps and disinfectants was more direct and frequent than that of cell phases in general eps was essential to influencing the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity risks of coupon wall biofilms similarly dcan made the most prominent contribution to the cytotoxicity risk of the eps and the cell phases reaching 64 3 76 1 and 50 2 61 1 respectively followed by those of haas which accounted for 15 4 23 8 and 27 0 38 6 respectively of the overall teqcyto values of the eps and cell phases fig 7c tcnm also made the most prominent contribution to genotoxicity risk in the eps and cell phases which were as high as 92 8 95 2 and 93 2 95 0 respectively followed by those of dcan fig 7d in summary the potential toxicity threat of eps of water supply coupon wall biofilms was higher than that of its cell phases under the same conditions 4 conclusions in this study the biomass thicknesses stacking degrees and cross linking levels of the three kinds of pipe wall biofilms in the stable period followed the order as ductile iron di coupon stainless steel ss coupon polyethylene pe coupon to a certain extent the di coupon biofilm had denser dbp precursors which was consistent with the di coupon biofilm having the largest dbpfp the dominant bacteria of the di and ss coupon biofilms were similar while those of the pe coupon were clearly different the dbpfp of the eps in the coupon wall biofilm was greater than that in the cell phase although the overall proportion of polysaccharides in the biofilm was greater than that of protein protein had a greater advantage in terms of dbpfp as precursors especially amino acids the key amino acids shared by the three kinds of coupon biofilm eps his ala and trp greatly contributed to the generation of dbps uhplc q exactive was used to identify the types of dbps generated by the chlorination of these three amino acids and their formation and transformation pathways compared to c dbps n dbps in biofilms had greater formation potential especially in terms of dcan and tcnm the cytotoxicity generation potential of the di coupon biofilm was the highest and the genotoxicity generation potential of the ss coupon biofilm was the highest dcan haa and tcnm play a leading role in the toxicity risk of coupon wall biofilms declaration of competing interest the

16367,there are growing concerns over the contributions of biofilms to disinfection byproduct dbp formation in engineered water systems ewss three kinds of water supply pipes ductile iron di cement lined stainless steel ss and polyethylene pe pipes were selected for the experiment conducted in this study based on test results the three pipe biofilms showed relatively obvious differences in growth morphological characteristics organic components and bacterial diversity secreted extracellular polymeric substance eps accounted for more than 90 of the biofilm and had greater disinfection byproduct formation potential dbpfp than the cell phases di pipe wall biofilms had the highest dbpfp which to a certain extent means that denser and richer organic matter can be produced as the

biofilm genotoxicity graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pipe wall biofilm extracellular polymeric substance eps microorganism amino acid disinfection byproduct formation potential dbpfp 1 introduction the safety of the drinking water supply has long been a major issue of social concern drinking water distribution systems dwdss are constructed and maintained for delivering product water to users water produced by drinking water treatment plants dwtps that meets standards can still lead to secondary pollution during the long distance transmission of dwdss waller et al 2018 the continuous increase of unremoved natural organic matter nom makes biofilm formation ubiquitous in dwdss which could result in the secondary pollution of drinking water and pose a threat to the safety of water quality and to human health mian et al 2018 li et al 2019c the pipe wall biofilms are mainly composed of microorganisms corrosion products and inorganic deposits the bacterial community encapsulated by extracellular polymeric substance eps typically accounts for more than 90 of the total biomass of water supply pipelines wang et al 2013a as an external matrix eps mainly secreted by biofilm cells account for 80 of hydrated biofilms and are mostly composed of proteins and polysaccharides that play an essential role in adhesion protection intracellular communication and nutrient retention perez et al 2017 hu et al 2020 flemming et al 2010 the characteristics of eps enable pipe wall microorganisms to adapt to adverse environments with low concentrations of nutrients and free disinfectants however the eps of pipe wall biofilms have not been extensively investigated due to limited access to dwdss disinfection is an efficacious measure broadly applied to control microbial stability in dwdss due to its cost effectiveness and practicality chlorine is the most commonly used disinfectant or oxidant for water treatment processes however an indispensable concern of disinfection is the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps which have been frequently detected in water supply pipelines and at points of use ao et al 2019 ding et al 2019 yu et al 2019 thus far more than 700 kinds of dbps have been found in drinking water and most exhibit carcinogenicity teratogenicity and mutagenicity cai et al 2018 in general emerging nitrogenous dbps n dbps e g haloacetonitriles hans and haloacetamides hacams are produced at relatively low concentrations but have more toxicological effects than currently regulated carbonaceous dbps c dbps e g trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas zhang et al 2020 despite significant knowledge of the formation of dbps in dwtps where water quality parameters and dbp yields could be monitored simultaneously the formation of dbps in dwdss is not well understood due to the complex environments and interactions occurring within pipelines more recently researchers have turned their interest to nonnegligible dbp precursors other than noms such as biofilm materials that are commonly rich in nitrogen and have a lower molecular weight than noms biofilms show better resistance than planktonic microbial cells in water so they can survive even under continuous exposure to disinfectants serving as reservoirs for dbp precursors li et al 2020a given the persistence of pipe wall biofilms and current operational responses to biofilm outbreaks during water supply which include increasing the concentration of residual disinfectants to eradicate biological risk biofilm cells and eps may be crucial contributors to dbp formation in dwdss previous studies have demonstrated that biofilm materials could react with disinfectants generating undesirable dbps in dwdss chen 2020 tommaso et al 2019 fisher et al 2017 abokifa et al 2016 it has been reported that pipe wall biofilms cultured in filtered water have greater potential for thms generation than filtered water after 48 h of reaction at a chlorine concentration of 4 mg l xu et al 2018 under the chlor am ination of mature biofilms developed in desalinated seawater eps showed higher dbp yields than biofilm cells and polysaccharides were considered more likely to be the primary dbp precursors of the eps matrix wang and hu 2018 in addition the proteins of biofilm eps can be chlorine consumers and humic substance aggregators perez and susa 2017 another previous study elucidated that under the catalysis of copper corrosion products the formation capacity of c dbps and n dbps in the eps proteins was much higher than that in polysaccharides hu et al 2020 materials used in the actual construction of water utility pipelines vary leading to significant differences in pipe wall biofilms zhang et al 2017 therefore close attention should be given to the pipe material as a key influencing factor of the dbp formation of biofilms since biofilms are heterogeneous their physical characteristics e g thickness surface roughness porosity and biomass density are intrinsic elements that will remarkably affect disinfectant transport and penetration li et al 2020a different pipe materials can result in not only different physical characteristics of biofilms bimakr et al 2018 but also discrepant compositions of biological populations zhang et al 2017 douterelo et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 further causing distinct types and contents of dbp precursors within pipe wall biofilms lehtola et al 2004 however the effect of pipe materials on the contribution of pipe wall biofilms generating dbps under the same chlorination conditions is not well known especially for n dbps and no literature has evaluated the toxicological effects of dbp formation with biofilm materials as precursors considering that ductile iron or cement lined pipe materials are widely used in practical applications this experiment selected ductile iron pipes cement lined stainless steel pipes and pe pipes as the test objects in the present study biofilm reactors containing pipe coupons were used to explore the physical and biological characteristics of biofilms formed on different pipe materials firstly then the contribution of biofilms including cells and eps to dbp yields during chlorination was investigated moreover to prevent the influence of low concentrations of certain dbps with high toxicity it was necessary to evaluate the comprehensive toxicity risk of disinfection thus an integrated understanding of differences in dbp formation from biofilms on different pipe materials and of related health threats helped develop control strategies for the harm of biofilms in dwdss providing new knowledge for assessing pipe materials the results of these experiments were obtained from biofilms grown on coupons in reactors under laboratory conditions similar experiments need to be conducted on biofilms grown on coupons inserted in actual pipes to confirm whether similar conclusions can be made regarding biofilms developed under field conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 model setup for biofilm incubation biofilm annular reactors bars model 1320lj biosurface technologies co usa were applied to simulate the dwds fig 1 showed the experimental setup of the reactor system the reactors were operated in a dwtp with taihu lake as source water and inoculated using water effluents treated by screening coagulation flocculation sedimentation gac adsorption and fast sand before disinfection table s1 the filtered water which was the effluent after the carbon filter was used as the blank control group and as the feed water for the cultivation of the biofilms in reactors each bar consisted of two concentric glass cylinders and one rotating inner drum cylinder with twenty flush mounted removable coupons each coupon offered an exposed surface area of 17 5 cm2 for biofilm growth a variable speed motor located above the reactor controls the rotation of the drum which in turn adjusted the shear stress on the outer cylinder wall according to previous studies li et al 2019a ding et al 2019 the rotational speed of inner drum cylinder was fixed at 50 rpm to provide a shear stress of 0 25 n m2 and laminar flow the hydraulic residence time was 6 h as determined by a flow rate of 2 7 ml min to eliminate light all nonopaque exposed surfaces were covered with aluminum foil the bars ran at 25 0 0 5 c for over 1 year as a sufficiently long period previously found to enable to biofilms to reach equilibrium stoodley et al 1999 gomes et al 2014 among the pipe materials applied for the mains of dwdss ductile iron di pipes and stainless steel ss pipes are commonly employed due to the convenient handling and installation there are increased concerns over polyethylene pe pipes therefore of the nine reactors in parallel there were three bars equipped with di ss and pe coupons to simulate different pipe materials prior to biofilm development the bars were disinfected as described in text s1 2 2 sample collection extraction and analysis water samples were collected from feed water and reactor effluents every two days and were tested immediately after filtration through a 0 45 μm glass fiber membrane gf f whatman uk the test methods and details of the basic water quality parameters were presented in text s2 and table s2 the bars were disassembled and di ss and pe coupons were aseptically removed before biofilm sampling each coupon was slightly washed with sterile phosphate buffer solution pbs to remove planktonic bacteria thereafter the coupons were drawn using sterile cotton swabs feazel et al 2009 the swabs were subsequently broken and placed in a sterile tube containing sterile pbs the tube was then vortexed for 2 min and the swabs were removed the suspension with biofilms was filtered with 0 20 µm filters gttp millipore usa the procedure for collecting biofilm formed on each coupon material was actualized in triplicate for eps extraction a modified cation exchange resin method with low cell lysis and high eps extraction efficiency was adopted chen 2021 wang et al 2020 wen et al 2020 liang et al 2010 the biofilm suspension and cation exchange resin 70 g g ss dowex marathon c na form 20 50 mesh sigma aldrich inc usa were transferred together into a conical flask and stirred at a speed of 500 rpm at 4 c for 6 h then the mixture was centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 20 min and the supernatant was filtered by 0 45 μm membranes two major components of the eps matrix proteins and polysaccharides were extracted and quantified separately bicinchoninic acid protein assay was used for proteins wang et al 2018 walker et al 2002 and phenol sulfuric acid method was applied for polysaccharides wang et al 2018 nielsen et al 2010 both protein and polysaccharide solutions after reaction were measured using a du800 ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer beckman coulter usa as expounded in text s3 the quantities of biofilms and eps matrix were measured as total organic carbon toc with a toc lcph analyzer shimadzu japan 2 3 biofilm morphological characterization 2 3 1 scanning electron microscopy sem the glass slides of biofilms were fixed in 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution at 4 c for 4 h after pouring out the fixation solution the biofilm samples were washed 3 times with pbs 0 1 m ph7 0 for 15 min each time 50 70 80 90 and 95 ethanol were utilized for gradient dehydration for 15 min per step and then the samples were dehydrated twice with 100 ethanol for 15 min each time prior to gold spray coating critical point drying was carried out finally the biofilm samples were observed by sem s 4800 hitachi japan 2 3 2 multiple fluorescent staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm imaging clsm with image analysis is a noninvasive means to investigate biofilm samples without destruction and can visualize the distribution of eps components in three dimensions wen et al 2020 wang et al 2018 sun et al 2011 miksch et al 2012 the biofilm samples were placed on slides and fixed with 2 5 glutaraldehyde for 12 h followed by fluorescent staining using fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc concanavalin a con a and calcofluor white cw invitrogen life science usa to stain proteins and polysaccharides chen et al 2007 2006 li et al 2015 as shown in table 1 since con a can also bind with proteins and glycoconjugate groups associated with cell walls syto 63 carlsbad usa as a cell permeative nucleic acid dye was used to differentiate eps from cells the detailed steps of staining were presented in text s4 finally the stained samples were observed through clsm lsm 800 zeiss germany table 1 also listed the corresponding excitation and emission wavelengths of each dye for a semiquantitative description of the spatial correlations among the probed substances a series of images with different z axis depths was evaluated by the zeiss lsm image browser version 4 0 0 241 and then these images were treated through the matlab program mathworks usa 2 4 dbps analytical methods all dbp standards including trichloromethane tcm monochloroacetic acid mcaa dichloroacetic acid dcaa trichloroacetic

concentrations and the residue levels of free chlorine and monochloramine were tested according to the indophenol method using a portable colorimeter dr 890 hach usa and powder pillows of freechlor f reagent and monochlor f reagent it is well recognised sathasivan et al 2020 that c dbp formation is strongly linearly related to the chlorine consumed in real water samples the tthm yield during the period of linearity with the chlorine demand chlorine consumption could be obtained by the following eq 2 2 c t t h m α t t h m c c l 0 c f o t h 0 c l c l c t t h m 0 where ccl 0 was the initial concentration of chlorine ctthm 0 was the concentration of tthm before primary chlorination cf oth 0 the x intercept could be obtained by dividing the constant by the slope to examine and compare the dbp formation from biofilm eps on different coupon materials biofilm solutions 1 5 mg c l and eps matrix harvested from corresponding biofilm solutions were performed to react with disinfectants at ph 7 0 for 24 h based on pre experiments the initial dosages of chlor am ine were 3 0 mg l which were measured to achieve the residue disinfectants in a range from 0 3 to 1 0 mg l the experiments of dbp formation were conducted with 100 ml amber bottles in the dark at 25 0 0 5 c ascorbic acid was subsequently adopted to quench the disinfectant residuals basic chemicals were purchased from nanjing chemical reagent co ltd china all solutions were prepared with ultrapure water produced from a millipore filtration system usa experimental bottles were rinsed three times with ultrapure water and then dried in an oven at 105 c for 24 h each chlor am ination experiment was actualized in triplicate 2 5 integrated toxicity evaluation mammalian chinese hamster ovary cho cells are widely used in toxicology research as experimental animal cells methods for the detection of the effective dose of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity involved in the additive model to evaluate dbp toxicity risk have been used in other studies postigo et al 2018 wagner et al 2017 the lc50 value as the dbp concentration calculated by regression analysis that induced a cell density that was 50 of the negative control corresponded to cytotoxic equivalent concentrations the cho cell genotoxicity test was based on the comparison of genotoxicity endpoints using single cell gel electrophoresis scge the scge 50 tail dna value was used as the primary metric to compare the genotoxic potency for each dbp the relevant model and values were presented in text s6 and table s3 2 6 statistics analysis the tests were conducted in triplicate results were expressed as mean standard analysis of variance anova was used to compare the results and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant the data were analyzed by spss version 20 0 ibm usa and origin 9 0 origin lab usa relative standard deviation was typified by error bars 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphological characteristics of biofilms overtime fig s1 the growth of biofilms on different coupons basically showed a logarithmic growth trend in the initial stage and then the growth rate gradually slowed and finally stabilized sem was used to observe the three dimensional morphological characteristics of the biofilm surfaces and the degree of crosslinking the sem observation results were shown in fig 2 at corresponding magnifications of 500 3000 and 10 000 times fig 2 showed that the biofilm density and thickness of different coupon wall biofilms were ordered as follows di coupon biofilm ss coupon biofilm pe coupon biofilm which were consistent with the trend of biofilm biomass this result clearly indicateed that the di coupon biofilm had a more complex and developed structure than the other two coupon wall biofilms fig 2a b at the same time the rich zoogloea and eps better promoted cross linking between the biofilms showing that the di coupon biofilm contained more organic components that can be used as the precursors of dbps as shown in fig 2c the biofilms on the walls of different coupons had some morphological structures similar to those of holes and trenches collectively referred to as pore channels these structures promoted the growth and development of coupon wall biofilms according to observations the pore channels of the di and ss coupon biofilms were more compact than those of the pe coupon biofilms to a certain extent the densest pore channels and eps wrap protection of di coupon biofilms can prevent the disinfectant in water from easily penetrating and killing biofilm cells directly also making it difficult to clearly observe a single cell body however individual cells were relatively easy to identify on the pe coupon biofilms and many directly exposed cells were found in general bacilli and cocci were the types of microorganisms most widely found in the three pipe wall biofilms wang et al 2015 and morphological differences between microorganisms were not significant 3 2 multiple fluorescent staining and clsm imaging fig 3 showed the fluorescent staining results of viable and dead bacteria identified from different coupon wall biofilms through observation it was found that the mature coupon wall biofilms of the three kinds of coupon materials had a certain thickness and the stacking and density of microbial cells were ordered as follows di coupon biofilm ss coupon biofilm pe coupon biofilm consistent with the above growth regularities and the results of sem observation mature coupon wall biofilm cells were dominated by viable bacteria and some dead bacteria also appeared table s4 di coupon biofilms had the most viable bacteria with green fluorescent intensity levels 24 9 and 57 0 higher than those of ss coupon and pe coupon biofilms respectively viable bacteria can play a microbial mediated role in degrading organic matter in water and generating new metabolites including dbp precursors providing more precursors for the formation of dbps conversely dead bacteria do not have this active function therefore to a certain extent the more viable bacteria there are in coupon wall biofilms under the same culture conditions the more potential for dbp generation there is the relative spatial distribution of protein and polysaccharide content was described by fluorescent intensity per unit of volume table s5 protein and α polysaccharide levels were ordered as follows di coupon biofilm ss coupon biofilm pe coupon biofilm table s6 and the β polysaccharide content was ordered as follows pe coupon biofilm di coupon biofilm ss coupon biofilm in addition the proportions of polysaccharides were greater than those of protein fig s2 in the three pipe biofilms wang et al 2018 3 3 community diversity the illumina miseq pe300 gene sequencing platform was used to carry out high throughput sequencing li et al 2020b for the wall biofilms of the di ss and pe coupons and the selected high quality 16s rrna sequences were clustered with 97 gene similarity to obtain the otu analysis of each sample rehman et al 2020 oh et al 2018 li et al 2019b a total of 1654 1421 and 1150 otus were found in the biofilms from the di pe and ss coupons respectively to compare the alpha diversity levels of the coupon biofilm microorganisms the diversity index shannon simpson and richness index ace chao1 were calculated table s7 a comparison of the shannon and simpson indices showed that species diversity levels ranked in the following order di coupon biofilm ss coupon biofilm pe coupon biofilm table s7 a comparison of the ace and chao1 indices also showed that the species richness of pe coupons was the lowest while that of di coupons was slightly higher than that of ss coupons table s7 the species diversity and richness of the three different coupon biofilms were largely consistent with the biomass trend which may be attributed to the roughness of the inner wall of the di coupons and the protection of the corrosion scale layer which created an conducive growth and reproduction environment for the internal microorganisms according to the results of the otu analysis and classification by the rdp classifier 107 classes and 585 genera were detected in the di coupons 93 classes and 573 genera were detected in the ss coupons and 89 classes and 554 genera were detected in the pe coupons respectively fig 4 a in addition 77 and 451 bacterial classes and genera were respectively common among the three kinds of coupon biofilms fig 4b in the di and ss coupon biofilms alphaproteobacteria 24 77 and gammaproteobacteria 21 17 were the main bacteria revetta et al 2013 lautenschlager et al 2013 indicating that these two proteobacteria exhibited strong adaptability and broad ubiquity the dominant bacteria in the di and ss coupon biofilms were similar but the relative abundance distributions of species differed in contrast the relative abundances of thermoleophilia 19 05 and saccharimonadia 18 12 in pe coupon biofilm microorganisms were more prominent fig 4c at the genus level the community structures of biofilm microorganisms in the three kinds of coupon walls also varied the results given in the heatmap chart showed that the dominant bacterial genera and relative abundance distributions of the three coupons were completely different fig s3 the results showed that norank f norank o saccharimonadales norank f 67 14 hyphomicrobium methylibium and candidatus tenderia had significant differences p 0 05 corresponding to the dominant bacterial genera of different coupon biofilms shown in fig s4 these significant differences indicate that these five types of bacteria can describe to a certain extent the species differences of microorganisms on coupon wall biofilms hemdan et al 2019 of di ss and pe coupons fig s3 3 4 dbp formation potential as the organic matter composition and dbp precursor content on the three kinds of coupon wall biofilms of di ss and pe coupons with the same coupon area varied the dbpfp of each coupon wall biofilm was divided by its corresponding doc value of organic matter to determine the content of dbp precursor in the unit mass of organic matter which was called the unit dbp formation potential of the coupon wall biofilms dbpfp0 the higher the density of dbp precursors in the biofilm of a certain water supply coupon is the greater the potential threat to the effluent water becomes it is worth explaining that dbps were significantly different due to the disinfectant types trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas dichloroacetamide dcacam dichloroacetonitrile dcan and trichloronitromethane tcnm were observed during the chlorination however only trihalomethanes thms and tcnm were detected during the chloramination the c dbps concentration from chlorination was 6 4 times higher than that from chloramination while the n dbps concentration from chloramination was 2 6 times higher than that from chlorination in order to study the effects of different coupon materials on dbpfp more comprehensively the results of dbpfp under the chlorination were selected for discussion for the formation potential of c dbps the order of dbpfp0 was di coupon ss coupon filtered water pe coupon fig 5 a for n dbps the dbpfp0 of dcan and dcacam followed the same order di coupon pe coupon ss coupon filtered water among them the dcan and dcacam dbpfp0 of di coupon biofilm were 23 9 and 52 8 higher than those of the filtered water respectively showing that n dbp precursors in the organic components of the coupon wall biofilms were significantly denser than those of the filtered water the relative contributions of eps and cell phases in the coupon wall biofilms to dbpfp was further studied among the three kinds of coupon biofilms the c dbpfp and n dbpfp of the eps were both larger than those of the cell phases fig 5 showing that the eps contributed more to the dbpfp of the coupon wall biofilms wang et al 2013b this may be explained by the dry mass of the eps accounting for more than 90 of the biofilm while the cell phases accounted for less than 10 flemming and wingender 2010 in addition it can be inferred from fig 5b that the proportion of dcan precursors in the eps was largest and that the density of tcnm precursors in cell phases was the greatest in the di coupon biofilm the results for the pe coupon biofilms fig 5d were the same as those of the di coupon biofilms however for the ss coupon biofilms the tcnm precursors were densest in the eps while the dcan precursors were densest in the cell phases fig 5c running contrary to the features of the di coupon biofilm 3 5 organic matter compositions of coupon biofilm eps and formation pathways of dbps from the above results it is necessary to clarify changes in the organic composition of the eps of coupon wall biofilms before and after disinfection to identify the key dbp precursors involved dissolved organics are divided into hydrophobic compound hoc and hydrophilic compound cdoc and cdoc is further divided into five organics with different molecular weight distributions biopolymer bp humus hs humus degradation products bb neutral compound oa and organic acid neu the most obvious change observed before and after chlorination in the di coupon biofilm eps was for bps 13 2 doc and the proportion of bbs 300 500 g mol also decreased by 1 8 doc table s8a the same phenomenon was observed in the pe and ss coupon biofilm eps table s8b c therefore bbs and especially bps were considered to be relatively important dbp precursors in the eps of coupon wall biofilms bp is mainly composed of protein polysaccharide and polynucleotide and protein and polysaccharide levels account for more than 80 of bp in the biofilm eps hu et al 2020 due to the high saturation degree of the carbon ring structure chu et al 2012a polysaccharides have a disadvantage in terms of dbpfp compared to proteins however the basic unit of protein composition is amino acids which are the main organic nitrogen sources in eps and participate in the chlorination reaction to produce most n dbps therefore it is necessary to consider changes in the content of amino acids in eps before and after chlorination the 20 α amino acids involved in the di coupon biofilm eps before and after disinfection were all essential amino acids involved in the biosynthesis process and were of great significance to the growth of microorganisms it can be seen from table s9 that the concentrations of 20 amino acids decreased and the amino acids with greater consumption could be considered the main amino acids that made a greater contribution to the formation of dbps it is worth noting that the types of amino acids that played a key role in the formation of dbps in the three coupon biofilm eps were not the same the different microbial populations of different coupon materials also caused the types of amino acids involved to differ however further studies are needed to explain this phenomenon key amino acids his ala and trp shared by the three coupon biofilms were selected to study the types of dbps they mainly generated uhplc q exactive was used to identify dbps and the involved formation pathways were shown in fig 6 dcan dcacam and dcaa were the common dbps generated by the chlorination of the three amino acids fig s5 s6 s7 in addition some of the intermediate products of his during chlorination were transformed into tcnm and trp via chlorination and a series of decarboxylation and chlorine substitutions could form tcan previous studies yu et al 2019 ling et al 2016 had shown that dcacam was mainly derived from the hydrolysis products of dcan but at the same time decarboxylation and desamination followed the initial chlorination of ala forming a carbonyl compound that could also eventually form dcacam 3 6 toxicological evaluation of the coupon wall biofilms the analysis showed the following ordering of cytotoxicity generation potential levels of filtered water and different coupon wall biofilms di coupon ss coupon pe coupon filtered water fig 7 a the teqcyto value zhang et al 2019 safe et al 1998 of di coupon biofilm was significantly different from the teqcyto value of the other three while the teqcyto values of the filtered water and pe coupon biofilm were relatively close however the genotoxicity generation potential of the filtered water and biofilms of different coupon walls followed the following order ss coupon di coupon pe coupon filtered water fig 7b the teqgen values of the di and ss coupon biofilms were similar while the teqgen values of the filtered water and pe coupon biofilm were similar the results also demonstrated that although the dbpfp of n dbps was less than that of c dbps n dbps exhibited higher cytotoxicity and genotoxic effects that can affect the overall teqcyto and teqgen values the overall teqcyto value was mainly affected by the combined effects of dcan and haas the contribution of dcan to cytotoxic risk was the most significant reaching 62 3 70 9 followed by that of haas which accounted for 19 4 26 5 instead tcnm made the most significant genotoxicity risk contribution of up to 94 6 the main reason may be that the effective genotoxicity level of tcnm was one or two orders of magnitude higher than that of other dbps making up for the disadvantage of tcnm for dbpfp0 in summary dcan and haas were dominant in cytotoxic risk of coupon wall biofilms and tcnm was key to in the risk of genotoxicity in coupon wall biofilms at the same time the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity generation potentials of the three kinds of coupon wall biofilm eps were greater than their respective cell phases the biofilm eps contained more abundant organic components than microbial cells as precursors to generate dbps in the chlorination and disinfection reactions considering that the contact reaction between eps and disinfectants was more direct and frequent than that of cell phases in general eps was essential to influencing the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity risks of coupon wall biofilms similarly dcan made the most prominent contribution to the cytotoxicity risk of the eps and the cell phases reaching 64 3 76 1 and 50 2 61 1 respectively followed by those of haas which accounted for 15 4 23 8 and 27 0 38 6 respectively of the overall teqcyto values of the eps and cell phases fig 7c tcnm also made the most prominent contribution to genotoxicity risk in the eps and cell phases which were as high as 92 8 95 2 and 93 2 95 0 respectively followed by those of dcan fig 7d in summary the potential toxicity threat of eps of water supply coupon wall biofilms was higher than that of its cell phases under the same conditions 4 conclusions in this study the biomass thicknesses stacking degrees and cross linking levels of the three kinds of pipe wall biofilms in the stable period followed the order as ductile iron di coupon stainless steel ss coupon polyethylene pe coupon to a certain extent the di coupon biofilm had denser dbp precursors which was consistent with the di coupon biofilm having the largest dbpfp the dominant bacteria of the di and ss coupon biofilms were similar while those of the pe coupon were clearly different the dbpfp of the eps in the coupon wall biofilm was greater than that in the cell phase although the overall proportion of polysaccharides in the biofilm was greater than that of protein protein had a greater advantage in terms of dbpfp as precursors especially amino acids the key amino acids shared by the three kinds of coupon biofilm eps his ala and trp greatly contributed to the generation of dbps uhplc q exactive was used to identify the types of dbps generated by the chlorination of these three amino acids and their formation and transformation pathways compared to c dbps n dbps in biofilms had greater formation potential especially in terms of dcan and tcnm the cytotoxicity generation potential of the di coupon biofilm was the highest and the genotoxicity generation potential of the ss coupon biofilm was the highest dcan haa and tcnm play a leading role in the toxicity risk of coupon wall biofilms declaration of competing interest the

16368,stormwater control measures scm can remove and accumulate microplastics and may serve as a long term source of microplastics for groundwater pollution because of their potential for downward mobility in subsurface furthermore the number of microplastics accumulated in scm may have been underestimated as the calculation typically only accounts for microplastics accumulated via episodic stormwater loading and ignores microplastic accumuation via continuous atmospheric deposition to evaluate the source pathways of accumulated microplastics and their potential for downward mobility to groundwater we analyzed spatial distributions of microplastics above ground on the canopy around scm and below ground in the subsurface in and outside the boundaries of fourteen scm in los angeles using an exponential model we link subsurface retardation of microplastics to the median particle size of soil d50 and land use despite receiving significantly more stormwater microplastic concentrations in scm at surface depth or subsurface depth were not significantly different from the concentration at the same depth outside the scm similar concentration in and outside of scm indicates that stormwater is not the sole source of microplastics accumulated in scm the high concentration of microplastics on leaves of vegetation in scm confirms that the contribution of atmospheric deposition is significant within and outside the scm boundary microplastics are removed within the top 5 cm of the subsurface and their concentration decreases exponentially with depth indicating limited potential for groundwater pollution from the microplastics accumulated in scm outside the scm boundary the subsurface retardation coefficient decreases with increases in d50 indicating straining of microplastics as the dominant removal mechanism inside the boundary of scm however the retardation coefficient was independent of d50 implying that microplastics could have either moved deeper into the filter layer in scm or that compost mulch or organic amendments used in the filter media were pre contaminated with microplastics overall these results provide insights on microplastics source accumulation and downward mobility in scm keywords subsurface urban runoff green infrastructure straining biofilters dry deposition canopy trapping 1 introduction microplastics from urban compartments including trash or litter roads knight et al 2020 kole et al 2017 biosolid applied land crossman et al 2020 koutnik et al 2021a landfills he et al 2019 su et al 2019 and soils rafique et al 2020 su et al 2020 are washed off by stormwater moruzzi et al 2020 müller et al 2020 piñon colin et al 2020 and enter surface waters leslie et al 2017 treilles et al 2021 thus stormwater control measures scm which are typically used to reduce runoff and remove stormwater pollutants including sediments can capture these microplastics liu et al 2019 smyth et al 2021 and minimize pollution downstream however accumulated microplastics in scm can also disintegrate over time andrady 2011 zhang et al 2021 and the smaller microplastics could migrate downward through the subsurface to groundwater if their transport is not retarded by the filter media in scm the risk of groundwater pollution also depends on the total amount of microplastics accumulated in scm and the fraction of which are available for downward mobilization thus it is critical to account for all the pathways that contribute to microplastic inventory in scm and examine their downward mobility potential towards groundwater stormwater runoff is typically assumed to be the main source of microplastics in the scm liu et al 2019 werbowski et al 2021 even though atmospheric deposition can be a significant source brahney et al 2020 dris et al 2016 unlike stormwater loading which is episodic and happens a few times a year in response to precipitation events atmospheric deposition is continuous throughout the year thus net loading via atmospheric deposition could add up to a significant amount other studies have examined atmospheric transport of microplastics mbachu et al 2020 roblin et al 2020 wang et al 2021 and some of which could deposit in the scm smyth et al 2021 several studies have examined microplastic concentration in soil or filter media in scm boni et al 2021 gilbreath et al 2019 lange et al 2021 smyth et al 2021 but they did not examine the concentration of microplastics accumulated on the vegetation vegetation canopy can intercept microplastics liu et al 2020 sun et al 2021 and contribute to the net inventory of microplastics in scm high concentrations of microplastics are frequently found in the dust abbasi et al 2019 koutnik et al 2021b zhang et al 2020 which can be transported by wind bullard et al 2021 rezaei et al 2019 and redistributed in urban areas as microplastics concentration in the canopy in scm can serve as an indicator of microplastics deposition from the atmosphere it is critical to estimate microplastic concentration trapped by vegetation on scm the extent to which the accumulated microplastics can move downward in scm in field conditions has not been evaluated despite earlier evidence of subsurface mobility of microplastics during intermittent infiltration of rainwater mohanty et al 2015a microplastic removal and transport processes in scm can be inferred from the knowledge of particulate transport or removal mechanisms in the scm tirpak et al 2021 microplastics similar to particles or sediments can be removed by settling adsorption and filtration from stormwater gavrić et al 2019 massoudieh et al 2017 although most microplastics owing to their large size are expected to be filtered out in topsoil luo et al 2020 smaller microplastics could potentially migrate downward with infiltrating stormwater previous studies have shown that microspheres of size greater than 2 µm are retarded rapidly with limited transport potential gao et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 furthermore pm10 or particulate matter with a size less than 10 µm is relevant for air transport as any larger particles are less likely to be relevant for long range transport and disposition on scm by the wind the hydraulic conductivity and porosity of the filter layer in scm are typically high to facilitate a faster infiltration tirpak et al 2021 which can also enhance the downward migration of microplastics furthermore scms are exposed to intermittent infiltration of stormwater or dry wet cycles which could accelerate the downward migration of microplastics in the subsurface mohanty et al 2015b o connor et al 2019 however a lack of depth distribution data from scm where microplastics have been accumulated for years precludes our understanding of the vertical migration of microplastics in scm the study aims to evaluate the contribution of atmospheric deposition on the net accumulation of microplastics in scm and examine the downward mobility potential of the accumulated microplastics to achieve the objectives we measured the below and above ground distribution of microplastics in locations within and outside scm boundary and fit below ground distribution data to an exponential retardation model with the median particle size of soil d50 to evaluate the importance of straining on the removal of microplastics from infiltrating stormwater the result informs the potential of scm to serve as a long term source or sink of microplastics 2 methods 2 1 soil sample collection from scm to compare the concentration of microplastics within and outside the physical boundary of scm we collected soils from fourteen scm in los angeles on may 20th and 21st 2021 fig 1 which was more than 2 months after the last recorded rainfall in the area scm are categorized for their type and the surrounding environment or land use table s1 the five location types were driveways and parking lots residential areas with single family homes and low traffic neighborhood streets commercial areas with medium traffic streets near business establishments high traffic areas beside freeways and a natural area beside a river drainage pipe near clusters of trees and bushes locations outside the scm boundary did not have stormwater inlets and were hydraulically disconnected from the scm with a distance of 2 to 15 m away from the scm boundary thus most microplastics found outside the scm boundary were assumed to be from atmospheric deposition by comparing microplastics concentrations within and outside the scm boundary we evaluated the importance of atmospheric deposition the below ground concentration of microplastics was estimated by collecting soil samples from the surface and subsurface to collect soil samples a stainless steel hand auger with a diameter of 2 5 cm was inserted into the subsurface to a depth of 10 cm at three random spots inside and outside the boundary of scm from the auger soils were extracted by a stainless steel spatula into aluminum foil from two depths 0 2 cm surface and 8 10 cm subsurface wherever the soil was impenetrable beyond the top layer due to rocks or hard packed soil only surface samples were collected the core was thoroughly cleaned between sampling to prevent cross contamination to determine the spatial distribution of microplastics at high resolution both under and above ground one roadside bioswale was sampled extensively this location was extensively sampled to compare the below ground concentration profile in soil and above ground on vegetation canopy leaves were collected at different elevations from 0 15 m to 2 5 m from two plant species at one location and wrapped individually in aluminum foil to prevent cross contamination to determine the spatial distribution of microplastics on the surface of the soil layer samples were collected at 1 2 3 and 4 meters from the inlet in addition four 22 5 cm cores were collected near the inlet of the scm and soil samples were extracted from different depths at 2 5 cm increments to examine how the particle size of subsurface soil can affect the downward migration of microplastics we measured the particle size distribution of subsurface samples 8 10 cm a portion of soil from subsurface samples at a site was mixed to create a composite sample which was first sieved using a 2 mm sieve to remove any gravel the sieved sample was mixed with water to create a slurry and the size distribution of soil particles suspended in a liquid aqueous liquid module alm was measured using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer ls 13320 beckman coulter inc ca usa 2 2 extraction and quantification of microplastics in soil samples microplastics were isolated from soil samples by density separation cutroneo et al 2021 briefly 1 0 gram of soil sample was mixed in 40 ml of 1 6 g ml 1 ki solution in a 50 ml centrifuge tube and the mixture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 min to settle heavier soil particles from lighter density 1 6 g cm 3 particles that include microplastics and organic debris mu et al 2019 the supernatant was vacuum filtrated to trap floating debris on a filter paper 50 mm whatman cellulose filter 0 45 µm pore size and the residue from the filter paper was diluted by washing off the debris from the first filter paper into a glass beaker using 100 ml of di water 10 ml of the samples were pipetted using glass pipettes onto a vacuum filtration setup fitted with a 24 mm glass fiber filter paper with 1 2 μm pore size thermo fisher scientific a method blank was obtained where di water was processed through all the steps to estimate any microplastics introduced from the materials used during the extraction steps the concentration of microplastics on the filter paper was quantified by coloring microplastics with nile red and counting the colored particles by image processing as demonstrated in many studies erni cassola et al 2017 shim et al 2016 tamminga et al 2017 in this study we stained the filters containing floating debris with 0 17 ml of 0 5 µg ml 1 nile red in chloroform solution maes et al 2017 in a glass petri dish and air dried with a glass cover for 24 h in the fume hood dried filter membranes were transferred onto glass slides covered with a glass coverslip to eliminate dust deposition and imaged using a smartphone based fluorescence microscope the detailed method for sample preparation and counting is described in the supplementary material it should be noted that optical detection relies on the sensitivity and selectivity of nile red to bind microplastics thus the method is susceptible to all limitations discovered in other studies that have used nile red some microplastics such as tire particles may not have been detected if they do not absorb nile red however our preliminary study confirmed that our method was able to detect the most common microplastics in the mixture containing compost or mulch which are the primary source of organics in the biofilter we did not analyze the size or shape distribution of microplastics detected the method can detect microplastics as small as 10 µm due to a large field of view of 490 mm2 the largest size of microplastic observed in our study is 2 25 mm 2 3 the concentration of microplastics on leaves to quantify the number of microplastics per unit surface area of leaves collected leaves were cut using metal scissors into a rectangular shape so that surface area could be measured the debris from the leaves was washed with 100 ml of di water into a glass beaker and each leaf was sonicated inside the respective beaker in 100 ml of water for 30 min after sonication the microplastics suspension was vacuum filtrated onto a 24 mm g4 glass fiber membrane the membranes were then dyed with nile red and dried as described above blank or pre washed leaves were also dyed to ensure there are no fluorescent particles on the leaves without microplastics 2 4 quality assurance and quality control for sampling storage and processing pre washed non plastic containers were used all clean glassware and containers were rinsed with di water three times the di water was analyzed for possible microplastic contamination triplicate samples from 14 sites were collected to get a wide distribution of data each sample was mixed thoroughly and a representative 1 gram of each of those samples was analyzed for microplastics concentration a total of 140 environmental soil samples were analyzed including replicates no field blanks were collected as the samples were taken from the subsurface using clean tools we have performed laboratory blanks to account for any cross contamination in addition during every day of analysis a method blank was run following the same lab procedure as sample analysis the mean laboratory blank for sediment samples was 5 pieces and the mean for leaf samples was 6 pieces table s2 the mean of laboratory blanks for each method was subtracted from the measured concentration of samples to account for any microplastics introduced from any material used we performed a recovery test using our method where water samples containing a known number of microplastics were processed table s3 the test resulted in an average recovery rate of 93 7 13 7 table s4 to check how different processing steps influence the quantification result two variability tests were performed human processing variation was found to be 6 8 of the mean and the sample processing variation was 9 1 table s4 therefore the total maximum error for each of the microplastic measurements was estimated to be 22 2 2 5 subsurface microplastics retention profile microplastics removal can be modeled similarly to the removal of colloids or sediments large articles 5 µm are typically removed by settling or straining and removal of particles larger than 10 µm is dominated by straining as they are blocked by narrow pores the typical pore size in biofilter is around 30 µm and the minimum size microplastics that can be detected were of 10 µm size thus we assumed straining to be the dominant mechanism and used an empirical equation with an exponential function similar to gao et al 2021 c z c 0 e k z where c and c 0 are microplastic concentrations p g 1 at depth z cm and on the surface respectively and k is the retardation coefficient thus k is estimated by the fitting depth and concentration data into the model the retardation coefficient is different from the commonly used retardation factor which is estimated by comparing the velocity of water with the velocity of contaminant based on the breakthrough curves in our case breakthrough curves were not obtained due to the complete filtration of microplastics in the biofilter thus estimated k includes absorption straining gravity settling and removal by any other mechanism microplastics are expected to be removed by physical filtration or straining where the removal or straining rate can increase with increasing colloid size and decreasing median grain size d50 bradford et al 2003 the exponential model was verified at one site and the same was assumed for other sites the assumption is based on the result of a previous study that found that microplastic penetration depth is sensitive to the ratio of the size of microplastics and grain diameter in biofilter and that 10 µm or larger microplastics would have shallow penetration depth in porous media relevant for stormwater biofilter waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2020 as the size detection limit of microplastics in our study is 10 µm our observation is limited to larger 10 µm microplastics thus caution should be maintained when extrapolating our results to smaller microplastics 1 µm which can be more mobile 2 6 statistical analysis to calculate the statistical difference in concentration of microplastics in and outside the scm a wilcoxon rank sum test was performed r version 4 0 0 with notation signifying p value 0 05 meaning p value 0 01 and ns showing the data is not statistically significant we use a linear model lm function in r to estimate the standard error the 95 confidence interval was estimated by using t statistics 3 results 3 1 microplastic concentrations inside and outside of scm are similar the spatial distribution of microplastics within and outside of scm reveals that the concentration of microplastics within the scm boundary is similar p 0 05 to the concentration outside the boundary fig 2 microplastic concentrations in samples varied between 0 and 2784 particles per gram of soil p g 1 based on location and depth of soil in particular the concentration decreased with subsurface depth in all locations concentration in surface samples was significantly higher than the concentration in subsurface samples irrespective of the locations within or outside scm boundary the mean microplastic concentration outside scm was 283 p g 1 for the top surface and 82 p g 1 for subsurface samples inside scm the mean concentration was 472 p g 1 for the top surface and 149 p g 1 for subsurface samples 3 2 subsurface microplastic concentration decreases exponentially with depth analysis of microplastic concentration at five depths at one scm reveals that microplastic concentration decreases exponentially with depth fig 3 based on the exponential fit with the mean concentration of microplastics at different depths we estimated the mean retardation coefficient k at this location to be 0 13 k value from the whole data set is 0 18 with a standard error of 0 64 and a 95 confidence interval from 0 11 to 0 50 3 3 plant leaves around scm contained a high concentration of microplastics leaves collected at different heights from the ground contained high concentrations of microplastics ranging from 0 to 66 p cm 2 fig 4 the concentration on leaves initially increased with height reaching maximum values around 1 5 m above the ground above this height an increase in height decreased the concentration of microplastics 3 4 retardation coefficients are similar between location types assuming an exponential decrease in the concentration of microplastics with depth in all other locations we calculated retardation coefficients k for all locations and the retardation coefficients were independent of location type or land use fig 5 a to check if the median particle size d50 affects the retardation coefficient as it does for straining coefficient bradford et al 2003 we compared the correlation of retardation coefficient with d50 inside and outside scm with an increase in soil particle size d50 retardation coefficient decreases outside the scm indicating filtration or straining is the dominant retention mechanism outside scm in contrast inside scm no such correlation was observed fig 5b 4 discussion 4 1 microplastics are retained within the top 5 cm of subsurface vertical profiles of microplastic concentrations in scm reveal that scm is effective in filtering most microplastics from stormwater and the majority are retained within the top 5 cm layer fig 2 the trend is consistent in locations outside the scm indicating subsurface soil is an effective barrier to filter microplastics from runoff and could prevent groundwater pollution with microplastics the result is expected based on the previous understanding of particle mobility in the subsurface soil particles greater than 10 µm are expected to be filtered out in soil by settling and straining or physical filtration bradford et al 2003 chu et al 2019 tong et al 2020 waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2020 however microplastics accumulated on the surface can become disintegrated by uv radiation song et al 2017 weinstein et al 2016 or biodegradation gonzález pleiter et al 2019 kalogerakis et al 2017 releasing much smaller microplastics that may have higher mobility pelley and tufenkji 2008 sirivithayapakorn and keller 2003 than the ones detected in most studies furthermore microplastics are of different shapes such as rod fragment and sphere which can influence their transport ma et al 2020 waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2020 future studies should examine the influence of microplastic shapes on their mobility in stormwater treatment systems we estimated the retardation coefficient in all locations assuming an exponential decrease in the concentration of microplastics with depth we also observed that the mean retardation coefficient in scm is slightly lower than the mean retardation coefficient outside of scm fig s3a indicating some microplastics are more likely to transport deeper into the subsurface in scm than outside scm we attributed this to the pore size distribution of subsurface media and the infiltration rate of stormwater infiltration based scm typically uses sand or sandy soil which has a higher porosity and hydraulic conductivity than the native soil tirpak et al 2021 however d50 outside scm applears slightly higher than that inside scm although not statistically significant fig s3b thus it is expected that the microplastics may move deeper into the subsurface in scm than they would outside scm furthermore microplastic transport in subsurface soil can be enhanced by intermittent infiltration of stormwater mohanty et al 2015b which typically occurs in scm subsurface soil or filter layer in scm is naturally subjected to dry wet cycles and freeze thaw cycles mohanty et al 2014 2015b which can release colloids and accmulated pollutants borthakur et al 2021a b recent studies show that dry wet cycles accelerate the downward migration of microplastics gao et al 2021 o connor et al 2019 although most microplastics are found within a depth of up to 7 5 cm even after extensive weathering and dry wet cycles o connor et al 2019 rillig et al 2017 in our study the scm are 5 years or older and have been subjected to various weathering cycles and have accumulated microplastics for many years thus we assume that the concentration profile is at a semi steady state overall our results show that the top 5 cm of soil in scm removes microplastics from stormwater and potentially prevents groundwater pollution however this finding could have other unexplored consequences for instance accumulated microplastics can adsorb pollutants from stormwater aghilinasrollahabadi et al 2020 and become suspended by wind thereby posing an inhalation risk borthakur et al 2021 in addition a high concentration of microplastics in the top 5 cm of subsurface where roots are concentrated could affect biochemical processes in the root zone de souza machado et al 2018 van weert et al 2019 thus future studies should quantify the impact of accumulated microplastics on the functions of scm 4 2 straining is the dominant removal mechanism for microplastics outside scm filter medium composition particularly particle size distribution varies widely in the scm tirpak et al 2021 which can affect the removal of microplastics or their downward mobility in this study we compared how the retardation coefficient changes with median particle size d50 both inside and outside scm an increase in retardation coefficient with a decrease in d50 of soil outside scm indicates that straining is a dominant removal mechanism for microplastics in subsurface soil fig 5a straining is particularly expected for large particles where the passage of particles through narrow pores is blocked auset and keller 2006 bradford et al 2006 there is no exception for microplastics the size detection limit of this study is 10 µm scm are typically composed of sandy soil with a mean pore radius of 32 µm ding et al 2019 indicating microplastics in the same size range can be filtered out by physical straining unlike soil coarse sand could permit the passage of large microplastics due to large pore size analyzing sediment size distribution in influent and effluent of model biofilter packed with the sand column a previous study found that nearly 99 of the sediments with size 10 µm were filtered out by straining valenca et al 2020 for the same reason the penetration depth of 10 µm size microplastics was observed to be below 10 cm waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2020 typical depth of filter layer in scm is over 30 cm thus we assumed that the probability of microplastics passing through the entire filter layer is very small the retardation coefficient did not decrease with an increase in median particle size of filter media in scm fig 5b the results suggest that the concentrations of microplastics in deeper layers of scm are higher than that predicted by the exponential retardation model there could be several reasons for this discrepancy first filter layer in scm typically consists of a mixture of sand and mulch compost or other organic amendments tirpak et al 2021 which may contain microplastics watteau et al 2018 weithmann et al 2018 thus the microplastics found in deeper layers may have been introduced by the amendments used during the installation of the scm second bioturbation could play a significant role in moving nanoplastics in scm via injection heinze et al 2021 and microplastics via the preferential flow paths created by earthworms yu et al 2019 the extent of these processes in different scm could vary third the infiltration rate in the scm is high to prevent overland flow which could facilitate the relocation of microplastics from the surface layer into deeper layers if pore sizes are bigger than microplastic size previous studies demonstrated enhanced transport of colloids or particles with an increase in flow rate through porous media kretzschmar et al 1999 a similar process could also enhance the transport of microplastics in scm most scm are designed by replacing soil with sand to increase hydraulic conductivity tirpak et al 2021 which could increase relative pore size and enhance the transport of small microplastics in our study we could not distinguish whether enhanced transport in filter media or pre contamination from filter media is the cause of a relatively high concentration of microplastics in deeper subsurface layers thus future studies should screen the typical amendments for microplastic contamination before their use in the scm and examine the subsurface distribution profile of microplastics after many years of stormwater infiltration 4 3 the atmosphere is a significant source of microplastics accumulated in scm understanding the source and the processes by which microplastics may accumulate in scm can help assess whether scm can become a long term source of microplastics for groundwater pollution and be an effective strategy to prevent redistribution of microplastics in the environment while it is typically assumed that stormwater is a dominant source of microplastics found in scm our study shows that contribution of atmospheric deposition is just as important although the mean microplastic concentration appears to be higher inside scm than outside of scm the difference is not statistically significant fig 2 thus despite receiving more stormwater runoff scm did not accumulate more microplastics than the location outside scm this result indicates that stormwater is not the only source of microplastics accumulated in the scm and atmospheric deposition both wet and dry is also a significant source of microplastics in urban areas this result confirmed the finding of another study where field blanks were found to have a high concentration of microplastics smyth et al 2021 atmospheric dry deposition is particularly significant in dry climates abbasi and turner 2021 the los angeles area where the sampled scm are located does not receive regular or frequent rainfall which could result in scm receiving lower amounts of stormwater than the scm located in wet climates sadeghi et al 2019 thus most microplastics deposited on land could be via dry deposition or wind which occurs throughout the year transport of waterborne microplastics is event based and is associated with intense rainfall while deposition of airborne microplastics is continuous throughout the year thus we surmise that continuous deposition of microplastics in dry seasons throughout the year may have overshadowed any high amount of microplastics deposited in sporadic runoff events one may argue that flooding after high intensity rainfalls could redistribute microplastics beyond the scm by overflow daly et al 2012 sanders and grant 2020 in many of the sampling sites in our study however the locations outside the boundary are at a higher elevation above the curb where floodwater would rarely reach our result indicates that atmospheric deposition or wind blown microplastics could be a significant source of microplastics accumulated in scm the presence of microplastics on leaves of vegetation around scm further confirmed this hypothesis dust can be deposited on leaves via dry deposition falling off from the sky interception of wind horizontal transport or rain splash from the ground surface gonzales et al 2018 the same processes are also relevant for the transport and deposition of airborne microplastics if dry deposition is the dominant process the concentration of microplastics should be higher on leaves at high elevations in contrast we found that the concentration on leaves was lower at the 2 5 m height and was the highest at 1 5 m height fig 4 the size of microplastics similar to any other airborne particles could dictate the relative importance of different atmospheric transport mechanisms raupach et al 2001 small airborne particles are transported mainly by deposition rather than rain splash while larger particles are typically moved vertically due to horizontal transport within the 1 2 m range where we found the highest concentrations of microplastics the same processes are relevant for airborne microplastics thus the variation in microplastic concentration on canopy near scm could be a result of changes in wind flow patterns induced by the canopy beckett et al 2000 and from the variation in trapping efficiency of the different vegetation types chaudhary and rathore 2018 sæbø et al 2012 wang et al 2013 these differential velocity patterns can result in the differential deposition of particles at different heights along with the canopy gonzales et al 2018 5 conclusions analyzing the distribution of microplastics in and around scm at fourteen locations in los angeles we show that microplastic concentrations inside and outside of scm are not statistically different the result indicates that in addition to stormwater the atmospheric deposition could be a dominant source of microplastics in urban areas a high concentration of microplastics in vegetation around scm confirmed this theory the results reveal the importance of wind transport and dry deposition on the accumulation of plastics in urban areas which have implications on the source proportion of microplastics at any location thus an accurate inventory of microplastics accumulated in scm must account for both stormwater and atmosphere as sources of microplastics irrespective of the source of accumulated microplastics in scm most microplastics were trapped in the top 5 cm subsurface layers of the scm and their concentration exponentially decreased with depth the retardation coefficient which was estimated by fitting the exponential model and estimating the exponent term increased with a decrease in median particle size d50 of subsurface soil this result indicates that straining is the dominant removal process of the microplastics outside the scm the retardation coefficient however did not change with changes in d50 within scm boundary indicating pre contamination of filter media with microplastics and enhanced downward transport of microplastics in filter media in scm may have moved the accumulated microplastics deeper into the subsurface overall the study not only offers a critical analysis of microplastic concentrations both within and outside of scm that reveals straining as the dominant removal process in subsurface but also provides evidence confirming the significant contribution of atmospheric deposition on the accumulation of microplastics in scm however there are a few limitations of the study which are largely derived from the assumptions made in identifying microplastics and using the exponential model microplastics identified in the method excluded any plastic particles that do not absorb nile red or glow after absorbing the dye similarly the empirical exponential model used here to compare retardation or retention of microplastics between scm may not be applied to small microplastics 1 µm due to their increased transport without straining the optical method used in this study has a size detection limit of 10 µm thus the conclusions are applied to microplastics larger than 10 µm declaration of competing interest none acknowledgment the authors are grateful for the financial support

16368,stormwater control measures scm can remove and accumulate microplastics and may serve as a long term source of microplastics for groundwater pollution because of their potential for downward mobility in subsurface furthermore the number of microplastics accumulated in scm may have been underestimated as the calculation typically only accounts for microplastics accumulated via episodic stormwater loading and ignores microplastic accumuation via continuous atmospheric deposition to evaluate the source pathways of accumulated microplastics and their potential for downward mobility to groundwater we analyzed spatial distributions of microplastics above ground on the canopy around scm and below ground in the subsurface in and outside the boundaries of fourteen scm in los angeles using an exponential model we link subsurface retardation of microplastics to the median particle size of soil d50 and land use despite receiving significantly more stormwater microplastic concentrations in scm at surface depth or subsurface depth were not significantly different from the concentration at the same depth outside the scm similar concentration in and outside of scm indicates that stormwater is not the sole source of microplastics accumulated in scm the high concentration of microplastics on leaves of vegetation in scm confirms that the contribution of atmospheric deposition is significant within and outside the scm boundary microplastics are removed within the top 5 cm of the subsurface and their concentration decreases exponentially with depth indicating limited potential for groundwater pollution from the microplastics accumulated in scm outside the scm boundary the subsurface retardation coefficient decreases with increases in d50 indicating straining of microplastics as the dominant removal mechanism inside the boundary of scm however the retardation coefficient was independent of d50 implying that microplastics could have either moved deeper into the filter layer in scm or that compost mulch or organic amendments used in the filter media were pre contaminated with microplastics overall these results provide insights on microplastics source accumulation and downward mobility in scm keywords subsurface urban runoff green infrastructure straining biofilters dry deposition canopy trapping 1 introduction microplastics from urban compartments including trash or litter roads knight et al 2020 kole et al 2017 biosolid applied land crossman et al 2020 koutnik et al 2021a landfills he et al 2019 su et al 2019 and soils rafique et al 2020 su et al 2020 are washed off by stormwater moruzzi et al 2020 müller et al 2020 piñon colin et al 2020 and enter surface waters leslie et al 2017 treilles et al 2021 thus stormwater control measures scm which are typically used to reduce runoff and remove stormwater pollutants including sediments can capture these microplastics liu et al 2019 smyth et al 2021 and minimize pollution downstream however accumulated microplastics in scm can also disintegrate over time andrady 2011 zhang et al 2021 and the smaller microplastics could migrate downward through the subsurface to groundwater if their transport is not retarded by the filter media in scm the risk of groundwater pollution also depends on the total amount of microplastics accumulated in scm and the fraction of which are available for downward mobilization thus it is critical to account for all the pathways that contribute to microplastic inventory in scm and examine their downward mobility potential towards groundwater stormwater runoff is typically assumed to be the main source of microplastics in the scm liu et al 2019 werbowski et al 2021 even though atmospheric deposition can be a significant source brahney et al 2020 dris et al 2016 unlike stormwater loading which is episodic and happens a few times a year in response to precipitation events atmospheric deposition is continuous throughout the year thus net loading via atmospheric deposition could add up to a significant amount other studies have examined atmospheric transport of microplastics mbachu et al 2020 roblin et al 2020 wang et al 2021 and some of which could deposit in the scm smyth et al 2021 several studies have examined microplastic concentration in soil or filter media in scm boni et al 2021 gilbreath et al 2019 lange et al 2021 smyth et al 2021 but they did not examine the concentration of microplastics accumulated on the vegetation vegetation canopy can intercept microplastics liu et al 2020 sun et al 2021 and contribute to the net inventory of microplastics in scm high concentrations of microplastics are frequently found in the dust abbasi et al 2019 koutnik et al 2021b zhang et al 2020 which can be transported by wind bullard et al 2021 rezaei et al 2019 and redistributed in urban areas as microplastics concentration in the canopy in scm can serve as an indicator of microplastics deposition from the atmosphere it is critical to estimate microplastic concentration trapped by vegetation on scm the extent to which the accumulated microplastics can move downward in scm in field conditions has not been evaluated despite earlier evidence of subsurface mobility of microplastics during intermittent infiltration of rainwater mohanty et al 2015a microplastic removal and transport processes in scm can be inferred from the knowledge of particulate transport or removal mechanisms in the scm tirpak et al 2021 microplastics similar to particles or sediments can be removed by settling adsorption and filtration from stormwater gavrić et al 2019 massoudieh et al 2017 although most microplastics owing to their large size are expected to be filtered out in topsoil luo et al 2020 smaller microplastics could potentially migrate downward with infiltrating stormwater previous studies have shown that microspheres of size greater than 2 µm are retarded rapidly with limited transport potential gao et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 furthermore pm10 or particulate matter with a size less than 10 µm is relevant for air transport as any larger particles are less likely to be relevant for long range transport and disposition on scm by the wind the hydraulic conductivity and porosity of the filter layer in scm are typically high to facilitate a faster infiltration tirpak et al 2021 which can also enhance the downward migration of microplastics furthermore scms are exposed to intermittent infiltration of stormwater or dry wet cycles which could accelerate the downward migration of microplastics in the subsurface mohanty et al 2015b o connor et al 2019 however a lack of depth distribution data from scm where microplastics have been accumulated for years precludes our understanding of the vertical migration of microplastics in scm the study aims to evaluate the contribution of atmospheric deposition on the net accumulation of microplastics in scm and examine the downward mobility potential of the accumulated microplastics to achieve the objectives we measured the below and above ground distribution of microplastics in locations within and outside scm boundary and fit below ground distribution data to an exponential retardation model with the median particle size of soil d50 to evaluate the importance of straining on the removal of microplastics from infiltrating stormwater the result informs the potential of scm to serve as a long term source or sink of microplastics 2 methods 2 1 soil sample collection from scm to compare the concentration of microplastics within and outside the physical boundary of scm we collected soils from fourteen scm in los angeles on may 20th and 21st 2021 fig 1 which was more than 2 months after the last recorded rainfall in the area scm are categorized for their type and the surrounding environment or land use table s1 the five location types were driveways and parking lots residential areas with single family homes and low traffic neighborhood streets commercial areas with medium traffic streets near business establishments high traffic areas beside freeways and a natural area beside a river drainage pipe near clusters of trees and bushes locations outside the scm boundary did not have stormwater inlets and were hydraulically disconnected from the scm with a distance of 2 to 15 m away from the scm boundary thus most microplastics found outside the scm boundary were assumed to be from atmospheric deposition by comparing microplastics concentrations within and outside the scm boundary we evaluated the importance of atmospheric deposition the below ground concentration of microplastics was estimated by collecting soil samples from the surface and subsurface to collect soil samples a stainless steel hand auger with a diameter of 2 5 cm was inserted into the subsurface to a depth of 10 cm at three random spots inside and outside the boundary of scm from the auger soils were extracted by a stainless steel spatula into aluminum foil from two depths 0 2 cm surface and 8 10 cm subsurface wherever the soil was impenetrable beyond the top layer due to rocks or hard packed soil only surface samples were collected the core was thoroughly cleaned between sampling to prevent cross contamination to determine the spatial distribution of microplastics at high resolution both under and above ground one roadside bioswale was sampled extensively this location was extensively sampled to compare the below ground concentration profile in soil and above ground on vegetation canopy leaves were collected at different elevations from 0 15 m to 2 5 m from two plant species at one location and wrapped individually in aluminum foil to prevent cross contamination to determine the spatial distribution of microplastics on the surface of the soil layer samples were collected at 1 2 3 and 4 meters from the inlet in addition four 22 5 cm cores were collected near the inlet of the scm and soil samples were extracted from different depths at 2 5 cm increments to examine how the particle size of subsurface soil can affect the downward migration of microplastics we measured the particle size distribution of subsurface samples 8 10 cm a portion of soil from subsurface samples at a site was mixed to create a composite sample which was first sieved using a 2 mm sieve to remove any gravel the sieved sample was mixed with water to create a slurry and the size distribution of soil particles suspended in a liquid aqueous liquid module alm was measured using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer ls 13320 beckman coulter inc ca usa 2 2 extraction and quantification of microplastics in soil samples microplastics were isolated from soil samples by density separation cutroneo et al 2021 briefly 1 0 gram of soil sample was mixed in 40 ml of 1 6 g ml 1 ki solution in a 50 ml centrifuge tube and the mixture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 min to settle heavier soil particles from lighter density 1 6 g cm 3 particles that include microplastics and organic debris mu et al 2019 the supernatant was vacuum filtrated to trap floating debris on a filter paper 50 mm whatman cellulose filter 0 45 µm pore size and the residue from the filter paper was diluted by washing off the debris from the first filter paper into a glass beaker using 100 ml of di water 10 ml of the samples were pipetted using glass pipettes onto a vacuum filtration setup fitted with a 24 mm glass fiber filter paper with 1 2 μm pore size thermo fisher scientific a method blank was obtained where di water was processed through all the steps to estimate any microplastics introduced from the materials used during the extraction steps the concentration of microplastics on the filter paper was quantified by coloring microplastics with nile red and counting the colored particles by image processing as demonstrated in many studies erni cassola et al 2017 shim et al 2016 tamminga et al 2017 in this study we stained the filters containing floating debris with 0 17 ml of 0 5 µg ml 1 nile red in chloroform solution maes et al 2017 in a glass petri dish and air dried with a glass cover for 24 h in the fume hood dried filter membranes were transferred onto glass slides covered with a glass coverslip to eliminate dust deposition and imaged using a smartphone based fluorescence microscope the detailed method for sample preparation and counting is described in the supplementary material it should be noted that optical detection relies on the sensitivity and selectivity of nile red to bind microplastics thus the method is susceptible to all limitations discovered in other studies that have used nile red some microplastics such as tire particles may not have been detected if they do not absorb nile red however our preliminary study confirmed that our method was able to detect the most common microplastics in the mixture containing compost or mulch which are the primary source of organics in the biofilter we did not analyze the size or shape distribution of microplastics detected the method can detect microplastics as small as 10 µm due to a large field of view of 490 mm2 the largest size of microplastic observed in our study is 2 25 mm 2 3 the concentration of microplastics on leaves to quantify the number of microplastics per unit surface area of leaves collected leaves were cut using metal scissors into a rectangular shape so that surface area could be measured the debris from the leaves was washed with 100 ml of di water into a glass beaker and each leaf was sonicated inside the respective beaker in 100 ml of water for 30 min after sonication the microplastics suspension was vacuum filtrated onto a 24 mm g4 glass fiber membrane the membranes were then dyed with nile red and dried as described above blank or pre washed leaves were also dyed to ensure there are no fluorescent particles on the leaves without microplastics 2 4 quality assurance and quality control for sampling storage and processing pre washed non plastic containers were used all clean glassware and containers were rinsed with di water three times the di water was analyzed for possible microplastic contamination triplicate samples from 14 sites were collected to get a wide distribution of data each sample was mixed thoroughly and a representative 1 gram of each of those samples was analyzed for microplastics concentration a total of 140 environmental soil samples were analyzed including replicates no field blanks were collected as the samples were taken from the subsurface using clean tools we have performed laboratory blanks to account for any cross contamination in addition during every day of analysis a method blank was run following the same lab procedure as sample analysis the mean laboratory blank for sediment samples was 5 pieces and the mean for leaf samples was 6 pieces table s2 the mean of laboratory blanks for each method was subtracted from the measured concentration of samples to account for any microplastics introduced from any material used we performed a recovery test using our method where water samples containing a known number of microplastics were processed table s3 the test resulted in an average recovery rate of 93 7 13 7 table s4 to check how different processing steps influence the quantification result two variability tests were performed human processing variation was found to be 6 8 of the mean and the sample processing variation was 9 1 table s4 therefore the total maximum error for each of the microplastic measurements was estimated to be 22 2 2 5 subsurface microplastics retention profile microplastics removal can be modeled similarly to the removal of colloids or sediments large articles 5 µm are typically removed by settling or straining and removal of particles larger than 10 µm is dominated by straining as they are blocked by narrow pores the typical pore size in biofilter is around 30 µm and the minimum size microplastics that can be detected were of 10 µm size thus we assumed straining to be the dominant mechanism and used an empirical equation with an exponential function similar to gao et al 2021 c z c 0 e k z where c and c 0 are microplastic concentrations p g 1 at depth z cm and on the surface respectively and k is the retardation coefficient thus k is estimated by the fitting depth and concentration data into the model the retardation coefficient is different from the commonly used retardation factor which is estimated by comparing the velocity of water with the velocity of contaminant based on the breakthrough curves in our case breakthrough curves were not obtained due to the complete filtration of microplastics in the biofilter thus estimated k includes absorption straining gravity settling and removal by any other mechanism microplastics are expected to be removed by physical filtration or straining where the removal or straining rate can increase with increasing colloid size and decreasing median grain size d50 bradford et al 2003 the exponential model was verified at one site and the same was assumed for other sites the assumption is based on the result of a previous study that found that microplastic penetration depth is sensitive to the ratio of the size of microplastics and grain diameter in biofilter and that 10 µm or larger microplastics would have shallow penetration depth in porous media relevant for stormwater biofilter waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2020 as the size detection limit of microplastics in our study is 10 µm our observation is limited to larger 10 µm microplastics thus caution should be maintained when extrapolating our results to smaller microplastics 1 µm which can be more mobile 2 6 statistical analysis to calculate the statistical difference in concentration of microplastics in and outside the scm a wilcoxon rank sum test was performed r version 4 0 0 with notation signifying p value 0 05 meaning p value 0 01 and ns showing the data is not statistically significant we use a linear model lm function in r to estimate the standard error the 95 confidence interval was estimated by using t statistics 3 results 3 1 microplastic concentrations inside and outside of scm are similar the spatial distribution of microplastics within and outside of scm reveals that the concentration of microplastics within the scm boundary is similar p 0 05 to the concentration outside the boundary fig 2 microplastic concentrations in samples varied between 0 and 2784 particles per gram of soil p g 1 based on location and depth of soil in particular the concentration decreased with subsurface depth in all locations concentration in surface samples was significantly higher than the concentration in subsurface samples irrespective of the locations within or outside scm boundary the mean microplastic concentration outside scm was 283 p g 1 for the top surface and 82 p g 1 for subsurface samples inside scm the mean concentration was 472 p g 1 for the top surface and 149 p g 1 for subsurface samples 3 2 subsurface microplastic concentration decreases exponentially with depth analysis of microplastic concentration at five depths at one scm reveals that microplastic concentration decreases exponentially with depth fig 3 based on the exponential fit with the mean concentration of microplastics at different depths we estimated the mean retardation coefficient k at this location to be 0 13 k value from the whole data set is 0 18 with a standard error of 0 64 and a 95 confidence interval from 0 11 to 0 50 3 3 plant leaves around scm contained a high concentration of microplastics leaves collected at different heights from the ground contained high concentrations of microplastics ranging from 0 to 66 p cm 2 fig 4 the concentration on leaves initially increased with height reaching maximum values around 1 5 m above the ground above this height an increase in height decreased the concentration of microplastics 3 4 retardation coefficients are similar between location types assuming an exponential decrease in the concentration of microplastics with depth in all other locations we calculated retardation coefficients k for all locations and the retardation coefficients were independent of location type or land use fig 5 a to check if the median particle size d50 affects the retardation coefficient as it does for straining coefficient bradford et al 2003 we compared the correlation of retardation coefficient with d50 inside and outside scm with an increase in soil particle size d50 retardation coefficient decreases outside the scm indicating filtration or straining is the dominant retention mechanism outside scm in contrast inside scm no such correlation was observed fig 5b 4 discussion 4 1 microplastics are retained within the top 5 cm of subsurface vertical profiles of microplastic concentrations in scm reveal that scm is effective in filtering most microplastics from stormwater and the majority are retained within the top 5 cm layer fig 2 the trend is consistent in locations outside the scm indicating subsurface soil is an effective barrier to filter microplastics from runoff and could prevent groundwater pollution with microplastics the result is expected based on the previous understanding of particle mobility in the subsurface soil particles greater than 10 µm are expected to be filtered out in soil by settling and straining or physical filtration bradford et al 2003 chu et al 2019 tong et al 2020 waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2020 however microplastics accumulated on the surface can become disintegrated by uv radiation song et al 2017 weinstein et al 2016 or biodegradation gonzález pleiter et al 2019 kalogerakis et al 2017 releasing much smaller microplastics that may have higher mobility pelley and tufenkji 2008 sirivithayapakorn and keller 2003 than the ones detected in most studies furthermore microplastics are of different shapes such as rod fragment and sphere which can influence their transport ma et al 2020 waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2020 future studies should examine the influence of microplastic shapes on their mobility in stormwater treatment systems we estimated the retardation coefficient in all locations assuming an exponential decrease in the concentration of microplastics with depth we also observed that the mean retardation coefficient in scm is slightly lower than the mean retardation coefficient outside of scm fig s3a indicating some microplastics are more likely to transport deeper into the subsurface in scm than outside scm we attributed this to the pore size distribution of subsurface media and the infiltration rate of stormwater infiltration based scm typically uses sand or sandy soil which has a higher porosity and hydraulic conductivity than the native soil tirpak et al 2021 however d50 outside scm applears slightly higher than that inside scm although not statistically significant fig s3b thus it is expected that the microplastics may move deeper into the subsurface in scm than they would outside scm furthermore microplastic transport in subsurface soil can be enhanced by intermittent infiltration of stormwater mohanty et al 2015b which typically occurs in scm subsurface soil or filter layer in scm is naturally subjected to dry wet cycles and freeze thaw cycles mohanty et al 2014 2015b which can release colloids and accmulated pollutants borthakur et al 2021a b recent studies show that dry wet cycles accelerate the downward migration of microplastics gao et al 2021 o connor et al 2019 although most microplastics are found within a depth of up to 7 5 cm even after extensive weathering and dry wet cycles o connor et al 2019 rillig et al 2017 in our study the scm are 5 years or older and have been subjected to various weathering cycles and have accumulated microplastics for many years thus we assume that the concentration profile is at a semi steady state overall our results show that the top 5 cm of soil in scm removes microplastics from stormwater and potentially prevents groundwater pollution however this finding could have other unexplored consequences for instance accumulated microplastics can adsorb pollutants from stormwater aghilinasrollahabadi et al 2020 and become suspended by wind thereby posing an inhalation risk borthakur et al 2021 in addition a high concentration of microplastics in the top 5 cm of subsurface where roots are concentrated could affect biochemical processes in the root zone de souza machado et al 2018 van weert et al 2019 thus future studies should quantify the impact of accumulated microplastics on the functions of scm 4 2 straining is the dominant removal mechanism for microplastics outside scm filter medium composition particularly particle size distribution varies widely in the scm tirpak et al 2021 which can affect the removal of microplastics or their downward mobility in this study we compared how the retardation coefficient changes with median particle size d50 both inside and outside scm an increase in retardation coefficient with a decrease in d50 of soil outside scm indicates that straining is a dominant removal mechanism for microplastics in subsurface soil fig 5a straining is particularly expected for large particles where the passage of particles through narrow pores is blocked auset and keller 2006 bradford et al 2006 there is no exception for microplastics the size detection limit of this study is 10 µm scm are typically composed of sandy soil with a mean pore radius of 32 µm ding et al 2019 indicating microplastics in the same size range can be filtered out by physical straining unlike soil coarse sand could permit the passage of large microplastics due to large pore size analyzing sediment size distribution in influent and effluent of model biofilter packed with the sand column a previous study found that nearly 99 of the sediments with size 10 µm were filtered out by straining valenca et al 2020 for the same reason the penetration depth of 10 µm size microplastics was observed to be below 10 cm waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2020 typical depth of filter layer in scm is over 30 cm thus we assumed that the probability of microplastics passing through the entire filter layer is very small the retardation coefficient did not decrease with an increase in median particle size of filter media in scm fig 5b the results suggest that the concentrations of microplastics in deeper layers of scm are higher than that predicted by the exponential retardation model there could be several reasons for this discrepancy first filter layer in scm typically consists of a mixture of sand and mulch compost or other organic amendments tirpak et al 2021 which may contain microplastics watteau et al 2018 weithmann et al 2018 thus the microplastics found in deeper layers may have been introduced by the amendments used during the installation of the scm second bioturbation could play a significant role in moving nanoplastics in scm via injection heinze et al 2021 and microplastics via the preferential flow paths created by earthworms yu et al 2019 the extent of these processes in different scm could vary third the infiltration rate in the scm is high to prevent overland flow which could facilitate the relocation of microplastics from the surface layer into deeper layers if pore sizes are bigger than microplastic size previous studies demonstrated enhanced transport of colloids or particles with an increase in flow rate through porous media kretzschmar et al 1999 a similar process could also enhance the transport of microplastics in scm most scm are designed by replacing soil with sand to increase hydraulic conductivity tirpak et al 2021 which could increase relative pore size and enhance the transport of small microplastics in our study we could not distinguish whether enhanced transport in filter media or pre contamination from filter media is the cause of a relatively high concentration of microplastics in deeper subsurface layers thus future studies should screen the typical amendments for microplastic contamination before their use in the scm and examine the subsurface distribution profile of microplastics after many years of stormwater infiltration 4 3 the atmosphere is a significant source of microplastics accumulated in scm understanding the source and the processes by which microplastics may accumulate in scm can help assess whether scm can become a long term source of microplastics for groundwater pollution and be an effective strategy to prevent redistribution of microplastics in the environment while it is typically assumed that stormwater is a dominant source of microplastics found in scm our study shows that contribution of atmospheric deposition is just as important although the mean microplastic concentration appears to be higher inside scm than outside of scm the difference is not statistically significant fig 2 thus despite receiving more stormwater runoff scm did not accumulate more microplastics than the location outside scm this result indicates that stormwater is not the only source of microplastics accumulated in the scm and atmospheric deposition both wet and dry is also a significant source of microplastics in urban areas this result confirmed the finding of another study where field blanks were found to have a high concentration of microplastics smyth et al 2021 atmospheric dry deposition is particularly significant in dry climates abbasi and turner 2021 the los angeles area where the sampled scm are located does not receive regular or frequent rainfall which could result in scm receiving lower amounts of stormwater than the scm located in wet climates sadeghi et al 2019 thus most microplastics deposited on land could be via dry deposition or wind which occurs throughout the year transport of waterborne microplastics is event based and is associated with intense rainfall while deposition of airborne microplastics is continuous throughout the year thus we surmise that continuous deposition of microplastics in dry seasons throughout the year may have overshadowed any high amount of microplastics deposited in sporadic runoff events one may argue that flooding after high intensity rainfalls could redistribute microplastics beyond the scm by overflow daly et al 2012 sanders and grant 2020 in many of the sampling sites in our study however the locations outside the boundary are at a higher elevation above the curb where floodwater would rarely reach our result indicates that atmospheric deposition or wind blown microplastics could be a significant source of microplastics accumulated in scm the presence of microplastics on leaves of vegetation around scm further confirmed this hypothesis dust can be deposited on leaves via dry deposition falling off from the sky interception of wind horizontal transport or rain splash from the ground surface gonzales et al 2018 the same processes are also relevant for the transport and deposition of airborne microplastics if dry deposition is the dominant process the concentration of microplastics should be higher on leaves at high elevations in contrast we found that the concentration on leaves was lower at the 2 5 m height and was the highest at 1 5 m height fig 4 the size of microplastics similar to any other airborne particles could dictate the relative importance of different atmospheric transport mechanisms raupach et al 2001 small airborne particles are transported mainly by deposition rather than rain splash while larger particles are typically moved vertically due to horizontal transport within the 1 2 m range where we found the highest concentrations of microplastics the same processes are relevant for airborne microplastics thus the variation in microplastic concentration on canopy near scm could be a result of changes in wind flow patterns induced by the canopy beckett et al 2000 and from the variation in trapping efficiency of the different vegetation types chaudhary and rathore 2018 sæbø et al 2012 wang et al 2013 these differential velocity patterns can result in the differential deposition of particles at different heights along with the canopy gonzales et al 2018 5 conclusions analyzing the distribution of microplastics in and around scm at fourteen locations in los angeles we show that microplastic concentrations inside and outside of scm are not statistically different the result indicates that in addition to stormwater the atmospheric deposition could be a dominant source of microplastics in urban areas a high concentration of microplastics in vegetation around scm confirmed this theory the results reveal the importance of wind transport and dry deposition on the accumulation of plastics in urban areas which have implications on the source proportion of microplastics at any location thus an accurate inventory of microplastics accumulated in scm must account for both stormwater and atmosphere as sources of microplastics irrespective of the source of accumulated microplastics in scm most microplastics were trapped in the top 5 cm subsurface layers of the scm and their concentration exponentially decreased with depth the retardation coefficient which was estimated by fitting the exponential model and estimating the exponent term increased with a decrease in median particle size d50 of subsurface soil this result indicates that straining is the dominant removal process of the microplastics outside the scm the retardation coefficient however did not change with changes in d50 within scm boundary indicating pre contamination of filter media with microplastics and enhanced downward transport of microplastics in filter media in scm may have moved the accumulated microplastics deeper into the subsurface overall the study not only offers a critical analysis of microplastic concentrations both within and outside of scm that reveals straining as the dominant removal process in subsurface but also provides evidence confirming the significant contribution of atmospheric deposition on the accumulation of microplastics in scm however there are a few limitations of the study which are largely derived from the assumptions made in identifying microplastics and using the exponential model microplastics identified in the method excluded any plastic particles that do not absorb nile red or glow after absorbing the dye similarly the empirical exponential model used here to compare retardation or retention of microplastics between scm may not be applied to small microplastics 1 µm due to their increased transport without straining the optical method used in this study has a size detection limit of 10 µm thus the conclusions are applied to microplastics larger than 10 µm declaration of competing interest none acknowledgment the authors are grateful for the financial support

16369,little is known about the genomic diversity of the microbial communities associated with raw municipal wastewater sewage including whether microbial populations specific to sewage exist and how such populations could be used to improve source attribution and apportioning in contaminated waters herein we used the influent of three wastewater treatment plants in atlanta georgia usa to perturb laboratory freshwater mesocosms simulating sewage contamination events and followed these mesocosms with shotgun metagenomics over a 7 day observational period we describe 15 abundant non redundant bacterial metagenome assembled genomes mags ubiquitous within all sewage inocula yet absent from the unperturbed freshwater control at our analytical limit of detection tracking the dynamics of the populations represented by these mags revealed varied decay kinetics depending on inferred phenotypes e g anaerobes decayed faster than aerobes under the well aerated incubation conditions notably a portion of these populations showed decay patterns similar to those of common markers enterococcus and hf183 despite the apparent decay of these populations the abundance of β lactamase encoding genes remained high throughout incubation relative to the control lastly we constructed genomic libraries representing several different fecal sources and outline a bioinformatic approach which leverages these libraries for identifying and apportioning contamination signal among multiple probable sources using shotgun metagenomic data graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords source tracking metagenomics sewage collection systems wastewater microbial ecology water quality 1 introduction wastewater collection systems or simply collection systems represent an important engineering control for the collection of human feces commercial or industrial wastewaters and sometimes stormwater particularly in certain urban settings the operation and maintenance of collection systems pose unique challenges often due to their size complexity and capital costs salman et al 2012 berendes et al 2018 mclellan et al 2018 population growth and distribution changes especially growing urbanization trends highlight the importance of maintaining and expanding efficient collection systems for an increasing fraction of the global population ten veldhuis et al 2010 severe weather pipe blockages aging and other issues of system failure can lead to the accidental release of untreated wastewater sewage from collection systems into waterways or floodwaters salman et al 2012 berendes et al 2018 mclellan et al 2018 olds et al 2018 as sewage is a significant reservoir of both chemical and biological pollutants its release into the environment poses serious environmental and human health risks including potential exposure to human pathogens ashbolt et al 2010 fouz et al 2020 medina et al 2020 eisenberg et al 2016 and possible dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes args among microbial populations su et al 2020 kessler 2011 lira et al 2020 microbial source tracking mst refers to a collection of forensic tools developed to identify the presence and source of contamination among multiple probable fecal sources including sewage harwood et al 2014 in large part the technical approaches behind mst methods have been developed in response to both the difficulty of assaying for the diverse array of relevant human pathogens as well as the practical need to keep methods relatively rapid and inexpensive existing approaches have relied on indicator organisms to imply the presence of fecal pollution and sometimes as proxies for the presence of human pathogens in contaminated waters specifically fecal indicator bacteria fib include an aggregation of bacterial populations considered representatives of microbial communities inhabiting the guts of warm blooded animals widely used indicator organisms include escherichia coli and enterococcus spp more recently mst genetic markers from distinct bacterial lineages have been used that leverage known host specificity of distinct populations for source attribution bernhard et al 2000 some markers e g the hf183 primer targeting a human associated bacteroides clade have found effective use in environmental management strategies as the basis for inferring the amount of sewage present and thereby a potential array of pathogen concentrations for iterative risk assessment simulations boehm et al 2015 yet the use of fib and mst gene markers has had challenges most notably that the concentration of most markers are rarely found to co vary with pathogen concentrations marker concentrations fluctuate with sewage age and the capability of fib to adapt to environmental conditions can all combine to confound results interpretation harwood et al 2014 korajkic et al 2018 ahmed et al 2016 2019 devane et al 2020 in recent years targeted metabarcoding methods have examined sewage and sewage contaminated waters via the 16s rrna gene or the internal transcribed spacer its for prokaryotes and fungi respectively ahmed et al 2016 unno et al 2018 mclellan and eren 2014 assress et al 2019 these studies have revealed a distinct sewage microbiome dominated by taxa that proliferate in collection systems sometimes far beyond the abundance of human gut associated populations newton et al 2015 mclellan and roguet 2019 mclellan et al 2010 however these single gene assays offer limited resolution to distinguish between environmental or non environmental strains of the same species due to conservation of the rrna gene or the its region likewise these methods do not provide information about the gene content associated with important populations e g emergent pathogens args present or resolve finer community wide compositional shifts ahmed et al 2016 poretsky et al 2014 therefore rrna gene based approaches are limited with respect to quantifying health risks associated with the detection of biomarkers or guide the development of more holistic environmental management criteria e g site specific criteria whole genome shotgun sequencing or metagenomics which recovers fragments of the genomes in a sample have revealed that bacteria and archaea predominantly form sequence discrete populations with intra population genomic sequence relatedness typically ranging from approximately 95 to 100 average nucleotide identity ani depending on the population considered a level that the 16s rrna gene cannot often assess caro quintero and konstantinidis 2012 rodriguez r et al 2021 metagenomic approaches offer unique advantages for environmental health monitoring tasks including 1 extensive gene content information of abundant populations 2 precise ecological estimates of relative abundance at the species level and 3 examination of intra species diversity segata 2018 despite its potential for circumventing some of the challenges facing existing mst and metabarcoding methods whole genome shotgun sequencing has not been utilized in monitoring municipal sewage pollution to date metagenomic applications have focused on understanding the microbiology of biological wastewater treatment treated effluents and their receiving waters or viral populations lira et al 2020 cai and zhang 2013 bibby and peccia 2013 in part this is because it remains unclear how to best merge the methods and bioinformatics behind metagenomic practices with existing mst and environmental monitoring paradigms hong et al 2020 widespread application of this technology in the field requires that several outstanding issues be resolved including the detection limits of metagenomic analyses whether whole and or metagenome assembled genomes mags can serve as source specific fecal contamination markers and how metagenomic approaches can infer the relative contribution of various fecal inputs referred to hereafter as source apportioning here we offer a metagenomic perspective on sewage related bacterial populations and explore their relationships with culture and pcr based markers during a simulated failure of a collection system i e spill specifically we simulated sewage contamination events in lake water obtained from a local drinking water and recreational use reservoir within dialysis bag laboratory mesocosms that were incubated in the dark for one week shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed to search for potential sewage specific biomarkers test the effectiveness of genome collections for fecal source attribution and apportioning and directly screen for both pathogens and antimicrobial resistance genes we further support these aims by developing and testing a theoretical analytical limit of detection which can help guide the future application and interpretation of metagenomics to these issues 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and mesocosm operation samples were collected in sterile glass 1 l bottles from the primary influent of three wwtps located in the atlanta metropolitan region of georgia usa to serve as representatives of sewage across three different sewersheds each sewershed was comprised of collection systems with separate stormwater and wastewater conveyance i e separate sewers approximately 50 l of surface water from lake lanier georgia was also collected concurrently hereafter these sample groups are referred to as sewersheds a b and c all sewage and water samples were immediately transported to the lab and stored in darkness at 4 c until mesocosm setup which occurred within 24 h for mesocosm setup 40 l tanks were filled with lake water and a pump installed for aeration experimental dialysis bags were prepared with 110 ml 10 v v sewage and lake water mixture and control bags were filled with 110 ml uninoculated lake water and closed on both ends using polypropylene spectra por clamps spectrum laboratories both experimental n 12 3 sewersheds 36 bags and control n 12 bags dialysis bags were then added to the tank a small headspace of air was left in each bag when sealing with clamps so that they could float freely in the tank dialysis bag pore sizes 6 8 kda molecular weight cutoff permit the transport of small molecules and ions but bacterial and viral particles are contained within the bags mesocosms were kept in darkness at 22 c throughout the duration of the experiment sampling occurred at 1 4 and 7 days by retrieving experimental and control bags from the mesocosm for destructive processing 2 2 culturing dna purification qpcr and shotgun sequencing epa method 1600 usepa 2009 was followed for enumerating volumetric enterococcus cfus three replicates of each sample were diluted 10 fold and then plated in duplicate all dilutions yielding measurements within an acceptable range for counting were averaged to estimate cfus 100 ml for a sample mesocosm sampling dna extraction and subsequent qpcr analysis occurred as described previously in suttner et al suttner et al 2021 briefly water samples were passed through 0 45 μm pore size polycarbonate pc membranes and stored at 80 c in 2 ml screw cap bead tubes until processed within 1 3 months dna was extracted from pc membranes using the qiagen powerfecal kit following the manufacturer s instructions with only one exception mechanical cell lysis was performed by bead beating in two 1 minute intervals using the biospec mini beadbeater 24 with icing between intervals these dna extractions were used as template for qpcr with the hf183 bfdrev assay wade et al 2010 and a universal 16s rrna gene qpcr assay genbac16s to quantify 16s rrna gene copies across samples ritalahti et al 2006 metagenomic sequencing was performed using the illumina nextera xt kit with library average insert size determined on an agilent 2100 instrument using a hs dna kit and library concentrations determined using the qubit 1x dsdna assay samples were then pooled and sequenced on the hiseq 2500 instrument as described previously johnston et al 2019 all qpcr reactions were run using an applied biosystems 7500 fast thermocycler and the cycling parameters were as follows 2 min at 50 c 10 min at 95 c and 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 c and 60 s at 60 c assay reactions used 2 μl of template dna in 20 μl qpcr reactions with the taqman universal pcr master mix applied biosystems the primer and probe concentrations were 0 25 μm for hf183 assay and 0 3 μm for the bac16s assay template dnas were run diluted 5 fold to remove the effect of pcr inhibitors based on the expected marker concentration and quality of each sample further details on qpcr reaction set up and standard plasmids for absolute quantification are provided in suttner et al 2021 and reiterated within supporting information si table s1 to test for extraneous dna and potential contamination from sample handling 50 ml of sterile pbs was also filtered onto pc membranes and processed following the same dna extraction at every sampling time point as described above 2 3 sequence data analysis short reads were quality trimmed and nextera adapters removed with trimmomatic 0 39 bolger et al 2014 quality trimming was performed to remove poor quality bases along both ends of sequences and subsequent removal of any sequences below 50 bp in length k mer based operation of nonpareil 3 304 t kmer was used to estimate the fraction of alpha diversity covered by the sequencing effort of each metagenome rodriguez r et al 2018 beta diversity across trimmed short reads was assessed with the default settings of simka 1 5 1 based on bray curtis dissimilarity values and visualized by principal coordinate analysis pcoa benoit et al 2016 kraken2 was used to assign taxonomy and estimate simple relative abundance against a custom library including bacteria archaea viruses protozoa human and fungal reference genomes at the rank of class wood et al 2019 trimmed short reads were assembled individually with idba ud 1 1 3 and spades meta 3 14 0 using k mer sizes between 20 and 127 peng et al 2012 prjibelski et al 2020 contigs shorter than 3 kbp were removed prior to population genome binning which was performed with maxbin 2 2 7 and metabat 2 12 1 wu et al 2016 kang et al 2019 additionally in a parallel workflow trimmed short reads were normalized via the bbnorm function of the bbtools suite version 38 to bring depths between 10 and 30x sequencing depth and then subsequently assembled and binned as described above bushnell 2014 all resulting metagenome assembled genomes mags from both regular and depth normalized short read assemblies were dereplicated using miga 0 7 24 0 via the derep wf function rodriguez r et al 2018 groups of mags sharing ani 95 were clustered into species like populations hereafter populations with representative mags for each population selected by highest completeness and lowest redundancy populations with no representative mag having a miga quality score above 30 and or redundancies below 5 were excluded from further analysis both traitar 1 1 2 and microbeannotator were used with default settings to infer potential phenotypes and annotate draft genomes respectively weimann et al 2016 ruiz perez et al 2021 lastly mags were screened for cross reactivity using the fastani tool to search for other genomes with ani 95 across a suite of reference databases jain et al 2018 from the patric database version 3 6 9 1097 pathogenic bacterial genome accession ids were recovered by querying for host name human homo sapiens and good quality this included both genomes tagged as reference n 28 and representative n 1069 davis et al 2020 of these 1076 genomes were recoverable from ncbi for use in this study abundance estimates of pathogen genomes were assessed by competitive short read mapping with magic blast 1 4 0 splice f boratyn et al 2019 resulting alignments were filtered using minimum cut off of 70 bp alignment length 95 query coverage by alignment and 95 identity to avoid spurious matches additionally for virulence gene detection only experimentally verified nucleotide entries in the virulence factor database liu et al 2019 were used evaluating mag relative abundance across the time series was accomplished similarly using magic blast 1 4 0 where mags were concatenated into a single library to which reads were competitively mapped additionally diamond 2 0 1 blastx ultra sensitive was used to search short reads against the reference gene sequences of pre compiled 150 bp β lactamase rocker models to reliably identify short reads belonging to β lactamase encoding genes buchfink et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 reads mapping to these reference sequences were selected for best bit score alignment and subsequently filtered by rocker v1 5 2 as described previously orellana et al 2017 2 4 detection and quantification of metagenomic features for a reference genome mag or gene to be considered detected in a sample at least 10 of the target sequence was required to be covered by reads i e breadth of coverage hereafter c as proposed previously for robust detection of targets in metagenomic datasets castro et al 2018 or as written the analytical limit of detection lod used here 1 a n a l y t i c a l l o d c 0 1 the lod was automatically implemented by calculating sequencing depth and breadth similarly to rodriguez r et al 2020 for estimating truncated average depth at 80 hereafter the function tad80 python scripts used for this approach are available online at https github com rotheconrad 00 in situ genecoverage in short the tad80 function estimates sequencing depth by first sorting genomic positions according to their sequencing depth and then removing the upper 10 and lower 10 of positions before averaging the sequencing depth along the remaining 80 of positions since truncation of targets with breadth of coverage near the detection limits e g c 0 1 could introduce artificially lower values a quantification threshold was also necessary to avoid systemic underestimation of abundance for targets near lod from lander and waterman 1988 breadth of coverage c is related to sequencing depth ρ by the following 2 c 1 e ρ thus for the analytical lod defined above the expected sequencing depth ρ is simply ln 0 9 for targets at detectable limits we formalize a quantification threshold which measures whether a target is quantifiable following application of the truncation function tad80 with 3 q u a n t i f i c a t i o n t h r e s h o l d t a d 80 ρ ln 0 9 for simplicity in our metagenomic results we describe those targets which satisfied the lod condition but were below the quantification threshold as targets that were detected but not quantifiable dnq to convert relative abundance of detected target genomes to absolute abundances e g cells ml the following approach was used single copy gene coverage or genome equivalents geq and average genome size ags of metagenomes were evaluated using microbecensus 1 1 0 nayfach and pollard 2015 the 16s rrna gene carrying reads were identified and extracted using sortmerna 4 2 0 and the average 16s rrna gene coverage was estimated as the sum of extracted read lengths divided by 1540 bp the average length of the bacterial 16s rrna gene kopylova et al 2012 wang et al 2007 average 16s rrna gene copy number 16s acn for each metagenome was determined by the ratio between 16s rrna sequencing depth ρ 16s and geq 4 16 s r r n a a c n ρ 16 s g e q the copy number of the 16s rrna gene per ml as quantified by qpcr was divided by the 16s rrna acn to obtain an estimate for the number of cells in each sample assuming that one prokaryotic genome was approximately equivalent to one prokaryotic cell 5 e s t i m a t e d p r o k a r y o t i c c e l l d e n s i t y c e l l s m l 16 s r r n a c o p i e s m l 16 s r r n a a c n these measures were taken to help control for bias in relative abundance estimation due to changes in overall microbial load cells per volume and 16s rrna gene acn variation throughout the experiment lin and peddada 2020 morton et al 2019 finally absolute abundances were estimated by multiplying a population s genome equivalents by the estimate for the number of cells in a sample this was accomplished using the following equation for a given population via the truncated average sequencing depth tad80 ρ geq and total estimated

metagenomic based source attribution and apportioning approaches in short we collected reference genomes mags and isolate genomes from several large scale studies of host microbiomes these datasets included genomes gathered from the fecal microbiomes of humans n 4644 genomes pigs n 1667 genomes and chickens n 5675 and the rumen microbiome of cows n 2124 genomes almeida et al 2021 stewart et al 2019 gilroy et al 2021 chen et al 2021 mags produced in this study were also included as representatives of sewage sources detailed methods for the curation and dereplication of these collections are summarized in supporting information and visualized in si fig 6s lastly these libraries are hosted online for public use and download at http enve omics ce gatech edu data mst library 2 6 data

enterococcus and hf183 were in the same order of magnitude across the sewage samples gathered as inoculum for the mesocosms sewage from sewersheds a and b contained counts with averages of 3 7e 04 and 3 1e 04 enterococci cfus 100 ml and 2 4e 06 and 3 6e 06 hf183 copies ml respectively within sewershed c counts were lower having 1 3e 04 enterococci cfus 100 ml and 1 5e 06 hf183 copies ml similarly quantification of the 16s rrna gene copy number within the inoculum indicated that overall microbial loads were lower in sewershed c than sewersheds a and b at the time of sampling si fig s1 monitoring enterococci and hf183 qpcr markers across the mesocosm timeseries revealed that the markers decreased throughout the experiment in all replicates but were still detectable at day 7 and remained higher than the established or recommended water quality criteria for recreational use waters i e 36 cfus 100 ml and 41 hf183 copies ml usepa 2015 boehm et al 2018 only the hf183 marker within sewershed c mesocosm decreased below detection on day 7 fig 1 neither marker was detected in the un inoculated freshwater serving as control at any time point during mesocosm operation 3 2 estimated microbial load the estimated prokaryotic cell density of the inoculum varied based on quantification of the 16s rrna gene 1 1e 09 2 0e 09 and 1 8e 08 cells ml were estimated for sewersheds a b and c respectively following dilution and mixing of the inoculum into the mesocosms day 0 estimates for cell densities were 2 0e 07 1 7e 08 and 2 5e 07 cells ml thereafter cell density in both sewershed a and sewershed c mesocosm increased considerably in the first 24 h to 1 8e 08 and 6 9e 07 estimated cells ml a 924 and 275 increase while sewershed b decreased to 1 5e 08 cells ml subsequent time points revealed steady decreases in cell densities approaching the control cell density at day 7 of 7 9e 05 cells ml si table s2 3 3 metagenomic coverage and compositional shifts between 1 5 gbp to 3 5 gbp of data per sample remained following read quality trimming and adapter removal which corresponded to a range of 9 to 27 million reads sequencing effort covered between 36 and 67 of expected nucleotide diversity nd across all samples based on the nonpareil algorithm which estimates sequence coverage based on the degree of redundancy among the metagenomic reads available for each dataset rodriguez r et al 2018 this level of coverage is adequate for comparing the abundance of features e g genomes genes across samples rodriguez r and konstantinidis 2014 nd estimations of the inoculum and control samples were similar and day 0 values closely followed that of their respective sources a decrease in nd occurred within the first 24 h for all three biological replicates lower diversities were observed in day 1 samples compared to those for the inoculum day 0 samples and the control the sewershed b series increased in diversity for the remaining days while both sewersheds a and c fluctuate thereafter si table s2 observations of beta diversity revealed that the earlier timeseries samples day 0 and day 1 remained quite similar to the inoculum by day 4 considerable shifts in community composition were observed driving the sewage contaminated waters closer to the control si fig s2 k mer mapping to characterize these community wide shifts using kraken2 at the class level showed the depletion of bacteroidia epsilonproteobacteria and clostridia following inoculation none of these classes were detectable in the control samples an increase of gammaproteobacteria abundance occurred within the first 24 h across all replicates after which this class gradually decreased in abundance with time additionally increases in alphaproteobacteria and cytophagia occurred in later time points day 4 and day 7 far beyond levels observed in the control suggesting that the later timepoint samples had not yet fully recovered from perturbation class level relative metagenome based abundances qpcr culture and cell density estimation results are summarized on fig 1 3 4 sewage associated population genome binning and taxonomic identification seven hundred twenty mags were recovered from inoculum and timeseries sample assemblies the 720 mags were dereplicated at the ani 95 level and the highest quality mag per resulting ani group was selected generating a single representative mag for 49 sequence discrete populations hereafter simply populations competitive read mapping to the representative mag of these populations revealed two groupings delineated by their presence or absence in the inoculum of the total 49 33 populations were detected within sewage inoculum samples with varying degrees of prevalence across replicates we selected a subset of 15 of these 33 populations that were above the quantification threshold in each inoculum sample which we refer to as sewage associated populations this selection process was motivated twofold first to focus only on core populations shared between the inoculum recovered from each sewershed examined herein second as an effort to exclude potentially noisy nonspecific or transient populations from further analysis the sewage associated populations and their representative mags are summarized in table 1 additionally we validated our analytical detection and quantification limits using mock data of known composition to ensure these criteria were suitable for identifying sewage associated populations si table s3 a sczyrba et al 2017 we found our approach as described in materials and methods eqs 1 and 2 robust for reducing quantification error and detected targets as expected according to sequencing effort and target genome size except on very limited occasions when close relatives were present in the sample at relative abundances many times greater than the target si table s3b c our collection of ubiquitous sewage associated populations in sewersheds a b and c represented respectively 9 5 5 7 and 13 3 of the total reads in inoculum metagenomes and 15 9 8 8 and 19 6 of geq genome equivalents estimated absolute abundances of these populations varied across the samples from a maximum of 4 4e 07 cells ml pop 01 sewershed b to a minimum of 2 3e 05 cells ml pop 04 sewershed c within the inoculum the median and mean absolute abundances of an individual sewage associated population was 5 3e 06 and 8 4e 06 cells ml respectively overall sewershed c had substantially lower population densities due to the difference in total microbial load compared to sewersheds a and b as noted above consistently the sewage associated populations presented here capture a larger portion of the metagenomic samples associated with sewershed c compared to a or b further indicating that the sewershed c samples may have simply had more dilute microbial load at the time of sampling overall these results reveal that this collection of populations consistently represent highly abundant members of the sewage microbiome across these biological replicates and possibly a substantial part of the total sewage microbial community comparison of the corresponding representative mag sequences against type material in the miga typemat database rodriguez r et al 2018a revealed several entries with close matches to previously described taxa at the species level e g 95 ani including aeromonas caviae pop 15 acidovorax temperans pop 30 prevotella copri pop 43 bacteroides vulgatus pop 44 and rivicola pingtungensis pop 49 of the remaining six populations matched known genus level representatives potentially representing a novel species of the matching genera two populations matched members of a known family one to members of a known order and one to members of a known class table 1 the population with the most distant match in the database pop 13 matching class bacteroidia with 55 1 average amino acid identity aai to paludibacter propioncigenes collections of bacterial isolate genomes and or mags from freshwater rodriguez r et al 2020 activated sludge ye et al 2020 anaerobic digestors campanaro et al 2020 the human gut environments almeida et al 2021 and the broad general purpose gems catalog nayfach et al 2021 were examined to assess specificity between these 15 sewage associated populations and other microbiomes of these sewage associated populations some n 11 may belong to species with members also inhabiting non sewage microbiomes such as biological wastewater treatment processes or the human gut si table s4 importantly only a single population moraxella pop 29 was found via these database searches to match 95 1 95 0 ani borderline of universal species cutoff genomes recovered from aquatic environments both marine and freshwater rodriguez r et al 2018b this finding suggests population 29 could be less effective as an entry in a sewage specific genomic library utilized for mst approaches if other moraxella are in high abundance within unperturbed environments 3 5 sewage associated population decay and putative phenotyping overall all populations experienced rapid decline in estimated cell densities across the timeseries with most populations below detection limits following day 4 acinetobacter sp cloacibacterium sp acidovorax temperans and flavobacterium sp pop 03 pop 18 pop 30 and pop 33 respectively were detectable in at least one biological replicate at day 7 but most of these observations were below quantification signal from sewershed a had the greatest persistence of the four mesocosms with quantifiable levels of a sewage associated population by day 7 three belonged to the series of sewershed a notably acidovorax temperans pop 30 was the only population detected at day 7 in all three sewersheds fig 2 all populations remaining detectable at day 7 were putatively phenotyped as aerobic or facultatively anaerobic by traitar analysis except for cloacibacterium sp pop 18 which could not be confidently classified nonetheless cloacibacterium sp belongs to a genus of facultative anaerobes cloacibacterium suggesting that it likely is a facultative population and that the representative mag did not contain the necessary genes for confident phenotyping due to incompleteness no population regardless of predicted preference for oxygen showed an increased estimated cell density outside the first 24 h of the incubation all sewage associated populations were likely gram negative rod or oval shaped bacteria as predicted by traitar si fig s4 3 6 human markers and sewage associated populations our results suggested that several of the sewage associated populations are possibly linked to the human gut microbiome si table s4 based on whole genome comparisons via ani pop 43 and pop 44 were assigned to bacteroidales lineages that likely represent different clades than those represented by hf183 this was concluded based on either analysis of the 16s rrna genes carried by these populations representative mag hf183 is a 16s rrna gene based marker or if a 16s rrna gene was not binned with the mag the 16s rrna genes carried on the closest matching cultured relative showing at least 95 ani to the representative mag see table 1 in either case hf183 was not a match for pop 43 or pop 44 which is consistent with the notion that hf183 typically belongs to b dorei phocaeicola dorei and its closest relatives modeling the linear relationship between either hf183 or enterococcus concentrations against the estimated cell densities of the sewage associated populations revealed divergent results for both markers specifically hf183 had excellent correlations against some populations i e anaerobic pop 43 and pop 44 and aerobic pop 30 and pop 28 but highly variable correlations overall r2 between 0 35 to 0 97 while enterococcus had worse correlations but with a tighter range r2 between 0 5 to 0 8 fig 3 as noted above not all the sewage associated populations highlighted as potentially co habiting the human gut co varied in abundance as well with hf183 concentrations for example correlations with hf183 concentrations were moderate with the presumed aerobes of pop 03 r2 0 69 and pop 29 r2 0 75 but poor for the facultative anaerobic pop 15 r2 0 35 3 7 source attribution and apportioning assessment source specific genomic libraries were collected and curated as described above and in the supporting information these libraries contain genomes representing populations which are likely restricted to a particular contamination source short reads from the metagenomes collected across the incubation were mapped to these source specific libraries via magic blast and normalized to both genome length and geq as described above the results of this exercise provide an estimation for the percentage of prokaryotic cells likely originating from a particular contamination source fig 4 a no source category was detected in the control sample further human and sewage signals dominated the timeseries across each sewershed though these signals showed rapid decline following day 4 the pig cow and chicken source categories were either not detected or were consistently 0 1 geq 3 8 pathogen and virulence genes assessment to assess the ability of the metagenomic approach to provide insights into the health risk associated with bacterial pathogens introduced by sewage contamination during mesocosm operation we recruited metagenomic short reads to 1076 pathogenic bacterial genomes recovered from the patric webserver supplement table s5 results revealed that 63 38 and 129 pathogen genomes from sewersheds a b and c respectively within the inoculum had sequencing depths at or above our established lod after read mapping supplement table s6 in contrast immediately following inoculation on day 0 many reference genomes were no longer detectable with a total of 61 25 and 20 pathogenic genomes detected from sewersheds a b and c respectively obviously for many of these organisms pathogenicity is a function of exact genotype e g the e coli pathotypes and the methods used herein were developed for species level detection and not optimized for distinguishing between closely related genotypes of the same species at low abundances castro et al 2018 therefore due to the low relative abundances of these pathogens that we observed and the need to assess the actual genetic content present within these populations we examined the relative abundance of experimentally verified genes within the bacterial virulence factor database vfdb as proxies for key bacterial pathogens fig 4b the virulence signal within inoculum metagenomes primarily comprised those belonging to aeromonas klebsiella and shigella pathogenic genera consistent with the whole genome detection results above sewage from both sewershed a and c appeared to have greater virulence factor signals compared to sewage from sewershed b which had drastically lower detected levels of aeromonas vfs virulence factors and no detection of klebsiella shigella or escherichia vfs within the sewershed a and c timeseries average virulence abundance was lower on day 0 than in the inoculum but quickly reached a maximum in 24 h before substantially decreasing by day 4 and being below detection by day 7 the change was primarily due to a substantial increase in the abundance of aeromonas hydrophila vfs this trend was consistent among genes hlya hemolysin aera aerolysin and act aeromonas enterotoxin essential cytotoxins for aeromonas spp pathogenicity across the timeseries alignment of these three cytotoxin genes to the mag representing pop 15 revealed that it likely carries a gene encoding for hlya but aera and act were either not binned with the draft genome or truly not carried by this population upon further inquiry the closest matching entry on ncbi s genome database was aeromonas caviae nz ap022214 ani 98 0 which represents a strain isolated from a japanese wastewater treatment plant that has not been implicated in disease or designated as an obligate pathogen hence to what extent the mag identified represents a pathogenic or opportunistic pathogenic population remains somewhat speculative 3 9 β lactam resistance gene assessment several classes representing the breadth of β lactamase encoding gene diversity were present in the metagenomes from all samples the uninoculated lake water control sample showed very low abundance of β lactamase encoding genes across each class sum of classes was 0 078 total β lactamase encoding genes genome equivalent though a subset of metallo β lactamase encoding genes mbls3 was noticeably pronounced 0 06 gene copies genome equivalent in the inoculum samples total observed β lactamase signal was much greater in sewersheds a and c 1 07 and 1 14 total gene copies genome equivalent respectively compared to sewershed b 0 51 total β lactamase encoding genes genome equivalent but the relative contribution of each class was consistent with genes encoding for blaa blac and oxa dominating in contrast by day 4 and to a greater extent by day 7 the frequency of genes encoding for blaa blac and oxa decreased consistently while those encoding for mbls increased fig 4c along with a shift in prominence of these β lactamase gene classes both sewersheds a and c showed steep decreases in the relative number of β lactamase encoding genes genome equivalent between day 0 and day 7 sewershed c showed the same shifts in prominence between classes yet total signal remained consistent with 0 55 and 0 54 total β lactamase gene copies genome equivalent on day 0 and 7 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 sewershed microbial diversity collection systems represent a key component of modern sanitation infrastructure despite the importance of sewage as a reservoir for human pathogens antimicrobial resistance genes and the recent widespread utilization of wastewater based epidemiology the sewage microbiome remains relatively understudied at the whole genome level our results indicated that the sewage samples we collected from three separate collection systems were dominated by what have been aptly named microbial weeds in literature and which we have observed as belonging to several sewage associated populations that appear quite prolific assress et al 2019 newton et al 2015 fig 1a others have reported that several of these populations are also present at high relative abundances within sewersheds spanning another urban landscape vandewalle et al 2012 these sewage associated populations showed different preference for oxygen appearing to span strict anaerobic facultative and aerobic metabolic phenotypes notably the signal associated with these populations in the metagenomic datasets decayed non uniformly during mesocosm operation though the most persistent populations were aerotolerant acetate utilizing populations which contained genes related to aromatic degradation and or nitrogen metabolism depending on additional inquiry it may be possible to leverage the ratio between abundances of anaerobic and aerobic or facultatively anaerobic sewage associated populations in future work for inferring the date of pollution events linked to sewage contamination for all 15 populations described here their linear relationship with hf183 and enterococci had a combined r2 of 0 6 fig 2 revealing overall consistent results for different markers under the conditions tested here however these correlations were drawn from the limited number of mesocosm incubations and in situ population dynamics are likely to differ according to varying environmental and biological factors which were not controlled for herein ahmed et al 2019 4 2 source attribution and apportioning with source specific genomic libraries populations specific to municipal sewage likely exist and represent a subset of the microbiome of collection systems which if better catalogued may be useful for identifying and quantifying sewage pollution in natural ecosystems si fig s6 we demonstrated through a proof of concept workflow the capacity for read mapping of metagenomic datasets to curated source specific genomic libraries to perform simultaneous source attribution and apportioning this approach yields a relatively easy to interpret metric representing the approximate percentage of prokaryotic cells within a sample that belong to a contamination source fig 4a importantly our approach represents a novel development given that current approaches utilizing sequence data for mst problems are not designed to distinguish between multiple fecal sources mcghee et al 2020 or cannot directly assess source apportioning between multiple sources roguet et al 2020 4 3 β lactamase encoding genes surveillance additionally we leveraged our metagenomes to survey for β lactamase encoding genes across the inoculum and timeseries the abundance of β lactamases across the inoculum samples was substantially higher 7 15 times compared to the control fig 4 c this result was consistent with the literature regarding heightened arg abundance within collection systems li et al 2021 specifically others have reported substantial abundances of β lactamase oxa genes on both campylobacteraceae and aeromonadaceae clades in sewage hultman et al 2018 indeed the abundance of reads belonging to β lactamase encoding genes especially of the oxa encoding class were the most abundant in the inoculum and early time points where these sewage associated clades e g pop 01 pop 19 persisted in the lake water overall these results indicated that sewage contamination imparted a substantial and lasting increase to the abundance of genes encoding β lactamases even after 7 days following the contamination event fig 4c more work is needed to elucidate the genomic context of this increased β lactamase encoding gene abundance e g whether they belong to or have been transferred to organisms capable of driving clinically relevant cases of antimicrobial resistance nonetheless our results allow for a quantitative view of the abundance of these genes relative to the natural environment which could be quite relevant for assessing associated health risks as part of future work 4 4 shotgun sequencing and monitoring environmental waters importantly although sewershed a and b showed what appears to be similar concentrations of human input according to hf183 concentrations within the inoculum si fig s1 the pathogen detection results revealed via the sequence data were quite varied fig 4b si table s6 results from both read mapping to bacterial pathogen genomes and the experimentally verified vfdb collection were consistent in suggesting that bacterial virulence may have been more elevated in the sewershed a inoculum compared to sewershed b this contrast between sewersheds with equal human marker concentrations yet apparently unequal bacterial pathogen load illustrates how shotgun sequence data can facilitate perspectives on the actual co variance of marker and pathogen yet these insights clearly depend on sufficient sequencing effort and or relatively high pathogen concentrations to avoid the possibility of false negative results in particular the estimated smallest detectable population size associated with our analysis and sequencing effort ranged between approximately 2e 05 to 1e 02 cells ml based on qpcr based cell count normalization and the sequencing effort applied materials and methods si table s2 approaches for estimating analytical lod within metagenomic based analysis remain rare within the literature especially as it relates to work done in the environment as opposed to clinical settings wendl et al 2013 ebinger et al 2021 yet the concept of detection and quantification limits in metagenomics is a major challenge to its thorough incorporation into environmental monitoring approaches because 1 it is necessary to track biomarkers or pathogens down to quite low relative abundance in the field e g at frequencies 1e 09 target basepairs total basepairs and 2 leveraging extraordinary sequencing effort is currently expensive and not practical when limitations of expertise and computational resources exist our approach provides the means to establish theoretical analytical lod for metagenomic analyses based on sequencing effort which is useful for determining and interpreting the meaning of non detects additionally using average genome size ags and total cell density estimates within the inoculum we estimate that approximately 3 5tbp of sequencing effort is necessary for detecting a population with concentration of 1e 02 cells ml within the high microbial loading conditions such as those observed in the inoculum sewage in contrast following the decline in cell density and increase in ags across the timeseries the estimated sequencing effort required to detect a population of 1e 02 cells ml drops to 10gbp in day 7 conditions which had far smaller microbial loads therefore our approach and results reported here for sequencing effort estimation may be helpful for informing the planning and execution of future environmental monitoring work utilizing metagenomic approaches si table s7 though crucial to note is the fact that our approaches for analytical lod and sequencing effort estimation assumes unbiased sequencing and does not consider sampling or processing recoveries where the latter limitation is obviously broadly applicable to all molecular methods total detection limits in the context of analytical limits as well as both sequencing bias and sampling processing recoveries will be important caveats to consider for future metagenomic workflows aiming to surveil pathogens in sewage collection systems and their releases into the natural and built environment hull et al 2019 our efforts have shown how metagenomic datasets can provide insights on multiple questions critical to environmental monitoring and water quality pathogen detection source attribution and apportioning and arg persistence in the environment in our view confident and direct detection of pathogens within metagenomic datasets will remain primarily a logistical challenge due to the large amount of sequencing effort required to reliably detect bacterial pathogens at concentrations that are very low yet still quite relevant for safeguarding public health for example we have shown how via metagenomics one could track a broad range of population sizes about five orders of magnitude from about 1e 01 to 1e 02 cells ml but that reliable detection depends on both sequencing effort and microbial load thus when performed alone metagenomic approaches are unlikely to be the most prudent technology for routine monitoring and directly informing health risks associated with sewage contamination especially when pathogen or virulence genes are at these relatively low abundances e g below 1e 02 features ml this issue is also compounded by the large contribution of non bacterial pathogens e g viruses and protozoa to illness risk in contaminated waters in contrast metagenomic approaches are increasingly poised to resolve questions related to source attribution and apportioning by improving our understanding and the size of public databases of the genomes maintained by source specific microbial populations 4 5 limitations our dataset is of limited size and scope considering that on a global scale we examined sewage from collection systems in essentially equivalent geographies the assortment of sewage associated populations described here although ubiquitous across the sewersheds we sampled likely maintain differing prevalence across time or space furthermore many draft genomes we produced are not complete so further work will be needed to establish more practical views on both the geographic range of these populations and their genomic content and diversity yet we see advancing our knowledge of sewage associated populations as a potential contribution towards newly developing forensic approaches that help monitor manage and repair essential infrastructure gonzalez et al 2020 for example we observed several highly abundant populations with a range restricted to only one or two of the three sewersheds going forward it will be important to gage whether populations or genotypes within a population exist that are specific to individual sewersheds further inquiry in this direction may also lead to strategies for resolving source attribution problems when multiple collection systems with differing catchment compositions are all possible sources of contamination in the same water environment our reporting for source apportioning fig 4a reports geq belonging to each genome library this metric represents an estimation of the fraction of prokaryote cells which we are confident belong to a particular source library yet the values reported herein should not be interpreted as representing the fraction of total fecal material belonging to a particular source additionally some signal is reported as belonging to off target libraries e g chicken despite our efforts to eliminate cross reactive genomic entries based on ani comparisons a priori we believe this signal likely belongs to genomes of populations with close relatives within either the background matrix e g freshwater or sewage microbial communities which have yet to be cataloged thus as more genomic datasets from these environments becomes available it will be important to update these source specific libraries to ensure better performance and less cross reactivity 5 conclusions we tracked the microbial dynamics of a simulated sewage spill in freshwater mesocosms for 7 days using shotgun metagenomes culture and qpcr to better establish how shotgun metagenomics can assist with water quality monitoring efforts metagenomic analysis revealed that genes related to bacterial virulence and antimicrobial resistance were substantially enriched by the addition of sewage compared to the pristine control but became markedly depleted by the 4th day genome reconstruction and comparison to available public databases suggest that collection systems likely harbor their own specific microbial populations which are largely distinct from those in other environments including the human gut genomes from publicly available datasets including those recovered by this study were compiled and analyzed to provide a set of source specific and non redundant genomic libraries a reproducible bioinformatic workflow was developed harnessing a well defined limit of detection and the source specific genome libraries developed herein to perform source attribution and apportioning of fecal signal in metagenomic datasets recovered from the water environment direct detection of pathogenic bacteria remains challenging due to the large amount of

16369,little is known about the genomic diversity of the microbial communities associated with raw municipal wastewater sewage including whether microbial populations specific to sewage exist and how such populations could be used to improve source attribution and apportioning in contaminated waters herein we used the influent of three wastewater treatment plants in atlanta georgia usa to perturb laboratory freshwater mesocosms simulating sewage contamination events and followed these mesocosms with shotgun metagenomics over a 7 day observational period we describe 15 abundant non redundant bacterial metagenome assembled genomes mags ubiquitous within all sewage inocula yet absent from the unperturbed freshwater control at our analytical limit of detection tracking the dynamics of the populations represented by these mags revealed varied decay kinetics depending on inferred phenotypes e g anaerobes decayed faster than aerobes under the well aerated incubation conditions notably a portion of these populations showed decay patterns similar to those of common markers enterococcus and hf183 despite the apparent decay of these populations the abundance of β lactamase encoding genes remained high throughout incubation relative to the control lastly we constructed genomic libraries representing several different fecal sources and outline a bioinformatic approach which leverages

tracking metagenomics sewage collection systems wastewater microbial ecology water quality 1 introduction wastewater collection systems or simply collection systems represent an important engineering control for the collection of human feces commercial or industrial wastewaters and sometimes stormwater particularly in certain urban settings the operation and maintenance of collection systems pose

contamination among multiple probable fecal sources including sewage harwood et al 2014 in large part the technical approaches behind mst methods have been developed in response to both the difficulty of assaying for the diverse array of relevant human pathogens as well as the practical need to keep methods relatively rapid and inexpensive existing approaches have relied on indicator organisms to imply the presence of fecal pollution and sometimes as proxies for the presence of human pathogens in contaminated waters specifically fecal indicator bacteria fib include an aggregation of bacterial populations considered representatives of microbial communities inhabiting the guts of warm blooded animals widely used indicator organisms include escherichia coli and enterococcus spp more recently mst genetic markers from distinct bacterial lineages have been used that leverage known host specificity of distinct populations for source attribution bernhard et al 2000 some markers e g the hf183 primer targeting a human associated bacteroides clade have found effective use in environmental management strategies as the basis for inferring the amount of sewage present and thereby a potential array of pathogen concentrations for iterative risk assessment simulations boehm et al 2015 yet the use of fib and mst gene markers has had challenges most notably that the concentration of most markers are rarely found to co vary with pathogen concentrations marker concentrations fluctuate with sewage age and the capability of fib to adapt to environmental conditions can all combine to confound results interpretation harwood et al 2014 korajkic et al 2018 ahmed et al 2016 2019 devane et al 2020 in recent years targeted metabarcoding methods have examined sewage and sewage contaminated waters via the 16s rrna gene or the internal transcribed spacer its for prokaryotes and fungi respectively ahmed et al 2016 unno et al 2018 mclellan and eren 2014 assress et al 2019 these studies have revealed a distinct sewage microbiome dominated by taxa that proliferate in collection systems sometimes far beyond the abundance of human gut associated populations newton et al 2015 mclellan and roguet 2019 mclellan et al 2010 however these single gene assays offer limited resolution to distinguish between environmental or non environmental strains of the same species due to conservation of the rrna gene or the its region likewise these methods do not provide information about the gene content associated with important populations e g emergent pathogens args present or resolve finer community wide compositional shifts ahmed et al 2016 poretsky et al 2014 therefore rrna gene based approaches are limited with respect to quantifying health risks associated with the detection of biomarkers or guide the development of more holistic environmental management criteria e g site specific criteria whole genome shotgun sequencing or metagenomics which recovers fragments of the genomes in a sample have revealed that bacteria and archaea predominantly form sequence discrete populations with intra population genomic sequence relatedness typically ranging from approximately 95 to 100 average nucleotide identity ani depending on the population considered a level that the 16s rrna gene cannot often assess caro quintero and konstantinidis 2012 rodriguez r et

of relative abundance at the species level and 3 examination of intra species diversity segata 2018 despite its potential for circumventing some of the challenges facing existing mst and metabarcoding methods whole genome shotgun sequencing has not been utilized in monitoring municipal sewage pollution to date metagenomic applications have focused on understanding the microbiology of biological wastewater treatment treated effluents and their receiving waters or viral populations lira et al 2020 cai and zhang 2013 bibby and peccia 2013 in part this is because it remains unclear how to best merge the methods and bioinformatics behind metagenomic practices with existing mst and environmental monitoring paradigms hong et al 2020 widespread application of this technology in the field requires that several outstanding issues be resolved including the detection limits of metagenomic analyses whether whole and or metagenome assembled genomes mags can serve as source specific fecal contamination markers and how metagenomic approaches can infer the relative contribution of various fecal inputs referred to hereafter as source apportioning here we offer a metagenomic perspective on sewage related bacterial populations and explore their relationships with culture and pcr based markers during a simulated failure of a collection system i e spill specifically we simulated sewage contamination events in lake water obtained from a local drinking water and recreational use reservoir within dialysis bag laboratory mesocosms that were incubated in the dark for one week shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed to search for potential sewage specific biomarkers test the effectiveness of genome collections for fecal source attribution and apportioning and directly screen for both pathogens and antimicrobial resistance genes we further support these aims by developing and testing a theoretical analytical limit of detection which can help guide the future application and interpretation of metagenomics to these issues 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and mesocosm operation samples were collected in sterile glass 1 l bottles from the primary influent of three wwtps located in the atlanta metropolitan region of georgia usa to serve as representatives of sewage across three different sewersheds each sewershed was comprised of collection systems with separate stormwater and wastewater conveyance i e separate sewers approximately 50 l of surface water from lake lanier georgia was also collected concurrently hereafter these sample groups are referred to as sewersheds a b and c all sewage and water samples were immediately transported to the lab and stored in darkness at 4 c until mesocosm setup which occurred within 24 h for mesocosm setup 40 l tanks were filled with lake water and a pump installed for aeration experimental dialysis bags were prepared with 110 ml 10 v v sewage and lake water mixture and control bags were filled with 110 ml uninoculated lake water and closed on both ends using polypropylene spectra por clamps spectrum laboratories both experimental n 12 3 sewersheds 36 bags and control n 12 bags dialysis bags were then added to the tank a small headspace of air was left in each bag when sealing with clamps so that they could float freely in the tank dialysis bag pore sizes 6 8 kda molecular weight cutoff permit the transport of small molecules and ions but bacterial and viral particles are contained within the bags mesocosms were kept in darkness at 22 c throughout the duration of the experiment sampling occurred at 1 4 and 7 days by retrieving experimental and control bags from the mesocosm for destructive processing 2 2 culturing dna purification qpcr and shotgun sequencing epa method 1600 usepa 2009 was followed for enumerating volumetric enterococcus cfus three replicates of each sample were diluted 10 fold and then plated in duplicate all dilutions yielding measurements within an acceptable range for counting were averaged to estimate cfus 100 ml for a sample mesocosm sampling dna extraction and subsequent qpcr analysis occurred as described previously in suttner et al suttner et al 2021 briefly water samples were passed through 0 45 μm pore size polycarbonate pc membranes and stored at 80 c in 2 ml screw cap bead tubes until processed within 1 3 months dna was extracted from pc membranes using the qiagen powerfecal kit following the manufacturer s instructions with only one exception mechanical cell lysis was performed by bead beating in two 1 minute intervals using the biospec mini beadbeater 24 with icing between intervals these dna extractions were used as template for qpcr with the hf183 bfdrev assay wade et al 2010 and a universal 16s rrna gene qpcr assay genbac16s to quantify 16s rrna gene copies across samples ritalahti et al 2006 metagenomic sequencing was performed using the illumina nextera xt kit with library average insert size determined on an agilent 2100 instrument using a hs dna kit and library concentrations determined using the qubit 1x dsdna assay samples were then pooled and sequenced on the hiseq 2500 instrument as described previously johnston et al 2019 all qpcr reactions were run using an applied biosystems 7500 fast thermocycler and the cycling parameters were as follows 2 min at 50 c 10 min at 95 c and 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 c and 60 s at 60 c assay reactions used 2 μl of template dna in 20 μl qpcr reactions with the taqman universal pcr master mix applied biosystems the primer and probe concentrations were 0 25 μm for hf183 assay and 0 3 μm for the bac16s assay template dnas were run diluted 5 fold to remove the effect of pcr inhibitors based on the expected marker concentration and quality of each sample further details on qpcr reaction set up and standard plasmids for absolute quantification are provided in suttner et al 2021 and reiterated within supporting information si table s1 to test for extraneous dna and potential contamination from sample handling 50 ml of sterile pbs was also filtered onto pc membranes and processed following the same dna extraction at every sampling time point as described above 2 3 sequence data analysis short reads were quality trimmed and nextera adapters removed with trimmomatic 0 39 bolger et al 2014 quality trimming was performed to remove poor quality bases along both ends of sequences and subsequent removal of any sequences below 50 bp in length k mer based operation of nonpareil 3 304 t kmer was used to estimate the fraction of alpha diversity covered by the sequencing effort of each metagenome rodriguez r et al 2018 beta diversity across trimmed short reads was assessed with the default settings of simka 1 5 1 based on bray curtis dissimilarity values and visualized by principal coordinate analysis pcoa benoit et al 2016 kraken2 was used to assign taxonomy and estimate simple relative abundance against a custom library including bacteria archaea viruses protozoa human and fungal reference genomes at the rank of class wood et al 2019 trimmed short reads were assembled individually with idba ud 1 1 3 and spades meta 3 14 0 using k mer sizes between 20 and 127 peng et al 2012 prjibelski et al 2020 contigs shorter than 3 kbp were removed prior to population genome binning which was performed with maxbin 2 2 7 and metabat 2 12 1 wu et al 2016 kang et al 2019 additionally in a parallel workflow trimmed short reads were normalized via the bbnorm function of the bbtools suite version 38 to bring depths between 10 and 30x sequencing depth and then subsequently assembled and binned as described above bushnell 2014 all resulting metagenome assembled genomes mags from both regular and depth normalized short read assemblies were dereplicated using miga 0 7 24 0 via the derep wf function rodriguez r et al 2018 groups of mags sharing ani 95 were clustered into species like populations hereafter populations with representative mags for each population selected by highest completeness and lowest redundancy populations with no representative mag having a miga quality score above 30 and or redundancies below 5 were excluded from further analysis both traitar 1 1 2 and microbeannotator were used with default settings to infer potential phenotypes and annotate draft genomes respectively weimann et al 2016 ruiz perez et al 2021 lastly mags were screened for cross reactivity using the fastani tool to search for other genomes with ani 95 across a suite of reference databases jain et al 2018 from the patric database version 3 6 9 1097 pathogenic bacterial genome accession ids were recovered by querying for host name human homo sapiens and good quality this included both genomes tagged as reference n 28 and representative n 1069 davis et al 2020 of these 1076 genomes were recoverable from ncbi for use in this study abundance estimates of pathogen genomes were assessed by competitive short read mapping with magic blast 1 4 0 splice f boratyn et al 2019 resulting alignments were filtered using minimum cut off of 70 bp alignment length 95 query coverage by alignment and 95 identity to avoid spurious matches additionally for virulence gene detection only experimentally verified nucleotide entries in the virulence factor database liu et al 2019 were used evaluating mag relative abundance across the time series was accomplished similarly using magic blast 1 4 0 where mags were concatenated into a single library to which reads were competitively mapped additionally diamond 2 0 1 blastx ultra sensitive was used to search short reads against the reference gene sequences of pre compiled 150 bp β lactamase rocker models to reliably identify short reads belonging to β lactamase encoding genes buchfink et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 reads mapping to these reference sequences were selected for best bit score alignment and subsequently filtered by rocker v1 5 2 as described previously orellana et al 2017 2 4 detection and quantification of metagenomic features for a reference genome mag or gene to be considered detected in a sample at least 10 of the target sequence was required to be covered by reads i e breadth of coverage hereafter c as proposed previously for robust detection of targets in metagenomic datasets castro et al 2018 or as written the analytical limit of detection lod used here 1 a n a l y t i c a l l o d c 0 1 the lod was automatically implemented by calculating sequencing depth and breadth similarly to rodriguez r et al 2020 for estimating truncated average depth at 80 hereafter the function tad80 python scripts used for this approach are available online at https github com rotheconrad 00 in situ genecoverage in short the tad80 function estimates sequencing depth by first sorting genomic positions according to their sequencing depth and then removing the upper 10 and lower 10 of positions before averaging the sequencing depth along the remaining 80 of positions since truncation of targets with breadth of coverage near the detection limits e g c 0 1 could introduce artificially lower values a quantification threshold was also necessary to avoid systemic underestimation of abundance for targets near lod from lander and waterman 1988 breadth of coverage c is related to sequencing depth ρ by the following 2 c 1 e ρ thus for the analytical lod defined above the expected sequencing depth ρ is simply ln 0 9 for targets at detectable limits we formalize a quantification threshold which measures whether a target is quantifiable following application of the truncation function tad80 with 3 q u a n t i f i c a t i o n t h r e s h o l d t a d 80 ρ ln 0 9 for simplicity in our metagenomic results we describe those targets which satisfied the lod condition but were below the quantification threshold as targets that were detected but not quantifiable dnq to convert relative abundance of detected target genomes to absolute abundances e g cells ml the following approach was used single copy gene coverage or genome equivalents geq and average genome size ags of metagenomes were evaluated using microbecensus 1 1 0 nayfach and pollard 2015 the 16s rrna gene carrying reads were identified and extracted using sortmerna 4 2 0 and the average 16s rrna gene coverage was estimated as the sum of extracted read lengths divided by 1540 bp the average length of the bacterial 16s rrna gene kopylova et al 2012 wang et al 2007 average 16s rrna gene copy number 16s acn for each metagenome was determined by the ratio between 16s rrna sequencing depth ρ 16s and geq 4 16 s r r n a a c n ρ 16 s g e q the copy number of the 16s rrna gene per ml as quantified by qpcr was divided by the 16s rrna acn to obtain an estimate for the number of cells in each sample assuming that one prokaryotic genome was approximately equivalent to one prokaryotic cell 5 e s t i m a t e d p r o k a r y o t i c c e l l d e n s i t y c e l l s m l 16 s r r n a c o p i e s m l 16 s r r n a a c n these measures were taken to help control for bias in relative abundance estimation due to changes in overall microbial load cells per volume and 16s rrna gene acn variation throughout the experiment lin and peddada 2020 morton et al 2019 finally absolute abundances were estimated by multiplying a population s genome equivalents by the estimate for the number of cells in a sample this was accomplished using the following equation for a given population via the truncated average sequencing depth tad80 ρ geq and total estimated prokaryotic cell density 6 e s t p o p c e l l d e n s i t y c e l l s m l t a d 80 ρ g e q e s t p r o k c e l l d e n s i t y c e l l s m l further an extension of our definitions of lod was used in

o k c e l l d e n s i t y c e l l s m l 2 5 curation of source specific genome collections it was necessary to curate a collection of source specific genomes in order to support our efforts to develop metagenomic based source attribution and apportioning approaches in short we collected reference genomes mags and isolate genomes from several large scale studies of host microbiomes these datasets included genomes gathered from the fecal microbiomes of humans n 4644 genomes pigs n 1667 genomes and chickens n 5675 and the rumen microbiome of cows n 2124 genomes almeida et al 2021 stewart et al 2019 gilroy et al 2021 chen et al 2021 mags produced in this study were also included as representatives of sewage sources detailed methods for the curation and dereplication of these collections are summarized in supporting information and visualized in si fig 6s lastly these libraries are hosted online for public use and download at http enve omics ce gatech edu data mst library 2 6 data availability sewage and mesocosm short reads as well as sewage associated mags can be accessed through ncbi within bioproject prjna691978 3 results 3 1 culture and qpcr data both fecal indicators enterococcus and hf183 were in the same order of magnitude across the sewage samples gathered as inoculum for the mesocosms sewage from sewersheds a and b contained counts with averages of 3 7e 04 and 3 1e 04 enterococci cfus 100 ml and 2 4e 06 and 3 6e 06 hf183 copies ml respectively within sewershed c counts were lower having 1 3e 04 enterococci cfus 100 ml and 1 5e 06 hf183 copies ml similarly quantification of the 16s rrna gene copy number within the inoculum indicated that overall microbial loads were lower in sewershed c than sewersheds a and b at the time of sampling si fig s1 monitoring enterococci and hf183 qpcr markers across the mesocosm timeseries revealed that the markers decreased throughout the experiment in all replicates but were still detectable at day 7 and remained higher than the established or recommended water quality criteria for recreational use waters i e 36 cfus 100 ml and 41 hf183 copies ml usepa 2015 boehm et al 2018 only the hf183 marker within sewershed c mesocosm decreased below detection on day 7 fig 1 neither marker was detected in the un inoculated freshwater serving as control at any time point during mesocosm operation 3 2 estimated microbial load the estimated prokaryotic cell density of the inoculum varied based on quantification of the 16s rrna gene 1 1e 09 2 0e 09 and 1 8e 08 cells ml were estimated for sewersheds a b and c respectively following dilution and mixing of the inoculum into the mesocosms day 0 estimates for cell densities were 2 0e 07 1 7e 08 and 2 5e 07 cells ml thereafter cell density in both sewershed a and sewershed c mesocosm increased considerably in the first 24 h to 1 8e 08 and 6 9e 07 estimated cells ml a 924 and 275 increase while sewershed b decreased to 1 5e 08 cells ml subsequent time points revealed steady decreases in cell densities approaching the control cell density at day 7 of 7 9e 05 cells ml si table s2 3 3 metagenomic coverage and compositional shifts between 1 5 gbp to 3 5 gbp of data per sample remained following read quality trimming and adapter removal which corresponded to a range of 9 to 27 million reads sequencing effort covered between 36 and 67 of expected nucleotide diversity nd across all samples based on the nonpareil algorithm which estimates sequence coverage based on the degree of redundancy among the metagenomic reads available for each dataset rodriguez r et al 2018 this level of coverage is adequate for comparing the abundance of features e g genomes genes across samples rodriguez r and konstantinidis 2014 nd estimations of the inoculum and control samples were similar and day 0 values closely followed that of their respective sources a decrease in nd occurred within the first 24 h for all three biological replicates lower diversities were observed in day 1 samples compared to those for the inoculum day 0 samples and the control the sewershed b series increased in diversity for the remaining days while both sewersheds a and c fluctuate thereafter si table s2 observations of beta diversity revealed that the earlier timeseries samples day 0 and day 1 remained quite similar to the inoculum by day 4 considerable shifts in community composition were observed driving the sewage contaminated waters closer to the control si fig s2 k mer mapping to characterize these community wide shifts using kraken2 at the class level showed the depletion of bacteroidia epsilonproteobacteria and clostridia following inoculation none of these classes were detectable in the control samples an increase of gammaproteobacteria abundance occurred within the first 24 h across all replicates after which this class gradually decreased in abundance with time additionally increases in alphaproteobacteria and cytophagia occurred in later time points day 4 and day 7 far beyond levels observed in the control suggesting that the later timepoint samples had not yet fully recovered from perturbation class level relative metagenome based abundances qpcr culture and cell density estimation results are summarized on fig 1 3 4 sewage associated population genome binning and taxonomic identification seven hundred twenty mags were recovered from inoculum and timeseries sample assemblies the 720 mags were dereplicated at the ani 95 level and the highest quality mag per resulting ani group was selected generating a single representative mag for 49 sequence discrete populations hereafter simply populations competitive read mapping to the representative mag of these populations revealed two groupings delineated by their presence or absence in the inoculum of the total 49 33 populations were detected within sewage inoculum samples with varying degrees of prevalence across replicates we selected a subset of 15 of these 33 populations that were above the quantification threshold in each inoculum sample which we refer to as sewage associated populations this selection process was motivated twofold first to focus only on core populations shared between the inoculum recovered from each sewershed examined herein second as an effort to exclude potentially noisy nonspecific or transient populations from further analysis the sewage associated populations and their representative mags are summarized in table 1 additionally we validated our analytical detection and quantification limits using mock data of known composition to ensure these criteria were suitable for identifying sewage associated populations si table s3 a sczyrba et al 2017 we found our approach as described in materials and methods eqs 1 and 2 robust for reducing quantification error and detected targets as expected according to sequencing effort and target genome size except on very limited occasions when close relatives were present in the sample at relative abundances many times greater than the target si table s3b c our collection of ubiquitous sewage associated populations in sewersheds a b and c represented respectively 9 5 5 7 and 13 3 of the total reads in inoculum metagenomes and 15 9 8 8 and 19 6 of geq genome equivalents estimated absolute abundances of these populations varied across the samples from a maximum of 4 4e 07 cells ml pop 01 sewershed b to a minimum of 2 3e 05 cells ml pop 04 sewershed c within the inoculum the median and mean absolute abundances of an individual sewage associated population was 5 3e 06 and 8 4e 06 cells ml respectively overall sewershed c had substantially lower population densities due to the difference in total microbial load compared to sewersheds a and b as noted above consistently the sewage associated populations presented here capture a larger portion of the metagenomic samples associated with sewershed c compared to a or b further indicating that the sewershed c samples may have simply had more dilute microbial load at the time of sampling overall these results reveal that this collection of populations consistently represent highly abundant members of the sewage microbiome across these biological replicates and possibly a substantial part of the total sewage microbial community comparison of the corresponding representative mag sequences against type material in the miga typemat database rodriguez r et al 2018a revealed several entries with close matches to previously described taxa at the species level e g 95 ani including aeromonas caviae pop 15 acidovorax temperans pop 30 prevotella copri pop 43 bacteroides vulgatus pop 44 and rivicola pingtungensis pop 49 of the remaining six populations matched known genus level representatives potentially representing a novel species of the matching genera two populations matched members of a known family one to members of a known order and one to members of a known class table 1 the population with the most distant match in the database pop 13 matching class bacteroidia with 55 1 average amino acid identity aai to paludibacter propioncigenes collections of bacterial isolate genomes and or mags from freshwater rodriguez r et al 2020 activated sludge ye et al 2020 anaerobic digestors campanaro et al 2020 the human gut environments almeida et al 2021 and the broad general purpose gems catalog nayfach et al 2021 were examined to assess specificity between these 15 sewage associated populations and other microbiomes of these sewage associated populations some n 11 may belong to species with members also inhabiting non sewage microbiomes such as biological wastewater treatment processes or the human gut si table s4 importantly only a single population moraxella pop 29 was found via these database searches to match 95 1 95 0 ani borderline of universal species cutoff genomes recovered from aquatic environments both marine and freshwater rodriguez r et al 2018b this finding suggests population 29 could be less effective as an entry in a sewage specific genomic library utilized for mst approaches if other moraxella are in high abundance within unperturbed environments 3 5 sewage associated population decay and putative phenotyping overall all populations experienced rapid decline in estimated cell densities across the timeseries with most populations below detection limits following day 4 acinetobacter sp cloacibacterium sp acidovorax temperans and flavobacterium sp pop 03 pop 18 pop 30 and pop 33 respectively were detectable in at least one biological replicate at day 7 but most of these observations were below quantification signal from sewershed a had the greatest persistence of the four mesocosms with quantifiable levels of a sewage associated population by day 7 three belonged to the series of sewershed a notably acidovorax temperans pop 30 was the only population detected at day 7 in all three sewersheds fig 2 all populations remaining detectable at day 7 were putatively phenotyped as aerobic or facultatively anaerobic by traitar analysis except for cloacibacterium sp pop 18 which could not be confidently classified nonetheless cloacibacterium sp belongs to a genus of facultative anaerobes cloacibacterium suggesting that it likely is a facultative population and that the representative mag did not contain the necessary genes for confident phenotyping due to incompleteness no population regardless of predicted preference for oxygen showed an increased estimated cell density outside the first 24 h of the incubation all sewage associated populations were likely gram negative rod or oval shaped bacteria as predicted by traitar si fig s4 3 6 human markers and sewage associated populations our results suggested that several of the sewage associated populations are possibly linked to the human gut microbiome si table s4 based on whole genome comparisons via ani pop 43 and pop 44 were assigned to bacteroidales lineages that likely represent different clades than those represented by hf183 this was concluded based on either analysis of the 16s rrna genes carried by these populations representative mag hf183 is a 16s rrna gene based marker or if a 16s rrna gene was not binned with the mag the 16s rrna genes carried on the closest matching cultured relative showing at least 95 ani to the representative mag see table 1 in either case hf183 was not a match for pop 43 or pop 44 which is consistent with the notion that hf183 typically belongs to b dorei phocaeicola dorei and its closest relatives modeling the linear relationship between either hf183 or enterococcus concentrations against the estimated cell densities of the sewage associated populations revealed divergent results for both markers specifically hf183 had excellent correlations against some populations i e anaerobic pop 43 and pop 44 and aerobic pop 30 and pop 28 but highly variable correlations overall r2 between 0 35 to 0 97 while enterococcus had worse correlations but with a tighter range r2 between 0 5 to 0 8 fig 3 as noted above not all the sewage associated populations highlighted as potentially co habiting the human gut co varied in abundance as well with hf183 concentrations for example correlations with hf183 concentrations were moderate with the presumed aerobes of pop 03 r2 0 69 and pop 29 r2 0 75 but poor for the facultative anaerobic pop 15 r2 0 35 3 7 source attribution and apportioning assessment source specific genomic libraries were collected and curated as described above and in the supporting information these libraries contain genomes representing populations which are likely restricted to a particular contamination source short reads from the metagenomes collected across the incubation were mapped to these source specific libraries via magic blast and normalized to both genome length and geq as described above the results of this exercise provide an estimation for the percentage of prokaryotic cells likely originating from a particular contamination source fig 4 a no source category was detected in the control sample further human and sewage signals dominated the timeseries across each sewershed though these signals showed rapid decline following day 4 the pig cow and chicken source categories were either not detected or were consistently 0 1 geq 3 8 pathogen and virulence genes assessment to assess the ability of the metagenomic approach to provide insights into the health risk associated with bacterial pathogens introduced by sewage contamination during mesocosm operation we recruited metagenomic short reads to 1076 pathogenic bacterial genomes recovered from the patric webserver supplement table s5 results revealed that 63 38 and 129 pathogen genomes from sewersheds a b and c respectively within the inoculum had sequencing depths at or above our established lod after read mapping supplement table s6 in contrast immediately following inoculation on day 0 many reference genomes were no longer detectable with a total of 61 25 and 20 pathogenic genomes detected from sewersheds a b and c respectively obviously for many of these organisms pathogenicity is a function of exact genotype e g the e coli pathotypes and the methods used herein were developed for species level detection and not optimized for distinguishing between closely related genotypes of the same species at low abundances castro et al 2018 therefore due to the low relative abundances of these pathogens that we observed and the need to assess the actual genetic content present within these populations we examined the relative abundance of experimentally verified genes within the bacterial virulence factor database vfdb as proxies for key bacterial pathogens fig 4b the virulence signal within inoculum metagenomes primarily comprised those belonging to aeromonas klebsiella and shigella pathogenic genera consistent with the whole genome detection results above sewage from both sewershed a and c appeared to have greater virulence factor signals compared to sewage from sewershed b which had drastically lower detected levels of aeromonas vfs virulence factors and no detection of klebsiella shigella or escherichia vfs within the sewershed a and c timeseries average virulence abundance was lower on day 0 than in the inoculum but quickly reached a maximum in 24 h before substantially decreasing by day 4 and being below detection by day 7 the change was primarily due to a substantial increase in the abundance of aeromonas hydrophila vfs this trend was consistent among genes hlya hemolysin aera aerolysin and act aeromonas enterotoxin essential cytotoxins for aeromonas spp pathogenicity across the timeseries alignment of these three cytotoxin genes to the mag representing pop 15 revealed that it likely carries a gene encoding for hlya but aera and act were either not binned with the draft genome or truly not carried by this population upon further inquiry the closest matching entry on ncbi s genome database was aeromonas caviae nz ap022214 ani 98 0 which represents a strain isolated from a japanese wastewater treatment plant that has not been implicated in disease or designated as an obligate pathogen hence to what extent the mag identified represents a pathogenic or opportunistic pathogenic population remains somewhat speculative 3 9 β lactam resistance gene assessment several classes representing the breadth of β lactamase encoding gene diversity were present in the metagenomes from all samples the uninoculated lake water control sample showed very low abundance of β lactamase encoding genes across each class sum of classes was 0 078 total β lactamase encoding genes genome equivalent though a subset of metallo β lactamase encoding genes mbls3 was noticeably pronounced 0 06 gene copies genome equivalent in the inoculum samples total observed β lactamase signal was much greater in sewersheds a and c 1 07 and 1 14 total gene copies genome equivalent respectively compared to sewershed b 0 51 total β lactamase encoding genes genome equivalent but the relative contribution of each class was consistent with genes encoding for blaa blac and oxa dominating in contrast by day 4 and to a greater extent by day 7 the frequency of genes encoding for blaa blac and oxa decreased consistently while those encoding for mbls increased fig 4c along with a shift in prominence of these β lactamase gene classes both sewersheds a and c showed steep decreases in the relative number of β lactamase encoding genes genome equivalent between day 0 and day 7 sewershed c showed the same shifts in prominence between classes yet total signal remained consistent with 0 55 and 0 54 total β lactamase gene copies genome equivalent on day 0 and 7 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 sewershed microbial diversity collection systems represent a key component of modern sanitation infrastructure despite the importance of sewage as a reservoir for human pathogens antimicrobial resistance genes and the recent widespread utilization of wastewater based epidemiology the sewage microbiome remains relatively understudied at the whole genome level our results indicated that the sewage samples we collected from three separate collection systems were dominated by what have been aptly named microbial weeds in literature and which we have observed as belonging to several sewage associated populations that appear quite prolific assress et al 2019 newton et al 2015 fig 1a others have reported that several of these populations are also present at high relative abundances within sewersheds spanning another urban landscape vandewalle et al 2012 these sewage associated populations showed different preference for oxygen appearing to span strict anaerobic facultative and aerobic metabolic phenotypes notably the signal associated with these populations in the metagenomic datasets decayed non uniformly during mesocosm operation though the most persistent populations were aerotolerant acetate utilizing populations which contained genes related to aromatic degradation and or nitrogen metabolism depending on additional inquiry it may be possible to leverage the ratio between abundances of anaerobic and aerobic or facultatively anaerobic sewage associated populations in future work for inferring the date of pollution events linked to sewage contamination for all 15 populations described here their linear relationship with hf183 and enterococci had a combined r2 of 0 6 fig 2 revealing overall consistent results for different markers under the conditions tested here however these correlations were drawn from the limited number of mesocosm incubations and in situ population dynamics are likely to differ according to varying environmental and biological factors which were not controlled for herein ahmed et al 2019 4 2 source attribution and apportioning with source specific genomic libraries populations specific to municipal sewage likely exist and represent a subset of the microbiome of collection systems which if better catalogued may be useful for identifying and quantifying sewage pollution in natural ecosystems si fig s6 we demonstrated through a proof of concept workflow the capacity for read mapping of metagenomic datasets to curated source specific genomic libraries to perform simultaneous source attribution and apportioning this approach yields a relatively easy to interpret metric representing the approximate percentage of prokaryotic cells within a sample that belong to a contamination source fig 4a importantly our approach represents a novel development given that current approaches utilizing sequence data for mst problems are not designed to distinguish between multiple fecal sources mcghee et al 2020 or cannot directly assess source apportioning between multiple sources roguet et al 2020 4 3 β lactamase encoding genes surveillance additionally we leveraged our metagenomes to survey for β lactamase encoding genes across the inoculum and timeseries the abundance of β lactamases across the inoculum samples was substantially higher 7 15 times compared to the control fig 4 c this result was consistent with the literature regarding heightened arg abundance within collection systems li et al 2021 specifically others have reported substantial abundances of β lactamase oxa genes on both campylobacteraceae and aeromonadaceae clades in sewage hultman et al 2018 indeed the abundance of reads belonging to β lactamase encoding genes especially of the oxa encoding class were the most abundant in the inoculum and early time points where these sewage associated clades e g pop 01 pop 19 persisted in the lake water overall these results indicated that sewage contamination imparted a substantial and lasting increase to the abundance of genes encoding β lactamases even after 7 days following the contamination event fig 4c more work is needed to elucidate the genomic context of this increased β lactamase encoding gene abundance e g whether they belong to or have been transferred to organisms capable of driving clinically relevant cases of antimicrobial resistance nonetheless our results allow for a quantitative view of the abundance of these genes relative to the natural environment which could be quite relevant for assessing associated health risks as part of future work 4 4 shotgun sequencing and monitoring environmental waters importantly although sewershed a and b showed what appears to be similar concentrations of human input according to hf183 concentrations within the inoculum si fig s1 the pathogen detection results revealed via the sequence data were quite varied fig 4b si table s6 results from both read mapping to bacterial pathogen genomes and the experimentally verified vfdb collection were consistent in suggesting that bacterial virulence may have been more elevated in the sewershed a inoculum compared to sewershed b this contrast between sewersheds with equal human marker concentrations yet apparently unequal bacterial pathogen load illustrates how shotgun sequence data can facilitate perspectives on the actual co variance of marker and pathogen yet these insights clearly depend on sufficient sequencing effort and or relatively high pathogen concentrations to avoid the possibility of false negative results in particular the estimated smallest detectable population size associated with our analysis and sequencing effort ranged between approximately 2e 05 to 1e 02 cells ml based on qpcr based cell count normalization and the sequencing effort applied materials and methods si table s2 approaches for estimating analytical lod within metagenomic based analysis remain rare within the literature especially as it relates to work done in the environment as opposed to clinical settings wendl et al 2013 ebinger et al 2021 yet the concept of detection and quantification limits in metagenomics is a major challenge to its thorough incorporation into environmental monitoring approaches because 1 it is necessary to track biomarkers or pathogens down to quite low relative abundance in the field e g at frequencies 1e 09 target basepairs total basepairs and 2 leveraging extraordinary sequencing effort is currently expensive and not practical when limitations of expertise and computational resources exist our approach provides the means to establish theoretical analytical lod for metagenomic analyses based on sequencing effort which is useful for determining and interpreting the meaning of non detects additionally using average genome size ags and total cell density estimates within the inoculum we estimate that approximately 3 5tbp of sequencing effort is necessary for detecting a population with concentration of 1e 02 cells ml within the high microbial loading conditions such as those observed in the inoculum sewage in contrast following the decline in cell density and increase in ags across the timeseries the estimated sequencing effort required to detect a population of 1e 02 cells ml drops to 10gbp in day 7 conditions which had far smaller microbial loads therefore our approach and results reported here for sequencing effort estimation may be helpful for informing the planning and execution of future environmental monitoring work utilizing metagenomic approaches si table s7 though crucial to note is the fact that our approaches for analytical lod and sequencing effort estimation assumes unbiased sequencing and does not consider sampling or processing recoveries where the latter limitation is obviously broadly applicable to all molecular methods total detection limits in the context of analytical limits as well as both sequencing bias and sampling processing recoveries will be important caveats to consider for future metagenomic workflows aiming to surveil pathogens in sewage collection systems and their releases into the natural and built environment hull et al 2019 our efforts have shown how metagenomic datasets can provide insights on multiple questions critical to environmental monitoring and water quality pathogen detection source attribution and apportioning and arg persistence in the environment in our view confident and direct detection of pathogens within metagenomic datasets will remain primarily a logistical challenge due to the large amount of sequencing effort required to reliably detect bacterial pathogens at concentrations that are very low yet still quite relevant for safeguarding public health for example we have shown how via metagenomics one could track a broad range of population sizes about five orders of magnitude from about 1e 01 to 1e 02 cells ml but that reliable detection depends on both sequencing effort and microbial load thus when performed alone metagenomic approaches are unlikely to be the most prudent technology for routine monitoring and directly informing health risks associated with sewage contamination especially when pathogen or virulence genes are at these relatively low abundances e g below 1e 02 features ml this issue is also compounded by the large contribution of non bacterial pathogens e g viruses and protozoa to illness risk in contaminated waters in contrast metagenomic approaches are increasingly poised to resolve questions related to source attribution and apportioning by improving our understanding and the size of public databases of the genomes maintained by source specific microbial populations 4 5 limitations our dataset is of limited size and scope considering that on a global scale we examined sewage from collection systems in essentially equivalent geographies the assortment of sewage associated populations described here although ubiquitous across the sewersheds we sampled likely maintain differing prevalence across time or space furthermore many draft genomes we produced are not complete so further work will be needed to establish more practical views on both the geographic range of these populations and their genomic content and diversity yet we see advancing our knowledge of sewage associated populations as a potential contribution towards newly developing forensic approaches that help monitor manage and repair essential infrastructure gonzalez et al 2020 for example we observed several highly abundant populations with a range restricted to only one or two of the three sewersheds going forward it will be important to gage whether populations or genotypes within a population exist that are specific to individual sewersheds further inquiry in this direction may also lead to strategies for resolving source attribution problems when multiple collection systems with differing catchment compositions are all possible sources of contamination in the same water environment our reporting for source apportioning fig 4a reports geq belonging to each genome library this metric represents an estimation of the fraction of prokaryote cells which we are confident belong to a particular source library yet the values reported herein should not be interpreted as representing the fraction of total fecal material belonging to a particular source additionally some signal is reported as belonging to off target libraries e g chicken despite our efforts to eliminate cross reactive genomic entries based on ani comparisons a priori we believe this signal likely belongs to genomes of populations with close relatives within either the background matrix e g freshwater or sewage microbial communities which have yet to be cataloged thus as more genomic datasets from these environments becomes available it will be important to update these source specific libraries to ensure better performance and less cross reactivity 5 conclusions we tracked the microbial dynamics of a simulated sewage spill in freshwater mesocosms for 7 days using shotgun metagenomes culture and qpcr to better establish how shotgun metagenomics can assist with water quality monitoring efforts metagenomic analysis revealed that genes related to bacterial virulence and antimicrobial resistance were substantially enriched by the addition of sewage compared to the pristine control but became markedly depleted by the 4th day genome reconstruction and comparison to available public databases suggest that collection systems likely harbor their own specific microbial populations which are largely distinct from those in other environments including the human gut genomes from publicly available datasets including those recovered by this study were compiled and analyzed to provide a set of source specific and non redundant genomic libraries a reproducible bioinformatic workflow was developed harnessing a well defined limit of detection and the source specific genome libraries developed herein to perform source attribution and apportioning of fecal signal in metagenomic datasets recovered from the water environment direct detection of pathogenic bacteria remains challenging due to the large amount of
