15645,since nanoplastics are currently considered potentially hazardous to the environment and human health reliability of studies on nanoplastic exposure becomes crucial however analytical challenges limit our understanding of their formation and detection thus hampering their biological interactions assessment here we provide a combined approach to quantitatively and qualitatively detect the release of nanoplastics in water matrix and in particular to measure direct exposure of consumers by simulated use of drinking water plastic bottles we measured that the polyethylene sealing of the bottles released particles with a size distribution ranging from few hundreds nanometers up to about one micron and estimated a mass release in the order of few tenths of nanograms per opening closing cycle we observe that mechanical stress alters the physical chemical characteristics of the generated secondary nanoplastics and degrades the material properties compared to the original bulk source thus complicating their spectroscopic chemical identification our findings demonstrate that understanding material degradation processes is therefore crucial for identifying and quantifying nanoplastics in real samples moreover methods allowing quantitative studies on the release of nanoplastic as a source of exposure are considered essential for proper assessment of their potential

environment and human s food chain conclusive evidence of their potential health hazards is not yet available lim 2021 mitrano et al 2021 np defined in this work as secondary sub micron objects resulting from fragmentation of plastic materials and exhibiting colloidal behaviour gigault et al 2021 are the most difficult to detect but potentially the most harmful particles since they are small enough to interact at a cellular level to date a definitive statement on np toxicity cannot be provided since it is agreed that insufficient scientific evidence is available about the level of exposure and their interaction with organisms zhang et al 2020 this is not surprising considering how little is currently known about the physical chemical properties of secondary nanoplastic debris depending on the measurement metric used and np model characteristics blancho et al 2021 gigault et al 2021 lin et al 2019 toxicity experiments can lead to varying outcomes kögel et al 2020 despite these knowledge gaps uptake of mp np via direct exposure from consumer goods is undisputed confirmed sources include both foods and beverages products fadare et al 2020 laborda et al 2021 such as bottled water cox et al 2019 shruti et al 2021 with focus on particulates originating from plastic packaging recently a few studies have confirmed the release of mp np by food packaging identifying different degradation pathways and unintentional sources of human consumption of secondary mp np mechanical stress to hdpe bottle screw caps i e opening and closing a drinking water bottle has been observed to release mp and identified as potential ingestion source through transfer via oral exposure weisser et al 2021 winkler et al 2019 thermal stress from heat has also been confirmed to release

coated with pe films ranjan et al 2021 and other plastic materials holding hot liquids liu et al 2022 schwabl 2020 also thermal stress through freezing had been verified to release mp np as recently observed for ice cube bags cella et al 2022 contamination of mp np can also occur by simple contact of food product with the plastic packaging as observed for e g meat in extruded polystyrene trays kedzierski et al 2020 or transfer from plastic take out containers du et al 2020 regulating bodies have thus begun discussing safety assessment actions for occurrence analysis and toxicity of nps in food and drinking water allan et al 2021 while knowledge about mp detection is increasing np studies are still lagging behind since the development of comprehensive detection strategies proved challenging mass spectroscopy based techniques can identify the presence of plastics in the ng range materić et al 2020 ter halle et al 2017 but lack characterization capabilities of microscopic methods while diffraction limited spectroscopic identification quantification techniques e g µ raman can in principle resolve sub micron individual particles in laboratory conditions gillibert et al 2019 practical issues with matrix reduction and particle concentration from real samples greatly complicate the analysis valsesia et al 2021 often a multi technique approach is needed to obtain the necessary information on chemical character shape size distribution and concentration schwaferts et al 2019 ter halle et al 2017 remarkably the approach proposed in schwaferts et al 2019 combines high resolution imaging techniques electron microscopy chemical identification techniques vibrational spectroscopies or mass spectroscopies and particle scattering techniques for a complete characterization of polymeric nanoparticles among the different particle scattering techniques single particle extinction and scattering spes has been successfully used for the counting and identification of polymeric nanoparticles in different media potenza et al 2015 sanvito et al 2017 moreover physico chemical mechanisms occurring during top down formation of secondary np from larger particles are mainly responsible for the observed heterogeneity in their material properties transfer pathways and reactivity hamzah et al 2018 liu et al 2020 together with other stressors such as photodegradation and biodegradation realistic degradation induced modifications must be taken into account while developing reliable analytical detection methods since the use of overly simplified laboratory models may lead to non representative conclusions in this study we will describe a multi technique analytical methodology for np detection identification and size distribution measurement as applied to the analysis of sub micron particulate release from drinking water bottles under realistic use conditions furthermore we identify and discuss np physical chemical properties modifications occurring during secondary formation pathways and their impact on particulate identification and quantification understanding the differences between secondary nano objects and their primary macro sources can play a crucial role in designing effective biological interaction np models and experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 study design the release of mp np particles from pet bottlenecks and hdpe cap material was determined after an opening and closing procedure to mimic the mechanical stress caused by using a bottle quantity chemical and size range analyses of released particles were performed by single particle extinction and scattering spes x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps scanning electron microscopy sem µ raman spectroscopy fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflectance ftir atr and µ ftir spectroscopy although all the methods are non destructive the analyses with sem xps µ raman and µ ftir require specific filters to provide optimal conditions for clear results which made the use of a new set of prepared samples for these instruments necessary the experimental process is described below 2 2 sample processing for sampling material preparation mineral water bottles 0 5 l from local supermarkets were purchased and the outer surface was cleaned with ethanol the bottle itself consisted of transparent pet and the cap was made of white hdpe material as indicated by the manufacturer and verified via ftir atr measurements to apply mechanical stress one bottle was opened and closed 1 10 and 50 times manually without fully removing the cap during each open close cycle the water content was previously released by cutting the bottle base with a cutter when the bottle was first opened the security ring detached from the cap and remained loose at the lower end of the bottleneck to detach the mp np released from the pet bottleneck surface and hdpe cap that passed over to the bottleneck due to the treatment the cap was removed particles were rinsed off the bottleneck by immersing it head down into a small glass beaker containing 15 ml milli q ultrapure water mq h2o so that only the bottleneck was entirely covered the bottleneck was left in the solution for 3 min while gently agitating for the analysis with spes the bottle was removed and the beaker transported to the instrument where the solution was directly analysed the same solutions were then used for µ raman and sem analysis after two concentration steps the concentration of the sample solution facilitates the analysis of volumes with low mp np concentration for spectroscopic and microscopic analyses by reducing the area of analysis to a small droplet on a suitable surface the first concentration of the solutions was performed by applying an amicon ultra 25 ml centrifugal filter having a molecular weight cut off of 100 000 kda the solution was centrifuged for 2 min at max speed 4500 x g swing bucket rotor leaving the residual sample in the top part of the amicon unit the sample reservoir contains the concentrate of which 500 µl were collected using a pipette the concentrate was transferred into an amicon ultra 0 5 ml centrifugal filter having a molecular weight cut off of 10 000 kda the sample was centrifuged for 2 min at max speed 21 130 g fixed angle resulting in a concentrated solution of 25 µl of the final concentrate 1 µl were taken with a pipette and spotted on silicon chips for raman analysis another 1 µl were spotted on cleaned flat silicon chips for sem analysis samples were dried before the analysis in addition the release of microplastic particles from the bottle material was tested by µ ftir spectroscopy an additional bottle was opened closed 50 times and the bottleneck immersed in 0 1 sodium dodecyl sulphate sds solution to aid hydrophobic particles recovery from the solution however since the analysis of one bottle opened closed 50 times could identify only one pe particle 390 µm in size fig s1 no further replicates were considered for the sake of completeness the method is described further below results and details of µ ftir analysis of the detected pe micro particle are reported in the si fig s1 2 3 quality control before proceeding with the experiments it was necessary to verify that plastic particles potentially released on the bottleneck were indeed rinsed off from the bottle by immersion in mq h2o for 3 min without the use of additional solvents accordingly sem images jeol jsm it500 of the neck of two further bottles opened closed 50 times were taken to count particles applying a semi quantitative approach one bottleneck before and one after the immersion was removed from the bottle body with a scalpel and mounted on aluminium stubs for each bottleneck three sem images with a magnification of 50 x were taken on a vertical line from the top to the bottom edge of the bottleneck surface the sem images were processed to count detected microparticles on bottlenecks before and after the immersion in mq h2o operating conditions were accelerating voltage 20 kv probe current 80 ma and working distance 15 7 17 6 mm the semi quantitative analysis on the analysed surface area of the bottleneck revealed four particles 170 550 µm in size before and no particles after the immersion of the bottle fig s2 confirming the successful removal of particles from the bottle into the water eds analysis of these particles resulted in an elemental composition of 100 carbon fig s3 which is consistent with hdpe and therefore suggesting particle derived from the cap material we included procedural lab blanks consisting of 15 µl mq h2o which underwent the same processes as the samples the blank sample was placed in another beaker close to the soaking beaker for all the time needed to process the 50 times sample then it underwent the same processes moreover pristine mq h2o directly from the distributor was analysed by spes for comparison additionally we cryomilled cap material hdpe of the same bottle brand as reference material for µ raman spectroscopy to simulate effects of mechanical stress irregular particles rather than micro and nanobeads cap material was cut into smaller pieces and placed in the sample holders polycarbonate sample holder of the cryomill cryomiller 6875 freezer mill spex together with nacl to enhance grinding milling conditions were 20 min cooling time nine cycles of 2 min and 2 min rest repeated four times all glass wear and metal cutleries were cleaned with washing detergent and rinsed with fresh mq h2o laboratory surfaces on which the preparations were performed were covered with a layer of aluminium foil all persons wore cotton lab coats or non synthetic clothes and washed their hands frequently 2 4 single particle extinction and scattering for the determination of particle number and size distribution single particle extinction and scattering analysis was performed using the classizer one eos s r l milan italy equipped with a red light diode λ 640 nm power 50 mw this light scattering method enables the analysis classification and counting of single particles in fluids based on their optical properties briefly particles passing the focal region of a light beam transmit and scatter light that can be collected onto a sensor placed in the far field of the laser beam this can give a measure of the complex amplitude of the forward scattered field via a self reference interferometric scheme potenza et al 2015 villa et al 2016 the scattered field amplitude depends on several important nanoparticles characteristics i e size refractive index n and shape that can be analysed with the technique in this work we focus on the size distribution and particle concentration the results are presented in a 2d histogram having as x and y axis the complex scattered field components re s 0 im s 0 and as z axis the concentration counts bin 1 cm 3 within each 2d bin in the complex s 0 plane potenza et al 2015 in the case of dielectric particles and under the assumption of spherical shape both size and n can be simultaneously and unambiguously determined from the s 0 raw data thanks to the mie scattering calculations even in the case of non spherical particle shapes and for particles aspect ratios ar lower than 2 3 chyacutelek et al 1976 the spherical approximation leads to a precision over the refractive index measurement better than 10 therefore the evaluation of the numerical size distribution of the whole sample was obtained by applying the dielectric sphere model the lower and upper detection limit for dielectric material such as polymers is 200 nm to 20 µm the instrument was operated with a constant flow of 4 ml per minute total analysed volume varied from 66 to 78 ml which was obtained by fluxing the sample multiple times to ensure a sufficient number of detectable particles since the method is non invasive and non destructive the suspension returned into the sample beaker and could be further used for µ raman and sem investigation in addition by approaching the analysis with the mean field approximation bohren and huffman 1998 chýlek et al 1988 and the lorentz mie method an average filling factor evaluation was performed to detect signs of agglomeration or indication for a shape similar to a ball of fibre or a porous particle the average filling factor analysis reports the filling percentage inside the detected particle of the bulk expected material hdpe or pet in our analysis analyses were performed by the software version classizerone s1 4 34 2 5 micro raman spectroscopy raman analysis was performed on the concentrated samples drop casted onto the silicon chips the samples on the chips were analysed using a witec confocal raman microscope witec ulm germany equipped with a λ 532 nm laser the scan resolution was 200 nm and the integration time per pixel was 5 s a 100 magnification object was used with numerical aperture of 1 25 univariate analysis of the hyperspectral images was performed using the witec instrument software witec suite 5 by integration of the spectra corresponding to the spectral bands between 2800 3100 cm 1 assigned to the c h stretching of polymers cosmic rays removal and baseline correction tools were applied to the spectra before univariate analysis the lowest detection limit of single isolated nanoparticles for this instrument was 0 5 µm using commercial ps beads polyscience inc the raman spectra were fitted with an appropriate number of voigt functions for each spectral band using a nonlinear least squares levemberg marquardt regression method fitting parameters were peak centres fwhm areas for each peak and the common linear baseline peak positions were constrained 5 cm 1 using literature references from hdpe bentley and hendra 1995 gaston et al 2018 snyder et al 1978 zhang et al 1997 the uncertainty of peak positions and areas were less than 0 5 cm 1 and 10 respectively mass fractions of crystalline domains trans and amorphous conformers were calculated according to the method originally suggested by strobl et al rull et al 1993 strobl and hagedorn 1978 and later adopted by several authors migler et al 2015 describing pe using a three phases model amorphous orthorhombic crystalline and non crystalline consecutive trans conformers ncct in the method the intensity of the τ ch2 twist vibration band around 1300 cm 1 is used as internal normalisation standard the band intensity ratio with its component s intensities 1298 cm 1 and 1305 cm 1 yields the trans and amorphous conformers mass fractions the reference band ratio with the 1416 cm 1 peak interchain interactions from δ ch2 ω ch2 vibrations can then be used to differentiate the mass fraction contribution from the orthorhombic crystalline regions from the non crystalline consecutive trans conformers χothorhombic χtrans χncct for comparison reference spectra acquired on the bottles bulk materials are shown in fig s4 2 6 scanning electron microscopy scanning electron microscopy sem images of concentrated samples on silicon chips were recorded using a thermofisher fei nova 600i electron microscope operating at an acceleration of 2 kv and magnification of 65x at a working distance varying from 4 to 7 mm further high resolution sem images were acquired from different sample areas with varying magnifications 1000 16000 x eds spectroscopy and mapping were carried out in a nova 600i nanolab thermofisher eindhoven the netherlands equipped with an eds system for elemental analysis edax inc mahwah nj usa the eds system mounts an octane elect plus x rays detector typical eds maps and spectra were acquired using acceleration voltage values between 10 and 25 kv with take off angle of 35 and dwell time of 200 ms 2 7 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps measurements were performed with an axis ultra spectrometer kratos manchester uk using a kα al monochromatic source hν 1486 6 ev operating at 150 w and an x ray spot size of 400 700 μm2 in the hybrid mode large spot sizes allowed to obtain good s n ratios in recorded spectra even if they can introduce drawbacks related to possible substrate contribution and require suitable film deposition method in order to overcome these issues we deposited filtered particulate films by drop casting and we used teflon strips as substrates sample preparation procedures established in literature were followed for solid bañuls ciscar et al 2020 and nanoparticles bennet et al 2020 surfaces respectively the residual pressure of the analysis chamber during the analysis was less than 8 10 9 torr for each sample both survey spectra 0 1150 ev pass energy 80 ev and high resolution spectra pass energy at 40 ev were recorded surface charge was compensated by a magnetic charge compensation system and the energy scale was calibrated by setting the c 1s hydrocarbon peak to 285 00 ev in binding energy baer and engelhard 2010 shard 2020 the data were processed using vision2 software kratos analytical uk and the analysis of the xps peaks was carried out using a commercial software package casaxps v2 3 18pr1 casa software ltd uk peak fitting was performed with no preliminary smoothing symmetric gaussian lorentzian 70 gaussian and 30 lorentzian product functions were used to approximate the line shapes of the fitting components after a 3 parameters tougaard type background subtraction concentrated samples were dispersed in mq h2o and drop casted on clean teflon substrates the use of teflon substrate allows minimizing the uncertainties in the stoichiometric evaluation of the c content of the surface mainly due to adventitious hydrocarbon contamination this is especially critical in case of low thicknesses of the analysed films the high binding energy shift of electrons originating from c f bonds and the precisely known teflon stoichiometry allows separating with high confidence the substrate and sample contributions during the c 1s peak fitting accordingly teflon substrate contribution to the c 1s signal was not considered in the elemental quantification of the sample for comparison reference spectra acquired on the bottles bulk materials are shown in fig s5 2 8 micro ftir spectroscopy for the preparation of the µ ftir analysis the particles were removed from the bottleneck as described above the solution was transferred into a standard vacuum filtration apparatus and the beaker rinsed with 5 ml mq h2o the filter membrane was whatman anodisc inorganic filter membrane diam 13 mm with a nominal pore size of 0 1 µm the membrane is composed of a high purity alumina porous matrix after filtration the membrane was placed in a clean covered petri dish for drying micro ftir microscopy was performed using a bruker infrared imaging microscope since the surface of the filters is transparent for ir radiation with wavenumbers above 1300 cm 1 measurement of all particles 10 µm approximate detection limit for this instrument in our configuration was carried out in transmission mode in a wavenumber range of 4000 1300 cm 1 transmission mode allowed for the determination of the particle minimising the interference of a potential surface cover layer or soiling the measurements were controlled by native bruker opus8 5 software for each experiment either the full or in the case of blanks at least ¼ of the surface area of the filter was analysed a total of 64 scans were taken for each spectrum with a spectral resolution of 4 cm 1 the ir absorbance was compared with spectra generated by reference material obtained from pet from bottlenecks and hdpe from bottle caps and with internal opus spectral library for comparison reference spectra acquired on the bottles bulk materials are shown in fig s6 both sides of the bottle body and screw cap were measured to expose eventual occurrence of oxidation due to weathering ageing of the polymeric materials bañuls ciscar et al 2020 in the bottle atr ftir analysis shows no differences between the two surfaces of the bottle components see fig s7 2 9 data analysis origin casaxps and microsoft excel were used for data analysis origin and inkscape were used for exporting data graphs 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphological and chemical analysis the release of mp np particles from commercial drinking water bottles was determined after several opening closing cycles 1 10 and 50 times to mimic product re utilisation the bottleneck cap system made of polyethylene terephthalate pet and polyethylene pe respectively as stated by the manufacturer and verified via ftir atr measurements was rinsed with mq h2o after opening closing cycles to recover released particulate care was taken to ensure efficient recovery and to avoid contamination from external sources chemical and size distribution analyses of released particles were performed combining scanning electron microscopy sem single particle extinction and scattering spes potenza et al 2015 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps µ raman and µ fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy for spes that allows outlining particle size distribution and concentration and µ ftir measurements the rinsing water was analysed directly while for other techniques the solution was centrifugally filtered at 104 kda cut off and concentrated on a si chip surface qualitative sem images analysis show that the amount of residual particulate recovered from the neck of water bottles after simulated use deviates from the procedural blank and increases with the number of opening closing cycles fig 1 b d indicating an accumulation of particles whose approximate size range was well below 5 µm fig 1e h sem eds elemental composition analysis on recovered particles showed almost exclusively carbon with the measured o c ratio being close to zero figs s2 and s3 this observation is compatible with common commodity thermoplastics such as pe i e bottle cap material pp and ps and with some synthetic elastomers compositions e g sbr styrene butadiene rubber epdm ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber but not with pet i e bottle material chemical identification of sub micron particles via eds is complicated due to increasing interference from surface oxidation gniadek and dąbrowska 2019 and matrix contaminations valsesia et al 2021 moreover the size range of the observed residual particulate lies below the detection limit of µ ftir spectrometers facchetti et al 2020 galafassi et al 2021 schymanski et al 2018 as already observed in previous investigations on similar systems winkler et al 2019 accordingly µ ftir analysis of the unfiltered rinsing water did not result in any statistically relevant pe or pet particle detection even though some large pe objects were occasionally detected fig s1 an xps study was conducted on both the recovered particulates in the nano range and the cleaved hdpe cap in order to chemically identify the materials through their elemental composition and stoichiometric ratios fig 2 tables s1 and s2 in fact in the hdpe spectrum fig 2c the asymmetric line shape of the main c c c h component can be used for chemical identification since it can be reliably fitted using the four symmetric c h stretch vibrational components typical of pe beamson et al 1991 however the nanoparticulate o c elemental ratio exhibits a six fold increase with respect to the cap material o chdpecap 6 5 1 8 o cnp 35 7 3 3 thus making the chemical identification based on stoichiometric ratios quite problematic in addition this increased surface oxidation fig 2e table s2 in the nanoparticle spectrum resulted in a large overlap between the c o components and the high binding energy tail of the c c c h component effectively making a univocal deconvolution of vibrational c h components not feasible 3 2 quantification and sizing we analysed particle dispersions with single particle extinction and scattering spes potenza et al 2015 a detailed description of the technique and an explanation of how to interpret data is given in the si the four panels in fig 3 show spes histograms for the procedural blank consisting of mq h2o undergoing the same manipulations as the bottle samples fig 3a and the particle dispersions recovered after 1 10 and 50 fig 3b d opening closing cycles spes data for unprocessed mq h2o are shown in fig s8 the scattering data points cluster in two slightly separated areas which can be qualitatively separated into two distinct particle populations green and blue circles in fig 3c with different size distribution characteristics and different behaviour with respect to number of opening closing cycles the first group population a characterised by a high particle concentration exhibits objects with typically sub micron dimensions d a 0 72 0 09 µm with dfwhm a 0 57 0 05 µm d90 a 1 04 0 14 µm and refractive index around na 1 42 0 01 all size distribution descriptors show little variance with the number of opening closing cycles in contrast the second group of particles population b was present at lower concentrations with typical dimensions being in the low micron range d b 2 13 0 50 µm with dfwhm b 1 90 0 46 µm d10 b 1 19 0 32 µm and nb 1 41 0 04 in this case all descriptors show higher variance with increasing cycle number the increasing integral counts of spes histograms indicates that the total particle concentration in the suspensions also increases with the number of opening closing cycles as observed in the sem pictures however the numbers of recovered particles and its dependence on the number of cycles are different when considered separately for the two particle populations see fig s8 particle counts in population a n a is at least an order of magnitude higher than in population b n b for all the experiments another significant difference is that the total number of recovered particles increased roughly linearly rpearson 0 98 r a d j 2 0 94 with the number of cycles for population a while it exhibits a plateau for population b see fig s9 this would suggest that the former could be linked to the opening closing cycles while the latter may derive from environmental contamination occurring during manipulation spes analysis fig s9 of mq h2o used for particle recovery reveals that an exceedingly small number of particles with sizes in the low micron range is already present at this stage a summary with the principal statistical descriptors characterising population a number based particle size distribution is given in table 1 for different opening closing cycles and for the control experiments the full table with all the statistical descriptors of both population a and population b particle distributions can be found in table s3 in the supporting information section the overall particle number based distributions absolute as a function of the cycle number and their cumulative distributions normalised are shown in fig 4 an effect caused by the eventual release of mp np through the detachment of the security ring from the cap during the first opening of the bottle was not observed moreover the reported numbers of released np refer to those on the bottleneck while it can be assumed that further np remained on the inner surface of caps as reported by winkler et al 2019 for mps nps in the size range of 0 54 to 39 9 µm to identify the likely source of the released particulate the refractive index derived from spes data was compared with hdpe and pet reference values the best fit between particle representative data points belonging to population a and mie scattering calculations i e with constant n contour lines in the re s 0 im s 0 plane under the assumption of spherical shape results in an average na 1 42 0 01 inset fig 3e this value does not substantially vary with the number of cycles the measured n value lies in a range compatible with polymeric materials but it is considerably smaller than the nominal values of the bottle components pet npet 1 57 and hdpe nhdpe 1 54 under the working hypothesis that particles observed in population a originate mechanically during the opening closing cycles from the bottleneck cap system we can identify at least three factors that may contribute to explaining the difference between observed and calculated refractive indices i occurrence of non isometric nanoparticles whose neffective is lower than nbulk ii occurrence of nanoparticle aggregates whose neffective is the volume average between nbulk and nmedium iii phase variations occurring during nanoparticle formation during the opening closing cycles typically namorphous ncrystallline see fig 3e as for hypothesis i it is often observed that the spherical shape assumption is rarely met in environmental and or non model samples the occurrence of complex shapes in particulate distribution has the effect of lowering the neffective value calculated from spes data potenza et al 2016 assuming quasi spherical non isometric particles with aspect ratio 3 as can be hypothesised based on sem images fig s10 the predicted neffective values chyacutelek et al 1976 would result in neffective pe 1 46 and neffective pet 1 49 support for hypothesis ii also derives from sem analysis fig s10 where the granular appearance of the filtered particulate suggests that they may be composed of smaller sub units an analysis of the filling factor ff can be made based on the mean field approximation and the lorentz mie method chýlek et al 1988 assuming the empty volume of the particles is filled with the suspension medium nh2o 1 33 to explain the experimentally observed na particle conglomerates should have ff pe 48 5 19 1 and ff pet 42 6 16 8 respectively these calculations can be qualitatively compared to experimental data using theoretical ff values predicted for relatively monodisperse randomly packed isometric hard objects depending on the packing mechanism a theoretical limiting ff ranging from 52 to 62 can be obtained a slightly higher ff could be reached if an external energy source aids conglomerate formation nava et al 2018 2017 comparing these theoretical values with the experiments we can conclude that the conglomerate s scenario is more likely to match the case of pe release hypothesis iii is made based on the observed amorphization of semicrystalline polymers during mechanical fragmentation katiyar et al 2020 optical properties of semicrystalline polymers are related to their structural characteristics such as crystalline fraction xc and the refractive index of crystalline domains is normally higher than that of amorphous regions according to their relative densities commercial pet presents xc around 20 30 determined by calorimetry bach et al 2009a and npet 1 57 while in the hdpe bottle caps an xc 80 was determined by x ray diffraction xrd measurements nava et al 2017 fig s11 and nhdpe 1 54 the refractive index of purely amorphous pet has been measured to be around namorph pet 1 54 iiyama et al 2011 while in different pe formulations the correlation between xc and n is clear e g nldpe 1 51 xc ldpe 50 nxlpe 1 49 xc xlpe 40 and namorph pe 1 47 xc amorph pe 0 some of these values have been used to calculate the constant n lines in fig 3e and compared to the data best fit line for population a the trend in particle concentrations and the three scenarios proposed in the previous paragraph are qualitatively consistent with the hypothesis that particulates in population a originate from the pe cap system under the influence of the opening closing cycles nonetheless none of these effects alone can be invoked to unambiguously explain the discrepancy between the observed na value and npe and univocal identification of the chemical nature of the nanoparticles based only on these observations is not possible 3 3 chemical identification to unequivocally identify the particle s chemical nature we further analysed the particulate residue via µ raman spectroscopy fig 5 a shows spectra in the group frequencies and characteristic ch2 stretching regions measured on the nanoparticulate recovered after 1 10 and 50 cycles particulate spectra are compared to the hdpe cap spectrum and literature bentley and hendra 1995 gaston et al 2018 snyder et al 1978 zhang et al 1997 fig s12 fig 5b e shows surface maps displaying integrated raman intensity in the spectral range between 1400 and 1500 cm 1 a region characteristic of functional group vibrations δ ch2 and δ ch3 and compatible with both natural organic materials and carbon based polymeric materials both single point raman spectra and intensity maps support the sem and spes observations which indicate that the recovered particles in the submicron size range increase in number with the number of opening closing cycles and can be distinguished from those of procedural blanks particulate chemical identification based on standard automated spectral correlation operated using different commercial and home built reference material libraries cowger et al 2021 did not show any reliable match with either the packaging materials hdpe pet expected impurities based on xps analysis or known contaminants from our preparation protocol in general spectra from recovered particulates show a marked intensity loss high signal to noise s n ratio and poorly defined broad spectral features compared to the bulk material this is due to reduced scattering material volume in the laser focal spot reduced particle size and inhomogeneous broadening effects mainly due to morphological inhomogeneity in our sample the raman bands with the highest s n were recorded for the 50 cycles sample exhibiting also the highest particulate concentration raman bands from the samples appear in similar spectral regions where the hdpe cap also exhibits raman bands however band head positions and individual peak shapes appear to be different between the bulk and the nanomaterials to gain insight into the chemical nature of the recovered nanofraction we closely analysed the group frequencies region 1000 1550 cm 1 fig 6 a b and the ν ch2 region 2775 3025 cm 1 fig 6d f the features of the spectra from recovered particulates fig 6a were compared with model nanoparticulate obtained by cryomilling hdpe bottle caps after resuspension in mq h2o and filtration with a 1 2 µm cut off filter fig 6b and the hdpe cap spectra fig 6c the cryomilled material was included to separate possible thermal effects in np formation occurring during cycling raman band assignments for semicrystalline pe molecular vibrations are well established in the literature bentley and hendra 1995 gaston et al 2018 snyder et al 1978

the different peak phase assignments are colour coded for ease of reference orange is assigned to the orthorhombic crystalline phase green for all non crystalline consecutive trans ncct migler et al 2015 configurations and blue for amorphous domains all peaks identified in the hdpe spectrum were identified and phase assigned bentley and hendra 1995 gaston et al 2018 snyder et al 1978 zhang et al 1997 and the resulting crystallinity calculated rull et al 1993 from experiments was found to be as follows xorthorhombic raman 10 3 0 5 xamorph raman 18 3 0 5 and xncct raman 71 4 0 5 this result agrees with the xrd measurements see fig s11 which give a compound crystalline fraction of xorthorhombic ncct xrd 78 9 0 5 and an amorphous fraction of xamorph xrd 21 1 0 5 in agreement also with reference values for commercial hdpe bach et al 2009b for the two nanomaterials the first band in the group frequencies region fig 6a b shows two peaks degrading towards higher wavenumbers and extends from 1000 to 1150 cm 1 the second band is a broad featureless peak centred around 1300 cm 1 while the third band shows two components of increasing intensity and extends from 1400 to 1500 cm 1 the fourth band fig 6d e is located at higher wavenumbers and extends from 2800 to 3000 cm 1 showing several poorly resolved band heads in literature the fundamental raman bands occurring in these regions have been confidently assigned to ν c c from aliphatic chains τ ch2 and δ ch2 respectively for pe and several other polyolefins corsetti et al 2017 furukawa et al 2006 snyder et al 1978 tomba et al 2019 knowing the assignment of hdpe cap spectral features allows a detailed comparison with the spectra of both types of nanoparticulate we note that the spectral features in fig 6a b can be confidently reconstructed using a subgroup of hdpe individual peaks keeping their raman shift fixed but varying intensity and fwhm the peaks observed in the nanoparticulate spectra belong either to the amorphous or trans conformations but not to the crystalline orthorhombic phase in general the following observations hold i raman shifts for different peaks do not vary in all three analysed materials fwhm increases in all nanomaterials with respect to bulk hdpe ii nanoparticulate show decreased relative intensities of ν c c and δ ch2 raman bands components assigned to trans configurations iii nanoparticulate show increased relative intensities in the same spectral regions for peaks assigned to amorphous conformational components iv nanoparticulate show a decrease and broadening of the whole τ ch2 band v the peak related to the orthorhombic crystalline phase at 1416 cm 1 is absent in the nanoparticulate moreover the spectrum of the recovered nanoparticulate qualitatively resembles spectra recorded for melt phase hdpe obtained during high temperature recrystallisation jin et al 2017 crystallinity evaluated from the two nanomaterial raman spectra is zero due to the absence of the 1416 cm 1 peak but control measurements via xrd were not possible due to the low amount of the recovered nanoparticulate and the cryomilled nanofraction remaining after filtration with the 1 2 µm cut off filters however spectra taken on the unfractionated cryomilled particulates without filtration steps with a broad size distribution spanning up to several tens of µm reveal a 40 increase of the amorphous pe fraction see fig s11 raman results are consistent with the observed reduction in the measured refractive index for population a in the spes histograms fig 2e thus supporting a scenario in which nanoparticles are produced by mechanical action during opening closing cycles and originate from the hdpe cap these secondary nanomaterials may degrade and lose their crystalline character during formation resulting in amorphous pe nanoparticles the pe assignment of the unknown nanoparticulate according to µ raman analysis implying their origin from the bottle screw cap and not from the pet made bottleneck is also supported by comparing raman ftir and edx spectra of the recovered particulate with the corresponding reference spectra for the bulk materials shown in figs s1 s3 s7 and 2c the ν chx region 2800 3000 cm 1 for the same three materials is treated separately fig 6d f as it provides a different kind of information the reference hdpe cap spectrum exhibits the common band structure for this material bentley and hendra 1995 howell et al 1999 snyder et al 1978 zhang et al 1997 the two narrow band heads can be assigned to the νs ch2 2845 cm 1 and νas ch2 2880 cm 1 modes they contain contributions from amorphous and crystalline regions and have no definite phase assignment the broad spectral features forming the high wavenumber band tail arise due to fermi resonances between the νs ch2 vibration at 2845 cm 1 and the δ ch2 at 1440 cm 1 snyder et al 1978 these broad features carry most of the integrated band intensity and their predicted raman shifts are around 2900 and 2930 cm 1 snyder et al 1978 these contributions should not be confused with νas ch3 vibrations located at slightly higher wavenumbers 2952 and 2964 cm 1 highly crystalline hdpe is normally characterized by long linear hydrocarbon chains exhibiting high molecular weight and low branching 1 resulting in an extremely low ch3 ch2 ratio so methyl terminations contributions are normally negligible for this polymer spectral analysis for the nanoparticulate reveals how typical pe ν ch2 vibrations band structure is also preserved in the two nanomaterials both νs ch2 and νas ch2 individual peaks are detected at the expected raman shift bentley and hendra 1995 even though they appear broader and less intense we also observe that their intensity ratio i2845 i2880 is slightly decreased however interpretation is not straightforward due to the relative uncertainty introduced by evaluating the contribution of the broad underlying fermi resonance bands snyder et al 1978 zhang et al 1997 a marked difference between bulk and nanomaterials spectra is the appearance of an intense band tail at high wavenumbers with non negligible intensity in the region 2930 2980 cm 1 raman intensity in this spectral region is normally not observed in common pe based materials e g hdpe this study ldpe portesi et al 2019 or xlpe fig s13 irrespective of their crystallinity degree and cross linking this band is fitted with two additional peaks fig 6d e centred at 2852 and 2964 cm 1 moreover an additional component 2871 cm 1 is observed between the two ν ch2 peaks the observed raman shifts of these peaks match with the predicted shifts and relative intensities of methyl terminations stretching modes in aliphatic chains snyder et al 1978 more precisely the assignments are νs ch3 2871 cm 1 in plane νas ch3 2852 cm 1 and its out of plane counterpart 2964 cm 1 these peaks indicate a marked increase in the number density of methyl terminations in the nanoparticulate sample compared to the cap material and could suggest the occurrence of pe linear chains scission events veitmann et al 2014 induced by mechanical stresses acting during nanoparticle formation upon cycling not surprisingly the nanomaterials ν chx band appearance is qualitatively similar to the spectral shape of the same region measured in short chained polyolefins in the liquid state tomba et al 2019 the similarity between the recovered nanoparticles spectra and the cryomilled sample supports the hypothesis that the main mechanisms responsible for nanoparticle formation and amorphization have a mechanical origin 4 conclusion in conclusion np release from drinking water plastic bottles under simulated use was observed and characterised combining sem xps spes and µ raman analysis the combination of spes and µ raman represent the minimal set of techniques necessary to apply the methodology for the quantification and identification of np in simple matrices like drinking water the size distribution of nanoparticles released from the packaging ranged from d10 a 0 38 0 03 µm to d90 a 1 04 0 14 µm possibly extending to lower sizes below the spes detection limit 200 nm nanoparticles were composed of amorphous pe likely originating from hdpe caps via mechanical action during opening closing cycles from the spes size distribution data and considering particle shape and fill factor approximations the total mass of amorphous pe in the form of nanoparticles released can be estimated not to exceed a few tenths of ng per cycle this study shows that in a realistic environment stressors acting during the top down formation of nps may alter the physical chemical characteristics of the nanoparticulate with respect to those of their original source bulk material thus hindering their identification we have found out that even mechanical stress alone acting during np formation can degrade the materials even without the occurrence of other external stressors analytical detection methods development understanding the physical chemical processes occurring during secondary generation and the design of relevant np models can be linked in a circular positive feedback loop we have shown that the design of improved analytical schemes for secondary np identification and quantification allows for further insights into material degradation fragmentation processes a deeper understanding of degradation mechanisms during secondary np formation could then be used to design improved model np materials that could be exploited for further developing analytical methods moreover the effect of degradation fragmentation pathways on physical chemical properties of the np should also be taken into account during the design of model

15645,since nanoplastics are currently considered potentially hazardous to the environment and human health reliability of studies on nanoplastic exposure becomes crucial however analytical challenges limit our understanding of their formation and detection thus hampering their biological interactions assessment here we provide a combined approach to quantitatively and qualitatively detect the release of nanoplastics in water matrix and in particular to measure direct exposure of consumers by simulated use of drinking water plastic bottles we measured that the polyethylene sealing of the bottles released particles with a size distribution ranging from few hundreds nanometers up to about one micron and estimated a mass release in the order of few tenths of nanograms per opening closing cycle we observe that mechanical stress alters the physical chemical characteristics of the generated secondary nanoplastics and degrades the material properties compared to the original bulk source thus complicating their spectroscopic chemical identification our findings demonstrate that understanding material degradation processes is therefore crucial for identifying and quantifying nanoplastics in real samples moreover methods allowing quantitative studies on the release of nanoplastic as a source of exposure are considered essential for proper assessment of their potential

resulting from fragmentation of plastic materials and exhibiting colloidal behaviour gigault et al 2021 are the most difficult to detect but potentially the most harmful particles since they are small enough to interact at a cellular level to date a definitive statement on np toxicity cannot be provided since it is agreed that insufficient scientific evidence is available about the level of exposure and their interaction with organisms zhang et al 2020 this is not surprising considering how little is currently known about the physical chemical properties of secondary nanoplastic debris depending on the measurement metric used and np model characteristics blancho et al 2021 gigault et al 2021 lin et al 2019 toxicity experiments can lead to varying outcomes kögel et al 2020 despite these knowledge gaps uptake of mp np via direct exposure from consumer goods is undisputed confirmed sources include both foods and beverages products fadare et al 2020 laborda et al 2021 such as bottled water cox et al 2019 shruti et al 2021 with focus on particulates originating from plastic packaging recently a few studies have confirmed the release of mp np by food packaging identifying different degradation pathways and unintentional sources of human consumption of secondary mp np mechanical stress to hdpe bottle screw caps i e opening and closing a drinking water bottle has been

characterization of polymeric nanoparticles among the different particle scattering techniques single particle extinction and scattering spes has been successfully used for the counting and identification of polymeric nanoparticles in different media potenza et al 2015 sanvito et al 2017 moreover physico chemical mechanisms occurring during top down formation of secondary np from larger particles are mainly responsible for the observed heterogeneity in their material properties transfer pathways and reactivity hamzah et al 2018 liu et al 2020 together with other stressors such as photodegradation and biodegradation realistic degradation induced modifications must be taken into account while developing reliable analytical detection methods since the use of overly simplified laboratory models may lead to non representative conclusions in this study we will describe a multi technique analytical methodology for np detection identification and size distribution measurement as applied to the analysis of sub micron particulate release from drinking water bottles under realistic use conditions furthermore we identify and discuss np physical chemical properties modifications occurring during secondary formation pathways and their impact on particulate identification and quantification understanding the differences between secondary nano objects and their primary macro sources can play a crucial role in designing effective biological interaction np models and experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 study design the release of mp np particles from pet bottlenecks and hdpe cap material was determined after an opening and closing procedure to mimic the mechanical stress caused by using a bottle quantity chemical and size range analyses of released particles were performed by single particle extinction and scattering spes x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps scanning electron microscopy sem µ raman spectroscopy fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflectance ftir atr and µ ftir spectroscopy although all the methods are non destructive the analyses with sem xps µ raman and µ ftir require specific filters to provide optimal conditions for clear results which made the use of a new set of prepared samples for these instruments necessary the experimental process is described below 2 2 sample processing for sampling material preparation mineral water bottles 0 5 l from local supermarkets were purchased and the outer surface was cleaned with ethanol the bottle itself consisted of transparent pet and the cap was made of white hdpe material as indicated by the manufacturer and verified via ftir atr measurements to apply mechanical stress one bottle was opened and closed 1 10 and 50 times manually without fully removing the cap during each open close cycle the water content was previously released by cutting the bottle base with a cutter when the bottle was first opened the security ring detached from the cap and remained loose at the lower end of the bottleneck to detach the mp np released from the pet bottleneck surface and hdpe cap that passed over to the bottleneck due to the treatment the cap was removed particles were rinsed off the bottleneck by immersing it head down into a small glass beaker containing 15 ml milli q ultrapure water mq h2o so that only the bottleneck was entirely covered the bottleneck was left in the solution for 3 min while gently agitating for the analysis with spes the bottle was removed and the beaker transported to the instrument where the solution was directly analysed the same solutions were then used for µ raman and sem analysis after two concentration steps the concentration of the sample solution facilitates the analysis of volumes with low mp np concentration for spectroscopic and microscopic analyses by reducing the area of analysis to a small droplet on a suitable surface the first concentration of the solutions was performed by applying an amicon ultra 25 ml centrifugal filter having a molecular weight cut off of 100 000 kda the solution was centrifuged for 2 min at max speed 4500 x g swing bucket rotor leaving the residual sample in the top part of the amicon unit the sample reservoir contains the concentrate of which 500 µl were collected using a pipette the concentrate was transferred into an amicon ultra 0 5 ml centrifugal filter having a molecular weight cut off of 10 000 kda the sample was centrifuged for 2 min at max speed 21 130 g fixed angle resulting in a concentrated solution of 25 µl of the final concentrate 1 µl were taken with a pipette and spotted on silicon chips for raman analysis another 1 µl were spotted on cleaned flat silicon chips for sem analysis samples were dried before the analysis in addition the release of microplastic particles from the bottle material was tested by µ ftir spectroscopy an additional bottle was opened closed 50 times and the bottleneck immersed in 0 1 sodium dodecyl sulphate sds solution to aid hydrophobic particles recovery from the solution however since the analysis of one bottle opened closed 50 times could identify only one pe particle 390 µm in size fig s1 no further replicates were considered for the sake of completeness the method is described further below results and details of µ ftir analysis of the detected pe micro particle are reported in the si fig s1 2 3 quality control before proceeding with the experiments it was necessary to verify that plastic particles potentially released on the bottleneck were indeed rinsed off from the bottle by immersion in mq h2o for 3 min without the use of additional solvents accordingly sem images jeol jsm it500 of the neck of two further bottles opened closed 50 times were taken to count particles applying a semi quantitative approach one bottleneck before and one after the immersion was removed from the bottle body with a scalpel and mounted on aluminium stubs for each bottleneck three sem images with a magnification of 50 x were taken on a vertical line from the top to the bottom edge of the bottleneck surface the sem images were processed to count detected microparticles on bottlenecks before and after the immersion in mq h2o operating conditions were accelerating voltage 20 kv probe current 80 ma and working distance 15 7 17 6 mm the semi quantitative analysis on the analysed surface area of the bottleneck revealed four particles 170 550 µm in size before and no particles after the immersion of the bottle fig s2 confirming the successful removal of particles from the bottle into the water eds analysis of these particles resulted in an elemental composition of 100 carbon fig s3 which is consistent with hdpe and therefore suggesting particle derived from the cap material we included procedural lab blanks consisting of 15 µl mq h2o which underwent the same processes as the samples the blank sample was placed in another beaker close to the soaking beaker for all the time needed to process the 50 times sample then it underwent the same processes moreover pristine mq h2o directly from the distributor was analysed by spes for comparison additionally we cryomilled cap material hdpe of the same bottle brand as reference material for µ raman spectroscopy to simulate effects of mechanical stress irregular particles rather than micro and nanobeads cap material was cut into smaller pieces and placed in the sample holders polycarbonate sample holder of the cryomill cryomiller 6875 freezer mill spex together with nacl to enhance grinding milling conditions were 20 min cooling time nine cycles of 2 min and 2 min rest repeated four times all glass wear and metal cutleries were cleaned with washing detergent and rinsed with fresh mq h2o laboratory surfaces on which the preparations were performed were covered with a layer of aluminium foil all persons wore cotton lab coats or non synthetic clothes and washed their hands frequently 2 4 single particle extinction and scattering for the determination of particle number and size distribution single particle extinction and scattering analysis was performed using the classizer one eos s r l milan italy equipped with a red light diode λ 640 nm power 50 mw this light scattering method enables the analysis classification and counting of single particles in fluids based on their optical properties briefly particles passing the focal region of a light beam transmit and scatter light that can be collected onto a sensor placed in the far field of the laser beam this can give a measure of the complex amplitude of the forward scattered field via a self reference interferometric scheme potenza et al 2015 villa et al 2016 the scattered field amplitude depends on several important nanoparticles characteristics i e size refractive index n and shape that can be analysed with the technique in this work we focus on the size distribution and particle concentration the results are presented in a 2d histogram having as x and y axis the complex scattered field components re s 0 im s 0 and as z axis the concentration counts bin 1 cm 3 within each 2d bin in the complex s 0 plane potenza et al 2015 in the case of dielectric particles and under the assumption of spherical shape both size and n can be simultaneously and unambiguously determined from the s 0 raw data thanks to the mie scattering calculations even in the case of non spherical particle shapes and for particles aspect ratios ar lower than 2 3 chyacutelek et al 1976 the spherical approximation leads to a precision over the refractive index measurement better than 10 therefore the evaluation of the numerical size distribution of the whole sample was obtained by applying the dielectric sphere model the lower and upper detection limit for dielectric material such as polymers is 200 nm to 20 µm the instrument was operated with a constant flow of 4 ml per minute total analysed volume varied from 66 to 78 ml which was obtained by fluxing the sample multiple times to ensure a sufficient number of detectable particles since the method is non invasive and non destructive the suspension returned into the sample beaker and could be further used for µ raman and sem investigation in addition by approaching the analysis with the mean field approximation bohren and huffman 1998 chýlek et al 1988 and the lorentz mie method an average filling factor evaluation was performed to detect signs of agglomeration or indication for a shape similar to a ball of fibre or a porous particle the average filling factor analysis reports the filling percentage inside the detected particle of the bulk expected material hdpe or pet in our analysis analyses were performed by the software version classizerone s1 4 34 2 5 micro raman spectroscopy raman analysis was performed on the concentrated samples drop casted onto the silicon chips the samples on the chips were analysed using a witec confocal raman microscope witec ulm germany equipped with a λ 532 nm laser the scan resolution was 200 nm and the integration time per pixel was 5 s a 100 magnification object was used with numerical aperture of 1 25 univariate analysis of the hyperspectral images was performed using the witec instrument software witec suite 5 by integration of the spectra corresponding to the spectral bands between 2800 3100 cm 1 assigned to the c h stretching of polymers cosmic rays removal and baseline correction tools were applied to the spectra before univariate analysis the lowest detection limit of single isolated nanoparticles for this instrument was 0 5 µm using commercial ps beads polyscience inc the raman spectra were fitted with an appropriate number of voigt functions for each spectral band using a nonlinear least squares levemberg marquardt regression method fitting parameters were peak centres fwhm areas for each peak and the common linear baseline peak positions were constrained 5 cm 1 using literature references from hdpe bentley and hendra 1995 gaston et al 2018 snyder et al 1978 zhang et al 1997 the uncertainty of peak positions and areas were less than 0 5 cm 1 and 10 respectively mass fractions of crystalline domains trans and amorphous conformers were calculated according to the method originally suggested by strobl et al rull et al 1993 strobl and hagedorn 1978 and later adopted by several authors migler et al 2015 describing pe using a three phases model amorphous orthorhombic crystalline and non crystalline consecutive trans conformers ncct in the method the intensity of the τ ch2 twist vibration band around 1300 cm 1 is used as internal normalisation standard the band intensity ratio with its component s intensities 1298 cm 1 and 1305 cm 1 yields the trans and amorphous conformers mass fractions the reference band ratio with the 1416 cm 1 peak interchain interactions from δ ch2 ω ch2 vibrations can then be used to differentiate the mass fraction contribution from the orthorhombic crystalline regions from the non crystalline consecutive trans conformers χothorhombic χtrans χncct for comparison reference spectra acquired on the bottles bulk materials are shown in fig s4 2 6 scanning electron microscopy scanning electron microscopy sem images of concentrated samples on silicon chips were recorded using a thermofisher fei nova 600i electron microscope operating at an acceleration of 2 kv and magnification of 65x at a working distance varying from 4 to 7 mm further high resolution sem images were acquired from different sample areas with varying magnifications 1000 16000 x eds spectroscopy and mapping were carried out in a nova 600i nanolab thermofisher eindhoven the netherlands equipped with an eds system for elemental analysis edax inc mahwah nj usa the eds system mounts an octane elect plus x rays detector typical eds maps and spectra were acquired using acceleration voltage values between 10 and 25 kv with take off angle of 35 and dwell time of 200 ms 2 7 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps measurements were performed with an axis ultra spectrometer kratos manchester uk using a kα al monochromatic source hν 1486 6 ev operating at 150 w and an x ray spot size of 400 700 μm2 in the hybrid mode large spot sizes allowed to obtain good s n ratios in recorded spectra even if they can introduce drawbacks related to possible substrate contribution and require suitable film deposition method in order to overcome these issues we deposited filtered particulate films by drop casting and we used teflon strips as substrates sample preparation procedures established in literature were followed for solid bañuls ciscar et al 2020 and nanoparticles bennet et al 2020 surfaces respectively the residual pressure of the analysis chamber during the analysis was less than 8 10 9 torr for each sample both survey spectra 0 1150 ev pass energy 80 ev and high resolution spectra pass energy at 40 ev were recorded surface charge was compensated by a magnetic charge compensation system and the energy scale was calibrated by setting the c 1s hydrocarbon peak to 285 00 ev in binding energy baer and engelhard 2010 shard 2020 the data were processed using vision2 software kratos analytical uk and the analysis of the xps peaks was carried out using a commercial software package casaxps v2 3 18pr1 casa software ltd uk peak fitting was performed with no preliminary smoothing symmetric gaussian lorentzian 70 gaussian and 30 lorentzian product functions were used to approximate the line shapes of the fitting components after a 3 parameters tougaard type background subtraction concentrated samples were dispersed in mq h2o and drop casted on clean teflon substrates the use of teflon substrate allows minimizing the uncertainties in the stoichiometric evaluation of the c content of the surface mainly due to adventitious hydrocarbon contamination this is especially critical in case of low thicknesses of the analysed films the high binding energy shift of electrons originating from c f bonds and the precisely known teflon stoichiometry allows separating with high confidence the substrate and sample contributions during the c 1s peak fitting accordingly teflon substrate contribution to the c 1s signal was not considered in the elemental quantification of the sample for comparison reference spectra acquired on the bottles bulk materials are shown in fig s5 2 8 micro ftir spectroscopy for the preparation of the µ ftir analysis the particles were removed from the bottleneck as described above the solution was transferred into a standard vacuum filtration apparatus and the beaker rinsed with 5 ml mq h2o the filter membrane was whatman anodisc inorganic filter membrane diam 13 mm with a nominal pore size of 0 1 µm the membrane is composed of a high purity alumina porous matrix after filtration the membrane was placed in a clean covered petri dish for drying micro ftir microscopy was performed using a bruker infrared imaging microscope since the surface of the filters is transparent for ir radiation with wavenumbers above 1300 cm 1 measurement of all particles 10 µm approximate detection limit for this instrument in our configuration was carried out in transmission mode in a wavenumber range of 4000 1300 cm 1 transmission mode allowed for the determination of the particle minimising the interference of a potential surface cover layer or soiling the measurements were controlled by native bruker opus8 5 software for each experiment either the full or in the case of blanks at least ¼ of the surface area of the filter was analysed a total of 64 scans were taken for each spectrum with a spectral resolution of 4 cm 1 the ir absorbance was compared with spectra generated by reference material obtained from pet from bottlenecks and hdpe from bottle caps and with internal opus spectral library for comparison reference spectra acquired on the bottles bulk materials are shown in fig s6 both sides of the bottle body and screw cap were measured to expose eventual occurrence of oxidation due to weathering ageing of the polymeric materials bañuls ciscar et al 2020 in the bottle atr ftir analysis shows no differences between the two surfaces of the bottle components see fig s7 2 9 data analysis origin casaxps and microsoft excel were used for data analysis origin and inkscape were used for exporting data graphs 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphological and chemical analysis the release of mp np particles from commercial drinking water bottles was determined after several opening closing cycles 1 10 and 50 times to mimic product re utilisation the bottleneck cap system made of polyethylene terephthalate pet and polyethylene pe respectively as stated by the manufacturer and verified via ftir atr measurements was rinsed with mq h2o after opening closing cycles to recover released particulate care was taken to ensure efficient recovery and to avoid contamination from external sources chemical and size distribution analyses of released particles were performed combining scanning electron microscopy sem single particle extinction and scattering spes potenza et al 2015 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps µ raman and µ fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy for spes that allows outlining particle size distribution and concentration and µ ftir measurements the rinsing water was analysed directly while for other techniques the solution was centrifugally filtered at 104 kda cut off and concentrated on a si chip surface qualitative sem images analysis show that the amount of residual particulate recovered from the neck of water bottles after simulated use deviates from the procedural blank and increases with the number of opening closing cycles fig 1 b d indicating an accumulation of particles whose approximate size range was well below 5 µm fig 1e h sem eds elemental composition analysis on recovered particles showed almost exclusively carbon with the measured o c ratio being close to zero figs s2 and s3 this observation is compatible with common commodity thermoplastics such as pe i e bottle cap material pp and ps and with some synthetic elastomers compositions e g sbr styrene butadiene rubber epdm ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber but not with pet i e bottle material chemical identification of sub micron particles via eds is complicated due to increasing interference from surface oxidation gniadek and dąbrowska 2019 and matrix contaminations valsesia et al 2021 moreover the size range of the observed residual particulate lies below the detection limit of µ ftir spectrometers facchetti et al 2020 galafassi et al 2021 schymanski et al 2018 as already observed in previous investigations on similar systems winkler et al 2019 accordingly µ ftir analysis of the unfiltered rinsing water did not result in any statistically relevant pe or pet particle detection even though some large pe objects were occasionally detected fig s1 an xps study was conducted on both the recovered particulates in the nano range and the cleaved hdpe cap in order to chemically identify the materials through their elemental composition and stoichiometric ratios fig 2 tables s1 and s2 in fact in the hdpe spectrum fig 2c the asymmetric line shape of the main c c c h component

elemental ratio exhibits a six fold increase with respect to the cap material o chdpecap 6 5 1 8 o cnp 35 7 3 3 thus making the chemical identification based on stoichiometric ratios quite problematic in addition this increased surface oxidation fig 2e table s2 in the nanoparticle spectrum resulted in a large overlap between the c o components and the high binding energy tail of the c c c h component effectively making a univocal deconvolution of vibrational c h components not feasible 3 2 quantification and sizing we analysed particle dispersions with single particle extinction and scattering spes potenza et al 2015 a detailed description of the technique and an explanation of how to interpret data is given in the si the four panels in fig 3 show spes histograms for the procedural blank consisting of mq h2o undergoing the same manipulations as the bottle samples fig 3a and the particle dispersions recovered after 1 10 and 50 fig 3b d opening closing cycles spes data for unprocessed mq h2o are shown in fig s8 the scattering data points cluster in two slightly separated areas which can be qualitatively separated into two distinct particle populations green and blue circles in fig 3c with different size distribution characteristics and different behaviour with respect to number of opening closing cycles the first group population a characterised by a high particle concentration exhibits objects with typically sub micron dimensions d a 0 72 0 09 µm with dfwhm a 0 57 0 05 µm d90 a 1 04 0 14 µm and refractive index around na 1 42 0 01 all size distribution descriptors show little variance with the number of opening closing cycles in contrast the second group of particles population b was present at lower concentrations with typical dimensions being in the low micron range d b 2 13 0 50 µm with dfwhm b 1 90 0 46 µm d10 b 1 19 0 32 µm and nb 1 41 0 04 in this case all descriptors show higher variance with increasing cycle number the increasing integral counts of spes histograms indicates that the total particle concentration in the suspensions also increases with the number of opening closing cycles as observed in the sem pictures however the numbers of recovered particles and its dependence on the number of cycles are different when considered separately for the two particle populations see fig s8 particle counts in population a n a is at least an order of magnitude higher than in population b n b for all the experiments another significant difference is that the total number of recovered particles increased roughly linearly rpearson 0 98 r a d j 2 0 94 with the number of cycles for population a while it exhibits a plateau for population b see fig s9 this would suggest that the former could be linked to the opening closing cycles while the latter may derive from environmental contamination occurring during manipulation spes analysis fig s9 of mq h2o used for particle recovery reveals that an exceedingly small number of particles with sizes in the low micron range is already present at this stage a summary with the principal statistical descriptors characterising population a number based particle size distribution is given in table 1 for different opening closing cycles and for the control experiments the full table with all the statistical descriptors of both population a and population b particle distributions can be found in table s3 in the supporting information section the overall particle number based distributions absolute as a function of the cycle number and their cumulative distributions normalised are shown in fig 4 an effect caused by the eventual release of mp np through the detachment of the security ring from the cap during the first opening of the bottle was not observed moreover the reported numbers of released np refer to those on the bottleneck while it can be assumed that further np remained on the inner surface of caps as reported by winkler et al 2019 for mps nps in the size range of 0 54 to 39 9 µm to identify the likely source of the released particulate the refractive index derived from spes data was compared with hdpe and pet reference values the best fit between particle representative data points belonging to population a and mie scattering calculations i e with constant n contour lines in the re s 0 im s 0 plane under the assumption of spherical shape results in an average na 1 42 0 01 inset fig 3e this value does not substantially vary with the number of cycles the measured n value lies in a range compatible with polymeric materials but it is considerably smaller than the nominal values of the bottle components pet npet 1 57 and hdpe nhdpe 1 54 under the working hypothesis that particles observed in population a originate mechanically during the opening closing cycles from the bottleneck cap system we can identify at least three factors that may contribute to explaining the difference between observed and calculated refractive indices i occurrence of non isometric nanoparticles whose neffective is lower than nbulk ii occurrence of nanoparticle aggregates whose neffective is the volume average between nbulk and nmedium iii phase variations occurring during nanoparticle formation during the opening closing cycles typically namorphous ncrystallline see fig 3e as for hypothesis i it is often observed that the spherical shape assumption is rarely met in environmental and or non model samples the occurrence of complex shapes in particulate distribution has the effect of lowering the neffective value calculated from spes data potenza et al 2016 assuming quasi spherical non isometric particles with aspect ratio 3 as can be hypothesised based on sem images fig s10 the predicted neffective values chyacutelek et al 1976 would result in neffective pe 1 46 and neffective pet 1 49 support for hypothesis ii also derives from sem analysis fig s10 where the granular appearance of the filtered particulate suggests that they may be composed of smaller sub units an analysis of the filling factor ff can be made based on the mean field approximation and the lorentz mie method chýlek et al 1988 assuming the empty volume of the particles is filled with the suspension medium nh2o 1 33 to explain the experimentally observed na particle conglomerates should have ff pe 48 5 19 1 and ff pet 42 6 16 8 respectively these calculations can be qualitatively compared to experimental data using theoretical ff values predicted for relatively monodisperse randomly packed isometric hard objects depending on the packing mechanism a theoretical limiting ff ranging from 52 to 62 can be obtained a slightly higher ff could be reached if an external energy source aids conglomerate formation nava et al 2018 2017 comparing these theoretical values with the experiments we can conclude that the conglomerate s scenario is more likely to match the case of pe release hypothesis iii is made based on the observed amorphization of semicrystalline polymers during mechanical fragmentation katiyar et al 2020 optical properties of semicrystalline polymers are related to their structural characteristics such as crystalline fraction xc and the refractive index of crystalline domains is normally higher than that of amorphous regions according to their relative densities commercial pet presents xc around 20 30 determined by calorimetry bach et al 2009a and npet 1 57 while in the hdpe bottle caps an xc 80 was determined by x ray diffraction xrd measurements nava et al 2017 fig s11 and nhdpe 1 54 the refractive index of purely amorphous pet has been measured to be around namorph pet 1 54 iiyama et al 2011 while in different pe formulations the correlation between xc and n is clear e g nldpe 1 51 xc ldpe 50 nxlpe 1 49 xc xlpe 40 and namorph pe 1 47 xc amorph pe 0 some of these values have been used to calculate the constant n lines in fig 3e and compared to the data best fit line for population a the trend in particle concentrations and the three scenarios proposed in the previous paragraph are qualitatively consistent with the hypothesis that particulates in population a originate from the pe cap system under the influence of the opening closing cycles nonetheless none of these effects alone can be invoked to unambiguously explain the discrepancy between the observed na value and npe and univocal identification of the chemical nature of the nanoparticles based only on these observations is not possible 3 3 chemical identification to unequivocally identify the particle s chemical nature we further analysed the particulate residue via µ raman spectroscopy fig 5 a shows spectra in the group frequencies and characteristic ch2 stretching regions measured on the nanoparticulate recovered after 1 10 and 50 cycles particulate spectra are compared to the hdpe cap spectrum and literature bentley and hendra 1995 gaston et al 2018 snyder et al 1978 zhang et al 1997 fig s12 fig 5b e shows surface maps displaying integrated raman intensity in the spectral range between 1400 and 1500 cm 1 a region characteristic of functional group vibrations δ ch2 and δ ch3 and compatible with both natural organic materials and carbon based polymeric materials both single point raman spectra and intensity maps support the sem and spes observations which indicate that the recovered particles in the submicron size range increase in number with the number of opening closing cycles and can be distinguished from those of procedural blanks particulate chemical identification based on standard automated spectral correlation operated using different commercial and home built reference material libraries cowger et al 2021 did not show any reliable match with either the packaging materials hdpe pet expected impurities based on xps analysis or known contaminants from our preparation protocol in general spectra from recovered particulates show a marked intensity loss high signal to noise s n ratio and poorly defined broad spectral features compared to the bulk material this is due to reduced scattering material volume in the laser focal spot reduced particle size and inhomogeneous broadening effects mainly due to morphological inhomogeneity in our sample the raman bands with the highest s n were recorded for the 50 cycles sample exhibiting also the highest particulate concentration raman bands from the samples appear in similar spectral regions where the hdpe cap also exhibits raman bands however band head positions and individual peak shapes appear to be different between the bulk and the nanomaterials to gain insight into the chemical nature of the recovered nanofraction we closely analysed the group frequencies region 1000 1550 cm 1 fig 6 a b and the ν ch2 region 2775 3025 cm 1 fig 6d f the features of the spectra from recovered particulates fig 6a were compared with model nanoparticulate obtained by cryomilling hdpe bottle caps after resuspension in mq h2o and filtration with a 1 2 µm cut off filter fig 6b and the hdpe cap spectra fig 6c the cryomilled material was included to separate possible thermal effects in np formation occurring during cycling raman band assignments for semicrystalline pe molecular vibrations are well established in the literature bentley and hendra 1995 gaston et al 2018 snyder et al 1978 zhang et al 1997 table s4 summarises the raman shifts vibrational modes and structural phase assignments for all the individual peaks obtained from band envelopes deconvolution shown in fig 6 in fig 6 the different peak phase assignments are colour coded for ease of reference orange is assigned to the orthorhombic crystalline phase green for all non crystalline consecutive trans ncct migler et al 2015 configurations and blue for amorphous domains all peaks identified in the hdpe spectrum were identified and phase assigned bentley and hendra 1995 gaston et al 2018 snyder et al 1978 zhang et al 1997 and the resulting crystallinity calculated rull et al 1993 from experiments was found to be as follows xorthorhombic raman 10 3 0 5 xamorph raman 18 3 0 5 and xncct raman 71 4 0 5 this result agrees with the xrd measurements see fig s11 which give a compound crystalline fraction of xorthorhombic ncct xrd 78 9 0 5 and an amorphous fraction of xamorph xrd 21 1 0 5 in agreement also with reference values for commercial hdpe bach et al 2009b for the two nanomaterials the first band in the group frequencies region fig 6a b shows two peaks degrading towards higher wavenumbers and extends from 1000 to 1150 cm 1 the second band is a broad featureless peak centred around 1300 cm 1 while the third band shows two components of increasing intensity and extends from 1400 to 1500 cm 1 the fourth band fig 6d e is located at higher wavenumbers and extends from 2800 to 3000 cm 1 showing several poorly resolved band heads in literature the fundamental raman bands occurring in these regions have been confidently assigned to ν c c from aliphatic chains τ ch2 and δ ch2 respectively for pe and several other polyolefins corsetti et al 2017 furukawa et al 2006 snyder et al 1978 tomba et al 2019 knowing the assignment of hdpe cap spectral features allows a detailed comparison with the spectra of both types of nanoparticulate we note that the spectral features in fig 6a b can be confidently reconstructed using a subgroup of hdpe individual peaks keeping their raman shift fixed but varying intensity and fwhm the peaks observed in the nanoparticulate spectra belong either to the amorphous or trans conformations but not to the crystalline orthorhombic phase in general the following observations hold i raman shifts for different peaks do not vary in all three analysed materials fwhm increases in all nanomaterials with respect to bulk hdpe ii nanoparticulate show decreased relative intensities of ν c c and δ ch2 raman bands components assigned to trans configurations iii nanoparticulate show increased relative intensities in the same spectral regions for peaks assigned to amorphous conformational components iv nanoparticulate show a decrease and broadening of the whole τ ch2 band v the peak related to the orthorhombic crystalline phase at 1416 cm 1 is absent in the nanoparticulate moreover the spectrum of the recovered nanoparticulate qualitatively resembles spectra recorded for melt phase hdpe obtained during high temperature recrystallisation jin et al 2017 crystallinity evaluated from the two nanomaterial raman spectra is zero due to the absence of the 1416 cm 1 peak but control measurements via xrd were not possible due to the low amount of the recovered nanoparticulate and the cryomilled nanofraction remaining after filtration with the 1 2 µm cut off filters however spectra taken on the unfractionated cryomilled particulates without filtration steps with a broad size distribution spanning up to several tens of µm reveal a 40 increase of the amorphous pe fraction see fig s11 raman results are consistent with the observed reduction in the measured refractive index for population a in the spes histograms fig 2e thus supporting a scenario in which nanoparticles are produced by mechanical action during opening closing cycles and originate from the hdpe cap these secondary nanomaterials may degrade and lose their crystalline character during formation resulting in amorphous pe nanoparticles the pe assignment of the unknown nanoparticulate according to µ raman analysis implying their origin from the bottle screw cap and not from the pet made bottleneck is also supported by comparing raman ftir and edx spectra of the recovered particulate with the corresponding reference spectra for the bulk materials shown in figs s1 s3 s7 and 2c the ν chx region 2800 3000 cm 1 for the same three materials is treated separately fig 6d f as it provides a different kind of information the reference hdpe cap spectrum exhibits the common band structure for this material bentley and hendra 1995 howell et al 1999 snyder et al 1978 zhang et al 1997 the two narrow band heads can be assigned to the νs ch2 2845 cm 1 and νas ch2 2880 cm 1 modes they contain contributions from amorphous and crystalline regions and have no definite phase assignment the broad spectral features forming the high wavenumber band tail arise due to fermi resonances between the νs ch2 vibration at 2845 cm 1 and the δ ch2 at 1440 cm 1 snyder et al 1978 these broad features carry most of the integrated band intensity and their predicted raman shifts are around 2900 and 2930 cm 1 snyder et al 1978 these contributions should not be confused with νas ch3 vibrations located at slightly higher wavenumbers 2952 and 2964 cm 1 highly crystalline hdpe is normally characterized by long linear hydrocarbon chains exhibiting high molecular weight and low branching 1 resulting in an extremely low ch3 ch2 ratio so methyl terminations contributions are normally negligible for this polymer spectral analysis for the nanoparticulate reveals how typical pe ν ch2 vibrations band structure is also preserved in the two nanomaterials both νs ch2 and νas ch2 individual peaks are detected at the expected raman shift bentley and hendra 1995 even though they appear broader and less intense we also observe that their intensity ratio i2845 i2880 is slightly decreased however interpretation is not straightforward due to the relative uncertainty introduced by evaluating the contribution of the broad underlying fermi resonance bands snyder et al 1978 zhang et al 1997 a marked difference between bulk and nanomaterials spectra is the appearance of an intense band tail at high wavenumbers with non negligible intensity in the region 2930 2980 cm 1 raman intensity in this spectral region is normally not observed in common pe based materials e g hdpe this study ldpe portesi et al 2019 or xlpe fig s13 irrespective of their crystallinity degree and cross linking this band is fitted with two additional peaks fig 6d e centred at 2852 and 2964 cm 1 moreover an additional component 2871 cm 1 is observed between the two ν ch2 peaks the observed raman shifts of these peaks match with the predicted shifts and relative intensities of methyl terminations stretching modes in aliphatic chains snyder et al 1978 more precisely the assignments are νs ch3 2871 cm 1 in plane νas ch3 2852 cm 1 and its out of plane counterpart 2964 cm 1 these peaks indicate a marked increase in the number density of methyl terminations in the nanoparticulate sample compared to the cap material and could suggest the occurrence of pe linear chains scission events veitmann et al 2014 induced by mechanical stresses acting during nanoparticle formation upon cycling not surprisingly the nanomaterials ν chx band appearance is qualitatively similar to the spectral shape of the same region measured in short chained polyolefins in the liquid state tomba et al 2019 the similarity between the recovered nanoparticles spectra and the cryomilled sample supports the hypothesis that the main mechanisms responsible for nanoparticle formation and amorphization have a mechanical origin 4 conclusion in conclusion np release from drinking water plastic bottles under simulated use was observed and characterised combining sem xps spes and µ raman analysis the combination of spes and µ raman represent the minimal set of techniques necessary to apply the methodology for the quantification and identification of np in simple matrices like drinking water the size distribution of nanoparticles released from the packaging ranged from d10 a 0 38 0 03 µm to d90 a 1 04 0 14 µm possibly extending to lower sizes below the spes detection limit 200 nm nanoparticles were composed of amorphous pe likely originating from hdpe caps via mechanical action during opening closing cycles from the spes size distribution data and considering particle shape and fill factor approximations the total mass of amorphous pe in the form of nanoparticles released can be estimated not to exceed a few tenths of ng per cycle this study shows that in a realistic environment stressors acting during the top down formation of nps may alter the physical chemical characteristics of the nanoparticulate with respect to those of their original source bulk material thus hindering their identification we have found out that even mechanical stress alone acting during np formation can degrade the materials even without the occurrence of other external stressors analytical detection methods development understanding the physical chemical processes occurring during secondary generation and the design of relevant np models can be linked in a circular positive feedback loop we have shown that the design of improved analytical schemes for secondary np identification and quantification allows for further insights into material degradation fragmentation processes a deeper understanding of degradation mechanisms during secondary np formation could then be used to design improved model np materials that could be exploited for further developing analytical methods moreover the effect of degradation fragmentation pathways on physical chemical properties of the np should also be taken into account during the design of model engineered nanomaterials for use in studies about secondary np fate effects on human health sampling and analysis gigault et al 2021 author contributions the manuscript was written through

15646,rivers serve as regulators of global climate by releasing greenhouse gases burying particulate carbon and connecting different ecosystem carbon pools however long term organic carbon oc transport features across different asian rivers are not well known due to unavailable data based on routinely monitored environmental and hydrological data during 2004 2018 this study investigated the spatiotemporal variations in dissolved doc and particulate oc poc transport across 41 rivers in china across different rivers both doc 1 35 16 8 mg l and poc 0 27 4 48 mg l concentrations covered wide ranges the doc content was high in the north and low in the south with significantly higher t test p 0 01 values for rivers north of 30 n 5 39 3 66 mg l vs 2 39 1 14 mg l human activities greatly influenced the riverine doc and poc distributions the riverine ammonia nitrogen nh 4 n content was positively correlated with doc r 0 81 and p 0 01 and explained 85 59 of its spatial variation high vegetation coverage had significant effects on decreasing the riverine poc content with r 0 55 and p 0 05 during 2004 2018 water pollution prevention and control strategies decreased doc concentrations in 60 98 of rivers meanwhile anthropogenic vegetation restoration and dam construction led to poc content decreases in 90 48 of rivers importantly along with doc and poc changes increasing doc poc ratios were found in 90 48 of the rivers with 42 86 being significant which indicated that chinese rivers are losing their asian features of low doc poc ratios due to artificial disturbance this study is significant for accurately quantifying greenhouse gas emissions carbon burial and oc export to estuaries by chinese rivers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords organic carbon spatiotemporal variations driving forces human activities chinese rivers data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rivers play essential roles in connecting the carbon pools of the land lake and ocean ecosystems maavara et al 2017 tranvik et al 2009 wang et al 2012 annually global rivers transport approximately 5100 tg c yr 70 of net land carbon sink 1 tg 1012 g from the land to inland waters and then further pour 900 tg c yr into estuaries drake et al 2018 riverine carbon transport from highland to lowland areas is nonreversible and records the natural processes and human activities in catchments liu et al 2020 ludwig et al 1996 maavara et al 2017 however the organic carbon oc proportions in different rivers are still unknown and have latitudinal differences tranvik et al 2009 moreover the oc related matter will deteriorate water quality by consuming dissolved oxygen through aerobic decomposition liu et al 2020 tranvik et al 2009 influence phytoplankton growth by absorbing light liu et al 2020 and regulate the global carbon cycle drake et al 2018 raymond et al 2013 therefore understanding the spatiotemporal variations in oc transport across different rivers is significant riverine oc is divided into dissolved doc and particulate poc forms according to a particle size 0 45 μm or larger hope et al 1994 doc refers to carbon bound in various organic humic substances carbohydrates proteins viruses etc evans et al 2002 hope et al 1994 schulze 2005 poc mainly contains suspended phytoplankton and sediment compounded oc

al 2013 wang et al 2012 riverine oc transport is codetermined by various nature and human related factors which can be roughly categorized into six types ① temperature which is especially important for oc export from peat soils correll et al 2001 freeman et al 2002 tian et al 2013 ② water discharge containing evaporated water and precipitation correll et al 2001 liu et al 2020 ③ land cover especially wetland and or cropland areas correll et al 2001 tian et al 2013 ④ topographic features such as elevation and slope ludwig et al 1996 ⑤ the soil oc content freeman et al 2002 ludwig et al 1996 and ⑥ human activities e g sewage discharge and dam construction maavara et al 2017 regnier et al 2013 among them the temperature wetlands and croplands are usually reported to increase riverine oc correll et al 2001 freeman et al 2002 tian et al 2013 for seven u s coastal rivers tian et al 2013 reported that a one degree centigrade increase in air temperature would raise the riverine doc concentration by 0 476 mg l previous studies mainly focused on riverine oc export to estuaries based on field data oc loss from terrestrial ecosystems or model simulation riverine oc export to estuaries was estimated as 170 360 tg c yr of doc aitkenhead and mcdowell 2000 dai et al 2012b and 170 240 tg c yr of poc globally ludwig et al 1996 lyons et al 2002 the great uncertainties are ascribed to the spatiotemporal variations in riverine oc transport codetermined by natural and anthropogenic factors correll et al 2001 freeman et al 2002 regnier et al 2013 globally doc concentrations are usually high for arctic rivers but low for rivers at approximately 30 60 n dai et al 2012b poc contents are usually high in asian rivers liu et al 2020 ludwig et al 1996 however previous estimations mostly used seasonally in situ data collected in european and american rivers dai et al 2012b ludwig et al 1996 without long term field data previous studies only reported the spatial variations and or short term changes in oc transport in asian rivers huang et al 2017 ran et al 2013 wang et al 2012 moreover considerable attention was given to coastal rivers but information is limited for inland rivers huang et al 2012 ni et al 2008 therefore the long term oc transport features across different asian rivers remain unclear to better understand the global carbon cycle there is an urgent need to determine the spatiotemporal changes of oc transport in different asian rivers asian rivers are characterized by high poc but low doc contents i e typical doc poc ratios 1 0 liu et al 2020 ran et al 2013 of the oc exported to global estuaries approximately 34 of doc and 45 of poc are transported by asian rivers ludwig et al 1996 based on station based monitoring and watershed data during 2004 2018 this study clarified the spatial patterns temporal variations and driving forces of oc transport in 41 rivers across china the largest asian country the results are of great significance for understanding the global carbon cycle balancing the carbon budget in inland waters and managing river water quality 2 study areas china s landscape covers a wide spatial extent

quality has presented poor but gradual improvements over the past two decades tong et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 this study focuses on 41 considerably different rivers whose catchments have a mean digital elevation model dem of 132 65 4871 65 m an urban land area percent urbanper of 0 03 7 48 a mean annual normalized difference vegetation index ndvi of 0 13 0 72 a mean annual precipitation of 0

provinces except taiwan and cover approximately 36 of china s land area fig 1 3 materials and methods 3 1 weekly environmental data in china riverine doc is not routinely monitored instead chemical oxygen demand cod data are collected via the potassium permanganate method by the ministry of ecology and environment of china meec www mee gov cn cod has been widely adopted for assessing aquatic organic pollution by many government organizations over the past century and is found to be linearly related to doc contents in different water environments jiao et al 2021 meec 2002 due to unavailable long term in situ doc data across different rivers this study obtained weekly cod data during 2004 2018 from the meec a significant linear relationship was found for the match ups of doc and cod from 110 rivers in china and south korea supplementary fig s1 with r 2 0 55 and p 0 01 fig 2 a therefore this study used cod to indicate the relative doc content the weekly ammonia nitrogen nh 4 n concentration during 2004 2018 was also obtained from the meec based on the weekly data the mean cod and nh 4 n values at monthly and annual scales for different rivers were further calculated by the arithmetic averaging method supplementary fig s2 3 2 monthly hydrological data monthly hydrological data containing water discharge and suspended particulate matter spm fluxes for the 21 studied rivers during 2004 2018 fig 1 were sourced from the sediment communique of chinese rivers published by the ministry of water resources of china mwrc 2004 2018 for a specific river the hydrological station was spatially the same or close to the environmental monitoring site fig 1 after raw water was filtered nominal pore size of 0 45 μm the spm contents were determined via the gravimetric method by following the national standard of china gb 11901 89 using the monthly data we calculated the total annual spm flux and water discharge and then further calculated the mean annual spm concentration mg l by dividing the annual spm flux by the water discharge 3 3 calculating poc using the spm concentration without available poc data this study calculated the poc content from the in situ spm data section 3 2 compared to the european and american rivers chinese rivers usually have a high spm content and low water clarity ludwig et al 1996 ran et al 2013 which negatively impact phytoplankton growth as a result chinese rivers usually have a low algae content and poc is mainly sourced from suspended sediment moreover significant relationships between poc and spm have been reported for the three largest rivers in china the yellow yangtze and pearl rivers liu et al 2020 ni et al 2008 ran et al 2013 for the match ups of referenced poc and spm contents from 17 chinese rivers fig s1 a significant exponential relationship was also found fig 2b as shown in eq 1 1 lo g 10 poc 0 58 lo g 10 spm 0 82 n 197 r 2 0 81 p 0 01 for the studied rivers fig 1 eq 1 was adopted to calculate poc from the in situ spm concentration section 3 2 although eq 1 might not be highly robust for a specific river the results indicate the spatial pattern and long term changes of riverine poc transport 3

of statistics www stats gov cn 3 5 statistical methods independent sample t tests were adopted to determine whether the difference between two grouped samples was significant or not linear regressions were performed to explore the positive or negative impacts of various explanatory variables section 3 4 on the spatiotemporal variations in oc transport the linear relevance was denoted by pearson s r 1 0 1 0 with values close to 1 0 and 1 0 for strongly negative and positive relationships respectively in addition we quantitatively calculated the relative contributions of different factors to the riverine oc transport variations using the multiple general linear model glm based on the information theoretic approach and akaike information criteria the multiple glm method can reduce the model selection bias liu et al 2020 tong et al 2017 statistical significance was considered at p 0 05 two tailed test 4 results 4 1 spatial oc transport in different rivers riverine doc transport indicated by cod section 3 1 presented a spatial pattern of high in the north and low in the south excluding the highly polluted fen river with extremely high nh 4 n and cod values of 12 64 mg l and 58 91 mg l fig 1 table 1 respectively there was a positive linear relationship between the climatological mean cod and the latitude of the sampling sites with r 0 38 and p 0 05 fig 4 a the cod contents in rivers north of 30 n 5 39 3 66 mg l were significantly higher t test p 0 01 than those south of 30 n 2 39 1 14 mg l across different rivers the climatological mean cod ranged from 1 35 to 16 8 mg l with a mean std of 5 16 9 02 mg l table 1 moreover high cod contents were generally found for rivers influenced by strong human activities denoted by high urbanper in the catchments fig 4a the riverine poc concentration was generally high in the west and low in the east excluding the wei river flowing across the intensely eroded loess plateau china fig 1 table 1 the climatological mean poc was negatively related to the longitude of the sampling sites with r 0 42 and p 0 06 fig 4b the mean poc concentrations were 1 96 1 27 mg l and 1 34 1 19 mg l for rivers located west and east of 115 n respectively the climatological mean poc ranged from 0 27 to 4 48 mg l with a mean std of 1 69 1 27 mg l table 1 high poc contents were usually found in rivers that originated from highlands fig 4b for the liao river with high cropland coverage in the catchment 44 15 the poc concentration also reached as high as 4 48 mg l figs 3b 4b 4 2 annual and seasonal variations in oc transport although there was no obvious spatial pattern riverine doc transport indicated by cod showed an annual decrease in most rivers during 2004 2018 60 98 25 of 41 of the studied rivers showed cod decreases with 41

versa figs 4a 4c the cod concentrations in rivers with decreased and increased cod exhibited a noticeable difference with mean values of 4 67 3 62 mg l and 2 53 0 98 mg l respectively t test p 0 05 the highly organic polluted fen river table 1 had the most significant cod decrease during 2004 2018 with an annual decrease of 0 81 mg l p 0 01 being different from cod changes however urbanper in all catchments increased significantly fig 4c the mean annual poc concentrations in most rivers decreased during 2004 2018 of the studied rivers 90 48 19 of 21 showed poc decreases with 42 86 being significant fig 4d specifically the han river a tributary of the yangtze river fig 1 table 1 had the most significant poc decrease the mean poc concentration was 3 61 mg l in 2005 but only 1 36 mg l in 2018 with an approximately 60 decrease during 2004 2018 along with riverine poc decreases vegetation coverage indicated by ndvi increased in most regions especially in northeastern china and on the loess plateau figs 1 4d moreover for the two rivers with poc increases neng and upper yangtze rivers table 1 ndvi increases in corresponding catchments were negligible with r values of 0 07 and 0 06 p 0 05 respectively fig 4d both cod and poc transport also showed apparent seasonal variations across different rivers seasonal variations in cod transport were not similar the months with the highest cod contents were different fig s2 overall both monthly mean cod and nh 4 n in all studied rivers had higher values in winter than in summer fig 2c however the monthly mean poc in all rivers showed a unimodal distribution with the highest poc contents in summer fig s2 seasonal variations in poc transport were significantly determined by basin precipitation there was a significant linear relationship between monthly climatological poc and rainfall with r 0 96 and p 0 05 fig 2d 4 3 oc transport along the yellow and yangtze rivers oc transport along a specific river was spatially varied and the variations among different rivers were not consistent for three stations along the yellow river from upstream to downstream cod was highest at the midstream toudaoguai station 3 94 0 93 mg l and lowest at the upstream lanzhou station 2 83 0 38 mg l poc increased from 5 73 1 73 mg l to 24 52 9 15 mg l the cod poc ratio decreased from 0 53 0 13 to 0 14 0 17 fig 5 a c being different from the yellow river the cod concentrations at three stations along the yangtze river increased from upstream 2 06 0 28 mg l to downstream 2 37 0 36 mg l however poc and the cod poc ratio had the lowest 1 81 1 46 mg l and highest 1 77 1 14 values respectively at the midstream yichang station fig 5d f the spatial variations indicated that the river section selection would be important for estimating the oc flux e g carbon transported to the ocean oc transport at different sites along a specific river showed similar temporal variations for the yellow river both the cod and poc contents at different sites showed decreasing trends but the cod poc ratios increased during 2004 2018 fig 5 for the yangtze river the poc concentrations at different sites decreased significantly p 0 05 but the cod poc ratios increased apparently p 0 05 during 2004 2018 fig 5 the similar temporal features indicated that oc transport at different sites represented the changing trend for a specific river 5 discussion 5 1 driving forces of oc transport changes 5 1 1 spatial variations across different rivers 5 1 1 1 cod distributions human activities determined the spatial pattern of doc indicated by cod section 3 1 natural factors such as temperature lst soiltoc and precipitation have been reported to have significant influences on riverine doc transport aitkenhead and mcdowell 2000 correll et al 2001 tian et al 2013 but their contributions to the spatial distributions of cod in chinese rivers were small or negligible fig 6 a in contrast nh 4 n was significantly positively related to cod r 0 81 p 0 01 fig 6b and contributed 85 59 to its spatial variation fig 6a the nh 4 n contribution indicated the increasing effects of human activities on riverine doc drake et al 2018 regnier et al 2013 in china human activities increased the doc content mainly by discharging industrial and domestic organic matter into rivers globally human sewage carbon discharge is estimated to be 100 tg c yr most of which is in organic forms regnier et al 2013 by dividing the cod discharge 25 64 million tons by water usage 581 3 billion cubic meters in 2020 we obtained a high mean cod concentration of 44 12 mg l for wastewater in china http www stats gov cn in addition chinese rivers are commonly characterized by turbidity which adversely affects algal growth due to light limitation mwrc 2004 2018 wang et al 2012 moreover from the viewpoint of stoichiometry nh 4 n should not be the limiting nutrient for phytoplankton growth in chinese rivers across china the ratios of total nitrogen to total phosphorus tn tp were high 16 in most rivers 93 88 and had a mean value of 58 24 1 supplementary fig s3 considerably higher than the redfield ratio of 16 1 redfield 1958 high ratios of carbon to nitrogen c n in poc stoichiometry also indicate that poc is mostly terrigenous for the largest rivers i e yellow yangtze and pearl rivers ran et al 2013 wang et al 2012 wu et al 2007 5 1 1 2 poc distributions the spatial pattern of poc was codetermined by natural and anthropogenic factors the contributions of dem soiltoc ndvi lst and nh 4 n were 23 91 10 94 10 24 11 11 and 29 14 respectively fig 6a first high altitude catchments are prone to soil loss leading to high spm and sediment compounded poc contents in asian rivers ludwig et al 1996 lyons et al 2002 meybeck 1982 in china poc was significantly high in western rivers with a high dem r 0 68 p 0 05 figs 4b 6c second vegetation coverage indicated by ndvi can reduce soil erosion correll et al 2001 hope et al 1994 and low temperature will increase soiltoc by reducing oc decomposition by microorganisms sierra et al 2015 therefore ndvi and lst also impacted the poc distributions fig 6a basin ndvi was significantly negatively correlated with the poc concentration with r 0 55 and p 0 05 fig 6d third algal proliferation along with high nh 4 n can increase autochthonous poc production jiang et al 2015 liu et al 2019c dam construction would also greatly change riverine poc distributions low flow velocity in reservoirs favors suspended particle deposition reported as the main reason for the decrease in riverine sediment poc transport to estuaries globally chu et al 2009 liu et al 2020 maavara et al 2017 with respect to the largest reservoirs along the yellow and yangtze rivers xiaolangdi and three gorges dam tgd the poc upstream was 1 86 and 1 31 times that in these respective reservoirs during march june 2021 supplementary figs s4a b these reservoirs retained approximately 38 66 and 19 63 respectively of the upstream input of poc figs s4a b moreover there were exponentially positive relationships p 0 01 between the poc retention rates and upstream input of poc concentrations figs s4c d 5 1 2 temporal variations during 2004 2018 oc transport in all studied chinese rivers showed noticeably annual and seasonal variations section 4 2 which have been reported for the largest rivers e g the yellow yangtze and pearl rivers ni et al 2008 wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 using multiple glm analysis section 3 5 we also quantified the relative contributions of nh 4 n ndvi precipitation lst and urbanper to the temporal annual and monthly variations in riverine cod and poc concentrations during 2004 2018 as shown in fig 7 cod changes were mainly influenced by anthropogenic factors nh 4 n and urbanper and poc variations were primarily impacted by natural factors ndvi and precipitation 5 1 2 1 cod transport human activities indicated by urbanper determined the annual cod changes the urbanper contributions to the temporal cod variations had a mean value of 38 7 and were significant for 63 41 of the rivers fig 7a on the one hand water pollution prevention and control strategies implemented by the chinese government have improved inland water quality since 2000 tong et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 as a result 60 98 of the studied rivers with initially high cod values 2 5 mg l showed cod decreases table 1 fig 4c on the other hand increasing sewage discharge with intensifying human activities 48 24 and 7 5 billion tons in 2004 and 2018 respectively supplementary fig s5a also increased the cod contents in some rivers especially those with low cod contents table 1 fig 7a anthropogenic pollution indicated by nh 4 n had apparent influences on seasonal cod changes the nh 4 n contribution to the temporal cod variations had a mean value of 18 07 and was significant for 15 rivers fig 7a the nh 4 n concentrations in chinese rivers usually change seasonally zhou et al 2017 along with nh 4 n variations human activities seasonally change allochthonous and autochthonous doc contents by discharging water sewage and stimulating phytoplankton growth respectively regnier et al 2013 tranvik et al 2009 nh 4 n is an essential factor that determines the succession of algal species and cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater systems dai et al 2012a 5 1 2 2 poc transport vegetation restoration and dam construction reduced riverine poc transport during 2004 2018 for the upper yellow and yangtze rivers with low vegetation coverage chen et al 2019 increased ndvi contributed significantly to the poc decreases figs 4d 7b owing to vegetation restoration engineering projects such as the grain for green program vegetation coverage has increased over the past two decades across china chen et al 2019 playing an essential role in decreasing the riverine poc content fig 7b in addition dam construction should also contribute to the poc decreases in china both the total reservoir number 85160 in 2004 and 98822 in 2018 and capacity 554 2 and 895 3 billion cubic meters in 2004 and 2018 respectively increased during 2004 2018 supplementary fig s5b for the major chinese rivers entering the oceans dam construction explained 56 of the sediment reductions during 1959 2007 chu et al 2009 and 69 31 of the poc decreases during 1953 2016 liu et al 2020 specifically poc burial in reservoirs in 2030 2 06 tg c yr is projected to be 4 38 times that in 2000 0 47 tg c yr for the largest river basin yangtze river basin maavara et al 2017 precipitation determined the seasonal poc variations precipitation significantly impacted seasonal poc variations in 90 of the rivers fig 7b under the influence of the east asian monsoon rainfall in china is high in summer but low in winter wu et al 2021 which leads to high riverine poc transport in the rainy season section 4 2 although maximum values occur in different months high poc concentrations in summer have been reported for the four largest chinese rivers entering estuaries i e the songhua yellow yangtze and pearl rivers ni et al 2008 wang et al 2012 wu et al 2007 zhang et al 2014 5 2 chinese rivers are losing the asian features of oc transport 5 2 1 doc poc ratio asian rivers have been reported to have low doc poc ratios huang et al 2012 ludwig et al 1996 ran et al 2013 ludwig et al 1996 reported a mean doc poc ratio of 0 9 for asian rivers entering estuaries but approximately 1 4 for other rivers worldwide the mean doc poc ratio is 1 04 for all tropical rivers between 30 n and 30 s globally but only 0 75 for those in asia huang et al 2012 specifically the doc poc ratio was as high as 8 67 in the north american columbia river ludwig et al 1996 however for the chinese yellow yangtze and pearl rivers the doc poc ratios near the estuaries were only 0 15 0 41 and 0 23 respectively ran et al 2013 wu et al 2007 a low doc poc ratio of 0 47 was also previously reported for rivers in southern china huang et al 2017 in general the doc poc ratio exponentially decreases with increasing sediment yield for global rivers pouring into estuaries liu et al 2020 ran et al 2013 despite the low values the doc poc ratios of chinese rivers mostly showed increasing trends along with annual cod and poc changes section 4 2 90 48 of the studied rivers showed increasing cod poc ratios during 2004 2018 with 52 38 being significant table 1 for chinese rivers entering estuaries together liu et al 2020 reported an exponential increase in the doc poc ratio during 1953 2016 to be specific as shown in fig 8 a the doc poc ratios of the large liao and pearl rivers increased greatly to the global mean value of 1 18 ludwig et al 1996 increases in the doc poc ratios might also occur in other asian rivers for 55 rivers in southeastern asia huang et al 2017 reported a mean doc poc ratio of 1 56 similar to that of european and american rivers ludwig et al 1996 dam construction is an important reason for the increases in riverine doc poc ratios through a reduction in poc and or an increase in doc liu et al 2020 maavara et al 2017 5 2 2 poc spm asian rivers have also been reported to have a low poc weight percentage relative to spm poc spm for global rivers entering estuaries poc spm decreased with increasing spm contents according to a cubic equation ludwig et al 1996 for the yangtze river an exponentially negative relationship between poc spm and spm was reported moreover for a specific spm concentration poc spm was lower than the global curve zhang et al 2014 using published in situ poc and spm data liu et al 2020 ni et al 2008 ran et al 2013 sun et al 2017 wang et al 2012 we also found an exponential relationship between poc spm and spm for chinese rivers entering estuaries however poc spm was lower than the global curve only when with spm 100 mg l fig 8b following an exponentially negative curve fig 8b chinese rivers exhibited increasing poc spm with decreasing spm transport over the past decades chu et al 2009 liu et al 2020 there are three possible explanations first riverine spm contents decreased due to human activities such as dam construction soil conservation and sand mining chu et al 2009 dai et al 2009 second sediment deposition that mainly occurs with large particles within reservoir areas would also increase poc spm zhang et al 2014 third human induced water eutrophication will increase phytoplankton related poc with high poc spm which often happens in urban rivers zhang et al 2015 5 3 implications for the global carbon cycle inland waters rivers reservoirs and lakes serve as regulators of the global carbon cycle globally inland waters receive 5100 tg c yr from the land ecosystem deposit 600 tg c yr in the sediment release 3900 tg c yr of co2 and 103 tg c yr of ch4 to the atmosphere and discharge 900 tg c yr to estuaries drake et al 2018 in total the greenhouse effect of inland waters can offset approximately 80 of the land carbon sink bastviken et al 2011 specially rivers account for approximately 85 of the total co2 emissions of inland waters raymond et al 2013 however due to climate change and human activities the river contribution is spatiotemporally changing with 93 19 in the 1980s and 87 55 in the 2010s for all chinese rivers ran et al 2013 raymond et al 2013 according to the above findings this study has some implications for the riverine carbon cycle and export to estuaries 5 3 1 carbon cycle in rivers concentrations of organic and inorganic carbon and nutrients in rivers are interrelated phytoplankton proliferation will consume inorganic carbon and nutrients to produce doc and poc through photosynthesis drake et al 2018 tian et al 2015a 2015b tranvik et al 2009 and riverine oc will decompose into inorganic carbon and nutrients through microbial mineralization maavara et al 2017 nakayama et al 2022 tian et al 2015b it is reported that the mineralization of increased riverine oc is an important reason for the increasing co2 emissions from tibetan plateau rivers ran et al 2021 in addition to co2 riverine oc also fuels the emissions of greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide borges et al 2015 tian et al 2015b high co2 and methane but low nitrous oxide emissions were reported for oc rich african rivers discharged from catchments with large wetland extents borges et al 2015 more attention should be given to quantifying the changes in riverine oc storage under the influence of global change first similar to china oc contents in global rivers are changing increased leaching of doc from peatland and or permafrost due to global warming is frequently reported freeman et al 2002 guo et al 2007 second dam construction can significantly increase riverine oc storage along with dam impounding a large amount of riverine oc will be retained in a reservoir moreover reservoir eutrophication can further increase oc storage song et al 2018 third riverine carbon burial is also spatially changing dam construction can greatly increase poc burial in reservoirs drake et al 2018 maavara et al 2017 regnier et al 2013 along with the ongoing boom in dam construction maavara et al 2017 projected a reservoir poc burial amount of 4 28 tg c yr in 2030 compared with 2 18 tg c yr in 2000 however increasing carbon retention in reservoirs would lead to a decreased poc content and sediment poc erosion downstream liu et al 2020 regnier et al 2013 after the completion of the three gorges dam the poc content in the lower yangtze river has significantly decreased moreover the riverbed has shifted from a poc sediment sink to a source dai and liu 2013 liu et al 2019a 2019b 5 3 2 riverine oc export to estuaries and oceans riverine oc export to estuaries is ecologically important and has been studied extensively liu et al 2020 wang et al 2012 but the estimations have large uncertainties dai et al 2012b ludwig et al 1996 meybeck 1982 the recently reported values are 170 360 tg c yr of doc and 170 240 tg c yr of poc supplementary table s3 the uncertainties are partly related to the highly temporal variations in riverine oc transport section 4 2 under the impacts of natural and human activities liu et al 2020 regnier et al 2013 in addition due to the spatial variations section 4 3 monitoring sites are also essential for estimating riverine oc export to estuaries previous studies used data collected near the sea land interface without a consistent standard dai et al 2012b huang et al 2012 tian et al 2013 which might be another reason for the estimation uncertainties table s3 in the yangtze river both in situ doc and poc concentrations showed increasing trends from upstream to downstream with ranges of 0 26 1 98 mg l and 0 19 1 34 mg l respectively figs 8c d therefore the representativeness of both sampling sites and monitoring time should be considered to reduce uncertainties oc export to estuaries is different from that to oceans regnier et al 2013 riverine oc would largely be removed in estuaries through photooxidation sedimentation flocculation and microbial respiration processes consequently only some terrestrial oc is further transported to oceans bauer et al 2013 regnier et al 2013 moreover the composition changes of riverine oc determine the transport distance taking the east china sea for example most riverine poc is deposited in nearshore estuarine waters deng et al 2006 in contrast riverine doc can diffuse over a relatively long distance bai et al 2013 in other words the oc composition changes in chinese rivers section 4 will influence the riverine carbon export to the oceans 6 conclusions in china human activities greatly changed the spatiotemporal variations of riverine oc transport during 2004 2018 anthropogenic sewage discharge indicated by nh 4 n was positively related to the riverine doc content r 0 81 p 0 01 and explained 85 59 of its spatial variation during 2004 2018 water pollution prevention and control strategies decreased doc in 60 98 of rivers meanwhile anthropogenic vegetation restoration and dam construction led to poc decreases in 90 48 of rivers as a result of artificial disturbance chinese rivers are losing their asian features of low doc poc and poc spm increasing doc poc ratios were found in 90 48 of rivers with 42 86 being significant organic and inorganic carbon cycles in rivers are

15646,rivers serve as regulators of global climate by releasing greenhouse gases burying particulate carbon and connecting different ecosystem carbon pools however long term organic carbon oc transport features across different asian rivers are not well known due to unavailable data based on routinely monitored environmental and hydrological data during 2004 2018 this study investigated the spatiotemporal variations in dissolved doc and particulate oc poc transport across 41 rivers in china across different rivers both doc 1 35 16 8 mg l and poc 0 27 4 48 mg l concentrations covered wide ranges the doc content was high in the north and low in the south with significantly higher t test p 0 01 values for rivers north of 30 n 5 39 3 66 mg l vs 2 39 1 14 mg l human activities greatly influenced the riverine doc and poc distributions the riverine ammonia nitrogen nh 4 n content was positively correlated with doc r 0 81 and p 0 01 and explained 85 59 of its spatial variation high vegetation coverage had significant effects on decreasing the riverine poc content with r 0 55 and p 0 05 during 2004 2018 water pollution prevention and control strategies decreased doc concentrations in 60 98 of rivers meanwhile anthropogenic vegetation restoration and dam construction led to poc content decreases in 90 48 of rivers importantly along with doc and poc changes increasing doc poc ratios were found in 90 48 of the rivers with 42 86 being significant which indicated that chinese rivers are losing their asian features of low doc poc ratios due to artificial disturbance this study is significant for accurately quantifying greenhouse gas emissions carbon burial and oc export to estuaries by chinese rivers graphical abstract image graphical abstract

connecting the carbon pools of the land lake and ocean ecosystems maavara et al 2017 tranvik et al 2009 wang et al 2012 annually global rivers transport approximately 5100 tg c yr 70 of net land carbon sink 1 tg 1012 g from the land to inland waters and then further pour 900 tg c yr into estuaries drake et al 2018 riverine carbon transport from highland to lowland areas is nonreversible and records the natural processes and human activities in catchments liu et al 2020 ludwig et al 1996 maavara et al 2017 however the organic carbon oc proportions in different rivers are still unknown and have latitudinal differences tranvik et al 2009 moreover the oc related matter will deteriorate water quality by consuming dissolved oxygen through aerobic decomposition liu et al 2020 tranvik et al 2009 influence phytoplankton growth by absorbing light liu et al 2020 and regulate the global carbon cycle drake et al 2018 raymond et al 2013 therefore understanding the spatiotemporal variations in oc transport across different rivers is significant riverine oc is divided into dissolved doc and particulate poc forms according to a particle size 0 45 μm or larger hope et al 1994 doc refers to carbon bound in various organic humic substances carbohydrates proteins viruses etc evans et al 2002 hope et al 1994 schulze 2005 poc mainly contains suspended phytoplankton and sediment compounded oc

al 2013 wang et al 2012 riverine oc transport is codetermined by various nature and human related factors which can be roughly categorized into six types ① temperature which is especially important for oc export from peat soils correll et al 2001 freeman et al 2002 tian et al 2013 ② water discharge containing evaporated water and precipitation correll et al 2001 liu et al 2020 ③ land cover especially wetland and or cropland areas correll et al 2001 tian et al 2013 ④ topographic features such as elevation and slope ludwig et al 1996 ⑤ the soil oc content freeman et al 2002 ludwig et al 1996 and ⑥ human activities e g sewage discharge and dam construction maavara et al 2017 regnier et al 2013 among them the temperature wetlands and croplands are usually reported to increase riverine oc correll et al 2001 freeman et al 2002 tian et al 2013 for seven u s coastal rivers tian et al 2013 reported that a one degree centigrade increase in air temperature would raise the riverine doc concentration by 0 476 mg l previous studies mainly focused on riverine oc export to estuaries based on field data oc loss from terrestrial ecosystems or model simulation riverine oc export to estuaries was estimated as 170 360 tg c yr of doc aitkenhead and mcdowell 2000 dai et al 2012b and 170 240 tg c yr of poc globally ludwig et al 1996 lyons et al 2002 the great uncertainties are ascribed to the spatiotemporal variations in riverine oc transport codetermined by natural and anthropogenic factors correll et al 2001 freeman et al 2002 regnier et al 2013 globally doc concentrations are usually high for arctic rivers but low for rivers at approximately 30 60 n dai et al 2012b poc contents are usually high in asian rivers liu et al 2020 ludwig et al 1996 however previous estimations mostly used seasonally in situ data collected in european and american rivers dai et al 2012b ludwig et al 1996 without long term field data previous studies only reported the spatial variations and or short term changes in oc transport in asian rivers huang et al 2017 ran et al 2013 wang et al 2012 moreover considerable attention was given to coastal rivers but information is limited for inland rivers huang et al 2012 ni et al 2008 therefore the long term oc transport features across different asian rivers remain unclear to better understand the global carbon cycle there is an urgent need to determine the spatiotemporal changes of oc transport in different asian rivers asian rivers are characterized by high poc but low doc contents i e typical doc poc ratios 1 0 liu et al 2020 ran et al 2013 of the oc exported to global estuaries approximately 34 of doc and 45 of poc are transported by asian rivers ludwig et al 1996 based on station based monitoring and

organic pollution by many government organizations over the past century and is found to be linearly related to doc contents in different water environments jiao et al 2021 meec 2002 due to unavailable long term in situ doc data across different rivers this study obtained weekly cod data during 2004 2018 from the meec a significant linear relationship was found for the match ups of doc and cod from 110 rivers in china and south korea supplementary fig s1 with r 2 0 55 and p 0 01 fig 2 a therefore this study used cod to indicate the relative doc content the weekly ammonia nitrogen nh 4 n concentration during 2004 2018 was also obtained from the meec based on the weekly data the mean cod and nh 4 n values at monthly and annual scales for different rivers were further calculated by the arithmetic averaging method supplementary fig s2 3 2 monthly hydrological data monthly hydrological data containing water discharge and suspended particulate matter spm fluxes for the 21 studied rivers during 2004 2018 fig 1 were sourced from the sediment communique of chinese rivers published by the ministry of water resources of china mwrc 2004 2018 for a specific river the hydrological station was spatially the same or close to the environmental monitoring site fig 1 after raw water was filtered nominal pore size of 0 45 μm the spm contents were determined via the gravimetric method by following the national standard of china gb 11901 89 using the monthly data we calculated the total annual spm flux and water discharge and then further calculated the mean annual spm concentration mg l by dividing the annual spm flux by the water discharge 3 3 calculating poc using the spm concentration without available poc data this study calculated the poc content from the in situ spm data section 3 2 compared to the european and american rivers chinese rivers usually have a high spm content and low water clarity ludwig et al 1996 ran et al 2013 which negatively impact phytoplankton growth as a result chinese rivers usually have a low algae content and poc is mainly sourced from suspended sediment moreover significant relationships between poc and spm have been reported for the three largest rivers in china the yellow yangtze and pearl rivers liu et al 2020 ni et al 2008 ran et al 2013 for the match ups of referenced poc and spm contents from 17 chinese rivers fig s1 a significant exponential relationship was also found fig 2b as shown in eq 1 1 lo g 10 poc 0 58 lo g 10 spm 0 82 n 197 r 2 0 81 p 0 01 for the studied rivers fig 1 eq 1 was adopted to calculate poc from the in situ spm concentration section 3 2 although eq 1 might not be highly robust for a specific river the results indicate the spatial pattern and long term changes of riverine poc transport 3 4 multisource watershed datasets six datasets of catchment characteristics ① ⑥ were obtained to quantitatively explain the spatiotemporal variations in riverine oc transport ① ③ are the monthly mean

of statistics www stats gov cn 3 5 statistical methods independent sample t tests were adopted to determine whether the difference between two grouped samples was significant or not linear regressions were performed to explore the positive or negative impacts of various explanatory variables section 3 4 on the spatiotemporal variations in oc transport the linear relevance was denoted by pearson s r 1 0 1 0 with values close to 1 0 and 1 0 for strongly negative and positive relationships respectively in addition we quantitatively calculated the relative contributions of different factors to the riverine oc transport variations using the multiple general linear model glm based on the information theoretic approach and akaike information criteria the multiple glm method can reduce the model selection bias liu et al 2020 tong et al 2017 statistical significance was considered at p 0 05 two tailed test 4 results 4 1 spatial oc transport in different rivers riverine doc transport indicated by cod section 3 1 presented a spatial pattern of high in the north and low in the south excluding the highly polluted fen river with extremely high nh 4 n and cod values of 12 64 mg l and 58 91 mg l fig 1 table 1 respectively there was a positive linear relationship between the climatological mean cod and the latitude of the sampling sites with r 0 38 and p 0 05 fig 4 a the cod contents in rivers north of 30 n 5 39 3 66 mg l were significantly higher t test p 0 01 than those south of 30 n 2 39 1 14 mg l across different rivers the climatological mean cod ranged from 1 35 to 16 8 mg l with a mean std of 5 16 9 02 mg l table 1 moreover high cod contents were generally found for rivers influenced by strong human activities denoted by high urbanper in the catchments fig 4a the riverine poc concentration was generally high in the west and low in the east excluding the wei river flowing across the intensely eroded loess plateau china fig 1 table 1 the climatological mean poc was negatively related to the longitude of the sampling sites with r 0 42 and p 0 06 fig 4b the mean poc concentrations were 1 96 1 27 mg l and 1 34 1 19 mg l for rivers located west and east of 115 n respectively the climatological mean poc ranged from 0 27 to 4 48 mg l with a mean std of 1 69 1 27 mg l table 1 high poc contents were usually found in rivers that originated from highlands fig 4b for the liao river with high cropland coverage in the catchment 44 15 the poc concentration also reached as high as 4 48 mg l figs 3b 4b 4 2 annual and seasonal variations in oc transport although there was no obvious spatial pattern riverine doc transport indicated by cod showed an annual decrease in most rivers during 2004 2018 60 98 25 of 41 of the studied rivers showed cod decreases with 41 46 being significant in contrast 39 02 of the rivers showed cod increases with only 21 95 being significant fig 4c interestingly cod decreased mainly in rivers with high cod concentrations and vice versa figs 4a 4c the cod concentrations in rivers with decreased and increased cod exhibited a noticeable difference with mean values of 4 67 3 62 mg l and 2 53 0 98 mg l respectively t test p 0 05 the highly organic polluted fen river table 1 had the most significant cod decrease during 2004 2018 with an annual decrease of 0 81 mg l p 0 01 being different from cod changes however urbanper in all catchments increased significantly fig 4c the mean annual poc concentrations in most rivers decreased during 2004 2018 of the studied rivers 90 48 19 of 21 showed poc decreases with 42 86 being significant fig 4d specifically the han river a tributary of the yangtze river fig 1 table 1 had the most significant poc decrease the mean poc concentration was 3 61 mg l in 2005 but only 1 36 mg l in 2018 with an approximately 60 decrease during 2004 2018 along with riverine poc decreases vegetation coverage indicated by ndvi increased in most regions especially in northeastern china and on the loess plateau figs 1 4d moreover for the two rivers with poc increases neng and upper yangtze rivers table 1 ndvi increases in corresponding catchments were negligible with r values of 0 07 and 0 06 p 0 05 respectively fig 4d both cod and poc transport also showed apparent seasonal variations across different rivers seasonal variations in cod transport were not similar the months with the highest cod contents were different fig s2 overall both monthly mean cod and nh 4 n in all studied rivers had higher values in winter than in summer fig 2c however the monthly mean poc in all rivers showed a unimodal distribution with the highest poc contents in summer fig s2 seasonal variations in poc transport were significantly determined by basin precipitation there was a significant linear relationship between monthly climatological poc and rainfall with r 0 96 and p 0 05 fig 2d 4 3 oc transport along the yellow and yangtze rivers oc transport along a specific river was spatially varied and the variations among different rivers were not consistent for three stations along the yellow river from upstream to downstream cod was highest at the midstream toudaoguai station 3 94 0 93 mg l and lowest at the upstream lanzhou station 2 83 0 38 mg l poc increased from 5 73 1 73 mg l to 24 52 9 15 mg l the cod poc ratio decreased from 0 53 0 13 to 0 14 0 17 fig 5 a c being different from the yellow river the cod concentrations at three stations along the yangtze river increased from upstream 2 06 0 28 mg l to downstream 2 37 0 36 mg l however poc and the cod poc ratio had the lowest 1 81 1 46 mg l and highest 1 77 1 14 values respectively at the midstream yichang station fig 5d f the spatial variations indicated that the river section selection would be important for estimating the oc flux e g carbon transported to the ocean oc transport at different sites along a specific river showed similar temporal variations for the yellow river both the cod and poc contents at different sites showed decreasing trends but the cod poc ratios increased during 2004 2018 fig 5 for the yangtze river the poc concentrations at different sites decreased significantly p 0 05 but the cod poc ratios increased apparently p 0 05 during 2004 2018 fig 5 the similar temporal features indicated that oc transport at different sites represented the changing trend for a specific river 5 discussion 5 1 driving forces of oc transport changes 5 1 1 spatial variations across different rivers 5 1 1 1 cod distributions human activities determined the spatial pattern of doc indicated by cod section 3 1 natural factors such as temperature lst soiltoc and precipitation have been reported to have significant influences on riverine doc transport aitkenhead and mcdowell 2000 correll et al 2001 tian et al 2013 but their contributions to the spatial distributions of cod in chinese rivers were small or negligible fig 6 a in contrast nh 4 n was significantly positively related to cod r 0 81 p 0 01 fig 6b and contributed 85 59 to its spatial variation fig 6a the nh 4 n contribution indicated the increasing effects of human activities on riverine doc drake et al 2018 regnier et al 2013 in china human activities increased the doc content mainly by discharging industrial and domestic organic matter into rivers globally human sewage carbon discharge is estimated to be 100 tg c yr most of which is in organic forms regnier et al 2013 by dividing the cod discharge 25 64 million tons by water usage 581 3 billion cubic meters in 2020 we obtained a high mean cod concentration of 44 12 mg l for wastewater in china http www stats gov cn in addition chinese rivers are commonly characterized by turbidity which adversely affects algal growth due to light limitation mwrc 2004 2018 wang et al 2012 moreover from the viewpoint of stoichiometry nh 4 n should not be the limiting nutrient for phytoplankton growth in chinese rivers across china the ratios of total nitrogen to total phosphorus tn tp were high 16 in most rivers 93 88 and had a mean value of 58 24 1 supplementary fig s3 considerably higher than the redfield ratio of 16 1 redfield 1958 high ratios of carbon to nitrogen c n in poc stoichiometry also indicate that poc is mostly terrigenous for the largest rivers i e yellow yangtze and pearl rivers ran et al 2013 wang et al 2012 wu et al 2007 5 1 1 2 poc distributions the spatial pattern of poc was codetermined by natural and anthropogenic factors the contributions of dem soiltoc ndvi lst and nh 4 n were 23 91 10 94 10 24 11 11 and 29 14 respectively fig 6a first high altitude catchments are prone to soil loss leading to high spm and sediment compounded poc contents in asian rivers ludwig et al 1996 lyons et al 2002 meybeck 1982 in china poc was significantly high in western rivers with a high dem r 0 68 p 0 05 figs 4b 6c second vegetation coverage indicated by ndvi can reduce soil erosion correll et al 2001 hope et al 1994 and low temperature will increase soiltoc by reducing oc decomposition by microorganisms sierra et al 2015 therefore ndvi and lst also impacted the poc distributions fig 6a basin ndvi was significantly negatively correlated with the poc concentration with r 0 55 and p 0 05 fig 6d third algal proliferation along with high nh 4 n can increase autochthonous poc production jiang et al 2015 liu et al 2019c dam construction would also greatly change riverine poc distributions low flow velocity in reservoirs favors suspended particle deposition reported as the main reason for the decrease in riverine sediment poc transport to estuaries globally chu et al 2009 liu et al 2020 maavara et al 2017 with respect to the largest reservoirs along the yellow and yangtze rivers xiaolangdi and three gorges dam tgd the poc upstream was 1 86 and 1 31 times that in these respective reservoirs during march june 2021 supplementary figs s4a b these reservoirs retained approximately 38 66 and 19 63 respectively of the upstream input of poc figs s4a b moreover there were exponentially positive relationships p 0 01 between the poc retention rates and upstream input of poc concentrations figs s4c d 5 1 2 temporal variations during 2004 2018 oc transport in all studied chinese rivers showed noticeably annual and seasonal variations section 4 2 which have been reported for the largest rivers e g the yellow yangtze and pearl rivers ni et al 2008 wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 using multiple glm analysis section 3 5 we also quantified the relative contributions of nh 4 n ndvi precipitation lst and urbanper to the temporal annual and monthly variations in riverine cod and poc concentrations during 2004 2018 as shown in fig 7 cod changes were mainly influenced by anthropogenic factors nh 4 n and urbanper and poc variations were primarily impacted by natural factors ndvi and precipitation 5 1 2 1 cod transport human activities indicated by urbanper determined the annual cod changes the urbanper contributions to the temporal cod variations had a mean value of 38 7 and were significant for 63 41 of the rivers fig 7a on the one hand water pollution prevention and control strategies implemented by the chinese government have improved inland water quality since 2000 tong et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 as a result 60 98 of the studied rivers with initially high cod values 2 5 mg l showed cod decreases table 1 fig 4c on the other hand increasing sewage discharge with intensifying human activities 48 24 and 7 5 billion tons in 2004 and 2018 respectively supplementary fig s5a also increased the cod contents in some rivers especially those with low cod contents table 1 fig 7a anthropogenic pollution indicated by nh 4 n had apparent influences on seasonal cod changes the nh 4 n contribution to the temporal cod variations had a mean value of 18 07 and was significant for 15 rivers fig 7a the nh 4 n concentrations in chinese rivers usually change seasonally zhou et al 2017 along with nh 4 n variations human activities seasonally change allochthonous and autochthonous doc contents by discharging water sewage and stimulating phytoplankton growth respectively regnier et al 2013 tranvik et al 2009 nh 4 n is an essential factor that determines the succession of algal species and cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater systems dai et al 2012a 5 1 2 2 poc transport vegetation restoration and dam construction reduced riverine poc transport during 2004 2018 for the upper yellow and yangtze rivers with low vegetation coverage chen et al 2019 increased ndvi contributed significantly to the poc decreases figs 4d 7b owing to vegetation restoration engineering projects such as the grain for green program vegetation coverage has increased over the past two decades across china chen et al 2019 playing an essential role in decreasing the riverine poc content fig 7b in addition dam construction should also contribute to the poc decreases in china both the total reservoir number 85160 in 2004 and 98822 in 2018 and capacity 554 2 and 895 3 billion cubic meters in 2004 and 2018 respectively increased during 2004 2018 supplementary fig s5b for the major chinese rivers entering the oceans dam construction explained 56 of the sediment reductions during 1959 2007 chu et al 2009 and 69 31 of the poc decreases during 1953 2016 liu et al 2020 specifically poc burial in reservoirs in 2030 2 06 tg c yr is projected to be 4 38 times that in 2000 0 47 tg c yr for the largest river basin yangtze river basin maavara et al 2017 precipitation determined the seasonal poc variations precipitation significantly impacted seasonal poc variations in 90 of the rivers fig 7b under the influence of the east asian monsoon rainfall in china is high in summer but low in winter wu et al 2021 which leads to high riverine poc transport in the rainy season section 4 2 although maximum values occur in different months high poc concentrations in summer have been reported for the four largest chinese rivers entering estuaries i e the songhua yellow yangtze and pearl rivers ni et al 2008 wang et al 2012 wu et al 2007 zhang et al 2014 5 2 chinese rivers are losing the asian features of oc transport 5 2 1 doc poc ratio asian rivers have been reported to have low doc poc ratios huang et al 2012 ludwig et al 1996 ran et al 2013 ludwig et al 1996 reported a mean doc poc ratio of 0 9 for asian rivers entering estuaries but approximately 1 4 for other rivers worldwide the mean doc poc ratio is 1 04 for all tropical rivers between 30 n and 30 s globally but only 0 75 for those in asia huang et al 2012 specifically the doc poc ratio was as high as 8 67 in the north american columbia river ludwig et al 1996 however for the chinese yellow yangtze and pearl rivers the doc poc ratios near the estuaries were only 0 15 0 41 and 0 23 respectively ran et al 2013 wu et al 2007 a low doc poc ratio of 0 47 was also previously reported for rivers in southern china huang et al 2017 in general the doc poc ratio exponentially decreases with increasing sediment yield for global rivers pouring into estuaries liu et al 2020 ran et al 2013 despite the low values the doc poc ratios of chinese rivers mostly showed increasing trends along with annual cod and poc changes section 4 2 90 48 of the studied rivers showed increasing cod poc ratios during 2004 2018 with 52 38 being significant table 1 for chinese rivers entering estuaries together liu et al 2020 reported an exponential increase in the doc poc ratio during 1953 2016 to be specific as shown in fig 8 a the doc poc ratios of the large liao and pearl rivers increased greatly to the global mean value of 1 18 ludwig et al 1996 increases in the doc poc ratios might also occur in other asian rivers for 55 rivers in southeastern asia huang et al 2017 reported a mean doc poc ratio of 1 56 similar to that of european and american rivers ludwig et al 1996 dam construction is an important reason for the increases in riverine doc poc ratios through a reduction in poc and or an increase in doc liu et al 2020 maavara et al 2017 5 2 2 poc spm asian rivers have also been reported to have a low poc weight percentage relative to spm poc spm for global rivers entering estuaries poc spm decreased with increasing spm contents according to a cubic equation ludwig et al 1996 for the yangtze river an exponentially negative relationship between poc spm and spm was reported moreover for a specific spm concentration poc spm was lower than the global curve zhang et al 2014 using published in situ poc and spm data liu et al 2020 ni et al 2008 ran et al 2013 sun et al 2017 wang et al 2012 we also found an exponential relationship between poc spm and spm for chinese rivers entering estuaries however poc spm was lower than the global curve only when with spm 100 mg l fig 8b following an exponentially negative curve fig 8b chinese rivers exhibited increasing poc spm with decreasing spm transport over the past decades chu et al 2009 liu et al 2020 there are three possible explanations first riverine spm contents decreased due to human activities such as dam construction soil conservation and sand mining chu et al 2009 dai et al 2009 second sediment deposition that mainly occurs with large particles within reservoir areas would also increase poc spm zhang et al 2014 third human induced water eutrophication will increase phytoplankton related poc with high poc spm which often happens in urban rivers zhang et al 2015 5 3 implications for the global carbon cycle inland waters rivers reservoirs and lakes serve as regulators of the global carbon cycle globally inland waters receive 5100 tg c yr from the land ecosystem deposit 600 tg c yr in the sediment release 3900 tg c yr of co2 and 103 tg c yr of ch4 to the atmosphere and discharge 900 tg c yr to estuaries drake et al 2018 in total the greenhouse effect of inland waters can offset approximately 80 of the land carbon sink bastviken et al 2011 specially rivers account for approximately 85 of the total co2 emissions of inland waters raymond et al 2013 however due to climate change and human activities the river contribution is spatiotemporally changing with 93 19 in the 1980s and 87 55 in the 2010s for all chinese rivers ran et al 2013 raymond et al 2013 according to the above findings this study has some implications for the riverine carbon cycle and export to estuaries 5 3 1 carbon cycle in rivers concentrations of organic and inorganic carbon and nutrients in rivers are interrelated phytoplankton proliferation will consume inorganic carbon and nutrients to produce doc and poc through photosynthesis drake et al 2018 tian et al 2015a 2015b tranvik et al 2009 and riverine oc will decompose into inorganic carbon and nutrients through microbial mineralization maavara et al 2017 nakayama et al 2022 tian et al 2015b it is reported that the mineralization of increased riverine oc is an important reason for the increasing co2 emissions from tibetan plateau rivers ran et al 2021 in addition to co2 riverine oc also fuels the emissions of greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide borges et al 2015 tian et al 2015b high co2 and methane but low nitrous oxide emissions were reported for oc rich african rivers discharged from catchments with large wetland extents borges et al 2015 more attention should be given to quantifying the changes in riverine oc storage under the influence of global change first similar to china oc contents in global rivers are changing increased leaching of doc from peatland and or permafrost due to global warming is frequently reported freeman et al 2002 guo et al 2007 second dam construction can significantly increase riverine oc storage along with dam impounding a large amount of riverine oc will be retained in a reservoir moreover reservoir eutrophication can further increase oc storage song et al 2018 third riverine carbon burial is also spatially changing dam construction can greatly increase poc burial in reservoirs drake et al 2018 maavara et al 2017 regnier et al 2013 along with the ongoing boom in dam construction maavara et al 2017 projected a reservoir poc burial amount of 4 28 tg c yr in 2030 compared with 2 18 tg c yr in 2000 however increasing carbon retention in reservoirs would lead to a decreased poc content and sediment poc erosion downstream liu et al 2020 regnier et al 2013 after the completion of the three gorges dam the poc content in the lower yangtze river has significantly decreased moreover the riverbed has shifted from a poc sediment sink to a source dai and liu 2013 liu et al 2019a 2019b 5 3 2 riverine oc export to estuaries and oceans riverine oc export to estuaries is ecologically important and has been studied extensively liu et al 2020 wang et al 2012 but the estimations have large uncertainties dai et al 2012b ludwig et al 1996 meybeck 1982 the recently reported values are 170 360 tg c yr of doc and 170 240 tg c yr of poc supplementary table s3 the uncertainties are partly related to the highly temporal variations in riverine oc transport section 4 2 under the impacts of natural and human activities liu et al 2020 regnier et al 2013 in addition due to the spatial variations section 4 3 monitoring sites are also essential for estimating riverine oc export to estuaries previous studies used data collected near the sea land interface without a consistent standard dai et al 2012b huang et al 2012 tian et al 2013 which might be another reason for the estimation uncertainties table s3 in the yangtze river both in situ doc and poc concentrations showed increasing trends from upstream to downstream with ranges of 0 26 1 98 mg l and 0 19 1 34 mg l respectively figs 8c d therefore the representativeness of both sampling sites and monitoring time should be considered to reduce uncertainties oc export to estuaries is different from that to oceans regnier et al 2013 riverine oc would largely be removed in estuaries through photooxidation sedimentation flocculation and microbial respiration processes consequently only some terrestrial oc is further transported to oceans bauer et al 2013 regnier et al 2013 moreover the composition changes of riverine oc determine the transport distance taking the east china sea for example most riverine poc is deposited in nearshore estuarine waters deng et al 2006 in contrast riverine doc can diffuse over a relatively long distance bai et al 2013 in other words the oc composition changes in chinese rivers section 4 will influence the riverine carbon export to the oceans 6 conclusions in china human activities greatly changed the spatiotemporal variations of riverine oc transport during 2004 2018 anthropogenic sewage discharge indicated by nh 4 n was positively related to the riverine doc content r 0 81 p 0 01 and explained 85 59 of its spatial variation during 2004 2018 water pollution prevention and control strategies decreased doc in 60 98 of rivers meanwhile anthropogenic vegetation restoration and dam construction led to poc decreases in 90 48 of rivers as a result of artificial disturbance chinese rivers are losing their asian features of low doc poc and poc spm increasing doc poc ratios were found in 90 48 of rivers with 42 86 being significant organic and inorganic carbon cycles in rivers are interrelated and this study implies the need to dynamically estimate riverine greenhouse gas emissions sediment carbon burial and oc export to estuaries under the changing global background

15647,for mitigation of climate change all sources and sinks of greenhouse gases from the environment must be quantified and their driving factors identified nitrous oxide n2o is a strong greenhouse gas and the contribution of aquatic systems to the global n2o budget remains poorly constrained in this study we measured n2o concentrations in a eutrophic coastal system roskilde fjord denmark and combined measurements with statistical modeling to quantify the n2o fluxes and budget in the system over a period of six months to do so we collected water at 15 sampling points and measured n2o concentrations along with physico chemical water quality parameters e g temperature salinity dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus and silicon we used mixed effect regression models to predict n2o concentrations in the water from water quality parameters we then derived n2o fluxes using well established equations of n2o solubility and water atmosphere exchanges these fluxes were then put in perspective with those measured at the landscape scale by eddy covariance at a 96 m nearby tall tower and to those estimated from the agricultural land next to the fjord using intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc guidelines n2o concentrations in the roskilde fjord ranged between 2 40 and 8 05 nmol l 1 the best fitting model between water parameters and n2o concentrations in water included phosphorus and temperature we estimated that i roskilde fjord was a sink of n2o with a median inward flux of 0 04 nmol m 2 s 1 ii while the surrounding median agricultural flux was 0 13 0 18 nmol m 2 s 1 and iii the median landscape flux was 0 07 nmol m 2 s 1 all estimates of n2o fluxes were of the same magnitude and consistent with each other these preliminary results need to be consolidated by further research graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords greenhouse gas water atmosphere interface statistical modeling eddy covariance roskilde fjord data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrous oxide n2o is a potent and long lived greenhouse gas and the third contributor to global anthropogenic radiative forcing 0 17 0 14 to 0 20 w m 2 which amounts 6 4 of the total anthropogenic forcing myhre et al 2013 n2o has a wide range of anthropogenic and natural sources ipcc 2013 assessing the contribution of water systems especially eutrophicated ones to the global budget of n2o emissions is necessary for monitoring and understanding sources sinks and drivers of n2o atmospheric concentrations and to decide on mitigation strategies among semi natural systems oceans and coastal systems are considered important sources of n2o with ca 10 of total emissions turner et al 2015 yet the observations vary considerably between studies which investigated contrasted ecosystems from temperate estuaries to mangroves and included a limited spatial and temporal coverage bange 2006 garnier et al 2009 murray et al 2015 n2o production in aquatic environments results from microbiological activity that highly depends on the oxygen conditions and the availability of nitrogen as ammonium nitrite nitrate and nitrogen bound in organic matter murray et al 2015 estuaries and coastal systems receive large amounts of anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen cloern 2001 especially in landscapes with high agricultural activities de vries et al 2011 this nitrogen increases primary production favoring accumulation of organic matter in the water column and at the sea floor markager et al 2011 which is degraded into inorganic nitrogen through mineralization and further processes including nitrification and denitrification possibly producing n2o indeed n2o production has been shown to increase in sub optimal conditions of oxygen tension both in the case of nitrification bie et al 2002 cébron et al 2005 and denitrification tallec et al 2006 therefore apparently autochtonous nitrogen may originally come from external inputs asmala et al 2018 knudsen leerbeck et al 2017 for this reason n2o emissions from water systems are considered indirect emissions derived from human activities along with losses from agricultural fertilization considered as direct ones these indirect emissions may substantially contribute to total emissions at various scales from river basins borges et al 2018 marescaux et al 2018 to the global scale smith 2017 however n2o fluxes in aquatic ecosystems remain poorly quantified bange et al 2009 because of technical constrains associated with the highly variable fluxes of n2o in space and time indirect emissions may cause large uncertainties in n2o budgets smith 2017 therefore more measurements from different approaches are needed to improve the spatial and temporal coverage of data for n2o fluxes from aquatic systems ipcc 2006 and following ipcc reports estimating n2o fluxes from or to aquatic ecosystems relies on several techniques direct measurements by floating chambers small to landscape scale measurements by eddy covariance or calculations derived from n2o concentrations measured in the water all methods present shortcomings floating chambers and n2o concentration measurements at specific sampling points cannot cover large areas or yield high frequency time series while fluxes based on eddy covariance measurements rely on several uncertain assumptions on source locations combining independent methods at different spatial scales and temporal resolution offers an option to collect the best possible estimates of estuarine n2o fluxes as previously done with other greenhouse gases eugster et al 2003 morin et al 2017 podgrajsek et al 2014 schubert et al 2012 in this study we measured n2o water concentrations in the roskilde fjord and aimed at i statistically modeling n2o water concentrations over the study period and ii inferring the corresponding time series of n2o fluxes as secondary objective to internally evaluate the credibility of the estimated n2o fluxes of roskilde fjord we put these fluxes in perspective with eddy covariance measurements carried out for the same study site including a nearby agricultural area for which we also estimated n2o fluxes this study is among the first attempts to use eddy covariance at the land sea interface to assess n2o emissions in a heterogeneous coastal landscape 2 material and methods 2 1 the sampling site and sampling design roskilde fjord is a temperate eutrophic estuary pedersen et al 2014 and a branch of the isefjord in the zealand island denmark 55 41 5n 12 04 92e roskilde fjord is a long narrow width 0 5 10 km length 40 km and shallow 3 m estuary flowing into the kattegat fig 1 this estuary divides into two parts and the present study was conducted in the southern inner part of the roskilde fjord where salinity is moderate 14 g kg 1 and the residence time up to one year flindt et al 1997 there are no large rivers flowing into the roskilde fjord the freshwater comes from five small creeks 1116 l s 1 submarine groundwater discharge flow unknown and from a wastewater treatment plant serving the city of roskilde 237 l s 1 pedersen et al 2014 a 125 m tall tower at the risø campus of the technical university of denmark 55 69 n 12 09 e on the eastern shore of roskilde fjord was equipped in july 2014 with an eddy covariance sensor at 96 m high to monitor n2o fluxes from the surrounding landscape flux footprint estimations based on micrometeorological measurements and the footprint model by kormann and meixner 2001 indicated a range between 0 and 5 km daytime and 10 km night around the tower for this reason the present study was limited to these first 5 km the winds predominantly come from south west and westerly directions and the footprint area includes 36 km² of the inner roskilde fjord 46 of the daytime footprint to achieve our objectives we used two datasets in parallel one to build statistical models to explain concentrations of dissolved n2o in water and one to predict n2o dissolved concentration in water from these statistical models and to calculate subsequent n2o fluxes over the 6 month study period to build statistical models we used data measured at a set of sampling sites chosen to cover the study area 15 sampling points distributed on a rough grid fig 1 three sampling surveys were conducted on the 1st of may 8th of july and 17th of september 2014 at each of these sampling sites to predict time series of n2o concentrations and n2o fluxes we used the data collected at a long term water monitoring station corresponding to sampling site 2 2 2 chemical analyses 2 2 1 water samples at the 15 sampling points in may july and september water sampling was carried out by collecting 2 l of water at 1m depth using a standard ruttner water sampler 11 003 series 3 l we simultaneously measured temperature and salinity also at 1 m depth with a handheld field multiprobe ysi prodss ysi yellow springs oh usa a set of water samples were analyzed for dissolved no2 no3 and nh4 dissolved silicon dsi and dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip triplicate samples were taken at each sampling points in 30 ml acid washed plastic bottles and brought to the laboratory within two hours where they immediately were frozen to prevent any nitrogen consumption these samples were analyzed by scalar continuous flow analyser san as described by cauwet 1999 and holmes and colleagues 1999 detection limits were 0 04 0 1 0 3 0 06 and 0 2 µmol l 1 for no2 no3 nh4 dip and dsi respectively in this study n2o concentrations were analyzed for the first time in roskilde fjord to constitute this first dataset of n2o concentrations in water another set of water samples was collected at each sampling point a clean 150 ml glass bottle was rinsed then gently filled with sampled water avoiding any bubble we added a few droplets of a 5 solution of hgcl2 to stop all living activity and sealed the bottles the samples were shipped right after sampling to the umr metis cnrs france where they were stored refrigerated until analysis as follows a water sample aliquot 20 ml is used for determination of n2o in triplicates with a gas chromatograph gc perichrom st 200 equipped with an electron capture detector the detection limit is of 1 nmol n2o l 1 garnier et al 2009 the water sample is introduced in a degassing chamber through which a gaseous mixture of argon methane 90 10 passes and carries away the dissolved n2o this carrier stream contains water vapor which is eliminated in a glass tube filled with silica gel inserted upstream the n2o concentrator trap required before the connection to gc therefore the sweep gas passes through a molecular sieve trap cooled to 120 c by liquid nitrogen a switch valve puts then in communication the trap concentrator and the chromatographic column an ultra fast heating of the trap allows to reach 200 c temperature at which the desorption of n2o is complete and almost instantaneous calculations are based on calibrations done at least four times with a standard gas 2 2 2 water measurements at the long term monitoring site at a 34 year old long term water quality monitoring site corresponding to sampling point 2 of the present study the following concentrations were measured biweekly dissolved no2 no3 and nh4 for nitrogen dsi and dip temperature and salinity and chlorophyll a conley et al 2002 riemann et al 2016 here we only used the 6 month period corresponding to our n2o sampling campaigns 2 2 3 atmospheric n2o flux measurements the eddy covariance system consisted of an off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy laser analyzer model n2o co 23d los gatos research mountain view usa and a 3d ultrasonic anemometer usa 1 metek elmshorn germany the analyzer measured n2o co and h2o dry mixing ratios this enabled correcting for water vapor dilution effects ibrom et al 2007 air was sampled at 96 m via a 150 m long nylon tube with an inner diameter of 8 mm at a rate of 29 6 l min 1 using a vacuum pump xds 35i edwards crawley uk the turbulence data were sampled at 10 hz the fluxes were processed with the rcpm software including post processing routines morgenstern 2000 measurements started in july 2014 with gaps caused by pump and computer breakdowns for this study we selected five months of valid tower data between july and november 2014 missing data 8 wind speed was measured at 44 2 76 6 94 118 and 125 meters height the wind speed followed a natural logarithmic profile and we extrapolated it to 10 meters high for calculating the water air exchange coefficients due to uncertainties in the estimation of the footprint we chose to only use daytime data in sectors that cover the roskilde fjord western wind direction i e 0 35 and 195 360 2 3 statistical analyses and modeling of n2o concentrations in water beyond the descriptive analysis our statistical analyses aimed to i build models to explain the n2o concentrations in the roskilde fjord water from other water quality variables and ii use these models to predict n2o concentrations in our study site from these predicted concentrations we aimed to estimate n2o fluxes from roskilde fjord based on equations relying on temperature salinity wind speed and other variables onsite and to compare these values and their corresponding seasonal budget i to the eddy covariance measurements over the 5 km radius fetch of the tall tower and ii to a budget for the agricultural landscape calculated following the ipcc calculations guidelines we performed kruskal wallis tests to compare the water characteristics between the three surveys we aimed at building two statistical models to predict n2o concentrations the most simple one thereafter referred to as simplistic and the best goodness of fit one the simplistic one was designed to estimate n2o water concentration as simply as possible using only temperature as detailed below the goodness of fit one was designed to gain insight in the possible mechanisms involved in n2o production while being capable of predicting n2o concentrations in the roskilde fjord from the variables available in the study area and with the best predictive power the predicted n2o concentrations by each model as well as the n2o fluxes derived from them were compared to evaluate whether the simplistic model could be a valid option for monitoring sites with little equipment since we used repeated measurements may july and september in 15 sampling points over roskilde fjord thus violating the assumption of independency we used a mixed model able to account for such hierarchical structure including a random intercept for the sampling site and fixed effects for all the other variables wood 2006 zuur et al 2009a 2009b to test for any non linear relationships we also chose generalized additive mixed modeling with spline functions for all continuous variables therefore accounting for any non linear relationship to ensure a normal distribution of the residuals and homoscedasticity in the models as well as non negative concentrations of predicted n2o we log transformed n2o concentrations in the modeling analyses we back transformed the outputs of the model in the subsequent analyses we assumed that since temperature strongly controls microbial activities it would have the strongest effect on n2o dynamics of all available variables so in the first approach simplistic we built the simplest model by using log transformed n2o as response variable with only temperature as explanatory variable in the second approach best quality of fit we performed a stepwise variable selection to obtain the best goodness of fit and most parsimonious model adjusted for other variables for this reason we started our variable selection by adjusting for no2 no3 nh4 or din in separate models and then we further adjusted for dsi and dip to better take into account the role of eutrophication finally as the simplistic approach revealed a large effect of temperature we adjusted for temperature we selected the best quality of fit model according to i the akaike information criterion aic the lower the better the quality of fit and ii results of anova between models by increasing complexity statistical analyses were performed using r version 3 3 2 r core team 2015 and the package mgcv wood 2006 2 4 time interpolation of the data we aimed to construct a time series of the n2o fluxes between the aquatic system of roskilde fjord at the long term monitoring station of water quality corresponding to sampling point 2 and the atmosphere first to reconstruct n2o concentrations by statistical modeling over our 6 month study period we used the values of water parameters obtained close to monitoring station 2 since measurements of temperature salinity dsi and dip were conducted on a bi weekly frequency we linearly interpolated with a half hourly time step to match the frequency of the tall tower measurements used in the n2o flux calculations described hereafter given that the three surveys were conducted between may and september 2014 we defined a validity period for the predicting models based on the water temperature of the roskilde fjord we estimated that the models were reliable for temperatures 3 c above and below the maximum and minimum measured water temperatures between 10 and 25 c the resulting study period was six months between april the 16th and october the 31st of 2014 2 5 nitrous oxide flux calculations at sampling point 2 we calculated the n2o fluxes from roskilde fjord to atmosphere using the following equation 1 f n 2 o k w u c w c e where kw u is the gas transfer velocity m s 1 as a function of wind speed u in 10m height cw is the concentration measured or modeled in the water and ce is the equilibrium concentration of n2o calculation described hereafter the gas transfer velocity kw was calculated based on equations depending on three classes of wind speed as detailed in the synthesis by bange et al 2001 we used the equations of weiss and price 1980 to compute ce as following 2 c e x n 2 o b p where xn2o is the dry molar fraction of n2o in the atmosphere measured by the eddy covariance sensor b is the bunsen solubility calculated from temperature and salinity and p is the atmospheric pressure also from the eddy covariance sensor all the equations allowing for estimation of the variables needed for calculating n2o fluxes necessarily caused some uncertainty and error propagation bange et al 2001 2 6 towards generalization of the results over the 15 sampling points because the long term data collected in the monitoring station at sampling point 2 was not available at the other 14 sampling sites we compared sampling point 2 to the other 14 sampling points in term of water temperature and concentrations in water in an attempt to generalize our findings at sampling point 2 we conducted sensitivity analyses to predict n2o concentrations under the range of temperature salinity and water parameters collected in the 15 sampling sites and to calculate the corresponding n2o fluxes to do so we applied the exact same methodology as those described above but used several datasets in which we added or removed 10 to salinity temperature and dip in several combinations 2 7 nitrous oxide flux from the agricultural areas we gathered information for all registered crops for 2014 in our study area surface type of crop authorized maximal fertilization rate we used the following simplified ipcc tier 1 equation to compute the direct emissions from agriculture hergoualc h et al 2019 3 fn 2 o i e f i fni where i is the index of crops or pastures ef is the emission factor and fn is the amount of fertilizer efi took the values of 0 81 and 1 of the nitrogen applied in each crop and grassland respectively chirinda et al 2010 and we considered all nitrogen inputs to be synthetic fertilizers to complete this simplified calculation we used the formula developed by garnier et al 2019 that estimates at landscape scale n2o emissions from agricultural areas this formula is based on temperature and rainfall and input fertilizers supplementary materials for our study site and period we used 11 c as average annual temperature and 650 mm yr 1 as annual rainfall as a supplementary analysis to distinguish daytime measurements of n2o at the tall tower coming either from roskilde fjord or from the agricultural area we proceeded as follows to estimate agricultural fluxes we selected measurements of n2o fluxes at the tall tower coming only from the northeast of the tower defined as 30 100 to estimate fluxes coming from roskilde fjord we selected measurements of n2o fluxes at the tall tower coming only from between 270 and 360 the area including the less agricultural areas 3 results 3 1 water characteristics in the roskilde fjord 3 1 1 characteristics during the three surveys at the 15 sampling points the three surveys showed significantly different concentrations of no3 no2 nh4 dip and dsi table 1 in may after the spring bloom usually in march both dip and dissolved inorganic nitrogen din concentrations were low and often with a pronounced p limitation in july dip concentrations increased due to release from the anoxic sediments whereas din concentrations were still low din concentrations increased in september when phytoplankton production started to be light limited dsi was never limiting for production temperature followed irradiance and air temperature with a maximum in july august salinity only displayed small fluctuation driven by wind forced exchanges with the kattegat in particular temperature salinity and dip at sampling point 2 fell in the range of those measured at the other 14 sampling points albeit with a difference of around 10 20 with the median supplementary fig s1 3 1 2 interpolated time series at the sampling point 2 the interpolated temperature dip and dsi followed large seasonal variations fig 2 as suggested by our three samplings temperature globally followed a hill shaped curve from may to october at the sampling point 2 with a sudden decrease in july dip gradually increased from 0 to almost 10 µmol l 1 from may to the end of july then gradually decreased to 7 µmol l 1 dsi stagnated below 50 µmol l 1 until early july where it increased quickly above 150 µmol l 1 in august and decreased also quickly from september to november again below 50 µmol l 1 for comparison indicative half saturating constant for phytoplankton growth are 0 2 1 and 2 µmol l 1 for dip din and dsi respectively hinsby et al 2012 we used these interpolated temperature and phosphorus variables to estimate n2o concentrations using the simplistic and the best quality of fit models as described hereafter 3 2 n2o concentrations 3 2 1 concentrations at 15 sampling sites over the roskilde fjord the median n2o concentrations were 3 65 interquartile range iqr 3 49 3 93 2 81 2 70 2 91 and 5 87 5 72 6 06 nmol l 1 in the may july and september surveys respectively fig 3 we observed a maximal value of 8 0 nmol l 1 at the sampling point 1 on may 1st we considered it as an outlier because it was larger than the median plus 10 times the interquartile range and we discarded it from the rest of the statistical analyses after removing this outlier nitrous oxide concentration ranged between 2 4 and 6 4 nmol l 1 in the roskilde fjord between may and september 2014 with a median of 3 6 nmol l 1 iqr 2 8 nmol l 1 a kruskal wallis test indicated that the three surveys differed significantly p 0 001 n2o correlated well with no2 no3 and nh4 with significant spearman rho coefficients of 0 70 0 68 and 0 69 p 0 001 respectively 3 2 2 predicting time series of n2o concentrations at sampling point 2 simplistic approach in this approach aiming at using only temperature the model indicated a significant non linear effect of temperature the smooth term showed around six estimated degrees of freedom table 2 indicating six changes of the curve inflection throughout our range of measured temperatures fig 4 as the linear assumption was violated for temperature we chose to keep the spline function in the final simplistic model the r2 of this model was 0 92 aic 56 best quality of fit approach in this approach we included at first nitrogen variables in separate models but each of no3 nh4 and no2 were largely confounded by dip and even more by temperature as these models yielded small and non significant regression coefficients for nitrogen variables pooling the three nitrogen variables into one din variable yielded similar results therefore the final best quality of fit model included only temperature and dip both included with a spline function to account for possible non linearity the r2 of this model was 0 94 aic 70 adding dsi did not significantly improved the model r2 0 93 aic 71 we found a significant non linear effect for temperature and the model indicated five changes of the curve inflection table 2 and fig 4 we removed the spline function for dip because this model did not show any statistically significant deviation from linearity therefore obtaining a significant and positive coefficient for dip table s1 provides examples of predicted n2o water concentrations using the best quality of fit model for selected values of temperature and dip the predicted n2o concentrations showed slightly different temporal patterns between the two models fig 5 with a similar order of magnitude and a significant correlation between the two time series spearman rho coefficient of 0 55 p 0 001 despite excellent agreement between the measured and modelled n2o concentrations fig s2 at sampling point 2 for the may survey we found a measured n2o concentration somewhat higher than the predicted ones with the best quality of fit and simplistic models the predicted values are more consistent for the two other following surveys at sampling point 2 especially the best quality of fit model 3 3 n2o fluxes 3 3 1 time series over the roskilde fjord the two sets of estimated n2o concentrations at the sampling point 2 of the roskilde fjord yielded very similar temporal patterns of n2o fluxes fig 6 with a significant spearman correlation coefficient of 0 97 p 0 001 our results indicated that at this sampling point the roskilde fjord only absorbed n2o with a median of 0 04 0 08 0 01 and 0 03 0 07 0 01 nmol m 2 s 1 for the simplistic and the best quality of fit models respectively between april and december 2014 and 0 05 0 09 0 01 and 0 04 0 08 0 01 nmol m 2 s 1 between july and december the sensitivity analysis using temperature salinity and dip increased or decreased by 10 in several combinations to estimate n2o concentrations at other locations in the inner roskilde fjord did not change much the predicted n2o fluxes with medians ranging from 0 06 to 0 04 nmol m 2 s 1 table s2 the tall tower provided n2o fluxes from july in the period july december the daytime eddy covariance measurements on the tower restricted to those coming from the west where the roskilde fjord lies yielded a median flux of 0 07 0 04 0 21 nmol m 2 s 1 or 0 35 kg n ha 1 over this 6 month period 3 3 2 agricultural n2o fluxes the agricultural area was dominated by crops 77 of the agricultural surface especially wheat and winter rapeseed fertilization ranged from 0 to more than 300 kgn ha 1 year 1 on average 126 76 kgn ha 1 year 1 the simplified ipcc calculation and the landscape algorithm by garnier et al 2019 yielded n2o fluxes of 0 13 and 0 18 nmol m 2 s 1 respectively from the agricultural area in the fetch of the tall tower fig 6 this is also the same magnitude of the n2o fluxes measured at the tall tower restricting measurements to daytime northeastern sector of 0 06 0 01 0 17 nmol m 2 s 1 fig s3 4 discussion we estimated that the roskilde fjord could have absorbed n2o at a median rate of 0 04 nmol m 2 s 1 at the sampling point between may and december 2014 this is compatible with the daytime eddy covariance data at 96 m high on the risø tall tower restricted to western sectors which measured n2o fluxes in a daytime footprint of 5 km median of 0 07 nmol m 2 s 1 including a 24 km2 large agricultural area and with the estimated n2o budget of this agricultural area magnitude of 0 13 0 18 nmol m 2 s 1 4 1 the roskilde fjord overall status the water characteristics measured in our study are in agreement with the past measurements of nutrients and salinity in the inner roskilde fjord between 2006 and 2013 with slightly higher average salinity staehr et al 2017 and nutrient patterns typical of the roskilde fjord estuary knudsen leerbeck et al 2017 and of shallow temperate estuaries in general seasonally between 2006 and 2013 din and dip varied from close to 0 to 70 µmol din l 1 and 10 µmol dip l 1 respectively according to these past values din and dip concentrations were at their lowest during our three samplings 0 2 to 4 3 µmol din l 1 and 0 9 to 7 8 µmol dip l 1 see table 1 while higher concentrations could have been expected in winter time before april and after october i e at the time of nutrient replenishment and low biological uptake the quality of water in the inner roskilde fjord has been improving since 1990 with nitrogen and phosphorus loading reduced by more than 50 and 80 respectively clarke et al 2003 staehr et al 2017 phytoplankton growth was likely to be nitrogen limited at the time of our samplings especially in july riemann et al 2016 average chlorophyll a concentration was 4 5 µg l 1 between 2005 and 2014 staehr et al 2017 and 2 8 µg l 1 during our study period and dissolved organic carbon concentration was around 500 µmol l 1 in 2012 2016 asmala et al 2019 but these values cannot fully account for the nutrient loading or eutrophication status of roskilde fjord the high nutrient inputs in roskilde fjord do not result in high phytoplankton biomass between 2 and 6 µg l 1 of chlorophyll a during our study period due to complex ecosystem features such as dense macrophyte beds taking up nutrients and mussel beds taking up phytoplankton explaining the above mentioned high dissolved organic carbon concentration therefore a large part of nutrients entering roskilde fjord are recycled rapidly within the system these high nutrient inputs do not result in high phytoplankton biomass with chlorophyll a peaking at less than 10 µg l 1 in early spring riemann et al 2016 staehr et al 2017 4 2 n2o concentrations and fluxes in roskilde fjord water column n2o concentrations had not been measured previously in the roskilde fjord yet some values are available in other estuaries of the scandinavian region table 3 summarizes the n2o water concentrations in various estuaries for example in the baltic sea values of a magnitude of 9 4 to 11 1 nmol kg 1 were reported at 3 22m depth wilson et al 2018 and 11 8 to 24 4 nmol l 1 below 70 m myllykangas et al 2017 6 14 nmol n2o l 1 were reported in the southwestern baltic sea between 2006 and 2008 bange et al 2009 and a similar value between 1991 and 1992 in the central north sea bange et al 1996 yet the n2o concentrations in roskilde fjord were about 10 times lower than in the seine estuary strongly impacted by paris conurbation with at least 70 nmol n2o l 1 garnier et al 2006 or in the elbe estuary brase et al 2017 the estimated n2o fluxes at roskilde fjord median of 0 04 nmol m 2 s 1 fell within the lower end of previous observations of n2o fluxes in estuaries in temperate regions for instance livesley and andrusiak 2012 reported in a temperate estuary mornington peninsula victoria australia a range of fluxes between 0 025 and 0 417 nmol m 2 s 1 garnier et al 2009 reported a range of fluxes between 0 04 and 3 51 nmol m 2 s 1 in the seine basin france and foster and fulweiler 2016 reported a mean sd flux of 6 10 3 1 103 nmol m 2 s 1 in a shallow temperate estuary waquoit bay ma usa both the simplistic and quality of fit models had great predictive power the estimated n2o water concentrations differed substantially but the n2o fluxes derived from each model differed only marginally probably because at every moment all predicted n2o concentrations were always lower than the equilibrium concentrations it could be different in another estuary since our modeling approach was statistical and not deterministic the models we present cannot be used as is directly in other sites researchers willing to apply our methodology would have to find the coefficients that best fit their data 4 3 credibility of the n2o fluxes in roskilde fjord we believe our n2o flux estimations at sampling point 2 median fluxes of 0 05 and 0 04 nmol m 2 s 1 for the simplistic and the best goodness of fit models respectively are credible for several reasons 1 the sampling point 2 from which all n2o water concentrations and n2o fluxes were derived was very similar to the 14 other sampling points over roskilde fjord in terms of salinity temperature dip etc therefore estimates at this sampling point provide a likely magnitude of the fluxes occurring over the study area as also supported by the sensitivity analyses 2 the tall tower measured fluxes coming from the whole landscape in a 5 km radius including about 36 km² of the inner roskilde fjord and 24 km² of agricultural area in addition to the city of roskilde with several other sources of n2o such as an incinerator and a large wastewater treatment plant when considering only the fluxes coming from the western sector mainly occupied by roskilde fjord we estimated a median landscape budget of 0 07 0 04 0 21 nmol m 2 s 1 this western sector still includes parts of agricultural area intertwined in roskilde fjord and we estimated an annual n2o flux from the nearby agricultural area of 0 13 0 18 nmol m 2 s 1 therefore the tall tower measurements fell in between the estimates from roskilde fjord and the nearby agricultural area these estimates were derived from distinct methodologies and pertain to different scales therefore we cannot strictly compare them yet they provide a promising basis to future research to validate our estimates and our methodology 4 4 possible mechanisms of n2o synthesis we had hypothesized that nitrogen variables would play a key role in the mechanisms involved in n2o production with a contribution of dip as proxy for eutrophication yet our best quality of fit model does not include any nitrogen variables as it yielded small and non significant coefficients this was unexpected but several explanations are possible such as the benthic remineralization of sedimentary organic p aller and benninger 1981 sondergaard et al 2013 although benthic remineralization may not be directly linked to the n2o production it may act as a proxy for i oxic heterotrophic water column and sediment microbial respiration e g ammonification followed by ammonium oxidation and possible associated n2o emissions garnier et al 2007 ward et al 2008 for ii oxygen depleted conditions in the sediments e g the depth of the anoxic layer which govern anaerobic respiration with no3 oxidation i e denitrification and again n2o production as an intermediate compound froelich et al 1979 as previously reported these conditions of eutrophication fit well with observed annual denitrification patterns piña ochoa and álvarez cobelas 2006 the role of dip in this statistical modeling must be interpreted with caution in addition to a possible mechanistic explanation as described above dip could be the proxy of an unmeasured variable related for instance to sediment anoxia despite nitrogen variables are closer to n2o in the biological mechanisms din concentrations in the water column do not always reflect the nitrogen transformation as any free din level is about two orders of magnitude higher than n2o concentrations however we had no indicator of the sediment activity available such as bottom oxygen level over our 15 sampling sites to build our models since temperature controls most chemical reactions including denitrification both in the water column and the sediments bouletreau et al 2012 klein et al 2017 this may explain that temperature confounded nitrogen variables interestingly however significant relationships between n2o and no3 have been found in agricultural contaminated groundwaters vilain et al 2012 where eutrophication de facto does not occur however using other proxy variables specifically dip our models described well the variations of n2o concentrations of our study and we are confident that the estimated concentrations are reasonable thus contrary to a hypothesis of n2o supersaturation due to efficient n cycling in the roskilde fjord the negative fluxes that we estimated may result from a very efficient denitrification to n2 end product without n2o intermediates in the anoxic sediment water interface which is made possible by the shallow water depths and sediment rich in bioavailable organic matter rönner 1983 4 5 strengths limitations and general implications of the findings our study included 15 sampling points quite regularly distributed over the study area allowing for a good overview of the spatial variability of the measured biotic and abiotic variables at three different surveys accounting for different metabolic states of the roskilde fjord spring summer and autumn our modelling approach made it possible to account for the non linear relationship between temperature and n2o concentrations providing time series of n2o concentrations from an interpolated long term water monitoring station in the roskilde fjord these calculated n2o fluxes from the roskilde fjord also agree with the eddy covariance measurements on the tall tower nearby and the estimated n2o fluxes from the agricultural landscape this study was limited by the lack of eddy covariance data in the first months of 2014 so we could not put in perspective the different estimated fluxes roskilde fjord eddy covariance and agricultural area over a complete year and each method includes uncertainties in the estimation of n2o regarding the estimated n2o fluxes in roskilde fjord the complete approach relies on a series of assumptions to start with the predicted n2o concentrations in water were derived from statistical modeling the models showed each a high r2 coefficient and the data feeding the models was consistent with the data from the long term monitoring station 2 so that we chose dates that were representative of different key periods of roskilde fjord then we used well known equations to calculate equilibrium concentrations and to derive fluxes the risk of error propagation cannot be excluded for this reason we compared these fluxes to measurements by other metrics calculated independently such as those obtained at the tall tower regarding measured fluxes at the tall tower it remains difficult to clearly decipher between sources that may also have contributed to n2o fluxes for instance the incinerator of the roskilde city since roskilde fjord is surrounded by agricultural areas or by the city we cannot ascertain that the fluxes measured at the tall tower which we attempted to constrain from the northwest sector were only coming from the roskilde fjord in addition we constrained the measurements to daytime to restrict the spatial coverage of the eddy covariance measurements to close to the 5 km radius footprint but there was no way to ensure that fluxes did not come from further than 5 km from the tall tower therefore a certain amount of noise might exist in this signal due to the surrounding agricultural area regarding n2o fluxes from the nearby agricultural area the calculations are based on major hypotheses for the simplified ipcc calculations we did as if all n inputs were from synthetic fertilizers while there was probably some manure for this reason we used another formula to obtain another independent estimation of average annual agricultural flux in addition using these annual agricultural fluxes in the comparison of n2o fluxes in our study area has the following limitation an annual average does not depict the seasonal variations of n2o emissions that should be higher in early spring depending on the dates of fertilizer applications generally taking place at the beginning of the growing season finally we could not estimate n2o fluxes in the roskilde fjord in spring when nitrogen concentrations are higher but temperatures are lower we cannot ascertain whether roskilde fjord was a sink or a source of n2o before our study began as shown in table 3 several estuaries known to be eutrophic are indeed a source of n2o considering the atmospheric equilibrium concentration varying around 10 nmol l 1 weiss and price 1980 taking into account the temperature given roskilde fjord remains a eutrophic estuary despite major improvements since the past decades we had hypothesized it to be a source of n2o yet our findings suggest otherwise indeed all estimated fluxes were negative because at each date and sampling point over the study period n2o water concentrations never exceeded equilibrium concentrations fig 5 therefore our results suggest that roskilde fjord could be a sink of n2o at least during the study period this would not be the first temperate estuary reported as a n2o sink foster and fulweiler 2016 more research is thus needed to better quantify and understand n2o budgets in estuaries and to determine what makes some of them sinks for n2o the finding of undersaturation of n2o raises important questions most importantly on the extent to which other marine systems act as a sink for the greenhouse gas n2o estuaries may contribute as high as 5 of the recent worldwide n2o budget tian et al 2020 but their emissions could be misestimated maavara et al 2019 therefore we need more data and more tools to refine our current budget yet in terms of global budget even though all estuaries would act as n2o sinks which does not seem realistic this would decrease the estimated n2o emissions by seemingly less than 5 this also raises questions on the implications for the global budgets of other greenhouse gases mostly ch4 co2 but also on the mechanisms involved in n2o sinks and sources indeed n2o undersaturation suggests that processes consuming n2o are present in roskilde fjord bacterial consumption of n2o has been observed in the arctic but it remains unknown how widespread this phenomenon is in marine systems rees et al 2021 finally it raises the question of the conditions under which such mechanisms occur and to which extent they would be present in other ecosystems better understanding this variety of mechanisms may help better quantify n2o fluxes and adapt budgeting and designing local and global mitigation strategies 5 conclusions between may and october 2014 roskilde fjord was a sink of n2o with a median flux of 0 04 nmol m 2 s 1 based on measured and modelled n2o concentrations in the water and on measured temperature salinity n2o atmospheric concentration and wind speed unexpectedly including nitrogen variables in the modelling approach did not improve the model performance including dissolved inorganic phosphorus helped better capture the variation in n2o concentrations suggesting that p recycling p adsorption desorption benthic redox conditions uptake and mineralization might be a better proxy than dissolved inorganic nitrogen specifically linked to micro biological processes leading to n2o production in specific conditions in the period covered by both eddy covariance measurements and our modelling approach we found compatible order of magnitude for the fluxes from roskilde fjord and from the agricultural landscape our modeling approach proves an efficient method to generate time series of n2o fluxes from a water body the comparison between all estimates of n2o fluxes should be interpreted with caution as it aimed only to internally corroborate the estimations from roskilde fjord and includes some shortcomings

15647,for mitigation of climate change all sources and sinks of greenhouse gases from the environment must be quantified and their driving factors identified nitrous oxide n2o is a strong greenhouse gas and the contribution of aquatic systems to the global n2o budget remains poorly constrained in this study we measured n2o concentrations in a eutrophic coastal system roskilde fjord denmark and combined measurements with statistical modeling to quantify the n2o fluxes and budget in the system over a period of six months to do so we collected water at 15 sampling points and measured n2o concentrations along with physico chemical water quality parameters e g temperature salinity dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus and silicon we used mixed effect regression models to predict n2o concentrations in the water from water quality parameters we then derived n2o fluxes using well established equations of n2o solubility and water atmosphere exchanges these fluxes were then put in perspective with those measured at the landscape scale by eddy covariance at a 96 m nearby tall tower and to those estimated from the agricultural land next to the fjord using intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc guidelines n2o concentrations in the roskilde fjord ranged between 2 40 and 8 05 nmol l 1 the best fitting model between water parameters and n2o concentrations in water included phosphorus and temperature we estimated that i roskilde fjord was a sink of n2o with a median inward flux of 0 04 nmol m 2 s 1 ii while the surrounding median agricultural flux was 0 13 0 18 nmol m 2 s 1 and iii the median landscape flux was 0 07 nmol m 2 s 1 all estimates of n2o fluxes were of the same magnitude and consistent with each other these preliminary results need to be consolidated by further research graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords greenhouse gas water atmosphere interface statistical modeling eddy covariance roskilde fjord data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrous oxide n2o is a potent and long lived greenhouse gas and the third contributor to global anthropogenic radiative forcing 0 17 0 14 to 0 20 w m 2 which amounts 6 4 of the total anthropogenic forcing myhre et al 2013 n2o has a wide range of anthropogenic and natural sources ipcc 2013 assessing the contribution of water systems especially eutrophicated ones to the global budget of n2o emissions is necessary for monitoring and understanding sources sinks and drivers of n2o atmospheric concentrations and to decide on mitigation strategies among semi natural systems oceans and coastal systems are considered important sources of n2o with ca 10 of total emissions turner et al 2015 yet the observations vary considerably between studies which investigated contrasted ecosystems from temperate estuaries to mangroves and included a limited spatial and temporal coverage bange 2006 garnier et al 2009 murray et al 2015 n2o production in aquatic environments results from microbiological activity that highly depends on the oxygen conditions and the availability of nitrogen as ammonium nitrite nitrate and nitrogen bound in organic matter murray et al 2015 estuaries and coastal systems receive large amounts of anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen cloern 2001 especially in landscapes with high agricultural activities de vries et al 2011 this nitrogen increases primary production favoring accumulation of organic matter in the water column and at the sea floor markager et al 2011 which is degraded into inorganic nitrogen through mineralization and further processes including nitrification and denitrification possibly producing n2o indeed n2o production has been shown to increase in sub optimal conditions of oxygen tension both in the case of nitrification bie et al 2002 cébron et al 2005 and denitrification tallec et al 2006 therefore apparently autochtonous nitrogen may originally come from external inputs asmala et al 2018 knudsen leerbeck et al 2017 for this reason n2o emissions from water systems are considered indirect emissions derived from human activities along with losses from agricultural fertilization considered as direct ones these indirect emissions may substantially contribute to total emissions at various scales from river basins borges et al 2018 marescaux et al 2018 to the global scale smith 2017 however n2o fluxes in aquatic ecosystems remain poorly quantified bange et al 2009 because of technical constrains associated with the highly variable fluxes of n2o in space and time indirect emissions may cause large uncertainties in n2o budgets smith 2017 therefore more measurements from different approaches are needed to improve the spatial and temporal coverage of data for n2o fluxes from aquatic systems ipcc 2006 and following ipcc reports estimating n2o fluxes from or to aquatic ecosystems relies on several techniques direct measurements by floating chambers small to landscape scale measurements by eddy covariance or calculations derived from n2o concentrations measured in the water all methods present shortcomings floating chambers and n2o concentration measurements at specific sampling points cannot cover large areas or yield high frequency time series while fluxes based on eddy covariance measurements rely on several uncertain assumptions on source locations combining independent methods at different spatial scales and temporal resolution offers an option to collect the best possible estimates of estuarine n2o fluxes as previously done with other greenhouse gases eugster et al 2003 morin et al 2017 podgrajsek et al 2014 schubert et al 2012 in this study we measured n2o water concentrations in the roskilde fjord and aimed at i statistically modeling n2o water concentrations over the study period and ii inferring the corresponding time series of n2o fluxes as secondary objective to internally evaluate the credibility of the estimated n2o fluxes of roskilde fjord we put these fluxes in perspective with eddy covariance measurements carried out for the same study site including a nearby agricultural area for which we also estimated n2o fluxes this study is among the first attempts to use eddy covariance at the land sea interface to assess n2o emissions in a heterogeneous coastal landscape 2 material and methods 2 1 the sampling site and sampling design roskilde fjord is a temperate eutrophic estuary pedersen et al 2014 and a branch of the isefjord in the zealand island denmark 55 41 5n 12 04 92e roskilde fjord is a long narrow width 0 5 10 km length 40 km and shallow 3 m estuary flowing into the kattegat fig 1 this estuary divides into two parts and the present study was conducted in the southern inner part of the roskilde fjord where salinity is moderate 14 g kg 1 and the residence time up to one year flindt et al 1997 there are no large rivers flowing into the roskilde fjord the freshwater comes from five small creeks 1116 l s 1 submarine groundwater discharge flow unknown and from a wastewater treatment plant serving the city of roskilde 237 l s 1 pedersen et al 2014 a 125 m tall tower at the risø campus of the technical university of denmark 55 69 n 12 09 e on the eastern shore of roskilde fjord was equipped in july 2014 with an eddy covariance sensor at 96 m high to monitor n2o fluxes from the surrounding landscape flux footprint estimations based on micrometeorological measurements and the footprint model by kormann and meixner 2001 indicated a range between 0 and 5 km daytime and 10 km night around the tower for this reason the present study was limited to these first 5 km the winds predominantly come from south west and westerly directions and the footprint area includes 36 km² of the inner roskilde fjord 46 of the daytime footprint to achieve our objectives we used two datasets in parallel one to build statistical models to explain concentrations of dissolved n2o in water and one to predict n2o dissolved concentration in water from these statistical models and to calculate subsequent n2o fluxes over the 6 month study period to build statistical models we used data measured at a set of sampling sites chosen to cover the study area 15 sampling points distributed on a rough grid fig 1 three sampling surveys were conducted on the 1st of may 8th of july and 17th of september 2014 at each of these sampling sites to predict time series of n2o concentrations and n2o fluxes we used the data collected at a long term water monitoring station corresponding to sampling site 2 2 2 chemical analyses 2 2 1 water samples at the 15 sampling points in may july and september water sampling was carried out by collecting 2 l of water at 1m depth using a standard ruttner water sampler 11 003 series 3 l we simultaneously measured temperature and salinity also at 1 m depth with a handheld field multiprobe ysi prodss ysi yellow springs oh usa a set of water samples were analyzed for dissolved no2 no3 and nh4 dissolved silicon dsi and dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip triplicate samples were taken at each sampling points in 30 ml acid washed plastic bottles and brought to the laboratory within two hours where they immediately were frozen to prevent any nitrogen consumption these samples were analyzed by scalar continuous flow analyser san as described by cauwet 1999 and holmes and colleagues 1999 detection limits were 0 04 0 1 0 3 0 06 and 0 2 µmol l 1 for no2 no3 nh4 dip and dsi respectively in this study n2o concentrations were analyzed for the first time in roskilde fjord to constitute this first dataset of n2o concentrations in water another set of water samples was collected at each sampling point a clean 150 ml glass bottle was rinsed then gently filled with sampled water avoiding any bubble we added a few droplets of a 5 solution of hgcl2 to stop all living activity and sealed the bottles the samples were shipped right after sampling to the umr metis cnrs france where they were stored refrigerated until analysis as follows a water sample aliquot 20 ml is used for determination of n2o in triplicates with a gas chromatograph gc perichrom st 200 equipped with an electron capture detector the detection limit is of 1 nmol n2o l 1 garnier et al 2009 the water sample is introduced in a degassing chamber through which a gaseous mixture of argon methane 90 10 passes and carries away the dissolved n2o this carrier stream contains water vapor which is eliminated in a glass tube filled with silica gel inserted upstream the n2o concentrator trap required before the connection to gc therefore the sweep gas passes through a molecular sieve trap cooled to 120 c by liquid nitrogen a switch valve puts then in communication the trap concentrator and the chromatographic column an ultra fast heating of the trap allows to reach 200 c temperature at which the desorption of n2o is complete and almost instantaneous calculations are based on calibrations done at least four times with a standard gas 2 2 2 water measurements at the long term monitoring site at a 34 year old long term water quality monitoring site corresponding to sampling point 2 of the present study the following concentrations were measured biweekly dissolved no2 no3 and nh4 for nitrogen dsi and dip temperature and salinity and chlorophyll a conley et al 2002 riemann et al 2016 here we only used the 6 month period corresponding to our n2o sampling campaigns 2 2 3 atmospheric n2o flux measurements the eddy covariance system consisted of an off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy laser analyzer model n2o co 23d los gatos research mountain view usa and a 3d ultrasonic anemometer usa 1 metek elmshorn germany the analyzer measured n2o co and h2o dry mixing ratios this enabled correcting for water vapor dilution effects ibrom et al 2007 air was sampled at 96 m via a 150 m long nylon tube with an inner diameter of 8 mm at a rate of 29 6 l min 1 using a vacuum pump xds 35i edwards crawley uk the turbulence data were sampled at 10 hz the fluxes were processed with the rcpm software including post processing routines morgenstern 2000 measurements started in july 2014 with gaps caused by pump and computer breakdowns for this study we selected five months of valid tower data between july and november 2014 missing data 8 wind speed was measured at 44 2 76 6 94 118 and 125 meters height the wind speed followed a natural logarithmic profile and we extrapolated it to 10 meters high for calculating the water air exchange coefficients due to uncertainties in the estimation of the footprint we chose to only use daytime data in sectors that cover the roskilde fjord western wind direction i e 0 35 and 195 360 2 3 statistical analyses and modeling of n2o concentrations in water beyond the descriptive analysis our statistical analyses aimed to i build models to explain the n2o concentrations in the roskilde fjord water from other water quality variables and ii use these models to predict n2o concentrations in our study site from these predicted concentrations we aimed to estimate n2o fluxes from roskilde fjord based on equations relying on temperature salinity wind speed and other variables onsite and to compare these values and their corresponding seasonal budget i to the eddy covariance measurements over the 5 km radius fetch of the tall tower and ii to a budget for the agricultural landscape calculated following the ipcc calculations guidelines we performed kruskal wallis tests to compare the water characteristics between the three surveys we aimed at building two statistical models to predict n2o concentrations the most simple one thereafter referred to as simplistic and the best goodness of fit one the simplistic one was designed to estimate n2o water concentration as simply as possible using only temperature as detailed below the goodness of fit one was designed to gain insight in the possible mechanisms involved in n2o production while being capable of predicting n2o concentrations in the roskilde fjord from the variables available in the study area and with the best predictive power the predicted n2o concentrations by each model as well as the n2o fluxes derived from them were compared to evaluate whether the simplistic model could be a valid option for monitoring sites with little equipment since we used repeated measurements may july and september in 15 sampling points over roskilde fjord thus violating the assumption of independency we used a mixed model able to account for such hierarchical structure including a random intercept for the sampling site and fixed effects for all the other variables wood 2006 zuur et al 2009a 2009b to test for any non linear relationships we also chose generalized additive mixed modeling with spline functions for all continuous variables therefore accounting for any non linear relationship to ensure a normal distribution of the residuals and homoscedasticity in the models as well as non negative concentrations of predicted n2o we log transformed n2o concentrations in the modeling analyses we back transformed the outputs of the model in the subsequent analyses we assumed that since temperature strongly controls microbial activities it would have the strongest effect on n2o dynamics of all available variables so in the first approach simplistic we built the simplest model by using log transformed n2o as response variable with only temperature as explanatory variable in the second approach best quality of fit we performed a stepwise variable selection to obtain the best goodness of fit and most parsimonious model adjusted for other variables for this reason we started our variable selection by adjusting for no2 no3 nh4 or din in separate models and then we further adjusted for dsi and dip to better take into account the role of eutrophication finally as the simplistic approach revealed a large effect of temperature we adjusted for temperature we selected the best quality of fit model according to i the akaike information criterion aic the lower the better the quality of fit and ii results of anova between models by increasing complexity statistical analyses were performed using r version 3 3 2 r core team 2015 and the package mgcv wood 2006 2 4 time interpolation of the data we aimed to construct a time series of the n2o fluxes between the aquatic system of roskilde fjord at the long term monitoring station of water quality corresponding to sampling point 2 and the atmosphere first to reconstruct n2o concentrations by statistical modeling over our 6 month study period we used the values of water parameters obtained close to monitoring station 2 since measurements of temperature salinity dsi and dip were conducted on a bi weekly frequency we linearly interpolated with a half hourly time step to match the frequency of the tall tower measurements used in the n2o flux calculations described hereafter given that the three surveys were conducted between may and september 2014 we defined a validity period for the predicting models based on the water temperature of the roskilde fjord we estimated that the models were reliable for temperatures 3 c above and below the maximum and minimum measured water temperatures between 10 and 25 c the resulting study period was six months between april the 16th and october the 31st of 2014 2 5 nitrous oxide flux calculations at sampling point 2 we calculated the n2o fluxes from roskilde fjord to atmosphere using the following equation 1 f n 2 o k w u c w c e where kw u is the gas transfer velocity m s 1 as a function of wind speed u in 10m height cw is the concentration measured or modeled in the water and ce is the equilibrium concentration of n2o calculation described hereafter the gas transfer velocity kw was calculated based on equations depending on three classes of wind speed as detailed in the synthesis by bange et al 2001 we used the equations of weiss and price 1980 to compute ce as following 2 c e x n 2 o b p where xn2o is the dry molar fraction of n2o in the atmosphere measured by the eddy covariance sensor b is the bunsen solubility calculated from temperature and salinity and p is the atmospheric pressure also from the eddy covariance sensor all the equations allowing for estimation of the variables needed for calculating n2o fluxes necessarily caused some uncertainty and error propagation bange et al 2001 2 6 towards generalization of the results over the 15 sampling points because the long term data collected in the monitoring station at sampling point 2 was not available at the other 14 sampling sites we compared sampling point 2 to the other 14 sampling points in term of water temperature and concentrations in water in an attempt to generalize our findings at sampling point 2 we conducted sensitivity analyses to predict n2o concentrations under the range of temperature salinity and water parameters collected in the 15 sampling sites and to calculate the corresponding n2o fluxes to do so we applied the exact same methodology as those described above but used several datasets in which we added or removed 10 to salinity temperature and dip in several combinations 2 7 nitrous oxide flux from the agricultural areas we gathered information for all registered crops for 2014 in our study area surface type of crop authorized maximal fertilization rate we used the following simplified ipcc tier 1 equation to compute the direct emissions from agriculture hergoualc h et al 2019 3 fn 2 o i e f i fni where i is the index of crops or pastures ef is the emission factor and fn is the amount of fertilizer efi took the values of 0 81 and 1 of the nitrogen applied in each crop and grassland respectively chirinda et al 2010 and we considered all nitrogen inputs to be synthetic fertilizers to complete this simplified calculation we used the formula developed by garnier et al 2019 that estimates at landscape scale n2o emissions from agricultural areas this formula is based on temperature and rainfall and input fertilizers supplementary materials for our study site and period we used 11 c as average annual temperature and 650 mm yr 1 as annual rainfall as a supplementary analysis to distinguish daytime measurements of n2o at the tall tower coming either from roskilde fjord or from the agricultural area we proceeded as follows to estimate agricultural fluxes we selected measurements of n2o fluxes at the tall tower coming only from the northeast of the tower defined as 30 100 to estimate fluxes coming from roskilde fjord we selected measurements of n2o fluxes at the tall tower coming only from between 270 and 360 the area including the less agricultural areas 3 results 3 1 water characteristics in the roskilde fjord 3 1 1 characteristics during the three surveys at the 15 sampling points the three surveys showed significantly different concentrations of no3 no2 nh4 dip and dsi table 1 in may after the spring bloom usually in march both dip and dissolved inorganic nitrogen din concentrations were low and often with a pronounced p limitation in july dip concentrations increased due to release from the anoxic sediments whereas din concentrations were still low din concentrations increased in september when phytoplankton production started to be light limited dsi was never limiting for production temperature followed irradiance and air temperature with a maximum in july august salinity only displayed small fluctuation driven by wind forced exchanges with the kattegat in particular temperature salinity and dip at sampling point 2 fell in the range of those measured at the other 14 sampling points albeit with a difference of around 10 20 with the median supplementary fig s1 3 1 2 interpolated time series at the sampling point 2 the interpolated temperature dip and dsi followed large seasonal variations fig 2 as suggested by our three samplings temperature globally followed a hill shaped curve from may to october at the sampling point 2 with a sudden decrease in july dip gradually increased from 0 to almost 10 µmol l 1 from may to the end of july then gradually decreased to 7 µmol l 1 dsi stagnated below 50 µmol l 1 until early july where it increased quickly above 150 µmol l 1 in august and decreased also quickly from september to november again below 50 µmol l 1 for comparison indicative half saturating constant for phytoplankton growth are 0 2 1 and 2 µmol l 1 for dip din and dsi respectively hinsby et al 2012 we used these interpolated temperature and phosphorus variables to estimate n2o concentrations using the simplistic and the best quality of fit models as described hereafter 3 2 n2o concentrations 3 2 1 concentrations at 15 sampling sites over the roskilde fjord the median n2o concentrations were 3 65 interquartile range iqr 3 49 3 93 2 81 2 70 2 91 and 5 87 5 72 6 06 nmol l 1 in the may july and september surveys respectively fig 3 we observed a maximal value of 8 0 nmol l 1 at the sampling point 1 on may 1st we considered it as an outlier because it was larger than the median plus 10 times the interquartile range and we discarded it from the rest of the statistical analyses after removing this outlier nitrous oxide concentration ranged between 2 4 and 6 4 nmol l 1 in the roskilde fjord between may and september 2014 with a median of 3 6 nmol l 1 iqr 2 8 nmol l 1 a kruskal wallis test indicated that the three surveys differed significantly p 0 001 n2o correlated well with no2 no3 and nh4 with significant spearman rho coefficients of 0 70 0 68 and 0 69 p 0 001 respectively 3 2 2 predicting time series of n2o concentrations at sampling point 2 simplistic approach in this approach aiming at using only temperature the model indicated a significant non linear effect of temperature the smooth term showed around six estimated degrees of freedom table 2 indicating six changes of the curve inflection throughout our range of measured temperatures fig 4 as the linear assumption was violated for temperature we chose to keep the spline function in the final simplistic model the r2 of this model was 0 92 aic 56 best quality of fit approach in this approach we included at first nitrogen variables in separate models but each of no3 nh4 and no2 were largely confounded by dip and even more by temperature as these models yielded small and non significant regression coefficients for nitrogen variables pooling the three nitrogen variables into one din variable yielded similar results therefore the final best quality of fit model included only temperature and dip both included with a spline function to account for possible non linearity the r2 of this model was 0 94 aic 70 adding dsi did not significantly improved the model r2 0 93 aic 71 we found a significant non linear effect for temperature and the model indicated five changes of the curve inflection table 2 and fig 4 we removed the spline function for dip because this model did not show any statistically significant deviation from linearity therefore obtaining a significant and positive coefficient for dip table s1 provides examples of predicted n2o water concentrations using the best quality of fit model for selected values of temperature and dip the predicted n2o concentrations showed slightly different temporal patterns between the two models fig 5 with a similar order of magnitude and a significant correlation between the two time series spearman rho coefficient of 0 55 p 0 001 despite excellent agreement between the measured and modelled n2o concentrations fig s2 at sampling point 2 for the may survey we found a measured n2o concentration somewhat higher than the predicted ones with the best quality of fit and simplistic models the predicted values are more consistent for the two other following surveys at sampling point 2 especially the best quality of fit model 3 3 n2o fluxes 3 3 1 time series over the roskilde fjord the two sets of estimated n2o concentrations at the sampling point 2 of the roskilde fjord yielded very similar temporal patterns of n2o fluxes fig 6 with a significant spearman correlation coefficient of 0 97 p 0 001 our results indicated that at this sampling point the roskilde fjord only absorbed n2o with a median of 0 04 0 08 0 01 and 0 03 0 07 0 01 nmol m 2 s 1 for the simplistic and the best quality of fit models respectively between april and december 2014 and 0 05 0 09 0 01 and 0 04 0 08 0 01 nmol m 2 s 1 between july and december the sensitivity analysis using temperature salinity and dip increased or decreased by 10 in several combinations to estimate n2o concentrations at other locations in the inner roskilde fjord did not change much the predicted n2o fluxes with medians ranging from 0 06 to 0 04 nmol m 2 s 1 table s2 the tall tower provided n2o fluxes from july in the period july december the daytime eddy covariance measurements on the tower restricted to those coming from the west where the roskilde fjord lies yielded a median flux of 0 07 0 04 0 21 nmol m 2 s 1 or 0 35 kg n ha 1 over this 6 month period 3 3 2 agricultural n2o fluxes the agricultural area was dominated by crops 77 of the agricultural surface especially wheat and winter rapeseed fertilization ranged from 0 to more than 300 kgn ha 1 year 1 on average 126 76 kgn ha 1 year 1 the simplified ipcc calculation and the landscape algorithm by garnier et al 2019 yielded n2o fluxes of 0 13 and 0 18 nmol m 2 s 1 respectively from the agricultural area in the fetch of the tall tower fig 6 this is also the same magnitude of the n2o fluxes measured at the tall tower restricting measurements to daytime northeastern sector of 0 06 0 01 0 17 nmol m 2 s 1 fig s3 4 discussion we estimated that the roskilde fjord could have absorbed n2o at a median rate of 0 04 nmol m 2 s 1 at the sampling point between may and december 2014 this is compatible with the daytime eddy covariance data at 96 m high on the risø tall tower restricted to western sectors which measured n2o fluxes in a daytime footprint of 5 km median of 0 07 nmol m 2 s 1 including a 24 km2 large agricultural area and with the estimated n2o budget of this agricultural area magnitude of 0 13 0 18 nmol m 2 s 1 4 1 the roskilde fjord overall status the water characteristics measured in our study are in agreement with the past measurements of nutrients and salinity in the inner roskilde fjord between 2006 and 2013 with slightly higher average salinity staehr et al 2017 and nutrient patterns typical of the roskilde fjord estuary knudsen leerbeck et al 2017 and of shallow temperate estuaries in general seasonally between 2006 and 2013 din and dip varied from close to 0 to 70 µmol din l 1 and 10 µmol dip l 1 respectively according to these past values din and dip concentrations were at their lowest during our three samplings 0 2 to 4 3 µmol din l 1 and 0 9 to 7 8 µmol dip l 1 see table 1 while higher concentrations could have been expected in winter time before april and after october i e at the time of nutrient replenishment and low biological uptake the quality of water in the inner roskilde fjord has been improving since 1990 with nitrogen and phosphorus loading reduced by more than 50 and 80 respectively clarke et al 2003 staehr et al 2017 phytoplankton growth was likely to be nitrogen limited at the time of our samplings especially in july riemann et al 2016 average chlorophyll a concentration was 4 5 µg l 1 between 2005 and 2014 staehr et al 2017 and 2 8 µg l 1 during our study period and dissolved organic carbon concentration was around 500 µmol l 1 in 2012 2016 asmala et al 2019 but these values cannot fully account for the nutrient loading or eutrophication status of roskilde fjord the high nutrient inputs in roskilde fjord do not result in high phytoplankton biomass between 2 and 6 µg l 1 of chlorophyll a during our study period due to complex ecosystem features such as dense macrophyte beds taking up nutrients and mussel beds taking up phytoplankton explaining the above mentioned high dissolved organic carbon concentration therefore a large part of nutrients entering roskilde fjord are recycled rapidly within the system these high nutrient inputs do not result in high phytoplankton biomass with chlorophyll a peaking at less than 10 µg l 1 in early spring riemann et al 2016 staehr et al 2017 4 2 n2o concentrations and fluxes in roskilde fjord water column n2o concentrations had not been measured previously in the roskilde fjord yet some values are available in other estuaries of the scandinavian region table 3 summarizes the n2o water concentrations in various estuaries for example in the baltic sea values of a magnitude of 9 4 to 11 1 nmol kg 1 were reported at 3 22m depth wilson et al 2018 and 11 8 to 24 4 nmol l 1 below 70 m myllykangas et al 2017 6 14 nmol n2o l 1 were reported in the southwestern baltic sea between 2006 and 2008 bange et al 2009 and a similar value between 1991 and 1992 in the central north sea bange et al 1996 yet the n2o concentrations in roskilde fjord were about 10 times lower than in the seine estuary strongly impacted by paris conurbation with at least 70 nmol n2o l 1 garnier et al 2006 or in the elbe estuary brase et al 2017 the estimated n2o fluxes at roskilde fjord median of 0 04 nmol m 2 s 1 fell within the lower end of previous observations of n2o fluxes in estuaries in temperate regions for instance livesley and andrusiak 2012 reported in a temperate estuary mornington peninsula victoria australia a range of fluxes between 0 025 and 0 417 nmol m 2 s 1 garnier et al 2009 reported a range of fluxes between 0 04 and 3 51 nmol m 2 s 1 in the seine basin france and foster and fulweiler 2016 reported a mean sd flux of 6 10 3 1 103 nmol m 2 s 1 in a shallow temperate estuary waquoit bay ma usa both the simplistic and quality of fit models had great predictive power the estimated n2o water concentrations differed substantially but the n2o fluxes derived from each model differed only marginally probably because at every moment all predicted n2o concentrations were always lower than the equilibrium concentrations it could be different in another estuary since our modeling approach was statistical and not deterministic the models we present cannot be used as is directly in other sites researchers willing to apply our methodology would have to find the coefficients that best fit their data 4 3 credibility of the n2o fluxes in roskilde fjord we believe our n2o flux estimations at sampling point 2 median fluxes of 0 05 and 0 04 nmol m 2 s 1 for the simplistic and the best goodness of fit models respectively are credible for several reasons 1 the sampling point 2 from which all n2o water concentrations and n2o fluxes were derived was very similar to the 14 other sampling points over roskilde fjord in terms of salinity temperature dip etc therefore estimates at this sampling point provide a likely magnitude of the fluxes occurring over the study area as also supported by the sensitivity analyses 2 the tall tower measured fluxes coming from the whole landscape in a 5 km radius including about 36 km² of the inner roskilde fjord and 24 km² of agricultural area in addition to the city of roskilde with several other sources of n2o such as an incinerator and a large wastewater treatment plant when considering only the fluxes coming from the western sector mainly occupied by roskilde fjord we estimated a median landscape budget of 0 07 0 04 0 21 nmol m 2 s 1 this western sector still includes parts of agricultural area intertwined in roskilde fjord and we estimated an annual n2o flux from the nearby agricultural area of 0 13 0 18 nmol m 2 s 1 therefore the tall tower measurements fell in between the estimates from roskilde fjord and the nearby agricultural area these estimates were derived from distinct methodologies and pertain to different scales therefore we cannot strictly compare them yet they provide a promising basis to future research to validate our estimates and our methodology 4 4 possible mechanisms of n2o synthesis we had hypothesized that nitrogen variables would play a key role in the mechanisms involved in n2o production with a contribution of dip as proxy for eutrophication yet our best quality of fit model does not include any nitrogen variables as it yielded small and non significant coefficients this was unexpected but several explanations are possible such as the benthic remineralization of sedimentary organic p aller and benninger 1981 sondergaard et al 2013 although benthic remineralization may not be directly linked to the n2o production it may act as a proxy for i oxic heterotrophic water column and sediment microbial respiration e g ammonification followed by ammonium oxidation and possible associated n2o emissions garnier et al 2007 ward et al 2008 for ii oxygen depleted conditions in the sediments e g the depth of the anoxic layer which govern anaerobic respiration with no3 oxidation i e denitrification and again n2o production as an intermediate compound froelich et al 1979 as previously reported these conditions of eutrophication fit well with observed annual denitrification patterns piña ochoa and álvarez cobelas 2006 the role of dip in this statistical modeling must be interpreted with caution in addition to a possible mechanistic explanation as described above dip could be the proxy of an unmeasured variable related for instance to sediment anoxia despite nitrogen variables are closer to n2o in the biological mechanisms din concentrations in the water column do not always reflect the nitrogen transformation as any free din level is about two orders of magnitude higher than n2o concentrations however we had no indicator of the sediment activity available such as bottom oxygen level over our 15 sampling sites to build our models since temperature controls most chemical reactions including denitrification both in the water column and the sediments bouletreau et al 2012 klein et al 2017 this may explain that temperature confounded nitrogen variables interestingly however significant relationships between n2o and no3 have been found in agricultural contaminated groundwaters vilain et al 2012 where eutrophication de facto does not occur however using other proxy variables specifically dip our models described well the variations of n2o concentrations of our study and we are confident that the estimated concentrations are reasonable thus contrary to a hypothesis of n2o supersaturation due to efficient n cycling in the roskilde fjord the negative fluxes that we estimated may result from a very efficient denitrification to n2 end product without n2o intermediates in the anoxic sediment water interface which is made possible by the shallow water depths and sediment rich in bioavailable organic matter rönner 1983 4 5 strengths limitations and general implications of the findings our study included 15 sampling points quite regularly distributed over the study area allowing for a good overview of the spatial variability of the measured biotic and abiotic variables at three different surveys accounting for different metabolic states of the roskilde fjord spring summer and autumn our modelling approach made it possible to account for the non linear relationship between temperature and n2o concentrations providing time series of n2o concentrations from an interpolated long term water monitoring station in the roskilde fjord these calculated n2o fluxes from the roskilde fjord also agree with the eddy covariance measurements on the tall tower nearby and the estimated n2o fluxes from the agricultural landscape this study was limited by the lack of eddy covariance data in the first months of 2014 so we could not put in perspective the different estimated fluxes roskilde fjord eddy covariance and agricultural area over a complete year and each method includes uncertainties in the estimation of n2o regarding the estimated n2o fluxes in roskilde fjord the complete approach relies on a series of assumptions to start with the predicted n2o concentrations in water were derived from statistical modeling the models showed each a high r2 coefficient and the data feeding the models was consistent with the data from the long term monitoring station 2 so that we chose dates that were representative of different key periods of roskilde fjord then we used well known equations to calculate equilibrium concentrations and to derive fluxes the risk of error propagation cannot be excluded for this reason we compared these fluxes to measurements by other metrics calculated independently such as those obtained at the tall tower regarding measured fluxes at the tall tower it remains difficult to clearly decipher between sources that may also have contributed to n2o fluxes for instance the incinerator of the roskilde city since roskilde fjord is surrounded by agricultural areas or by the city we cannot ascertain that the fluxes measured at the tall tower which we attempted to constrain from the northwest sector were only coming from the roskilde fjord in addition we constrained the measurements to daytime to restrict the spatial coverage of the eddy covariance measurements to close to the 5 km radius footprint but there was no way to ensure that fluxes did not come from further than 5 km from the tall tower therefore a certain amount of noise might exist in this signal due to the surrounding agricultural area regarding n2o fluxes from the nearby agricultural area the calculations are based on major hypotheses for the simplified ipcc calculations we did as if all n inputs were from synthetic fertilizers while there was probably some manure for this reason we used another formula to obtain another independent estimation of average annual agricultural flux in addition using these annual agricultural fluxes in the comparison of n2o fluxes in our study area has the following limitation an annual average does not depict the seasonal variations of n2o emissions that should be higher in early spring depending on the dates of fertilizer applications generally taking place at the beginning of the growing season finally we could not estimate n2o fluxes in the roskilde fjord in spring when nitrogen concentrations are higher but temperatures are lower we cannot ascertain whether roskilde fjord was a sink or a source of n2o before our study began as shown in table 3 several estuaries known to be eutrophic are indeed a source of n2o considering the atmospheric equilibrium concentration varying around 10 nmol l 1 weiss and price 1980 taking into account the temperature given roskilde fjord remains a eutrophic estuary despite major improvements since the past decades we had hypothesized it to be a source of n2o yet our findings suggest otherwise indeed all estimated fluxes were negative because at each date and sampling point over the study period n2o water concentrations never exceeded equilibrium concentrations fig 5 therefore our results suggest that roskilde fjord could be a sink of n2o at least during the study period this would not be the first temperate estuary reported as a n2o sink foster and fulweiler 2016 more research is thus needed to better quantify and understand n2o budgets in estuaries and to determine what makes some of them sinks for n2o the finding of undersaturation of n2o raises important questions most importantly on the extent to which other marine systems act as a sink for the greenhouse gas n2o estuaries may contribute as high as 5 of the recent worldwide n2o budget tian et al 2020 but their emissions could be misestimated maavara et al 2019 therefore we need more data and more tools to refine our current budget yet in terms of global budget even though all estuaries would act as n2o sinks which does not seem realistic this would decrease the estimated n2o emissions by seemingly less than 5 this also raises questions on the implications for the global budgets of other greenhouse gases mostly ch4 co2 but also on the mechanisms involved in n2o sinks and sources indeed n2o undersaturation suggests that processes consuming n2o are present in roskilde fjord bacterial consumption of n2o has been observed in the arctic but it remains unknown how widespread this phenomenon is in marine systems rees et al 2021 finally it raises the question of the conditions under which such mechanisms occur and to which extent they would be present in other ecosystems better understanding this variety of mechanisms may help better quantify n2o fluxes and adapt budgeting and designing local and global mitigation strategies 5 conclusions between may and october 2014 roskilde fjord was a sink of n2o with a median flux of 0 04 nmol m 2 s 1 based on measured and modelled n2o concentrations in the water and on measured temperature salinity n2o atmospheric concentration and wind speed unexpectedly including nitrogen variables in the modelling approach did not improve the model performance including dissolved inorganic phosphorus helped better capture the variation in n2o concentrations suggesting that p recycling p adsorption desorption benthic redox conditions uptake and mineralization might be a better proxy than dissolved inorganic nitrogen specifically linked to micro biological processes leading to n2o production in specific conditions in the period covered by both eddy covariance measurements and our modelling approach we found compatible order of magnitude for the fluxes from roskilde fjord and from the agricultural landscape our modeling approach proves an efficient method to generate time series of n2o fluxes from a water body the comparison between all estimates of n2o fluxes should be interpreted with caution as it aimed only to internally corroborate the estimations from roskilde fjord and includes some shortcomings

15648,human urine can be treated and concentrated using reverse osmosis ro but this process also concentrates pharmaceuticals and undesirable salts along with valuable nutrients such as urea the final fertilizer product therefore has limited use on salt sensitive crops or edible crops as the effects of pharmaceuticals remain a concern tight and loose nanofiltration nf pre treatment was investigated as a method to recover urea in the permeate which could then be further concentrated using ro whilst pharmaceuticals and undesirable salts would be removed in the brine both nf options removed pharmaceuticals nf90 99 nf270 70 using a loose nf membrane 78 of the urea was recovered in the permeate 80 water removal however the salt removal was poor 44 and the urea purity only increased from 37 to 56 tight nf membranes provided better rejection of salts and organics 96 and 90 removed respectively the urea purity in the permeate 75 water removal from the tight nf process was 89 however the urea recovered was lower 48 the tight nf permeate was then further concentrated with ro at an overall water removal of 80 32 7 of the urea could be recovered with a purity of 85 a decision tree was also developed to determine the optimum treatment process based on the desired final product this decision tree could be used to determine the economic feasibility of each treatment process based on the final product choice and product value graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fertilizers membranes nitrogen nutrient recovery pharmaceuticals resource recovery 1 introduction significant research has been conducted over the past twenty years investigating the potential of using urine as a sustainable alternative to synthetic fertilizers as well as the processes required to make this feasible larsen et al 2021 important aspects to consider include source separation and urine collection flanagan and randall 2018 gundlach et al 2021 urine derived fertilizer effectivity martin et al 2020 public perception simha et al 2018 stabilization and disinfection herraiz carboné et al 2021 randall et al 2016 transport logistics and economics chipako and randall 2020 and methods for nutrient recovery larsen et al 2021 due to the high water content of urine it is important to either extract the desired fertilizer components or concentrate the urine to reduce the costs associated with transporting the fertilizer product maurer et al 2006 urine should also be stabilized to prevent urea hydrolysis as this allows for maximum nitrogen recovery randall et al 2016 and avoids losses in the collection phase due to ammonia volatilization urine can be stabilized with ca oh 2 which results in the precipitation of calcium phosphate an effective organic fertilizer meyer et al 2018 over 96 of the phosphorus present in urine could be recovered using ca oh 2 stabilization flanagan and randall 2018 reverse osmosis ro has shown promise as a potential treatment method to concentrate unhydrolyzed urine courtney and randall 2022 previous urine membrane filtration research was limited to hydrolyzed urine ek et al 2006 as urea being a small and uncharged compound was difficult to recover in the brine using brackish water ro and nanofiltration nf membranes ray et al 2020 however courtney and randall 2022 showed that using a high pressure seawater ro membrane along with an air bubbling pre treatment step ca oh 2 stabilized urine could be concentrated by at least a factor of 2 5 whilst also recovering 86 of the urea in the brine stream the urine could have theoretically been concentrated even further and was only limited by the scale of the laboratory equipment there are however limitations with a process that only uses ro to concentrate urine for example the majority of pharmaceutically active compounds phacs ingested are excreted via urine lienert et al 2007 and urine also contains many other undesirable salts and organics the rejection properties for high pressure seawater ro membranes result in the majority of salts organics and any phacs present in the urine being concentrated along with the valuable fertilizer nutrients whilst crops fertilized with urine have comparable yields to those treated with synthetic fertilizers pandorf et al 2018 application rates need to be adjusted based on a crop s salt sensitivity to maximize yield mnkeni et al 2008 crop uptake of phacs also requires consideration and any safety concerns could be avoided by limiting urine derived fertilizer use to non food related agriculture such as flower farming however salt tolerance would still need to be considered which could potentially limit the commercial appeal of the urine derived fertilizers a method to recover a purer urea stream that still contains other key fertilizer nutrients could therefore increase the value of the final fertilizer product or be used to produce alternative urea based products marepula et al 2021 whilst advanced oxidation processes ultra violet h2o2 or a combination have shown potential for phac degradation in urine zhang et al 2015 these processes do not remove by products formed during the treatment process physical removal of the phacs such as using granular activated carbon gac köpping et al 2020 would be more robust however gac also absorbs urea and therefore is not a suitable treatment method for stabilized urine where the urea has not degraded pronk et al 2006 observed that nf of unhydrolyzed urine resulted in poor urea rejection 20 whilst phacs were retained in the brine stream they suggested that nf could be used to rather recover urea in the permeate stream nanofiltration membranes are generally classified as either loose or tight membranes schäfer and fane 2021 nanofiltration membranes provide good rejection of divalent ions but they have limited rejection capacity for monovalent ions bergman 2007 however tight nf membranes have shown to have improved rejection capacity for monovalent ions thamaraiselvan et al 2018 tight nf membranes also improve urea rejection 46 58 urea rejection nf90 ray et al 2020 compared to loose nf membrane 10 20 nf270 pronk et al 2006 a loose nf membrane could potentially be used as pre treatment to removal phacs from urine whilst a tight nf membrane could be used to remove undesirable salts in addition to phacs thus resulting in a purer urea product stream however the lower urea recovery in the permeate stream due to the higher rejection capabilities of tight nf membranes would need to be considered the permeate stream could then be concentrated further using seawater ro to produce a concentrated and purified urea product stream the recovery and purity of urea in the permeate will also be affected by the extent of the volume reduction factor vrf amount of water removed as permeate many rejection studies are limited to vrf of 2 5 water removal of 60 at high vrfs the feed becomes increasingly concentrated and there is the potential for concentration polarization which reduces rejection capacity bergman 2007 it is therefore important to assess salt rejection and urea recoveries at high vrfs the aim of this work was therefore to determine if a hybrid nf and ro process could be used to recover urea from urine in a purer form by removing undesirable salts organics and phacs this was achieved by 1 determining the rejection capabilities of loose and tight nf membranes with regards to urea undesirable salts organics and pharmaceuticals 2 comparing how urea and salt rejection is affected as the vrf increases 3 assessing the overall recovery and purity of urea when the nf permeate was further concentrated with a seawater ro membrane 2 materials and methods 2 1 urine collection and preparation all experiments were conducted with urine stabilized with 10 g l 1 ca oh 2 synthetic and real that was pre treated with air bubbling as per the method described by courtney et al 2021 synthetic urine was used to ensure consistent composition between experiments see the supplementary information for the synthetic urine recipe real urine was collected in waterless urinals pre dosed with 10 g l 1 ca oh 2 flanagan and randall 2018 from at least 10 men and women working in the new engineering building at the university of cape town detailed compositions of the real urine are available in table s1 due to collection limitations the real urine composition could not be kept constant across all experiments as not enough urine could be collected at once both real and synthetic urine stabilized with ca oh 2 were then pre treated with air bubbling following the method developed by courtney et al 2021 to remove excess calcium all urine was filtered with 0 45 µm filter paper chm lab group spain after air bubbling and before nanofiltration treatment 2 2 pharmaceutical dosing six different pharmaceuticals three acidic and three basic of varying molecular weight were chosen to compare the rejection capacity of tight and loose nf membranes the properties of each pharmaceutical compound are summarized below in table 1 each pharmaceutical was dosed at 100 mg l 1 whilst this concentration is higher than measured in real urine it was chosen to ensure that at least 99 rejection could be accurately measured based on the method detection limit mdl the phacs are costly and the ones used in this study were all donations the stock of tenofovir and stavudine was unfortunately not sufficient for use in the experiments with real urine 2 3 membranes and equipment setup all experiments were carried out in a laboratory scale cross flow membrane testing unit sepa cf sterlitech usa the effective membrane area was 0 14 m2 the complete membrane filtration equipment consisted of a feed tank that was temperature controlled with a chiller hh 25 jeiotech south korea and water circulation the feed was circulated using a high pressure pump m 03s hydra cell minneapolis usa and the transmembrane pressure was controlled using a pressure control valve the brine flow rate was measured with a flow meter lzt 1002 g 1 7 l min 1 wet technologies strand south africa the permeate stream was collected and continuously weighed on a digital mass balance ps 8100 x 2 radwag poland to determine the permeate flux the pressure pt100r 13 lu2 h1131 turck germany temperature and conductivity mettler toledo usa and ph h1 5221 hanna johannesburg south africa of the permeate and brine was also continuously measured the following filmtec membranes were used nf270 nf90 and sw30 the nf270 is considered a loose nf membrane the nf90 is a tight nf membrane and the sw30 membrane is typically used for seawater desalination 2 4 experimental conditions and methods all membranes were prepared by pre soaking in de ionized water for at least 24 h de ionized water was then circulated through the system at 35 bar 55 bar for the sw30 for at least 2 h to compact the membrane and ensure steady flux the feed flow rate was 6 8 l min 1 maximum feed flow rate advised by equipment supplier which corresponds to a tangential velocity of 1 09 m s 1 this was repeated for the feed solution and a new membrane was used for each experimental run the concentration of pharmaceuticals was measured in the feed solution before and after the circulation period to determine if any adsorption to the membrane had occurred a high operating pressure 35 bar was chosen for the nf membrane experiments to ensure sufficient driving force to overcome the osmotic pressure of urine the effect of membrane operating pressure on urea and ion rejection was investigated and the results are given in the supplementary information for the nf experiments enough permeate was collected to achieve a vrf of 5 80 water removal for the nf270 membrane due to a minimum liquid volume requirement in the feed tank to protect the pump and a vrf of 4 75 water removal for the nf90 membrane due to flux decline caused by the increased concentration of the feed pharmaceutical rejection was analyzed at a vrf of 2 water removal of 50 for consistent comparison the permeate collected from the nf90 real urine experiment was further concentrated using a sw30 membrane at 55 bar due to the poor purification properties of the nf270 membrane it was determined that further concentration of the permeate from these experiments was not feasible both real and synthetic urine was used for each experimental condition to calculate urea purity of a stream the concentration of urea in the stream was first analyzed the water from 100 ml of the stream was evaporated of at 30 c to prevent urea hydrolysis and the mass of dried solids was then weighed a known mass of the dried sample was then re dissolved in de ionized water and the urea was re measured to confirm no hydrolysis had occurred the urea purity was then calculated as the mass of urea as a percentage of the total dissolved solids the concentration of ammonia was less than 1 of the measured ions in all samples tested for purity therefore it was determined that any ammonia loss during drying would not significantly contribute to the urea purity calculations 2 5 analytical methods colorimetric methods were used to determine the concentration of urea total ammoniacal nitrogen tan po4 3 p mg2 ca2 so4 2 cl and k where required this process was automated with a gallery discrete analyzer thermofisher scientific massachusetts using standard methods of the equipment the concentration of sodium was determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry 5900 svdv agilent usa the chemical oxygen demand cod of a sample was measured with medium range reagent vials hi94754b 25 hanna johannesburg and a multiparameter photometer h183399 hanna johannesburg the cod was used as a proxy for the concentration of organics li and liu 2018 removed using membrane filtration all liquid samples were analyzed within 30 min of sampling pharmaceuticals were measured using an agilent 1220 infinity liquid chromatograph agilent technology inc switzerland equipped with an agilent poroshel 120 c18 column 4 3 cm x 50 mm x 2 7 µm chromatographic separations were performed at 35 c using 15 mm phosphate buffer ph 3 25 a and acetonitrile b as mobile phase with gradient elution at a flow rate of 0 8 ml min detection of all the components was carried out at 210 nm and completed within 15 min 3 results and discussion 3 1 pharmaceutical rejection fig 1 compares the rejection of six phacs by the nf90 and nf270 membranes the molecular weight mw of the phacs increases from left to right the tight nf90 membrane provided high rejections of pharmaceuticals 98 while for the nf270 membrane at least 73 of all the phacs were rejected these results were agreeable with those of pronk et al 2006 for phacs with similar mws tenofovir appeared to have degraded in the synthetic stabilized urine ph 7 0 which could explain the high rejection 99 achieved in comparison to the other two acidic pharmaceuticals which had lower rejections compared to the basic compounds for the nf270 membrane although tenofovir was not present for the real urine experiments it is likely that a similar high rejection would have been observed for the nf270 there was no observable trend between rejection and mw there was no significant difference in the concentrations of the pharmaceuticals before and after membrane equilibration it is therefore unlikely that significant membrane adsorption occurred it is likely that other membrane characteristics such as surface charge and solution ph played a role in rejection pronk et al 2006 showed that for basic compounds rejection decreases with increasing ph due to increased absorption of the positively charged compound to the negatively charged membrane with the reverse occurring for acidic compounds real urine dosed with phacs has a ph of 8 0 compared to 7 0 for synthetic urine which would explain why the rejection of basic compounds was lower in real urine compared to synthetic urine it is likely that a similar trend would have been observed with stavudine in real urine these aspects should be investigated further in future work though alternatively rejection may be influenced by differences in the osmotic pressure of real and synthetic urine caused by the rejection of organics pronk et al 2006 in general both the nf90 and nf270 membrane are suitable for the removal of a broad spectrum of phacs 3 2 urea purification using nanofiltration to determine if a purer urea stream could be recovered from urine using nf the urea ion and cod rejection were measured as a function of volume reduction factor vrf shown in fig 2 where vrf is the ratio of the starting volume to the brine volume remaining urea typically consists of 37 4 of the tds in urine this will vary based on urine composition for the loose nf270 membrane urea rejection was low less than 10 and decreased further as more permeate was recovered the rejection rates for real and synthetic urine were in a similar range to those achieved by pronk et al 2006 using the same membrane for the synthetic urine experiments 77 6 of the urea was recovered in the permeate at an 80 water removal flux decline due to fouling was observed for real urine as such only 75 of the water could be recovered as permeate however the urea recovery in the permeate is comparable with synthetic urine fig 2b rejection of monovalent ions by the nf270 membrane was poor 55 which can be observed by the high conductivity in the permeate 6 12 ms cm 1 as shown in fig 2c rejection of ions was comparable for real and synthetic urine the differences in permeate conductivity are due to the differences in initial conductivity of the two streams the nf270 provided 70 rejection of organic compounds measured as cod at a vrf of 4 46 of the ions and 78 of the cod was removed this increased the urea purity from 37 to 56 the urea rejection rates for the tight nf90 membrane were higher than for the nf270 membrane and decreased with increasing permeate recovery these results agreed with those of ray et al 2020 who observed a urea rejection of approximately 55 for real fresh urine at a vrf of 1 1 urea rejection by the nf90 membrane increased significantly 20 between synthetic and real urine pronk et al 2006 hypothesized that this phenomenon could be attributed to the formation of organic matrices that increased the size of urea and thus increased rejection the nf90 provided high rejection of ions resulting in a permeate conductivity of 0 6 ms cm 1 for real urine fig 2c rejection of cod was greater than 95 at a water removal permeate of 75 for real urine 48 of the urea was recovered 90 of the cod was removed and 97 of the ions were removed resulting in increased urea purity from 37 to 89 concentrating the nf permeate stream using swro membranes would further decrease the recovery of urea since approximately 14 of the total urea is lost using a swro membrane courtney and randall 2022 due to the poor rejection of salts by the nf270 membrane only further concentration of the nf90 permeate using ro was investigated however the nf270 membrane is advantageous as it has a higher permeate flux and lower urea rejection compared to the nf90 membrane this results in a smaller nf setup being required and increased urea recovery in the permeate however the low rejection of monovalent ions 55 compared to 80 for divalent ions does not significantly improve the urea purity replacement of monovalent ions with divalent ions using ion exchange resins would increase their rejection and thus result in a purer urea stream hilal et al 2015a exchanged up to 80 of the chloride ions with sulfate ions depending on dose and contact time in seawater hilal et al 2015b further observed that permeate flux using an nf90 membrane increased from 4 to 11 l m 2 h 1 after seawater was treated with ion exchange an ion exchange pre treatment step should therefore be further investigated for this integrated urine treatment process 3 3 further concentration of nf permeate using ro whilst nf can be used to improve the purity of urine by removing organics undesirable salts and phacs these membranes do not sufficiently reduce the volume of the stream further concentration using ro is therefore still required for transportation of the final product to be economically feasible the nf90 permeate from real urine was further concentrated to a volume reduction factor of 2 5 and the urea rejection was monitored fig 3 a the vrf was limited due to the volume of permeate available and the minimum liquid volume required in the feed tank the relationship between vrf and urea rejection was then used to predict urea recovery and purity if the permeate was concentrated beyond a vrf of 2 5 fig 3b rejection of urea for both real and synthetic permeate was consistent this was expected as the majority of organics present in real urine are removed during the nf pre treatment and can therefore no longer influence urea rejection as hypothesized by pronk et al 2006 higher urea rejection by the nf90 membrane for real urine compared to synthetic urine results in lower urea recovery in the permeate and therefore lower overall recovery as the permeate is further concentrated using swro the purity of synthetic urine was also slightly higher than real urine due to the simplified concentration of organics used in the synthetic urine recipe it is advised that overall water removal for the hybrid nf ro system should be limited to 80 since above this both urea purity and recovery decrease substantially fig 4 gives a summary mass balance for the tight nf ro process with an overall volume reduction of 80 the final concentrated liquid fertilizer would have a urea purity of 89 with an overall urea recovery of 32 7 in comparison to a different process to recover and purify urea from urine marepula et al 2021 used an evaporation and ethanol purification process and was able to recover a dry product which contained 67 of the original urea with a purity of 76 in addition there is still considerable urea in the nf concentrate stream that could also be further treated to recover more urea as the nf brine still contains the majority of organics further treatment with a membrane process forward osmosis membrane distillation or ro would likely result in fouling further concentration with a process such as evaporation or freeze concentration would be suitable as these processes are not affected by fouling a process such as the one developed by marepula et al 2021 could also be used as there is a much smaller volume of water to remove by evaporation this would increase the overall urea recovery to at least 67 a freeze concentration process such as the one developed by noe hays et al 2021 could also be used their process treated hydrolyzed urine and achieved a nitrogen recovery of 92 with a vrf of 5 8 however since this process treated hydrolyzed urine it is unclear what the urea recovery would be if stabilized urine was treated with a freeze concentration process whilst almost 68 of the urea would be lost using a nf ro treatment process this process cannot be directly compared to studies that investigated nutrient recovery from hydrolyzed or fresh non stabilized urine as many of these previous studies did not account for n lost through ammonia volatilization during the urine collection or storage phase an analysis of at least 10 studies using hydrolyzed urine estimated that the n losses due to volatilization could range anywhere from 0 44 see section 2 3 in the supplementary information nitrogen loss from non stabilized urine will vary significantly depending on collection

recover nutrients will vary depending on the desired end product and its use a decision tree is shown in fig 5 that can be used to decide which membrane treatment option to use whilst a treatment process with only high pressure swro offers the highest urea recovery the value and use of the product may be limited as it can only be used as a fertilizer on non edible plants to reduce pharmaceutical uptake concerns with some level of salt tolerance the final product value can be increased by recovering urea in a purer form however it ultimately comes at the cost of urea recovery although the loose nf ro configuration provided better urea recovery and reasonable pharmaceutical removal compared to the tight nf ro configuration the purity was significantly lower 56 compared to 85 as the aim of this work was to produce a purer urea product stream the additional treatment cost may not be worth the small improvement in purity the loose nf membrane is advantageous for its higher permeate flux see figure s1 b and it is advised that ion exchanges resins be investigated as a method to replace monovalent ions in urine with divalent ones to improve salt rejection further a detailed economic analysis would be required to determine feasibility based on the end product use and value whilst these scenarios would still need to be tested at a pilot scale level and beyond this study provides a proof of concept for producing different urea streams directly from stabilized urine the advantage of a hybrid nf ro process is that it recovers urea in a purer form other membrane processes such as forwards osmosis fo and membrane distillation md would also result in salts and pharmaceuticals being concentrated along with the nutrients such as with the ro process it is also important to note that as md operates at elevated temperatures fresh or stabilized urine would undergo chemical urea hydrolysis and therefore should not be used if the aim is to recover urea however nf could be used as a pre treatment step before fo or md to also remove salts and pharmaceuticals this would likely also optimize both processes as fouling compound would be removed furthermore in the case of fo as the nf permeate has a lower osmotic pressure the concentration of the draw solution required to achieve a defined flux would not have to be as high ray et al 2020 compared the cost of ammonia recovery for ro nf and fo and found that fo costs 2 to 13 times more than ro and nf depending on the treatment scenario whilst this comparison was for hydrolyzed urine it is likely that the comparative costs would be similar for stabilized urine a detailed economic analysis of the proposed process should be determined in future work though 4 conclusions both a loose nf270 and tight nf90 nf membrane can be used to physically remove pharmaceuticals from stabilized urine at 75 water removal as permeate more than 70 nf270 and 99 nf90 of the pharmaceuticals would be removed and recovered in the brine stream urine pre treatment with tight nf recovered 48 of the urea in the permeate 75 water removal the nf90 pre treatment increased the purity of the urea from 37 to 89 in the permeate removing 90 of the organics and 96 of the ions present in the urine pre treatment with a loose nf270 membrane recovered more urea in the permeate 78 with a 75 water removal however removal of organics and ions was limited to 78 and 44 respectively this resulted in a final urea purity of 56 the nf pre treatment step only purifies the urea and does not significantly concentrate it using the nf90 membrane the total volume was only reduced by 25 and further concentration would still be required to reduce volume and transportation costs the permeate can be further treated with high pressure swro at an overall water removal of 80 the urea recovery would be 32 7 further concentration of the loose nf permeate to 80 overall water removal would increase the overall urea recovery to 52 compared to the tight nf process however this concentrate stream would be less pure 56 purity and contain undesirable salts a decision tree was also developed that can be used to determine the optimal treatment

15648,human urine can be treated and concentrated using reverse osmosis ro but this process also concentrates pharmaceuticals and undesirable salts along with valuable nutrients such as urea the final fertilizer product therefore has limited use on salt sensitive crops or edible crops as the effects of pharmaceuticals remain a concern tight and loose nanofiltration nf pre treatment was investigated as a method to recover urea in the permeate which could then be further concentrated using ro whilst pharmaceuticals and undesirable salts would be removed in the brine both nf options removed pharmaceuticals nf90 99 nf270 70 using a loose nf membrane 78 of the urea was recovered in the permeate 80 water removal however the salt removal was poor 44 and the urea purity only increased from 37 to 56 tight nf membranes provided better rejection of salts and organics 96 and 90 removed respectively the urea purity in the permeate 75 water removal from the tight nf process was 89 however the urea recovered was lower 48 the tight nf permeate was then further concentrated with ro at an overall water removal of 80 32 7 of the urea could be recovered with a purity of 85 a decision tree was also developed to determine the optimum treatment process based on the desired final product this decision tree could be used to determine the economic feasibility of each treatment process based on the final product choice and product value graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fertilizers membranes nitrogen nutrient recovery pharmaceuticals resource recovery 1 introduction significant research has been conducted over the past twenty years investigating the potential of using urine as a sustainable alternative to synthetic fertilizers as well as the processes required to make this feasible larsen et al 2021 important aspects to consider include source separation and urine collection flanagan and randall 2018 gundlach et al 2021 urine derived fertilizer effectivity martin et al 2020 public perception simha et al 2018 stabilization and disinfection herraiz carboné et al 2021 randall et al 2016 transport logistics and economics chipako and randall 2020 and methods for nutrient recovery larsen et al 2021 due to the high water content of urine it is important to either extract the desired fertilizer components or concentrate the urine to reduce the costs associated with transporting the fertilizer product maurer et al 2006 urine should also be stabilized to prevent urea hydrolysis as this allows for maximum nitrogen recovery randall et al 2016 and avoids losses in the collection phase due to ammonia volatilization urine can be stabilized with ca oh 2 which results in the precipitation of calcium phosphate an effective organic fertilizer meyer et al 2018 over 96 of the phosphorus present in urine could be recovered using ca oh 2 stabilization flanagan and randall 2018 reverse osmosis ro has shown promise as a potential treatment method to concentrate unhydrolyzed urine courtney and randall 2022 previous urine membrane filtration research was limited to hydrolyzed urine ek et al 2006 as urea being a small and uncharged compound was difficult to recover in the brine using brackish water ro and nanofiltration nf membranes ray et al 2020 however courtney and randall 2022 showed that using a high pressure seawater ro membrane along with an air bubbling pre treatment step ca oh 2 stabilized urine could be concentrated by at least a factor of 2 5 whilst also recovering 86 of the urea in the brine stream the urine could have theoretically been concentrated even further and was only limited by the scale of the laboratory equipment there are however limitations with a process that only uses ro to concentrate urine for example the majority of pharmaceutically active compounds phacs ingested are excreted via urine lienert et al 2007 and urine also contains many other undesirable salts and organics the rejection properties for high pressure seawater ro membranes result in the majority of salts organics and any phacs present in the urine being concentrated along with the valuable fertilizer nutrients whilst crops fertilized with urine have comparable yields to those treated with synthetic fertilizers pandorf et al 2018 application rates need to be adjusted based on a crop s salt sensitivity to maximize yield mnkeni et al 2008 crop uptake of phacs also requires consideration and any safety concerns could be avoided by limiting urine derived fertilizer use to non food related agriculture such as flower farming however salt tolerance would still need to be considered which could potentially limit the commercial appeal of the urine derived fertilizers a method to recover a purer urea stream that still contains other key fertilizer nutrients could therefore increase the value of the final fertilizer product or be used to produce alternative urea based products marepula et al 2021 whilst advanced oxidation processes ultra violet h2o2 or a combination have shown potential for phac degradation in urine zhang et al 2015 these processes do not remove by products formed during the treatment process physical removal of the phacs such as using granular activated carbon gac köpping et al 2020 would be more robust however gac also absorbs urea and therefore is not a suitable treatment method for stabilized urine where the urea has not degraded pronk et al 2006 observed that nf of unhydrolyzed urine resulted in poor urea rejection 20 whilst phacs were retained in the brine stream they suggested that nf could be used to rather recover urea in the permeate stream nanofiltration membranes are generally classified as either loose or tight membranes schäfer and fane 2021 nanofiltration membranes provide good rejection of divalent ions but they have limited rejection capacity for monovalent ions bergman 2007 however tight nf membranes have shown to have improved rejection capacity for monovalent ions thamaraiselvan et al 2018 tight nf membranes also improve urea rejection 46 58 urea rejection nf90 ray et al 2020 compared to loose nf membrane 10 20 nf270 pronk et al 2006 a loose nf membrane could potentially be used as pre treatment to removal phacs from urine whilst a tight nf membrane could be used to remove undesirable salts in addition to phacs thus resulting in a purer urea product stream however the lower urea recovery in the permeate stream due to the higher rejection capabilities of tight nf membranes would need to be considered the permeate stream could then be concentrated further using seawater ro to produce a concentrated and purified urea product stream the recovery and purity of urea in the permeate will also be affected by the extent of the volume reduction factor vrf amount of water removed as permeate many rejection studies are limited to vrf of 2 5 water removal of 60 at high vrfs the feed becomes increasingly concentrated and there is the potential for concentration polarization which reduces rejection capacity bergman 2007 it is therefore important to assess salt rejection and urea recoveries at high vrfs the aim of this work was therefore to determine if a hybrid nf and ro process could be used to recover urea from urine in a purer form by removing undesirable salts organics and phacs this was achieved by 1 determining the rejection capabilities of loose and tight nf membranes with regards to urea undesirable salts organics and pharmaceuticals 2 comparing how urea and salt rejection is affected as the vrf increases 3 assessing the overall recovery and purity of urea when the nf permeate was further concentrated with a seawater ro membrane 2 materials and methods 2 1 urine collection and preparation all experiments were conducted with urine stabilized with 10 g l 1 ca oh 2 synthetic and real that was pre treated with air bubbling as per the method described by courtney et al 2021 synthetic urine was used to ensure consistent composition between experiments see the supplementary information for the synthetic urine recipe real urine was collected in waterless urinals pre dosed with 10 g l 1 ca oh 2 flanagan and randall 2018 from at least 10 men and women working in the new engineering building at the university of cape town detailed compositions of the real urine are available in table s1 due to collection limitations the real urine composition could not be kept constant across all experiments as not enough urine could be collected at once both real and synthetic urine stabilized with ca oh 2 were then pre treated with air bubbling following the method developed by courtney et al 2021 to remove excess calcium all urine was filtered with 0 45 µm filter paper chm lab group spain after air bubbling and before nanofiltration treatment 2 2 pharmaceutical dosing six different pharmaceuticals three acidic and three basic of varying molecular weight were chosen to compare the rejection capacity of tight and loose nf membranes the properties of each pharmaceutical compound are summarized below in table 1 each pharmaceutical was dosed at 100 mg l 1 whilst this concentration is higher than measured in real urine it was chosen to ensure that at least 99 rejection could be accurately measured based on the method detection limit mdl the phacs are costly and the ones used in this study were all donations the stock of tenofovir and stavudine was unfortunately not sufficient for use in the experiments with real urine 2 3 membranes and equipment setup all experiments were carried out in a laboratory scale cross flow membrane testing unit sepa cf sterlitech usa the effective membrane area was 0 14 m2 the complete membrane filtration equipment consisted of a feed tank that was temperature controlled with a chiller hh 25 jeiotech south korea and water circulation the feed was circulated using a high pressure pump m 03s hydra cell minneapolis usa and the transmembrane pressure was controlled using a pressure control valve the brine flow rate was measured with a flow meter lzt 1002 g 1 7 l min 1 wet technologies strand south africa the permeate stream was collected and continuously weighed on a digital mass balance ps 8100 x 2 radwag poland to determine the permeate flux the pressure pt100r 13 lu2 h1131 turck germany temperature and conductivity mettler toledo usa and ph h1 5221 hanna johannesburg south africa of the permeate and brine was also continuously measured the following filmtec membranes were used nf270 nf90 and sw30 the nf270 is considered a loose nf membrane the nf90 is a tight nf membrane and the sw30 membrane is typically used for seawater desalination 2 4 experimental conditions and methods all membranes were prepared by pre soaking in de ionized water for at least 24 h de ionized water was then circulated through the system at 35 bar 55 bar for the sw30 for at least 2 h to compact the membrane and ensure steady flux the feed flow rate was 6 8 l min 1 maximum feed flow rate advised by equipment supplier which corresponds to a tangential velocity of 1 09 m s 1 this was repeated for the feed solution and a new membrane was used for each experimental run the concentration of pharmaceuticals was measured in the feed solution before and after the circulation period to determine if any adsorption to the membrane had occurred a high operating pressure 35 bar was chosen for the nf membrane experiments to ensure sufficient driving force to overcome the osmotic pressure of urine the effect of membrane operating pressure on urea and ion rejection was investigated and the results are given in the supplementary information for the nf experiments enough permeate was collected to achieve a vrf of 5 80 water removal for the nf270 membrane due to a minimum liquid volume requirement in the feed tank to protect the pump and a vrf of 4 75 water removal for the nf90 membrane due to flux decline caused by the increased concentration of the feed pharmaceutical rejection was analyzed at a vrf of 2 water removal of 50 for consistent comparison the permeate collected from the nf90 real urine experiment was further concentrated using a sw30 membrane at 55 bar due to the poor purification properties of the nf270 membrane it was determined that further concentration of the permeate from these experiments was not feasible both real and synthetic urine was used for each experimental condition to calculate urea purity of a stream the concentration of urea in the stream was first analyzed the water from 100 ml of the stream was evaporated of at 30 c to prevent urea hydrolysis and the mass of dried solids was then weighed a known mass of the dried sample was then re dissolved in de ionized water and the urea was re measured to confirm no hydrolysis had occurred the urea purity was then calculated as the mass of urea as a percentage of the total dissolved solids the concentration of ammonia was less than 1 of the measured ions in all samples tested for purity therefore it was determined that any ammonia loss during drying would not significantly contribute to the urea purity calculations 2 5 analytical methods colorimetric methods were used to determine the concentration of urea total ammoniacal nitrogen tan po4 3 p mg2 ca2 so4 2 cl and k where required this process was automated with a gallery discrete analyzer thermofisher scientific massachusetts using standard methods of the equipment the concentration of sodium was determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry 5900 svdv agilent usa the chemical oxygen demand cod of a sample was measured with medium range reagent vials hi94754b 25 hanna johannesburg and a multiparameter photometer h183399 hanna johannesburg the cod was used as a proxy for the concentration of organics li and liu 2018 removed using membrane filtration all liquid samples were analyzed within 30 min of sampling pharmaceuticals were measured using an agilent 1220 infinity liquid chromatograph agilent technology inc switzerland equipped with an agilent poroshel 120 c18 column 4 3 cm x 50 mm x 2 7 µm chromatographic separations were performed at 35 c using 15 mm phosphate buffer ph 3 25 a and acetonitrile b as mobile phase with gradient elution at a flow rate of 0 8 ml min detection of all the components was carried out at 210 nm and completed within 15 min 3 results and discussion 3 1 pharmaceutical rejection fig 1 compares the rejection of six phacs by the nf90 and nf270 membranes the molecular weight mw of the phacs increases from left to right the tight nf90 membrane provided high rejections of pharmaceuticals 98 while for the nf270 membrane at least 73 of all the phacs were rejected these results were agreeable with those of pronk et al 2006 for phacs with similar mws tenofovir appeared to have degraded in the synthetic stabilized urine ph 7 0 which could explain the high rejection 99 achieved in comparison to the other two acidic pharmaceuticals which had lower rejections compared to the basic compounds for the nf270 membrane although tenofovir was not present for the real urine experiments it is likely that a similar high rejection would have been observed for the nf270 there was no observable trend between rejection and mw there was no significant difference in the concentrations of the pharmaceuticals before and after membrane equilibration it is therefore unlikely that significant membrane adsorption occurred it is likely that other membrane characteristics such as surface charge and solution ph played a role in rejection pronk et al 2006 showed that for basic compounds rejection decreases with increasing ph due to increased absorption of the positively charged compound to the negatively charged membrane with the reverse occurring for acidic compounds real urine dosed with phacs has a ph of 8 0 compared to 7 0 for synthetic urine which would explain why the rejection of basic compounds was lower in real urine compared to synthetic urine it is likely that a similar trend would have been observed with stavudine in real urine these aspects should be investigated further in future work though alternatively rejection may be influenced by differences in the osmotic pressure of real and synthetic urine caused by the rejection of organics pronk et al 2006 in general both the nf90 and nf270 membrane are suitable for the removal of a broad spectrum of phacs 3 2 urea purification using nanofiltration to determine if a purer urea stream could be recovered from urine using nf the urea ion and cod rejection were measured as a function of volume reduction factor vrf shown in fig 2 where vrf is the ratio of the starting volume to the brine volume remaining urea typically consists of 37 4 of the tds in urine this will vary based on urine composition for the loose nf270 membrane urea rejection was low less than 10 and decreased further as more permeate was recovered the rejection rates for real and synthetic urine were in a similar range to those achieved by pronk et al 2006 using the same membrane for the synthetic urine experiments 77 6 of the urea was recovered in the permeate at an 80 water removal flux decline due to fouling was observed for real urine as such only 75 of the water could be recovered as permeate however the urea recovery in the permeate is comparable with synthetic urine fig 2b rejection of monovalent ions by the nf270 membrane was poor 55 which can be observed by the high conductivity in the permeate 6 12 ms cm 1 as shown in fig 2c rejection of ions was comparable for real and synthetic urine the differences in permeate conductivity are due to the differences in initial conductivity of the two streams the nf270 provided 70 rejection of organic compounds measured as cod at a vrf of 4 46 of the ions and 78 of the cod was removed this increased the urea purity from 37 to 56 the urea rejection rates for the tight nf90 membrane were higher than for the nf270 membrane and decreased with increasing permeate recovery these results agreed with those of ray et al 2020 who observed a urea rejection of approximately 55 for real fresh urine at a vrf of 1 1 urea rejection by the nf90 membrane increased significantly 20 between synthetic and real urine pronk et al 2006 hypothesized that this phenomenon could be attributed to the formation of organic matrices that increased the size of urea and thus increased rejection the nf90 provided high rejection of ions resulting in a permeate conductivity of 0 6 ms cm 1 for real urine fig 2c rejection of cod was greater than 95 at a water removal permeate of 75 for real urine 48 of the urea was recovered 90 of the cod was removed and 97 of the ions were removed resulting in increased urea purity from 37 to 89 concentrating the nf permeate stream using swro membranes would further decrease the recovery of urea since approximately 14 of the total urea is lost using a swro membrane courtney and randall 2022 due to the poor rejection of salts by the nf270 membrane only further concentration of the nf90 permeate using ro was investigated however the nf270 membrane is advantageous as it has a higher permeate flux and lower urea rejection compared to the nf90 membrane this results in a smaller nf setup being required and increased urea recovery in the permeate however the low rejection of monovalent ions 55 compared to 80 for divalent ions does not significantly improve the urea purity replacement of monovalent ions with divalent ions using ion exchange resins would increase their rejection and thus result in a purer urea stream hilal et al 2015a exchanged up to 80 of the chloride ions with sulfate ions depending on dose and contact time in seawater hilal et al 2015b further observed that permeate flux using an nf90 membrane increased from 4 to 11 l m 2 h 1 after seawater was treated with ion exchange an ion exchange pre treatment step should therefore be further investigated for this integrated urine treatment process 3 3 further concentration of nf permeate using ro whilst nf can be used to improve the purity of urine by removing organics undesirable salts and phacs these membranes do not sufficiently reduce the volume of the stream further concentration using ro is therefore still required for transportation of the final product to be economically feasible the nf90 permeate from real urine was further concentrated to a volume reduction factor of 2 5 and the urea rejection was monitored fig 3 a the vrf was limited due to the volume of permeate available and the minimum liquid volume required in the feed tank the relationship between vrf and urea rejection was then used to predict urea recovery and purity if the permeate was concentrated beyond a vrf of 2 5 fig 3b rejection of urea for both real and synthetic permeate was consistent this was expected as the majority of organics present in real urine are removed during the nf pre treatment and can therefore no longer influence urea rejection as hypothesized by pronk et al 2006 higher urea rejection by the nf90 membrane for real urine compared to synthetic urine results in lower urea recovery in the permeate and therefore lower overall recovery as the permeate is further concentrated using swro the purity of synthetic urine was also slightly higher than real urine due to the simplified concentration of organics used in the synthetic urine recipe it is advised that overall water removal for the hybrid nf ro system should be limited to 80 since above this both urea purity and recovery decrease substantially fig 4 gives a summary mass balance for the tight nf ro process with an overall volume reduction of 80 the final concentrated liquid fertilizer would have a urea purity of 89 with an overall urea recovery of 32 7 in comparison to a different process to recover and purify urea from urine marepula et al 2021 used an evaporation and ethanol purification process and was able to recover a dry product which contained 67 of the original urea with a purity of 76 in addition there is still considerable urea in the nf concentrate stream that could also be further treated to recover more urea as the nf brine still contains the majority of organics further treatment with a membrane process forward osmosis membrane distillation or ro would likely result in fouling further concentration with a process such as evaporation or freeze concentration would be suitable as these processes are not affected by fouling a process such as the one developed by marepula et al 2021 could also be used as there is a much smaller volume of water to remove by evaporation this would increase the overall urea recovery to at least 67 a freeze concentration process such as the one developed by noe hays et al 2021 could also be used their process treated hydrolyzed urine and achieved a nitrogen recovery of 92 with a vrf of 5 8 however since this process treated hydrolyzed urine it is unclear what the urea recovery would be if stabilized urine was treated with a freeze concentration process whilst almost 68 of the urea would be lost using a nf ro treatment process this process cannot be directly compared to studies that investigated nutrient recovery from hydrolyzed or fresh non stabilized urine as many of these previous studies did not account for n lost through ammonia volatilization during the urine collection or storage phase an analysis of at least 10 studies using hydrolyzed urine estimated that the n losses due to volatilization could range anywhere from 0 44 see section 2 3 in the supplementary information nitrogen loss from non stabilized urine will vary significantly depending on collection

recover nutrients will vary depending on the desired end product and its use a decision tree is shown in fig 5 that can be used to decide which membrane treatment option to use whilst a treatment process with only high pressure swro offers the highest urea recovery the value and use of the product may be limited as it can only be used as a fertilizer on non edible plants to reduce

15649,in recent decades the reclamation of lakes has captured 42 of the total lake area of the yangtze plain in china and introduced additional pressure on lacustrine water quality while lacustrine dissolved organic matter dom is critical in regulating biogeochemical processing and aquatic biodiversity the impact of reclamation on the molecular level characteristics of lacustrine dom remains unexplored here the dom characteristics altered by reclamation practices in the yangtze plain lakes were investigated using fluorescence spectroscopy nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry results demonstrated that reclamation not only elevated the quantity on average 32 but also altered the characteristics and composition of lacustrine dom compared to the natural water sites close by reclamation sites did not significantly alter the dom aromaticity but significantly lowered the average molecular weight and increased the biolability of dom the chromophoric dom and humic like fluorescent components were remarkably elevated but not the protein like fluorescent components more lipid like and condensed aromatic like components were detected in the lacustrine dom as compared to the lignin like carbohydrate like and protein like components which may be driven by the increased microbial processing overall the

the area of aquaculture zones in this region rose from 1102 km2 in 1973 to 3429 km2 in 2018 hou et al 2020 dissolved organic matter dom is one of the most active and mobile carbon pools and plays an important role in global biogeochemistry and greenhouse gas emissions herzsprung et al 2017 wang et al 2020b additionally the quantity and quality of dom are critical to water quality since it serves as an important precursor to disinfection byproducts dbps introduced to the water supply li et al 2020 phungsai et al 2018 chen et al 2020 several studies have started investigating the effects of reclamation from natural water to dry land and how the process affects the organic matter chemistry chantigny 2003 li et al 2018 for instance he et al 2014 found that the conversion of an aquatic ecosystem into a terrestrial ecosystem increased the amount of total carbon and nitrogen as well as the fraction of carbohydrate and phenol in soil organic matter wang et al 2010 reported that reclamation of land from a wetland significantly elevated the amount of soil labile organic carbon levels however bai and his coworkers claimed that the conversion from natural coastal wetland to cropland led to a significant decrease in soil organic carbon bai et al 2013 such inconsistent conclusions might result from a variety of factors such as differences in tillage regimes cultivation practices physicochemical properties of soil and reclamation stages khorramdel et al 2013 although how reclamation from natural water to dry land affects organic matter chemistry has been explored there is still inadequate information on how reclamation from natural water to an aquaculture zone would alter the dom quantity and quality a few studies have shown that aquaculture effluents released large quantities of readily bioavailable carbohydrates protein and lipids in dom to nearby waterbody kamjunke et al 2017 wang et al 2021a and coastal aquaculture derived dom in jeju island contained more humic like organics with higher molecular weight kim et al 2022 however it is still unclear how the reclamation from natural water to aquaculture zone alters the composition and characteristics of lacustrine dom reclamation from a natural water body to an aquaculture zone results in the increased levels of dom and an altered environmental quality camino serrano et al 2014 xie et al 2017 a recent study on the 112 large lakes on the yangtze river plain showed that the dom and nutrient concentrations could be significantly elevated in reclaimed sites compared to their respective nearby natural waters hou et al 2020 several studies also reported that effluents from land based aquaculture were enriched with quantities of dom inorganic nutrients and protein like dom fluorophores characterized by fluorescence spectroscopy compared to natural streams nimptsch et al 2015 ryan et al 2022 still the shifts in the molecular level characteristics of the lacustrine dom in aquaculture zones after reclamation remain largely unknown notably the alteration in the dom chemistry due to reclamation from natural water to aquaculture zones may alter the reactivity towards dbp formation and the resulting compounds could pose potential threats to drinking water safety fang et al 2021 since the yangtze river serves as a water source for one third of china s population 0 5 billion people fang et al 2021 wang et al 2017 lacustrine dom in the yangtze river plain is of great concern regarding the potential risk to public health the goal of this study is to unveil the influence of lake reclamation on molecular level characteristics e g aromaticity molecular size and composition of lacustrine dom we examined the variation in spectroscopic and molecular level characteristics of lacustrine dom with or without the impact of lake reclamation by combining the complementary analyses of fluorescence spectroscopy solution state nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectroscopy ft icr ms for a comprehensive understanding of lacustrine dom principal component analysis pca was adopted to reveal the inter relationship between various dom characteristics results from this study will provide a better understanding of the alteration in lacustrine dom characteristics by lake reclamation and insights for the future water management of reclaimed lakes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yangtze plain is located in the middle and lower basins of the yangtze river 28 50 33 50 n 113 30 121 00 e wang et al 2012 which has the most abundant area of freshwater lakes in china with 696 lakes larger than one km2 wang et al 2014 the yangtze plain lakes are intensively affected by two major types of reclamation one is physical development from natural water to agricultural built up lands and the other is reclamation from natural water to aquaculture zones camino serrano et al 2014 xie et al 2017 although aquaculture zones are still covered with water they are generally separated from the main lakes and are mostly used for fisheries and crab cultivation hou et al 2020 2 2 field water sampling in this study reclamation sites rs and natural water sites nw from nine large lakes namely dongtinghu dth futouhu fth guchenghu gch honghu hh nanyihu nyh shijiuhu sjh taihu th tangxunhu txh and yangchenghu ych on the yangtze plain were investigated fig 1 the detailed locations and information of each sampling point are shown in fig s1 table s1 the sampling campaign was implemented in april 2019 and the surface water samples 0 5 m were simultaneously collected from both the rs and the respective nw within 30 min using acid washed glass bottle samplers prerinsed with the water sample in triplicates it is worth noting that the rs samples were all from the aquaculture zones and not the agricultural built up lands at each site more than 4 l of water sample was collected at a water depth of 0 20 cm and then stored in pre washed amber bottles in the dark which were immediately delivered to the laboratory in ice all samples were filtered through 0 7 μm glass fiber filters pre combusted at 450 c for 4

intellical phc201 ph probe hach usa approximately 20 ml of filtered samples were acidified using 6 m hcl and then dissolved organic carbon doc and total dissolved nitrogen tdn concentrations were determined using a total organic carbon analyzer toc l csh csn shimadzu japan equipped with an asi l autosampler ye et al 2019 the no2 concentration in the filtered sample was analyzed on an auto

an ultraviolet spectrophotometer tu 1810 persee china following the salicylic acid and ammonium molybdate method federation and association 2005 dissolved organic nitrogen don was calculated as the difference between total and inorganic nitrogen concentrations all filtered water samples were analyzed using an ultraviolet visible and fluorescence spectrometer aqualog horiba japan to obtain the absorbance spectra and fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems ye et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 the excitation wavelengths were set to change gradually from 550 to 241 nm in 3 nm increments while the emission scans were made from 246 to 828 nm with approximately 1 nm interval all eems were corrected for blanks instrument related and inner filter effects and further normalized to the raman unit murphy et al 2010 the absorption coefficient at 350 nm a350 was calculated to quantify the abundance of chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom spencer et al 2013 wang et al 2021c the spectroscopic indices were calculated to characterize the dom the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 in l mg c m an indicator for dom aromaticity was calculated by dividing absorbance values at 254 nm a254 by the doc concentration weishaar et al 2003 the fluorescence index fi a descriptor of the dom source approximately 1 8 microbial origin approximately 1 2 terrestrial source was calculated as the ratio of the fluorescence intensity at em 470 nm to that at 520 nm when excitation wavelength was 370 nm cory and mcknight 2005 the biological index bix a metric for the contribution of newly produced autochthonous dom content was calculated as the ratio of emission intensity at 380 nm to the maximum emission intensity between 420 and 435 nm when the excitation wavelength was 310 nm wilson and xenopoulos 2008 parallel factor analysis parafac was used to decompose the eems into different fluorescent dom fdom components murphy et al 2013 and the model was validated based on the split half analysis stedmon and bro 2008 all components were further compared to the previously reported models in the openfluor database murphy et al 2014 a six component model was finally established and the fluorescence intensity at the maximum fmax for each component was quantified murphy et al 2013 a solution state 1h nmr analysis was utilized to obtain general structural information about dom in lake water samples method s1 approximately 800 ml of composited filtered water samples were freeze dried using 1 l high density polyethylene bottles nalgene then approximately 5 mg of dried sample was resuspended in 500 μl of deuterium oxide d2o and titrated to ph 14 using naod to ensure complete solubility before analysis with a bruker biospin avance iii 500 mhz nmr spectrometer karlsruhe germany the 1h nmr spectra were obtained using pre saturation utilizing relaxation gradients and echoes for resonance inhibition simpson and brown 2005 spectra were apodised through multiplication with an exponential decay corresponding to 2 0 hz line broadening and a zero filling factor of two simpson and brown 2005 four regions were integrated from the one dimensional 1h nmr spectra which included 1 materials derived from linear terpenoids mdlt 0 6 1 6 ppm 2 carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules cram 1 6 3 2 ppm 3 carbohydrates and peptides carb 3 2 4 5 ppm and 4 aromatics and phenolics arom 6 5 8 4 ppm lam et al 2007 to obtain molecular level insights into the impact of lake reclamation on the formula composition of dom we further analyzed the samples by ft icr ms the detailed method is provided in method s2 in supporting information wang et al 2021b zhou et al 2021 the elemental formula was assigned to each monoisotopic mass using formularity software tolic et al 2017 with constraints of c0 100h0 200o0 50n0 10s0 2 h c 2 5 o c 1 2 n c 0 5 and s c 0 2 koch and dittmar 2006 double bond equivalents dbe and the modified aromaticity index aimod were calculated to evaluate the unsaturation degree and aromaticity of each compound respectively koch and dittmar 2006 2016 in addition the molecular lability boundary for more labile contributions mlbl was calculated as described previously lechtenfeld et al 2014 the abundance weighted average of formulae within the island of stability ios was defined as formulae with 1 04 h c 1 3 0 42 o c 0 62 and 332 m z 388 or 446 m z 548 lechtenfeld et al 2014 intensity weighted methods were applied to calculate the average molecular weight mw dbe aimod and h c and o c ratios seven biochemical groups were assigned following the classification method wu et al 2018 with small modifications which include 1 lipid like 0 o c 0 2 1 5 h c 2 3 n c 0 04 and s 0 2 protein like 0 2 o c 0 52 1 5 h c 2 2 and 0 178 n c 0 44 3 amino sugar like 0 52 o c 0

and 7 tannin like compounds 0 67 o c 0 97 0 53 h c 1 5 and s 0 the relative abundances of different biochemical groups were determined as the ratio of their signals to the total signal of all assigned formulae the percentage change of component i in dom in rs relative to nw δmass i was roughly estimated as shown below eq 1 based on the assumption that the total quantity of components was approximately in proportion to the quantity of dissolved organic carbon wang et al 2020a 1 δ mass i m do c rs p i rs m do c nw p i nw 1 100 where m docnw and m docrs are the doc concentrations in mg l in nw and rs respectively and p i nw and p i rs are the relative abundances of component i in dom in in nw and rs respectively to compare the mass formulas of nw and rs in each lake the mass peaks that were present in both nw and rs were named as common presence data while those that were only present either in nw or rs were different presence data herzsprung et al 2012 the results of common presence and different presence were depicted using van krevelen diagrams 2 4 data processing and statistical analyses to avoid the possible bias of different site numbers from different lakes we used the average parameters of each lake for statistical analysis so that each lake would have the same weight differences in the general water quality e g doc and don values spectroscopic indices e g suva fi and bix components in 1h nmr spectra and characteristics indicated by ft icr ms were analyzed using spss v20 il a paired sample t test was conducted to compare the difference in dom composition with and without reclamation alternatively the nonparametric wilcoxon signed ranks test was employed if the parameters did not satisfy the assumptions of a t test significant difference was set at a level of p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 elevated doc concentrations with reclamation doc concentrations were significantly higher in rs than in nw across all the lake samples p 0 01 fig 2 a the average doc concentrations of nine lakes in nw and rs were 3 3 and 4 2 mg l respectively the percentage change of doc in rs relative to nw ranged from 11 to 120 and the average value was 32 fig 2a in the reclaimed aquacultural zones although most of the organic rich feed is consumed by fish shrimp and crab approximately 30 of the feed could be retained in the water bodies herbeck et al 2013 the residual feed and the biological excrement from aquatic organisms after decomposition is likely an important source of organic matter and could explain the increase of doc with reclamation cripps and bergheim 2000 such increases in the doc are also consistent with the recent finding that the rs consistently had a higher light absorbing capacity than the nw nearby based on the remote sensing techniques hou et al 2020 although the doc concentrations were significantly higher in rs than nw there was no significant difference in the don concentrations between rs and nw p 0 664 fig 2b 3 2 elevated humic like fdom and relatively stable protein like fdom with reclamation significant alterations in spectroscopic indices of lacustrine dom by lake reclamation are illustrated in fig 2c 2f there was no significant difference in suva or bix of the lacustrine dom between rs and nw for all samples p 0 08 fig 2d f the fi values were significantly higher in rs than in nw across all samples indicating that dom derived from phytoplankton and microbes increased with lake reclamation p 0 02 fig 2e the cdom indicated by a350 was more abundant with reclamation p 0 01 and increased by 28 on average in rs relative to nw fig 2c which is comparable to the increase of bulk dom indicated by doc concentrations 32 fig 2a pearson s correlation analysis table s2 indicated that a350 correlated well with doc concentrations r 0 62 p 0 01 this result suggested that the increase of cdom was mainly attributed to the increase in the absolute quantity of bulk dom parafac modeling is a rapid tool to reveal fdom components six different fdom components including three humic like c1 c2 and c3 and three protein like components c4 c5 and c6 were identified fig 3 a the detailed description of each component is summarized in table s2 the sum fmax of six components σfmax the indicator of the abundance of total fdom was 21 higher in rs than in nw across all samples p 0 05 fig 3b furthermore the impact of reclamation on the fmax was found to be dependent on the component for instance the lake reclamation marginally increased the abundance of total humic like fdom c1 c2 and c3 p 0 06 by 36 on average but did not significantly alter the abundance of total protein like fdom c4 c5 and c6 p 0 28 within the humic like fdom the microbial humic like fdom c1 had a greater increase by 38 than the terrestrial humic like i c2 and ii c3 fdom 31 and 36 respectively interestingly the abundances of total protein like fdom such as tyrosine and tryptophan c4 c5 and c6 in both nw and rs of th and ych were remarkably higher than those in other lakes fig 3b since the th i e taihu lake suffered from severe eutrophication in the past few years the metabolism of algal blooms is likely responsible for the higher percentage of total protein like substances this result was supported by previously reported findings that dom in the th was dominated by protein like components which accounted for 85 of total fluorescence intensity cai et al 2019 murphy et al 2008 wang et al 2020b similarly the ych i e yangchenghu lake a typical aquaculture lake for intensive crab breeding liu et al 2019 contained abundant nutrients from residual crab bait which accelerated the massive growth of microorganisms and led to a higher abundance of protein like fdom than other lakes studied regardless of reclamation fig 3b 3 3 elevated levels of carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules and materials derived from linear terpenoids with reclamation 1h nmr analyses were used to further clarify the impact of reclamation on the chemical characteristics of lacustrine dom in different lakes the relative percentage of each dom component decreased in the order of carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules cram 35 43 materials derived from linear terpenoids mdlt 29 36 carbohydrates and peptides carb 21 33 aromatics and phenolics arom 1 3 for all samples fig 4 b e this result aligned with the predominance of cram over carbohydrates and aromatics in a prior study that characterized lake dom composition using 1h nmr analyses cao et al 2018 taking the doc concentration into account lake reclamation significantly increased the cram by 34 on average ranging from 9 to 125 p 0 03 and mdlt by 26 on average ranging from 15 to 85 p 0 04 but did not significantly alter the contents of aromatics and phenolics p 0 09 and carbohydrates and peptides p 0 09 fig 4f differently a previous study found that land based salmon aquacultures had an increased abundance of carbohydrates and peptides in effluent dom compared to that in the control sites kamjunke et al 2017 this result might be because salmon aquacultures had strikingly higher doc concentration 1 5 4 2 mg c l than the control site 0 2 0 4 mg c l and could release large quantities of bioavailable metabolites e g carbohydrates and peptides nevertheless according to prior studies a significant portion of cram is microbial derived lechtenfeld et al 2015 and the higher cram components with reclamation were consistent with the increased microbial production indicated by elevated abundances of microbial humic like fdom fig 3b and fi values fig 2e moreover since mdlt is composed primarily of aliphatic molecules that are likely derived from conjugated terpenoid molecules such as carotenoids found in terrestrial and aquatic biomass lam et al 2007 the higher mdlt values suggested more aliphatic compounds in dom with lake reclamation 3 4 identifying molecular features with reclamation the average molecular weight mw values of dom were significantly lower in rs than nw across all samples p 0 03 table 1 the lower mw in rs was possibly attributed to the stronger leaching of low molecular weight dom because of the elevated microbial decomposition of lacustrine dom li et al 2020 the reclaimed lakes had substantially higher mlbl values than those of dom in nw p 0 02 the ios ranged from 5 6 to 12 5 and showed a lower ios in rs p 0 05 since mlbl had a positive correlation with dom lability d andrilli et al 2015 lechtenfeld et al 2014 and ios was reversely correlated with dom lability the elevated mlbl values and decreased ios collectively demonstrated that reclamation significantly increased the dom lability the dom was classified into seven biochemical groups based on the molecular formulas assigned to individual mass spectral peaks figs 5 s2 the lacustrine dom was dominated by lignin like compounds 70 fig s2a followed by tannin like 2 6 fig s2b lipid like 1 10 fig 5a and condensed aromatic like compounds 1 2 fig s2c the dominance of lignin like components was also observed in other lacustrine dom characterized using ft icr ms kellerman et al 2014 the relative abundance of lignin like components was significantly lower in rs than in nw p 0 007 since lignin originates mainly from the cell walls of vascular plants and is a major residual component of decomposed terrestrial plants kalbitz et al 2000 the lower abundance of lignin like components in rs agrees with the lower contribution of terrestrial origins indicated by higher fi values in fig 2e taking the amount of dom concentration into consideration the percentage changes of each biochemical component were estimated in fig 5e based on the estimations the lake reclamation was found to significantly increase the contents of lipid like components by 149 on average ranging from 16 to 533 p 0 04 and condensed aromatics like components by 93 on average ranging from 17 to 357 p 0 03 but did not significantly alter the contents of lignin like p 0 08 and tannin like p 0 22 amino sugar like p 0 13 carbohydrate like p 0 12 and protein like p 0 11 components the higher estimated percentage changes of the lipid compounds with reclamation contributed to the higher lability indicated by increased mlbl values table 1 the increase in microbial derived lipid like components with reclamation was supported by the increased microbial production indicated by fi values fig 2e the conversion of lignin to condensed aromatics via hydroxyl radical initiated oxidation will consume more lignin and accumulate more condensed aromatics this may explain the lower relative abundance of lignin like components and higher proportion of condensed aromatic like components with lake reclamation waggoner et al 2015 besides the extended evaluation of the different presence of components revealed dissimilarities between nw and rs in each lake fig s3 significant differences between nw and rs were observed particularly in dth and hh lakes specifically more aliphatic components appeared in rs of dth lake and this was consistent with the increased mdlt content which is composed primarily of aliphatic molecules with reclamation in dth fig 4f besides less oxygen rich and relatively unsaturated components were contained in rs of hh lake and this was supported by the significantly lower dbe value in rs than in nw in hh lake 3 5 linking multiple characteristics by principal component analysis pca conducted on dom characteristics showed that principal component 1 pc1 and principal component 2 pc2 explained 33 8 and 26 5 of the total variance respectively pearson s correlation analysis is displayed in table s2 the bix c5 c6 carbohydrates and peptides carb and condensed aromatics like components had positive loadings on pc1 while lignin like tannin like and cram exhibited negative pc1 loadings fig 6 a this suggests that pc1 was associated with more freshly produced fluorescent protein like fluorescent components microbial derived lipid like condensed aromatics like and carbohydrates and peptides fractions in dom by contrast pc2 can be explained by high doc content humic like fluorescent components and more biolabile components since doc c1 c2 c3 amino sugar like and protein like compounds were placed on the positive side of pc2 fig 6a distinct from other lakes the th and ych were more clustered at the positive side of pc1 regardless of reclamation indicating that dom in these two lakes contained higher microbial derived protein and lipid like components than those in other lakes this result corresponds with the prior eem parafac data on these samples showing the significantly higher protein like components in dom fig 3b as mentioned before th is a large shallow eutrophic lake with frequent recurrences of cyanobacteria qin et al 2018 while ych is famous for intensive crab breeding in southeast china and has large quantities of residual bait inputs and significant algal bloom liu et al 2019 these may be the reasons for the high microbial derived components in the two lakes even though the lacustrine dom in nw varied greatly between the lakes the consistently increased pc2 scores with reclamation for almost all lakes except txh fig 6b demonstrated that reclamation did significantly alter the lacustrine dom characteristics this result suggested that reclamation tends to increase the abundances of bulk dom cdom and humic like fdom particularly microbial derivatives as well as the lipids e g mdlt and cram and condensed aromatics and decrease the average molecular weight of dom in txh i e tangxunhu lake the bulk dom 10 fig 2a cdom 7 fig 2c humic like fdom 4 fig 3b and microbial humic like 7 fig 3b were not significantly altered by reclamation as compared to other lakes this was probably due to the policy of control of algae by planktivorous fish implemented in txh du et al 2021 in this policy large quantities of planktivorous fish e g silver carp and bighead carp were put into the aquacultural zones in txh to regulate algal bloom biomass leading to the rapid reduction of microbial derived dom yi et al 2016 furthermore less feed and fertilizer was suggested with this policy resulting in less bulk dom input into txh overall this may explain why txh is less affected by reclamation than other lakes 4 conclusions the results of this study suggest that there was considerable diversity in dom characteristics and composition between rs and nearby nw from multiple lakes along the yangtze river the lacustrine dom quantity rose significantly in the reclaimed aquacultural zones possibly because of the increased anthropogenic inputs of feeds and the subsequential dom contributions of algae microbes and other aquatic organisms e g fish shrimp and crab the characteristics and composition of dom were altered significantly by reclamation specifically cdom humic like fdom lipids condensed aromatics and biolabile components indicated by mlbl were increased by 28 36 149 93 and 20 on average respectively while the molecular weight was remarkably decreased from 360 da in nw to 356 da in rs there could be some possible environmental consequences of lake reclamation based on the results of this study for instance increased doc and a smaller molecular weight of dom from reclamation found in this study are expected to lead to a higher production of toxic dbp which may pose potential threats to the water safety for millions of people who are living around the yangtze plain furthermore a higher doc level and biolability altered by reclamation may contribute to greater emissions of greenhouse gasses as dom can fuel or prime microbial processes nevertheless the above speculations concerning the effect of reclamation on dbp production as well as greenhouse gas emissions remain unclear and require more efforts in future studies to elucidate the linkages among reclamation water quality and global warming declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

15649,in recent decades the reclamation of lakes has captured 42 of the total lake area of the yangtze plain in china and introduced additional pressure on lacustrine water quality while lacustrine dissolved organic matter dom is critical in regulating biogeochemical processing and aquatic biodiversity the impact of reclamation on the molecular level characteristics of lacustrine dom remains unexplored here the dom characteristics altered by reclamation practices in the yangtze plain lakes were investigated using fluorescence spectroscopy nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry results demonstrated that reclamation not only elevated the quantity on average 32 but also altered the characteristics and composition of lacustrine dom compared to the natural water sites close by reclamation sites did not significantly alter the dom aromaticity but significantly lowered the average molecular weight and increased the biolability of dom the chromophoric dom and humic like fluorescent components were remarkably elevated but not the protein like fluorescent components more lipid like and condensed aromatic like components were detected in the lacustrine dom as compared to the lignin like carbohydrate like and protein like components which may be driven by the increased microbial processing overall the significant alteration in characteristics and composition of lacustrine dom highlights the potential impact of reclamation on the dom biogeochemical cycle and the environmental quality in aquatic ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords lake reclamation lacustrine dissolved organic matter dom characteristics and composition fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass

fuels deforestation and land use changes have resulted in drastic changes in natural ecosystems wang et al 2010 lake reclamation one of the prominent examples of land use changes has drawn increasing attention as it can significantly alter land use types and ecosystem functions hou et al 2020 reclamation has led to a loss of more than 50 of natural wetlands globally since the 20th century hou et al 2020 and the highest rate of loss has occurred in asia davidson 2014 china has experienced massive reclamation of lakes into land or aquaculture zone since the late 1950s donchyts et al 2016 for example since the 1970s approximately 42 6057 km2 of the total lake area in the yangtze plain has been reclaimed for aquaculture zones and agricultural or built up lands hou et al 2020 in particular the area of aquaculture zones in this region rose from 1102 km2 in 1973 to 3429 km2 in 2018 hou et al 2020 dissolved organic matter dom is one of the most active and mobile carbon pools and plays an important role in global biogeochemistry and greenhouse gas emissions herzsprung et al 2017 wang et al 2020b additionally the quantity and quality of dom are critical to water quality since it serves as an important precursor to disinfection byproducts dbps introduced to the water supply li et al 2020 phungsai et al 2018 chen et al 2020 several studies have started investigating the effects of reclamation from natural water to dry land and how the process affects the organic matter chemistry chantigny 2003 li et al 2018 for instance he et al 2014 found that the conversion of an aquatic ecosystem into a terrestrial ecosystem increased the amount of total carbon and nitrogen as well as the fraction of carbohydrate and phenol in soil organic matter wang et al 2010 reported that reclamation of land from a wetland significantly elevated the amount of soil labile organic carbon levels however bai and his coworkers claimed that the conversion from natural coastal wetland to cropland led to a significant decrease in soil organic carbon bai et al 2013 such inconsistent conclusions might result from a variety of factors such as differences in tillage regimes cultivation practices physicochemical properties of soil and reclamation stages khorramdel et al 2013 although how reclamation from natural water to dry land affects organic matter chemistry has been explored there is still inadequate information on how reclamation from natural water to an aquaculture zone would alter the dom quantity and quality a few studies have shown that aquaculture effluents released large quantities of readily bioavailable carbohydrates protein and lipids in dom to nearby waterbody kamjunke et al 2017 wang et al 2021a and coastal aquaculture derived dom in jeju island contained more humic like organics with higher molecular weight kim et al 2022 however it is still unclear how the reclamation from natural water to aquaculture zone alters the composition and characteristics of lacustrine dom reclamation from a natural water body to an aquaculture zone results in the increased levels of dom and an altered environmental quality camino serrano et al 2014 xie et al 2017 a recent study on the 112 large lakes on the yangtze river plain showed that the dom and nutrient concentrations could be significantly elevated in reclaimed sites compared to their respective nearby natural waters hou et al 2020 several studies also reported that effluents from land based aquaculture were enriched with quantities of dom inorganic nutrients and protein like dom fluorophores characterized by fluorescence spectroscopy compared to natural streams nimptsch et al 2015 ryan et al 2022 still the shifts in the molecular level characteristics of the lacustrine dom in aquaculture zones after reclamation remain largely unknown notably the alteration in the dom chemistry due to reclamation from natural water to aquaculture zones may alter the reactivity towards dbp formation and the resulting compounds could pose potential threats to drinking water safety fang et al 2021 since the yangtze river serves as a water source for one third of china s population 0 5 billion people fang et al 2021 wang et al 2017 lacustrine dom in the yangtze river plain is of great concern regarding the potential risk to public health the goal of this study is to unveil the influence of lake reclamation on molecular level characteristics e g aromaticity molecular size and composition of lacustrine dom we examined the variation in spectroscopic and molecular level characteristics of

water management of reclaimed lakes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yangtze plain is located in the middle and lower basins of the yangtze river 28 50 33 50 n 113 30 121 00 e wang et al 2012 which has the most abundant area of freshwater lakes in china with 696 lakes larger than one km2 wang et al 2014 the yangtze plain lakes are intensively affected by two major types of reclamation one is physical development from natural water to agricultural built up lands and the other is reclamation from natural water to aquaculture zones camino serrano et al 2014 xie et al 2017 although aquaculture zones are still covered with water they are generally separated from the main lakes and are mostly used for fisheries and crab cultivation hou et al 2020 2 2 field water sampling in this study reclamation sites rs and natural water sites nw from nine large lakes namely dongtinghu dth futouhu fth guchenghu gch honghu hh nanyihu nyh shijiuhu sjh taihu th tangxunhu txh and yangchenghu ych on the yangtze plain were investigated fig 1 the detailed locations and information of each sampling point are shown in fig s1 table s1 the sampling campaign was implemented in april 2019 and the surface water samples 0 5 m were simultaneously collected from both the rs and the respective nw within 30 min using acid washed glass bottle samplers prerinsed with the water sample in triplicates it is worth noting that the rs samples were all from the aquaculture zones and not the agricultural built up lands at each site more than 4 l of water sample was collected at a water depth of 0 20 cm and then stored in pre washed amber bottles in the dark which were immediately delivered to the laboratory in ice all samples were filtered through 0 7 μm glass fiber filters pre combusted at 450 c for 4 5 h and stored at 4 c before further analysis within 7 days 2 3 water quality and dom characterization the ph values of the samples were measured using a hq440d benchtop meter equipped with an intellical phc201 ph probe hach usa approximately 20 ml of filtered samples were acidified using 6 m hcl and then dissolved organic carbon doc and total dissolved nitrogen tdn concentrations were determined using a total organic carbon analyzer toc l csh csn shimadzu japan equipped with an asi l autosampler ye et al 2019 the no2 concentration in the filtered sample was analyzed on an auto discrete analyzer cleverchem 380 dechem tech germany while the no3 concentration was measured using the cadmium reduction method federation and association 2005 the nh4 concentration was determined by an ultraviolet spectrophotometer tu 1810 persee china following the salicylic acid and ammonium molybdate method federation and association 2005 dissolved organic nitrogen don was calculated as the difference between total and inorganic nitrogen concentrations all filtered water samples were analyzed using an ultraviolet visible and fluorescence spectrometer aqualog horiba japan to obtain the absorbance spectra and fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems ye et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 the excitation wavelengths were set to change gradually from 550 to 241 nm in 3 nm increments while the emission scans were made from 246 to 828 nm with approximately 1 nm interval all eems were corrected for blanks instrument related and inner filter effects and further normalized to the raman unit murphy et al 2010 the absorption coefficient at 350 nm a350 was calculated to quantify the abundance of chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom spencer et al 2013 wang et al 2021c the spectroscopic indices were calculated to characterize the dom the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 in l mg c m an indicator for dom aromaticity was calculated by dividing absorbance values at 254 nm a254 by the doc concentration weishaar et al 2003 the fluorescence index fi a descriptor of the dom source approximately 1 8 microbial origin approximately 1 2 terrestrial source was calculated as the ratio of the fluorescence intensity at em 470 nm to that at 520 nm when excitation wavelength was 370 nm cory and mcknight 2005 the biological index bix a metric for the contribution of newly produced autochthonous dom content was calculated as the ratio of emission intensity at 380 nm to the maximum emission intensity between 420 and 435 nm when the excitation wavelength was 310 nm wilson and xenopoulos 2008 parallel factor analysis parafac was used to decompose the eems into different fluorescent dom fdom components murphy et al 2013 and the model was validated based on the split half analysis stedmon and bro 2008 all components were further compared to the previously reported models in the openfluor database murphy et al 2014 a six component model was finally established and the fluorescence intensity at the maximum fmax for each component was quantified murphy et al 2013 a solution state 1h nmr analysis was utilized to obtain general structural information about dom in lake water samples method s1 approximately 800 ml of composited filtered water samples were freeze dried using 1 l high density polyethylene bottles nalgene then approximately 5 mg of dried sample was resuspended in 500 μl of deuterium oxide d2o and titrated to ph 14 using naod to ensure complete solubility before analysis with a bruker biospin avance iii 500 mhz nmr spectrometer karlsruhe germany the 1h nmr spectra were obtained using pre saturation utilizing relaxation gradients and echoes for resonance inhibition simpson and brown 2005 spectra were apodised through multiplication with an exponential decay corresponding to 2 0 hz line broadening and a zero filling factor of two simpson and brown 2005 four regions were integrated from the one dimensional 1h nmr spectra which included 1 materials derived from linear terpenoids mdlt 0 6 1 6 ppm 2 carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules cram 1 6 3 2 ppm 3 carbohydrates and peptides carb 3 2 4 5 ppm and 4 aromatics and phenolics arom 6 5 8 4 ppm lam et al 2007 to obtain molecular level insights into the impact of lake reclamation on the formula composition of dom we further analyzed the samples by ft icr ms the detailed method is provided in method s2 in supporting information wang et al 2021b zhou et al 2021 the elemental formula was assigned to each monoisotopic mass using formularity software tolic et al 2017 with constraints of c0 100h0 200o0 50n0 10s0 2 h c 2 5 o c 1 2 n c 0 5 and s c 0 2 koch and dittmar 2006 double bond equivalents dbe and the modified aromaticity index aimod were calculated to evaluate the unsaturation degree and aromaticity of each compound respectively koch and dittmar 2006 2016 in addition the molecular lability boundary for more labile contributions mlbl was calculated as described previously lechtenfeld et al 2014 the abundance weighted average of formulae within the island of stability ios was defined as formulae with 1 04 h c 1 3 0 42 o c 0 62 and 332 m z 388 or 446 m z 548 lechtenfeld et al 2014 intensity weighted methods were applied to calculate the average molecular weight mw dbe aimod and h c and o c ratios seven biochemical groups were assigned following the classification method wu et al 2018 with small modifications which include 1 lipid like 0 o c 0 2 1 5 h c 2 3 n c 0 04 and s 0 2 protein like 0 2 o c 0 52 1 5 h c 2 2 and 0 178 n c 0 44 3 amino sugar like 0 52 o c 0 7 1 5 h c 2 2 0 07 n c 0 182 and s 0 4 carbohydrate like 0 7 o c 1 1 1 5 h c 2 4 n 0 and s 0 5 condensed aromatics like 0 o c 0 25 0 5 h c 1 25 and s 0 6 lignin like 0 25 o c 0 67 0 75 h c 1 5 and s 0 and 7 tannin like compounds 0 67 o c 0 97 0 53 h c 1 5 and s 0 the relative abundances of different biochemical groups were determined as the ratio of their signals to the total signal of all assigned formulae the percentage change of component i in dom in rs relative to nw δmass i was roughly estimated as shown below eq 1 based on the assumption that the total quantity of components was approximately in proportion to the quantity of dissolved organic carbon wang et al 2020a 1 δ mass i m do c rs p i rs m do c nw p i nw 1 100 where m docnw and m docrs are the doc concentrations in mg l in nw and rs respectively and p i nw and p i rs are the relative abundances of component i in dom in in nw and rs respectively to compare the mass formulas of nw and rs in each lake the mass peaks that were present in both nw and rs were named as common presence data while those that were only present either in nw or rs were different presence data herzsprung et al 2012 the results of common presence and different presence were depicted using van krevelen diagrams 2 4 data processing and statistical analyses to avoid the possible bias of different site numbers from different lakes we used the average parameters of each lake for statistical analysis so that each lake would have the same weight differences in the general water quality e g doc and don values spectroscopic indices e g suva fi and bix components in 1h nmr spectra and characteristics indicated by ft icr ms were analyzed using spss v20 il a paired sample t test was conducted to compare the difference in dom composition with and without reclamation alternatively the nonparametric wilcoxon signed ranks test was employed if the parameters did not satisfy the assumptions of a t test significant difference was set at a level of p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 elevated doc concentrations with reclamation doc concentrations were significantly higher in rs than in nw across all the lake samples p 0 01 fig 2 a the average doc concentrations of nine lakes in nw and rs were 3 3 and 4 2 mg l respectively the percentage change of doc in rs relative to nw ranged from 11 to 120 and the average value was 32 fig 2a in the reclaimed aquacultural zones although most of the organic rich feed is consumed by fish shrimp and crab approximately 30 of the feed could be retained in the water bodies herbeck et al 2013 the residual feed and the biological excrement from aquatic organisms after decomposition is likely an important source of organic matter and could explain the increase of doc with reclamation cripps and bergheim 2000 such increases in the doc are also consistent with the recent finding that the rs consistently had a higher light absorbing capacity than the nw nearby based on the remote sensing techniques hou et al 2020 although the doc concentrations were significantly higher in rs than nw there was no significant difference in the don concentrations between rs and nw p 0 664 fig 2b 3 2 elevated humic like fdom and relatively stable protein like fdom with reclamation significant alterations in spectroscopic indices of lacustrine dom by lake reclamation are illustrated in fig 2c 2f there was no significant difference in suva or bix of the lacustrine dom between rs and nw for all samples p 0 08 fig 2d f the fi values were significantly higher in rs than in nw across all samples indicating that dom derived from phytoplankton and microbes increased with lake reclamation p 0 02 fig 2e the cdom indicated by a350 was more abundant with reclamation p 0 01 and increased by 28 on average in rs relative to nw fig 2c which is comparable to the increase of bulk dom indicated by doc concentrations 32 fig 2a pearson s correlation analysis table s2 indicated that a350 correlated well with doc concentrations r 0 62 p 0 01 this result suggested that the increase of cdom was mainly attributed to the increase in the absolute quantity of bulk dom parafac modeling is a rapid tool to reveal fdom components six different fdom components including three humic like c1 c2 and c3 and three protein like components c4 c5 and c6 were identified fig 3 a the detailed description of each component is summarized in table s2 the sum fmax of six components σfmax the indicator of the abundance of total fdom was 21 higher in rs than in nw across all samples p 0 05 fig 3b furthermore the impact of reclamation on the fmax was found to be dependent on the component for instance the lake reclamation marginally increased the abundance of total humic like fdom c1 c2 and c3 p 0 06 by 36 on average but did not significantly alter the abundance of total protein like fdom c4 c5 and c6 p 0 28 within the humic like fdom the microbial humic like fdom c1 had a greater increase by 38 than the terrestrial humic like i c2 and ii c3 fdom 31 and 36 respectively interestingly the abundances of total protein like fdom such as tyrosine and tryptophan c4 c5 and c6 in both nw and rs of th and ych were remarkably higher than those in other lakes fig 3b since the th i e taihu lake suffered from severe eutrophication in the past few years the metabolism of algal blooms is likely responsible for the higher percentage of total protein like substances this result was supported by previously reported findings that dom in the th was dominated by protein like components which accounted for 85 of total fluorescence intensity cai et al 2019 murphy et al 2008 wang et al 2020b similarly the ych i e yangchenghu lake a typical aquaculture lake for intensive crab breeding liu et al 2019 contained abundant nutrients from residual crab bait which accelerated the massive growth of microorganisms and led to a higher abundance of protein like fdom than other lakes studied regardless of reclamation fig 3b 3 3 elevated levels of carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules and materials derived from linear terpenoids with reclamation 1h nmr analyses were used to further clarify the impact of reclamation on the chemical characteristics of lacustrine dom in different lakes the relative percentage of each dom component decreased in the order of carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules cram 35 43 materials derived from linear terpenoids mdlt 29 36 carbohydrates and peptides carb 21 33 aromatics and phenolics arom 1 3 for all samples fig 4 b e this result aligned with the predominance of cram over carbohydrates and aromatics in a prior study that characterized lake dom composition using 1h nmr analyses cao et al 2018 taking the doc concentration into account lake reclamation significantly increased the cram by 34 on average ranging from 9 to 125 p 0 03 and mdlt by 26 on average ranging from 15 to 85 p 0 04 but did not significantly alter the contents of aromatics and phenolics p 0 09 and carbohydrates and peptides p 0 09 fig 4f differently a previous study found that land based salmon aquacultures had an increased abundance of carbohydrates and peptides in effluent dom compared to that in the control sites kamjunke et al 2017 this result might be because salmon aquacultures had strikingly higher doc concentration 1 5 4 2 mg c l than the control site 0 2 0 4 mg c l and could release large quantities of bioavailable metabolites e g carbohydrates and peptides nevertheless according to prior studies a significant portion of cram is microbial derived lechtenfeld et al 2015 and the higher cram components with reclamation were consistent with the increased microbial production indicated by elevated abundances of microbial humic like fdom fig 3b and fi values fig 2e moreover since mdlt is composed primarily of aliphatic molecules that are likely derived from conjugated terpenoid molecules such as carotenoids found in terrestrial and aquatic biomass lam et al 2007 the higher mdlt values suggested more aliphatic compounds in dom with lake reclamation 3 4 identifying molecular features with reclamation the average molecular weight mw values of dom were significantly lower in rs than nw across all samples p 0 03 table 1 the lower mw in rs was possibly attributed to the stronger leaching of low molecular weight dom because of the elevated microbial decomposition of lacustrine dom li et al 2020 the reclaimed lakes had substantially higher mlbl values than those of dom in nw p 0 02 the ios ranged from 5 6 to 12 5 and showed a lower ios in rs p 0 05 since mlbl had a positive correlation with dom lability d andrilli et al 2015 lechtenfeld et al 2014 and ios was reversely correlated with dom lability the elevated mlbl values and decreased ios collectively demonstrated that reclamation significantly increased the dom lability the dom was classified into seven biochemical groups based on the molecular formulas assigned to individual mass spectral peaks figs 5 s2 the lacustrine dom was dominated by lignin like compounds 70 fig s2a followed by tannin like 2 6 fig s2b lipid like 1 10 fig 5a and condensed aromatic like compounds 1 2 fig s2c the dominance of lignin like components was also observed in other lacustrine dom characterized using ft icr ms kellerman et al 2014 the relative abundance of lignin like components was significantly lower in rs than in nw p 0 007 since lignin originates mainly from the cell walls of vascular plants and is a major residual component of decomposed terrestrial plants kalbitz et al 2000 the lower abundance of lignin like components in rs agrees with the lower contribution of terrestrial origins indicated by higher fi values in fig 2e taking the amount of dom concentration into consideration the percentage changes of each biochemical component were estimated in fig 5e based on the estimations the lake reclamation was found to significantly increase the contents of lipid like components by 149 on average ranging from 16 to 533 p 0 04 and condensed aromatics like components by 93 on average ranging from 17 to 357 p 0 03 but did not significantly alter the contents of lignin like p 0 08 and tannin like p 0 22 amino sugar like p 0 13 carbohydrate like p 0 12 and protein like p 0 11 components the higher estimated percentage changes of the lipid compounds with reclamation contributed to the higher lability indicated by increased mlbl values table 1 the increase in microbial derived lipid like components with reclamation was supported by the increased microbial production indicated by fi values fig 2e the conversion of lignin to condensed aromatics via hydroxyl radical initiated oxidation will consume more lignin and accumulate more condensed aromatics this may explain the lower relative abundance of lignin like components and higher proportion of condensed aromatic like components with lake reclamation waggoner et al 2015 besides the extended evaluation of the different presence of components revealed dissimilarities between nw and rs in each lake fig s3 significant differences between nw and rs were observed particularly in dth and hh lakes specifically more aliphatic components appeared in rs of dth lake and this was consistent with the increased mdlt content which is composed primarily of aliphatic molecules with reclamation in dth fig 4f besides less oxygen rich and relatively unsaturated components were contained in rs of hh lake and this was supported by the significantly lower dbe value in rs than in nw in hh lake 3 5 linking multiple characteristics by principal component analysis pca conducted on dom characteristics showed that principal component 1 pc1 and principal component 2 pc2 explained 33 8 and 26 5 of the total variance respectively pearson s correlation analysis is displayed in table s2 the bix c5 c6 carbohydrates and peptides carb and condensed aromatics like components had positive loadings on pc1 while lignin like tannin like and cram exhibited negative pc1 loadings fig 6 a this suggests that pc1 was associated with more freshly produced fluorescent protein like fluorescent components microbial derived lipid like condensed aromatics like and carbohydrates and peptides fractions in dom by contrast pc2 can be explained by high doc content humic like fluorescent components and more biolabile components since doc c1 c2 c3 amino sugar like and protein like compounds were placed on the positive side of pc2 fig 6a distinct from other lakes the th and ych were more clustered at the positive side of pc1 regardless of reclamation indicating that dom in these two lakes contained higher microbial derived protein and lipid like components than those in other lakes this result corresponds with the prior eem parafac data on these samples showing the significantly higher protein like components in dom fig 3b as mentioned before th is a large shallow eutrophic lake with frequent recurrences of cyanobacteria qin et al 2018 while ych is famous for intensive crab breeding in southeast china and has large quantities of residual bait inputs and significant algal bloom liu et al 2019 these may be the reasons for the high microbial derived components in the two lakes even though the lacustrine dom in nw varied greatly between the lakes the consistently increased pc2 scores with reclamation for almost all lakes except txh fig 6b demonstrated that reclamation did significantly alter the lacustrine dom characteristics this result suggested that reclamation tends to increase the abundances of bulk dom cdom and humic like fdom particularly microbial derivatives as well as the lipids e g mdlt and cram and condensed aromatics and decrease the average molecular weight of dom in txh i e tangxunhu lake the bulk dom 10 fig 2a cdom 7 fig 2c humic like fdom 4 fig 3b and microbial humic like 7 fig 3b were not significantly altered by reclamation as compared to other lakes this was probably due to the policy of control of algae by planktivorous fish implemented in txh du et al 2021 in this policy large quantities of planktivorous fish e g silver carp and bighead carp were put into the aquacultural zones in txh to regulate algal bloom biomass leading to the rapid reduction of microbial derived dom yi et al 2016 furthermore less feed and fertilizer was suggested with this policy resulting in less bulk dom input into txh overall this may explain why txh is less affected by reclamation than other lakes 4 conclusions the results of this study suggest that there was considerable diversity in dom characteristics and composition between rs and nearby nw from multiple lakes along the yangtze river the lacustrine dom quantity rose significantly in the reclaimed aquacultural zones possibly because of the increased anthropogenic inputs of feeds and the subsequential dom contributions of algae microbes and other aquatic organisms e g fish shrimp and crab the characteristics and composition of dom were altered significantly by reclamation specifically cdom humic like fdom lipids condensed aromatics and biolabile components indicated by mlbl were increased by 28 36 149 93 and 20 on average respectively while the molecular weight was remarkably decreased from 360 da in nw to 356 da in rs there could be some possible environmental consequences of lake reclamation based on the results of this study for instance increased doc and a smaller molecular weight of dom from reclamation found in this study are expected to lead to a higher production of toxic dbp which may pose potential threats to the water safety for millions of people who are living around the yangtze plain furthermore a higher doc level and biolability altered by reclamation may contribute to greater emissions of greenhouse gasses as dom can fuel or prime microbial processes nevertheless the above speculations concerning the effect of reclamation on dbp production as well as greenhouse gas emissions remain unclear and require more efforts in future studies to elucidate the linkages among reclamation water quality and global warming declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no
