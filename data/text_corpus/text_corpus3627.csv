also cause serious membrane fouling as polymer in situ raman spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis were applied to monitor the effects of coagulant aids on the membrane the causes of fouling were assisted discussed through stage cleaning of the membrane the equivalent circuit fitting was performed on the eis data and the raman spectral data were statistically analyzed after peak fitting eis and the cluster analysis of raman spectroscopy provided an earlier feedback on membrane fouling layers compared to flux the cause of membrane fouling was explained via variation of characteristic functional groups obtained by raman spectroscopy when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid was 160 times 80 times and 16 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane the equivalent circuit obtained by fitting the eis of the uf system satisfied rs c qprp rs qcrc qprp and rs qt rc qprp respectively partial correlation analysis showed that the corresponding factors

introduction as a water treatment technology that removes pollutants from drinking water by mechanical sieving ultrafiltration uf can effectively remove particulate matter and bacteria from water and ensure the stability and biosafety of effluent water quality although uf technology has been extensively used the problem of membrane fouling is still a key factor restricting the uf process meng et al 2017 cheng et al 2017 coagulation is currently the most widely used pretreatment technology which has the advantages of low cost and easy operation wang et al 2015 the coagulation is mainly caused through the hydrolysis in the water after the addition of coagulant then the compressed electric double layer adsorption electric neutralization adsorption bridging and net trapping sweeping are generated to remove the pollutants zhou and meng 2015 the combination of coagulation and uf can ensure efficient water production of the membrane for some special sewage such as low temperature with low turbidity sewage high molecular flocculant is often used as coagulant aid in combination with inorganic coagulant yu et al 2013 coagulant aids are roughly classified into organic polymers and inorganic polymers which mainly improve the floc structure and improve the coagulation effect by bridging yao et al 2015 for a long time most scholars have been devoted to finding the optimal amount of coagulant and coagulant aid to optimize the coagulation conditions and minimise membrane fouling yu et al 2013 yao et al 2015 liu et al 2017 all of these studies have only analyzed the positive effects of coagulant aids on reducing membrane fouling however polymer compound has many properties similar to protein and polysaccharide when it is transferred from the coagulation stage to the filtration stage residues may foul the membrane moreover flocs containing the macromolecular compound may also form the greater membrane fouling than when it is not present the result suggested that low concentrations of coagulant aid can also cause serious membrane fouling ma et al 2015 the study of guicai liu et al revealed that apam has different fouling mechanisms on pvdf membrane in the presence of ca2 and na liu et al 2016 it was reported that coagulant aids can alleviate membrane fouling during coagulation ultrafiltration while membrane fouling will increase when further increasing in its dosage zhang et al 2017 ma et al 2018 in summary although some researchers have focused on the fact that polymer coagulants may cause membrane fouling the influence of coagulant aid is mostly analyzed by instrumental characterization of the final contaminated membrane there are few studies on the negative effects of coagulant aids on the membrane and the two way dynamic mechanism of polymer coagulant aid on membrane fouling is unclear during the entire c uf process therefore real time online monitoring of membrane fouling is extremely necessary raman spectroscopy had provided a theoretical basis for the characterization of membrane fouling chen et al 2018a some studies have monitored the fouling process and tendency of organic and biomembranes on membranes by surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers chen et al 2015 kögler et al 2016 in order to avoid the negative impact of surface enhanced substances gold or silver nanoparticles some scholars used ordinary raman spectroscopy for direct on line monitoring and combined the mathematical methods such as multivariate curve resolution alternating least squares mcr als to achieve semi quantitative analysis of target substances wang et al 2014 ferreira et al 2015 virtanen et al 2017 so raman spectroscopy can identify multiple groups in aqueous systems so as to realize the recognition of different foulants simultaneously in addition electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis showed high sensitivity in real time monitoring of membrane filtration performance eis can identify membrane fouling including organic fouling in reverse osmosis and ion exchange systems sim et al 2016 shaffer et al 2019 chilcott et al 2017 it is also feasible for eis and its extended hydraulic impedance spectroscopy to track the accumulation and reversibility of contaminants during uf palencia et al 2010 martí calatayud and wessling 2017 martí calatayud et al 2018 gao fei et al further successfully characterized the protein contamination on the membrane by synchronous uv vis spectroscopy and eis gao et al 2018 it can be seen that eis and raman spectroscopy are expected to be powerful tool to reveal the effect of coagulant aids on membrane fouling for the double sided effect of the polymer coagulant aid this study first explored the synergistic effect of polymer coagulant aid in the final membrane fouling during c uf based on the complex interaction between coagulant aid contaminant and membrane yang et al 2014 according to different types of polymer coagulant aids the evolution of membrane fouling was determined by eis under different molecular weight cut off membranes then the accumulation of contaminants on the membrane surface was recorded by synchronous raman spectroscopy to analyze the cause of membrane fouling it is expected that the impact mechanism of coagulant aid in membrane fouling especially irreversible membrane fouling is revealed through the in situ on line monitoring in addition the optimal control theory of combined process based on polymer coagulant aid is established to promote the further application of c uf technology 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw water and chemicals the raw water was prepared by mixing 20 mg of humic acid ha 10 mm of kcl and 1l of deionized water which required a homogenizer ae500s h angni instruments china to stir at 1000 rpm min for

200 2800 cm 1 peak fitting was performed via the peakfit v 4 12 software package and the gauss amp method was selected for the fitting of raman characteristic peaks chen et al 2017a in order to ensure the reliability of the fitted data the correlation coefficient r2 reaches 0 99 2 5 3 electrochemical measurement in present study eis measurements were used to systematically study the membrane solution interface behavior during fouling process and the transfer of charges in the filtration system at different coagulant aids on an electrochemical workstation autolab pgstat 204 as displayed in fig 1 this system made use of the four terminal method which separated the process of current conduction and voltage sensing by using separate pairs of electrodes both the current and voltage electrodes were made of platinum consisting of a platinum wire ring as working electrode a platinum foil counter electrode and a pair of platinum wire as voltage electrodes eis was completed at the open circuit potential ocp scanned over the frequency of 0 1 105 hz for each scan two replicates of eis were obtained the measured data were modeled with nyquist plots which could provide a more direct representation of the membrane fouling process 2 5 4 calculation of membrane fouling to analyze the membrane fouling in detail several fouling resistances were determined ding et al 2017 qu et al 2012 the total fouling ratio reversible irreversible fouling ratios and irreversible index were defined and calculated as given in eqs 1 4 and the characteristic of cleaning the membrane was expressed by eq 5 eq 1 rt 1 jp j1 100 eq 2 rr j2 jp j1 100 eq 3 rir j1 j2 j1 100 eq 4 ii rir rt where jp represents the flux after 6 h of filtration l m2 h j1 represents the pure water flux of the original membrane l m2 h j2 represents the pure water flux after membrane cleaning l m2 h rt represents total fouling ratio rr represents reversible fouling ratio rir represents irreversible fouling ratio and ii represents the proportion of rir in rt eq 5 ec sc s6h where sc represents the characteristic peak integrated area of the target pollutant after cleaning s6h represents the integral characteristic peak area at the corresponding terminal moment the ec was used to represent the cleaning efficiency of membrane fouling the smaller the ec the less the contaminant remains on the membrane surface which means the higher cleaning efficiency 2 5 5 statistical analysis statistical analyses cluster analysis and partial correlation were performed to identify the evolution of the membrane fouling layer and the potential for membrane fouling in the presence of different coagulant aids in the case of multiple samples and multiple variables cluster analysis can be summarized into several categories according to the characteristics of the sample hajigholizadeh and melesse 2017 and the distance between the sample and the sample similarity served as the basis for cluster analysis between groups linkage was used as cluster method and squared euclidean distance was applied to measure the distance of distinct samples the data used for cluster analysis were the raman spectra of the membrane surface at 8 times 0 6 h which had already been standardized partial pearson correlation indicates the independent correlations between two variables under the condition that some other variables are kept invariable partial correlation coefficient r is between 1 and 1 is indicators of linear estimations 1 1 and 0 indicate a perfect negative correlation a perfect positive correlation and the absence of relationship respectively the larger the absolute value of the r the stronger the linear relationship the difference between the two variables is significant often denoted as p 0 05 if p 0 01 the difference between the two variables is considered to be extremely significant and nonsignificant when p 0 05 shen et al 2012 all statistical analyses were carried out using the spss 22 0 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 monitoring the development of membrane fouling layer with coagulant aids by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis 3 1 1 equivalent circuit of ultrafiltration system according to the prior test the removal of ha by the three molecular weight cut off pvdf ultrafiltration membranes was in the degree of large removal removal was over 80 low removal removal was about 50 and very small removal removal was less than 30 when no coagulant aid was added in combination with the properties of the coagulant aid and membrane the synergistic effect was discussed in terms of the molecular weight of the coagulant aid was 160 times 80 times and 16 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane in the following chapters the aim of eis is to simultaneously monitor the accumulation of foulants at the membrane solution interface throughout the uf process after coagulation the real and imaginary impedance data were graphically presented as a nyquist plot which consisted of a number of overlapping semicircles where a single maxwell wagner element producing a semicircular plot the frequency dependent complex impedance can be modeled with a series of circuit elements representing the inner and outer layers of the membrane namely the maxwell wagner model ho et al 2016 according to the mwco of the membrane and the size relationship of the target foulant as shown in fig 2 the equivalent circuit obtained by fitting the eis of the ultrafiltration system correspond to rs c qprp rs qcrc qprp and rs qt rc qprp respectively rs represents the ionic resistance of the interface solution layer rc is the resistance of the corresponding membrane layer and rp is the membrane solution interface resistance which is related to the migration of contaminants and ions at the interface constant phase components qp and qt were used to simulate the interface capacitance and total capacitance these values can be extracted from the equivalent circuit using zview software 3 1 2 the development of membrane fouling layer theoretically the coagulant aid would be completely trapped it was not excluded that coagulant aids with small molecular weight cannot be trapped but the proportion of this part is very small and can be ignored under the three membrane conditions the original nyquist diagram scatter and the fitted data solid line of the cf process were illustrated in fig s3 the variation of equivalent circuit parameters with time was presented in fig 3 in the legend wca without coagulant aids represented the case where no coagulant aid was added when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid was 160 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane rs c decreased gradually from the beginning of filtration to 2 h and then increased with the extension of the filtration time rs c was smaller after using cpam and asa within 2 h before filtration than in the case of no coagulant aid this indicated that cpam and asa can form larger flocs in coagulation so the degree of blockage of membrane pores was relatively slight the channels formed by the looser filter cake layer made k in the solution easier to migrate and the membrane was more conductive however the smaller flocs and a small amount of free ha ha not contained in the floc gradually led to the blockage of membrane pores which was reflected by an increase in interface resistance therefore rp has increased since the beginning of filtration moreover when npam and apam were used rp had a sharper growth rate after 2 h of filtration indicating that irreversible membrane fouling had formed the coagulant aid in this system may mainly affect the membrane fouling by the electrical interference of the side chain groups this was also consistent with the coagulation mechanism of charge neutralization and adsorption bridging that is the coagulant aid with positively charged groups is more conducive to form the flocs with lower fractal dimension and reduce membrane fouling yu et al 2019 xu et al 2019 the filtration resistance of the system was the largest after the addition of npam indicating that the side chain groups of the coagulant aid played an important role in compressing the electric double layer during coagulation interestingly the membrane fouling formed by the inorganic polymeric coagulant aid was the slightest which may be related to the formation of loose filter cake layer due to the structure of asa providing more ha adsorption sites when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid was 80 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane rs was larger than in the absence of coagulant aid and rs gradually increased to a steady state this indicated that the coagulant aid transferred from the coagulation to the uf stage also adsorbed part of the salt ions causing repulsion between them and hindering the transfer of charges and this blocking effect was most obvious in npam and least in apam there was no obvious difference in rc after the addition of the coagulant aid suggesting that the coagulant aid had no significant effect on the charge transfer of the membrane the coagulant aid with negatively charged groups was larger in rp than in the absence of coagulant aid which meant that the trend of membrane fouling was caused by two reasons first the negatively charged coagulant aid was detrimental to the destabilization of the same negatively charged ha during coagulation and thus the filter cake layer had a high porosity cannot be formed with larger flocs this result was not conducive to the transport of salt ions in the interface layer secondly the group on the skeleton polymer chain of flocs that did not connect to ha would have a relatively repulsive bridging effect with the membrane surface which in turn improved the transport of salt ions hoek and menachem 2003 the result indicated that apam and asa ultimately increased the fluid resistance at boundary layer of membrane and hindered charge transfer at the membrane solution interface however the system was in a state in which the spatial structure of the filter cake layer was dominant after adding cpam and npam the ultimate interface resistance was relatively reduced in this system there might be a competitive relationship between the external produced by the floc characteristics and the internal opposite effects produced by the structure of coagulant aid but flocs still played a decisive role from the development of membrane fouling when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid was 16 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane as shown in fig 3 the nyquist diagram in the uf process displayed a different pattern here the two obvious interfaces contained in the nyquist diagram were concerned the membrane resistance decreased until the filtration reached an equilibrium state for 1 h while the membrane solution interfacial layer resistance increased significantly notably rc and rp were greater in the presence of cpam than in the absence of coagulant aid for membrane solution interfacial resistance the increase of the total impedance indicated that the coagulant aid may be surrounded by a large amount of hydrated k on the membrane surface which hinders the migration of ions gao et al 2018 in combination with other types of coagulant aids the results showed that the hydration repelling force between the organic polymer coagulant aids was stronger moreover this mean that the cpam was more likely to have a stronger affinity with the membrane surface through covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds due to the side chain group structure and charge neutralization this led to the development of more compact fouling layer on the membrane surface so the interfacial layer resistance was greater in addition the rp in the presence of npam apam and asa was smaller than that in the absence of coagulant aids and decreased in turn in summary coagulant aids mainly acted as an independent mediator of the filter cake layer and membrane to provide channels for ion transport in this system the different effects in turn change the filter cake layer structure indirectly they may contact the membrane as foulants and indirectly change the structure of the filter cake layer compared with organic polymer inorganic polymer coagulant aid can achieve the best balance of membrane fouling in hydrogen bond attraction and charge repulsion the initial decrease in the charge transfer resistance rc of the membrane layer was attributed to the transport of salt ions to the surface of membrane however the rm with the coagulant aid was still slowly decreasing after 1 h indicating that the ions around the coagulant aid were released and directed toward the pores of the membrane as the cake layer was continuously compacted so the conductivity of the membrane layer increased and the resistance decreased this can also be verified by the opposite trend of rm and rc between npam apam and asa 3 2 tracking the accumulation of contaminants by raman spectroscopy 3 2 1 cluster analysis of on line raman spectroscopy in c uf process based on section 3 1 in addition to the eis monitoring of the membrane fouling layer in the uf the role of target foulants ie ha and polymer coagulant aid in the formation of membrane fouling was simultaneously explored by online raman spectroscopy compared with the five cases of no coagulant aid and four types of coagulant aids the original raman spectra at 8 time points of 0 0 5 h 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 h 5 h and 6 h in the uf process were shown in fig s4 the spectra was applied to record changes in membrane surface functional groups at different degrees of fouling in situ in principle both the target contaminants and the uf membrane will have multiple characteristic peaks in the raman spectrum in order to avoid overlapping of the characteristic peaks with each other a unique raman scattering peak was selected to represent the substance of interest for analysis the characteristic peak appearing around 1379 cm 1 is attributed to the c c vibration of polyaromatic compounds in ha roldán et al 2011 the raman peak near 1242 cm 1 is related to the polyacrylamide iii band degardin et al 2017 the raman peak near 982 cm 1 is the symmetrical stretching vibration of the ho si o bond in the asa halasz et al 2007 the raman peak at 1616 cm 1 and 1729 cm 1 are assigned to the vibration of cc and co in the uf membrane huang et al 2015 which are ignored in this study the peak height and integral area of the characteristic peaks were extracted by gaussian fitting as shown in fig 4 the tree diagram of the system clustering method was displayed in fig 5 which clearly showed the clustering process these data have been compared with the same conditions using the class spacing 5 as the dividing line when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid was 160 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane the whole fouling process was roughly divided into three stages of the initial stage 0 1 h development stage 1 2 h and stabilization stage 2 6 h in all cases after the application of coagulant aids there was no significant difference between the fouling development stage and stabilization stage which showed that the distance between the second and third stage groups decreased the addition of cpam was slightly different from the other three cases indicating that cpam slowly affected the formation of the fouling layer in a gradual manner while the other three types of coagulant aids had little intervention at the later stage of filtration when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid was 80 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane the fouling process was also roughly divided into the initial stage 0 1 h development stage 1 2 h and stabilization stage 2 6 h without coagulant aids only in the presence of cpam the stabilization stage of fouling was delayed this indicated that cpam had the greatest impact on the development of the fouling layer and slowed down the fouling process when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid was 16 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane the fouling process became the initial stage 0 2 h development stage 3 4 h and stabilization stage 5 6 h without the coagulant aid after adding cpam apam and npam the initial stage was shortened after the addition of asa the initial stage 0 1 h was followed directly by the stabilization stage 2 6 h these results indicated that different coagulant aids formed a membrane fouling state at the early stage of c uf and that it did not easily change with filtration in a word the cluster analysis of raman spectroscopy verified the formation of the membrane fouling layer in section 3 1 3 2 2 peak fitting of raman spectroscopy in order to more intuitively compare the accumulation of ha and the coagulant aid on the membrane surface they were extracted from the overall spectrum by peak fitting the integral area of characteristic peak obtained by gaussian fitting changed with the filtration time as depicted in fig 6 when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid was 160 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane comparing the integral area of the characteristic peaks in the stabilization stage they were found to have a large improvement compared with the previous values this indicated that the formation of irreversible fouling caused different degrees of filtration resistance to increase and more flocs containing ha and coagulant aid accumulated on the membrane surface during the stabilization stage the characteristic peak integral area of ha sequentially reduced at a certain time from snpam ha sapam ha swithout coagulant aid ha scpam ha to sasa ha and there was also a consistent trend in the amount of accumulation in other words the coagulant aid and ha were transferred synchronously under this condition the addition of cpam and asa ultimately conduced to reduce irreversible fouling and slow down the membrane fouling according to the change of scoagulant aid sha the relative accumulation of the coagulant aid became larger after development stage indicating that ha gradually caused blockage of the membrane pores when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid was 80 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane the characteristic peak integral area of ha sequentially reduced according to the order of sapam ha sasa ha snpam ha swithout coagulant aid ha and scpam ha at a certain time it is worth noting that the characteristic peak area of ha had a significant increase after initial stage but the change of sha was relatively small after adding npam and cpam combined with the final accumulation of the coagulant aid the membrane fouling formed after the addition of cpam was the slightest overall scoagulant aid sha had a tendency to increase during uf meaning that the coagulant aid and ha were simultaneously transferred under this condition when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid was 16 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane the integral characteristic peak area of ha and cpam was the largest at a certain time and they were the only values that were larger than those without coagulant aids that is to say only the addition of cpam cannot alleviate the membrane fouling it is apparent that sasa ha had a substantial increase in entering the stabilization stage compared to the absence of coagulant aids moreover the scoagulant aid sha showed an alternate trend increase decrease increase when the other three coagulant aids were used and they all reached a stable plateau however scoagulant aid sha decreased sharply after initial stage and then remained stable in the presence of asa this suggested that both ha and coagulant aids can affect each other relatively independently and the asa retained more ha this further explained the cause of the fouling layer in 3 1 2 comparing the changes of membrane specific flux during the c uf fig 7 a stable flux change was observed after 4 h in each of the three cases indicating that a obvious contamination state had formed so on line monitoring by raman spectroscopy and eis provided earlier and more detailed information on the irreversible membrane fouling 3 3 contribution of coagulant aids to membrane fouling 3 3 1 effect of coagulant aid on membrane cleaning in the late stage of filtration the interfacial action in uf had converted from the action between the contaminant membrane into the contaminant contaminant the surface properties and steric hindrance of the contaminated membrane would change liu et al 2016 chen et al 2017b the performance of coagulant aids in membrane fouling removal under different membrane conditions be explored below the characteristic peaks of ha and coagulant aids in the raman spectrum of the membrane surface after washing were extracted and the same peak fitting was adopted as that of section 3 2 2 the cleaning efficiency ec of membrane and the mean roughness ra of the cleaned membrane were measured after 6 h of filtration as depicted as fig 8 when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid is 160 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane the cleaning efficiency of ha was reduced after the addition of the coagulant aid as far as the coagulant aid was concerned cpam was the most unfavorable for the cleaning of ha and the removal of asa after cleaning was the largest in combination with the ra ra was smaller in the presence of coagulant aid than that without it this suggested that the coagulant aid could eventually lead to the formation of a denser fouling layer which was not conducive to membrane cleaning when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid is 80 times larger than the mwco of uf membrane apam minimized the separation of ha from the membrane surface and its own cleaning efficiency was also minimal moreover ra increased dramatically in the presence of apam compared to the absence of coagulant aid this suggested that the fouling layer formed by the close action of apam and ha was very uneven but the binding of apam to the membrane was very strong when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid is 16 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane the cleaning efficiency of ha was the largest after the addition of npam asa had little effect on the cleaning of ha but asa was easiest to clean this was also consistent with our discussion of the membrane fouling process and implied that the effect of inorganic polymer coagulant aid and membrane was the weakest under this condition 3 3 2 partial correlation analysis of membrane fouling the irreversible fouling of the membrane is the biggest obstacle to the long term efficient operation of the cf process the complex interaction between ha coagulant aid and uf membrane resulted in membrane fouling chen et al 2018b in order to eliminate the autocorrelation between ha and coagulant aid partial correlation was further used to explore whether ha or coagulant aid was more important for irreversible fouling under different conditions according to the results of online monitoring 0 5 h 1 h 2 h and 6 h were mainly selected as the time nodes for cleaning of membrane fouling and the corresponding rr rir and rt were calculated one of the raman peak integral areas of ha and coagulant aid was taken as the control variable and then a linear correlation between another variable and ii was explored as given in fig 9 when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid was160 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane the ha and the coagulant aid had different fouling potentials the correlation between ha and ii was very significant r 0 754 p 0 007 0 01 and its correlation with the content of coagulant aid was negligible r 0 581 p 0 061 0 05 this indicated that ha contributed to the formation of irreversible fouling while coagulant aid indirectly affected membrane fouling by regulating the morphology of the flocs when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid is 80 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane it can be noted that the ha was closely related to the ii r 0 917 p 0 001 0 01 and so was the coagulant aid r 0 916 p 0 001 0 01 ha and coagulant aid together caused irreversible fouling but the two actions were reversed it showed that the interaction between coagulant aid and membrane and the effect of coagulant aid on flocs had the favorable side in mitigating membrane fouling which also met the discussion of membrane fouling process in the corresponding section 3 1 2 when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid is 16 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane the correlation between ha and ii was very slight r 0 582 p 0 17 0 05 and the coagulant aid had a significant correlation with ii r 0 8 p 0 031 0 05 in other word the coagulant aid played a dominant role in the irreversible fouling 4 conclusions the coagulant aid with good coagulation effect may not always perform optimally in ultrafiltration stage the role of the coagulant aid in the formation of membrane fouling was determined by the retention characteristics of uf membrane and the interaction of the coagulant aid with foulant which is called the synergistic effect in general the results of raman spectroscopy and eis are consistent for the analysis of membrane fouling but the relationship between the two is progressive or from appearance to internal moreover raman spectroscopy and eis can provide early feedback on the occurrence of fouling by online monitoring coagulant aids would affect the process of the initial stage development stage and stabilization stage of the membrane fouling layer under different membrane conditions when the mwco of the uf membrane is small the coagulant aid mainly affects the membrane fouling by the electrical interference of the side chain groups when the mwco of the membrane is moderate the opposite effect of the external produced by flocs and the internal effect of the coagulant aids structure compete with each other in the final spatial effect and finally the flocs play the decisive role when the mwco of the membrane is large the coagulant aid acts more as a foulant to indirectly change the structure of the filter cake layer and cpam causes the most serious membrane fouling coagulant aids have different performance in membrane cleaning and also affect the removal of ha from the membrane when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid is 160 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane irreversible fouling of the membrane is mainly caused by ha

18135,the polymer coagulant aid can effectively enhance the coagulation ultrafiltration c uf process for the purification of drinking water however when coagulant aid entered the filtration it may also cause serious membrane fouling as polymer in situ raman spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis were applied to monitor the effects of coagulant aids on the membrane the causes of fouling were assisted discussed through stage cleaning of the membrane the equivalent circuit fitting was performed on the eis data and the raman spectral data were statistically analyzed after peak fitting eis and the cluster analysis of raman spectroscopy provided an earlier feedback on membrane fouling layers compared to flux the cause of membrane fouling was explained via variation of characteristic functional groups obtained by raman spectroscopy when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid was 160 times 80 times and 16 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane the equivalent circuit obtained by fitting the eis of the uf system satisfied rs c qprp rs qcrc qprp and rs qt rc qprp respectively partial correlation analysis showed that the corresponding factors

introduction as a water treatment technology that removes pollutants from drinking water by mechanical sieving ultrafiltration uf can effectively remove particulate matter and bacteria from water and ensure the stability and biosafety of effluent water quality although uf technology has been extensively used the problem of membrane fouling is still a key factor restricting the uf process meng et al 2017 cheng et al 2017 coagulation is currently the most widely used pretreatment technology which has the advantages of low cost and easy operation wang et al 2015 the coagulation is mainly caused through the hydrolysis in the water after the addition of coagulant then the compressed electric double layer adsorption electric neutralization adsorption bridging and net trapping sweeping are generated to remove the pollutants zhou and meng 2015 the combination of coagulation and uf can ensure efficient water production of the membrane for some special sewage such as low temperature with low turbidity sewage high molecular flocculant is often used as coagulant aid in combination with inorganic coagulant yu et al 2013 coagulant aids are roughly classified into organic polymers and inorganic polymers which mainly improve the floc structure and improve the coagulation effect by bridging yao et al 2015 for a long time most scholars have been devoted to finding the optimal amount of coagulant and coagulant aid to optimize the coagulation conditions and minimise membrane fouling yu et al 2013 yao et al 2015 liu et al 2017 all of these studies have only analyzed the positive effects of coagulant aids on reducing membrane fouling however polymer compound has many properties similar to protein and polysaccharide when it is transferred from the coagulation stage to the filtration stage residues may foul the membrane moreover flocs containing the macromolecular compound may also form the greater membrane fouling than when it is not present the result suggested that low concentrations of coagulant aid can also cause serious membrane fouling ma et al 2015 the study of guicai liu et al revealed that apam has different fouling mechanisms on pvdf membrane in the presence of ca2 and na liu et al 2016 it was reported that coagulant aids can alleviate membrane fouling during coagulation ultrafiltration while membrane fouling will increase when further increasing in its dosage zhang et al 2017 ma et al 2018 in summary although some researchers have focused on the fact that polymer coagulants may cause membrane fouling the influence of coagulant aid is mostly analyzed by instrumental characterization of the final contaminated membrane there are few studies on the negative effects of coagulant aids on the membrane and the two way dynamic mechanism of polymer coagulant aid on membrane fouling is unclear during the entire c uf process therefore real time online monitoring of membrane fouling is extremely necessary raman spectroscopy had provided a theoretical basis for the characterization of membrane fouling chen et al 2018a some studies have monitored the fouling process and tendency of organic and biomembranes on membranes by surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers chen et al 2015 kögler et al 2016 in order to avoid the negative impact of surface enhanced substances gold or silver nanoparticles some scholars used ordinary raman spectroscopy for direct on line monitoring and combined the mathematical methods such as multivariate curve resolution alternating least squares mcr als to achieve semi quantitative analysis of target substances wang et al 2014 ferreira et al 2015 virtanen et al 2017 so raman spectroscopy can identify multiple groups in aqueous systems so as to realize the recognition of different foulants simultaneously in addition electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis showed high sensitivity in real time monitoring of membrane filtration performance eis can identify membrane fouling including organic fouling in reverse osmosis and ion exchange systems sim et al 2016 shaffer et al 2019 chilcott et al 2017 it is also feasible for eis and its extended hydraulic impedance spectroscopy to track the accumulation and reversibility of contaminants during uf palencia et al 2010 martí calatayud and wessling 2017 martí calatayud et al 2018 gao fei et al further successfully characterized the protein contamination on the membrane by synchronous uv vis spectroscopy and eis gao et al 2018 it can be seen that eis and raman spectroscopy are expected to be powerful tool to reveal the effect of coagulant aids on membrane fouling for the double sided effect of the polymer coagulant aid this study first explored the synergistic effect of polymer coagulant aid in the final membrane fouling during c uf based on the complex interaction between coagulant aid contaminant and membrane yang et al 2014 according to different types of polymer coagulant aids the evolution of membrane fouling was determined by eis under different molecular weight cut off membranes then the accumulation of contaminants on the membrane surface was recorded by synchronous raman spectroscopy to analyze the cause of membrane fouling it is expected that the impact mechanism of coagulant aid in membrane fouling especially irreversible membrane fouling is revealed through the in situ on line monitoring in addition the optimal control theory of combined process based on polymer coagulant aid is established to promote the further application of c uf technology 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw water and

the reliability of the fitted data the correlation coefficient r2 reaches 0 99 2 5 3 electrochemical measurement in present study eis measurements were used to systematically study the membrane solution interface behavior during fouling process and the transfer of charges in the filtration system at different coagulant aids on an electrochemical workstation autolab pgstat 204 as displayed in fig 1 this system made use of the four terminal method which separated the process of current conduction and voltage sensing by using separate pairs of electrodes both the current and voltage electrodes were made of platinum consisting of a platinum wire ring as working electrode a platinum foil counter electrode and a pair of platinum wire as voltage electrodes eis was completed at the open circuit potential ocp scanned over the frequency of 0 1 105 hz for each scan two replicates of eis were obtained the measured data were modeled with nyquist plots which could provide a more direct representation of the membrane fouling process 2 5 4 calculation of membrane fouling to analyze the membrane fouling in detail several fouling resistances were determined ding et al 2017 qu et al 2012 the total fouling ratio reversible irreversible fouling ratios and irreversible index were defined and calculated as given in eqs 1 4 and the characteristic of cleaning the membrane was expressed by eq 5 eq 1 rt 1 jp j1 100 eq 2 rr j2 jp j1 100 eq 3 rir j1 j2 j1 100 eq 4 ii rir rt where jp represents the flux after 6 h of filtration l m2 h j1 represents the pure water flux of the original membrane l m2 h j2 represents the pure water flux after membrane cleaning l m2 h rt represents total fouling ratio rr represents reversible fouling ratio rir represents irreversible fouling ratio and ii represents the proportion of rir in rt eq 5 ec sc s6h where sc represents the characteristic peak integrated area of the target pollutant after cleaning s6h represents the integral characteristic peak area at the corresponding terminal moment the ec was used to represent the cleaning efficiency of membrane fouling the smaller the ec the less the contaminant remains on the membrane surface which means the higher cleaning efficiency 2 5 5 statistical analysis statistical analyses cluster analysis and partial correlation were performed to identify the evolution of the membrane fouling layer and the potential for membrane fouling in the presence of different coagulant aids in the case of multiple samples and multiple variables cluster analysis can be summarized into several categories according to the characteristics of the sample hajigholizadeh and melesse 2017 and the distance between the sample and the sample similarity served as the basis for cluster analysis between groups linkage was used as cluster method and squared euclidean distance was applied to measure the distance of distinct samples the data used for cluster analysis were the raman spectra of the membrane surface at 8 times 0 6 h which had already been standardized partial pearson correlation indicates the independent correlations between two variables under the condition that some other variables are kept invariable partial correlation coefficient r is between 1 and 1 is indicators of linear estimations 1 1 and 0 indicate a perfect negative correlation a perfect positive correlation and the absence of relationship respectively the larger the absolute value of the r the stronger the linear relationship the difference between the two variables is significant often denoted as p 0 05 if p 0 01 the difference between the two variables is considered to be extremely significant and nonsignificant when p 0 05 shen et al 2012 all statistical analyses were carried out using the spss 22 0 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 monitoring the development of membrane fouling layer with coagulant aids by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis 3 1 1 equivalent circuit of ultrafiltration system according to the prior test the removal of ha by the three molecular weight cut off pvdf ultrafiltration membranes was in the degree of large removal removal was over 80 low removal removal was about 50 and very small removal removal was less than 30 when no coagulant aid was added in combination with the properties of the coagulant aid and membrane the synergistic effect was discussed in terms of the molecular weight of the coagulant aid was 160 times 80 times and 16 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane in the following chapters the aim of eis is to simultaneously monitor the accumulation of foulants at the membrane solution interface throughout the uf process after coagulation the real and imaginary impedance data were graphically presented as a nyquist plot which consisted of a number of overlapping semicircles where a single maxwell wagner element producing a semicircular plot the frequency dependent complex impedance can be modeled with a series of circuit elements representing the inner and outer layers of the membrane namely the maxwell wagner model ho et al 2016 according to the mwco of the membrane and the size relationship of the target foulant as shown in fig 2 the equivalent circuit obtained by fitting the eis of the ultrafiltration system correspond to rs c qprp rs qcrc qprp and rs qt rc qprp respectively rs represents the ionic resistance of the interface solution layer rc is the resistance of the corresponding membrane layer and rp is the membrane solution interface resistance which is related to the migration of contaminants and ions at the interface constant phase components qp and qt were used to simulate the interface capacitance and total capacitance these values can be extracted from the equivalent circuit using zview software 3 1 2 the development of membrane fouling layer theoretically the coagulant aid would be completely trapped it was not excluded that coagulant aids with small molecular weight cannot be trapped but the proportion of this part is very small and can be ignored under the three membrane conditions the original nyquist diagram scatter and the fitted data solid line of the cf process were illustrated in fig s3 the variation of equivalent circuit parameters with time was presented in fig 3 in the legend wca without coagulant aids represented the case where no coagulant aid was added when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid was 160 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane rs c decreased gradually from the beginning of filtration to 2 h and then increased with the extension of the filtration time rs c was smaller after using cpam and asa within 2 h before filtration than in the case of no coagulant aid this indicated that cpam and asa can form larger flocs in coagulation so the degree of blockage of membrane pores was relatively slight the channels formed by the looser filter cake layer made k in the solution easier to migrate and the membrane was more conductive however the smaller flocs and a small amount of free ha ha not contained in the floc gradually led to the blockage of membrane pores which was reflected by an increase in interface resistance therefore rp has increased since the beginning of filtration moreover when npam and apam were used rp had a sharper growth rate after 2 h of filtration indicating that irreversible membrane fouling had formed the coagulant aid in this system may mainly affect the membrane fouling by the electrical interference of the side chain groups this was also consistent with the coagulation mechanism of charge neutralization and adsorption bridging that is the coagulant aid with positively charged groups is more conducive to form the flocs with lower fractal dimension and reduce membrane fouling yu et al 2019 xu et al 2019 the filtration resistance of the system was the largest after the addition of npam indicating that the side chain groups of the coagulant aid played an important role in compressing the electric double layer during coagulation interestingly the membrane fouling formed by the inorganic polymeric coagulant aid was the slightest which may be related to the formation of loose filter cake layer due to the structure of asa providing more ha adsorption sites when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid was 80 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane rs was larger than in the absence of coagulant aid and rs gradually increased to a steady state this indicated that the coagulant aid transferred from the coagulation to the uf stage also adsorbed part of the salt ions causing repulsion between them and hindering the transfer of charges and this blocking effect was most obvious in npam and least in apam there was no obvious difference in rc after the addition of the coagulant aid suggesting that the coagulant aid had no significant effect on the charge transfer of the membrane the coagulant aid with negatively charged groups was larger in rp than in the absence of coagulant aid which meant that the trend of membrane fouling was caused by two reasons first the negatively charged coagulant aid was detrimental to the destabilization of the same negatively charged ha during coagulation and thus the filter cake layer had a high porosity cannot be formed with larger flocs this result was not conducive to the transport of salt ions in the interface layer secondly the group on the skeleton polymer chain of flocs that did not connect to ha would have a relatively repulsive bridging effect with the membrane surface which in turn improved the transport of salt ions hoek and menachem 2003 the result indicated that apam and asa ultimately increased the fluid resistance at boundary layer of membrane and hindered charge transfer at the membrane solution interface however the system was in a state in which the spatial structure of the filter cake layer was dominant after adding cpam and npam the ultimate interface resistance was relatively reduced in this system there might be a competitive relationship between the external produced by the floc characteristics and the internal opposite effects produced by the structure of coagulant aid but flocs still played a decisive role from the development of membrane fouling when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid was 16 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane as shown in fig 3 the nyquist diagram in the uf process displayed a different pattern here the two obvious interfaces contained in the nyquist diagram were concerned the membrane resistance decreased until the filtration reached an equilibrium state for 1 h while the membrane solution interfacial layer resistance increased significantly notably rc and rp were greater in the presence of cpam than in the absence of coagulant aid for membrane solution interfacial resistance the increase of the total impedance indicated that the coagulant aid may be surrounded by a large amount of hydrated k on the membrane surface which hinders the migration of ions gao et al 2018 in combination with other types of coagulant aids the results showed that the hydration repelling force between the organic polymer coagulant aids was stronger moreover this mean that the cpam was more likely to have a stronger affinity with the membrane surface through covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds due to the side chain group structure and charge neutralization this led to the development of more compact fouling layer on the membrane surface so the interfacial layer resistance was greater in addition the rp in the presence of npam apam and asa was smaller than that in the absence of coagulant aids and decreased in turn in summary coagulant aids mainly acted as an independent mediator of the filter cake layer and membrane to provide channels for ion transport in this system the different effects in turn change the filter cake layer structure indirectly they may contact the membrane as foulants and indirectly change the structure of the filter cake layer compared with organic polymer inorganic polymer coagulant aid can achieve the best balance of membrane fouling in hydrogen bond attraction and charge repulsion the initial decrease in the charge transfer resistance rc of the membrane layer was attributed to the transport of salt ions to the surface of membrane however the rm with the coagulant aid was still slowly decreasing after 1 h indicating that the ions around the coagulant aid were released and directed toward the pores of the membrane as the cake layer was continuously compacted so the conductivity of the membrane layer increased and the resistance decreased this can also be verified by the opposite trend of rm and rc between npam apam and asa 3 2 tracking the accumulation of contaminants by raman spectroscopy 3 2 1 cluster analysis of on line raman spectroscopy in c uf process based on section 3 1 in addition to the eis monitoring of the membrane fouling layer in the uf the role of target foulants ie ha and polymer coagulant aid in the formation of membrane fouling was simultaneously explored by online raman spectroscopy compared with the five cases of no coagulant aid and four types of coagulant aids the original raman spectra at 8 time points of 0 0 5 h 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 h 5 h and 6 h in the uf process were shown in fig s4 the spectra was applied to record changes in membrane surface functional groups at different degrees of fouling in situ in principle both the target contaminants and the uf membrane will have multiple characteristic peaks in the raman spectrum in order to avoid overlapping of the characteristic peaks with each other a unique raman scattering peak was selected to represent the substance of interest for analysis the characteristic peak appearing around 1379 cm 1 is attributed to the c c vibration of polyaromatic compounds in ha roldán et al 2011 the raman peak near 1242 cm 1 is related to the polyacrylamide iii band degardin et al 2017 the raman peak near 982 cm 1 is the symmetrical stretching vibration of the ho si o bond in the asa halasz et al 2007 the raman peak at 1616 cm 1 and 1729 cm 1 are assigned to the vibration of cc and co in the uf membrane huang et al 2015 which are ignored in this study the peak height and integral area of the characteristic peaks were extracted by gaussian fitting as shown in fig 4 the tree diagram of the system clustering method was displayed in fig 5 which clearly showed the clustering process these data have been compared with the same conditions using the class spacing 5 as the dividing line when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid was 160 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane the whole fouling process was roughly divided into three stages of the initial stage 0 1 h development stage 1 2 h and stabilization stage 2 6 h in all cases after the application of coagulant aids there was no significant difference between the fouling development stage and stabilization stage which showed that the distance between the second and third stage groups decreased the addition of cpam was slightly different from the other three cases indicating that cpam slowly affected the formation of the fouling layer in a gradual manner while the other three types of coagulant aids had little intervention at the later stage of filtration when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid was 80 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane the fouling process was also roughly divided into the initial stage 0 1 h development stage 1 2 h and stabilization stage 2 6 h without coagulant aids only in the presence of cpam the stabilization stage of fouling was delayed this indicated that cpam had the greatest impact on the development of the fouling layer and slowed down the fouling process when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid was 16 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane the fouling process became the initial stage 0 2 h development stage 3 4 h and stabilization stage 5 6 h without the coagulant aid after adding cpam apam and npam the initial stage was shortened after the addition of asa the initial stage 0 1 h was followed directly by the stabilization stage 2 6 h these results indicated that different coagulant aids formed a membrane fouling state at the early stage of c uf and that it did not easily change with filtration in a word the cluster analysis of raman spectroscopy verified the formation of the membrane fouling layer in section 3 1 3 2 2 peak fitting of raman spectroscopy in order to more intuitively compare the accumulation of ha and the coagulant aid on the membrane surface they were extracted from the overall spectrum by peak fitting the integral area of characteristic peak obtained by gaussian fitting changed with the filtration time as depicted in fig 6 when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid was 160 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane comparing the integral area of the characteristic peaks in the stabilization stage they were found to have a large improvement compared with the previous values this indicated that the formation of irreversible fouling caused different degrees of filtration resistance to increase and more flocs containing ha and coagulant aid accumulated on the membrane surface during the stabilization stage the characteristic peak integral area of ha sequentially reduced at a certain time from snpam ha sapam ha swithout coagulant aid ha scpam ha to sasa ha and there was also a consistent trend in the amount of accumulation in other words the coagulant aid and ha were transferred synchronously under this condition the addition of cpam and asa ultimately conduced to reduce irreversible fouling and slow down the membrane fouling according to the change of scoagulant aid sha the relative accumulation of the coagulant aid became larger after development stage indicating that ha gradually caused blockage of the membrane pores when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid was 80 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane the characteristic peak integral area of ha sequentially reduced according to the order of sapam ha sasa ha snpam ha swithout coagulant aid ha and scpam ha at a certain time it is worth noting that the characteristic peak area of ha had a significant increase after initial stage but the change of sha was relatively small after adding npam and cpam combined with the final accumulation of the coagulant aid the membrane fouling formed after the addition of cpam was the slightest overall scoagulant aid sha had a tendency to increase during uf meaning that the coagulant aid and ha were simultaneously transferred under this condition when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid was 16 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane the integral characteristic peak area of ha and cpam was the largest at a certain time and they were the only values that were larger than those without coagulant aids that is to say only the addition of cpam cannot alleviate the membrane fouling it is apparent that sasa ha had a substantial increase in entering the stabilization stage compared to the absence of coagulant aids moreover the scoagulant aid sha showed an alternate trend increase decrease increase when the other three coagulant aids were used and they all reached a stable plateau however scoagulant aid sha decreased sharply after initial stage and then remained stable in the presence of asa this suggested that both ha and coagulant aids can affect each other relatively independently and the asa retained more ha this further explained the cause of the fouling layer in 3 1 2 comparing the changes of membrane specific flux during the c uf fig 7 a stable flux change was observed after 4 h in each of the three cases indicating that a obvious contamination state had formed so on line monitoring by raman spectroscopy and eis provided earlier and more detailed information on the irreversible membrane fouling 3 3 contribution of coagulant aids to membrane fouling 3 3 1 effect of coagulant aid on membrane cleaning in the late stage of filtration the interfacial action in uf had converted from the action between the contaminant membrane into the contaminant contaminant the surface properties and steric hindrance of the contaminated membrane would change liu et al 2016 chen et al 2017b the performance of coagulant aids in membrane fouling removal under different membrane conditions be explored below the characteristic peaks of ha and coagulant aids in the raman spectrum of the membrane surface after washing were extracted and the same peak fitting was adopted as that of section 3 2 2 the cleaning efficiency ec of membrane and the mean roughness ra of the cleaned membrane were measured after 6 h of filtration as depicted as fig 8 when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid is 160 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane the cleaning efficiency of ha was reduced after the addition of the coagulant aid as far as the coagulant aid was concerned cpam was the most unfavorable for the cleaning of ha and the removal of asa after cleaning was the largest in combination with the ra ra was smaller in the presence of coagulant aid than that without it this suggested that the coagulant aid could eventually lead to the formation of a denser fouling layer which was not conducive to membrane cleaning when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid is 80 times larger than the mwco of uf membrane apam minimized the separation of ha from the membrane surface and its own cleaning efficiency was also minimal moreover ra increased dramatically in the presence of apam compared to the absence of coagulant aid this suggested that the fouling layer formed by the close action of apam and ha was very uneven but the binding of apam to the membrane was very strong when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid is 16 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane the cleaning efficiency of ha was the largest after the addition of npam asa had little effect on the cleaning of ha but asa was easiest to clean this was also consistent with our discussion of the membrane fouling process and implied that the effect of inorganic polymer coagulant aid and membrane was the weakest under this condition 3 3 2 partial correlation analysis of membrane fouling the irreversible fouling of the membrane is the biggest obstacle to the long term efficient operation of the cf process the complex interaction between ha coagulant aid and uf membrane resulted in membrane fouling chen et al 2018b in order to eliminate the autocorrelation between ha and coagulant aid partial correlation was further used to explore whether ha or coagulant aid was more important for irreversible fouling under different conditions according to the results of online monitoring 0 5 h 1 h 2 h and 6 h were mainly selected as the time nodes for cleaning of membrane fouling and the corresponding rr rir and rt were calculated one of the raman peak integral areas of ha and coagulant aid was taken as the control variable and then a linear correlation between another variable and ii was explored as given in fig 9 when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid was160 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane the ha and the coagulant aid had different fouling potentials the correlation between ha and ii was very significant r 0 754 p 0 007 0 01 and its correlation with the content of coagulant aid was negligible r 0 581 p 0 061 0 05 this indicated that ha contributed to the formation of irreversible fouling while coagulant aid indirectly affected membrane fouling by regulating the morphology of the flocs when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid is 80 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane it can be noted that the ha was closely related to the ii r 0 917 p 0 001 0 01 and so was the coagulant aid r 0 916 p 0 001 0 01 ha and coagulant aid together caused irreversible fouling but the two actions were reversed it showed that the interaction between coagulant aid and membrane and the effect of coagulant aid on flocs had the favorable side in mitigating membrane fouling which also met the discussion of membrane fouling process in the corresponding section 3 1 2 when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid is 16 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane the correlation between ha and ii was very slight r 0 582 p 0 17 0 05 and the coagulant aid had a significant correlation with ii r 0 8 p 0 031 0 05 in other word the coagulant aid played a dominant role in the irreversible fouling 4 conclusions the coagulant aid with good coagulation effect may not always perform optimally in ultrafiltration stage the role of the coagulant aid in the formation of membrane fouling was determined by the retention characteristics of uf membrane and the interaction of the coagulant aid with foulant which is called the synergistic effect in general the results of raman spectroscopy and eis are consistent for the analysis of membrane fouling but the relationship between the two is progressive or from appearance to internal moreover raman spectroscopy and eis can provide early feedback on the occurrence of fouling by online monitoring coagulant aids would affect the process of the initial stage development stage and stabilization stage of the membrane fouling layer under different membrane conditions when the mwco of the uf membrane is small the coagulant aid mainly affects the membrane fouling by the electrical interference of the side chain groups when the mwco of the membrane is moderate the opposite effect of the external produced by flocs and the internal effect of the coagulant aids structure compete with each other in the final spatial effect and finally the flocs play the decisive role when the mwco of the membrane is large the coagulant aid acts more as a foulant to indirectly change the structure of the filter cake layer and cpam causes the most serious membrane fouling coagulant aids have different performance in membrane cleaning and also affect the removal of ha from the membrane when the molecular weight of the coagulant aid is 160 times larger than the mwco of the uf membrane irreversible fouling of the membrane is mainly caused by ha

18136,microbially influenced corrosion mic is the main cause of metal corrosion in anoxic environments biocides are often dosed to the corrosive media to inhibit and kill the microbes which cause mic in this study intermittent dosages of free nitrous acid fna which was previously found to be a biocide were applied to a simulated water injection system containing carbon steel coupons with mature biofilm to study the effect of fna on mitigation of metal corrosion in each treatment 0 49 mg n l fna was dosed using 200 mg n l nitrite at ph 6 for 24 h the corrosion properties were monitored by open circuit potential ocp electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis linear polarization resistance lpr 3d optical profiling and direct weight measurement the biofilm viability was monitored by measuring cellular atp level the general corrosion rate calculated by weight loss measurement was decreased by up to 31 which was supported by lpr tests and reduced atp levels of the corrosion inducing biofilm the 3d optical profiling results showed that fna decreased the average pitting corrosion rate by 59 with 2 intermittent treatments and 82 day interval over 304 days intermittent dosing of fna has strong potential to be an effective and efficient strategy for controlling mic in oil recovery infrastructure graphical abstract image 1 keywords microbially influenced corrosion sulfate reducing bacteria free nitrous acid pitting corrosion corrosion inhibition 1 introduction in oil and gas extraction water is usually injected into the oil reservoir to maintain pressure and improve production dominique and wolfgang 2011 javaherdashti 2008 the infrastructure used in this process is prone to severe corrosion mainly caused by biofilm formation on the internal surface of pipes corrosion caused by the direct or indirect effects of microorganisms is known as microbially influenced corrosion mic mic is usually responsible for localized corrosion sulfate reducing bacteria srb are ubiquitous in anaerobic environments miller 1970 and are present in the produced water from oilfields srb are generally the dominant microorganisms in the corrosive biofilm inside pipelines kakooei et al 2012 mic threatens the integrity of a pipeline and limits its life span methods to control and mitigate mic include mechanically removing biofilms and treatment with chemicals such as biocides javaherdashti 2008 biocides are chemicals that are effective at concentrations of tens to thousands of ppm in killing bacteria and minimising bacterial growth keasler et al 2011 generally biocides can be divided into two categories 1 oxidising biocides that penetrate and destroy cells and 2 non oxidising biocides which damage the cell membrane or destroy the biological energy processing mechanisms given et al 1997 the commonly used oxidising biocides include chlorine bromine ozone chlorine dioxide among others these chemicals need to be carefully selected in practical applications because they may interact with other chemicals such as corrosion inhibitors or initiate corrosion of structural materials turkiewicz et al 2013 non oxidising biocides such as aldehydes quaternary phosphonium compounds and quaternary ammonium surfactants are less prone to cause corrosion than oxidising biocides kelland 2014 glutaraldehyde is the most commonly used commercial biocide which has advantages over other biocides as it can be used in a wide range of temperatures and ph turkiewicz et al 2013 it could cause 5 log kill on biofilm at 1000 ppm after 2 h treatment or 100 ppm after 24 h treatment keasler et al 2011 tetrakis hydroxymethyl phosphonium sulfate thps is also maturely used in oilfield operations which has low toxicity and dissolves iron sulfide in pipelines mcilwaine 2005 turkiewicz et al 2013 recently free nitrous acid fna i e the protonated form of nitrite has been reported to inhibit at ppb levels a broad range of microbes becoming biocidal at sub ppm to ppm levels jiang et al 2011 vadivelu et al 2006 zhou et al 2008 jiang et al 2011 found that the biocidal effect on sewage biofilms which are mainly composed of srb and methanogens was due to fna rather than nitrite based on this study a new fna dosage strategy for control of sulfide production was developed and applied to several sewer systems in australia jiang et al 2013 jiang and yuan 2013 pure culture studies found that the biocidal effects were multifaceted with the activities of growth respiration and atp generation all inhibited when the sulfate reducing desulfovibrio vulgaris strain was exposed to fna gao et al 2016 the reduction of sulfide production in sewers resulted in reduced emission of h2s from sewage to sewer air thus reducing corrosion of concrete sewer surfaces exposed to sewer air it is noted that this controlling effect is indirect as it is not through the control of the mic biofilm but through the decrease of a key substrate h2s feeding the mic biofilm based on the reported strong biocidal effects of fna on sewer biofilms gao et al 2016 jiang et al 2011 we hypothesise that fna would also be able to deactivate the biofilm in a water injection system however the effect of fna on steel corrosion cannot be directly inferred from previous sewer work due to the more complex nature of metal corrosion metal corrosion in the water injection system occurs in liquid phase rather than in gaseous phase as in a sewer the corrosion process is influenced by many biological and physico chemical processes according to the cathodic depolarization theory srb can accelerate the cathodic polarization by oxidising the molecular hydrogen generated at the cathodic sites on the metal surface javaherdashti 2008 moreover h2s produced by srb could directly interact with iron inducing the anodic reaction of iron dissolution bai et al 2015 srb could also extract electrons directly from fe0 especially when associated with low carbon levels which would cause pitting corrosion underneath the biofilm gu et al 2009 zhong et al 2019 novel marine corrosive types of srb have been found to be capable of using metallic iron as the sole electron donor dinh et al 2004 when srb biofilm forms on a metal surface some deeper parts of the biofilm may lack organic carbon source due to mass transfer limitations this could force srb to turn to fe0 for electrons xu and gu 2014 in fact srb has previously been directly enriched in carbon dioxide bicarbonate buffered medium with metallic iron and sulfate with no other growth substrates hang 2003 further the metal acts as an electrode submerged in the electrolyte thus the corrosion process is also influenced by many other ions such as chloride in the medium for example high cl concentrations were previously found to be favourable for initiation and propagation of pitting corrosion on steel by destroying the passive film on the metal surface malik et al 1992 this study aims to experimentally investigate the effectiveness and the detailed effects of fna dosing in reducing metal corrosion in water injection systems two laboratory scale water injection systems were used in this study one as the experimental system receiving intermittent fna dosing and the other as a control weight loss and 3d optical profiling were used to determine the general and pitting corrosion respectively electrochemical measurements including open circuit potential ocp electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and linear polarization resistance lpr and atp measurements were carried out to reveal the mechanisms involved in corrosion reduction this study potentially delivers a cost effective and environment friendly technology for corrosion control in water injection systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and monitoring protocol three bioreactors were set up to simulate the water injection systems in oil production fig s1 each of the acrylic bioreactors height 150 mm inner diameter 130 mm volume 1 99 l contained 6 removable plastic rods each holding 4 carbon steel coupons yangzhou branch of environmental protection equipment limited 20 10 2 mm the carbon steel used in this study contained by weight 0 43 c 0 58 mn 0 22 si 0 012 p 0 008 s 0 01 cr 0 01 cu 0 01 ni and 98 72 fe the coupons were sanded to a certain degree of surface finish using 600 800 and 1200 grit silicon carbide papers degreased ultrasonically in acetone and then washed with anhydrous ethanol before being stored in a desiccator the coupons were exposed to 30 wattage ultraviolet uv light for 30 min for surface sterilization and then carefully labelled and weighed w 0 prior to being inserted into the reactors each reactor was set up with an electrochemical cell the working electrode was prepared by machining a coupon into a square shape and embedding the coupon in epoxy resin with only one surface exposed 1 cm 1 cm a copper wire was soldered to the coupon for electrical connection a saturated ag agcl electrode and a platinum net were used as the reference electrode and the counter electrode respectively the reactors were seeded with 200 ml produced water collected from an oilfield at mereenie northern territory australia and then fully filled with 1 79 l synthetic seawater see 2 2 for composition for the first 36 days the reactors were run in a batch mode from then onwards the reactors were continuously fed with the synthetic seawater with a peristaltic pump watson marlow pumps 323s at a flow rate of 0 69 ml min providing a hydraulic retention time hrt of 48 h each reactor was continuously stirred with a magnetic stirrer operated at 110 rpm a portable meter oakton 150 was used to monitor the ph in each reactor to determine the fna concentration to be applied to the simulated water system a pre test was conducted on day 238 13 coupons in one of the reactors were sampled aseptically one served as a control and the rest were treated with nitrite at concentrations of 50 100 and 200 mg n l for 3 h 6 h 12 h and 24 h at ph 6 the calculated fna concentrations hno2 n no2 n ka 10ph where ka e 2300 270 t c were 0 12 0 24 and 0 49 mg n l respectively anthonisen et al 1976 the viability of the coupons before and after the treatment was assessed with live dead staining subsequently the fna concentration of 0 49 mg n l and treatment time of 24 h figs s2 and s3 were selected for the in reactor fna dosing this reactor was shut down thereafter with the remaining two reactors serving as the experimental and control reactor respectively on day 244 the feeding pump for the experimental reactor was stopped the ph in the experimental reactor was adjusted to 6 with 1 mol l hcl a nano2 stock solution 394 286 g l of 5 0 ml was then added to the reactor to reach a concentration of 200 mg no2 n l the ph was maintained at 6 in the following 24 h treatment the feed pump was restarted following the 24 h treatment the experimental reactor was allowed to recover for 82 days and the 2nd fna treatment was applied on day 326 with the same procedure however 10 l fresh medium was pumped through the reactor following the 24 h treatment to remove the fna and fully replenish the reactor samples were taken from the reactors 3 to 4 times a week before day 400 and every 10 days thereafter for the measurement of dissolved inorganic sulfur compounds lactate and acetate see 2 8 the atp level in the coupon biofilms was also monitored fortnightly see 2 4 2 2 synthetic produced water a widely used seawater recipe was used for the feed medium comprising per l distilled water nacl 20 0 g na2so4 3 0 g mgcl2 6h2o 3 0 g cacl2 2h2o 0 15 g kcl 0 5 g kh2po4 0 2 g nh4cl 0 3 g nahco3 solution 30 ml trace element 1 ml hubert et al 2003 the nahco3 and trace element solutions were prepared according to widdel and bak 1992 ph was adjusted to 7 2 with a 2 m hcl solution lactate was added to the synthetic seawater at 5 mol l to provide the essential carbon source for microbial growth the synthetic seawater was deoxygenated by sparging with pure nitrogen gas for 3 h before use to keep the system oxygen free a 5 l gas bag containing nitrogen gas was connected to the medium container 2 3 electrochemical measurements the ocp eis lpr tests were conducted with an electrochemical workstation bio logic sas the lpr measurement was carried out every 24 h in the potential range from 0 02 v to 0 02 v vs ocp at a sweep rate of 0 166 mv s to measure the polarization resistance rp which is the slope of the polarization curve eis was conducted every 12 h after ocp reached steady state during eis measurements a small sinusoidal voltage with amplitude v o 10 mv and variable frequency f of 10 2 to 105 hz f ω 2π where ω is the angular frequency was applied to the system and the response current i ω t was measured the impedance z ω t was calculated z v i and nyquist and bode plots were constructed the zview2 software scribner inc was used to fit the eis data with suitable equivalent circuit models 2 4 atp level measurement to measure the cellular atp in the biofilm on the coupon surfaces coupons were carefully sampled aseptically in an anaerobic chamber into 4 ml sterilized phosphate buffered saline pbs 1x ph 7 4 in a 5 ml sterile bottle then the bottle was vortexed for 2 min to disperse the biofilm for the atp tests the bactiter glo microbial cell viability assay promega corporation g8231 was used to measure the atp levels according to the manufacturers instructions a volume of 300 μl of biofilm suspension was transferred to a 96 well flat bottom microplate greiner bio one to bind with 100 μl bactiter glo reagent the plate was then inserted into a multimode plate reader clariostar plus to measure the luminescence after 90 s incubation at 37 c the luminescence was collected as relative light units and converted to atp concentrations nm using a calibration curve made with a known atp standard promega corporation usa filloux et al 2015 2 5 corrosion rate by weight loss corrosion rate was calculated from weight loss measurements the tests were conducted according to astm d 2688 astm international 2015 after the atp level measurement as described in 2 4 the coupons were immersed in the clarke s solution which is a mixture of concentrated hcl 2 antimony trioxide sb2o3 and 5 stannous chloride sncl2 and vortexed for 2 min to remove the surface biofilm and corrosion products javed et al 2015 the coupons were then cleaned thoroughly by sonication for 10 min to remove any remaining debris on the surfaces the coupons were rinsed with distilled water cleaned with anhydrous ethanol and dried under compressed nitrogen gas 99 5 the coupon s initial weight was marked as w 0 and the weight of the cleaned coupon was marked as w n corrosion rate cr in mm y was calculated as c r n 3 65 10 3 w 0 w n ρ a t where cr n is corrosion rate mm y w n is weight of coupon g ρ is density g cm3 a is surface area cm2 and t is immersion time in the simulated water system d 2 6 pit depth analysis with 3d optical profiling following the weight loss measurements described in section 2 5 a 3d optical profiler zeta 300 was used to obtain 3d images to measure the surface roughness of the corroded coupons optical interference profiling is a well established accurate method of measuring height variations on surfaces using the wavelength of light as the ruler chand et al 2011 the bottom and the top of the surface were located by adjusting the focus of the light then the surface was scanned by the light with a step size of 0 2 μm to generate the 3d images the surface depth distribution was generated with the built in software the pitting corrosion depth d n μm was defined as the 90 ile of the depth i e 90 of the depths were below d n the pitting corrosion rate was then calculated as follows p c r n 365 d n t where pcr n is pitting corrosion rate μm y and t is the immersion time of the coupon in the simulated water system d 2 7 live dead staining the biocidal effect of fna at various concentrations was evaluated using live dead staining of biofilm figs s2 and s3 the bacterial cells on the carbon steel coupons were stained using the green fluorescent syto 9 nucleic acid stain and the red fluorescent propidium iodide pi from live dead baclight bacterial viability kits purchased from molecular probes l 7012 invitrogen australia syto 9 stains all bacteria in a population while the pi stain penetrates only those bacteria with damaged membranes thus bacteria with intact cell membranes viable cells are stained green whereas bacteria with damaged membranes dead cells are stained red the coupons were incubated with stain in a dark place for 15 min at room temperature 20 c then each coupon was immersed in fresh synthetic seawater medium to be observed with a 20x water objective lens using a zeiss 510 confocal laser scanning microscopy excitation emission wavelengths were used as follows 488 nm 500 nm for syto 9 and 510 nm 635 nm for pi five images were taken from randomly chosen areas of each sample z stacks were measured at 0 6 μm step size to quantify the live and dead cells the relative abundance of green and red pixels was counted with daime digital image analysis in microbial ecology by holger daimes the viability of the biofilm was represented by the ratio of viable cells to the total cells in the biofilm 2 8 chemical analysis to analyze dissolved inorganic sulfur species 1 5 ml liquid sample from the reactors was filtered 0 22 μm into 0 5 ml preserving solution of sulfide anti oxidant buffer saob keller lehmann et al 2006 samples were then analyzed within 24 h using an ion chromatograph with a uv and conductivity detector dionex ics 2000 1 ml liquid sample taken from the reactors was filtered for fatty acid lactate and acetate analysis using high performance liquid chromatography perkinelmer inc with an hpx 87h 300 mm 7 8 mm biorad aminex ion exclusion hplc column operated at 65 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance before the 1st fna treatment on day 244 the experimental and control reactors were operated under identical conditions and reached relatively stable and comparable states fig 1 lactate was completely consumed in both reactors from approximately 450 mg l in the feed to 0 10 mg l in the effluents fig 1a however the experimental reactor showed slightly higher sulfide production 52 1 1 6 mg s l vs 43 2 0 6 mg s l in control fig 1d which was consistent with a slightly lower level of acetate accumulation 23 7 1 9 mg l vs 32 5 1 1 mg l in control fig 1b these results indicated that srb in the experimental reactor biofilm was slightly more active compared to the control reactor but this level of difference did not cause obvious difference in their atp levels fig 1e the effluent sulfate levels were also comparable between the two reactors following the 1st fna treatment on day 244 the lactate and sulfate concentrations in the experimental reactor peaked on day 247 at approximately 190 mg l fig 1a and 610 mg s l fig 1c respectively as a result of the fresh medium feeding simultaneously the acetate and sulfide concentrations dropped to approximately 0 fig 1b and d indicating low microbial activities of the biofilm in lactate and sulfate conversions the lactate concentration progressively decreased to below 10 mg l in the following 10 days fig 1a in parallel acetate accumulated and peaked after approximately 10 days suggesting recovery of microbial carbon conversion in this period gradually acetate in the experimental reactor decreased to close to the baseline level after around 60 days which was accompanied by an increase in the sulfide concentration fig 1c and a decrease in the sulfate concentration fig 1d indicating the recovery of srb activity in the biofilm in this period the variations in the microbial activities inferred from the organic carbon and inorganic sulfur data were supported by the atp measurement fig 1e atp dropped sharply by more than 80 following the fna treatment and recovered to its baseline level in approximately 30 days this result was in accordance with the live dead staining results obtained in batch treatment fig s2 and fig s3 the biofilm recovered to 90 of baseline activity in approximately one month after the fna treatment in contrast the lactate acetate sulfate and atp levels in the control reactor remained stable at their baseline levels the lower sulfate and acetate and higher sulfide levels in the experimental reactor in the period of day 300 326 suggest that the experimental reactor had a slightly higher srb activity in this period following the 2nd fna treatment the lactate acetate sulfate sulfide and atp profiles fig 1 followed patterns similar to those observed after the 1st treatment but with several notable differences the lactate and sulfate concentrations rose to 433 7 mg l and 673 3 mg s l respectively higher than those observed after the 1st treatment this was a result of the changed feeding regime after the treatment following the 2nd treatment the reactor content was quickly replaced with fresh medium by pumping 10 l of growth medium into the 2 l reactor in 30 min which was followed to normal feeding of 0 5 l d in contrast normal feeding was resumed immediately after the 1st fna treatment similar to the 1st treatment both acetate and sulfide dropped to negligible levels following the treatment but recovered to their baseline levels in 3 4 months the recovery appears to be slower than that observed after the 1st treatment approximately 2 months the difference suggests that the srb activity recovered more slowly after the 2nd treatment which was carried out 82 days after the 1st treatment it is possible that the newly developed srb populations in the biofilm were more susceptible to the biocidal effects of fna however the atp level recovered to the baseline level in approximately one month similar to that observed after the 1st treatment this implies that microorganisms other than srb recovered more rapidly this is consistent with the sharply depleting lactate concentrations and sharply elevating acetate concentrations following the treatment 3 2 general corrosion by weight loss measurements weight loss measurements provides an accurate and reliable indication of the general corrosion rate afolabi et al 2014 lebrini et al 2006 fig 2 shows that the 1st fna treatment decreased the general corrosion rate by 18 6 on average compared to that before fna treatment i e from ca 0 86 mm y to 0 70 mm y the general corrosion rate was kept stable at approx 0 70 mm y during the 82 day interval between the fna treatments after the 2nd fna treatment the general corrosion rate decreased to the lowest level at ca 0 59 mm y 15 days post treatment and it was reduced by 31 4 compared with the baseline level prior to any fna dosing the corrosion rate reached the previous level prior to the 2nd fna treatment on day 408 and it reached the baseline level on day 459 the general corrosion rate in the control remained relatively stable at around 0 85 0 95 mm y which indicated that the changes in the experimental reactor were due to the fna treatments overall both of the fna treatments slowed down the general corrosion rate immediately however the corrosive activity recovered more quickly after the 2nd fna treatment than after the 1st treatment from the above weight loss measurements fna showed moderate inhibitory effects on general corrosion it is noted that the general corrosion rate in the control reactor was slightly higher than that in the experimental reactor with a difference of 0 07 0 06 mm y even before the 1st fna treatment was applied i e when the reactors were operated under theoretically the same conditions however the actual operational conditions such as the feeding flow rate or the mixing conditions may have been slightly different causing the difference in the corrosion rates this small difference does not affect the conclusions drawn above regarding the effect of fna on the general corrosion rate 3 3 3d optical profiling of corroded coupon surface the cumulative distribution of the corrosion depth in experimental and control reactors fig 3 a f was generated based on 3d images with calculation details shown in fig s7 and fig s8 prior to fna treatment on day 183 and day 244 fig 3 a b the cumulative depth distribution increased smoothly vs the depth in both reactors which indicated that no sharp pits were formed on the coupon surfaces on day 244 the corrosion depth in experimental was slightly higher ca 13 μm than that in control fig 3 b g which could be regarded as normal variability between the individual reactors under the same operational conditions on day 326 82 days post the 1st fna treatment and right before the 2nd fna treatment the cumulative distribution started to show uneven increases in the two reactors but it was more obvious in the control reactor fig 3c the pitting depth in control started to surpass that in experimental fig 3 c g and the pitting depth at 90 cumulative distribution increased by 50 6 μm and 8 0 μm from day 244 to day 326 in control and experimental respectively it indicated that the 1st fna treatment inhibited the pitting corrosion in experimental and the inhibition efficiency was approx 84 2 after the 1st fna treatment during the 82 day interval between the fna treatments from then onwards the cumulative distribution increased more unevenly in control than that in experimental fig 3 d f while no deep pits formed in experimental the averaged pitting corrosion rate fig 3h calculated according to the depth at 90 cumulative distribution fig 3g shows that the pitting corrosion rate was generally stable at ca 70 100 μm y throughout the experimental period in the experimental reactor in contrast starting from a similar level the pitting corrosion rate in the control reactor increased approximately linearly from day 244 doubling that in the experimental reactor towards the end of the experimental period the results indicated that 2 intermittent fna treatments at an 82 day interval over 304 days effectively prevented severe pitting from developing in the experimental reactor both pitting depth plots fig 3g and pitting corrosion rate diagrams fig 3h showed that the pitting corrosion accelerated from day 326 in control which indicated that microbes tended to attack subtle areas that were previously corroded on the metal surface as shown in our previous study a dense and compact biofilm formed on the coupon surface could be a barrier for the transfer of carbon substrates from the bulk liquid phase to deep layers of the biofilm zhong et al 2019 the diffusion limitation likely caused low carbon concentrations at the bottom of the biofilm i e the metal surface where srb would turn to fe0 for electrons for substitution triggering more pitting corrosion gu et al 2009 venzlaff et al 2013 in the experimental reactor biofilm was interrupted twice by the fna treatments with much lowered biofilm activity and possibly thinner biofilm following each treatment jiang and yuan 2013 this likely alleviated the diffusion limitation of carbon substrates thus reduced pitting corrosion the results also showed that it is desirable to control and mitigate corrosion at early stages of the corrosion development pitting corrosion is known to be more detrimental to pipeline integrity than general corrosion in the oil recovery operation muthukumar et al 2003 as compared with general corrosion fig 2 pitting corrosion was more effectively controlled by fna treatment fig 3 interestingly the pitting corrosion rates measured in this study were lower than the general corrosion rates measured based on weight loss fig 2 the measuring reference depth 0 on coupon surface was set as the highest point on the surface which varied on different coupons and normally became lower along with immersion thus the pitting results shown were not compared to the initial uncorroded surface level which led to the deviation with the general corrosion results 3 4 fna effect on electrochemical properties of the carbon steel coupons fig 4 a shows that the ocp increased immediately in the experimental reactor to around 0 49 v vs ag agcl after both fna dosages this may have been due to the fna dosing with sudden ph drop to 6 and ions addition including cl and no2 fig s5 it was also found in a study of pipeline steel in simulated soil solutions that ocp increased along with ph decrease from neutral to acidic levels gadala and alfantazi 2014 the ocp of the experimental reactor decreased gradually to around 0 65 v vs ag agcl 50 days after the 1st fna dosage after the 2nd fna treatment the ocp decreased even further to around 0 68 v vs ag agcl in contrast the ocp level in the control was steady at around 0 56 v vs ag agcl over the course of the experiment a more positive potential usually means that the working electrode is less affected by the electrolyte however ocp is influenced by many factors and it does not provide a direct indication of corrosion rate stansbury and buchanan 2000 in fig 4b the linear polarization resistance rp increased sharply after both fna treatments in the experimental reactor because the corrosion rate is generally inversely correlated with rp it can be deduced that the corrosion rate decreased following the fna treatments supporting the results based on weight loss measurement based on the rp values the corrosion rate should have decreased by 53 1 following the 1st fna treatment and by 55 4 after the 2nd fna treatment this indirect measurement of corrosion inhibition was much higher than that calculated by direct weight loss measurement at 31 4 this difference is not uncommon because electrochemical measurements are affected by a number of factors errors including simplification of corrosion reaction processes activation vs concentration difference polarization and selection of conversion factors liu and cheng 2018 the rp in the experimental reactor decreased to the baseline level ca 240 ω cm2 4 weeks after the 1st fna treatment and then gradually increased to reach a steady state at 360 ω cm2 on day 301 however the rp value rapidly increased and remained at a high level ca 700 ω cm2 for more than 4 months after the 2nd fna treatment before it showed signs of decreasing after day 459 the rp in the control slightly increased over the 300 days from 200 ω cm2 to 300 ω cm2 but was otherwise stable as compared with that in the experimental reactor the nyquist plots of the 1st fna treatment are presented in fig 5 a the plots on day 237 before fna treatment were linear with an imaginary impedance z of 40 9 ω cm2 and a real impedance z of 19 6 ω cm2 at 0 01 hz twelve hours after the 1st fna dosage the nyquist plots morphed from a linear shape to an arc shape day 244 5 fig 5a the shape change in the nyquist plots indicated the interface reactions and variations on the coupon surface eis is a powerful analytical technique to describe the physicochemical changes at the interface between the medium and electrode which provides a rapid sensitive and nondestructive platform based on measuring impedance variations ansari et al 2017 su et al 2013 the diameters of the arc shaped plots showed that the plots started to fluctuate from day 244 5 to day 258 and the plot shapes morphed back to linear shaped on day 307 fig 5 a b this indicated that the layers composed of biofilm and corrosion products gradually formed on the surface after the 1st fna treatment until day 307 and started to limit the diffusion of the substrates in the medium to the metal surface the impedance stayed relatively steady as the nyquist plots on day 307 day 320 and day 326 were linear shaped with comparable lengths and slopes fig 5b the bode plots in fig 5e also showed obvious changes in phase angle at frequencies of 10 2 hz to 10 1 hz from day 294 to day 307 indicating that the dominant simulating electrical component in the testing system has changed after the 2nd fna treatment applied on day 326 fig 5b the shape of the nyquist plots remained linear which indicated that although the microbes were likely killed by the 2nd fna treatment fig 1e the structure of the layers on working electrode surface did not change as much as after the 1st fna treatment on day 426 the imaginary part of the impedance z fig 5b began to increase gradually experiencing fluctuations to 148 5 ω cm2 at 0 01 hz this impedance level was maintained for 4 weeks and after day 453 it decreased slowly fig 5f shows that the phase angle did not change as per fig 5e indicating that surface properties were relatively stable with the 2nd fna treatment the absolute impedance at 0 01 hz z fig 5f generally increased and more than doubled from 76 2 ω cm2 on day 320 to 163 7 ω cm2 on day 453 combined these results indicate that a more compact biofilm was established after the 1st fna treatment the impedance of the working electrode in the control fig s4 remained stable from day 249 to day 486 with an imaginary part of 36 2 ω cm2 and a real part of 22 0 ω cm2 at 0 01 hz both imaginary and real impedance were lower than that in experimental fig 5 a b after day 244 1st fna treatment in experimental the impedance in experimental showed a trend of increasing while it stayed relatively stable in control which was in accordance with the lpr results shown in fig 4b two equivalent circuits fig 5g and h were applied to fit the measured eis results to gain a quantitative understanding of the electrochemical parameters on the carbon steel working electrode surface in the experimental reactor in the circuits r s is the solution resistance and r f and q f are the resistance and capacitance of the biofilm respectively w o denotes the finite length warburg flw element the adequacy of the equivalent circuit models was maintained with fitting errors less than 10 for all fitted parameters the working electrode surface was unlikely to be smooth but with microscopic roughness so the constant phase element q a non ideal capacitor was used to fit the distributed capacitance instead of an ideal capacitor the impedance of q z q was calculated using the following equation z q 1 y 0 j ω n where y 0 and n are frequency independent parameters indicating the deviation of the specimen from an ideal capacity and ω is the angular frequency of the alternating voltage in rad s 1 the fitting results are shown in table 1 w r represents the diffusion impedance while w p is an exponential factor w t is the time taken for the substrates to diffuse throughout the system w t is calculated using the following equation w t l 2 d where l cm2 is the diffusion layer thickness and d cm2 s 1 is the diffusion coefficient as shown in table 1 before the 1st fna treatment day 237 and day 244 and up to 3 h after the treatment day 244 125 the reactions on the working electrode surface was dominated by the diffusion limitation as shown in fig 5a so the eis results were fitted by the circuit with the warburg element w o shown in fig 5h three hours after the 1st treatment w r and w t both decreased indicating a decrease in diffusional transport on the working electrode surface the diffusional effect disappeared 12 h after the 1st fna treatment day 244 5 so the results were fitted with the circuit shown in fig 5g where the warburg element w o is replaced with a constant phase element qf and a paralleled resistance rf after the fna treatments the dead cells on the surface of the biofilm were likely sloughed from the coupon surface with vortexing leading to a decrement in biofilm thickness also eliminating the diffusion control effect hernández gayosso et al 2005 the deviation of the double layer capacitance from an ideal capacity n f was in a relatively steady state of approximately 0 82 up to day 248 after which n f dropped gradually to 0 5094 on day 270 indicating that the electrode surface was becoming rough and porous sheng et al 2007 it was also a sign that the biofilm was re developing on the electrode surface the diffusion limitation effect returned from day 307 which was a result of both the re developing biofilm as indicated by increasing biofilm atp levels in fig 1e and the low concentration of available carbon in the medium fig 1a and b from day 307 to day 322 w r around 5 5 6 0 ω cm2 was higher than that 4 1 ω cm2 before the 1st fna treatment which indicated a higher resistance in the electrode surface layer unlike the 1st fna treatment the eis results after the 2nd fna treatment still fitted the circuit shown in fig 5h as the shape of the nyquist plots did not change after day 326 fig 5 b c both w r and w t increased 12 h after the 2nd fna treatment table 1 day 326 5 indicating an increasing resistance and diffusion time according to the pourbaix diagram eh ph for h2s h2o fe iron sulfide precipitations are usually stable at ph 6 ning et al 2015 indicating that the corrosion products remain on the coupon surface instead of dissolve into the reactor medium while the microbial metabolites and the corrosion products remain on the coupon surface the removal of cells forms voids and tunnels that favor adherence of new cells simões et al 2011 after the 1st fna treatment a new layer of biofilm with corrosion products developed on top of the remaining corrosion products resulting in a much thicker layer on the electrode surface before the 2nd fna treatment than that before the 1st fna treatment this may be a contributing factor to the remaining biofilm s diffusion limitation effect after the 2nd fna treatment it is likely that some of the dead cells were decomposed to biomacromolecules such as polysaccharide nakas and klein 1979 attached to the coupon surfaces enhancing the diffusion limitation effect w t and w r stayed at relatively high values up to day 353 and from day 365 the diffusional effect decreased to a level with a lower w t but a higher w r compared with that before the 1st fna treatment on day 237 overall the eis results were consistent with lpr measurements the working electrode surface properties and the dominant reactions revealed by eis analysis supported the general fig 2 and pitting fig 3 corrosion results the electrical components in the equivalent circuits interpreted the mechanisms of the mic process on the steel coupon surface 3 5 potential for fna dosing as a corrosion control technology in this study we demonstrated that intermittent dosing of fna to injected water could significantly reduce the metal corrosion rate in water injection systems with 2 intermittent fna treatments at an 82 day interval over 304 days fna dosing decreased the averaged pitting corrosion rate by a maximum of 58 5 as compared with the control without fna general corrosion was also reduced by up to 31 pitting corrosion is known to be more detrimental to pipeline integrity than general corrosion in the oil recovery operation muthukumar et al 2003 to mitigate corrosion in oilfield infrastructure an intermittent e g monthly fna dosage strategy could be an effective alternative to the currently used organic biocides which are usually applied continuously or by batch treatment every 2 4 weeks oilfieldwiki 2016 papavinasam 2014 the dosing of nitrite to injected water was previously investigated gardner and stewart 2002 without simultaneously lowering ph of the injected water the addition of nitrite at 110 mg n l for 24 h to a continuous flow annular reactor with srb biofilms developed on polycarbonate slides only caused a temporary reduction in the sbr activity which recovered to 90 of the baseline level only 32 h after the dosing gardner and stewart 2002 this was likely due to the fact that fna rather than nitrite was the actual biocidal agent at ph of 7 2 the fna level applied in gardner and stewart 2002 is estimated to be only 0 019 mg n l which is an order of magnitude lower that the fna level used in this study also gardner et al gardner and stewart 2002 only focused on srb activities and did not evaluate the metal corrosion process the fna dosing in this study was achieved through the simultaneous addition of sodium nitrite approximately 450 usd per ton of sodium nitrite powder and hydrochloric acid approximately 150 usd per ton of 32 solution both are commonly available chemicals with relatively low costs in our case the estimated cost for dosing sodium nitrite at 200 mg n l for 24 h applied once a month would be 0 015 usd m3 averaged to the total flow over a year see si for calculation details the in situ ph of oil reservoirs typically ranges from 3 to 7 magot et al 2000 pannekens et al 2019 when ph is lower than 6 the amount of sodium nitrite needed to reach the fna level of 0 49 mg n l would be lower than 200 mg n l and hence the cost for sodium nitrite would be lower than what calculated above if the ph is above 6 hydrochloric acid needs to be added for the upper end of the ph range e g 7 the cost of hydrochloric acid could be up to 0 050 usd m3 yearly averaged see si for calculation details assuming that carbonic acid is saturated the commonly used glutaraldehyde approximately 2000 usd per ton of 50 solution is typically dosed daily or weekly at 50 to 2 500 ppm for up to 4 h in water injection systems company t d c 2012 for which the cost would be 5 to 100 times higher compared to fna based treatment thps approximately 3000 usd per ton of 75 solution is normally dosed continuously at 14 67 ppm in injection water company t d c 2009 15 times more expensive than fna treatment intermittent fna treatment is more economical compared with glutaraldehyde and thps strategies the chemical prices used in the above economic analysis are those listed on the alibaba website see supplementary information as these prices vary from country to country the above cost estimations are indicative only and a full analysis is needed for each case using local prices at the concentration added 0 49 mg n l fna has been shown to be biocidal to microorganisms in both this study and previous studies jiang et al 2011 however fna would be substantially diluted when the injected water reaches reservoirs previous studies have shown that at low concentrations nitrite is biodegradable and would be easily removed by denitrifying organisms with n2 as the final product therefore the fna dosing strategy will not lead to pollution of the injected water this represents a significant advantage of the proposed strategy over some of the commonly used biocides under anaerobic conditions glutaraldehyde was reported to be degraded to 1 5 pentanediol and 3 formyl 6 hydroxy 2 cyclohexene 1 propanal over 123 days instead of mineralized to co2 kahrilas et al 2015 leung 2001 the residue glutaraldehyde and its yields in the environment have toxicity to many freshwater and seawater organisms mcginley et al 2009 this intermittent fna dosing strategy has strong potential to be applied to other anaerobic environments such as marine environments ramírez et al 2016 and cooling water utilities jia et al 2017 where metal corrosion is induced by microbial activities the fna dosing frequency will depend on both the microbial growth rate and the corrosion rate 4 conclusions the inhibitory effect of fna on carbon steel corrosion in a simulated water injection system was investigated in laboratory tests the key findings are fna has strong potential to be an effective method for controlling pitting corrosion in oil recovery infrastructures fna treatment prevents the formation of deep pits on the steel surface fna exerted a moderate effect on slowing the general corrosion rate indicating that a combined approach is essential to fully mitigate corrosion and maintain pipeline integrity intermittent fna dosage is a promising strategy for mic control in anaerobic environments this technology could be cost effective and environment friendly as nitrite is cheap the application is relatively easy compared to coating and the residual nitrite is biodegradable in the system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

18136,microbially influenced corrosion mic is the main cause of metal corrosion in anoxic environments biocides are often dosed to the corrosive media to inhibit and kill the microbes which cause mic in this study intermittent dosages of free nitrous acid fna which was previously found to be a biocide were applied to a simulated water injection system containing carbon steel coupons with mature biofilm to study the effect of fna on mitigation of metal corrosion in each treatment 0 49 mg n l fna was dosed using 200 mg n l nitrite at ph 6 for 24 h the corrosion properties were monitored by open circuit potential ocp electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis linear polarization resistance lpr 3d optical profiling and direct weight measurement the biofilm viability was monitored by measuring cellular atp level the general corrosion rate calculated by weight loss measurement was decreased by up to 31 which was supported by lpr tests and reduced atp levels of the corrosion inducing biofilm the 3d optical profiling results showed that fna decreased the average pitting corrosion rate by 59 with 2 intermittent treatments and 82 day interval over 304 days intermittent dosing of fna has strong potential to be an effective and efficient strategy for controlling mic in oil recovery infrastructure graphical abstract image 1 keywords microbially influenced corrosion sulfate reducing bacteria free nitrous acid pitting corrosion corrosion inhibition 1 introduction in oil and gas extraction water is usually injected into the oil reservoir to maintain pressure and improve production dominique and wolfgang 2011 javaherdashti 2008 the infrastructure used in this process is prone to severe corrosion mainly caused by biofilm formation on the internal surface of pipes corrosion caused by the direct or indirect effects of microorganisms is known as microbially influenced corrosion mic mic is usually responsible for localized corrosion sulfate reducing bacteria srb are ubiquitous in anaerobic environments miller 1970 and are present in the produced water from oilfields srb are generally the dominant microorganisms in the corrosive biofilm inside pipelines kakooei et al 2012 mic threatens the integrity of a pipeline and limits its life span methods to control and mitigate mic include mechanically removing biofilms and treatment with chemicals such as biocides javaherdashti 2008 biocides are chemicals that are effective at concentrations of tens to thousands of ppm in killing bacteria and minimising bacterial growth keasler et al 2011 generally biocides can be divided into two categories 1 oxidising biocides that penetrate and destroy cells and 2 non oxidising biocides which damage the cell membrane or destroy the biological energy processing mechanisms given et al 1997 the commonly used oxidising biocides include chlorine bromine ozone chlorine dioxide among others these chemicals need to be carefully selected in practical applications because they may interact with other chemicals such as corrosion inhibitors or initiate corrosion of structural materials turkiewicz et al 2013 non oxidising biocides such as aldehydes quaternary phosphonium compounds and quaternary ammonium surfactants are less prone to cause corrosion than oxidising biocides kelland 2014 glutaraldehyde is the most commonly used commercial biocide which has advantages over other biocides as it can be used in a wide range of temperatures and ph turkiewicz et al 2013 it could cause 5 log kill on biofilm at 1000 ppm after 2 h treatment or 100 ppm after 24 h treatment keasler et al 2011 tetrakis hydroxymethyl phosphonium sulfate thps is also maturely used in oilfield operations which has low toxicity and dissolves iron sulfide in pipelines mcilwaine 2005 turkiewicz et al 2013 recently free nitrous acid fna i e the protonated form of nitrite has been reported to inhibit at ppb levels a broad range of microbes becoming biocidal at sub ppm to ppm levels jiang et al 2011 vadivelu et al 2006 zhou et al 2008 jiang et al 2011 found that the biocidal effect on sewage biofilms which are mainly composed of srb and methanogens was due to fna rather than nitrite based on this study a new fna dosage strategy for control of sulfide production was developed and applied to several sewer systems in australia jiang et al 2013 jiang and yuan 2013 pure culture studies found that the biocidal effects were multifaceted with the activities of growth respiration and atp generation all inhibited when the sulfate reducing desulfovibrio vulgaris strain was exposed to fna gao et al 2016 the reduction of sulfide production in sewers resulted in reduced emission of h2s from sewage to sewer air thus reducing corrosion of concrete sewer surfaces exposed to sewer air it is noted that this controlling effect is indirect as it is not through the control of the mic biofilm but through the decrease of a key substrate h2s feeding the mic biofilm based on the reported strong biocidal effects of fna on sewer biofilms gao et al 2016 jiang et al 2011 we hypothesise that fna would also be able to deactivate the biofilm in a water injection system however the effect of fna on steel corrosion cannot be directly inferred from previous sewer work due to the more complex nature of metal corrosion metal corrosion in the water injection system occurs in liquid phase rather than in gaseous phase as in a sewer the corrosion process is influenced by many biological and physico chemical processes according to the cathodic depolarization theory srb can accelerate the cathodic polarization by oxidising the molecular hydrogen generated at the cathodic sites on the metal surface javaherdashti 2008 moreover h2s produced by srb could directly interact with iron inducing the anodic reaction of iron dissolution bai et al 2015 srb could also extract electrons directly from fe0 especially when associated with low carbon levels which would cause pitting corrosion underneath the biofilm gu et al 2009 zhong et al 2019 novel marine corrosive types of srb have been found to be capable of using metallic iron as the sole electron donor dinh et al 2004 when srb biofilm forms on a metal surface some deeper parts of the biofilm may lack organic carbon source due to mass transfer limitations this could force srb to turn to fe0 for electrons xu and gu 2014 in fact srb has previously been directly enriched in carbon dioxide bicarbonate buffered medium with metallic iron and sulfate with no other growth substrates hang 2003 further the metal acts as an electrode submerged in the electrolyte thus the corrosion process is also influenced by many other ions such as chloride in the medium for example high cl concentrations were previously found to be favourable for initiation and propagation of pitting corrosion on steel by destroying the passive film on the metal surface malik et al 1992 this study aims to experimentally investigate the effectiveness and the detailed effects of fna dosing in reducing metal corrosion in water injection systems two laboratory scale water injection systems were used in this study one as the experimental system receiving intermittent fna dosing and the other as a control weight loss and 3d optical profiling were used to determine the general and pitting corrosion respectively electrochemical measurements including open circuit potential ocp electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and linear polarization resistance lpr and atp measurements were carried out to reveal the mechanisms involved in corrosion reduction this study potentially delivers a cost effective and environment friendly technology for corrosion control in water injection systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and monitoring protocol three bioreactors were set up to simulate the water injection systems in oil production fig s1 each of the acrylic bioreactors height 150 mm inner diameter 130 mm volume 1 99 l contained 6 removable plastic rods each holding 4 carbon steel coupons yangzhou branch of environmental protection equipment limited 20 10 2 mm the carbon steel used in this study contained by weight 0 43 c 0 58 mn 0 22 si 0 012 p 0 008 s 0 01 cr 0 01 cu 0 01 ni and 98 72 fe the coupons were sanded to a certain degree of surface finish using 600 800 and 1200 grit silicon carbide papers degreased ultrasonically in acetone and then washed with anhydrous ethanol before being stored in a desiccator the coupons were exposed to 30 wattage ultraviolet uv light for 30 min for surface sterilization and then carefully labelled and weighed w 0 prior to being inserted into the reactors each reactor was set up with an electrochemical cell the working electrode was prepared by machining a coupon into a square shape and embedding the coupon in epoxy resin with only one surface exposed 1 cm 1 cm a copper wire was soldered to the coupon for electrical connection a saturated ag agcl electrode and a platinum net were used as the reference electrode and the counter electrode respectively the reactors were seeded with 200 ml produced water collected from an oilfield at mereenie northern territory australia and then fully filled with 1 79 l synthetic seawater see 2 2 for composition for the first 36 days the reactors were run in a batch mode from then onwards the reactors were continuously fed with the synthetic seawater with a peristaltic pump watson marlow pumps 323s at a flow rate of 0 69 ml min providing a hydraulic retention time hrt of 48 h each reactor was continuously stirred with a magnetic stirrer operated at 110 rpm a portable meter oakton 150 was used to monitor the ph in each reactor to determine the fna concentration to be applied to the simulated water system a pre test was conducted on day 238 13 coupons in one of the reactors were sampled aseptically one served as a control and the rest were treated with nitrite at concentrations of 50 100 and 200 mg n l for 3 h 6 h 12 h and 24 h at ph 6 the calculated fna concentrations hno2 n no2 n ka 10ph where ka e 2300 270 t c were 0 12 0 24 and 0 49 mg n l respectively anthonisen et al 1976 the viability of the coupons before and after the treatment was assessed with live dead staining subsequently the fna concentration of 0 49 mg n l and treatment time of 24 h figs s2 and s3 were selected for the in reactor fna dosing this reactor was shut down thereafter with the remaining two reactors serving as the experimental and control reactor respectively on day 244 the feeding pump for the experimental reactor was stopped the ph in the experimental reactor was adjusted to 6 with 1 mol l hcl a nano2 stock solution 394 286 g l of 5 0 ml was then added to the reactor to reach a concentration of 200 mg no2 n l the ph was maintained at 6 in the following 24 h treatment the feed pump was restarted following the 24 h treatment the experimental reactor was allowed to recover for 82 days and the 2nd fna treatment was applied on day 326 with the same procedure however 10 l fresh medium was pumped through the reactor following the 24 h treatment to remove the fna and fully replenish the reactor samples were taken from the reactors 3 to 4 times a week before day 400 and every 10 days thereafter for the measurement of dissolved inorganic sulfur compounds lactate and acetate see 2 8 the atp level in the coupon biofilms was also monitored fortnightly see 2 4 2 2 synthetic produced water a widely used seawater recipe was used for the feed medium comprising per l distilled water nacl 20 0 g na2so4 3 0 g mgcl2 6h2o 3 0 g cacl2 2h2o 0 15 g kcl 0 5 g kh2po4 0 2 g nh4cl 0 3 g nahco3 solution 30 ml trace element 1 ml hubert et al 2003 the nahco3 and trace element solutions were prepared according to widdel and bak 1992 ph was adjusted to 7 2 with a 2 m hcl solution lactate was added to the synthetic seawater at 5 mol l to provide the essential carbon source for microbial growth the synthetic seawater was deoxygenated by sparging with pure nitrogen gas for 3 h before use to keep the system oxygen free a 5 l gas bag containing nitrogen gas was connected to the medium container 2 3 electrochemical measurements the ocp eis lpr tests were conducted with an electrochemical workstation bio logic sas the lpr measurement was carried out every 24 h in the potential range from 0 02 v to 0 02 v vs ocp at a sweep rate of 0 166 mv s to measure the polarization resistance rp which is the slope of the polarization curve eis was conducted every 12 h after ocp reached steady state during eis measurements a small sinusoidal voltage with amplitude v o 10 mv and variable frequency f of 10 2 to 105 hz f ω 2π where ω is the angular frequency was applied to the system and the response current i ω t was measured the impedance z ω t was calculated z v i and nyquist and bode plots were constructed the zview2 software scribner inc was used to fit the eis data with suitable equivalent circuit models 2 4 atp level measurement to measure the cellular atp in the biofilm on the coupon surfaces coupons were carefully sampled aseptically in an anaerobic chamber into 4 ml sterilized phosphate buffered saline pbs 1x ph 7 4 in a 5 ml sterile bottle then the bottle was vortexed for 2 min to disperse the biofilm for the atp tests the bactiter glo microbial cell viability assay promega corporation g8231 was used to measure the atp levels according to the manufacturers instructions a volume of 300 μl of biofilm suspension was transferred to a 96 well flat bottom microplate greiner bio one to bind with 100 μl bactiter glo reagent the plate was then inserted into a multimode plate reader clariostar plus to measure the luminescence after 90 s incubation at 37 c the luminescence was collected as relative light units and converted to atp concentrations nm using a calibration curve made with a known atp standard promega corporation usa filloux et al 2015 2 5 corrosion rate by weight loss corrosion rate was calculated from weight loss measurements the tests were conducted according to astm d 2688 astm international 2015 after the atp level measurement as described in 2 4 the coupons were immersed in the clarke s solution which is a mixture of concentrated hcl 2 antimony trioxide sb2o3 and 5 stannous chloride sncl2 and vortexed for 2 min to remove the surface biofilm and corrosion products javed et al 2015 the coupons were then cleaned thoroughly by sonication for 10 min to remove any remaining debris on the surfaces the coupons were rinsed with distilled water cleaned with anhydrous ethanol and dried under compressed nitrogen gas 99 5 the coupon s initial weight was marked as w 0 and the weight of the cleaned coupon was marked as w n corrosion rate cr in mm y was calculated as c r n 3 65 10 3 w 0 w n ρ a t where cr n is corrosion rate mm y w n is weight of coupon g ρ is density g cm3 a is surface area cm2 and t is immersion time in the simulated water system d 2 6 pit depth analysis with 3d optical profiling following the weight loss measurements described in section 2 5 a 3d optical profiler zeta 300 was used to obtain 3d images to measure the surface roughness of the corroded coupons optical interference profiling is a well established accurate method of measuring height variations on surfaces using the wavelength of light as the ruler chand et al 2011 the bottom and the top of the surface were located by adjusting the focus of the light then the surface was scanned by the light with a step size of 0 2 μm to generate the 3d images the surface depth distribution was generated with the built in software the pitting corrosion depth d n μm was defined as the 90 ile of the depth i e 90 of the depths were below d n the pitting corrosion rate was then calculated as follows p c r n 365 d n t where pcr n is pitting corrosion rate μm y and t is the immersion time of the coupon in the simulated water system d 2 7 live dead staining the biocidal effect of fna at various concentrations was evaluated using live dead staining of biofilm figs s2 and s3 the bacterial cells on the carbon steel coupons were stained using the green fluorescent syto 9 nucleic acid stain and the red fluorescent propidium iodide pi from live dead baclight bacterial viability kits purchased from molecular probes l 7012 invitrogen australia syto 9 stains all bacteria in a population while the pi stain penetrates only those bacteria with damaged membranes thus bacteria with intact cell membranes viable cells are stained green whereas bacteria with damaged membranes dead cells are stained red the coupons were incubated with stain in a dark place for 15 min at room temperature 20 c then each coupon was immersed in fresh synthetic seawater medium to be observed with a 20x water objective lens using a zeiss 510 confocal laser scanning microscopy excitation emission wavelengths were used as follows 488 nm 500 nm for syto 9 and 510 nm 635 nm for pi five images were taken from randomly chosen areas of each sample z stacks were measured at 0 6 μm step size to quantify the live and dead cells the relative abundance of green and red pixels was counted with daime digital image analysis in microbial ecology by holger daimes the viability of the biofilm was represented by the ratio of viable cells to the total cells in the biofilm 2 8 chemical analysis to analyze dissolved inorganic sulfur species 1 5 ml liquid sample from the reactors was filtered 0 22 μm into 0 5 ml preserving solution of sulfide anti oxidant buffer saob keller lehmann et al 2006 samples were then analyzed within 24 h using an ion chromatograph with a uv and conductivity detector dionex ics 2000 1 ml liquid sample taken from the reactors was filtered for fatty acid lactate and acetate analysis using high performance liquid chromatography perkinelmer inc with an hpx 87h 300 mm 7 8 mm biorad aminex ion exclusion hplc column operated at 65 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance before the 1st fna treatment on day 244 the experimental and control reactors were operated under identical conditions and reached relatively stable and comparable states fig 1 lactate was completely consumed in both reactors from approximately 450 mg l in the feed to 0 10 mg l in the effluents fig 1a however the experimental reactor showed slightly higher sulfide production 52 1 1 6 mg s l vs 43 2 0 6 mg s l in control fig 1d which was consistent with a slightly lower level of acetate accumulation 23 7 1 9 mg l vs 32 5 1 1 mg l in control fig 1b these results indicated that srb in the experimental reactor biofilm was slightly more active compared to the control reactor but this level of difference did not cause obvious difference in their atp levels fig 1e the effluent sulfate levels were also comparable between the two reactors following the 1st fna treatment on day 244 the lactate and sulfate concentrations in the experimental reactor peaked on day 247 at approximately 190 mg l fig 1a and 610 mg s l fig 1c respectively as a result of the fresh medium feeding simultaneously the acetate and sulfide concentrations dropped to approximately 0 fig 1b and d indicating low microbial activities of the biofilm in lactate and sulfate conversions the lactate concentration progressively decreased to below 10 mg l in the following 10 days fig 1a in parallel acetate accumulated and peaked after approximately 10 days suggesting recovery of microbial carbon conversion in this period gradually acetate in the experimental reactor decreased to close to the baseline level after around 60 days which was accompanied by an increase in the sulfide concentration fig 1c and a decrease in the sulfate concentration fig 1d indicating the recovery of srb activity in the biofilm in this period the variations in the microbial activities inferred from the organic carbon and inorganic sulfur data were supported by the atp measurement fig 1e atp dropped sharply by more than 80 following the fna treatment and recovered to its baseline level in approximately 30 days this result was in accordance with the live dead staining results obtained in batch treatment fig s2 and fig s3 the biofilm recovered to 90 of baseline activity in approximately one month after the fna treatment in contrast the lactate acetate sulfate and atp levels in the control reactor remained stable at their baseline levels the lower sulfate and acetate and higher sulfide levels in the experimental reactor in the period of day 300 326 suggest that the experimental reactor had a slightly higher srb activity in this period following the 2nd fna treatment the lactate acetate sulfate sulfide and atp profiles fig 1 followed patterns similar to those observed after the 1st treatment but with several notable differences the lactate and sulfate concentrations rose to 433 7 mg l and 673 3 mg s l respectively higher than those observed after the 1st treatment this was a result of the changed feeding regime after the treatment following the 2nd treatment the reactor content was quickly replaced with fresh medium by pumping 10 l of growth medium into the 2 l reactor in 30 min which was followed to normal feeding of 0 5 l d in contrast normal feeding was resumed immediately after the 1st fna treatment similar to the 1st treatment both acetate and sulfide dropped to negligible levels following the treatment but recovered to their baseline levels in 3 4 months the recovery appears to be slower than that observed after the 1st treatment approximately 2 months the difference suggests that the srb activity recovered more slowly after the 2nd treatment which was carried out 82 days after the 1st treatment it is possible that the newly developed srb populations in the biofilm were more susceptible to the biocidal effects of fna however the atp level recovered to the baseline level in approximately one month similar to that observed after the 1st treatment this implies that microorganisms other than srb recovered more rapidly this is consistent with the sharply depleting lactate concentrations and sharply elevating acetate concentrations following the treatment 3 2 general corrosion by weight loss measurements weight loss measurements provides an accurate and reliable indication of the general corrosion rate afolabi et al 2014 lebrini et al 2006 fig 2 shows that the 1st fna treatment decreased the general corrosion rate by 18 6 on average compared to that before fna treatment i e from ca 0 86 mm y to 0 70 mm y the general corrosion rate was kept stable at approx 0 70 mm y during the 82 day interval between the fna treatments after the 2nd fna treatment the general corrosion rate decreased to the lowest level at ca 0 59 mm y 15 days post treatment and it was reduced by 31 4 compared with the baseline level prior to any fna dosing the corrosion rate reached the previous level prior to the 2nd fna treatment on day 408 and it reached the baseline level on day 459 the general corrosion rate in the control remained relatively stable at around 0 85 0 95 mm y which indicated that the changes in the experimental reactor were due to the fna treatments overall both of the fna treatments slowed down the general corrosion rate immediately however the corrosive activity recovered more quickly after the 2nd fna treatment than after the 1st treatment from the above weight loss measurements fna showed moderate inhibitory effects on general corrosion it is noted that the general corrosion rate in the control reactor was slightly higher than that in the experimental reactor with a difference of 0 07 0 06 mm y even before the 1st fna treatment was applied i e when the reactors were operated under theoretically the same conditions however the actual operational conditions such as the feeding flow rate or the mixing conditions may have been slightly different causing the difference in the corrosion rates this small difference does not affect the conclusions drawn above regarding the effect of fna on the general corrosion rate 3 3 3d optical profiling of corroded coupon surface the cumulative distribution of the corrosion depth in experimental and control reactors fig 3 a f was generated based on 3d images with calculation details shown in fig s7 and fig s8 prior to fna treatment on day 183 and day 244 fig 3 a b the cumulative depth distribution increased smoothly vs the depth in both reactors which indicated that no sharp pits were formed on the coupon surfaces on day 244 the corrosion depth in experimental was slightly higher ca 13 μm than that in control fig 3 b g which could be regarded as normal variability between the individual reactors under the same operational conditions on day 326 82 days post the 1st fna treatment and right before the 2nd fna treatment the cumulative distribution started to show uneven increases in the two reactors but it was more obvious in the control reactor fig 3c the pitting depth in control started to surpass that in experimental fig 3 c g and the pitting depth at 90 cumulative distribution increased by 50 6 μm and 8 0 μm from day 244 to day 326 in control and experimental respectively it indicated that the 1st fna treatment inhibited the pitting corrosion in experimental and the inhibition efficiency was approx 84 2 after the 1st fna treatment during the 82 day interval between the fna treatments from then onwards the cumulative distribution increased more unevenly in control than that in experimental fig 3 d f while no deep pits formed in experimental the averaged pitting corrosion rate fig 3h calculated according to the depth at 90 cumulative distribution fig 3g shows that the pitting corrosion rate was generally stable at ca 70 100 μm y throughout the experimental period in the experimental reactor in contrast starting from a similar level the pitting corrosion rate in the control reactor increased approximately linearly from day 244 doubling that in the experimental reactor towards the end of the experimental period the results indicated that 2 intermittent fna treatments at an 82 day interval over 304 days effectively prevented severe pitting from developing in the experimental reactor both pitting depth plots fig 3g and pitting corrosion rate diagrams fig 3h showed that the pitting corrosion accelerated from day 326 in control which indicated that microbes tended to attack subtle areas that were previously corroded on the metal surface as shown in our previous study a dense and compact biofilm formed on the coupon surface could be a barrier for the transfer of carbon substrates from the bulk liquid phase to deep layers of the biofilm zhong et al 2019 the diffusion limitation likely caused low carbon concentrations at the bottom of the biofilm i e the metal surface where srb would turn to fe0 for electrons for substitution triggering more pitting corrosion gu et al 2009 venzlaff et al 2013 in the experimental reactor biofilm was interrupted twice by the fna treatments with much lowered biofilm activity and possibly thinner biofilm following each treatment jiang and yuan 2013 this likely alleviated the diffusion limitation of carbon substrates thus reduced pitting corrosion the results also showed that it is desirable to control and mitigate corrosion at early stages of the corrosion development pitting corrosion is known to be more detrimental to pipeline integrity than general corrosion in the oil recovery operation muthukumar et al 2003 as compared with general corrosion fig 2 pitting corrosion was more effectively controlled by fna treatment fig 3 interestingly the pitting corrosion rates measured in this study were lower than the general corrosion rates measured based on weight loss fig 2 the measuring reference depth 0 on coupon surface was set as the highest point on the surface which varied on different coupons and normally became lower along with immersion thus the pitting results shown were not compared to the initial uncorroded surface level which led to the deviation with the general corrosion results 3 4 fna effect on electrochemical properties of the carbon steel coupons fig 4 a shows that the ocp increased immediately in the experimental reactor to around 0 49 v vs ag agcl after both fna dosages this may have been due to the fna dosing with sudden ph drop to 6 and ions addition including cl and no2 fig s5 it was also found in a study of pipeline steel in simulated soil solutions that ocp increased along with ph decrease from neutral to acidic levels gadala and alfantazi 2014 the ocp of the experimental reactor decreased gradually to around 0 65 v vs ag agcl 50 days after the 1st fna dosage after the 2nd fna treatment the ocp decreased even further to around 0 68 v vs ag agcl in contrast the ocp level in the control was steady at around 0 56 v vs ag agcl over the course of the experiment a more positive potential usually means that the working electrode is less affected by the electrolyte however ocp is influenced by many factors and it does not provide a direct indication of corrosion rate stansbury and buchanan 2000 in fig 4b the linear polarization resistance rp increased sharply after both fna treatments in the experimental reactor because the corrosion rate is generally inversely correlated with rp it can be deduced that the corrosion rate decreased following the fna treatments supporting the results based on weight loss measurement based on the rp values the corrosion rate should have decreased by 53 1 following the 1st fna treatment and by 55 4 after the 2nd fna treatment this indirect measurement of corrosion inhibition was much higher than that calculated by direct weight loss measurement at 31 4 this difference is not uncommon because electrochemical measurements are affected by a number of factors errors including simplification of corrosion reaction processes activation vs concentration difference polarization and selection of conversion factors liu and cheng 2018 the rp in the experimental reactor decreased to the baseline level ca 240 ω cm2 4 weeks after the 1st fna treatment and then gradually increased to reach a steady state at 360 ω cm2 on day 301 however the rp value rapidly increased and remained at a high level ca 700 ω cm2 for more than 4 months after the 2nd fna treatment before it showed signs of decreasing after day 459 the rp in the control slightly increased over the 300 days from 200 ω cm2 to 300 ω cm2 but was otherwise stable as compared with that in the experimental reactor the nyquist plots of the 1st fna treatment are presented in fig 5 a the plots on day 237 before fna treatment were linear with an imaginary impedance z of 40 9 ω cm2 and a real impedance z of 19 6 ω cm2 at 0 01 hz twelve hours after the 1st fna dosage the nyquist plots morphed from a linear shape to an arc shape day 244 5 fig 5a the shape change in the nyquist plots indicated the interface reactions and variations on the coupon surface eis is a powerful analytical technique to describe the physicochemical changes at the interface between the medium and electrode which provides a rapid sensitive and nondestructive platform based on measuring impedance variations ansari et al 2017 su et al 2013 the diameters of the arc shaped plots showed that the plots started to fluctuate from day 244 5 to day 258 and the plot shapes morphed back to linear shaped on day 307 fig 5 a b this indicated that the layers composed of biofilm and corrosion products gradually formed on the surface after the 1st fna treatment until day 307 and started to limit the diffusion of the substrates in the medium to the metal surface the impedance stayed relatively steady as the nyquist plots on day 307 day 320 and day 326 were linear shaped with comparable lengths and slopes fig 5b the bode plots in fig 5e also showed obvious changes in phase angle at frequencies of 10 2 hz to 10 1 hz from day 294 to day 307 indicating that the dominant simulating electrical component in the testing system has changed after the 2nd fna treatment applied on day 326 fig 5b the shape of the nyquist plots remained linear which indicated that although the microbes were likely killed by the 2nd fna treatment fig 1e the structure of the layers on working electrode surface did not change as much as after the 1st fna treatment on day 426 the imaginary part of the impedance z fig 5b began to increase gradually experiencing fluctuations to 148 5 ω cm2 at 0 01 hz this impedance level was maintained for 4 weeks and after day 453 it decreased slowly fig 5f shows that the phase angle did not change as per fig 5e indicating that surface properties were relatively stable with the 2nd fna treatment the absolute impedance at 0 01 hz z fig 5f generally increased and more than doubled from 76 2 ω cm2 on day 320 to 163 7 ω cm2 on day 453 combined these results indicate that a more compact biofilm was established after the 1st fna treatment the impedance of the working electrode in the control fig s4 remained stable from day 249 to day 486 with an imaginary part of 36 2 ω cm2 and a real part of 22 0 ω cm2 at 0 01 hz both imaginary and real impedance were lower than that in experimental fig 5 a b after day 244 1st fna treatment in experimental the impedance in experimental showed a trend of increasing while it stayed relatively stable in control which was in accordance with the lpr results shown in fig 4b two equivalent circuits fig 5g and h were applied to fit the measured eis results to gain a quantitative understanding of the electrochemical parameters on the carbon steel working electrode surface in the experimental reactor in the circuits r s is the solution resistance and r f and q f are the resistance and capacitance of the biofilm respectively w o denotes the finite length warburg flw element the adequacy of the equivalent circuit models was maintained with fitting errors less than 10 for all fitted parameters the working electrode surface was unlikely to be smooth but with microscopic roughness so the constant phase element q a non ideal capacitor was used to fit the distributed capacitance instead of an ideal capacitor the impedance of q z q was calculated using the following equation z q 1 y 0 j ω n where y 0 and n are frequency independent parameters indicating the deviation of the specimen from an ideal capacity and ω is the angular frequency of the alternating voltage in rad s 1 the fitting results are shown in table 1 w r represents the diffusion impedance while w p is an exponential factor w t is the time taken for the substrates to diffuse throughout the system w t is calculated using the following equation w t l 2 d where l cm2 is the diffusion layer thickness and d cm2 s 1 is the diffusion coefficient as shown in table 1 before the 1st fna treatment day 237 and day 244 and up to 3 h after the treatment day 244 125 the reactions on the working electrode surface was dominated by the diffusion limitation as shown in fig 5a so the eis results were fitted by the circuit with the warburg element w o shown in fig 5h three hours after the 1st treatment w r and w t both decreased indicating a decrease in diffusional transport on the working electrode surface the diffusional effect disappeared 12 h after the 1st fna treatment day 244 5 so the results were fitted with the circuit shown in fig 5g where the warburg element w o is replaced with a constant phase element qf and a paralleled resistance rf after the fna treatments the dead cells on the surface of the biofilm were likely sloughed from the coupon surface with vortexing leading to a decrement in biofilm thickness also eliminating the diffusion control effect hernández gayosso et al 2005 the deviation of the double layer capacitance from an ideal capacity n f was in a relatively steady state of approximately 0 82 up to day 248 after which n f dropped gradually to 0 5094 on day 270 indicating that the electrode surface was becoming rough and porous sheng et al 2007 it was also a sign that the biofilm was re developing on the electrode surface the diffusion limitation effect returned from day 307 which was a result of both the re developing biofilm as indicated by increasing biofilm atp levels in fig 1e and the low concentration of available carbon in the medium fig 1a and b from day 307 to day 322 w r around 5 5 6 0 ω cm2 was higher than that 4 1 ω cm2 before the 1st fna treatment which indicated a higher resistance in the electrode surface layer unlike the 1st fna treatment the eis results after the 2nd fna treatment still fitted the circuit shown in fig 5h as the shape of the nyquist plots did not change after day 326 fig 5 b c both w r and w t increased 12 h after the 2nd fna treatment table 1 day 326 5 indicating an increasing resistance and diffusion time according to the pourbaix diagram eh ph for h2s h2o fe iron sulfide precipitations are usually stable at ph 6 ning et al 2015 indicating that the corrosion products remain on the coupon surface instead of dissolve into the reactor medium while the microbial metabolites and the corrosion products remain on the coupon surface the removal of cells forms voids and tunnels that favor adherence of new cells simões et al 2011 after the 1st fna treatment a new layer of biofilm with corrosion products developed on top of the remaining corrosion products resulting in a much thicker layer on the electrode surface before the 2nd fna treatment than that before the 1st fna treatment this may be a contributing factor to the remaining biofilm s diffusion limitation effect after the 2nd fna treatment it is likely that some of the dead cells were decomposed to biomacromolecules such as polysaccharide nakas and klein 1979 attached to the coupon surfaces enhancing the diffusion limitation effect w t and w r stayed at relatively high values up to day 353 and from day 365 the diffusional effect decreased to a level with a lower w t but a higher w r compared with that before the 1st fna treatment on day 237 overall the eis results were consistent with lpr measurements the working electrode surface properties and the dominant reactions revealed by eis analysis supported the general fig 2 and pitting fig 3 corrosion results the electrical components in the equivalent circuits interpreted the mechanisms of the mic process on the steel coupon surface 3 5 potential for fna dosing as a corrosion control technology in this study we demonstrated that intermittent dosing of fna to injected water could significantly reduce the metal corrosion rate in water injection systems with 2 intermittent fna treatments at an 82 day interval over 304 days fna dosing decreased the averaged pitting corrosion rate by a maximum of 58 5 as compared with the control without fna general corrosion was also reduced by up to 31 pitting corrosion is known to be more detrimental to pipeline integrity than general corrosion in the oil recovery operation muthukumar et al 2003 to mitigate corrosion in oilfield infrastructure an intermittent e g monthly fna dosage strategy could be an effective alternative to the currently used organic biocides which are usually applied continuously or by batch treatment every 2 4 weeks oilfieldwiki 2016 papavinasam 2014 the dosing of nitrite to injected water was previously investigated gardner and stewart 2002 without simultaneously lowering ph of the injected water the addition of nitrite at 110 mg n l for 24 h to a continuous flow annular reactor with srb biofilms developed on polycarbonate slides only caused a temporary reduction in the sbr activity which recovered to 90 of the baseline level only 32 h after the dosing gardner and stewart 2002 this was likely due to the fact that fna rather than nitrite was the actual biocidal agent at ph of 7 2 the fna level applied in gardner and stewart 2002 is estimated to be only 0 019 mg n l which is an order of magnitude lower that the fna level used in this study also gardner et al gardner and stewart 2002 only focused on srb activities and did not evaluate the metal corrosion process the fna dosing in this study was achieved through the simultaneous addition of sodium nitrite approximately 450 usd per ton of sodium nitrite powder and hydrochloric acid approximately 150 usd per ton of 32 solution both are commonly available chemicals with relatively low costs in our case the estimated cost for dosing sodium nitrite at 200 mg n l for 24 h applied once a month would be 0 015 usd m3 averaged to the total flow over a year see si for calculation details the in situ ph of oil reservoirs typically ranges from 3 to 7 magot et al 2000 pannekens et al 2019 when ph is lower than 6 the amount of sodium nitrite needed to reach the fna level of 0 49 mg n l would be lower than 200 mg n l and hence the cost for sodium nitrite would be lower than what calculated above if the ph is above 6 hydrochloric acid needs to be added for the upper end of the ph range e g 7 the cost of hydrochloric acid could be up to 0 050 usd m3 yearly averaged see si for calculation details assuming that carbonic acid is saturated the commonly used glutaraldehyde approximately 2000 usd per ton of 50 solution is typically dosed daily or weekly at 50 to 2 500 ppm for up to 4 h in water injection systems company t d c 2012 for which the cost would be 5 to 100 times higher compared to fna based treatment thps approximately 3000 usd per ton of 75 solution is normally dosed continuously at 14 67 ppm in injection water company t d c 2009 15 times more expensive than fna treatment intermittent fna treatment is more economical compared with glutaraldehyde and thps strategies the chemical prices used in the above economic analysis are those listed on the alibaba website see supplementary information as these prices vary from country to country the above cost estimations are indicative only and a full analysis is needed for each case using local prices at the concentration added 0 49 mg n l fna has been shown to be biocidal to microorganisms in both this study and previous studies jiang et al 2011 however fna would be substantially diluted when the injected water reaches reservoirs previous studies have shown that at low concentrations nitrite is biodegradable and would be easily removed by denitrifying organisms with n2 as the final product therefore the fna dosing strategy will not lead to pollution of the injected water this represents a significant advantage of the proposed strategy over some of the commonly used biocides under anaerobic conditions glutaraldehyde was reported to be degraded to 1 5 pentanediol and 3 formyl 6 hydroxy 2 cyclohexene 1 propanal over 123 days instead of mineralized to co2 kahrilas et al 2015 leung 2001 the residue glutaraldehyde and its yields in the environment have toxicity to many freshwater and seawater organisms mcginley et al 2009 this intermittent fna dosing strategy has strong potential to be applied to other anaerobic environments such as marine environments ramírez et al 2016 and cooling water utilities jia et al 2017 where metal corrosion is induced by microbial activities the fna dosing frequency will depend on both the microbial growth rate and the corrosion rate 4 conclusions the inhibitory effect of fna on carbon steel corrosion in a simulated water injection system was investigated in laboratory tests the key findings are fna has strong potential to be an effective method for controlling pitting corrosion in oil recovery infrastructures fna treatment prevents the formation of deep pits on the steel surface fna exerted a moderate effect on slowing the general corrosion rate indicating that a combined approach is essential to fully mitigate corrosion and maintain pipeline integrity intermittent fna dosage is a promising strategy for mic control in anaerobic environments this technology could be cost effective and environment friendly as nitrite is cheap the application is relatively easy compared to coating and the residual nitrite is biodegradable in the system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

18137,photoelectrotrophic denitrification peden using bio hybrids has the potential to remove nitrate no3 from wastewater in an economical and sustainable way as a gas of global concern the mechanisms of nitrous oxide n2o emissions during this novel process remain unclear herein a self photosensitized bio hybrid i e thiobacillus denitrificans cadmium sulfide was constructed and the factors affecting n2o emissions during peden by the bio hybrids were investigated the system was sensitive to the input no3 n and no2 n resulting in changes in the n2o n2 n2o ratio from 1 to 95 in addition to free nitrous acid fna reactive oxidative species ros were a unique factor affecting n2o emission during peden importantly the n2o reduction step exhibited greater susceptibility to the ros than nitrate reduction step the contributions of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 superoxides o2 hydroxyl radicals oh and fna to the inhibition of n2o reduction were 15 0 5 4 1 3 and 70 2 respectively for a reduction of 13 5 mg l no3 n a significant down regulation of the relative transcription of the gene nosz demonstrated that the inhibition of n2o reductase occurred at the gene level this finding has important implications not only for mitigating n2o emissions during the peden process but also for encouraging a reexamination process of n2o emissions in nature particularly in systems in which ros are present during the denitrification process graphical abstract image 1 keywords photoelectrotrophic denitrification nitrous oxide emission reactive oxidative species fna inhibition nitrate pollutant 1 introduction photoelectrotrophic denitrification peden using bio semiconductor hybrids is a novel concept cheng et al 2017 upon irradiation a non phototrophic denitrifier uptakes photo excited electrons instead of an organic or inorganic electron source for denitrification cheng et al 2017 chen et al 2019a this pathway avoids the drawbacks associated with traditional electron sources such as the potential risk of secondary organic pollution mass sludge production and transportation difficulty e g h2 chen et al 2019a moreover the use of organic carbons or h2 results in a costly nitrogen removal process puig et al 2012 solar energy represents a more economical and sustainable way of producing electrons for nitrate no3 reduction than heterotrophic or conventional autotrophic denitrification chen et al 2019a therefore denitrification driven by sunlight has the potential to achieve nitrogen removal in an economical and sustainable manner this process is well suited for no3 removal from oligotrophic water such as no3 polluted surface water secondary effluents of wastewater or seawater which lacks an organic carbon source chen et al 2019a since the peden system is a hybrid system in which a semiconductor is coupled with a microorganism the system is more complex than traditional denitrification systems upon irradiation the semiconductor not only provides photo electrons to the microorganisms but also produces reactive oxidative species ros including holes h hydrogen peroxide h2o2 hydroxyl radicals oh superoxides o2 etc nosaka and nosaka 2017 in addition because no3 no2 also has photochemical properties sunlight is absorbed and ros are produced under irradiation mack and bolton 1999 in addition to the well known toxicity of ros to microorganisms these oxidative species also create an oxidative environment thereby possibly affecting the sensitive n2o reductase song et al 2002 in microbial denitrification the emission of nitrous oxide n2o is an ongoing concern because n2o is a potent greenhouse gas reay et al 2012 normally microbial denitrification goes through four steps namely no3 nitrite no2 nitric oxide no n2o nitrogen n2 where n2 is the end product chen and strous 2013 however due to the sensitivity of n2o reductase an inhibition of n2o reduction often occurs resulting in n2o emissions qu et al 2016 n2o emissions can be caused by high oxygen a low chemical oxygen demand cod n ratio a low ph free nitrous acid fna accumulation or changing operating conditions during wastewater treatment law et al 2012 the phenomenon of fna accumulation was also observed in the peden process however n2o generation does not appear to be solely the result of fna inhibition chen et al 2019a when a self photosensitized thiobacillus denitrificans cadmium sulfide t denitrificans cds bio hybrid was used for denitrification the maximum accumulated fna was 0 0007 mg n l with an input no3 n of 14 mg l chen et al 2019a in this case extremely high purity n2o 96 was produced the accumulated fna concentration was much lower than that in the common denitrification process but with a higher percentage of n2o n scherson et al 2013 lan et al 2019 for example the activity of n2o reductase was inhibited only about 40 50 even when the influent fna was greater than 0 004 mg n l in sulfide based autotrophic denitrification lan et al 2019 besides the accumulated n2o in the t denitrificans cds based denitrification process could not be easily reduced to n2 chen et al 2019a this is in contradiction to the competitive inhibition of n2o reduction by fna which is reversible and is alleviated when no2 is depleted zeng et al 2003 therefore in addition to fna it is very likely that other factors such as ros inhibit n2o reduction during peden however the relationship between n2o emissions and ros has been largely ignored in previous studies resulting in a lack of an understanding of n2o emissions affected by ros in fact the presence of ros and in the denitrification process does not exclusively occur in the peden system but is also common in nature petasne and zika 1987 for example denitrification process commonly occurs in the ocean and high levels of ros h2o2 and o2 due to photochemical process have been detected canfield et al 2010 petasne and zika 1987 more importantly even without irradiation ros can be generated in the dark in sediments at the oxic anoxic interfaces where denitrification also occurs page et al 2012 brune et al 2000 therefore the influence of ros on n2o emission may be a common occurrence an understanding of the mechanisms of n2o emissions in the peden process provides an insight into n2o emissions and their control during denitrification under laboratory conditions and in nature the overall goal of this work is to provide an understanding of the mechanisms of n2o emission in peden using bio hybrids t denitrificans cds was used as a model bio hybrid in peden ros and fna were considered the two important factors affecting n2o emissions during the peden process different concentration of nitrogenous species were analyzed to determine changes in the n2o n2o n2 ratio and to ascertain the factors affecting n2o emissions this method has been frequently used in previous works kampschreur et al 2009 the concentrations of the main ros h2o2 o2 and oh and their contributions to the n2o inhibition were determined the expressions of the denitrifying genes encoding the related denitrifying enzymes were quantified to determine the mechanism of denitrification at the gene level the findings may have important implications not only for mitigating n2o emissions during the peden process but also for helping reexamine the process of n2o emissions in nature particularly in systems in which ros are present during denitrification 2 materials and methods 2 1 development of t denitrificans cds hybrids thiobacillus denitrificans dsm 12475 was purchased from the leibniz institute dsmz german collection of microorganisms and cell cultures the development of the t denitrificans cds hybrids was described in our previous work chen et al 2019a briefly the inoculum was first grown in medium113 table s1 until the optical density od600 of the medium was approximately 0 2 subsequently sterilized and degassed cysteine and cd2 solutions were injected into the medium when the color of the medium changed from opaque white to bright yellow the suspension was centrifuged washed and injected into 20 ml of medium113 m1 table s1 from which nh4cl na2s2o3 and kno3 were removed different electron acceptors no3 n no2 n or n2o n were added based on the requirements when n2o n was used as the electron acceptor the gas in the headspace was first washed with high purity helium 99 999 then a dose of pure n2o 97 another composition is helium gas was injected into the bottle to the required concentration the reaction temperature was 30 c and the initial ph of the solution was 7 1 sodium lactate 0 1 v v was added to each anaerobic bottle as the sacrificial reagent the irradiation was performed using an array composed of 395 5 nm violet leds 3 07 0 14 mw cm 2 the kinetic constants of n2o n or no3 n reduction were calculated following a first order reaction chen et al 2019a 2 2 peden experiments the batch mode peden experiments were performed in medium113 m1 containing different concentration of no3 n 1 1 13 5 mg l or n2o n as the electron acceptor the concentrations of no3 n no2 n n2o n and n2 n during the reaction were analyzed the continuous flow mode peden experiments were performed in medium113 m1 containing a constant concentration of no2 n as an electron acceptor before irradiation different volumes of a sterilized and degassed no2 n solution were injected into the reaction solutions to ensure that the final concentrations of no2 n were 0 0 5 2 3 7 5 15 and 30 mg l then a high concentration of no2 n stock solution 300 mg l was pumped into the bottles via a peristaltic pump 10 9 μl min bt100 1l a longerpump baoding to ensure that the no2 n in solution was constant during peden the concentrations of no2 n n2o n and n2 n during the reaction were analyzed to investigate the effects of the ros on n2o reduction or no3 reduction ch3oh 0 05 v v was added to the medium n2o n or no3 n as an electron acceptor to quench oh during peden similarly 10 mg l catalase was used for quenching h2o2 and 10 mg l superoxide dismutase sod was used for o2 quenching the concentration of n2o n or no3 n during the reaction was analyzed 2 3 effects of cysteine on n2o reduction by t denitrificans the bare t denitrificans od600 approximately 0 2 was first incubated in 0 0 01 0 05 0 1 0 2 and 1 wt of cysteine solutions after a 3 d reaction similar to the time required for bio hybrid formation the t denitrificans was centrifuged washed and injected into 20 ml of medium113 m1 with n2o n as the electron acceptor na2s2o3 was used as electron donors the influence degree γn of n cysteine on n2o n reduction was calculated based on equation 1 1 γn 1 k n k 0 100 where k n is the kinetic constant with n cysteine addition and k 0 is the kinetic constant without cysteine addition 2 4 recovery of rate of n2o reduction from inhibition test 1 without quenching reagents i the t denitrificans cds pellets were injected into medium113 m1 containing 13 5 mg l no3 n solution and were illuminated for 48 h the maximum accumulated fna was 0 002 mg n l ii the t denitrificans cds pellets were injected into medium113 m1 containing 11 mg l no2 n solution equal to

peden a schematic of peden based on t denitrificans cds is shown in fig 1 upon photoexcitation the excited photoelectrons from the cds transfer to the denitrifying enzymes and then reduce no3 to n2 via the intermediates no2 no and n2o the produced holes h in the valence band are quenched by the sacrificial reagents lactate was used in this work the effects of the initial no3 n concentration on n2o emission during peden were investigated first the nitrogenous species including no3 n no2 n n2o n and n2 n were monitored as shown in fig 2 a timely n2o emission was observed when the input no3 n was 1 1 or 2 3 mg l whereas delayed emission of n2o occurred when the input no3 n was higher than 3 4 mg l indicating that the rate of no3 n reduction was higher than that of no2 n reduction the change in the initial no3 n concentration from 1 1 to 13 5 mg l significantly affected the conversion amount of no3 n i e a conversion of no3 n to n2 n from 97 3 to 2 3 and no3 n to n2o n from 0 9 to 52 1 after a 68 h reaction time table s2 the corresponding value of n2o n2o n2 changed from 1 0 to 95 0 in traditional heterotrophic or chemoautotrophic denitrification it was also observed that an increase in the input no3 n resulted in n2o emission alinasfi et al reported that the conversion of no3 n to n2o n increased from 1 to 5 1 when the input no3 n concentration increased from 57 to 133 mg l in a heterotrophic denitrifying activated sludge alinsafi et al 2008 in sulfur based autotrophic denitrification the value of n2o n2o n2 increased from 0 to 25 after increasing the input no3 n concentration from 500 to 2500 mg l park et al 2002 in both studies no2 n accumulation was considered the reason for the n2o emission alinsafi et al 2008 park et al 2002 a higher concentration of no2 n generates more fna thereby inhibiting n2o reduction in this work a positive correlation was also found between the input no3 n concentration and the accumulated no2 n fig s2 as shown in fig s2c when the initial no3 n increased from 1 1 to 13 5 mg l the maximum no2 n concentration increased from 1 03 to 11 2 mg l corresponding to fna from 0 00017 to 0 0019 mg n l n2o was detected even when the maximum fna concentration was only 0 00017 mg n l to determine the role of fna in n2o emission a continuous flow mode process using stable no2 n as electron acceptor was performed 3 2 fna inhibits n2o reduction in continuous flow mode as shown in table s3 the concentration of no2 n and the ph during peden remained relatively stable indicating that the fna concentration in each assay was relatively constant during the reaction when the fna concentration increased from 0 to 0 0036 mg n l the conversion rate of no2 n to n2 n decreased from 60 7 to 10 8 whereas that of no2 n to n2o n increased from 35 9 to 75 7 fig 3 a table s3 the rate of n2o n reduction decreased to approximately 50 when the fna concentration was 0 0003 0 0004 mg n l fig 3b this value is slightly lower than the value reported by zhou et al for a denitrifying phosphorus removal process an fna concentration of 0 0007 0 001 mg n l decreased the n2o reduction activity by 50 zhou et al 2008 however the inhibition of n2o n reduction seemed to occur at a very low fna concentration 0 00004 mg n l fig 3b which was much lower than the reported values in a sulfide driven autotrophic denitrification system 0 0002 mg n l and a denitrifying phosphorus removal process 0 0001 mg n l zhou et al 2008 yang et al 2016 furthermore when the concentration of fna was closed to 0 mg n l 38 1 of n2o n was still generated from no2 n table s3 entry 1 it is possible that the n2o reduction by t denitrificans cds is a slow step because n2o reductase was damaged by cysteine during the formation of bio hybrids as mentioned in our previous work chen et al 2019a to verify that no3 n no2 n and n2o n were used as the electron acceptor respectively fig s3a shows that the kinetic constant of the n2o n reduction via peden by t denitrificans cds was 0 021 h 1 r2 0 97 following a first order reaction which was only 9 5 and 5 8 of the kinetic constant of the no2 n reduction 0 22 h 1 r2 0 99 and no3 n reduction 0 36 h 1 r2 0 98 respectively the much lower reduction rate for n2o n than for no2 n or no3 n explained the easy accumulation of n2o n during the peden process fig 2 moreover figs s3b c also shows that the kinetic constant of the n2o n reduction by t denitrificans greatly decreased from 1 4 h 1 r2 0 99 to 0 0062 h 1 r2 0 99 as the concentrations of cysteine increased from 0 to 1 wt demonstrating the roles of cysteine in n2o reduction in a typical formation process of t denitrificans cds 0 1 cysteine wt was required causing a decrease in the rate of n2o n reduction γ0 1 by approximately 80 fig s3c although the n2o reductase of t denitrificans cds was strongly inhibited by cysteine the bio hybrids were still capable of completely converting no3 n no2 n to n2 n figs 2 and 3 3 3 recovery of rate of n2o reduction from inhibition to further investigate the influence of fna on n2o reduction recovery experiments were performed under saturated condition of fna of approximately 0 002 mg n l fig 3b as shown in fig 4 when the t denitrificans cds pellets were directly soaked in 0 002 mg n l fna solution in the dark for 48 h the obtained t denitrificans cds showed a recovery of 29 8 from 0 0594 to 0 0177 h 1 the recovery was 6 6 and 5 2 times larger than the recovery 4 5 from 0 0594 to 0 0454 h 1 after reducing 11 mg l no2 n 0 002 mg n l fna and the recovery 5 7 from 0 0594 to 0 0034 h 1 after reducing 13 5 mg l no3 n maximum accumulated fna 0 002 mg n l respectively fig 4 this result indicates that fna inhibition is only partly responsible for the inhibition of n2o n reduction during peden the contribution of fna inhibition was 70 2 because the fna concentration was less than 0 002 mg n l in the reduction of 13 5 mg l no3 n or 11 mg l no2 n most of the time in contrast the recovery of rate of n2o n reduction from inhibition was 87 from 0 0594 to 0 0513 h 1 when the initial no3 n concentration was 1 1 mg l fig s4 therefore several conclusions were deduced from these results first in addition to fna inhibition other factors contributed to the inhibition of n2o reduction during the peden process second these influencing factors resulted in lower recovery of rate of n2o reduction from inhibition third the extent of the inhibition of n2o reduction was related to the input concentration of no3 n no2 n 3 4 ros generation during peden the concentrations of the main ros oh h2o2 and o2 were measured after the 48 h peden reaction fig 5 a c shows that the concentrations of oh h2o2 and o2 increased with the input no3 n no2 n indicating that a higher concentration of no3 n no2 n generated more oh h2o2 and o2 in addition more o2 oh and h2o2 formed in the reduction of the equivalent amount of n of no2 n than no3 n in contrast the amount of generated oh h2o2 and o2 were lowest in the reduction of n2o n and the concentrations of these ros were not significantly difference from those of the input n2o n when the concentrations of the input nitrogenous species were lower than 24 mg n l the concentration of oh was in the range of 0 5 0 5 μm whereas the concentration of h2o2 was in the range of 50 350 μm the concentration of o2 in this system could not be calculated precisely because the product generated by the reaction of o2 with nbt was easily adsorbed on the surface of the bio hybrids nosaka and nosaka 2017 therefore the method of nbt was used for a semi quantitative calculation of o2 there are three possible pathways for ros generation in peden system 1 the photo absorption of the nitrogenous species produces ros scholes et al 2019 to verify this the medium113 m1 solutions no bio hybrids containing high low levels of no3 n no2 n n2o n were irradiated for 48 h and the concentration of the generated oh h2o2 and o2 were determined however there was no difference in the oh h2o2 and o2 concentrations compared to the control experiment medium113 m1 only indicating that few ros were generated solely from the nitrogenous species this result is consistent with that of a previous report in which the excitation wavelength of no3 n no2 n was in the uv range normally 350 nm mack and bolton 1999 2 the higher concentration of no3 n or no2 n facilitated the denitrification process producing more nadph and ros based on equations 3 5 clifford and repine 1982 3 the higher concentration of no3 n or no2 n which served as electron donors may have promoted the charge separation of cds producing more e and holes h equations 6 and promoting ros formation equations 3 and 7 wang et al 2019 3 o 2 e nadph o 2 4 2 o 2 sod h 2 o 2 e 5 h 2 o 2 fe 2 oh oh 6 cds h v h e 7 oh h oh the higher generation of ros in the no2 reduction process than the no3 reduction process may have resulted from the faster photoelectron transfer in the no2 n reduction than the no3 n reduction during denitrification process although the rate of no2 n reduction by t denitrificans cds was lower than the rate of no3 n reduction the electron accepting pathways differ for no2 n reduction and no3 n reduction in the reduction of no3 n the electrons are first transferred to the quinone pool and then to no3 reductase whereas in the reduction of no2 n the electrons are transferred to no2 reductase via c type cytochrome chen and strous 2013 the lack of a difference in the ros concentration compared to that of n2o n might be attributed to the fact that the concentrations of n2o n in the liquid phase did not exhibit large differences 3 5 reactive oxidative species inhibit n2o reduction to verify the influences of the ros on n2o reduction different quenching reagents were used to trap the ros immediately during peden using no3 n as the electron acceptor the recovery of rate of n2o reduction from inhibition was evaluated in the presence of ch3oh sod and catalase the recovery of rate of n2o reduction was 5 7 from 0 0594 to 0 0034 h 1 9 9 from 0 0594 to 0 0059 h 1 19 5 from 0 0594 to 0 0116 h 1 respectively fig 5d catalase decomposes h2o2 to o2 equation 8 and sod decomposes o2 to h2o2 equation 4 since the decomposed products o2 and h2o2 are also the inhibitors of n2o reductase the enhanced recovery of rate of n2o reduction after the addition of catalase and sod inferred that 1 the impact of h2o2 on n2o reduction was greater than the impact of equivalent amount of o2 and 2 the impact of o2 on n2o reduction was greater than the impact of equivalent amount of h2o2 therefore the contributions of oh o2 and h2o2 to the inhibition of n2o reduction were 1 3 5 4 and 15 0 respectively in comparison to the recovery 4 5 in the absence of the quenching reagents 8 2 h 2 o 2 catalase o 2 2 h 2 o it was reported that h2o2 appears to cause a rearrangement in the catalytic center tetranuclear cuz 4cu s of n2o reductase and a loss of a part of its copper pauleta et al 2013 haltia et al 2003 thus the depletion of n2o reductase may have been the result of the difficult recovery of the activity of n2o reductase after n2o reductase was exposed to h2o2 the generated oh is also capable of oxidizing cuz however since oh is strongly oxidative it is easily quenched by organic species such as sacrificial reagents which results in lower contributions to the inhibition of n2o reductase than h2o2 or o2 the toxicity of ros to microbe was widely mentioned in previous work clifford and repine 1982 cabiscol català et al 2000 thus it is possible that the generated ros weakened the activity of microbe thereby decreasing the activity of n2o reductase however the influence of the ros on no3 n reduction was significantly different from the influence on n2o n reduction as shown in fig 5e the addition of ch3oh sod catalase increased the rate of no3 n reduction by 29 29 and 37 8 respectively the effects of the three quenching reagents on no3 n reduction were not significantly different in comparison the addition of sod and catalase increased the rate of n2o n reduction by 177 and 226 whereas the addition of ch3oh only increased the rate by 20 this result is in agreement with the results in fig 5d it implies that the ros especially h2o2 and o2 have a larger influence on n2o reductase than on no3 n reductase it is well known that n2o reductase is the most sensitive enzyme among the four n oxide reductases involved in denitrification qu et al 2016 therefore the inhibition of n2o reduction by ros resulted from that n2o reduction step exhibited great susceptibility to the ros rather than the toxicity of ros on microbes it is noteworthy that when n2o n was used as the input nitrogenous species no fna was observed the addition of sod and catalase increased the rates of n2o n reduction 2 7 times from 0 0165 to 0 0458 h 1 and 3 2 times from 0 0165 to 0 0597 h 1 respectively fig 5e in this case the concentration of h2o2 was approximately 50 μm fig 5b the ros had a larger influence on the n2o reduction in the reduction of no3 n no2 n because more ros were generated fig 5a c since the ros were immediately generated upon illumination the inhibition of n2o reduction by the ros always occurs and is inevitable during peden therefore in some cases such as under an inhibitory concentration of fna the ros play a dominant role in inhibiting n2o reduction this is the reason for the larger n2o emissions resulting from a slight increase in the initial no3 n or no2 n concentration at extremely low n levels for example an increase in the fna concentration from 0 to 0 00004 mg n l fig 3b moreover the inhibition of n2o reduction by the ros is non competitive resulting in accumulated damage of n2o reductase and difficult recovery of rate of n2o reduction from inhibition 3 6 mechanism of the inhibition of n2o reduction to confirm the inhibition of n2o reduction occurring at the gene level real time pcr was used to analyze the relative transcription of the denitrifying genes fig 6 a shows that the relative transcription of gene nosz was significantly down regulated from 1 46 0 15 to 1 00 0 05 as the input no3 n increased from 2 3 to 9 0 mg l moreover the up regulation of the relative transcription of nosz was three times higher in the batch with the addition of no3 n 2 25 4 mg l than in the batch with the one dose addition 9 0 mg l strongly supporting the inhibition of n2o reductase in the high concentration no3 n input fig 6b the relative transcription of gene narg was significantly upregulated from 1 00 0 08 to 2 05 0 03 as the input no3 n changed from 2 3 to 9 0 mg l fig 6c it is interesting to find that the relative transcription of the nirb gene which encodes the enzyme of dissimilatory nitrite reduction to ammonium dnra significantly increased from 1 00 0 16 to 2 49 0 18 as the no3 n increased from 2 3 to 9 0 mg l fig 6d this result explains the increase in the production of nh4 n from 0 9 to 52 1 as the no3 n increased from 1 1 to 13 5 mg l table s2 the irreversible inhibition of n2o reduction enables the pathway of dnra and promotes nh4 n production this result is consistent with the results of previous reports which stated that sulfide inhibition of n2o reductase resulted in incomplete denitrification driving the electron flow to nh4 sørensen et al 1980 brunet and garcia gil 1996 in summary the ros pathway 1 and fna pathway 2 are the main factors affecting the inhibition of n2o n reduction during peden fig 7 in the reduction of 13 5 mg l no3 n recovery of rate of n2o reduction was 4 5 the contributions of oh h2o2 and o2 to the inhibition of n2o reduction were 1 3 5 4 and 15 0 respectively the accumulated 11 mg l no2 n produced 0 002 mg n l fna thereby decreasing the activity of n2o reductase 70 2 although fna played the dominant role in the inhibition of n2o reduction at this concentration the ros are dominant in the case of an inhibitory concentration of fna 3 7 implications since peden is a novel concept the mechanism of n2o emission in this process remain unclear in addition to the common sense fna inhibition the ros generated during photochemical reaction represents a unique factor affecting n2o emissions during the peden process the ros not only generate toxicity to microorganisms but more importantly they also have a large impact on n2o reductase which is an oxygen sensitive enzyme although it is well known that o2 inhibits n2o reduction law et al 2012 the ros especially h2o2 and o2 have a larger influence than o2 the ros cause oxidative damage to the structure of n2o reductase resulting in low recovery of the activity of n2o reductase due to inhibition since ros generation during the peden process is inevitable n2o gas is easily generated via during this process n2o purity higher than 95 can be achieved this process is an economical and sustainable method to recover n2o from wastewater treatment in comparison to technologies using reductive iron ii salt or the coupled aerobic anoxic nitrous decomposition operation cando process which are costly and result in mass sludge production zhang et al 2019 the purity of n2o depends on the concentrations of ros therefore higher purity of n2o will be obtained after enhancing input no3 n no2 n or loading of semiconductors in practice however since n2o is a strong greenhouse gas it is necessary to further evaluate the environmental sustainability economic viability and engineering feasibility of recovering energy from n2o zhang et al 2019 on the other hand the n2o emissions during the peden process can be reduced by adding ros quenchers or using sod catalase like materials as coating for bacteria to decompose o2 or h2o2 immediately such as metal organic frameworks as coating for bacteria for cytoprotection ji et al 2018 in this work the concentration of h2o2 was 0 400 μm fig 5b which is in the range of the concentration of ros oh 6 7 2531 μm and h2o2 is the precursor generated by sediments oxygenation in the dark tong et al 2016 the 50 μm h2o2 decreased the rate of n2o reduction by 72 4 from 0 0597 to 0 0165 h 1 therefore ros derived from sediments may also have a large influence on n2o reduction and cause n2o emission it was reported that the rates of h2o2 o2 production induced by sunlight were 6 2 41 0 1011 mol l 1 s 1 and 8 6 22 0 108 mol l 1 s 1 in coastal seawater petasne and zika 1987 these concentrations of ros were much higher than those generated in this work the level of ros induced by sunlight depends on the intensity of sunlight but ros are also generated at the bottom of shallow water such as the coastal sea where they participate in denitrification canfield et al 2010 petasne and zika 1987 therefore the inhibition of ros on n2o reduction may be ubiquitous since the effect of ros on n2o reduction has rarely been investigated natural n2o emissions may have been underestimated the results of this study encourage a reexamination of the process of n2o emissions in nature particularly in systems in which ros are present during the denitrification process 4 conclusion in this work the mechanisms of n2o emission during peden process by bio hybrids were revealed the main conclusions are 1 this work demonstrated in addition to free nitrous acid fna reactive oxidative species ros were a unique factor affecting n2o emission during peden the n2o reduction step exhibited great susceptibility to the ros 2 the contributions of h2o2 o2 oh and fna to the inhibition of n2o reduction were 15 0 5 4 1 3 and 70 2 respectively for a reduction of 13 5 mg l no3 n 3 the system was sensitive to the input no3 n and no2 n resulting in changes in the n2o n2 n2o ratio from 1 to 95 4 a significant down regulation

18137,photoelectrotrophic denitrification peden using bio hybrids has the potential to remove nitrate no3 from wastewater in an economical and sustainable way as a gas of global concern the mechanisms of nitrous oxide n2o emissions during this novel process remain unclear herein a self photosensitized bio hybrid i e thiobacillus denitrificans cadmium sulfide was constructed and the factors affecting n2o emissions during peden by the bio hybrids were investigated the system was sensitive to the input no3 n and no2 n resulting in changes in the n2o n2 n2o ratio from 1 to 95 in addition to free nitrous acid fna reactive oxidative species ros were a unique factor affecting n2o emission during peden importantly the n2o reduction step exhibited greater susceptibility to the ros than nitrate reduction step the contributions of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 superoxides o2 hydroxyl radicals oh and fna to the inhibition of n2o reduction were 15 0 5 4 1 3 and 70 2 respectively for a reduction of 13 5 mg l no3 n a significant down regulation of the relative transcription of the gene nosz demonstrated that the inhibition of n2o reductase occurred at the gene level this finding has important implications not only for mitigating n2o emissions during the peden process but also for encouraging a reexamination process of n2o emissions in nature particularly in systems in which ros are present during the denitrification process graphical abstract image 1 keywords photoelectrotrophic denitrification nitrous oxide emission reactive oxidative species fna inhibition nitrate pollutant 1 introduction photoelectrotrophic denitrification peden using bio semiconductor hybrids is a novel concept cheng et al 2017 upon irradiation a non phototrophic denitrifier uptakes photo excited electrons instead of an organic or inorganic electron source for denitrification cheng et al 2017 chen et al 2019a this pathway avoids the drawbacks associated with traditional electron sources such as the potential risk of secondary organic pollution mass sludge production and transportation difficulty e g h2 chen et al 2019a moreover the use of organic carbons or h2 results in a costly nitrogen removal process puig et al 2012 solar energy represents a more economical and sustainable way of producing electrons for nitrate no3 reduction than heterotrophic or conventional autotrophic denitrification chen et al 2019a therefore denitrification driven by sunlight has the potential to achieve nitrogen removal in an economical and sustainable manner this process is well suited for no3 removal from oligotrophic water such as no3 polluted surface water secondary effluents of wastewater or seawater which lacks an organic carbon source chen et al 2019a since the peden system is a hybrid system in which a semiconductor is coupled with a microorganism the system is more complex than traditional denitrification systems upon irradiation the semiconductor not only provides photo electrons to the microorganisms but also produces reactive oxidative species ros including holes h hydrogen peroxide h2o2 hydroxyl radicals oh superoxides o2 etc nosaka and nosaka 2017 in addition because no3 no2 also has photochemical properties sunlight is absorbed and ros are produced under irradiation mack and bolton 1999 in addition to the well known toxicity of ros to microorganisms these oxidative species also create an oxidative environment thereby possibly affecting the sensitive n2o reductase song et al 2002 in microbial denitrification the emission of nitrous oxide n2o is an ongoing concern because n2o is a potent greenhouse gas reay et al 2012 normally microbial denitrification goes through four steps namely no3 nitrite no2 nitric oxide no n2o nitrogen n2 where n2 is the end product chen and strous 2013 however due to the sensitivity of n2o reductase an inhibition of n2o reduction often occurs resulting in n2o emissions qu et al 2016 n2o emissions can be caused by high oxygen a low chemical oxygen demand cod n ratio a low ph free nitrous acid fna accumulation or changing operating conditions during wastewater treatment law et al 2012 the phenomenon of fna accumulation was also observed in the peden process however n2o generation does not appear to be solely the result of fna inhibition chen et al 2019a when a self photosensitized thiobacillus denitrificans cadmium sulfide t denitrificans cds bio hybrid was used for denitrification the maximum accumulated fna was 0 0007 mg n l with an input no3 n of 14 mg l chen et al 2019a in this case extremely high purity n2o 96 was produced the accumulated fna concentration was much lower than that in the common denitrification process but with a higher percentage of n2o n scherson et al 2013 lan et al 2019 for example the activity of n2o reductase was inhibited only about 40 50 even when the influent fna was greater than 0 004 mg n l in sulfide based autotrophic denitrification lan et al 2019 besides the accumulated n2o in the t denitrificans cds based denitrification process could not be easily reduced to n2 chen et al 2019a this is in contradiction to the competitive inhibition of n2o reduction by fna which is reversible and is alleviated when no2 is depleted zeng et al 2003 therefore in addition to fna it is very likely that other factors such as ros inhibit n2o reduction during peden however the relationship between n2o emissions and ros has been largely ignored in previous studies resulting in a lack of an understanding of n2o emissions affected by ros in fact the presence of ros and in the denitrification process does not exclusively occur in the peden system but is also common in nature petasne and zika 1987 for example denitrification process commonly occurs in the ocean and high levels of ros h2o2 and o2 due to photochemical process have been detected canfield et al 2010 petasne and zika 1987 more importantly even without irradiation ros can be generated in the dark in sediments at the oxic anoxic interfaces where denitrification also occurs page et al 2012 brune et al 2000 therefore the influence of ros on n2o emission may be a common occurrence an understanding of the mechanisms of n2o emissions in the peden process provides an insight into n2o emissions and their control during denitrification under laboratory conditions and in nature the overall goal of this work is to provide an understanding of the mechanisms of n2o emission in peden using bio hybrids t denitrificans cds was used as a model bio hybrid in peden ros and fna were considered the two important factors affecting n2o emissions during the peden process different concentration of nitrogenous species were analyzed to determine changes in the n2o n2o n2 ratio and to ascertain the factors affecting n2o emissions this method has been frequently used in previous works kampschreur et al 2009 the concentrations of the main ros h2o2 o2 and oh and their contributions to the n2o inhibition were determined the expressions of the denitrifying genes encoding the related denitrifying enzymes were quantified to determine the mechanism of denitrification at the gene level the findings may have important implications not only for mitigating n2o emissions during the peden process but also for helping reexamine the process of n2o emissions in nature particularly in systems in which ros are present during denitrification 2 materials and methods 2 1 development of t denitrificans cds hybrids thiobacillus denitrificans dsm 12475 was purchased from the leibniz institute dsmz german collection of microorganisms and cell cultures the development of the t denitrificans cds hybrids was described in our previous work chen et al 2019a briefly the inoculum was first grown in medium113 table s1 until the optical density od600 of the medium was approximately 0 2 subsequently sterilized and degassed cysteine and cd2 solutions were injected into the medium when

experiments were conducted in triplicate the concentration of oh that was formed during peden was measured using the terephthalic acid method barreto et al 1994 the intensity of fluorescence of the

the standard curves in the measurements of oh and h2o2 have been provided in fig s1a and fig s1b respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of input no3 n concentration on n2o emission during peden a schematic of peden based on t denitrificans cds is shown in fig 1 upon photoexcitation the excited photoelectrons from the cds transfer to the denitrifying enzymes and then reduce no3 to n2 via the intermediates no2 no and n2o the produced holes h in the valence band are quenched by the sacrificial reagents lactate was used in this work the effects of the initial no3 n concentration on n2o emission during peden were investigated first the nitrogenous species including no3 n no2 n n2o n and n2 n were monitored as shown in fig 2 a timely n2o emission was observed when the input no3 n was 1 1 or 2 3 mg l whereas delayed emission of n2o occurred when the input no3 n was higher than 3 4 mg l indicating that the rate of no3 n reduction was higher than that of no2 n reduction the change in the initial no3 n concentration from 1 1 to 13 5 mg l significantly affected the conversion amount of no3 n i e a conversion of no3 n to n2 n from 97 3 to 2 3 and no3 n to n2o n from 0 9 to 52 1 after a 68 h reaction time table s2 the corresponding value of n2o n2o n2 changed from 1 0 to 95 0 in traditional heterotrophic or chemoautotrophic denitrification it was also observed that an increase in the input no3 n resulted in n2o emission alinasfi et al reported that the conversion of no3 n to n2o n increased from 1 to 5 1 when the input no3 n concentration increased from 57 to 133 mg l in a heterotrophic denitrifying activated sludge alinsafi et al 2008 in sulfur based autotrophic denitrification the value of n2o n2o n2 increased from 0 to 25 after increasing the input no3 n concentration from 500 to 2500 mg l park et al 2002 in both studies no2 n accumulation was considered the reason for the n2o emission alinsafi et al 2008 park et al 2002 a higher concentration of no2 n generates more fna thereby inhibiting n2o reduction in this work a positive correlation was also found between the input no3 n concentration and the accumulated no2 n fig s2 as shown in fig s2c when the initial no3 n increased from 1 1 to 13 5 mg l the maximum no2 n concentration increased from 1 03 to 11 2 mg l corresponding to fna from 0 00017 to 0 0019 mg n l n2o was detected even when the maximum fna concentration was only 0 00017 mg n l to determine the role of fna in n2o emission a continuous flow mode process using stable no2 n as electron acceptor was performed 3 2 fna inhibits n2o reduction in continuous flow mode as shown in table s3 the concentration of no2 n and the ph during peden remained relatively stable indicating that the fna concentration in each assay was relatively constant during the reaction when the fna concentration increased from 0 to 0 0036 mg n l the conversion rate of no2 n to n2 n decreased from 60 7 to 10 8 whereas that of no2 n to n2o n increased from 35 9 to 75 7 fig 3 a table s3 the rate of n2o n reduction decreased to approximately 50 when the fna concentration was 0 0003 0 0004 mg n l fig 3b this value is slightly lower than the value reported by zhou et al for a denitrifying phosphorus removal process an fna concentration of 0 0007 0 001 mg n l decreased the n2o reduction activity by 50 zhou et al 2008 however the inhibition of n2o n reduction seemed to occur at a very low fna concentration 0 00004 mg n l fig 3b which was much lower than the reported values in a sulfide driven autotrophic denitrification system 0 0002 mg n l and a denitrifying phosphorus removal process 0 0001 mg n l zhou et al 2008 yang et al 2016 furthermore when the concentration of fna was closed to 0 mg n l 38 1 of n2o n was still generated from no2 n table s3 entry 1 it is possible that the n2o reduction by t denitrificans cds is a slow step because n2o reductase was damaged by cysteine during the formation of bio hybrids as mentioned in our previous work chen et al 2019a to verify that no3 n no2 n and n2o n were used as the electron acceptor respectively fig s3a shows that the kinetic constant of the n2o n reduction via peden by t denitrificans cds was 0 021 h 1 r2 0 97 following a first order reaction which was only 9 5 and 5 8 of the kinetic constant of the no2 n reduction 0 22 h 1 r2 0 99 and no3 n reduction 0 36 h 1 r2 0 98 respectively the much lower reduction rate for n2o n than for no2 n or no3 n explained the easy accumulation of n2o n during the peden process fig 2 moreover figs s3b c also shows that the kinetic constant of the n2o n reduction by t denitrificans greatly decreased from 1 4 h 1 r2 0 99 to 0 0062 h 1 r2 0 99 as the concentrations of cysteine increased from 0 to 1 wt demonstrating the roles of cysteine in n2o reduction in a typical formation process of t denitrificans cds 0 1 cysteine wt was required causing a decrease in the rate of n2o n reduction γ0 1 by approximately 80 fig s3c although the n2o reductase of t denitrificans cds was strongly inhibited by cysteine the bio hybrids were still capable of completely converting no3 n no2 n to n2 n figs 2 and 3 3 3 recovery of rate of n2o reduction from inhibition to further investigate the influence of fna on n2o reduction recovery experiments were performed under saturated condition of fna of approximately 0 002 mg n l fig 3b as shown in fig 4 when the t denitrificans cds pellets were directly soaked in 0 002 mg n l fna solution in the dark for 48 h the obtained t denitrificans cds showed a recovery of 29 8 from 0 0594 to 0 0177 h 1 the recovery was 6 6 and 5 2 times larger than the recovery 4 5 from 0 0594 to 0 0454 h 1 after reducing 11 mg l no2 n 0 002 mg n l fna and the recovery 5 7 from 0 0594 to 0 0034 h 1 after reducing 13 5 mg l no3 n maximum accumulated fna 0 002 mg n l respectively fig 4 this result indicates that fna inhibition is only partly responsible for the inhibition of n2o n reduction during peden the contribution of fna inhibition was 70 2 because the fna concentration was less than 0 002 mg n l in the reduction of 13 5 mg l no3 n or 11 mg l no2 n most of the time in contrast the recovery of rate of n2o n reduction from inhibition was 87 from 0 0594 to 0 0513 h 1 when the initial no3 n concentration was 1 1 mg l fig s4 therefore several conclusions were deduced from these results first in addition to fna inhibition other factors contributed to the inhibition of n2o reduction during the peden process second these influencing factors resulted in lower recovery of rate of n2o reduction from inhibition third the extent of the inhibition of n2o reduction was related to the input concentration of no3 n no2 n 3 4 ros generation during peden the concentrations of the main ros oh h2o2 and o2 were measured after the 48 h peden reaction fig 5 a c shows that the concentrations of oh h2o2 and o2 increased with the input no3 n no2 n indicating that a higher concentration of no3 n no2 n generated more oh h2o2 and o2 in addition more o2 oh and h2o2 formed in the reduction of the equivalent amount of n of no2 n than no3 n in contrast the amount of generated oh h2o2 and o2 were lowest in the reduction of n2o n and the concentrations of these ros were not significantly difference from those of the input n2o n when the concentrations of the input nitrogenous species were lower than 24 mg n l the concentration of oh was in the range of 0 5 0 5 μm whereas the concentration of h2o2 was in the range of 50 350 μm the concentration of o2 in this system could not be calculated precisely because the product generated by the reaction of o2 with nbt was easily adsorbed on the surface of the bio hybrids nosaka and nosaka 2017 therefore the method of nbt was used for a semi quantitative calculation of o2 there are three possible pathways for ros generation in peden system 1 the photo absorption of the nitrogenous species produces ros scholes et al 2019 to verify this the medium113 m1 solutions no bio hybrids containing high low levels of no3 n no2 n n2o n were irradiated for 48 h and the concentration of the generated oh h2o2 and o2 were determined however there was no difference in the oh h2o2 and o2 concentrations compared to the control experiment medium113 m1 only indicating that few ros were generated solely from the nitrogenous species this result is consistent with that of a previous report in which the excitation wavelength of no3 n no2 n was in the uv range normally 350 nm mack and bolton 1999 2 the higher concentration of no3 n or no2 n facilitated the denitrification process producing more nadph and ros based on equations 3 5 clifford and repine 1982 3 the higher concentration of no3 n or no2 n which served as electron donors may have promoted the charge separation of cds producing more e and holes h equations 6 and promoting ros formation equations 3 and 7 wang et al 2019 3 o 2 e nadph o 2 4 2 o 2 sod h 2 o 2 e 5 h 2 o 2 fe 2 oh oh 6 cds h v h e 7 oh h oh the higher generation of ros in the no2 reduction process than the no3 reduction process may have resulted from the faster photoelectron transfer in the no2 n reduction than the no3 n reduction during denitrification process although the rate of no2 n reduction by t denitrificans cds was lower than the rate of no3 n reduction the electron accepting pathways differ for no2 n reduction and no3 n reduction in the reduction of no3 n the electrons are first transferred to the quinone pool and then to no3 reductase whereas in the reduction of no2 n the electrons are transferred to no2 reductase via c type cytochrome chen and strous 2013 the lack of a difference in the ros concentration compared to that of n2o n might be attributed to the fact that the concentrations of n2o n in the liquid phase did not exhibit large differences 3 5 reactive oxidative species inhibit n2o reduction to verify the influences of the ros on n2o reduction different quenching reagents were used to trap the ros immediately during peden using no3 n as the electron acceptor the recovery of rate of n2o reduction from inhibition was evaluated in the presence of ch3oh sod and catalase the recovery of rate of n2o reduction was 5 7 from 0 0594 to 0 0034 h 1 9 9 from 0 0594 to 0 0059 h 1 19 5 from 0 0594 to 0 0116 h 1 respectively fig 5d catalase decomposes h2o2 to o2 equation 8 and sod decomposes o2 to h2o2 equation 4 since the decomposed products o2 and h2o2 are also the inhibitors of n2o reductase the enhanced recovery of rate of n2o reduction after the addition of catalase and sod inferred that 1 the impact of h2o2 on n2o reduction was greater than the impact of equivalent amount of o2 and 2 the impact of o2 on n2o reduction was greater than the impact of equivalent amount of h2o2 therefore the contributions of oh o2 and h2o2 to the inhibition of n2o reduction were 1 3 5 4 and 15 0 respectively in comparison to the recovery 4 5 in the absence of the quenching reagents 8 2 h 2 o 2 catalase o 2 2 h 2 o it was reported that h2o2 appears to cause a rearrangement in the catalytic center tetranuclear cuz 4cu s of n2o reductase and a loss of a part of its copper pauleta et al 2013 haltia et al 2003 thus the depletion of n2o reductase may have been the result of the difficult recovery of the activity of n2o reductase after n2o reductase was exposed to h2o2 the generated oh is also capable of oxidizing cuz however since oh is strongly oxidative it is easily quenched by organic species such as sacrificial reagents which results in lower contributions to the inhibition of n2o reductase than h2o2 or o2 the toxicity of ros to microbe was widely mentioned in previous work clifford and repine 1982 cabiscol català et al 2000 thus it is possible that the generated ros weakened the activity of microbe thereby decreasing the activity of n2o reductase however the influence of the ros on no3 n reduction was significantly different from the influence on n2o n reduction as shown in fig 5e the addition of ch3oh sod catalase increased the rate of no3 n reduction by 29 29 and 37 8 respectively the effects of the three quenching reagents on no3 n reduction were not significantly different in comparison the addition of sod and catalase increased the rate of n2o n reduction by 177 and 226 whereas the addition of ch3oh only increased the rate by 20 this result is in agreement with the results in fig 5d it implies that the ros especially h2o2 and o2 have a larger influence on n2o reductase than on no3 n reductase it is well known that n2o reductase is the most sensitive enzyme among the four n oxide reductases involved in denitrification qu et al 2016 therefore the inhibition of n2o reduction by ros resulted from that n2o reduction step exhibited great susceptibility to the ros rather than the toxicity of ros on microbes it is noteworthy that when n2o n was used as the input nitrogenous species no fna was observed the addition of sod and catalase increased the rates of n2o n reduction 2 7 times from 0 0165 to 0 0458 h 1 and 3 2 times from 0 0165 to 0 0597 h 1 respectively fig 5e in this case the concentration of h2o2 was approximately 50 μm fig 5b the ros had a larger influence on the n2o reduction in the reduction of no3 n no2 n because more ros were generated fig 5a c since the ros were immediately generated upon illumination the inhibition of n2o reduction by the ros always occurs and is inevitable during peden therefore in some cases such as under an inhibitory concentration of fna the ros play a dominant role in inhibiting n2o reduction this is the reason for the larger n2o emissions resulting from a slight increase in the initial no3 n or no2 n concentration at extremely low n levels for example an increase in the fna concentration from 0 to 0 00004 mg n l fig 3b moreover the inhibition of n2o reduction by the ros is non competitive resulting in accumulated damage of n2o reductase and difficult recovery of rate of n2o reduction from inhibition 3 6 mechanism of the inhibition of n2o reduction to confirm the inhibition of n2o reduction occurring at the gene level real time pcr was used to analyze the relative transcription of the denitrifying genes fig 6 a shows that the relative transcription of gene nosz was significantly down regulated from 1 46 0 15 to 1 00 0 05 as the input no3 n increased from 2 3 to 9 0 mg l moreover the up regulation of the relative transcription of nosz was three times higher in the batch with the addition of no3 n 2 25 4 mg l than in the batch with the one dose addition 9 0 mg l strongly supporting the inhibition of n2o reductase in the high concentration no3 n input fig 6b the relative transcription of gene narg was significantly upregulated from 1 00 0 08 to 2 05 0 03 as the input no3 n changed from 2 3 to 9 0 mg l fig 6c it is interesting to find that the relative transcription of the nirb gene which encodes the enzyme of dissimilatory nitrite reduction to ammonium dnra significantly increased from 1 00 0 16 to 2 49 0 18 as the no3 n increased from 2 3 to 9 0 mg l fig 6d this result explains the increase in the production of nh4 n from 0 9 to 52 1 as the no3 n increased from 1 1 to 13 5 mg l table s2 the irreversible inhibition of n2o reduction enables the pathway of dnra and promotes nh4 n production this result is consistent with the results of previous reports which stated that sulfide inhibition of n2o reductase resulted in incomplete denitrification driving the electron flow to nh4 sørensen et al 1980 brunet and garcia gil 1996 in summary the ros pathway 1 and fna pathway 2 are the main factors affecting the inhibition of n2o n reduction during peden fig 7 in the reduction of 13 5 mg l no3 n recovery of rate of n2o reduction was 4 5 the contributions of oh h2o2 and o2 to the inhibition of n2o reduction were 1 3 5 4 and 15 0 respectively the accumulated 11 mg l no2 n produced 0 002 mg n l fna thereby decreasing the activity of n2o reductase 70 2 although fna played the dominant role in the inhibition of n2o reduction at this concentration the ros are dominant in the case of an inhibitory concentration of fna 3 7 implications since peden is a novel concept the mechanism of n2o emission in this process remain unclear in addition to the common sense fna inhibition the ros generated during photochemical reaction represents a unique factor affecting n2o emissions during the peden process the ros not only generate toxicity to microorganisms but more importantly they also have a large impact on n2o reductase which is an oxygen sensitive enzyme although it is well known that o2 inhibits n2o reduction law et al 2012 the ros especially h2o2 and o2 have a larger influence than o2 the ros cause oxidative damage to the structure of n2o reductase resulting in low recovery of the activity of n2o reductase due to inhibition since ros generation during the peden process is inevitable n2o gas is easily generated via during this process n2o purity higher than 95 can be achieved this process is an economical and sustainable method to recover n2o from wastewater treatment in comparison to technologies using reductive iron ii salt or the coupled aerobic anoxic nitrous decomposition operation cando process which are costly and result in mass sludge production zhang et al 2019 the purity of n2o depends on the concentrations of ros therefore higher purity of n2o will be obtained after enhancing input no3 n no2 n or loading of semiconductors in practice however since n2o is a strong greenhouse gas it is necessary to further evaluate the environmental sustainability economic viability and engineering feasibility of recovering energy from n2o zhang et al 2019 on the other hand the n2o emissions during the peden process can be reduced by adding ros quenchers or using sod catalase like materials as coating for bacteria to decompose o2 or h2o2 immediately such as metal organic frameworks as coating for bacteria for cytoprotection ji et al 2018 in this work the concentration of h2o2 was 0 400 μm fig 5b which is in the range of the concentration of ros oh 6 7 2531 μm and h2o2 is the precursor generated by sediments oxygenation in the dark tong et al 2016 the 50 μm h2o2 decreased the rate of n2o reduction by 72 4 from 0 0597 to 0 0165 h 1 therefore ros derived from sediments may also have a large influence on n2o reduction and cause n2o emission it was reported that the rates of h2o2 o2 production induced by sunlight were 6 2 41 0 1011 mol l 1 s 1 and 8 6 22 0 108 mol l 1 s 1 in coastal seawater petasne and zika 1987 these concentrations of ros were much higher than those generated in this work the level of ros induced by sunlight depends on the intensity of sunlight but ros are also generated at the bottom of shallow water such as the coastal sea where they participate in denitrification canfield et al 2010 petasne and zika 1987 therefore the inhibition of ros on n2o reduction may be ubiquitous since the effect of ros on n2o reduction has rarely been investigated natural n2o emissions may have been underestimated the results of this study encourage a reexamination of the process of n2o emissions in nature particularly in systems in which ros are present during the denitrification process 4 conclusion in this work the mechanisms of n2o emission during peden process by bio hybrids were revealed the main conclusions are 1 this work demonstrated in addition to free nitrous acid fna reactive oxidative species ros were a unique factor affecting n2o emission during peden the n2o reduction step exhibited great susceptibility to the ros 2 the contributions of h2o2 o2 oh and fna to the inhibition of n2o reduction were 15 0 5 4 1 3 and 70 2 respectively for a reduction of 13 5 mg l no3 n 3 the system was sensitive to the input no3 n and no2 n resulting in changes in the n2o n2 n2o ratio from 1 to 95 4 a significant down regulation

aerosol particles to the air and this process has the potential to spread emerging pollutants into the air where the particles can be widely transported over long distances to areas where this pollution is unexpected this study demonstrates aeration tanks in wwtps as a potential source of ketamine methamphetamine and other emerging contaminant emissions into the air ketamine and methamphetamine are frequently detected in high concentrations maximum of 151 8 162 8 pg m3 in gaseous and aerosol samples along with 24 other emerging contaminants through correlation analysis the common occurrence of emerging contaminants in air is attributable to their high aqueous concentrations as well as their physicochemical properties two simple regression models are developed to provide a practical and convenient way to estimate the steady state concentrations in air the gas phase emission model illustrates the relationship between the solubility the pk a and the aqueous concentration of compounds in the aeration basin and their gaseous concentrations in air statistical strength of 74 1 p value 0 05 while the partition model establishes the ratio of a compound in the gas and particulate phases in air statistical strength of 82 6 p value 0 05 the results provide a basis for assessing the risk of the inhalation exposure to airborne emerging contaminants however in

personal care products ppcps in air a total of 110 commonly found emerging contaminants were surveyed in this study of these compounds 26 were detected in both gas and airborne particulate matter aerosols however the compounds had different distributions in the gas and particulate phases ketamine and methamphetamine were frequently detected with stable values in the gaseous and aerosol samples from the wwtp fig 1 in addition to ketamine and methamphetamine seven other compounds perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos perfluorooctanoate pfoa benzotriazole bt tolyltriazole tt pentoxifylline erythromycin h2o and clarithromycin were dominant in the wwtp atmosphere and all were detected with high frequencies 90 fig 1 shows that the observational data between the samples are reproducible and consistent the average concentrations of nine air samples the gas and particulate phases ranged from 29 2 to 559 4 pg m3 ketamine methamphetamine pfoa bt and tt generally occurred in the gas phase while pfos pentoxifylline erythromycin h2o and clarithromycin generally occurred in the particulate phase these 9 compounds were closely studied and were used to develop prediction models the remaining 17 compounds occurred in lower concentrations average of 0 01 11 48 pg m3 and were distributed in both gaseous and particulate phases fig 2 shows the average load normalized by caeration from the wwtp to the atmosphere with the relative contributions of the gaseous and particulate phases to the total load fig 2a shows the ratio of compounds in the air and water phases 10 6 some compounds primarily reside in the gas phase while others reside on aerosols ketamine and methamphetamine occurred in both gaseous and particulate phases with averages of 80 range 49 6 96 1 and 62 range 32 5 78 4 respectively distributed in the gaseous phase fig 2b shows the partitioning of the compounds between the gaseous and particulate phases bt tt and pfoa mainly occurred in the gaseous phase 90 for bt and tt and 84 for pfoa while 89 of the remaining four compounds pfos pentoxifylline erythromycin h2o and clarithromycin occurred in the particulate phase these results indicate that the partition behavior is heavily compound dependent each compound shows distinct aqueous concentrations and physicochemical properties these factors may lead to their different distributions in air as discussed in section 3 2 3 2 factors influencing the air water partition of emerging contaminants 3 2 1 high concentrations in water the common occurrence of ketamine methamphetamine and other emerging contaminants in air is attributable to their high aqueous concentrations as well as their physicochemical properties correspondingly fig s2 shows that 62 emerging contaminants were detected in water samples from the influent and aeration basin of the dihua wwtp and of these emerging contaminants 19 were detected in air thus over 2 3 of the 26 emerging contaminants observed in the air were found in high concentrations in the wastewater the other 7 compounds were present in only trace amounts in air very close to the detection limits ketamine and methamphetamine were consistently found in all water samples from the wwtp and were both persistently detected in all particulate and gaseous samples fig 1 in the dihua wwtp ketamine and methamphetamine were found with maximum concentrations of 1180 ng l and 6800 ng l respectively in the influent 1605 ng l and 689 ng l respectively in the aeration basin and 76 3 162 8 pg m3 and 102 1 151 8 pg m3 respectively in the air in summary a high concentration in the aqueous environment is a necessary but not sufficient condition for emerging contaminants to be detectable in air 3 2 2 physicochemical properties according to thermodynamics the saturation vapor pressure which is a function of a compound s gibbs free energy plays an important role in the compound s partitioning in air and water ketamine and methamphetamine are classified as volatile and semivolatile compounds respectively bt tt and pfos have even higher vapor pressures than ketamine and methamphetamine however the concentration of a compound in air is not strongly correlated with its saturation vapor pressure table s2 possibly because emerging contaminants can be absorbed by suspended solids in an aqueous environment and then transmitted into the air by the bursting of bubbles in the aeration basin therefore other physicochemical properties such as the molecular weight water solubility log k ow log k oc and pk a were included for analyzing the partition between water and air and between the gaseous and particulate phases in air the physicochemical properties of the target compounds are shown in supporting information table s1 a correlation analysis of the physicochemical properties of the compounds in air and their concentrations clearly showed that the molecular weight water solubility vapor pressure log k ow log k oc and pk a are the key factors determining the distribution of the compounds in air especially in the particulate phase fig 3 and supporting information table s2 as shown in fig 3b the correlations between the normalized air concentrations and the compound characteristics show that the dominant factors for a gaseous distribution are in order aqueous concentration water solubility pk a vapor pressure in contrast the dominant factors for particulate distribution are in order molecular weight vapor pressure log k ow log k oc pk a ionizable groups generally facilitate the transport of compounds into cells and across membranes at physiological ph based on the passive diffusion barrier concept andrasi et al 2007 manallack 2007 however these characteristics could expedite compound transport from water to air in an aeration basin ions have no measurable vapor pressure and do not tend to volatilize if formed in the atmosphere ions partition irreversibly into aerosol particles trapp et al 2010 in addition ionization may decrease sorption to suspended solids and sludge most drugs are weakly acidic or basic and many abused drugs are organic bases for a weak acid or base pk a can be used to determine the degree of ionization as shown by the henderson hasselbalch equation compounds significantly distributed in the gaseous phase such as ketamine methamphetamine bt and tt are all highly water soluble with a pk a comparable to the ph of the aeration tank 6 5 8 5 therefore these compounds are generally present as neutral and nonionized species and are desorbed under the aeration process note that most of the organic compounds detected here have low volatility vapor pressure less than 0 1 mm hg and bubble aeration may dominate over surface aeration in the desorption mechanism however compounds with larger molecular weights and higher log k oc values 2 5 such as macrolide antibiotics erythromycin h2o clarithromycin roxithromycin and azithromycin ofloxacin pfos and pfoa were found in significant amounts in the particulate phase larger and heavier molecules tend to be less water soluble due to the stronger london forces a compound with log k oc 2 5 which is ph dependent can diffuse more rapidly into cells across biomembranes than that with a lower log k oc franco and trapp 2010 trapp et al 2010 in addition as log k ow increases the sorption potential increases resulting in a relative decrease in mobility stevens garmon et al 2011 trapp et al 2008 this result also implies that the compounds shown in the airborne particulate matter may correlate with those that easily adsorb to sludge and soil the analysis provides a general scheme of the transport of organic contaminants across a gas liquid interface 3 3 predictive model because the gaseous concentrations of emerging contaminants in air can be explained by the correlation analysis the factors that dominate the gaseous distribution the aqueous phase concentration the water solubility and pk a were selected to develop a simple empirical model eq 1 for steady state conditions in the model all the parameters were normalized with the corresponding standard deviations and adjusted to be centered at the corresponding average values the values of the average and standard deviation used for normalization are shown in table s3 our results clearly indicate a satisfactory match between the predicted and measured values fig 4 all residuals are within 2 standard deviations of their expected values fig 4a and fig s3 for total ketamine and methamphetamine gaseous concentrations can be predicted well to within 10 furthermore the statistical strength of the model is 74 1 and the p values of the regression model and the regression coefficient are less than 0 05 these results clearly indicate a satisfactory match between the predicted and measured values 1 z conc gas 0 589 0 691 z conc aeration 0 447 z compound ws 0 148 z compound pka z conc gas standardized concentration in the gaseous phase z conc aeration standardized aqueous concentration in the aeration basin z compound ws standardized water solubility z compound pka standardized pk a in contrast as shown previously the molecular weight of a compound is the key parameter affecting the gas aerosol distribution a high molecular weight and a low octanol water partition coefficient log k ow favor adsorption in the solid phase a high carbon adsorption coefficient log k oc also facilitates solid phase adsorption at the solid liquid interface therefore to estimate the airborne particulate concentrations of the studied emerging contaminants emitted from the aeration basin an empirical partition model eq 2 was established based on the characteristics of the compound including its molecular weight vapor pressure log k ow log k oc and pk a the model makes excellent predictions fig 4b for compounds with physicochemical properties in the following ranges water solubility 2800 mg l pk a 7 5 and molecular weight 750 g mol the overall statistical strength is 82 6 and the p values of the regression model and the regression coefficients are 0 05 in addition the u s epa water9 model air emission models for waste and wastewater north carolina usa epa 453 r 94 080a was also tested for the estimation of emission rates emission factors for our cases detailed information is provided in supplementary information text s2 the rationales behind water9 and the empirical model are similar but water9 requires more detailed information about the target contaminants such as diffusion coefficients biodegradation factors and antoine coefficients the general trend of emerging contaminant emission factors predicted by the water9 model is similar to the concentrations experimentally measured and empirically estimated by the model established here however the water9 model does not provide the partition in gaseous or particulate forms in the air in summary the agreement evidenced the reliability and generality of the empirical model established here 2 z particle gas particle 0 809 z compound mw 0 428 z compound vp 0 477 z compound logkow 0 218 z compound logkoc 0 153 z compound pka z particle gas particle

standardized log k oc in view of these findings and considering the cost and difficulty of the chemical analysis of various emerging contaminants in air the simple empirical models established here provide a practical and convenient way to estimate the emissions of emerging contaminants from a wwtp if the physicochemical properties of persistent compounds and their aqueous concentrations are known the corresponding steady state concentrations in air can be reasonably described and predicted by these two models nevertheless in this study the high volume samplers were placed near the aeration tanks and did not directly sample the air from the tank thus the concentration may be further diluted by the natural ventilation air and the steady state concentrations may not be under air water partitioning equilibrium therefore more studies are required to validate the proposed model in other wwtps 3 4 the risk of inhalation exposure to airborne emerging contaminants ketamine and methamphetamine on aerosols and in the gaseous phase have a high potential impact on human health the particulate matter collected by high volume samplers comprises airborne particles with aerodynamic sizes below 2 5 μm as collocated particle size measurements show 81 of the volume concentration of particles smaller than 2 5 μm is made up of submicron particles the other 19 consists of supermicron particles hsiao et al 2019 this proportion suggests that the emerging contaminants in the air of the wwtp might primarily reside on pm1 0 these aerosols can spread remotely in the air and enter human lungs or be deposited in the lung periphery and then transferred to cellular tissues and or the circulatory system valavanidis et al 2008 compared with the corresponding concentrations in wastewater the airborne concentrations are several orders of magnitude lower because of air water partitioning as well as the volume expansion of the chemical carrying medium however if these concentrations are expressed per unit mass of airborne particulate matter then the values may be similar to or even higher than the concentrations in liquid due to the concentrating effect of solvent removal by evaporation in addition the daily intake volume of air is much larger than that of water the potential exposure doses of the considered emerging contaminants through drinking and inhalation were estimated and are listed in table 1 the drinking dosages are still higher than the inhalation dosages but the differences are greatly reduced however humans generally do not drink wastewater but can inhale air emitted by wwtps this study provides a basis for assessing the risk of inhalation exposure to airborne emerging contaminants and other contaminants however in depth research is still required to address the exact impact on human health since the exposed concentration could be further decreased with distance from the emission source 4 conclusions this study first investigated the occurrence of ketamine methamphetamine and other emerging contaminants in air emitted from an urban wwtp the results indicated that contaminants transmitted from water to air may lead to gas particle partitioning of compounds in the air partitioning behavior in the environment is strongly compound dependent and is thought to be related to the physicochemical properties of compounds as demonstrated in the correlation analysis in this work ketamine and methamphetamine occurred in both gaseous and particulate phases bt tt and pfoa mainly occurred in the gaseous phase and pfos pentoxifylline erythromycin h2o and clarithromycin mostly occurred in the particulate phase two regression models were established and they provide a convenient way to estimate the concentration of compounds emitted from water to air and the ratio of a compound in the gas and particulate phases the results here provide a basis for assessing the risk of inhalation exposure to airborne emerging contaminants which

determine the degree of ionization as shown by the henderson hasselbalch equation compounds significantly distributed in the gaseous phase such as ketamine methamphetamine bt and tt are all highly water soluble with a pk a comparable to the ph of the aeration tank 6 5 8 5 therefore these compounds are generally present as neutral and nonionized species and are desorbed under the aeration process note that most of the organic compounds detected here have low volatility vapor pressure less than 0 1 mm hg and bubble aeration may dominate over surface aeration in the desorption mechanism however compounds with larger molecular weights and higher log k oc values 2 5 such as macrolide antibiotics erythromycin h2o clarithromycin roxithromycin and azithromycin ofloxacin pfos and pfoa were found in significant amounts in the particulate phase larger and heavier molecules tend to be less water soluble due to the stronger london forces a compound with log k oc 2 5 which is ph dependent can diffuse more rapidly into cells across biomembranes than that with a lower log k oc franco and trapp 2010 trapp et al 2010 in addition as log k ow increases the sorption potential increases resulting in a relative decrease in mobility stevens garmon et al 2011 trapp et al 2008 this result also implies that the compounds shown in the airborne particulate matter may correlate with those that easily adsorb to sludge and soil the analysis provides a general scheme of the transport of organic contaminants across a gas liquid interface 3 3 predictive model because the gaseous concentrations of emerging contaminants in air can be explained by the correlation analysis the factors that dominate the gaseous distribution the aqueous phase concentration the water solubility and pk a were selected to develop a simple empirical model eq 1 for steady state conditions in the model all the parameters were normalized with the corresponding standard deviations and adjusted to be centered at the corresponding average values the values of the average and standard deviation used for normalization are shown in table s3 our results clearly indicate a satisfactory match between the predicted and measured values fig 4 all residuals are within 2 standard deviations of their expected values fig 4a and fig s3 for total ketamine and methamphetamine gaseous concentrations can be predicted well to within 10 furthermore the statistical strength of the model is 74 1 and the p values of the regression model and the regression coefficient are less than 0 05 these results clearly indicate a satisfactory match between the predicted and measured values 1 z conc gas 0 589 0 691 z conc aeration 0 447 z compound ws 0 148 z compound pka z conc gas standardized concentration in the

molecular weight of a compound is the key parameter affecting the gas aerosol distribution a high molecular weight and a low octanol water partition coefficient log k ow favor adsorption in the solid phase a high carbon adsorption coefficient log k oc also facilitates solid phase adsorption at the solid liquid interface therefore to estimate the airborne particulate concentrations of the studied emerging contaminants emitted from the aeration basin an empirical partition model eq 2 was established based on the characteristics of the compound including its molecular weight vapor pressure log k ow log k oc and pk a the model makes excellent predictions fig 4b for compounds with physicochemical properties in the following ranges water solubility 2800 mg l pk a 7 5 and molecular weight 750 g

wastewater north carolina usa epa 453 r 94 080a was also tested for the estimation of emission rates emission factors for our cases detailed information is provided in supplementary information text s2 the rationales behind water9 and the empirical model are similar but water9 requires more detailed information about the target contaminants such as diffusion coefficients biodegradation factors and antoine coefficients the general trend of emerging contaminant emission factors predicted by the water9 model is similar to the concentrations experimentally measured and empirically estimated by the model established here however the water9 model does not provide the partition in gaseous or particulate forms in the air in summary the agreement evidenced the reliability and generality of the empirical model established here 2 z particle gas particle 0 809 z compound mw 0 428 z compound vp 0 477 z compound logkow 0 218 z compound logkoc 0 153 z compound pka z particle gas particle

standardized log k oc in view of these findings and considering the cost and difficulty of the chemical analysis of various emerging contaminants in air the simple empirical models established here provide a practical and convenient way to estimate the emissions of emerging contaminants from a wwtp if the physicochemical properties of persistent compounds and their aqueous concentrations are known the corresponding steady state concentrations in air can be reasonably described and predicted by these two models nevertheless in this study the high volume samplers were placed near the aeration tanks and did not directly sample the air from the tank thus the concentration may be further diluted by the natural ventilation air and the steady state concentrations may not be under air water partitioning equilibrium therefore more studies are required to validate the proposed model in other wwtps 3 4 the risk of inhalation exposure to airborne emerging contaminants ketamine and methamphetamine on aerosols and in the gaseous phase have a high potential impact on human health the particulate matter collected by high volume samplers comprises airborne particles with aerodynamic sizes below 2 5 μm as collocated particle size measurements show 81 of the volume concentration of particles smaller than 2 5 μm is made up of submicron particles the other 19 consists of supermicron particles hsiao et al 2019 this proportion suggests that the emerging contaminants in the air of the wwtp might primarily reside on pm1 0 these aerosols can spread remotely in the air and enter human lungs or be deposited in the lung periphery and then transferred to cellular tissues and or the circulatory system valavanidis et al 2008 compared with the corresponding concentrations in wastewater the airborne concentrations are several orders of magnitude lower because of air water partitioning as well as the volume expansion of the chemical carrying medium however if these concentrations are expressed per unit mass of airborne particulate matter then the values may be similar to or even higher than the concentrations in liquid due to the concentrating effect of solvent removal by evaporation in addition the daily intake volume of air is much larger than that of water the potential exposure doses of the considered emerging contaminants through drinking and inhalation were estimated and are listed in table 1 the drinking dosages are still higher than the inhalation dosages but the differences are greatly reduced however humans generally do not drink wastewater but can inhale air emitted by wwtps this study provides a basis for assessing the risk of inhalation exposure to airborne emerging contaminants and other contaminants however in depth research is still required to address the exact impact on human health since the exposed concentration could be further decreased with distance from the emission source 4 conclusions this study first investigated the occurrence of ketamine methamphetamine and other emerging contaminants in air emitted from an urban wwtp the results indicated that contaminants transmitted from water to air may lead to gas particle partitioning of compounds in the air partitioning behavior in the environment is strongly compound dependent and is thought to be related to the physicochemical properties of compounds as demonstrated in the correlation analysis in this work ketamine and methamphetamine occurred in both gaseous and particulate phases bt tt and pfoa mainly occurred in the gaseous phase and pfos pentoxifylline erythromycin h2o and clarithromycin mostly occurred in the particulate phase two regression models were established and they provide a convenient way to estimate the concentration of compounds emitted from water to air and the ratio of a compound in the gas and particulate phases the results here provide a basis for assessing the risk of inhalation exposure to airborne emerging contaminants which

18139,microbial degradation is an elimination method for removal of organic contaminants from soil and water however the main factor limiting its practical application is high bacterial sensitivity to environmental factors such as ph toxicity and mass transfer in this study biochar was produced pyrolytically from peanut shells at 350 c 550 c and 750 c referred to as bc350 bc550 and bc750 respectively and their promotion on phenol biodegradation in wastewater by the bacterium pseudomonas citronellolis was investigated higher initial phenol concentration 400 mg l 1 showed obvious inhibition on biodegradation with the removal efficiencies being less than 46 and even the bacterium failed to survive at the phenol concentrations of higher than 1000 mg l 1 with biochar incorporated the removal efficiencies of phenol increased from below 46 to up to 99 at the initial concentrations of 400 1200 mg l 1 immobilization of strains in biochar by calcium alginate further increased the microbial tolerance to high concentrations of phenol i e 63 removal at 1200 mg l 1 scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that biochar acted as shelter to support the bacterium to struggle with extreme conditions the initial adsorption of phenol by biochar alleviated the initial toxicity of phenol to bacterium and the subsequent gradual desorption controlled the bioavailability of phenol in this regard bc350 showed a comparable sorption capacity with bc550 and bc750 while a higher desorption potential than them thus balanced better the toxicity and bioavailability of phenol to microbes alkalinity of bc550 and bc750 played important roles in rescuing the microbes from being damaged by ph shock via neutralizing the fast generation of acidic intermediates the extractable organic substances in bc350 could be consumed by bacterium as substrates which was confirmed by incubating the strains in water extractable solution results of this study indicate that incorporation of microbes with biochar could promote the biodegradation of high concentration organic wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords biochar phenol biodegradation adsorption desorption alkalinity soluble organic matter 1 introduction bioremediation has been proved to be a promising and environmentally friendly treatment method of organic contaminants in soil and water ortega calvo et al 2015 mikkonen et al 2018 however application of bioremediation to the contaminated filed is largely limited due to the fact that microbes usually show unsatisfactory survivability and activity when facing loading shock and highly heterogenic environmental media biswas et al 2015 biochar pyrolyzed from waste biomass in an oxygen limited atmosphere is characterized by a poly condensed carbonaceous structure diverse surficial oxygen containing functional groups relatively abundant micropores and alkalinity xiao et al 2018 wei et al 2019 tao et al 2019 in addition to carbon sequestration and soil fertility improvement biochar also exhibited high potential in the elimination of organic contaminants via physical i e adsorption and or microbial i e acting as an additive to enhance microbial degradation reactions tong et al 2014 xiong et al 2017 khan et al 2019 phenol contaminated wastewater is a typical high toxicity industrial wastewater with a wide range of concentrations from 20 to 1200 mg l 1 kurzbaum et al 2017 phenolic compounds would inhibit or damage the bacterial species thus application of biological methods to treat this pollutant is particularly difficult chen et al 2019 a recent study investigated the effects of biochar addition on phenol 400 700 mg l 1 removal in a sequencing batch reactor and found that abundances of comamonas and cupriavidus increased significantly after biochar exposure whereas treatment with relatively high biochar dosage conversely inhibited thauera shi et al 2019 another relevant research was about biodegradation of phenol 100 2000 mg l 1 by immobilization of microbes with activated carbon and clay massalha et al 2010 although the promotion effect was observed by the two materials the biodegradation rate decreased significantly in the high phenol concentration 260 mg l 1 as compared to the low concentration 200 260 mg l 1 moreover this study focused on the process modeling and the mechanisms exploration was limited biochar was found to promote the removal of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs by pseudomonas putida and researchers proposed that biochar could pre concentrate pahs and consequently shorten the contact distance between the pollutants and the microbes chen et al 2012 or induce an enrichment of pah degraders kong et al 2018 similarly with biochar addition sphingomonas sp dz3 exhibited a high efficiency of 93 for 4 monobrominated diphenyl ether bde 3 degradation as compared with 10 removal efficiency in the strain free control which was ascribed to the biochar induced elevation of the microorganism s tolerance against high concentrations of bde 3 du et al 2016 some studies showed that both biochar and activated carbon can promote the reductive debromination of tetrabromobisphenol a but with different responses for microbial taxa lefèvre et al 2018 biochar had also been found to facilitate direct interspecies electron transfer in co cultures between different species sun et al 2017 lü et al 2018 while other studies did not find this facilitating effect on the co culture metabolism of geobacter metallireducens and sulfurreducens zhang et al 2018b despite the obvious promotion effects of biochar to microbes its potential adverse effects on removal of organic contaminants should not be overlook biochar s strong affinity for the organic contaminants may greatly suppress their bioavailability to microbes li et al 2018 sigmund et al 2018 for example xin and co authors observed a 90 reduction of degradation efficiency for 2 2 4 4 tetrabromodiphenyl ether with biochar addition and speculated that the slow desorption of this substance from biochar might be the rate limiting step responsible for the degradation decrease xin et al 2014 the most relevant literatures on biochar induced promotion of biodegradation were summarized in table s1 and it was found that there were fairly limited studies in phenol degradation especially at the relatively high concentration of phenol besides systematic studies of how the complex characteristics of biochar impact on the biodegradation of organic contaminants especially along the dynamic biodegradation process are still lacking in this study multiple dimensions of biochar promoting degradation of high concentrations of phenol were conducted and mechanisms were explored systematically via a series of well designed experiments such as adsorption desorption dynamics ph buffering effects on microbial growth and water extraction of biochar s soluble organic substances as substrates of the bacterium moreover we demonstrated how these processes functioned sequentially at different stages of phenol degradation and varied with biochars produced by different pyrolysis temperatures 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation and characterization of biochar peanut shell arachis hypogaea l a common crop residue was chosen for biochar preparation because of its crosslinked fiber structure zhao et al 2014 the biochar production was performed in a n2 atmosphere in a tubular furnace with the heating program set to maintain 100 c for 1 h followed by 10 c min 1 elevation to 350 c 550 c or 750 c these chars are designated as bc350 bc550 and bc750 respectively the details of the biochar production could be found in our previous work zhao et al 2018 the final temperature was held for 2 h and subsequently the harvested biochar was milled to pass through a 200 mesh sieve for comparison a commercially available activated carbon ac with similar particle size was purchased from nanjing chemical reagent co ltd china detailed information for biomass pretreatment biochar production and biochar characterization are presented in the supporting information section s1 and s2 biochar properties are shown in table 1 2 2 preparation of phenol degrading bacterium the phenol degrading bacterium pseudomonas citronellolis was purchased from china agricultural microbial species conservation and management center strain no accc 02839 the bacterium is gram negative and aerobic and it can use phenol as the sole carbon and energy source the detailed culture method for this strain is presented in section s3 to verify the biochar s role as a supporter or shelter of microbes the strains were immobilized in biochar with calcium alginate to form small black pellets and their capacity to degrade phenol was tested in aqueous solution with high phenol concentrations of 600 800 1 000 and 1200 mg l 1 detailed steps can be seen in section s3 2 3 phenol removal experiments biodegradation of phenol with different initial concentrations from 100 to 1200 mg l 1 was performed with 4 w v pseudomonas citronellolis inoculation in the presence or absence of biochar and the mixtures were incubated at 30 c and 160 rpm samples were taken to determine the phenol concentration with high performance liquid chromatography breeze hplc waters corp usa detailed steps for preparation of phenol solution and measurement conditions can be seen in section s4 the adsorption desorption experiments and kinetics fitting were conducted to investigate how biochar could storage and release phenol therefore influences the equilibrium between toxicity and bioavailability of phenol to bacteria the lagergren first order kinetics pseudo second order kinetics and molecular diffusion model were used to fit the phenol adsorption and desorption kinetics detailed information on the experimental methods and kinetics fitting can be seen in section s5 2 4 distinguishing adsorbed phenol from degraded phenol in order to distinguish the adsorbed phenol from the degraded phenol the residual phenol in the aqueous phase and the extracted phenol from the solid phase biochar should be measured several extracts were tested including ethanol alcohol tetrachloromethane and acetonitrile to select a highly efficient extraction agent and finally the acetonitrile water system high polarity logkow 1 46 high solubility in water 80 g l 1 was chosen because a satisfactory phenol recovery can be obtained fig s1 the recovery efficiency of phenol from bc350 separated from the system with a phenol concentration of 30 600 mg l 1 was 100 for bc550 and bc750 the recovery efficiencies of phenol were 88 1 100 and 67 2 84 9 respectively fig s1 in contrast phenol was easily to be detached from ac even more than 100 desorption was detected at a low concentration of 100 mg l 1 fig s1 this was due to the activated carbon itself contained a small amount of phenol which was detected in the blank ac extraction a linear relationship was found between the recovery efficiency and the initial phenol concentration r2 0 970 and the slope was not high fig s1 which is the basis for calculating the total residual phenol in the degradation system 2 5 identifying biochar s alkalinity in relieving acid inhibition on bacterium effects of ph on the growth of microbes were firstly tested in different initial phs 3 72 6 54 7 10 and 7 60 and the increase of optical density at 600 nm od600 was measured to verify the contribution of minerals to alkalinity of biochar another biochar was specially prepared by hcl rinsing nan et al 2019 and referred to as demineralized biochar dm bc550 briefly 5 g bc550 was suspended in 50 ml 2 m hcl in an erlenmeyer flask and horizontally shaken for 4 h at 30 c and 160 rpm biochar was filtered using a 0 45 μm filter and rinsed with deionized water until the ph of the filtrate remained constant the harvested dm bc550 was used as a comparison with bc550 to explore how minerals in biochar buffer the ph and influence the microbial growth samples were taken at 4 h and 40 h for the measurement of phenol and ph and concentration of ca ii and mg ii was detected with an inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer 5110 icp oes agilent technologies inc usa 2 6 verifying soluble organic substances in biochar as substrates the soluble organic substances were extracted from the biochars and used to cultivate the strains bc350 bc550 and bc750 were added to the inorganic medium section s3 at a ratio of 0 6 w v and then oscillated at 30 c and 160 rpm for 8 h after filtering through a 0 45 μm filter membrane and sterilization the aqueous extracts were labeled as water bc350 water bc550 and water bc750 these extracts were used to prepare phenol solution of 600 mg l 1 and inoculated with 4 the strains samples of 0 5 ml were taken at regular intervals to monitor the phenol concentration and ph value in the liquid phase other 1 6 ml samples were used to detect the species and relative concentration of organics by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms 7890b pegasus bt agilent technologies inc usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 significant promotion of biodegradation of phenol by biochar the removal dynamics of phenol at initial concentrations from 100 mg l 1 to 1200 mg l 1 by pseudomonas citronellolis are presented in fig 1 satisfactory removal could only be obtained in low phenol concentrations of 100 and 200 mg l 1 at which the removal efficiencies were 100 and 80 while the values were only 20 40 at the relatively high phenol concentrations of 400 and 800 mg l 1 and the bacterium even failed to survive at the high concentrations of 1000 and 1200 mg l 1 the starting time of phenol degradation was also greatly delayed at high concentrations fig 1 the growth of strains in different initial phenol concentrations was tested as shown in fig s2 the low phenol concentration of 100 mg l 1 allowed the strains to grow the fastest while the final bacterial concentration od600 value of 0 06 was significantly lower than that of the system with phenol concentrations of 200 mg l 1 and 400 mg l 1 od600 value of 0 12 the observation indicated that low phenol concentration could not provide enough carbon source which was rapidly consumed by the strains in contrast the relatively high phenol concentration of 400 mg l 1 exhibited an obviously toxic inhibitory effect on microbial growth and the final concentration of the bacterium did not exceed those in the system with 200 mg l 1 phenol can be considered as a toxic substance at high concentrations and as a carbon source for microbes at low concentrations growth of bacterium in all systems presented a strong correlation with reduced phenol concentration fig s2 this proved that although high concentrations of phenol provided sufficient metabolic substrates the toxicity eventually inhibited the metabolism of phenol by microbes with the incorporation of biochar with the bacterium removal of phenol in all conditions was promoted significantly fig 2 firstly effects of biochar addition into the systems were compared among biochars produced at different temperatures fig 2a a relative long stagnation was observed compared with all the following experiments because this was the first batch of the experiments and the strains were still in the adaptive stage of phenol even so all biochar showed a rapid decrease of phenol at the beginning due to the adsorption by biochar the highest strengthening effect was obtained by bc550 dose and it greatly accelerated the biodegradation and made a sudden reduction of phenol at about 20 h compared with the control without biochar addition fig 2a bc350 also achieved a high final removal rate with a 10 h lag phase compared to the bc550 however in the bc750 system bacterium could not survive successfully and only adsorbed about 25 of phenol this was probably because of the high alkalinity ph 11 2 of bc750 table 1 resulting in the failure of tolerance of strains to the high concentration of phenol 800 mg l 1 the specific surface areas of bc350 bc550 and bc750 were 11 143 and 304 m2 g 1 respectively table 2 which did not present obvious correlation with the adsorption amount some other mechanisms may be responsible for the phenol adsorption to biochar chen et al 2008 effects of different biochar dose ratios 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 w v and different pyrolytic temperatures 350 c 550 c and 750 c on phenol degradation were also investigated compared with fig 2a adaptive strains were used in all the following experiments results showed that high dose ratio of biochar could increase the initial reduction of phenol concentration via adsorption while the final degradation efficiency might depend on whether the microbes can survive fig 2b for phenol concentrations of 600 800 1 000 and 1200 mg l 1 2 w v biochar addition resulted in final phenol removal of 46 9 36 9 35 1 and 33 7 respectively fig 2c being much higher than 29 6 24 5 0 and 0 without biochar addition fig 1 to further improve the phenol removal at higher concentrations the strains were immobilized in biochar with calcium alginate an interesting result was that much higher degradation efficiencies were achieved 98 9 90 5 69 6 and 62 5 respectively even for the highest initial phenol concentration of 1200 mg l 1 fig 2d while the samples without biochar failed to degrade phenol fig s3 it was guessed that higher biochar addition would be more effective in facilitating the microbes to survive to achieve a high biodegradation efficiency 3 2 biochar as shelter for microbes to protect them against adverse environment biochar is a porous material with an inhomogeneous and coarse pore structure yang et al 2016 most biochars are mesoporous with pore sizes of 2 30 nm and total pore volumes in the range 0 01 0 3 cm3 g 1 zhao et al 2014 in this study the total pore volumes of bc350 bc550 and bc750 were 0 089 0 131 and 0 174 cm3 g 1 respectively table 2 the specific surface area of biochar was about 10 300 m2 g 1 which was much lower than that of ac 800 1200 m2 g 1 such a matrix was assumed to act as a shelter or supporter for microbes fig 3 is the surface morphology of bacteria attached to biochar probed by scanning electron microscope the images clearly show that due partly to the electrostatic adsorption the bacterium could go either into the biochar pores or attach to the biochar surface this relatively loose fixation of microbes by biochar seemed to facilitate microbial growth and promote reproduction to investigate whether the fixation of bacterium could help them resist highly toxic contaminants they were immobilized in biochar with calcium alginate gel the black pellets were used to degrade phenol at high concentrations 600 1200 mg l 1 and the results were compared with those pellets that immobilized strains only by calcium alginate gel without biochar as supporter fig s3 the photographs can be seen in fig s4 the black pellets with biochar in them showed an obvious stronger tolerance to high concentrations of phenol and obtained a 100 degradation rate in the 600 mg l 1 phenol wastewater which was much higher than that without biochar specially the pellets that formed only with calcium alginate immobilization in the absence of biochar also showed about 40 80 degradation in the initial phenol concentrations of 600 1000 mg l 1 while a failure of survive was observed in concentration of 1200 mg l 1 fig s3 even being lower than only biochar addition 30 0 fig 2c in addition bacterium began to degrade phenol more quickly in biochar system than only by calcium alginate immobilization results indicated that biochar could act as a supporter sheltering the microbes against the adverse environment 3 3 adsorption desorption of phenol by biochar related to biodegradation the adsorption capacity of bc350 bc550 and bc750 for phenol was tested in the absence of microbes with ac used as a contrast bc350 bc550 and bc750 exhibited a comparable adsorption capacity 28 2 28 9 and 32 2 mg g 1 respectively which were much lower than that of ac 85 1 mg g 1 table s2 moreover the adsorption process of the biochar was relatively slow and lasted for more than 12 h but that of ac was very fast and took only 5 min to reach equilibrium fig 4 a the adsorption process of biochar was more fitting with pseudo second order kinetics r2 0 999 which was consistent with previous studies qian et al 2009 ngigi et al 2019 in addition the adsorption kinetic coefficients k2 and initial adsorption rate u of the biochars could be ranked as follows bc350 bc750 bc550 fig 4a table s2 the adsorption thermodynamics experiments showed that phenol adsorption by bc350 and ac were more consistent with the freundlich isothermal adsorption model r2 0 999 and 0 996 respectively while that of bc750 fitted well with the langmuir isothermal adsorption model r2 0 997 and those of bc550 were very close to each other r2 0 996 and 0 995 table s3 xiao and pignatello 2016 liang et al 2019 desorption of phenol from biochar fitted pseudo second order kinetics r2 0 999 fig 4b the final desorption percentages were 60 6 19 9 11 7 and 23 8 for bc350 bc550 bc750 and ac respectively table s4 most of the phenol adsorbed in bc350 was easily desorbed while minor of the phenol adsorbed in bc550 and bc750 could be desorbed indicating a lower binding energy state between phenol and bc350 there were abundant functional groups in bc350 thus the adsorption of phenol by bc350 was mainly via the partition of aliphatic carbon and the complex structure of the electron donor acceptor formed by the surface electron donor groups and phenol molecules saquing et al 2016 zhang et al 2018c in contrast bc550 and bc750 contained less surface functional groups whereas their micropore surface area 341 and 457 m2 g 1 and micropore volume 0 131 and 0 174 cm3 g 1 were much higher than bc350 222 m2 g 1 and 0 089 cm3 g 1 table 2 hadi et al demonstrated the significance of micropore surface area rather than total surface area in the adsorption of phenol charcoal materials with higher fraction of micropores will uptake higher phenol which could be attributed to the π π london dispersion forces between the graphitic carbon basal planes and the phenol aromatic ring hadi et al 2015 ghafari et al 2019 this high binding force would resist the detachment of phenol which is disadvantageous to its degradation fu et al 2018 luo et al 2019 the phenol had been adsorbed by biochar must has a tendency to be desorbed when biodegradation induced a sharp decrease of phenol concentration in liquid phase with a re distribution of phenol in solid liquid phases thus affecting their further biodegradation due to the micropore diameter of biochar was less than 2 nm not only the bacteria pseudomonas citronellolis with cell size between 1 5 2 μm 0 6 0 8 μm cannot directly contact the phenol in the adsorbed state but also extracellular enzymes with diameters of 1 100 nm cannot reach the adsorbed phenol fuchs et al 1988 even for the microbes inhabiting in the biochar pores metabolization of the phenol in the solid phase would consume too much of their energy esfanjani et al 2018 therefore if the phenol desorption speed is lower than its consumption speed desorption would become the limiting step of phenol degradation fig 5 shows the distribution of phenol in the liquid phase and in biochar during degradation clearly the phenol in bc350 decreased significantly with a sharp reduction of phenol in aqueous solution finally the phenol in both aqueous solution and solid were completely degraded at about 20 h and 30 h fig 5a d however there was still a high fraction of phenol retained in bc550 and bc750 matrix until 50 h even when all the phenol in the aqueous solution had been consumed this might indicate that desorption limited the microbial degradation fig 5b and c and this fraction of unavailable phenol for bacterium was possibly present in micropores of biochar formed at higher temperature therefore a moderate capacity of biochar for adsorbing and desorbing phenol was preferred to maintain an equilibrium between phenol s roles as a carbon source and a toxin 3 4 key role of biochar s alkalinity in relieving acid inhibition on bacterium one of the main factors influencing microbial growth and enzyme activity is ph fidel et al 2017 in this study response of pseudomonas citronellolis toward various initial ph values 3 70 7 60 was investigated obviously pseudomonas sp was more adaptable to higher ph 6 50 7 60 and neither dissipation of phenol nor bacterial growth occurred when ph was 3 72 fig s5 even at a slightly acidic ph of 6 54 the growth of the strain was significantly inhibited compared with its growth at ph 7 1 accordingly the final removal efficiency of phenol was sharply reduced by 17 1 in contrast when ph increased to 7 6 a significant promotion of microbial growth was obtained the increasing of ph by only 0 5 units promoted bacterial growth by 46 2 and phenol degradation by 15 4 figs s5a and b and the linear relationship in figs s5c and d shows that pseudomonas sp was highly sensitive to ph metabolism of phenol by pseudomonas sp is driven by a series of enzyme catalyzed bioreactions as shown in fig s6 for the ortho cleavage pathway in pseudomonas citronellolis used in this study phenol is firstly transformed to catechol by hydroxylase and later to a sequence of low weight carboxylic acids including cis cis muconic acid and β ketoadipate santos et al 2007 finally phenol and all intermediate products could be completely degraded after the tricarboxylic acid cycle in this study the fast reduction of ph accompanied by the sudden decrease of phenol concentration indicated that formation of catechol happened rapidly whereas the subsequent steps were relatively slow in consuming the acids the large amounts of acidic intermediates accumulated and would damage the microbes if nothing was done in this case the alkalinity of biochar began to neutralize acids and played a key role in facilitating the microbes to survive it has been proved that alkalinity of biochar is largely derived from carbonate and the deprotonated surficial oxygen containing functional groups developed during pyrolysis yuan et al 2011 to elucidate the source of the alkalinity a biochar with minerals removed was prepared which is referred to as dm bc550 as expected dm bc550 almost has no ph buffering capacity thus ph of the system decreased to 3 5 3 7 after 16 h being similar to that of the control which resulted in a poor phenol degradation fig 6 a and b the concentration of ca and mg in the liquid phase before and after the biodegradation was measured fig 6c and d at the beginning addition of bc550 increased ca and mg concentration to about 15 mg l 1 and 7 0 mg l 1 respectively indicating that biochar contained a large amount of soluble ca and mg when phenol degradation was carried out for 40 h the ca2 almost doubled in the system with bc550 however this large release of ca2 was not observed in the control dm bc550 and ac systems compared with ca2 the release amount of mg2 could be neglected zhao et al 2018 these results proved that slow dissolution of ca minerals enabled microbes to resist the inhibition caused by the accumulation of acidic intermediates and significantly improved the final phenol degradation efficiency x ray diffraction analysis of bc550 and dm bc550 indicated the presence of caco3 in bc550 but not in dm bc550 fig s7 in addition by comparing their fourier transform infrared spectra fig s8 no obvious differences can be observed for their alkaline functional groups thus minerals were the most contribution to the significant alkalinity of biochar biochar s ph buffering capacity increased with elevated pyrolysis temperature fig s9 bc350 also had enough buffering capacity though its ph was lower 7 16 than bc550 10 5 and bc750 11 2 table 1 and when large acids were generated during biodegradation of phenol bc350 also could increase the ph to a level that enabled microbe s survival the x ray diffraction spectrum showed that at higher pyrolysis temperature calcium oxalate cac2o4 in bc350 was transformed to caco3 in bc550 and further converted to cao in bc750 wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2018a in fig 6b the final ph in ac system was about 5 0 although it was acidic it is not to such an extent as to damage the bacterium compared with bc550 ac had a much lower ph buffering capacity while this was still higher than dm bc and the control with no carbon materials therefore the stagnate stage was very long in the ac system when the bacterium adapted to this environment and survived it could degrade phenol sharply and decreased ph suddenly 25 30 h after that a rebound of ph was observed in ac system which might be induced by the adsorption of small molecule acids to ac these results clearly showed that the final degradation efficiency depended on whether microbes can survive which corelated to the ph buffering ability of an added material 3 5 biochar s soluble organic substances as substrates for bacteria water soluble compounds in fresh biochar was reported to promote or restrict cell growth and such effect is also strain dependent liu et al 2019 yang et al 2019 extracts from the three biochars water bc350 water bc550 and water bc750 plus extract from ac were used as substrate solution to cultivate the bacterium and degrade the phenol as seen in fig 7 a the stagnation of bacterium was water bc750 water bc550 ac water bc350 in all systems ph decreased significantly with the rapid degradation of phenol and remained approximately at 4 0 which was similar to the results for free microbes fig 7b it was obvious that these extracts almost had not ph buffering capacity therefore bacterium stopped work after about 50 70 and 80 of final phenol degradation in the systems of control water bc550 and water bc750 respectively however in the water bc350 system bacterium survived and degraded the phenol again after a temporary stagnation this was because the amounts of extracted compounds were significantly higher in water bc350 than in the other systems table 3 which can also be seen clearly from the brown color in fig s10 graber et al 2014 smith et al 2016 ghidotti et al 2017 similar phenomenon to water bc350 was observed in water ac system due to the relative higher extracted compounds concentration the relative abundances of all organic compounds detected by gc ms at representative sampling times during degradation were listed in table s5 the components were very complex including mainly chain alkane carboxylic acids hydroxyl carboxylic acids phenolic carboxylic acids etc some of them were of high concentration at the beginning and decreased significantly along the biodegradation indicating that these compounds were derived from the extracted substances of the biochars these substances were presented in table 3 some of the other substances only appeared after biodegradation which were assumed to be the intermediates of phenol degradation such as catechol cis cis muconic acid and β ketoadipate fig s11 this relative change of the organic compounds was sufficient to show that biochar dissolution promoted the growth and degradation activity of microbes compared with the blank control in addition the reduction of various monocyclic aromatic compounds such as 3 4 dihydroxybenzoic acid salicylaldehyde and 2 methylbenzoic acid was observed at the initial stage of phenol degradation table 3 phenol has been reported widely as a growth substrate that can co metabolism with many other more refractory compounds and enhance their degradation shi et al 2015 phenol hydroxylase is known to involve in the first step of phenol degradation which belongs to bacterial monooxygenases tran et al 2013 these monocyclic aromatic compounds provided an abundance of carbon and energy sources to improve the phenol hydroxylase activity xiao et al 2019a 2019b as williams and sayers 1994 reported these compounds were first inserted into hydroxyl groups by single or double oxygenase then oxygen atoms were added to open the loop and finally they were broken into small aliphatic compounds to enter the core metabolic cycle of microbes 4 conclusions biochar exhibited significant promotion to the biodegradation of phenol especially at concentrations of above 400 mg l 1 and immobilizing the bacterium in biochar with calcium alginate further strengthened their tolerance to high concentration of phenol as 1200 mg l 1 bacterium enhanced the phenol biodegradation via multi pathways depending on stages and pyrolysis temperatures biochar adsorbed phenol at the initial stage of the reaction and alleviated its toxicity to bacterium the pore structure of biochar enabled bacterium to inhabit in it against the adverse environment at the logarithmic degradation period fast generation and accumulation of acidic intermediates posed damage to bacterium while they could be rescued by biochar as an alkaline source the subsequent gradual desorption of phenol from biochar could facilitate the bacterium to acquire phenol in this regard bc350 showed a comparable sorption capacity with bc550 and bc750 while a higher desorption potential than them thus balanced better the toxicity and bioavailability of phenol to bacterium at last soluble small organic molecules from biochar promoted the growth of bacterium as substrates and accelerated phenol degradation this study provides an environmentally friendly and cost effective technology for promoting biodegradation to practical application

18139,microbial degradation is an elimination method for removal of organic contaminants from soil and water however the main factor limiting its practical application is high bacterial sensitivity to environmental factors such as ph toxicity and mass transfer in this study biochar was produced pyrolytically from peanut shells at 350 c 550 c and 750 c referred to as bc350 bc550 and bc750 respectively and their promotion on phenol biodegradation in wastewater by the bacterium pseudomonas citronellolis was investigated higher initial phenol concentration 400 mg l 1 showed obvious inhibition on biodegradation with the removal efficiencies being less than 46 and even the bacterium failed to survive at the phenol concentrations of higher than 1000 mg l 1 with biochar incorporated the removal efficiencies of phenol increased from below 46 to up to 99 at the initial concentrations of 400 1200 mg l 1 immobilization of strains in biochar by calcium alginate further increased the microbial tolerance to high concentrations of phenol i e 63 removal at 1200 mg l 1 scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that biochar acted as shelter to support the bacterium to struggle with extreme conditions the initial adsorption of phenol by biochar alleviated the initial toxicity of phenol to bacterium and the subsequent gradual desorption controlled the bioavailability of phenol in this regard bc350 showed a comparable sorption capacity with bc550 and bc750 while a higher desorption potential than them thus balanced better the toxicity and bioavailability of phenol to microbes alkalinity of bc550 and bc750 played important roles in rescuing the microbes from being damaged by ph shock via neutralizing the fast generation of acidic intermediates the extractable organic substances in bc350 could be consumed by bacterium as substrates which was confirmed by incubating the strains in water extractable solution results of this study indicate that incorporation of microbes with biochar could promote the biodegradation of high concentration organic wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords biochar phenol biodegradation adsorption desorption alkalinity soluble organic matter 1 introduction bioremediation has been proved to be a promising and environmentally friendly treatment method of organic contaminants in soil and water ortega calvo et al 2015 mikkonen et al 2018 however application of bioremediation to the contaminated filed is largely limited due to the fact that microbes usually show unsatisfactory survivability and activity when facing loading shock and highly heterogenic environmental media biswas et al 2015 biochar pyrolyzed from waste biomass in an oxygen limited atmosphere is characterized by a poly condensed carbonaceous structure diverse surficial oxygen containing functional groups relatively abundant micropores and alkalinity xiao et al 2018 wei et al 2019 tao et al 2019 in addition to carbon sequestration and soil fertility improvement biochar also exhibited high potential in the elimination of organic contaminants via physical i e adsorption and or microbial i e acting as an additive to enhance microbial degradation reactions tong et al 2014 xiong et al 2017 khan et al 2019 phenol contaminated wastewater is a typical high toxicity industrial wastewater with a wide range of concentrations from 20 to 1200 mg l 1 kurzbaum et al 2017 phenolic compounds would inhibit or damage the bacterial species thus application of biological methods to treat this pollutant is particularly difficult chen et al 2019 a recent study investigated the effects of biochar addition on phenol 400 700 mg l 1 removal in a sequencing batch reactor and found that abundances of comamonas and cupriavidus increased significantly after biochar exposure whereas treatment with relatively high biochar dosage conversely inhibited thauera shi et al 2019 another relevant research was about biodegradation of phenol 100 2000 mg l 1 by immobilization of microbes with activated carbon and clay massalha et al 2010 although the promotion effect was observed by the two materials the biodegradation rate decreased significantly in the high phenol concentration 260 mg l 1 as compared to the low concentration 200 260 mg l 1 moreover this study focused on the process modeling and the mechanisms exploration was limited biochar was found to promote the removal of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs by pseudomonas putida and researchers proposed that biochar could pre concentrate pahs and consequently shorten the contact distance between the pollutants and the microbes chen et al 2012 or induce an enrichment of pah degraders kong et al 2018 similarly with biochar addition sphingomonas sp dz3 exhibited a high efficiency of 93 for 4 monobrominated diphenyl ether bde 3 degradation as compared with 10 removal efficiency in the strain free control which was ascribed to the biochar induced elevation of the microorganism s tolerance against high concentrations of bde 3 du et al 2016 some studies showed that both biochar and activated carbon can promote the reductive debromination of tetrabromobisphenol a but with different responses for microbial taxa lefèvre et al 2018 biochar had also been found to facilitate direct interspecies electron transfer in co cultures between different species sun et al 2017 lü et al 2018 while other studies did not find this facilitating effect on the co culture metabolism of geobacter metallireducens and sulfurreducens zhang et al 2018b despite the obvious promotion effects of biochar to microbes its potential adverse effects on removal of organic contaminants should not be overlook biochar s strong affinity for the organic contaminants may greatly suppress their bioavailability to microbes li et al 2018 sigmund et al 2018 for example xin and co authors observed a 90 reduction of degradation efficiency for 2 2 4 4 tetrabromodiphenyl ether with biochar addition and speculated that the slow desorption of this substance from biochar might be the rate limiting step responsible for the degradation decrease xin et al 2014 the most relevant literatures on biochar induced promotion of biodegradation were summarized in table s1 and it was found that there were fairly limited studies in phenol degradation especially at the relatively high concentration of phenol besides systematic studies of how the complex characteristics of biochar impact on the biodegradation of organic contaminants especially along the dynamic biodegradation process are still lacking in this study multiple dimensions of biochar promoting degradation of high concentrations of phenol were conducted and mechanisms were explored systematically via a series of well designed experiments such as adsorption desorption dynamics ph buffering effects on microbial growth and water extraction of biochar s soluble organic substances as substrates of the bacterium moreover we demonstrated how these processes functioned sequentially at different stages of phenol degradation and varied with biochars produced by different pyrolysis temperatures 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation and characterization of biochar peanut shell arachis hypogaea l a common crop residue was chosen for biochar preparation because of its crosslinked fiber structure zhao et al 2014 the biochar production was performed in a n2 atmosphere in a tubular furnace with the heating program set to maintain 100 c for 1 h followed by 10 c min 1 elevation to 350 c 550 c or 750 c these chars are designated as bc350 bc550 and bc750 respectively the details of the biochar production could be found in our previous work zhao et al 2018 the final temperature was held for 2 h and subsequently the harvested biochar was milled to pass through a 200 mesh sieve for comparison a commercially available activated carbon ac with similar particle size was purchased from nanjing chemical reagent co ltd china detailed information for biomass pretreatment biochar production and biochar characterization are presented in the supporting information section s1 and s2 biochar properties are shown in table 1 2 2 preparation of phenol degrading bacterium the phenol degrading bacterium pseudomonas citronellolis was purchased from china agricultural microbial species conservation and management center strain no accc 02839 the bacterium is gram negative and aerobic and it can use phenol as the sole carbon and energy source the detailed culture method for this strain is presented in section s3 to verify the biochar s role as a supporter or shelter of microbes the strains were immobilized in biochar with calcium alginate to form small black pellets and their capacity to degrade phenol was tested in aqueous solution with high phenol concentrations of 600 800 1 000 and 1200 mg l 1 detailed steps can be seen in section s3 2 3 phenol removal experiments biodegradation of phenol with different initial concentrations from 100 to 1200 mg l 1 was performed with 4 w v pseudomonas citronellolis inoculation in the presence or absence of biochar and the mixtures were incubated at 30 c and 160 rpm samples were taken to determine the phenol concentration with high performance liquid chromatography breeze hplc waters corp usa detailed steps for preparation of phenol solution and measurement conditions can be seen in section s4 the adsorption desorption experiments and kinetics fitting were conducted to investigate how biochar could storage and release phenol therefore influences the equilibrium between toxicity and bioavailability of phenol to bacteria the lagergren first order kinetics pseudo second order kinetics and molecular diffusion model were used to fit the phenol adsorption and desorption kinetics detailed information on the experimental methods and kinetics fitting can be seen in section s5 2 4 distinguishing adsorbed phenol from degraded phenol in order to distinguish the adsorbed phenol from the degraded phenol the residual phenol in the aqueous phase and the extracted phenol from the solid phase biochar should be measured several extracts were tested including ethanol alcohol tetrachloromethane and acetonitrile to select a highly efficient extraction agent and finally the acetonitrile water system high polarity logkow 1 46 high solubility in water 80 g l 1 was chosen because a satisfactory phenol recovery can be obtained fig s1 the recovery efficiency of phenol from bc350 separated from the system with a phenol concentration of 30 600 mg l 1 was 100 for bc550 and bc750 the recovery efficiencies of phenol were 88 1 100 and 67 2 84 9 respectively fig s1 in contrast phenol was easily to be detached from ac even more than 100 desorption was detected at a low concentration of 100 mg l 1 fig s1 this was due to the activated carbon itself contained a small amount of phenol which was detected in the blank ac extraction a linear relationship was found between the recovery efficiency and the initial phenol concentration r2 0 970 and the slope was not high fig s1 which is the basis for calculating the total residual phenol in the degradation system 2 5 identifying biochar s alkalinity in relieving acid inhibition on bacterium effects of ph on the growth of microbes were firstly tested in different initial phs 3 72 6 54 7 10 and 7 60 and the increase of optical density at 600 nm od600 was measured to verify the contribution of minerals to alkalinity of biochar another biochar was specially prepared by hcl rinsing nan et al 2019 and referred to as demineralized biochar dm bc550 briefly 5 g bc550 was suspended in 50 ml 2 m hcl in an erlenmeyer flask and horizontally shaken for 4 h at 30 c and 160 rpm biochar was filtered using a 0 45 μm filter and rinsed with deionized water until the ph of the filtrate remained constant the harvested dm bc550 was used as a comparison with bc550 to explore how minerals in biochar buffer the ph and influence the microbial growth samples were taken at 4 h and 40 h for the measurement of phenol and ph and concentration of ca ii and mg ii was detected with an inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer 5110 icp oes agilent technologies inc usa 2 6 verifying soluble organic substances in biochar as substrates the soluble organic substances were extracted from the biochars and used to cultivate the strains bc350 bc550 and bc750 were added to the inorganic medium section s3 at a ratio of 0 6 w v and then oscillated at 30 c and 160 rpm for 8 h after filtering through a 0 45 μm filter membrane and sterilization the aqueous extracts were labeled as water bc350 water bc550 and water bc750 these extracts were used to prepare phenol solution of 600 mg l 1 and inoculated with 4 the strains samples of 0 5 ml were taken at regular intervals to monitor the phenol concentration and ph value in the liquid phase other 1 6 ml samples were used to detect the species and relative concentration of organics by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms 7890b pegasus bt agilent technologies inc usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 significant promotion of biodegradation of phenol by biochar the removal dynamics of phenol at initial concentrations from 100 mg l 1 to 1200 mg l 1 by pseudomonas citronellolis are presented in fig 1 satisfactory removal could only be obtained in low phenol concentrations of 100 and 200 mg l 1 at which the removal efficiencies were 100 and 80 while the values were only 20 40 at the relatively high phenol concentrations of 400 and 800 mg l 1 and the bacterium even failed to survive at the high concentrations of 1000 and 1200 mg l 1 the starting time of phenol degradation was also greatly delayed at high concentrations fig 1 the growth of strains in different initial phenol concentrations was tested as shown in fig s2 the low phenol concentration of 100 mg l 1 allowed the strains to grow the fastest while the final bacterial concentration od600 value of 0 06 was significantly lower than that of the system with phenol concentrations of 200 mg l 1 and 400 mg l 1 od600 value of 0 12 the observation indicated that low phenol concentration could not provide enough carbon source which was rapidly consumed by the strains in contrast the relatively high phenol concentration of 400 mg l 1 exhibited an obviously toxic inhibitory effect on microbial growth and the final concentration of the bacterium did not exceed those in the system with 200 mg l 1 phenol can be considered as a toxic substance at high concentrations and as a carbon source for microbes at low concentrations growth of bacterium in all systems presented a strong correlation with reduced phenol concentration fig s2 this proved that although high concentrations of phenol provided sufficient metabolic substrates the toxicity eventually inhibited the metabolism of phenol by microbes with the incorporation of biochar with the bacterium removal of phenol in all conditions was promoted significantly fig 2 firstly effects of biochar addition into the systems were compared among biochars produced at different temperatures fig 2a a relative long stagnation was observed compared with all the following experiments because this was the first batch of the experiments and the strains were still in the adaptive stage of phenol even so all biochar showed a rapid decrease of phenol at the beginning due to the adsorption by biochar the highest strengthening effect was obtained by bc550 dose and it greatly accelerated the biodegradation and made a sudden reduction of phenol at about 20 h compared with the control without biochar addition fig 2a bc350 also achieved a high final removal rate with a 10 h lag phase compared to the bc550 however in the bc750 system bacterium could not survive successfully and only adsorbed about 25 of phenol this was probably because of the high alkalinity ph 11 2 of bc750 table 1 resulting in the failure of tolerance of strains to the high concentration of phenol 800 mg l 1 the specific surface areas of bc350 bc550 and bc750 were 11 143 and 304 m2 g 1 respectively table 2 which did not present obvious correlation with the adsorption amount some other mechanisms may be responsible for the phenol adsorption to biochar chen et al 2008 effects of different biochar dose ratios 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 w v and different pyrolytic temperatures 350 c 550 c and 750 c on phenol degradation were also investigated compared with fig 2a adaptive strains were used in all the following experiments results showed that high dose ratio of biochar could increase the initial reduction of phenol concentration via adsorption while the final degradation efficiency might depend on whether the microbes can survive fig 2b for phenol concentrations of 600 800 1 000 and 1200 mg l 1 2 w v biochar addition resulted in final phenol removal of 46 9 36 9 35 1 and 33 7 respectively fig 2c being much higher than 29 6 24 5 0 and 0 without biochar addition fig 1 to further improve the phenol removal at higher concentrations the strains were immobilized in biochar with calcium alginate an interesting result was that much higher degradation efficiencies were achieved 98 9 90 5 69 6 and 62 5 respectively even for the highest initial phenol concentration of 1200 mg l 1 fig 2d while the samples without biochar failed to degrade phenol fig s3 it was guessed that higher biochar addition would be more effective in facilitating the microbes to survive to achieve a high biodegradation efficiency 3 2 biochar as shelter for microbes to protect them against adverse environment biochar is a porous material with an inhomogeneous and coarse pore structure yang et al 2016 most biochars are mesoporous with pore sizes of 2 30 nm and total pore volumes in the range 0 01 0 3 cm3 g 1 zhao et al 2014 in this study the total pore volumes of bc350 bc550 and bc750 were 0 089 0 131 and 0 174 cm3 g 1 respectively table 2 the specific surface area of biochar was about 10 300 m2 g 1 which was much lower than that of ac 800 1200 m2 g 1 such a matrix was assumed to act as a shelter or supporter for microbes fig 3 is the surface morphology of bacteria attached to biochar probed by scanning electron microscope the images clearly show that due partly to the electrostatic adsorption the bacterium could go either into the biochar pores or attach to the biochar surface this relatively loose fixation of microbes by biochar seemed to facilitate microbial growth and promote reproduction to investigate whether the fixation of bacterium could help them resist highly toxic contaminants they were immobilized in biochar with calcium alginate gel the black pellets were used to degrade phenol at high concentrations 600 1200 mg l 1 and the results were compared with those pellets that immobilized strains only by calcium alginate gel without biochar as supporter fig s3 the photographs can be seen in fig s4 the black pellets with biochar in them showed an obvious stronger tolerance to high concentrations of phenol and obtained a 100 degradation rate in the 600 mg l 1 phenol wastewater which was much higher than that without biochar specially the pellets that formed only with calcium alginate immobilization in the absence of biochar also showed about 40 80 degradation in the initial phenol concentrations of 600 1000 mg l 1 while a failure of survive was observed in concentration of 1200 mg l 1 fig s3 even being lower than only biochar addition 30 0 fig 2c in addition bacterium began to degrade phenol more quickly in biochar system than only by calcium alginate immobilization results indicated that biochar could act as a supporter sheltering the microbes against the adverse environment 3 3 adsorption desorption of phenol by biochar related to biodegradation the adsorption capacity of bc350 bc550 and bc750 for phenol was tested in the absence of microbes with ac used as a contrast bc350 bc550 and bc750 exhibited a comparable adsorption capacity 28 2 28 9 and 32 2 mg g 1 respectively which were much lower than that of ac 85 1 mg g 1 table s2 moreover the adsorption process of the biochar was relatively slow and lasted for more than 12 h but that of ac was very fast and took only 5 min to reach equilibrium fig 4 a the adsorption process of biochar was more fitting with pseudo second order kinetics r2 0 999 which was consistent with previous studies qian et al 2009 ngigi et al 2019 in addition the adsorption kinetic coefficients k2 and initial adsorption rate u of the biochars could be ranked as follows bc350 bc750 bc550 fig 4a table s2 the adsorption thermodynamics experiments showed that phenol adsorption by bc350 and ac were more consistent with the freundlich isothermal adsorption model r2 0 999 and 0 996 respectively while that of bc750 fitted well with the langmuir isothermal adsorption model r2 0 997 and those of bc550 were very close to each other r2 0 996 and 0 995 table s3 xiao and pignatello 2016 liang et al 2019 desorption of phenol from biochar fitted pseudo second order kinetics r2 0 999 fig 4b the final desorption percentages were 60 6 19 9 11 7 and 23 8 for bc350 bc550 bc750 and ac respectively table s4 most of the phenol adsorbed in bc350 was easily desorbed while minor of the phenol adsorbed in bc550 and bc750 could be desorbed indicating a lower binding energy state between phenol and bc350 there were abundant functional groups in bc350 thus the adsorption of phenol by bc350 was mainly via the partition of aliphatic carbon and the complex structure of the electron donor acceptor formed by the surface electron donor groups and phenol molecules saquing et al 2016 zhang et al 2018c in contrast bc550 and bc750 contained less surface functional groups whereas their micropore surface area 341 and 457 m2 g 1 and micropore volume 0 131 and 0 174 cm3 g 1 were much higher than bc350 222 m2 g 1 and 0 089 cm3 g 1 table 2 hadi et al demonstrated the significance of micropore surface area rather than total surface area in the adsorption of phenol charcoal materials with higher fraction of micropores will uptake higher phenol which could be attributed to the π π london dispersion forces between the graphitic carbon basal planes and the phenol aromatic ring hadi et al 2015 ghafari et al 2019 this high binding force would resist the detachment of phenol which is disadvantageous to its degradation fu et al 2018 luo et al 2019 the phenol had been adsorbed by biochar must has a tendency to be desorbed when biodegradation induced a sharp decrease of phenol concentration in liquid phase with a re distribution of phenol in solid liquid phases thus affecting their further biodegradation due to the micropore diameter of biochar was less than 2 nm not only the bacteria pseudomonas citronellolis with cell size between 1 5 2 μm 0 6 0 8 μm cannot directly contact the phenol in the adsorbed state but also extracellular enzymes with diameters of 1 100 nm cannot reach the adsorbed phenol fuchs et al 1988 even for the microbes inhabiting in the biochar pores metabolization of the phenol in the solid phase would consume too much of their energy esfanjani et al 2018 therefore if the phenol desorption speed is lower than its consumption speed desorption would become the limiting step of phenol degradation fig 5 shows the distribution of phenol in the liquid phase and in biochar during degradation clearly the phenol in bc350 decreased significantly with a sharp reduction of phenol in aqueous solution finally the phenol in both aqueous solution and solid were completely degraded at about 20 h and 30 h fig 5a d however there was still a high fraction of phenol retained in bc550 and bc750 matrix until 50 h even when all the phenol in the aqueous solution had been consumed this might indicate that desorption limited the microbial degradation fig 5b and c and this fraction of unavailable phenol for bacterium was possibly present in micropores of biochar formed at higher temperature therefore a moderate capacity of biochar for adsorbing and desorbing phenol was preferred to maintain an equilibrium between phenol s roles as a carbon source and a toxin 3 4 key role of biochar s alkalinity in relieving acid inhibition on bacterium one of the main factors influencing microbial growth and enzyme activity is ph fidel et al 2017 in this study response of pseudomonas citronellolis toward various initial ph values 3 70 7 60 was investigated obviously pseudomonas sp was more adaptable to higher ph 6 50 7 60 and neither dissipation of phenol nor bacterial growth occurred when ph was 3 72 fig s5 even at a slightly acidic ph of 6 54 the growth of the strain was significantly inhibited compared with its growth at ph 7 1 accordingly the final removal efficiency of phenol was sharply reduced by 17 1 in contrast when ph increased to 7 6 a significant promotion of microbial growth was obtained the increasing of ph by only 0 5 units promoted bacterial growth by 46 2 and phenol degradation by 15 4 figs s5a and b and the linear relationship in figs s5c and d shows that pseudomonas sp was highly sensitive to ph metabolism of phenol by pseudomonas sp is driven by a series of enzyme catalyzed bioreactions as shown in fig s6 for the ortho cleavage pathway in pseudomonas citronellolis used in this study phenol is firstly transformed to catechol by hydroxylase and later to a sequence of low weight carboxylic acids including cis cis muconic acid and β ketoadipate santos et al 2007 finally phenol and all intermediate products could be completely degraded after the tricarboxylic acid cycle in this study the fast reduction of ph accompanied by the sudden decrease of phenol concentration indicated that formation of catechol happened rapidly whereas the subsequent steps were relatively slow in consuming the acids the large amounts of acidic intermediates accumulated and would damage the microbes if nothing was done in this case the alkalinity of biochar began to neutralize acids and played a key role in facilitating the microbes to survive it has been proved that alkalinity of biochar is largely derived from carbonate and the deprotonated surficial oxygen containing functional groups developed during pyrolysis yuan et al 2011 to elucidate the source of the alkalinity a biochar with minerals removed was prepared which is referred to as dm bc550 as expected dm bc550 almost has no ph buffering capacity thus ph of the system decreased to 3 5 3 7 after 16 h being similar to that of the control which resulted in a poor phenol degradation fig 6 a and b the concentration of ca and mg in the liquid phase before and after the biodegradation was measured fig 6c and d at the beginning addition of bc550 increased ca and mg concentration to about 15 mg l 1 and 7 0 mg l 1 respectively indicating that biochar contained a large amount of soluble ca and mg when phenol degradation was carried out for 40 h the ca2 almost doubled in the system with bc550 however this large release of ca2 was not observed in the control dm bc550 and ac systems compared with ca2 the release amount of mg2 could be neglected zhao et al 2018 these results proved that slow dissolution of ca minerals enabled microbes to resist the inhibition caused by the accumulation of acidic intermediates and significantly improved the final phenol degradation efficiency x ray diffraction analysis of bc550 and dm bc550 indicated the presence of caco3 in bc550 but not in dm bc550 fig s7 in addition by comparing their fourier transform infrared spectra fig s8 no obvious differences can be observed for their alkaline functional groups thus minerals were the most contribution to the significant alkalinity of biochar biochar s ph buffering capacity increased with elevated pyrolysis temperature fig s9 bc350 also had enough buffering capacity though its ph was lower 7 16 than bc550 10 5 and bc750 11 2 table 1 and when large acids were generated during biodegradation of phenol bc350 also could increase the ph to a level that enabled microbe s survival the x ray diffraction spectrum showed that at higher pyrolysis temperature calcium oxalate cac2o4 in bc350 was transformed to caco3 in bc550 and further converted to cao in bc750 wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2018a in fig 6b the final ph in ac system was about 5 0 although it was acidic it is not to such an extent as to damage the bacterium compared with bc550 ac had a much lower ph buffering capacity while this was still higher than dm bc and the control with no carbon materials therefore the stagnate stage was very long in the ac system when the bacterium adapted to this environment and survived it could degrade phenol sharply and decreased ph suddenly 25 30 h after that a rebound of ph was observed in ac system which might be induced by the adsorption of small molecule acids to ac these results clearly showed that the final degradation efficiency depended on whether microbes can survive which corelated to the ph buffering ability of an added material 3 5 biochar s soluble organic substances as substrates for bacteria water soluble compounds in fresh biochar was reported to promote or restrict cell growth and such effect is also strain dependent liu et al 2019 yang et al 2019 extracts from the three biochars water bc350 water bc550 and water bc750 plus extract from ac were used as substrate solution to cultivate the bacterium and degrade the phenol as seen in fig 7 a the stagnation of bacterium was water bc750 water bc550 ac water bc350 in all systems ph decreased significantly with the rapid degradation of phenol and remained approximately at 4 0 which was similar to the results for free microbes fig 7b it was obvious that these extracts almost had not ph buffering capacity therefore bacterium stopped work after about 50 70 and 80 of final phenol degradation in the systems of control water bc550 and water bc750 respectively however in the water bc350 system bacterium survived and degraded the phenol again after a temporary stagnation this was because the amounts of extracted compounds were significantly higher in water bc350 than in the other systems table 3 which can also be seen clearly from the brown color in fig s10 graber et al 2014 smith et al 2016 ghidotti et al 2017 similar phenomenon to water bc350 was observed in water ac system due to the relative higher extracted compounds concentration the relative abundances of all organic compounds detected by gc ms at representative sampling times during degradation were listed in table s5 the components were very complex including mainly chain alkane carboxylic acids hydroxyl carboxylic acids phenolic carboxylic acids etc some of them were of high concentration at the beginning and decreased significantly along the biodegradation indicating that these compounds were derived from the extracted substances of the biochars these substances were presented in table 3 some of the other substances only appeared after biodegradation which were assumed to be the intermediates of phenol degradation such as catechol cis cis muconic acid and β ketoadipate fig s11 this relative change of the organic compounds was sufficient to show that biochar dissolution promoted the growth and degradation activity of microbes compared with the blank control in addition the reduction of various monocyclic aromatic compounds such as 3 4 dihydroxybenzoic acid salicylaldehyde and 2 methylbenzoic acid was observed at the initial stage of phenol degradation table 3 phenol has been reported widely as a growth substrate that can co metabolism with many other more refractory compounds and enhance their degradation shi et al 2015 phenol hydroxylase is known to involve in the first step of phenol degradation which belongs to bacterial monooxygenases tran et al 2013 these monocyclic aromatic compounds provided an abundance of carbon and energy sources to improve the phenol hydroxylase activity xiao et al 2019a 2019b as williams and sayers 1994 reported these compounds were first inserted into hydroxyl groups by single or double oxygenase then oxygen atoms were added to open the loop and finally they were broken into small aliphatic compounds to enter the core metabolic cycle of microbes 4 conclusions biochar exhibited significant promotion to the biodegradation of phenol especially at concentrations of above 400 mg l 1 and immobilizing the bacterium in biochar with calcium alginate further strengthened their tolerance to high concentration of phenol as 1200 mg l 1 bacterium enhanced the phenol biodegradation via multi pathways depending on stages and pyrolysis temperatures biochar adsorbed phenol at the initial stage of the reaction and alleviated its toxicity to bacterium the pore structure of biochar enabled bacterium to inhabit in it against the adverse environment at the logarithmic degradation period fast generation and accumulation of acidic intermediates posed damage to bacterium while they could be rescued by biochar as an alkaline source the subsequent gradual desorption of phenol from biochar could facilitate the bacterium to acquire phenol in this regard bc350 showed a comparable sorption capacity with bc550 and bc750 while a higher desorption potential than them thus balanced better the toxicity and bioavailability of phenol to bacterium at last soluble small organic molecules from biochar promoted the growth of bacterium as substrates and accelerated phenol degradation this study provides an environmentally friendly and cost effective technology for promoting biodegradation to practical application
