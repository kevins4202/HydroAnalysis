2825,the karst trough valley basin in zhongliang of chongqing is one of the most developed karst areas in southwest china with unique topographic features such as karst troughs and valleys that are prone to flash floods accurate simulation of flood processes in these areas using hydrological models can provide references for predicting future local runoff evolution trends the main challenge for hydrological modelling in karst areas lies in building a model with limited hydrogeological data in this study the karst liuxihe kl model was simplified and improved to simulate karst flood processes in the zhongliang karst trough valley the kl model consists of multiple complex structures a large amount of data is needed to model karst areas to overcome the modelling data requirements we modified the model structure and its parameters to propose a simplified kl skl model additionally we improved the runoff generation and confluence algorithms compared with the simulation results for 22 flood processes obtained by using the kl model the results for this skl model were better with less modelling data for example the mean value of the akaike information criterion aic index decreasing rate was 35 and the process relative error and the peak flow relative error decreased by 10 indicating that the technique of simplifying and improving the kl model is effective and that the simplified skl

valley areas vary greatly in time and space and are more anisotropic than those in nonkarst areas kurtulus and razack 2007 apollonio et al 2018 below the surface there are sinkholes shafts karst caves karst fissures and conduits crisscrossing the earth typically rainfall on the surface quickly flows through sinkholes or shafts into the underground river system and eventually exits through the karst river basin alberto and carmelo 2020 in the flood season heavy rains and floods frequently occur and the confluent flows to the outlets of the underground rivers reach high volumes in a short time often rapidly exceeding the discharge capacity yang et al 2020 overlimit floods occurring at the outlets of underground rivers cause flood related disasters there are many studies on flash flood simulation and forecasting in karst regions jourde et al 2013 demiroglu 2016 darras et al 2017 ravbar et al 2020 that can provide key technical means for regional flood control and mitigation kuriqi and hysa 2021 ilderomi et al 2022 bonacci et al 2006 described a flash flood in the dinaric karst region of croatia and its severe impact on the local karst area which suffered a vast loss especially from the economic aspect bailly et al 2012 used a conceptual semidistributed hydrological model to evaluate surface river karst groundwater interactions during flash floods in the mediterranean karst basin of the coulazou river fleury et al 2013 developed a conceptual hydrological model to study the karst aquifer response to rain events and to forecast dangerous karst flash flood events in the city of nimes southern france nannoni et al 2020 monitored an extreme storm in a complex alpine show karst cave the results confirmed that long term and well integrated monitoring can help in the simulation of karst flash floods in complex karst catchments this research on karst flood simulation and forecasting using hydrological models may provide key tools for regional flood mitigation pham 2021 however hydrological simulation and prediction in karst areas is much more difficult than that in nonkarst areas due to the influence of complex underlying surface runoff generation confluence characteristics and hydrogeological conditions in karst areas in addition the establishment of hydrological models in karst areas requires a large amount of hydrogeological data support which makes modelling extremely challenging this study takes the karst trough valley i e the zhongliang mountains watershed in southwest china as an example and attempts to establish a distributed hydrological model using less data than is demanded by the current commonly used karst groundwater numerical models such as the modflow cfp model that can effectively simulate karst flash flood events the research area is a trough valley in the zhongliang mountains a typical karst basin in chongqing china two trough valleys between the three hills of the trough and valley landscape provide favourable conditions for the formation and propagation of floods in recent years with the increase in the occurrence of extreme rainfall events and the unreasonable land development mode in the region flash floods have occurred frequently in the watershed causing serious economic losses wu et al 2018 therefore effective means should be adopted to accurately simulate karst flood disasters and quantitatively predict future flood evolution trends which can provide technical references for local non engineering flood control measures in this context hydrogeological models are useful tools the complex hydrogeological conditions and spatial variations that are characteristic of karst development in karst areas make it difficult to accurately quantify the water transport pattern in anisotropic karst aquifers with simple hydrological models ford and williams 2007 bailly et al 2012 a distributed model has potential in karst flood forecasting as it can divide the entire karst watershed into many karst subbasins eulogio et al 2018 thereby reflecting the characteristics of karst development and spatial differences in rainfall however distributed hydrological models usually have multiple structures and many parameters thus substantial hydrogeological data are usually needed to build models for karst areas kraller et al 2014 for example modflow cfp reimann and hill 2009 application in karst areas generally requires detailed information such as karst conduit distributions for which special borehole pumping experiments may be needed therefore the modelling cost is high li et al 2019 developed a distributed and physically based karst liuxihe kl model in the liujiang karst watershed in guangxi province china which has performed well in other karst regions li et al 2020 li et al 2021 however the application of the kl model in karst areas still has some shortcomings because the model structure and parameters are relatively complex for instance there are six layers of vertical structure in the kl model with fifteen parameters therefore the modelling data requirements are high for karst regions furthermore to obtain such data costly hydrogeological tests such as pumping tests may be needed to address the high demand for modelling data by the kl model we optimized the model structure and parameters improved the rainfall runoff algorithm and developed a simplified karst liuxihe skl model the simplifications are mainly reflected in the reduction of the model structure from six to four layers and the adjustment of parameters from fifteen to twelve the structure of the skl model is relatively simple and can be divided into just a surface and an underground double layer structure that requires limited hydrogeological data and information on karst aquifers the hydrogeological data for karst aquifers such as the distribution and direction of underground rivers can be deduced by tracer tests and no borehole pumping experiments are needed the main purpose of this study is to develop a physically based distributed hydrological model suitable for flood simulation and prediction in karst trough and valley basins which is achieved by simplifying the structure and parameters of the kl model and improving the algorithm of rainfall runoff generation and confluence in the skl model the relatively simple structures and parameters of this skl model require only a small amount of data for modelling in karst areas the reasonable flood simulation results show the potential and application value of the improved skl model in karst flood forecasting such as those found in the study area and provide a reasonable reference solution for local non engineering measures for flood prevention and mitigation moreover we seek to provide a theoretical reference for the use of limited data to build a distributed hydrological model in karst trough valley regions 2 study area and data 2 1 landforms and hydrogeological conditions the research area is the zhongliang mountains watershed in chongqing china which is located at 106 23 15 106 28 05 e and 29 40 30 29 48 10 n karst landforms are extremely well developed in this region the karst watershed has an area of 38 km2 and a humid subtropical monsoon climate and the average annual precipitation is approximately 1 082 6 mm the main types of land use are cultivated land forest grassland and karst waste land the main geological structure of the zhongliang mountains is the guanyinxia anticline where the exposed strata are mainly symmetrically distributed along the two limbs of the anticline to the core the strata in the anticlinal core are the lower triassic feixianguan formation t1f and gradually transition from the flanking strata into the lower series of the jialing river formation t1j the middle series of the leikoupo formation t2 l and the upper triassic xujiahe formation t3xj a fault the baimiaozi fault fig 1 b developed in the t1j formation on the western wing of the anticline which strikes roughly the same as the anticline axis carbonate rocks that are easily dissolved by karst water in the anticline core are surrounded by insoluble rock strata on both sides and there are two nne trending dissolution troughs in the east and west in the anticline core forming a pen rack topography of three mountains and two troughs fig 1b with an elevation of 480 640 m the first and third strata sections of t1f in the anticline core are karst aquifers where karst fissure systems and large karst underground conduits are densely distributed forming underground river systems the second and fourth sections are the t3xj and jurassic systems j which are water resistant layers that form the boundary of the underground river and block the underground hydraulic interaction between the anticlinal core and t1j and t2 l on both sides forming the following two relatively independent karst hydrogeological units the western karst trough valley t1j t2 l system and the eastern karst trough valley t1j t2 l system the fenghuang underground river is distributed in the eastern trough valley and flows into the jialing river at the outlet of the zhongliangshan karst basin fig 1a the northern and southern portions of the guanyinxia anticline are cut by the jialing river fig 1 and the yangtze river respectively the jialing river and yangtze river are surface nonkarst rivers the insoluble sandstone and mudstone are resistant to weathering and form ridges on the 2 limbs of the anticline fig 1b meanwhile karst water erodes the limestone and dolomite layers more easily than the sandstone and shale layers and this erosion has formed karst trough valleys which provide conditions conducive to flood propagation therefore the skl model was improved to effectively simulate karst flood processes which can provide technical support for local flood prevention and mitigation fig 1 shows the monitoring sites and their hypsometric curve land use and cross section of strata and the automatic gauging station in the basin the zhongliangshan watershed has both a buried karst landform and a large area with a bare karst landform distribution where the karst is well developed the surface of the karst trough valley is dominated by bare karst landforms while large karst conduits have developed underground forming an underground river system the underground river flow process line belongs to the response curve dominated by the karst conduit flow which shows the hydrological process dynamic characteristic line generally possessed by karst underground rivers in southwestern china rainfall is the main recharge water source of the fenghuang underground river fig 1a in the study area to determine the direction of the underground river and the regulation of rainfall infiltration water by karst water bearing media we conducted tracer tests and infiltration tests in the study area the results of the tracer test showed that the main body of the underground river system is a large karst conduit without obvious tributaries the closure condition of the underground watershed is good and there is no cross stream resupply water there are underground lakes in the underground river system these underground lakes can be considered reservoir units in the skl model their storage capacity was calculated using tracer material retention time and recovery the results of the infiltration test showed that the karstification depth during a flash flood is approximately 0 5 10 m underground where the epikarst zone plays a significant role in regulating and storing rainfall infiltration the karst fissure system can host many slow flow streams while fast flowing water quickly flows into the underground river through the wide conduit system the outlet flow of the fenghuang underground river responds very quickly to the rainfall process and the tracer test showed that the underground river can reach the flood peak flow after 6 7 h of rainfall the underground river outlet level rises and falls within the range of approximately 0 58 1 24 m during flooding in addition the results of rainstorm monitoring and infiltration tests in the study area showed that the karst groundwater level rise responds very quickly to rainfall while its recession process is relatively slow in response to rainfall the karst groundwater level rises rapidly in response to persistent heavy rainfall because rainfall is the main source of groundwater recharge in the region while its fall process is slow because many karst fissure water bearing systems are endowed with a large amount of infiltrated water during flash floods this water is slowly released into the underground river system after rainfall therefore the process of groundwater level recovery is long lasting and slow usually returning to its original position 5 7 days after rainfall occurs the typicality of the basin is mainly reflected in its landform of three mountains with two trough valleys this basin is an extension of the eastern sichuan parallel ridge valley landform it is a type of basin found throughout southwestern china especially in chongqing karst areas such as the qingmuguan karst basin and laolongdong karst basin in the nanshan district as well as this study area i e the zhongliangshan karst trough valley therefore the improved skl model in this study can also be applied to the flood simulation and forecasting of these karst areas in chongqing 2 2 modelling data the modelling data mainly refer to the digital elevation model dem land use and soil type data as well as rainfall observational data and flood events the free dem land use and soil data are downloaded from network databases and the initial resolutions are 30 30 m 1000 1000 m and 1000 1000 m respectively the links to download the data are provided in the data availability section of this article to create a model with these free data resampling is needed at a suitable spatial resolution determined by the size of the study area avand et al 2021 the study area is small i e only 38 km2 therefore to describe the karst characteristics and the hydrological processes of rainfall runoff in great detail the spatial resolution of the dem land use and soil type were resampled to 15 15 m based on the spatial discrete method by berry et al 2010 according to our previous modelling tests in this study area the river system extracted from the model at a spatial resolution of 15 m is basically consistent with the actual situation observed in google earth which is better than those at 30 m and 10 m or lower indicating that a resolution of 15 m for the dem land use and soil type is feasible twenty two karst flood events from 2018 to 2019 affecting the fenghuang underground river were selected to test the validity and applicability of the kl model and skl model in this study these karst flood processes consist mainly of rainfall in the basin and discharge from the underground river outlet the humid subtropical monsoon climate brings abundant rainfall to the basin for which the annual precipitation is approximately 1100 1300 mm however there are obvious differences in rainfall seasons with rainfall mainly concentrated in april october with most of the rainstorms occurring in june and july the precipitation is lowest in january the average monthly rainfall is less than 5 of the annual rainfall the recharge source of karst water resources in the underground river system basically comes from rainfall in the upper boundary and most of the precipitation collects in the depression at the trough bottom along the slope and replenishes the underground river system in the form of plane distributed infiltration through surface fissures and centralized injection through sinkholes therefore the underground river dynamics in the area belong to the rainfall source meteorological type and the corresponding curves of water level and flow at the outlet of the underground river with rainfall belong to obvious response curves dominated by conduit flow the water level and flow dynamics change synchronously with rainfall and are very sensitive to precipitation response showing the dynamic line characteristic of hydrological processes commonly found in karst underground rivers in southwest china the season for underground river flooding in the area is also consistent with the rainy season i e from april to october and underground river floods are frequent during the heavy rainfall season in june and july while the water level of underground rivers is extremely low in january and february and the rivers often become dry during this time an artificial open channel was built at the outlet of the underground river and an automatic gauging station fig 1d was installed to observe the water level in real time then the flow rate was calculated according to the equation with the water level and flow relationship in the triangular weir of the rectangular open channel 30 cm right isosceles triangle generally the time resolution for hydrological simulations is 1 h to further refine the simulations the time resolution was set to 15 min in this study fig 2 shows the dem and the soil types while the land use type is shown in fig 1a 3 methodology 3 1 the kl model li et al 2019 proposed the kl model as an improvement to the terrestrial liuxihe model the liuxihe model chen 2009 is a physically based distributed hydrological model that functions as a terrestrial hydrological model and is suitable for flood forecasting of surface rivers the model code is open source and free to use the model is relatively easy to build and all the modelling data are available at no cost on the internet which gives the liuxihe model great application potential the liuxihe model has been successfully applied to several watersheds including but not limited to reservoir inlet flood forecasting chen et al 2016 xing et al 2022 small and medium river flood forecasting chen 2018 li et al 2021 and flash flood early warning forecasting macalalad et al 2021 to make the liuxihe model applicable to karst areas li et al 2019 improved the model structure and algorithm of runoff generation and confluence to develop the kl model the application effects in many karst areas show that this improved kl model is suitable for karst flood simulation and prediction li et al 2020 li et al 2021 however the structure of the kl model is quite complex in particular the vertical structure of the model is divided into six layers moreover fifteen parameters need to be optimized resulting in a great demand for modelling data in karst areas and a high modelling cost for example to obtain the rock porosity and permeability coefficient a borehole pumping test is needed 3 2 the skl model to address the difficulty of high demand for modelling data of the kl model in karst areas we propose the simplified skl model based on the kl model where the simplifications are mainly accomplished through the use of the following two processes simplifying the structure and parameters of the kl model and improving the runoff generation and confluence algorithms to develop the skl model therefore the main difference between these two models is also reflected in two aspects first the structures and parameters of the two models are quantitatively different there are six vertical structures and fifteen parameters in the kl model while there are four vertical structures with twelve parameters in the skl model therefore compared with the kl model which has a more complex structure and parameters the simplified skl model has a relatively simple structure and the amount of hydrogeological data required for modelling is greatly reduced second the runoff generation and confluence algorithms are improved in the skl model to ensure that the performance of the model does not deteriorate after its structure and parameters are optimized generally after the structure and parameters of the hydrological model are simplified its performance may be reduced to a certain extent in terms of mechanism that is the effects of flood simulation and prediction become worse and at the same time the uncertainty of flood prediction of the simplified model becomes larger therefore we enhance the optimized skl model mainly by advancing its rainfall runoff algorithm reflected in the algorithm optimization of runoff yield and confluence and refining the parameter calibration method these actions improve the performance of the skl model and reduce its uncertainty in karst flood simulation and forecasting in the performance test of the model the simplification effect and accuracy of the model are evaluated by comparing the simulation results of karst floods between the two models the difference between the two models mainly represented by our simplification of the kl model is as follows 1 simplifying the model structure and parameters the kl model which has a relatively complex structure contains the following six vertical structures vegetation cover ground layer soil layer rock layer in the epikarst zone underground river system and deep karst zone we redesigned its vertical structure according to the characteristics of underground runoff generation and confluence the spatial structure of the skl model is reduced from six to the following four layers the vegetation cover soil layer rock stratum and underground river system both models have the same horizontal structure that is they both contain the following three horizontal structures river channel cells slope cells and reservoir cells the simplified vertical model structure can be represented by the subsurface vertical structure of karst hydrological response units khrus in the kl model the entire karst watershed is divided into many karst subbasins within the dem li et al 2019 the selected karst subbasin units are the smallest computation unit in the model this division method is feasible for flood forecasting in large karst watersheds li et al 2020 however the division of karst subbasin units is too rough for very small karst watersheds such as the research area in this study i e the zhongliang mountains watershed which has an area of 38 km2 considering that dem data with a spatial resolution of 15 15 m were used to divide the karst subbasin units in this study it is possible to delineate only a small number of karst subbasins for a small karst basin such as the one in the study area hence the differences in karst development of the underlying basin surface cannot be fully reflected thus the law of runoff generation and confluence cannot be accurately depicted to describe the underlying surface of karst watersheds in more detail recognize different karst water bearing media and depict the water movement within these media using the skl model these karst subbasins are further divided into a series of khrus by combining arcgis 10 2 software with the skl model the kl model comprises only karst subbasins and has no khrus while the skl model comprises the divided khrus karst subbasins the procedures for defining and calculating these khrus follow the case studies of hydrological response units hrus in the topmodel by pan 2014 and in the swat model by ren 2006 after the khrus are divided all of the hydrological processes within them such as rainfall interpolation and runoff generation and confluence as well as parametric optimization are calculated the khrus are small enough to ignore the spatial differences in the underlying surface conditions of the karst basin allowing the maximum use of limited hydrogeological data to build the skl model in the vertical subsurface structure of these khrus in the skl model there are four layers as follows vegetation cover epikarst zone including the soil layer and shallow karst fissure and conduit systems rock strata and underground river system compared with the six vertical structures in the kl model there are fewer modelling data requirements for the skl model in addition compared with the rough karst subbasin units divided in the kl model the divided khrus in the skl model can better describe the underlying karst surface allowing for the recognition of different karst water bearing media and the effective calculation of the underground water movement within them fig 3 shows the structural diagram of the khrus which can reflect the spatial structure of karst aquifers once the model structure has been adjusted the parameters need to be optimized accordingly the parameters are simplified from fifteen in the kl model to twelve in the skl model the three parameters omitted from the skl model are the potential evaporation rate wilting coefficient and attenuation coefficient of the underground runoff table 1 shows the parameters in the kl model 2 improved runoff generation and confluence algorithms to ensure that the model performance is not diminished after the model structure and parameters are simplified we make specific improvements to the algorithms for runoff generation and confluence to improve the model accuracy the kl model does not include algorithms for the excess infiltration runoff generation in the exposed karst landforms as it assumes that all rainfall will infiltrate the karst aquifer system hence only the runoff generation under the saturated buried karst zone is calculated however when the net rainfall the amount of rainfall after vegetation interception and evaporation reaches the exposed karst landforms excess surface infiltration runoff may be generated in the khrus this excess runoff is considered in the skl model which was calculated as follows 1 r si 0 p i i f r si p i f i p i i f i f b f c f s δ f f where rsi is the depth of the excess infiltration of surface runoff mm pi is the rainfall after the removal of water loss from vegetation interception and evaporation mm if is the infiltration capacity of the epikarst zone mm fi is the water seepage in the surface karst zone mm b and δ are constants that can be determined by the infiltration test and fc fs and ff are the field capacity actual soil moisture and water volume of steady seepage mm respectively the kl model assumes that all the infiltrated rainfall will enter the underground river directly and does not consider confluence calculations in the soil interflow while in the skl model we subdivide the infiltrated runoff generation into the following two components the interflow in the soil layer and the runoff in the underground river these components are described as follows chen 2018 2 q rih v rih w z q rih x w z s t q ri q riv q riv q r i v 0 exp a t b 3 v rih k tan α f s f c v rih 0 f s f c where q rih and v rih are the interflow into the soil layer l s 1 and its flow velocity m s 1 respectively w z is the discharge section area of the interflow cm2 q rih x is the interflow in the horizontal direction of the soil layer l s 1 and s t is its confluence velocity cm s 1 qri is the net rainfall infiltration moisture in the epikarst zone at time t l s 1 q riv is the water seepage into the underground river l s 1 q r i v 0 is the average seepage into the vertical soil layer l s 1 a and b are constants determined by the infiltration test k is the permeability coefficient in the epikarst zone m s 1 and α is the hydraulic gradient of the interflow the rainfall infiltration water movement in the epikarst zone is divided into rapid flow and slow flow rapid flow occurs in macrofractures such as karst conduits sinkholes or underground river systems the water regulation of the rapid flow for rainfall infiltration is ignored due to its weak storage functions slow flow refers to water movement through tiny karst fissures which plays an important role in regulating and storing rainfall infiltration water the slow fissure flow in the epikarst zone is described as follows ren 2006 li et al 2019 4 sw q ind q crk w t 1 w t s w t 1 w inf t 1 w inf w 1 exp δ t t t ac t t ac θ sat θ fc k where sw and sw t 1 are the slow flow in the tiny karst fissures at time t and t 1 respectively l s 1 qinf is the rainfall infiltration water in the epikarst zone l s 1 q crk is the rapid flow in the macrocracks l s 1 wt and wt 1 are the water content of the slow flow at time t and t 1 respectively l s 1 winf and winf t 1 are the flow from the epikarst zone to the underground river at time t and t 1 respectively l s 1 δt is the calculated time step hours ttac is the attenuation coefficient of underground runoff θ sat is the saturation water content in the epikarst zone θ fc is the field capacity and k is the saturated hydraulic conductivity the muskingum model which is usually applied to the flood confluence of surface rivers dooge et al 1982 li et al 2019 is used in the kl model to calculate the confluence of the underground river during floods karst underground rivers are usually under pressure and saturated rainfall moisture infiltrating the underground river system can exhibit laminar or turbulent flow depending on the flow pattern at the time in the skl model the main confluent conduit of the underground river system is generalized into multiple sections connected by approximately circular pipelines in which the hagen poiseuille and darcy weisbach equations are employed to describe the confluence processes as follows valiantzas 2008 5 q l a ρ g d 2 δ h 32 μ τ δ l q t a 2g d δ h f δ l and 6 1 f 2 log k c 3 71 d 2 51 r e f r e vd v where ql is the laminar flow in the underground river l s 1 qt is the turbulent flow in the

gravitational acceleration 9 8 m s 2 v is the coefficient of kinematic viscosity which can be estimated by the groundwater temperature g is the gravitational acceleration m s 2 τ is the pipeline tortuosity δ h δ l is the hydraulic gradient which is the ratio of the water head difference to the length of the pipeline dimensionless f is the friction factor k c is the pipeline roughness m v is the flow rate of the pipeline m s 1 and r e is the reynolds number 3 3 parameter calibration in the kl model the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm is adopted to calibrate its parameters chen et al 2016 the basic pso algorithm can easily lead to local convergence with weak particle activity in the skl model the chaos factor pso cfpso algorithm is adopted to optimize its parameters where several cycles of chaotic disturbances are increased in the algorithm to improve its activity the inverse mapping equation for chaotic variables is as follows 7 x ij x min x max x min z ij z ij 1 c z c z ij where xij is the optimization variable xmin and xmax are its minimum and maximum respectively zij and z ij are the chaotic variables before and after the disturbances are added respectively z is the chaotic variable formed when the optimal particle maps to the interval 0 1 and c is determined by the adaptive method where it determines the strength of the disturbance that is added 0 c 1 3 4 methods of uncertainty analysis the uncertainty analysis of model simulation results is very important for distributed hydrological models the uncertainties in the model input parameters and model structure determine the uncertainty of the final model performance krzysztofowicz 2014 for the kl model only the parameter sensitivity is analysed while for the skl model the rainfall input model structure and parameter uncertainties are evaluated in detail in the skl model a multiparameter sensitivity analysis mpsa algorithm choi et al 1999 is adopted to calculate the parameter sensitivities for which the nash sutcliffe coefficient and the water balance coefficient are selected to form a multiple objective function the former represents the degree of coincidence between the simulated flow of the floods and the observed values while the latter reflects the difference between the simulated and observed total water amounts the combination of the two coefficients can basically reflect the effects of the model on karst flood simulations liu et al 2019 the multiple objective functions are as follows 8 c 1 i 1 n q i q i 2 i 1 n q i q 2 w i 1 n q i i 1 n q i i 1 n q i where c is the nash sutcliffe coefficient dimensionless qi and q i are the observed and simulated values of the peak discharges respectively l s 1 q is the average observed value of the peak discharge l s 1 n is the observed period and w is the value of the water balance coefficient the multiple objective function is defined as f i ω 1 1 c ω 2 1 w i 1 2 3 and the weight coefficients ω 1 and ω 2 are listed in table 2 3 5 model setup the model setup mainly refers to the preprocessing of basic modelling data and some initial condition settings before model calibration and running in the study area the watershed is divided into 168 889 khrus using 15 15 m dem data in the skl model which includes 14 550 surface river cells 128 520 hill slope cells and 25 819 underground river cells among which there are 1080 underground reservoir cells after the model framework is built a series of initial conditions is needed to determine the hydrological simulation 1 the initial range of soil water content is set to 30 90 of saturated water content which is based on the 22 flood simulation tests by the models in the study area during floods the soil water content before each flood is different and needs to be determined by a series of model run tests the initial state of the underground river is automatically monitored in real time by setting up an artificial gauging station at its outlet the river base flow is approximately 35 l s 1 based on the multiyear average dry season runoff in the basin 2 the groundwater divide can be determined based on the preliminary analysis of the stratigraphic structure and flow field in the study area the waterhead boundary conditions of the model are determined where a stable water level near the groundwater divide is selected as the boundary of the fixed waterhead 3 the initial values of the parameters are determined based on their physical characteristics to optimize the model parameters 4 dem soil type and land use data as well as rainfall and flow data are adopted to simulate the flood processes based on the kl and skl models the performance of the simplified and improved model is tested in this study the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 correlation coefficient process relative error peak flow relative error water balance coefficient and peak time error are used to evaluate the performance of the models in flood simulations the smaller the aic value is the better the fit degree is indicating that the model works better the aic index can be calculated as follows 9 ai c 1 n ln 1 n i 1 n q i q i 2 n 2 p a i c 2 m ln 1 m i 1 m q i q i 2 m 2 p a i c 1 ai c 1 d a i c 2 where the aic index consists of the parameter calibration period aic 1 and model validation period aic 2 values qi and q i are the observed and simulated values of the peak discharges respectively l s 1 n and m are the sample numbers in the calibration and validation periods p is the number of model parameters which are different in the two models fifteen in the kl model and twelve in the skl model and d is the pondage factor which can be obtained by model trial calculation 4 results 4 1 results of parametric optimization a total of twenty two karst flood events were collected for this study among them the input data including the first three consecutive flood events in the calibration period were used to optimize the model parameters and the remaining data of the validated datasets were used to evaluate the performances of the kl and skl models in this study fig 4 shows the karst flood simulation results by parameter optimization compared with the karst flood simulated effects from the kl model the skl model presented a better performance in particular the peak flows simulated by the latter were close to the observed values while the kl model obviously overestimated the peak flow discharge against the observed values according to statistics the peak flows simulated by the skl and kl models were 6 and 22 larger than the observed values and the simulated flood volumes by these two models were 9 and 18 larger than the observations however the overall flow process simulated by these two models was basically consistent with the observed flow which indicated that the simplification of the kl model structure and parameters did not degrade its performance in contrast the simplified skl model had better flood simulation effects thus the algorithms for rainfall runoff generation in the skl model were effectively improved 4 2 model validation twenty two flood events in the study area were simulated by the kl model and skl model to validate the model improvement among them 8 flood simulation results are shown in fig 5 and the evaluation indices for all floods are listed in table 3 as shown in fig 5 the flood simulation results from the skl model were much better than those from the kl model the simulated peak flows based on the skl model were closer to the observed values than those based on the kl model however the overall flood processes that they simulated was in good agreement with the observed value table 3 shows the evaluation indices of the karst flood simulations by the two models compared with the indices for the kl model these indices for the skl model were significantly improved as follows the aic index decreased by 35 the smaller the aic value is the better the fit degree is the process relative error and the peak flow relative error decreased by 10 the water balance coefficient decreased by 0 25 the peak flow time error decreased by 2 h and the correlation coefficient increased by 0 05 the results in table 3 show that the flood simulation indices using the skl model were much better than those of the kl model indicating that the skl model worked much better in flood simulations after its structure and parameters were optimized from the kl model which was mainly caused by the improvement of the algorithm for runoff generation and confluence in the skl model indicating that the simplification and the improvement of the skl model in this study were feasible and effective 5 discussion 5 1 evaluation of simulated peak time differences from the model validation results in table 3 the average peak time error of the kl model was 3 h which means that the simulated peak flow arrived 3 h later than the observed value this lag time must be considered in flood forecasting to prepare for flood control in the study area the simulated peak delay occurred because of the rainfall runoff computing mechanism in the kl model for which runoff was generated only if the soil was saturated however in actual situations when rainfall exceeds the infiltration capacity a part of excess infiltration produces surface runoff on the exposed karst landforms in the basin and this surface runoff soon converges to the outlet section of the basin resulting in the early occurrence of actual peak flow the excess infiltration leading to surface runoff was not considered in the kl model eq 1 after the net rain compensates for the shortage of water in the vadose zone it slowly seeps down into the underground river system and eventually flows out of the underground river outlet thus causing the simulated peak flow delay in the kl model the peak time error of the skl model was 1 h indicating that the simulated peak discharge appeared 1 h later than the observed peak which is a smaller error than that of the kl model as both the surface runoff from excess infiltration on bare karst landforms and the runoff generation under the saturated buried karst zone were considered in the skl model the final confluence time was closer to the real situation the simulated peak time difference is an important metric for assessing the performance of hydrological models on the one hand it can reflect the systematic error of the model on the other hand this time difference can be used as the lead time of flood forecasting to a certain extent chen et al 2016 li et al 2019 for instance the average time difference of twenty two flood events in the study area was 3 h for the kl model and 1 h for the skl model the time difference of the simulation before and after the model improvement is negative overall indicating that the simulated flood peak flow occurred with a lag therefore we can take this lag time difference as a lead time reference in the actual flood forecast and deploy and control the flood in advance in this way the safe transfer of personnel and property before the arrival of the flood can avoid flood loss to a large extent 5 2 parameter uncertainty analysis the uncertainties in the input data model structure and parameters of hydrological models are often interwoven and determine the uncertainty in the final simulation results krzysztofowicz 2014 among them the uncertainty of the input data of the model can be controlled in this study the reliability consistency and representativeness of rainfall and flow data were reviewed and unreasonable data were eliminated to reduce their uncertainty in addition dem soil and land use data were also preprocessed especially dem data which should be identified because when dem is negative in karst areas it may be caused by data error or there may be real negative topography such as karst depressions sinkholes and skylights first these negative karst landforms were screened out through a basin survey then these real negative dem data were retained in the model sag filling calculation and only the depressions caused by dem data errors were calculated the above input data preprocessing can greatly reduce the uncertainty caused by the model input data the uncertainty of the hydrological model structure is relatively complex and difficult to control and reduce ju et al 2021 tyralis et al 2022 the current commonly used distributed hydrological models typically have multiple complex structures kraller et al 2014 eulogio et al 2018 for instance the vertical structure of the kl model is divided into six layers li et al 2019 the optimized skl model in this study included only the surface and underground two layer structures hence the uncertainty caused by the model structure was relatively low moreover the model structure and algorithm eqs 1 6 were improved in this study which can reduce the uncertainty caused by the model structure to its flood simulations this study evaluated the effects of the uncertainties of the model parameters on the model performance parameter uncertainty analysis in this study refers mainly to parameter sensitivity analysis this study focused on the analysis of parameter sensitivity before and after improvements were made to the kl model the multiple objective function values were calculated to assess the sensitivity of the various parameters in the two models as shown in table 4 and fig 6 according to the calculation results for parameter sensitivity in the kl and skl models in fig 6 and table 4 where the value of the multiple objective function was larger the parameter was more sensitive in the epikarst zone both models demonstrated highly sensitive parameters for the rock porosity rp specific yield sy and permeability coefficient k these findings showed that the aquifer interactions in the epikarst zone especially the karst water bearing media have a substantial influence on the simulation results for the model these findings also indicated that the influence of karst development in the epikarst zone on the rainfall runoff process is real and immediate and does not vary with the adopted hydrological models the results in fig 6 and table 4 show that for the rainfall infiltration coefficient ic for which the parameters were the same in the two models there were with different sensitivities which indicated that the phenomenon of same parameters with different effects persisted after the model was improved the infiltration coefficient in the skl model was the most sensitive parameter this parameter was a key factor in dividing the excess infiltration generating surface runoff and the underground runoff and it had the greatest impact on the floods simulated by the skl model the infiltration coefficient represents the soil water infiltration capacity and if the rainfall intensity is larger than the infiltration capacity excess infiltration may generate surface runoff in bare karst regions in fact in the flood season this situation is very common in the study area however the rainfall infiltration coefficient was an insensitive parameter in the kl model where runoff generation was not closely related to the soil infiltration capacity this contrast may have occurred because the kl model does not classify excess infiltration as surface runoff and infiltration runoff according to the relationship between rainfall intensity and infiltration capacity all rainfall in the kl model is treated as infiltration water while in the skl model it is divided into two components based on the relationship between rainfall intensity and infiltration capacity excess surface runoff and infiltration runoff if the rainfall intensity is greater than the infiltration capacity part of the water exceeding the infiltration capacity will form excess surface runoff and if the rainfall intensity is not greater than the infiltration capacity all the rainfall will infiltrate into the epikarst zone in fig 6 and table 4 the objective function f1 represents the influence of the nash sutcliffe coefficient on the simulated floods f3 is the influence of the water balance coefficient on the simulated floods and f2 reflects the influence of their combination on the simulation results in table 4 the objective function f1 f2 and f3 can represent the parameter uncertainty where the larger the value of the objective function is the more sensitive the parameter it can be noted that for any parameter including sensitive and insensitive ones its sensitivity when impacted by the objective function f1 was the highest followed by that under f2 and the parameter sensitivity under the action of objective function f3 was the lowest this result most likely occurred because the nash sutcliffe coefficient showed the performance of the model in the entire runoff process simulation which included both the simulated water volume of the runoff and the shape of the runoff graph the water balance coefficient mainly reflected the effect of the model on the total simulated water volume and compared with the water balance coefficient the nash sutcliffe coefficient was more sensitive to changes in the model parameters from the parameter sensitivity calculation results in fig 6 and table 4 the order of sensitivity of each parameter in the two models was determined for the kl model ac fc k sy sb rp sc h fd s0 ic n λ ep wc for the skl model ic k fc sy sb rp sc fd n s0 h λ 6 conclusions we effectively optimized the structure of the kl model and improved the algorithms for rainfall runoff to propose an skl model in this study compared with the kl model applied in karst regions the skl model had the advantage of requiring less data for modelling due to the optimized structure and parameter characteristics according to the results of this study the following conclusions can be obtained 1 the parameter optimization results showed that the improved cfpso algorithm was effective in parameter optimization this algorithm increased the activity of particle swarms and avoided the problem of local convergence 2 the phenomenon of same parameters with different effects in the kl and skl models indeed persisted the same parameter with different sensitivities in the two models was the rainfall infiltration coefficient in the skl model the rainfall infiltration coefficient was the most sensitive parameter but it was the least sensitive parameter in the kl model this contrast may have occurred because the kl model does not classify excess infiltration as surface runoff and infiltration runoff based on the relationship between rainfall intensity and infiltration capacity all rainfall in the kl model is treated as infiltration water 3 the simulation results of 22 karst flood events showed that the simulated floods based on the skl model were much better than those based on the kl model these changes indicated that the flood simulation performance of the skl model was enhanced after the structure and parameters were optimized which was mainly caused by the improvement in the algorithms for rainfall runoff indicating that the simplification and improvement for the kl model is effective and that the skl model is suitable for flood simulations in karst trough valley areas 4 in the kl model the structure and parameters are complex and many hydrogeological data are required for modelling in karst areas the skl model requires only a small amount of relevant data for modelling in karst regions and has high potential for application in karst flood simulation and forecasting the kl and skl models have been used to simulate floods in several karst areas the comparison results show that the kl model is suitable for flood simulation and prediction in the buried karst geomorphology of trough valley areas and if a karst basin has both buried karst landforms and bare karst landform units adopting the optimized skl model is more appropriate to verify the general applicability of the model we will extend this skl model to more karst areas not limited to karst trough valley areas in the future to provide the necessary technical support for karst flood

2825,the karst trough valley basin in zhongliang of chongqing is one of the most developed karst areas in southwest china with unique topographic features such as karst troughs and valleys that are prone to flash floods accurate simulation of flood processes in these areas using hydrological models can provide references for predicting future local runoff evolution trends the main challenge for hydrological modelling in karst areas lies in building a model with limited hydrogeological data in this study the karst liuxihe kl model was simplified and improved to simulate karst flood processes in the zhongliang karst trough valley the kl model consists of multiple complex structures a large amount of data is needed to model karst areas to overcome the modelling data requirements we modified the model structure and its parameters to propose a simplified kl skl model additionally we improved the runoff generation and confluence algorithms compared with the simulation results for 22 flood processes obtained by using the kl model the results for this skl model were better with less modelling data for example the mean value of the akaike information criterion aic index decreasing rate was 35 and the process relative error and the peak flow relative error decreased by 10 indicating that the technique of simplifying and improving the kl model is effective and that the simplified skl

valley areas vary greatly in time and space and are more anisotropic than those in nonkarst areas kurtulus and razack 2007 apollonio et al 2018 below the surface there are sinkholes shafts karst caves karst fissures and conduits crisscrossing the earth typically rainfall on the surface quickly flows through sinkholes or shafts into the underground river system and eventually exits through the karst river basin alberto and carmelo 2020 in the flood season heavy rains and floods frequently occur and the confluent flows to the outlets of the underground rivers reach high volumes in a short time often rapidly exceeding the discharge capacity yang et al 2020 overlimit floods occurring at the outlets of underground rivers cause flood related disasters there are many studies on flash flood simulation and forecasting in karst regions jourde et al 2013 demiroglu 2016 darras et al 2017 ravbar et al 2020 that can provide key technical means for regional flood control and mitigation kuriqi and hysa 2021 ilderomi et al 2022 bonacci et al 2006 described a flash flood in the dinaric karst region of croatia and its severe impact on the local karst area which suffered a vast loss especially from the economic aspect bailly et al 2012 used a conceptual semidistributed hydrological model to evaluate surface river karst groundwater interactions during flash floods in the mediterranean karst basin of the coulazou river fleury et al 2013 developed a conceptual hydrological model to study the karst aquifer response to rain events and to forecast dangerous karst flash flood events in the city of nimes southern france nannoni et al 2020 monitored an extreme storm in a complex alpine show karst cave the results confirmed that long term and well integrated monitoring can help in the simulation of karst flash floods in complex karst catchments this research on karst flood simulation and forecasting using hydrological models may provide key tools for regional flood mitigation pham 2021 however hydrological simulation and prediction in karst areas is much more difficult than that in nonkarst areas due to the influence of complex underlying surface runoff generation confluence characteristics and hydrogeological conditions in karst areas in addition the establishment of hydrological models in karst areas requires a large amount of hydrogeological data support which makes modelling extremely challenging this study takes the karst trough valley i e the zhongliang mountains watershed in southwest china as an example and attempts to establish a distributed hydrological model using less data than is demanded by the current commonly used karst groundwater numerical models such as the modflow cfp model that can effectively simulate karst flash flood events the research area is a trough valley in the zhongliang mountains a typical karst basin in chongqing china two trough valleys between the three hills of the trough and valley landscape provide favourable conditions for the formation and propagation of floods in recent years with the increase in the occurrence of extreme rainfall events and the unreasonable land development mode in the region flash floods have occurred frequently in the watershed causing serious economic losses wu et al 2018 therefore effective means should be adopted to accurately simulate karst flood disasters and quantitatively predict future flood evolution trends which can provide technical references for local non engineering flood control measures in this context hydrogeological models are useful tools the complex hydrogeological conditions and spatial variations that are characteristic of karst development in karst areas make it difficult to accurately quantify the water transport pattern in anisotropic karst aquifers with simple hydrological models ford and williams 2007 bailly et al 2012 a distributed model has potential in karst flood forecasting as it can divide the entire karst watershed into many karst subbasins eulogio et al 2018 thereby reflecting the characteristics of karst development and spatial differences in rainfall however distributed hydrological models usually have multiple structures and many parameters thus substantial hydrogeological data are usually needed to build models for karst areas kraller et al 2014 for example modflow cfp reimann and hill 2009 application in karst areas generally requires detailed information such as karst conduit distributions for which special borehole pumping experiments may be needed therefore the modelling cost is high li et al 2019 developed a distributed and physically based karst liuxihe kl model in the liujiang karst watershed in guangxi province china which has performed well in other karst regions li et al 2020 li et al 2021 however the application of the kl model in karst areas still has some shortcomings because the model structure and parameters are relatively complex for instance there are six layers of vertical structure in the kl model with fifteen parameters therefore the modelling data requirements are high for karst regions furthermore to obtain such data costly hydrogeological tests such as pumping tests may be needed to address the high demand for modelling data by the kl model we optimized the model structure and parameters improved the rainfall runoff algorithm and developed a simplified karst liuxihe skl model the simplifications are mainly reflected in the reduction of the model structure from six to four layers and the adjustment of parameters from fifteen to twelve the structure of the skl model is relatively simple and can be divided into just a surface and an underground double layer structure that requires limited hydrogeological data and information on karst aquifers the hydrogeological data for karst aquifers such as the distribution and direction of underground rivers can be deduced by tracer tests and no borehole pumping experiments are needed the main purpose of this study is to develop a physically based distributed hydrological model suitable for flood simulation and prediction in karst trough and valley basins which is achieved by simplifying the structure and parameters of the kl model and improving the algorithm of rainfall runoff generation and confluence in the skl model the relatively simple structures and parameters of this skl model require only a small amount of data for modelling in karst areas the reasonable flood simulation results show the potential and application value of the improved skl model in karst flood forecasting such as those found in the study area and provide a reasonable reference solution for local non engineering measures for flood prevention and mitigation moreover we seek to provide a theoretical reference for the use of limited data to build a distributed hydrological model in karst trough valley regions 2 study area and data 2 1 landforms and hydrogeological conditions the research area is the zhongliang mountains watershed in chongqing china which is located at 106 23 15 106 28 05 e and 29 40 30 29 48 10 n karst landforms are extremely well developed in this region the karst watershed has an area of 38 km2 and a humid subtropical monsoon climate and the average annual precipitation is approximately 1 082 6 mm the main types of land use are cultivated land forest grassland and karst waste land the main geological structure of the zhongliang mountains is the guanyinxia anticline where the exposed strata are mainly symmetrically distributed along the two limbs of the anticline to the core the strata in the anticlinal core are the lower triassic feixianguan formation t1f and gradually transition from the flanking strata into the lower series of the jialing river formation t1j the middle series of the leikoupo formation t2 l and the upper triassic xujiahe formation t3xj a fault the baimiaozi fault fig 1 b developed in the t1j formation on the western wing of the anticline which strikes roughly the same as the anticline axis carbonate rocks that are easily dissolved by karst water in the anticline core are surrounded by insoluble rock strata on both sides and there are two nne trending dissolution troughs in the east and west in the anticline core forming a pen rack topography of three mountains and two troughs fig 1b with an elevation of 480 640 m the first and third strata sections of t1f in the anticline core are karst aquifers where karst fissure systems and large karst underground conduits are densely distributed forming underground river systems the second and fourth sections are the t3xj and jurassic systems j which are water resistant layers that form the boundary of the underground river and block the underground hydraulic interaction between the anticlinal core and t1j and t2 l on both sides forming the following two relatively independent karst hydrogeological units the western karst trough valley t1j t2 l system and the eastern karst trough valley t1j t2 l system the fenghuang underground river is distributed in the eastern trough valley and flows into the jialing river at the outlet of the zhongliangshan karst basin fig 1a the northern and southern portions of the guanyinxia anticline are cut by the jialing river fig 1 and the yangtze river respectively the jialing river and yangtze river are surface nonkarst rivers the insoluble sandstone and mudstone are resistant to weathering and form ridges on the 2 limbs of the anticline fig 1b meanwhile karst water erodes the limestone and dolomite layers more easily than the sandstone and shale layers and this erosion has formed karst trough valleys which provide conditions conducive to flood propagation therefore the skl model was improved to effectively simulate karst flood processes which can provide technical support for local flood prevention and mitigation fig 1 shows the monitoring sites and their hypsometric curve land use and cross section of strata and the automatic gauging station in the basin the zhongliangshan watershed has both a buried karst landform and a large area with a bare karst landform distribution where the karst is well developed the surface of the karst trough valley is dominated by bare karst landforms while large karst conduits have developed underground forming an underground river system the underground river flow process line belongs to the response curve dominated by the karst conduit flow which shows the hydrological process dynamic characteristic line generally possessed by karst underground rivers in southwestern china rainfall is the main recharge water source of the fenghuang underground river fig 1a in the study area to determine the direction of the underground river and the regulation of rainfall infiltration water by karst water bearing media we conducted tracer tests and infiltration tests in the study area the results of the tracer test showed that the main body of the underground river system is a large karst conduit without obvious tributaries the closure condition of the underground watershed is good and there is no cross stream resupply water there are underground lakes in the underground river system these underground lakes can be considered reservoir units in the skl model their storage capacity was calculated using tracer material retention time and recovery the results of the infiltration test showed that the karstification depth during a flash flood is approximately 0 5 10 m underground where the epikarst zone plays a significant role in regulating and storing rainfall infiltration the karst fissure system can host many slow flow streams while fast flowing water quickly flows into the underground river through the wide conduit system the outlet flow of the fenghuang underground river responds very quickly to the rainfall process and the tracer test showed that the underground river can reach the flood peak flow after 6 7 h of rainfall the underground river outlet level rises and falls within the range of approximately 0 58 1 24 m during flooding in addition the results of rainstorm monitoring and infiltration tests in the study area showed that the karst groundwater level rise responds very quickly to rainfall while its recession process is relatively slow in response to rainfall the karst groundwater level rises rapidly in response to persistent heavy rainfall because rainfall is the main source of groundwater recharge in the region while its fall process is slow because many karst fissure water bearing systems are endowed with a large amount of infiltrated water during flash floods this water is slowly released into the underground river system after rainfall therefore the process of groundwater level recovery is long lasting and slow usually returning to its original position 5 7 days after rainfall occurs the typicality of the basin is mainly reflected in its landform of three mountains with two trough valleys this basin is an extension of the eastern sichuan parallel ridge valley landform it is a type of basin found throughout southwestern china especially in chongqing karst areas such as the qingmuguan karst basin and laolongdong karst basin in the nanshan district as well as this study area i e the zhongliangshan karst trough valley therefore the improved skl model in this study can also be applied to the flood simulation and forecasting of these karst areas in chongqing 2 2 modelling data the modelling data mainly refer to the digital elevation model dem land use and soil type data as well as rainfall observational data and flood events the free dem land use and soil data are downloaded from network databases and the initial resolutions are 30 30 m 1000 1000 m and 1000 1000 m respectively the links to download the data are provided in the data availability section of this article to create a model with these free data resampling is needed at a suitable spatial resolution determined by the size of the study area avand et al 2021 the study area is small i e only 38 km2 therefore to describe the karst characteristics and the hydrological processes of rainfall runoff in great detail the spatial resolution of the dem land use and soil type were resampled to 15 15 m based on the spatial discrete method by berry et al 2010 according to our previous modelling tests in this study area the river system extracted from the model at a spatial resolution of 15 m is basically consistent with the actual situation observed in google earth which is better than those at 30 m and 10 m or lower indicating that a resolution of 15 m for the dem land use and soil type is feasible twenty two karst flood events from 2018 to 2019 affecting the fenghuang underground river were selected to test the validity and applicability of the kl model and skl model in this study these karst flood processes consist mainly of rainfall in the basin and discharge from the underground river outlet the humid subtropical monsoon climate brings abundant rainfall to the basin for which the annual precipitation is approximately 1100 1300 mm however there are obvious differences in rainfall seasons with rainfall mainly concentrated in april october with most of the rainstorms occurring in june and july the precipitation is lowest in january the average monthly rainfall is less than 5 of the annual rainfall the recharge source of karst water resources in the underground river system basically comes from rainfall in the upper boundary and most of the precipitation collects in the depression at the trough bottom along the slope and replenishes the underground river system in the form of plane distributed infiltration through surface fissures and centralized injection through sinkholes therefore the underground river dynamics in the area belong to the rainfall source meteorological type and the corresponding curves of water level and flow at the outlet of the underground river with rainfall belong to obvious response curves dominated by conduit flow the water level and flow dynamics change synchronously with rainfall and are very sensitive to precipitation response showing the dynamic line characteristic of hydrological processes commonly found in karst underground rivers in southwest china the season for underground river flooding in the area is also consistent with the rainy season i e from april to october and underground river floods are frequent during the heavy rainfall season in june and july while the water level of underground rivers is extremely low in january and february and the rivers often become dry during this time an artificial open channel was built at the outlet of the underground river and an automatic gauging station fig 1d was installed to observe the water level in real time then the flow rate was calculated according to the equation with the water level and flow relationship in the triangular weir of the rectangular open channel 30 cm right isosceles triangle generally the time resolution for hydrological simulations is 1 h to further refine the simulations the time resolution was set to 15 min in this study fig 2 shows the dem and the soil types while the land use type is shown in fig 1a 3 methodology 3 1 the kl model li et al 2019 proposed the kl model as an improvement to the terrestrial liuxihe model the liuxihe model chen 2009 is a physically based distributed hydrological model that functions as a terrestrial hydrological model and is suitable for flood forecasting of surface rivers the model code is open source and free to use the model is relatively easy to build and all the modelling data are available at no cost on the internet which gives the liuxihe model great application potential the liuxihe model has been successfully applied to several watersheds including but not limited to reservoir inlet flood forecasting chen et al 2016 xing et al 2022 small and medium river flood forecasting chen 2018 li et al 2021 and flash flood early warning forecasting macalalad et al 2021 to make the liuxihe model applicable to karst areas li et al 2019 improved the model structure and algorithm of runoff generation and confluence to develop the kl model the application effects in many karst areas show that this improved kl model is suitable for karst flood simulation and prediction li et al 2020 li et al 2021 however the structure of the kl model is quite complex in particular the vertical structure of the model is divided into six layers moreover fifteen parameters need to be optimized resulting in a great demand for modelling data in karst areas and a high modelling cost for example to obtain the rock porosity and permeability coefficient a borehole pumping test is needed 3 2 the skl model to address the difficulty of high demand for modelling data of the kl model in karst areas we propose the simplified skl model based on the kl model where the simplifications are mainly accomplished through the use of the following two processes simplifying the structure and parameters of the kl model and improving the runoff generation and confluence algorithms to develop the skl model therefore the main difference between these two models is also reflected in two aspects first the structures and parameters of the two models are quantitatively different there are six vertical structures and fifteen parameters in the kl model while there are four vertical structures with twelve parameters in the skl model therefore compared with the kl model which has a more complex structure and parameters the simplified skl model has a relatively simple structure and the amount of hydrogeological data required for modelling is greatly reduced second the runoff generation and confluence algorithms are improved in the skl model to ensure that the performance of the model does not deteriorate after its structure and parameters are optimized generally after the structure and parameters of the hydrological model are simplified its performance may be reduced to a certain extent in terms of mechanism that is the effects of flood simulation and prediction become worse and at the same time the uncertainty of flood prediction of the simplified model becomes larger therefore we enhance the optimized skl model mainly by advancing its rainfall runoff algorithm reflected in the algorithm optimization of runoff yield and confluence and refining the parameter calibration method these actions improve the performance of the skl model and reduce its uncertainty in karst flood simulation and forecasting in the performance test of the model the simplification effect and accuracy of the model are evaluated by comparing the simulation results of karst floods between the two models the difference between the two models mainly represented by our simplification of the kl model is as follows 1 simplifying the model structure and parameters the kl model which has a relatively complex structure contains the following six vertical structures vegetation cover ground layer soil layer rock layer in the epikarst zone underground river system and deep karst zone we redesigned its vertical structure according to the characteristics of underground runoff generation and confluence the spatial structure of the skl model is reduced from six to the following four layers the vegetation cover soil layer rock stratum and underground river system both models have the same horizontal structure that is they both contain the following three horizontal structures river channel cells slope cells and reservoir cells the simplified vertical model structure can be represented by the subsurface vertical structure of karst hydrological response units khrus in the kl model the entire karst watershed is divided into many karst subbasins within the dem li et al 2019 the selected karst subbasin units are the smallest computation unit in the model this division method is feasible for flood forecasting in large karst watersheds li et al 2020 however the division of karst subbasin units is too rough for very small karst watersheds such as the research area in this study i e the zhongliang mountains watershed which has an area of 38 km2 considering that dem data with a spatial resolution of 15 15 m were used to divide the karst subbasin units in this study it is possible to delineate only a small number of karst subbasins for a small karst basin such as the one in the study area hence the differences in karst development of the underlying basin surface cannot be fully reflected thus the law of runoff generation and confluence cannot be accurately depicted to describe the underlying surface of karst watersheds in more detail recognize different karst water bearing media and depict the water movement within these media using the skl model these karst subbasins are further divided into a series of khrus by combining arcgis 10 2 software with the skl model the kl model comprises only karst subbasins and has no khrus while the skl model comprises the divided khrus karst subbasins the procedures for defining and calculating these khrus follow the case studies of hydrological response units hrus in the topmodel by pan 2014 and in the swat model by ren 2006 after the khrus are divided all of the hydrological processes within them such as rainfall interpolation and runoff generation and confluence as well as parametric optimization are calculated the khrus are small enough to ignore the spatial differences in the underlying surface conditions of the karst basin allowing the maximum use of limited hydrogeological data to build the skl model in the vertical subsurface structure of these khrus in the skl model there are four layers as follows vegetation cover epikarst zone including the soil layer and shallow karst fissure and conduit systems rock strata and underground river system compared with the six vertical structures in the kl model there are fewer modelling data requirements for the skl model in addition compared with the rough karst subbasin units divided in the kl model the divided khrus in the skl model can better describe the underlying karst surface allowing for the recognition of different karst water bearing media and the effective calculation of the underground water movement within them fig 3 shows the structural diagram of the khrus which can reflect the spatial structure of karst aquifers once the model structure has been adjusted the parameters need to be optimized accordingly the parameters are simplified from fifteen in the kl model to twelve in the skl model the three parameters omitted from the skl model are the potential evaporation rate wilting coefficient and attenuation coefficient of the underground runoff table 1 shows the parameters in the kl model 2 improved runoff generation and confluence algorithms to ensure that the model performance is not diminished after the model structure and parameters are simplified we make specific improvements to the algorithms for runoff generation and confluence to improve the model accuracy the kl model does not include algorithms for the excess infiltration runoff generation in the exposed karst landforms as it assumes that all rainfall will infiltrate the karst aquifer system hence only the runoff generation under the saturated buried karst zone is calculated however when the net rainfall the amount of rainfall after vegetation interception and evaporation reaches the exposed karst landforms excess surface infiltration runoff may be generated in the khrus this excess runoff is considered in the skl model which was calculated as follows 1 r si 0 p i i f r si p i f i p i i f i f b f c f s δ f f where rsi is the depth of the excess infiltration of surface runoff mm pi is the rainfall after the removal of water loss from vegetation interception and evaporation mm if is the infiltration capacity of the epikarst zone mm fi is the water seepage in the surface karst zone mm b and δ are constants that can be determined by the infiltration test and fc fs and ff are the field capacity actual soil moisture and water volume of steady seepage mm respectively the kl model assumes that all the infiltrated rainfall will enter the underground river directly and does not consider confluence calculations in the soil interflow while in the skl model we subdivide the infiltrated runoff generation into the following two components the interflow in the soil layer and the runoff in the underground river these components are described as follows chen 2018 2 q rih v rih w z q rih x w z s t q ri q riv q riv q r i v 0 exp a t b 3 v rih k tan α f s f c v rih 0 f s f c where q rih and v rih are the interflow into the soil layer l s 1 and

vertical soil layer l s 1 a and b are constants determined by the infiltration test k is the permeability coefficient in the epikarst zone m s 1 and α is the hydraulic gradient of the interflow the rainfall infiltration water movement in the epikarst zone is divided into rapid flow and slow flow rapid flow occurs in macrofractures such as karst conduits sinkholes or underground river systems the water regulation of the rapid flow for rainfall infiltration is ignored due to its weak storage functions slow flow refers to water movement through tiny karst fissures which plays an important role in regulating and storing rainfall infiltration water the slow fissure flow in the epikarst zone is described as follows ren 2006 li et al 2019 4 sw q ind q crk w t 1 w t s w t 1 w inf t 1 w inf w 1 exp δ t t t ac t t ac θ sat θ fc k where sw and sw t 1 are the slow flow in the tiny karst fissures at time t and t 1 respectively l s 1 qinf is the rainfall infiltration water in the epikarst zone l

the underground river at time t and t 1 respectively l s 1 δt is the calculated time step hours ttac is the attenuation coefficient of underground runoff θ sat is the saturation water content in the epikarst zone θ fc is the field capacity and k is the saturated hydraulic conductivity the muskingum model which is usually applied to the flood confluence of surface rivers dooge et al 1982 li et al 2019 is used in the kl model to calculate the confluence of the underground river during floods karst underground rivers are usually under pressure and saturated rainfall moisture infiltrating the underground river system can exhibit laminar or turbulent flow depending on the flow pattern at the time in the skl model the main confluent conduit of the underground river system is generalized into multiple sections connected by approximately circular pipelines in which the hagen poiseuille and darcy weisbach equations are employed to describe the confluence processes as follows valiantzas 2008

et al 2016 the basic pso algorithm can easily lead to local convergence with weak particle activity in the skl model the chaos factor pso cfpso algorithm is adopted to optimize its parameters where several cycles of chaotic disturbances are increased in the algorithm to improve its activity the inverse mapping equation for chaotic variables is as follows 7 x ij x min x max x min z ij z ij 1 c z c z ij where xij is the optimization variable xmin and xmax are its minimum and maximum respectively zij and z ij are the chaotic variables before and after the disturbances are added respectively z is the chaotic variable formed when the optimal particle maps to the interval 0 1 and c is determined by the adaptive method where it determines the strength of the disturbance that is added 0 c 1 3 4 methods of uncertainty analysis the uncertainty analysis of model simulation results is very important for distributed hydrological models the uncertainties in the model input parameters and model structure determine the uncertainty of the final model performance krzysztofowicz 2014 for the kl model only the parameter sensitivity is analysed while for the skl model the rainfall input model structure and parameter uncertainties are evaluated in detail in the skl model a multiparameter sensitivity analysis mpsa algorithm choi et al 1999 is adopted to calculate the parameter sensitivities for which the nash sutcliffe coefficient and the water balance coefficient are selected to form a multiple objective function the former represents the degree of coincidence between the simulated flow of the floods and the observed values while the latter reflects the difference between the simulated and observed total water amounts the combination of the two coefficients can basically reflect the effects of the model on karst flood simulations liu et al 2019 the multiple objective functions are as follows 8 c 1 i 1 n q i q i 2 i 1 n q i q 2 w i 1 n q i i 1 n q i i 1 n q i where c is the nash sutcliffe coefficient dimensionless qi and q i are the observed and simulated values of the peak discharges respectively l s 1 q is the average observed value of the peak discharge l s 1 n is the observed period and w is the value of the water balance coefficient the multiple objective function is defined as f i ω 1 1 c ω 2 1 w i 1 2 3 and the weight coefficients ω 1 and ω 2 are listed in table 2 3 5 model setup the model setup mainly refers to the preprocessing of basic modelling data and some initial condition settings before model calibration and running in the study area the watershed is divided into 168 889 khrus using 15 15 m dem data in the skl model which includes 14 550 surface river cells 128 520 hill slope cells and 25 819 underground river cells among which there are 1080 underground reservoir cells after the model framework is built a series of initial conditions is needed to determine the hydrological simulation 1 the initial range of soil water content is set to 30 90 of saturated water content which is based on the 22 flood simulation tests by the models in the study area during floods the soil water content before each flood is different and needs to be determined by a series of model run tests the initial state of the underground river is automatically monitored in real time by setting up an artificial gauging station at its outlet the river base flow is approximately 35 l s 1 based on the multiyear average dry season runoff in the basin 2 the groundwater divide can be determined based on the preliminary analysis of the stratigraphic structure and flow field in the study area the waterhead boundary conditions of the model are determined where a stable water level near the groundwater divide is selected as the boundary of the fixed waterhead 3 the initial values of the parameters are determined based on their physical characteristics to optimize the model parameters 4 dem soil type and land use data as well as rainfall and flow data are adopted to simulate the flood processes based on the kl and skl models the performance of the simplified and improved model is tested in this study the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 correlation coefficient process relative error peak flow relative error water balance coefficient and peak time error are used to evaluate the performance of the models in flood simulations the smaller the aic value is the better the fit degree is indicating that the model works better the aic index can be calculated as follows 9 ai c 1 n ln 1 n i 1 n q i q i 2 n 2 p a i c 2 m ln 1 m i 1 m q i q i 2 m 2 p a i c 1 ai c 1 d a i c 2 where the aic index consists of the parameter calibration period aic 1 and model validation period aic 2 values qi and q i are the observed and simulated values of the peak discharges respectively l s 1 n and m are the sample numbers in the calibration and validation periods p is the number of model parameters which are different in the two models fifteen in the kl model and twelve in the skl model and d is the pondage factor which can be obtained by model trial calculation 4 results 4 1 results of parametric optimization a total of twenty two karst flood events were collected for this study among them the input data including the first three consecutive flood events in the calibration period were used to optimize the model parameters and the remaining data of the validated datasets were used to evaluate the performances of the kl and skl models in this study fig 4 shows the karst flood simulation results by parameter optimization compared with the karst flood simulated effects from the kl model the skl model presented a better performance in particular the peak flows simulated by the latter were close to the observed values while the kl model obviously overestimated the peak flow discharge against the observed values according to statistics the peak flows simulated by the skl and kl models were 6 and 22 larger than the observed values and the simulated flood volumes by these two models were 9 and 18 larger than the observations however the overall flow process simulated by these two models was basically consistent with the observed flow which indicated that the simplification of the kl model structure and parameters did not degrade its performance in contrast the simplified skl model had better flood simulation effects thus the algorithms for rainfall runoff generation in the skl model were effectively improved 4 2 model validation twenty two flood events in the study area were simulated by the kl model and skl model to validate the model improvement among them 8 flood simulation results are shown in fig 5 and the evaluation indices for all floods are listed in table 3 as shown in fig 5 the flood simulation results from the skl model were much better than those from the kl model the simulated peak flows based on the skl model were closer to the observed values than those based on the kl model however the overall flood processes that they simulated was in good agreement with the observed value table 3 shows the evaluation indices of the karst flood simulations by the two models compared with the indices for the kl model these indices for the skl model were significantly improved as follows the aic index decreased by 35 the smaller the aic value is the better the fit degree is the process relative error and the peak flow relative error decreased by 10 the water balance coefficient decreased by 0 25 the peak flow time error decreased by 2 h and the correlation coefficient increased by 0 05 the results in table 3 show that the flood simulation indices using the skl model were much better than those of the kl model indicating that the skl model worked much better in flood simulations after its structure and parameters were optimized from the kl model which was mainly caused by the improvement of the algorithm for runoff generation and confluence in the skl model indicating that the simplification and the improvement of the skl model in this study were feasible and effective 5 discussion 5 1 evaluation of simulated peak time differences from the model validation results in table 3 the average peak time error of the kl model was 3 h which means that the simulated peak flow arrived 3 h later than the observed value this lag time must be considered in flood forecasting to prepare for flood control in the study area the simulated peak delay occurred because of the rainfall runoff computing mechanism in the kl model for which runoff was generated only if the soil was saturated however in actual situations when rainfall exceeds the infiltration capacity a part of excess infiltration produces surface runoff on the exposed karst landforms in the basin and this surface runoff soon converges to the outlet section of the basin resulting in the early occurrence of actual peak flow the excess infiltration leading to surface runoff was not considered in the kl model eq 1 after the net rain compensates for the shortage of water in the vadose zone it slowly seeps down into the underground river system and eventually flows out of the underground river outlet thus causing the simulated peak flow delay in the kl model the peak time error of the skl model was 1 h indicating that the simulated peak discharge appeared 1 h later than the observed peak which is a smaller error than that of the kl model as both the surface runoff from excess infiltration on bare karst landforms and the runoff generation under the saturated buried karst zone were considered in the skl model the final confluence time was closer to the real situation the simulated peak time difference is an important metric for assessing the performance of hydrological models on the one hand it can reflect the systematic error of the model on the other hand this time difference can be used as the lead time of flood forecasting to a certain extent chen et al 2016 li et al 2019 for instance the average time difference of twenty two flood events in the study area was 3 h for the kl model and 1 h for the skl model the time difference of the simulation before and after the model improvement is negative overall indicating that the simulated flood peak flow occurred with a lag therefore we can take this lag time difference as a lead time reference in the actual flood forecast and deploy and control the flood in advance in this way the safe transfer of personnel and property before the arrival of the flood can avoid flood loss to a large extent 5 2 parameter uncertainty analysis the uncertainties in the input data model structure and parameters of hydrological models are often interwoven and determine the uncertainty in the final simulation results krzysztofowicz 2014 among them the uncertainty of the input data of the model can be controlled in this study the reliability consistency and representativeness of rainfall and flow data were reviewed and unreasonable data were eliminated to reduce their uncertainty in addition dem soil and land use data were also preprocessed especially dem data which should be identified because when dem is negative in karst areas it may be caused by data error or there may be real negative topography such as karst depressions sinkholes and skylights first these negative karst landforms were screened out through a basin survey then these real negative dem data were retained in the model sag filling calculation and only the depressions caused by dem data errors were calculated the above input data preprocessing can greatly reduce the uncertainty caused by the model input data the uncertainty of the hydrological model structure is relatively complex and difficult to control and reduce ju et al 2021 tyralis et al 2022 the current commonly used distributed hydrological models typically have multiple complex structures kraller et al 2014 eulogio et al 2018 for instance the vertical structure of the kl model is divided into six layers li et al 2019 the optimized skl model in this study included only the surface and underground two layer structures hence the uncertainty caused by the model structure was relatively low moreover the model structure and algorithm eqs 1 6 were improved in this study which can reduce the uncertainty caused by the model structure to its flood simulations this study evaluated the effects of the uncertainties of the model parameters on the model performance parameter uncertainty analysis in this study refers mainly to parameter sensitivity analysis this study focused on the analysis of parameter sensitivity before and after improvements were made to the kl model the multiple objective function values were calculated to assess the sensitivity of the various parameters in the two models as shown in table 4 and fig 6 according to the calculation results for parameter sensitivity in the kl and skl models in fig 6 and table 4 where the value of the multiple objective function was larger the parameter was more sensitive in the epikarst zone both models demonstrated highly sensitive parameters for the rock porosity rp specific yield sy and permeability coefficient k these findings showed that the aquifer interactions in the epikarst zone especially the karst water bearing media have a substantial influence on the simulation results for the model these findings also indicated that the influence of karst development in the epikarst zone on the rainfall runoff process is real and immediate and does not vary with the adopted hydrological models the results in fig 6 and table 4 show that for the rainfall infiltration coefficient ic for which the parameters were the same in the two models there were with different sensitivities which indicated that the phenomenon of same parameters with different effects persisted after the model was improved the infiltration coefficient in the skl model was the most sensitive parameter this parameter was a key factor in dividing the excess infiltration generating surface runoff and the underground runoff and it had the greatest impact on the floods simulated by the skl model the infiltration coefficient represents the soil water infiltration capacity and if the rainfall intensity is larger than the infiltration capacity excess infiltration may generate surface runoff in bare karst regions in fact in the flood season this situation is very common in the study area however the rainfall infiltration coefficient was an insensitive parameter in the kl model where runoff generation was not closely related to the soil infiltration capacity this contrast may have occurred because the kl model does not classify excess infiltration as surface runoff and infiltration runoff according to the relationship between rainfall intensity and infiltration capacity all rainfall in the kl model is treated as infiltration water while in the skl model it is divided into two components based on the relationship between rainfall intensity and infiltration capacity excess surface runoff and infiltration runoff if the rainfall intensity is greater than the infiltration capacity part of the water exceeding the infiltration capacity will form excess surface runoff and if the rainfall intensity is not greater than the infiltration capacity all the rainfall will infiltrate into the epikarst zone in fig 6 and table 4 the objective function f1 represents the influence of the nash sutcliffe coefficient on the simulated floods f3 is the influence of the water balance coefficient on the simulated floods and f2 reflects the influence of their combination on the simulation results in table 4 the objective function f1 f2 and f3 can represent the parameter uncertainty where the larger the value of the objective function is the more sensitive the parameter it can be noted that for any parameter including sensitive and insensitive ones its sensitivity when impacted by the objective function f1 was the highest followed by that under f2 and the parameter sensitivity under the action of objective function f3 was the lowest this result most likely occurred because the nash sutcliffe coefficient showed the performance of the model in the entire runoff process simulation which included both the simulated water volume of the runoff and the shape of the runoff graph the water balance coefficient mainly reflected the effect of the model on the total simulated water volume and compared with the water balance coefficient the nash sutcliffe coefficient was more sensitive to changes in the model parameters from the parameter sensitivity calculation results in fig 6 and table 4 the order of sensitivity of each parameter in the two models was determined for the kl model ac fc k sy sb rp sc h fd s0 ic n λ ep wc for the skl model ic k fc sy sb rp sc fd n s0 h λ 6 conclusions we effectively optimized the structure of the kl model and improved the algorithms for rainfall runoff to propose an skl model in this study compared with the kl model applied in karst regions the skl model had the advantage of requiring less data for modelling due to the optimized structure and parameter characteristics according to the results of this study the following conclusions can be obtained 1 the parameter optimization results showed that the improved cfpso algorithm was effective in parameter optimization this algorithm increased the activity of particle swarms and avoided the problem of local convergence 2 the phenomenon of same parameters with different effects in the kl and skl models indeed persisted the same parameter with different sensitivities in the two models was the rainfall infiltration coefficient in the skl model the rainfall infiltration coefficient was the most sensitive parameter but it was the least sensitive parameter in the kl model this contrast may have occurred because the kl model does not classify excess infiltration as surface runoff and infiltration runoff based on the relationship between rainfall intensity and infiltration capacity all rainfall in the kl model is treated as infiltration water 3 the simulation results of 22 karst flood events showed that the simulated floods based on the skl model were much better than those based on the kl model these changes indicated that the flood simulation performance of the skl model was enhanced after the structure and parameters were optimized which was mainly caused by the improvement in the algorithms for rainfall runoff indicating that the simplification and improvement for the kl model is effective and that the skl model is suitable for flood simulations in karst trough valley areas 4 in the kl model the structure and parameters are complex and many hydrogeological data are required for modelling in karst areas the skl model requires only a small amount of relevant data for modelling in karst regions and has high potential for application in karst flood simulation and forecasting the kl and skl models have been used to simulate floods in several karst areas the comparison results show that the kl model is suitable for flood simulation and prediction in the buried karst geomorphology of trough valley areas and if a karst basin has both buried karst landforms and bare karst landform units adopting the optimized skl model is more appropriate to verify the general applicability of the model we will extend this skl model to more karst areas not limited to karst trough valley areas in the future to provide the necessary technical support for karst flood

2 1 study area the loess plateau is situated in the upper and middle reaches of the yellow river basin in northern china covering an area of 632 520 km2 and accounting for 6 3 of the entire land area of china fig 1 this region includes the whole or part of seven provinces qinghai gansu ningxia inner mongolia shaanxi henan and shanxi the average annual precipitation ranges from 200 mm in the northwest to 750 mm in the southeast with 60 70 of the rainfall occurring during summer in the form of heavy storms sun et al 2015 the mean annual air temperature is 4 in the northwest and 14 in the southeast peng et al 2018 therefore this region is a typical dryland with an arid semi arid and semi humid transitional climate the major land cover types are grasslands and croplands followed by forests bare land and urban areas fig 1b after many ecological restoration programs especially the grain for green project had been carried out bryan et al 2018 the areal coverage of grasslands and forests increased from 310 000 and 155 000 km2 in 2001 to 370 000 and 185 000 km2 in 2010 respectively and correspondingly the area of barren land and shrublands showed decreasing trends fan et al 2015 to detect the spatial variability of the vegetation greening effect we divided the loess plateau into five subregions according to ecological restoration and geographic features yang et al 2019 i

by loess hill and gully terrains the elp and wlp feature rocky mountains and loess sorghum gullies respectively the slp mainly river fault depression valleys is an economically developed area with a higher level of urbanization 2 2 data availability the vic model required various input data including meteorological forcing soil parameters vegetation parameters land cover type and topography the

lai product v5 was retrieved from the modis reflectance data using the general regression neural networks algorithm xiao et al 2014 and it was updated using a deep learning model ma and liang 2022 the glass fvc product was also obtained by using the general regression neural networks algorithm based on landsat tm etm and modis reflectance data jia et al 2015 to adapt to simulations with the vic model the 8 day composite lai and fvc data were linearly interpolated to a daily resolution to evaluate the model performance for et and its components several types of data including ground based observations water balance derived estimates and remote sensing retrievals were implemented we collected ground based daily et observations from three covariance flux towers fig 1a and table 1 of the coordinated enhanced observation project in arid and semi arid regions in northern china the et component data from field experiments were also obtained to validate ec et and es and these data have been successfully used to detect the water consumption from vegetation and bare soil as evidenced in the literature listed in table 2 please note the measurements of et ec et and es located different sites and their data were at different time scales i e daily scales for et and monthly scales for the three components the ground based observations of total et and its components only represent small scale evaporation flux 1 km2 therefore we derived annual water balance based et estimates i e et p q δs where p is the annual precipitation q is the annual runoff and δs is the change of total water storage the annual runoff was calculated based on monthly streamflow data of eight catchments on the loess plateau fig 1a which were obtained from the annual hydrological report for china the change of total water storage δs of each catchment was derived from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace with respect to the average of three solutions i e csr https www2 csr utexas edu grace gsfc https earth gsfc nasa gov geo and jpl mascon https grace jpl nasa gov moreover we collected two remote sensing et products from global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 and penman monteith leuning pml zhang et al 2019b zhang et al 2016b both the gleam and pml products used lai to represent vegetation dynamics and simply considered water balance gleam et was at 0 25 and daily resolution and pml et was at 0 05 and 8 day resolution both of which were interpolated to 0 0625 and daily resolution in this study to relieve their uncertainties we averaged the two products to obtain a more reliable et estimation which was referred to as remote sensing et in this study 2 3 hydrological model for et partitioning the variable infiltration capacity vic model was adopted to estimate et components and to detect their drivers on the loess plateau the vic model an extensively used macroscale hydrological model liang et al 1994 liang et al 1996 is able to solve the problems of water and energy balance with vegetation soil and atmosphere haddeland et al 2006 nijssen et al 2001 painter et al 2010 it is a grid based model that can be implemented at different spatial from 0 0625 to 2 latitude by longitude and temporal resolutions from hourly to daily for land cover variability each grid cell is partitioned into multiple vegetation types and bare soil and the soil column is typically divided into three or more layers so the model considers root distribution in multiple layers but it fails to represent growth with root dynamics however it can incorporate remote sensing products e g lai and fvc to partly remedy this issue hydrological states and variables such as infiltration surface runoff subsurface runoff evapotranspiration et land surface temperature and energy flux are calculated at the subgrid scale and finally aggregated to the grid scale we briefly describe the formulation of the et and its components here the vic model partitions et into four components soil evaporation es vegetation transpiration et canopy interception loss ec and snow sublimation esn the total et over a grid cell is computed as the sum of the above components weighted by their respective surface cover area fractions which is 1 et n 1 n c n e c n e t n c n 1 e s e sn where cn is the fractional vegetation coverage fvc for the nth vegetation title which is often regarded as a constant in the study period but a dynamic fvc can better represent vegetation growth providing more accurate et simulations cn 1 is the soil fraction and n 1 n 1 c n 1 vegetation transpiration canopy interception loss and soil evaporation are all developed by constraining the potential evapotranspiration from the penman monteith formulation shuttleworth 1993 which sets the bulk surface resistant as zero to be simplified to the penman formulation for potential et computation in this model 2 e p δ r n g ρ a c p d r a λ δ γ where ep is the potential

photosynthetically active radiation flux par factor respectively gsm is a soil moisture stress factor that depends on the soil moisture content and lai is the leaf area index m2 m 2 which is usually a static interannually invariant index in most studies but dynamic lai is used to reflect the interannual change in vegetation in this study soil evaporation only occurs for the area without vegetation coverage i e bare land on the top thin layer when the surface soil is saturated it evaporates at the potential evaporation rate otherwise its evaporation varies according to the heterogeneities in infiltration topography and soil characteristics soil evaporation is described as 6 e s e p 0 a s da a s 1 i 0 i m 1 1 a 1 b i d a where es is the soil evaporation mm im is the maximum infiltration

soil that is saturated and i0 represents the corresponding point infiltration capacity so es is dependent on soil moisture condition snow sublimation is calculated directly from a modified energy balance energy exchange between atmosphere forest canopy and snowpack occurs only within the surface layer for specific calculations of the snow sublimation and the parameters and variables described above please refer to the original vic papers liang et al 1994 from the above description we can see that the vic model features prominently in the computation of the et components by considering energy balance and establishing water constraints so that the interaction between soil moisture dynamics and et processes are well formulated this feature makes it more suitable for et estimation than remote sensing based et algorithms in water limited conditions which generally only employ energy balance to constrain e g the priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl model fisher et al 2008 as expressed in the above equations the vic model also applies vegetation structure i e lai for each land use type and coverage i e fvc to reflect the impact of land cover on et however the original version of the vic generally employs static lai and fvc with climatological conditions which is able to represent seasonal variability rather than interannual dynamics to remedy this issue this study applied daily lai and fvc from the glass products to force the vic simulations and this application has been demonstrated to be effective in hydrological simulations due to the representation of vegetation dynamics jiang et al 2021 meng et al 2020 2 4 simulation experimental design we designed one baseline and three detrended scenarios i e p det v det and ra det table 3 to quantify the hydrological effects of precipitation change vegetation greening and radiation change respectively on the loess plateau for 2000 2018 the four were run at spatial temporal resolutions of 0 0625 and 3 h to achieve water and energy balances the difference in et and its components between the baseline scenario and the different detrended scenario is assumed to represent the contributions of precipitation change vegetation greening or radiation change for the baseline scenario the model was run using the original forcing data including dynamic vegetation coverage and radiation forcing for the p det scenario the trend of precipitation was linearly removed and the other forcing variables remained the same as those in the baseline scenario similarly with respect to the ra det scenario the downward longwave and shortwave radiation data were linearly detrended the detrended method used in the p det and ra det simulation schemes is as follows 7 v y i d v y i a y b y i v y i v y i d whereyi is a year within 2000 2018 v y i d is the detrended daily precipitation shortwave radiation or longwave radiation on day d in the year yi v y i d is the original daily precipitation shortwave radiation or longwave radiation v y i is the annual daily precipitation shortwave radiation or longwave radiation in the year yi yb is the reference year 2000 and a is the linear trend of annual precipitation shortwave radiation or longwave radiation the detrended time series v y i d maintains the seasonal variations but has no interannual trend for the v det scenario the daily mean values of lai fvc and albedo during 2000 2002 were used to drive the vic model for the period 2000 2018 this strategy not only removes the variation trend but also avoids abrupt land cover changes in a given year while there are many factors influencing land surface albedo e g vegetation coverage soil moisture and snow coverage land use and land cover are generally assumed as the primary factors therefore this study takes the effect of albedo on et as one of the vegetation contributors although it is connected to radiation balance 3 results 3 1 model evaluation 3 1 1 ground based evaluation the metrics of root mean square error rmse pearson correlation coefficient r and the relative bias bias were used to examine the robustness of the vic model we first compared simulations with ground based observations fig 2 shows the simulated et against observed et at three towers on a daily basis the simulated et is consistent with the observations as the r is up to 0 68 and the relative bias ranges from 35 4 to 2 7 the model also presents acceptable performance for transpiration et canopy interception loss ec and soil evaporation es simulations the r for et is more than 0 45 with the relative bias 24 8 fig 3 similar levels of the three metrics are obtained for ec and es while the numbers of their observation points are relatively small fig 4 the vic model was further evaluated based on the catchment scale runoff and the associated water balance derived et we used another metric i e the kling gupta efficiency index kge gupta et al 2009 instead of rmse to detect the runoff simulation performance as it is more robust and widely used in streamflow evaluation althoff and rodrigues 2021 as shown in table 4 the model can reasonably simulate the monthly runoff for the eight catchments with kge more than 0 31 and bias 33 93 the simulations generally capture the peak flow and baseflow well at most stations although relatively poor performance occurs when tracing the peak flow at linjiaping and gaoshiya stations fig 5 for the water balance derived et the model achieves r of 0 69 and bias of 5 2 fig 5i although the model seems to slightly underestimate et and the components to some degree the overall performance is acceptable to match the ground based observations 3 1 2 remote sensing based comparison in addition to the ground based evaluation we employed gleam and pml products both of which simply incorporated water constraints by solving the water balance equation with precipitation as input in the et estimation fig 6 compares the simulated et with remote sensing et i e the average between gleam et and pml et in the growing season may october during the period 2003 2018 since the pml product has a large amount of missing data for the first three years of 2000 2002 the spatial pattern of the simulated et is in agreement with that of the remote sensing estimation displaying lower values in the northwest and higher values in the southeast fig 6a and b and with bias ranging between 40 and 20 fig 6c the simulated interannual et variability also closely follows that of the remote sensing et with r of 0 91 and bias of 3 40 fig 6d to further confirm our simulations et and its components et ec and es of our study were compared with those of gleam and pml for the growing season during 2003 2018 we focused the inter annual variations of the four variables which was important to reflect the change trends of the four thus we computed their time series anomalies by removing their long term means the trends of the four components from the three estimations are consistent et et and ec increase but es decreases in this period despite slight differences between the vic simulation and the other two products fig 7 this consistency also indicates the reliability of the estimations of the et components 3 2 spatial distribution the spatial distribution of the mean annual et and the ratio of each et component are shown in fig 8 the mean annual et over the entire region is about 390 mm but large spatial heterogeneity can be seen in the study area with lower values 200 mm in the northwestern part and higher values greater than 500 mm in the southeastern part fig 8a this spatial pattern is consistent with the distribution of precipitation averaged over the whole region es accounts for the largest proportion of et about 60 followed by et ec and esn fig 8b which indicates that soil evaporation consumes more water than vegetation transpiration however the ratios of the four components to the total et present contrasting spatial distributions fig 8c f in the nlp and northern part of the wlp et primarily comes from es with es et above 75 because the land cover type is mainly desert and these areas are under a dry climate in contrast in the elp and eastern part of the wlp and mlp et is the main contributor with et et greater than 50 and ec et is also as high as 15 because the land cover in these areas is dominated by forest and grassland in terms of esn it occupies only a little portion of et below 6 except for a small area in the western part of the wlp whose elevation is more than 4000 m 3 3 temporal changes to detect the difference of the changes in et and its components so as to identify which one is the largest contributor to the total et interannual variations are depicted in fig 9 a the average annual et on the loess plateau exhibits a significantly increasing trend of 5 73 mm yr 1 totalling 108 87 mm during 2000 2018 which results from the significant positive trends in et 4 76 mm yr 1 p 0 01 and ec 0 91 mm yr 1 p 0 01 while the trends of es 0 09 mm yr 1 and esn 0 03 mm yr 1 are relatively small fig 9b presents the temporal variation in the ratios of et components to et despite the slight increase in es the ratio of es es et shows a significant downward trend of 7 67 decade 1 which means it decreases from 61 80 in 2000 to 44 85 in 2018 in contrast et et and ec et rise significantly with rates of 6 92 decade 1 from 28 04 to 43 81 and 1 27 decade 1 from 6 05 to 8 49 respectively and the variation in esn et is negligible therefore vegetation transpiration has recently become the primary component in the et process the seasonal cycle of et and the four components may change during the vegetation greening period we analysed the difference in their seasonal cycle between the early stage 2000 2003 and the recent stage 2015 2018 the seasonal cycles at the two stages were calculated by averaging the four year seasonal variability as shown in fig 10 a and b the recent stage et and es are quite distinct from the early stage specifically et is smaller than es during the yearly cycle at the early stage but this pattern changes at the recent stage as et overtakes es during the warm season from june to september in the warm season the difference in et is over 10 mm mon 1 while the difference in es is about 5 mm mon 1 fig 10c the differences in this season represent a 10 increase in et and a 15 decrease in es et rises for all months especially in july and august which is contributed by the substantial increase in et snow sublimation esn primarily occurs in winter with 2 09 mm mon 1 occupying a large portion 33 13 of the total et moreover the phenology of the peak values of et es and et advances from august at the early stage to july at the recent stage fig 10a and b 3 4 contributions analysis 3 4 1 changes in precipitation vegetation and radiation before quantifying the contributions of precipitation vegetation and radiation to et and its components we first identified the variations in these factors as shown in fig 11 the area with increased precipitation occupies 94 of the loess plateau 18 of which significantly increases and the maximum 10 mm yr 1 is mainly distributed in the mlp and decreased precipitation is sporadically distributed in the southeastern loess plateau fig 11a overall precipitation has a significant increase with a rate of 4 66 mm yr 1 p 0 05 for the period of 2000 2018 fig 11d similarly fvc rises in 92 0 of the whole region with 87 6 of the area having significant increases and the highest positive trends reaching 1 5 yr 1 fig 11b averaged over the loess plateau both fvc and lai exhibit upward trends at 0 466 yr 1 p 0 01 and 0 033 m2 m 2 yr 1 p 0 01 but they are only 20 and 1 3 m2 m 2 in 2018 respectively which may imply the limited vegetation transpiration fig 11e however the area with shortwave radiation decreasing accounts for 88 7 of the study region especially in the western part of the wlp whose values are up to 0 8 w m 2 yr 1 and the increasing rates are mostly in some parts of the nlp mlp and slp fig 11c generally shortwave radiation declines while longwave radiation rises fig 11f 3 4 2 yearly scale contributions in addition to the baseline simulation as described in subsection 2 4 the other three detrended simulations were conducted to quantify the contributions of precipitation vegetation and radiation to et processes the linear trend of the difference between each of the detrended simulations and the baseline simulation was calculated to represent the magnitude of the contribution as shown in fig 12 precipitation induces annual et increase in 75 of the study area with a magnitude of 2 87 mm yr 1 this contribution results from the induced primary increases in es 1 42 mm yr 1 and et 1 30 mm yr 1 and the minor increases in ec and esn obviously vegetation greenness promotes et and ec at rates of 3 21 mm yr 1 and 0 672 mm yr 1 respectively but it decreases es at a rate of 2 36 mm yr 1 therefore the contribution of vegetation greenness to et is about 1 52 mm yr 1 the effect of the radiation change on et and its components can be ignored ranging from 0 05 to 0 009 mm yr 1 moreover ec and esn whose ratios to et are quite small are mainly affected by vegetation and precipitation respectively 3 4 3 seasonal scale contributions we further analysed the seasonal scale contribution based on the baseline simulation and the four detrended simulations in addition to the average contribution over the loess plateau we also calculated the contributions for the five subregions because of their varying climate and vegetation conditions the absolute value of the contribution greater than 3 mm decade 1 is generally assumed to be the significant impact for the entire loess plateau as shown in fig 13 a vegetation greenness significantly increases transpiration et at rates of 4 7 mm decade 1 throughout the growing period from may to september but it substantially reduces soil evaporation es during this period the precipitation change promotes et with a peak strength of 3 mm decade 1 in july and august and it also intensifies es for the period from march to october while the rate is not significant 3 mm decade 1 the radiation forcing makes a relatively minor contribution throughout the year therefore the et increase is primarily caused by precipitation in the vegetation growing season from may to september with a peak contribution of 6 mm decade 1 in july the seasonal scale contribution shows spatial variability in the study area the effect of vegetation greenness is strongest in the subregions of mlp and elp where the lai and fvc present larger increases than the other subregions in the mlp vegetation transpiration is enhanced due to greenness particularly in july and august the greenness induced et increase is up to 14 mm decade 1 along with an es decrease of approximately 10 mm decade 1 a similar pattern appears in the elp but the peak of increased et and decreased es only occur in july the change in ec is only driven by vegetation greenness in all five subregions and the change in esn is not observable due to its relatively small variation 4 discussion 4 1 estimation and variation of et and its components partitioning et is quite challenging partly because of limited ground based observations and different algorithms or products may provide different estimates so substantial uncertainty exists and it is difficult to find the best model which is defined with the highest accuracy for estimating et components this study estimated et and its components based on the vic model which is sophisticated in considering energy balance and water constraints in the modelling we employed remote sensing based radiation products including the downward shortwave and longwave radiation and land surface albedo moreover the remote sensing data of lai and fvc products were used to represent vegetation dynamics benefited from the integration of these remote sensing products the hydrological modelling in this study was capable of capturing the dynamics of the four et components along with vegetation restoration on the loess plateau as evidenced by reference data of et components from ground based observations and remote sensing based products based on effective modelling this study quantified the variation in et components after ecological restoration the results showed that et mostly came from es about 60 roughly twice the magnitude from et during 2000 2018 this ratio was reasonable as the fractional vegetation coverage was still relatively low 20 in the study area even after vegetation restoration programs fig 11e the largest ratio of es occurred in the nlp and wlp where fractional vegetation coverage was 0 1 mu et al 2021 while the highest ratio of et appeared in the elp and eastern part of the mlp and wlp where the land cover was primarily forests fig 1b a similar pattern in which es accounted for a larger proportion of et than et was detected by liang et al 2020 who used a penman monteith based model to simulate et components this study showed that the total et exhibited a significant upward trend which was consistent with previous studies li et al 2021b ning et al 2020 zhang et al 2016a zhao et al 2021 zheng et al 2019 moreover the vegetation related evaporation i e et and ec increased at rates of 4 76 and 0 91 mm yr 1 respectively in the study period therefore the ratio of et et et showed a rising trend the increasing trends of et and ec were also found by liang et al 2020 and shao et al 2019 however we found that the trend of es in this study also showed a slight increase of 0 09 mm yr 1 which was inconsistent with the studies mentioned above this was partly because these studies failed to consider water constraints in et estimation and they focused on different periods despite the very small increase in annual es during 2000 2018 the ratio of es es et showed a substantial downward trend of 7 67 decade 1 our study also identified the seasonal cycle of et and its components in different stages of ecological restoration which has usually been ignored in other studies et rose in all months which perhaps affected humidity and soil moisture to some extent and in the recent stage et exceeded es becoming the main component in et from june to september due to vegetation greenness chen et al 2019 esn decreased by 14 in january because of the warming climate sun et al 2015 4 2 divergent response to vegetation greening previous studies have investigated the dominant factors influencing et processes on the loess plateau such as large scale afforestation lv et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 and precipitation he et al 2019 meng et al 2020 given the distinct arguments and divergent response of et components to climatic factors and vegetation variables our study fully explored the changes in the dominant factors of the components during 2000 2018 there is no doubt that the loess plateau has experienced a greening trend in recent years vegetation greenness enhances leaf area in regard to transpiration but reduces the area for soil evaporation moreover vegetation coverage prevents direct solar radiation forcing thereby reducing land surface temperature we found that vegetation greenness had a differential influence on vegetation associated evaporation et and ec and soil evaporation es whereas the total contribution to et was moderate specifically the vegetation greenness intensified et and ec at rates of 3 21 and 0 672 mm yr 1 respectively which was mostly counteracted by the contrasting trend of es approximately 2 36 mm yr 1 moreover it is known that precipitation variability largely influences seasonal and annual et dynamics in water limited areas as a typical dryland the loess plateau has increased precipitation after 2000 which has also been reported by other studies gao et al 2020 li et al 2021a liu et al 2016 shao et al 2019 therefore water availability should be the major factor driving et changes the results in this study confirmed that precipitation changes instead of vegetation greenness led to the increasing et trend after ecological restoration we noticed the above findings are different from other studies in which land use change was assumed to be the primary cause for the et increase e g feng et al 2016 the differences may stem from the study period the method for et calculation and the attribution analysis first annual precipitation has a slight increase 0 37 mm yr 1 during the first decade of the revegetation which is the period focused in precious studies but a relatively larger increase 4 66 mm yr 1 during 2000 2018 second feng et al 2016 indicated that annual et estimated from the areas without revegetation does not show any significant trend however this is not true for the period of 2000 2018 we calculated et for three typical land cover types i e cropland forest and grassland based on the estimates from vic pml and gleam we can see that et in cropland has an obvious increase and the change rate is larger than that in the forest fig 14 so the area without land use change e g cropland contributed substantial water consumption because the cropland area 2 016 105 km2 is larger than the forest area 0 946 105 km2 fig 14d third the methods for the et calculation are different our study calculated et based on the vic model which can consider water and energy balance feng et al 2016 used satellite derived et which failed to consider water constraints despite its acceptable performance moreover fvc was used to drive vic model which is important to partition et the average fvc for the period was only 15 so soil evaporation may be the primary contributor to water consumption our study is partly dedicated to updating findings from previous studies for the cause of the increased et and we argue that the effect of vegetation greening on water consumption was overestimated to a certain degree in addition to vegetation and precipitation this study identified the impact of radiation forcing and provided implications for the vpd although downward longwave radiation has been strengthened since 1990 wei et al 2021 and so did downward shortwave radiation yang et al 2018 our study discovered that radiation changes had little impact on et and its components this has been partly demonstrated in jiang et al 2021 who focused on the wet season et and indicated that et on the loess plateau has intensified by approximately 5 moreover we found that et increased at a rate of 5 73 mm yr 1 which was larger than the total contribution 4 34 mm yr 1 from precipitation vegetation and radiation therefore we inferred that vpd might contribute to an increase in et while our study did not isolate the impact of vpd which was a consequence of the air temperature and humidity and the et response varied due to the climate photosynthesis strategy and plant type massmann et al 2019 4 3 implications and future work the relative importance of et and es is highly dependent on vegetation coverage and water availability however hydrological modelling generally does not consider transient vegetation coverage information liu et al 2018 most satellite based et estimations lack water balance constraints due to reliable soil moisture data availability reitz et al 2017 yan et al 2012 zhao et al 2022 when evaluating et in arid and semiarid regions this study indicated that es rather than et is the primary component in et this relative role implies that when partitioning the et components it is important to consider water balance constraints and to include the dynamic fraction of vegetation coverage and not only the lai our study has implications for evaluating water consumption in areas with vegetation greening many national and international ecological programs have been launched for biodiversity conservation climate change mitigation and desertification reversion malagnoux et al 2007 strassburg et al 2020 revegetation is expected to increase vegetation greenness and to consequently disturb the hydrological cycle by reshaping et processes a few studies have concluded that afforestation or revegetation might be responsible for exacerbating water scarcity in water limited areas worldwide bai et al 2019 deng et al 2020 olivera guerra et al 2022 paiva alcoforado rebello et al 2020 ukkola et al 2016 vegetation greenness has the potential to aggravate water shortages with water resources reaching the limit on the loess plateau feng et al 2016 han et al 2020 li et al 2019 however our study demonstrates that the water consumption by vegetation greenness on the loess plateau may be overestimated because vegetation greenness constrained es along with the increased et in this arid and semiarid region es is still the primary component of water consumption the increased et is primarily caused by water availability i e increasing precipitation please note that the findings from this study do not contradict that vegetation greenness is partly responsible for the increased et vegetation greenness promotes more transpiration than water availability does moreover transpiration on the loess plateau is becoming a primary component approximately equal to or larger than soil evaporation we argue that there is a caveat for evaluating the hydrological effect of vegetation greenness particularly it is important to avoid the overestimation by considering the counterbalance between vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation there are future works needed to address the hydrological effect of vegetation greenness this study provided an example of water consumption in a typical dryland et consumption highly depends on the magnitude of greening climate conditions and radiation forcing therefore it would be a good attempt to characterize the hydrological effect in different regions or at the global scale with varying greenness moreover the climate system and vegetation have strong interactions zeng and neelin 2000 for example drought had a lagged effect on vegetation growth wu et al 2020 neglecting this interaction would cause uncertainties in addition vegetation greenness generates more litter coverage which plays an important role in the hydrological cycle the litter layer can affect root water uptake soil moisture evaporation and drainage to mineral soils du et al 2019 in hydrological modelling it would be important to consider the hydrological effect of litter coverage to achieve a holistic evaluation of vegetation greenness 5 conclusions in this study we examined et components in response to vegetation greening in a typical dryland i e the loess plateau in china the four et components et ec es and esn were successfully estimated based on sophisticated land surface hydrological modelling i e vic model which was featured by consideration of water and energy balance with transient vegetation structure and coverage constraints contrasting to conventional hydrological modelling newly released long term satellite products e g fvc lai and radiation parameters were integrated into this model to estimate et components the modelling achieved reliable estimation of the et components as evaluated using ground based observations and remote sensing based data based on hydrological modelling this study achieved a few interesting conclusions 1 soil evaporation es accounted for approximately 60 of et which was much larger than the vegetation transpiration et during the vegetation greening period of 2000 2018 so the water consumption on the loess plateau was primarily from es rather than et 2 despite a slight increase in es its ratio of es et decreased at a rate of 7 67 decade 1 along with a similar level of increase in et therefore et overtook es becoming the main component of et currently in the warm season from june to september 3 vegetation greenness substantially caused es to decline at a rate of 2 36 mm yr 1 implying that vegetation greening constrained es because vegetation coverage decreased the bare soil area and reduced land surface temperature in contrast the increased precipitation over the loess plateau provided more water availability thereby promoting all the four et components so it was the primary factor to promote water consumption 4 in the vegetation growing season and in the concentration areas of ecological restoration water availability was still the major contributor to intensify the total et because of the counterbalance between et and es the above findings imply that the role of vegetation greenness on water consumption may be overestimated for the loess plateau this does not necessarily mean that vegetation greenness is not responsible for water consumption global vegetation greenness will induce et consumption with spatial temporal variability it would be important to revisit the effect of vegetation greenness on water consumption by considering the constraints of vegetation greenness on soil evaporation moreover the water balance and the vegetation coverage magnitude should be included

2826,global vegetation greenness has likely enhanced evapotranspiration et that has been assumed to be the primary contributor to water consumption in some regions however the proportion of each et component and their changes given vegetation greening are unclear in this study we investigated the response of et components especially vegetation transpiration et and soil evaporation es to vegetation and climate changes in a typical dryland region i e the loess plateau in china where vegetation is significantly greening we used a sophisticated hydrological model i e the variable infiltration capacity vic to partition et which considers the water energy balance and vegetation dynamics associated with satellite products of fractional vegetation cover leaf area index surface albedo and radiation forcing the results showed that during the greening period of 2000 2018 et had the largest increasing rate among the components and accounted for 31 8 of the et in contrast es showed a minor increase but occupied a larger proportion of about 60 of et therefore water consumption was primarily from es rather than et despite the increased proportion of et vegetation greening certainly intensified et but also substantially constrained es with a rate of 2 36 mm yr 1 increasing water availability i e more precipitation on the loess plateau made the largest contribution to the increase in the annual et compared with vegetation greening and radiation forcing these findings imply that the effect of vegetation greening on water consumption may be overestimated on the loess

both of these changes could influence the et trend jiang et al 2021 in addition to water and energy constraints vegetation coverage also plays an important role in the terrestrial water cycle that affects et directly through transpiration and indirectly through determining surface absorbed radiation by albedo changes duveiller et al 2018 vegetation greening has been increasing globally since

to quantifying the contributions of various factors e g precipitation and vegetation to et changes a few studies reported that climate change especially precipitation determined the spatiotemporal variations in et and elevated atmospheric co2 ranked second after 1982 mao et al 2015 shi et al 2013 some studies found that vegetation greening was the primary driver of the global et increasing trend since 1982 zeng et al 2016 zhang et al 2015b jung et al 2010 indicated that increasing soil moisture limitations on et largely explained the declining trend of the global terrestrial et during 1998 2008 zhang et al 2016b analysed the effect of greening on es and et to explain the reasons for the et increase these findings reveal the complexity of interactions between climatic factors vegetation coverage and et but little attention has been paid to et components a suite of ecological restoration programs have been implemented over the loess plateau in china to alleviate soil erosion and deforestation since 1998 bryan et al 2018 making this region green in recent years liu et al 2020 moreover this region experienced a warm wet climate transition after 2000 he et al 2015 vegetation greening and climate change likely affected the regional water energy cycle feng et al 2012 jia et al 2017 wang et al 2020 xie et al 2015 zhang et al 2019a many studies have explored the impact of climate change and vegetation greening on et trends on the loess plateau bai et al 2019 chen et al 2017 gao et al 2017 jiang et al 2021 meng et al 2020 xie et al 2020 yao et al 2019 however these studies merely concentrated on the total water consumption i e et rather than et components that were the foundation for explaining the variation in et although some studies have investigated the changes in et components liang et al 2020 qiu et al 2021 shao et al 2019 they did not fully explore the contributions of climatic factors and vegetation coverage to et components which was associated with et partitioning after ecological restoration given the importance of partitioning et many methods have been developed at small scales e g plot and small catchment scales et partitioning is generally based on observations of co2 and water flux variance similarity relationships while eddy covariance determined ecosystem scale water use efficiency has also been used for partitioning et ma et al 2020 moreover transpiration and soil evaporation can be isolated either through a combination of stable isotope sap flow and eddy covariation techniques or with porometer lysimeter and bowen ratio techniques lawrence et al 2007 at large scales e g watershed regional and global scales et partitioning should rely on land surface models satellite based estimations and relationships with groundwater ma et al 2020 land surface models generally consider biophysical processes regarding hydrological cycle energy balance and vegetation dynamics this study attempted to identify the response of et components to climate change and vegetation greening on the loess plateau we employed a macroscale land surface hydrological model i e the variable infiltration capacity vic which well considers water constraints and energy balance along with incorporating the remote sensing based dynamic fractional vegetation coverage fvc leaf area index lai albedo and shortwave longwave radiation forcing the aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that vegetation greening constrains soil evaporation although it promotes vegetation transpiration this hypothesis is expected to be helpful for understanding the hydrological effect of vegetation greenness and for evaluating water consumption in drylands with afforestation reforestation practices 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the loess plateau is situated in the upper and middle reaches of the yellow river basin in northern china covering an area of 632 520 km2 and accounting for 6 3 of the entire land area of china fig 1 this region includes the whole or part of seven provinces qinghai gansu ningxia inner mongolia shaanxi henan and shanxi the average annual precipitation ranges from 200 mm in the northwest to 750 mm in the southeast with 60 70 of the rainfall occurring during summer in the form of heavy storms sun et al 2015 the mean annual air temperature is 4 in the northwest and 14 in the southeast peng et al 2018 therefore this region is a typical dryland with an arid semi arid and semi humid transitional climate the major land cover types are grasslands and croplands followed by forests bare land and urban areas fig 1b after many ecological restoration programs especially the grain for green project had been carried out bryan et al 2018 the areal coverage of grasslands and forests increased from 310 000 and 155 000 km2 in 2001 to 370 000 and 185 000 km2 in 2010 respectively and correspondingly the area of barren land and shrublands showed decreasing trends fan et al 2015 to detect the spatial variability of the vegetation greening effect we divided the loess plateau into five subregions according to ecological restoration and geographic features yang et al 2019 i e the north loess plateau nlp the middle loess plateau mlp the east loess plateau elp the west loess plateau wlp and the south loess plateau slp fig 1b the nlp is a typical semi arid area with average annual precipitation below 300 mm mostly covered by deserts such as mu us sandyland the mlp is the central focus of vegetation restoration programs with lai rising by 48 4 however it is characterized by loess hill and gully terrains the elp and wlp feature rocky mountains and loess sorghum gullies respectively the slp mainly river fault depression valleys is an economically developed area with a higher level of urbanization 2 2 data availability the vic model required various input data including meteorological forcing soil parameters vegetation parameters land cover type and topography the meteorological forcing data consisted of daily precipitation maximum and minimum air temperature wind speed and relative humidity from 1990 to 2018 these gridded data with a spatial resolution of 0 0625 were generated by using the inverse distance weighting method to interpolate ground based observations from 303 stations that were available from china meteorological administration cma https data cma cn data of soil and vegetation parameters e g architectural resistance minimum stomatal resistance and vegetation roughness for each land use type were obtained from the vic homepage https vic readthedocs io en master datasets datasets and they were generated by nijssen et al 2001 and successfully used in meng et al 2020 and zhu et al 2021 the land cover type data were produced by landsat tm images at a spatial resolution of 1 km liu et al 2010 obtained from national earth system science data center https www geodata cn it was assumed that in this study the land cover type for 2010 was in a steady state after ecological restoration programs as the land cover type changed little relative to the total area of the loess plateau during the study period jiang et al 2021 topographic data i e digital elevation model dem were used to extract watersheds and river networks over the loess plateau and were obtained from usgs https earthexplorer usgs gov remote sensing products including downward shortwave and longwave radiation albedo leaf area index lai and fractional vegetation cover fvc were also employed to drive the hydrological model apart from downward

surface satellite glass product suite https www geodata cn liang et al 2021 liang et al 2013 downward longwave radiation product was estimated directly from temperature surface pressure specific

spectral reflectance of modis zhang et al 2014 the glass albedo product was made by using an angular bin algorithm together with a statistics based temporal filter algorithm liu et al 2013 the glass lai product v5 was retrieved from the modis reflectance data using the general regression neural networks algorithm xiao et al 2014 and it was updated using a deep learning model ma and liang 2022 the glass fvc product was also obtained by using the general regression neural networks algorithm based on landsat tm etm and modis reflectance data jia et al 2015 to adapt to simulations with the vic model the 8 day composite lai and fvc data were linearly interpolated to a daily resolution to evaluate the model performance for et and its components several types of data including ground based observations water balance derived estimates and remote sensing retrievals were implemented we collected ground based daily et observations from three covariance flux towers fig 1a and table 1 of the coordinated enhanced observation project in arid and semi arid regions in northern china the et component data from field experiments were also obtained to validate ec et and es and these data have been successfully used to detect the water consumption from vegetation and bare soil as evidenced in the literature listed in table 2 please note the measurements of et ec et and es located different sites and their data were at different time scales i e daily scales for et and monthly scales for the three components the ground based observations of total et and its components only represent small scale evaporation flux 1 km2 therefore we derived annual water balance based et estimates i e et p q δs where p is the annual precipitation q is the annual runoff and δs is the change of total water storage the annual runoff was calculated based on monthly streamflow data of eight catchments on the loess plateau fig 1a which were obtained from the annual hydrological report for china the change of total water storage δs of each catchment was derived from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace with respect to the average of three solutions i e csr https www2 csr utexas edu grace gsfc https earth gsfc nasa gov geo and jpl mascon https grace jpl nasa gov moreover we collected two remote sensing et products from global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 and penman monteith leuning pml zhang et al 2019b zhang et al 2016b both the gleam and pml products used lai to represent vegetation dynamics and simply considered water balance gleam et was at 0 25 and daily resolution and pml et was at 0 05 and 8 day resolution both of which were interpolated to 0 0625 and daily resolution in this study to relieve their uncertainties we averaged the two products to obtain a more reliable et estimation which was referred to as remote sensing et in this study 2 3 hydrological model for et partitioning the variable infiltration capacity vic model was adopted to estimate et components and to detect their drivers on the loess plateau the vic model an extensively used macroscale hydrological model liang et al 1994 liang et al 1996 is able to solve the problems of water and energy balance with vegetation soil and atmosphere haddeland et al 2006 nijssen et al 2001 painter et al 2010 it is a grid based model that can be implemented at different spatial from 0 0625 to 2 latitude by longitude and temporal resolutions from hourly to daily for land cover variability each grid cell is partitioned into multiple vegetation types and bare soil and the soil column is typically divided into three or more layers so the model considers root distribution in multiple layers but it fails to represent growth with root dynamics however it can incorporate remote sensing products e g lai and fvc to partly remedy this issue hydrological states and variables such as infiltration surface runoff subsurface runoff evapotranspiration et land surface temperature and energy flux are calculated at the subgrid scale and finally aggregated to the grid scale we briefly describe the formulation of the et and its components here the vic model partitions et into four components soil evaporation es vegetation transpiration et canopy interception loss ec and snow sublimation esn the total et over a grid cell is computed as the sum of the above components weighted by their respective surface cover area fractions which is 1 et n 1 n c n e c n e t n c n 1 e s e sn where cn is the fractional vegetation coverage fvc for the nth vegetation title which is often regarded as a constant in the study period but a dynamic fvc can better represent vegetation growth providing more accurate et simulations cn 1 is the soil fraction and n 1 n 1 c n 1 vegetation transpiration canopy interception loss and soil evaporation are all developed by constraining the potential evapotranspiration from the penman monteith formulation shuttleworth 1993 which sets the bulk surface resistant as zero to be simplified to the penman formulation for potential et computation in this model 2 e p δ r n g ρ a c p d r a λ δ γ where ep is the potential

canopy interception loss vegetation transpiration can occur and is estimated as 4 e t 1 f e p r a r a r o r c f 1 w i w im 2 3 e p r a r a r o r c where et is vegetation transpiration mm and rc is the

photosynthetically active radiation flux par factor respectively gsm is a soil moisture stress factor that depends on the soil moisture content and lai is the leaf area index m2 m 2 which is usually a static interannually invariant index in most studies but dynamic lai is used to reflect the interannual change in vegetation in this study soil evaporation only occurs for the area without vegetation coverage i e bare land on the top thin layer when the surface soil is saturated it evaporates at the potential evaporation rate otherwise its evaporation varies according to the heterogeneities in infiltration topography and soil characteristics soil evaporation is described as 6 e s e p 0 a s da a s 1 i 0 i m 1 1 a 1 b i d a where es is the soil evaporation mm im is the maximum infiltration capacity mm a is the fraction of area for which the infiltration capacity is less than the current infiltration capacity i bi is the infiltration shape parameter as represents the fraction of the bare soil that is saturated and i0 represents the corresponding point infiltration capacity so es is dependent on soil moisture condition snow sublimation is calculated directly from a modified energy balance energy exchange between atmosphere forest canopy and snowpack occurs only within the surface layer for specific calculations of the snow sublimation and the parameters and variables described above please refer to the original vic papers liang et al 1994 from the above description we can see that the vic model features prominently in the computation of the et components by considering energy balance and establishing water constraints so that the interaction between soil moisture dynamics and et processes are well formulated this feature makes it more suitable for et estimation than remote sensing based et algorithms in water limited conditions which generally only employ energy balance to constrain e g the priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl model fisher et al 2008 as expressed in the above equations the vic model also applies vegetation structure i e lai for each land use type and coverage i e fvc to reflect the impact of land cover on et however the original version of the vic generally employs static lai and fvc with climatological conditions which is able to represent seasonal variability rather than interannual dynamics to remedy this issue this study applied daily lai and fvc from the glass products to force the vic simulations and this application has been demonstrated to be effective in hydrological simulations due to the representation of vegetation dynamics jiang et al 2021 meng et al 2020 2 4 simulation experimental design we designed one baseline and three detrended scenarios i e p det v det and ra det table 3 to quantify the hydrological effects of precipitation change vegetation greening and radiation change respectively on the loess plateau for 2000 2018 the four were run at spatial temporal resolutions of 0 0625 and 3 h to achieve water and energy balances the difference in et and its components between the baseline scenario and the different detrended scenario is assumed to represent the contributions of precipitation change vegetation greening or radiation change for the baseline scenario the model was run using the original forcing data including dynamic vegetation coverage and radiation forcing for the p det scenario the trend of precipitation was linearly removed and the other forcing variables remained the same as those in the baseline scenario similarly with respect to the ra det scenario the downward longwave and shortwave radiation data were linearly detrended the detrended method used in the p det and ra det simulation schemes is as follows 7 v y i d v y i a y b y i v y i v y i d whereyi is a year within 2000 2018 v y i d is the detrended daily precipitation shortwave radiation or longwave radiation on day d in the year yi v y i d is the original daily precipitation shortwave radiation or longwave radiation v y i is the annual daily precipitation shortwave radiation or longwave radiation in the year yi yb is the reference year 2000 and a is the linear trend of annual precipitation shortwave radiation or longwave radiation the detrended time series v y i d maintains the seasonal variations but has no interannual trend for the v det scenario the daily mean values of lai fvc and albedo during 2000 2002 were used to drive the vic model for the period 2000 2018 this strategy not only removes the variation trend but also avoids abrupt land cover changes in a given year while there are many factors influencing land surface albedo e g vegetation coverage soil moisture and snow coverage land use and land cover are generally assumed as the primary factors therefore this study takes the effect of albedo on et as one of the vegetation contributors although it is connected to radiation balance 3 results 3 1 model evaluation 3 1 1 ground based evaluation the metrics of root mean square error rmse pearson correlation coefficient r and the relative bias bias were used to examine the robustness of the vic model we first compared simulations with ground based observations fig 2 shows the simulated et against observed et at three towers on a daily basis the simulated et is consistent with the observations as the r is up to 0 68 and the relative bias ranges from 35 4 to 2 7 the model also presents acceptable performance for transpiration et canopy interception loss ec and soil evaporation es simulations the r for et is more than 0 45 with the relative bias 24 8 fig 3 similar levels of the three metrics are obtained for ec and es while the numbers of their observation points are relatively small fig 4 the vic model was further evaluated based on the catchment scale runoff and the associated water balance derived et we used another metric i e the kling gupta efficiency index kge gupta et al 2009 instead of rmse to detect the runoff simulation performance as it is more robust and widely used in streamflow evaluation althoff and rodrigues 2021 as shown in table 4 the model can reasonably simulate the monthly runoff for the eight catchments with kge more than 0 31 and bias 33 93 the simulations generally capture the peak flow and baseflow well at most stations although relatively poor performance occurs when tracing the peak flow at linjiaping and gaoshiya stations fig 5 for the water balance derived et the model achieves r of 0 69 and bias of 5 2 fig 5i although the model seems to slightly underestimate et and the components to some degree the overall performance is acceptable to match the ground based observations 3 1 2 remote sensing based comparison in addition to the ground based evaluation we employed gleam and pml products both of which simply incorporated water constraints by solving the water balance equation with precipitation as input in the et estimation fig 6 compares the simulated et with remote sensing et i e the average between gleam et and pml et in the growing season may october during the period 2003 2018 since the pml product has a large amount of missing data for the first three years of 2000 2002 the spatial pattern of the simulated et is in agreement with that of the remote sensing estimation displaying lower values in the northwest and higher values in the southeast fig 6a and b and with bias ranging between 40 and 20 fig 6c the simulated interannual et variability also closely follows that of the remote sensing et with r of 0 91 and bias of 3 40 fig 6d to further confirm our simulations et and its components et ec and es of our study were compared with those of gleam and pml for the growing season during 2003 2018 we focused the inter annual variations of the four variables which was important to reflect the change trends of the four thus we computed their time series anomalies by removing their long term means the trends of the four components from the three estimations are consistent et et and ec increase but es decreases in this period despite slight differences between the vic simulation and the other two products fig 7 this consistency also indicates the reliability of the estimations of the et components 3 2 spatial distribution the spatial distribution of the mean annual et and the ratio of each et component are shown in fig 8 the mean annual et over the entire region is about 390 mm but large spatial heterogeneity can be seen in the study area with lower values 200 mm in the northwestern part and higher values greater than 500 mm in the southeastern part fig 8a this spatial pattern is consistent with the distribution of precipitation averaged over the whole region es accounts for the largest proportion of et about 60 followed by et ec and esn fig 8b which indicates that soil evaporation consumes more water than vegetation transpiration however the ratios of the four components to the total et present contrasting spatial distributions fig 8c f in the nlp and northern part of the wlp et primarily comes from es with es et above 75 because the land cover type is mainly desert and these areas are under a dry climate in contrast in the elp and eastern part of the wlp and mlp et is the main contributor with et et greater than 50 and ec et is also as high as 15 because the land cover in these areas is dominated by forest and grassland in terms of esn it occupies only a little portion of et below 6 except for a small area in the western part of the wlp whose elevation is more than 4000 m 3 3 temporal changes to detect the difference of the changes in et and its components so as to identify which one is the largest contributor to the total et interannual variations are depicted in fig 9 a the average annual et on the loess plateau exhibits a significantly increasing trend of 5 73 mm yr 1 totalling 108 87 mm during 2000 2018 which results from the significant positive trends in et 4 76 mm yr 1 p 0 01 and ec 0 91 mm yr 1 p 0 01 while the trends of es 0 09 mm yr 1 and esn 0 03 mm yr 1 are relatively small fig 9b presents the temporal variation in the ratios of et components to et despite the slight increase in es the ratio of es es et shows a significant downward trend of 7 67 decade 1 which means it decreases from 61 80 in 2000 to 44 85 in 2018 in contrast et et and ec et rise significantly with rates of 6 92 decade 1 from 28 04 to 43 81 and 1 27 decade 1 from 6 05 to 8 49 respectively and the variation in esn et is negligible therefore vegetation transpiration has recently become the primary component in the et process the seasonal cycle of et and the four components may change during the vegetation greening period we analysed the difference in their seasonal cycle between the early stage 2000 2003 and the recent stage 2015 2018 the seasonal cycles at the two stages were calculated by averaging the four year seasonal variability as shown in fig 10 a and b the recent stage et and es are quite distinct from the early stage specifically et is smaller than es during the yearly cycle at the early stage but this pattern changes at the recent stage as et overtakes es during the warm season from june to september in the warm season the difference in et is over 10 mm mon 1 while the difference in es is about 5 mm mon 1 fig 10c the differences in this season represent a 10 increase in et and a 15 decrease in es et rises for all months especially in july and august which is contributed by the substantial increase in et snow sublimation esn primarily occurs in winter with 2 09 mm mon 1 occupying a large portion 33 13 of the total et moreover the phenology of the peak values of et es and et advances from august at the early stage to july at the recent stage fig 10a and b 3 4 contributions analysis 3 4 1 changes in precipitation vegetation and radiation before quantifying the contributions of precipitation vegetation and radiation to et and its components we first identified the variations in these factors as shown in fig 11 the area with increased precipitation occupies 94 of the loess plateau 18 of which significantly increases and the maximum 10 mm yr 1 is mainly distributed in the mlp and decreased precipitation is sporadically distributed in the southeastern loess plateau fig 11a overall precipitation has a significant increase with a rate of 4 66 mm yr 1 p 0 05 for the period of 2000 2018 fig 11d similarly fvc rises in 92 0 of the whole region with 87 6 of the area having significant increases and the highest positive trends reaching 1 5 yr 1 fig 11b averaged over the loess plateau both fvc and lai exhibit upward trends at 0 466 yr 1 p 0 01 and 0 033 m2 m 2 yr 1 p 0 01 but they are only 20 and 1 3 m2 m 2 in 2018 respectively which may imply the limited vegetation transpiration fig 11e however the area with shortwave radiation decreasing accounts for 88 7 of the study region especially in the western part of the wlp whose values are up to 0 8 w m 2 yr 1 and the increasing rates are mostly in some parts of the nlp mlp and slp fig 11c generally shortwave radiation declines while longwave radiation rises fig 11f 3 4 2 yearly scale contributions in addition to the baseline simulation as described in subsection 2 4 the other three detrended simulations were conducted to quantify the contributions of precipitation vegetation and radiation to et processes the linear trend of the difference between each of the detrended simulations and the baseline simulation was calculated to represent the magnitude of the contribution as shown in fig 12 precipitation induces annual et increase in 75 of the study area with a magnitude of 2 87 mm yr 1 this contribution results from the induced primary increases in es 1 42 mm yr 1 and et 1 30 mm yr 1 and the minor increases in ec and esn obviously vegetation greenness promotes et and ec at rates of 3 21 mm yr 1 and 0 672 mm yr 1 respectively but it decreases es at a rate of 2 36 mm yr 1 therefore the contribution of vegetation greenness to et is about 1 52 mm yr 1 the effect of the radiation change on et and its components can be ignored ranging from 0 05 to 0 009 mm yr 1 moreover ec and esn whose ratios to et are quite small are mainly affected by vegetation and precipitation respectively 3 4 3 seasonal scale contributions we further analysed the seasonal scale contribution based on the baseline simulation and the four detrended simulations in addition to the average contribution over the loess plateau we also calculated the contributions for the five subregions because of their varying climate and vegetation conditions the absolute value of the contribution greater than 3 mm decade 1 is generally assumed to be the significant impact for the entire loess plateau as shown in fig 13 a vegetation greenness significantly increases transpiration et at rates of 4 7 mm decade 1 throughout the growing period from may to september but it substantially reduces soil evaporation es during this period the precipitation change promotes et with a peak strength of 3 mm decade 1 in july and august and it also intensifies es for the period from march to october while the rate is not significant 3 mm decade 1 the radiation forcing makes a relatively minor contribution throughout the year therefore the et increase is primarily caused by precipitation in the vegetation growing season from may to september with a peak contribution of 6 mm decade 1 in july the seasonal scale contribution shows spatial variability in the study area the effect of vegetation greenness is strongest in the subregions of mlp and elp where the lai and fvc present larger increases than the other subregions in the mlp vegetation transpiration is enhanced due to greenness particularly in july and august the greenness induced et increase is up to 14 mm decade 1 along with an es decrease of approximately 10 mm decade 1 a similar pattern appears in the elp but the peak of increased et and decreased es only occur in july the change in ec is only driven by vegetation greenness in all five subregions and the change in esn is not observable due to its relatively small variation 4 discussion 4 1 estimation and variation of et and its components partitioning et is quite challenging partly because of limited ground based observations and different algorithms or products may provide different estimates so substantial uncertainty exists and it is difficult to find the best model which is defined with the highest accuracy for estimating et components this study estimated et and its components based on the vic model which is sophisticated in considering energy balance and water constraints in the modelling we employed remote sensing based radiation products including the downward shortwave and longwave radiation and land surface albedo moreover the remote sensing data of lai and fvc products were used to represent vegetation dynamics benefited from the integration of these remote sensing products the hydrological modelling in this study was capable of capturing the dynamics of the four et components along with vegetation restoration on the loess plateau as evidenced by reference data of et components from ground based observations and remote sensing based products based on effective modelling this study quantified the variation in et components after ecological restoration the results showed that et mostly came from es about 60 roughly twice the magnitude from et during 2000 2018 this ratio was reasonable as the fractional vegetation coverage was still relatively low 20 in the study area even after vegetation restoration programs fig 11e the largest ratio of es occurred in the nlp and wlp where fractional vegetation coverage was 0 1 mu et al 2021 while the highest ratio of et appeared in the elp and eastern part of the mlp and wlp where the land cover was primarily forests fig 1b a similar pattern in which es accounted for a larger proportion of et than et was detected by liang et al 2020 who used a penman monteith based model to simulate et components this study showed that the total et exhibited a significant upward trend which was consistent with previous studies li et al 2021b ning et al 2020 zhang et al 2016a zhao et al 2021 zheng et al 2019 moreover the vegetation related evaporation i e et and ec increased at rates of 4 76 and 0 91 mm yr 1 respectively in the study period therefore the ratio of et et et showed a rising trend the increasing trends of et and ec were also found by liang et al 2020 and shao et al 2019 however we found that the trend of es in this study also showed a slight increase of 0 09 mm yr 1 which was inconsistent with the studies mentioned above this was partly because these studies failed to consider water constraints in et estimation and they focused on different periods despite the very small increase in annual es during 2000 2018 the ratio of es es et showed a substantial downward trend of 7 67 decade 1 our study also identified the seasonal cycle of et and its components in different stages of ecological restoration which has usually been ignored in other studies et rose in all months which perhaps affected humidity and soil moisture to some extent and in the recent stage et exceeded es becoming the main component in et from june to september due to vegetation greenness chen et al 2019 esn decreased by 14 in january because of the warming climate sun et al 2015 4 2 divergent response to vegetation greening previous studies have investigated the dominant factors influencing et processes on the loess plateau such as large scale afforestation lv et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 and precipitation he et al 2019 meng et al 2020 given the distinct arguments and divergent response of et components to climatic factors and vegetation variables our study fully explored the changes in the dominant factors of the components during 2000 2018 there is no doubt that the loess plateau has experienced a greening trend in recent years vegetation greenness enhances leaf area in regard to transpiration but reduces the area for soil evaporation moreover vegetation coverage prevents direct solar radiation forcing thereby reducing land surface temperature we found that vegetation greenness had a differential influence on vegetation associated evaporation et and ec and soil evaporation es whereas the total contribution to et was moderate specifically the vegetation greenness intensified et and ec at rates of 3 21 and 0 672 mm yr 1 respectively which was mostly counteracted by the contrasting trend of es approximately 2 36 mm yr 1 moreover it is known that precipitation variability largely influences seasonal and annual et dynamics in water limited areas as a typical dryland the loess plateau has increased precipitation after 2000 which has also been reported by other studies gao et al 2020 li et al 2021a liu et al 2016 shao et al 2019 therefore water availability should be the major factor driving et changes the results in this study confirmed that precipitation changes instead of vegetation greenness led to the increasing et trend after ecological restoration we noticed the above findings are different from other studies in which land use change was assumed to be the primary cause for the et increase e g feng et al 2016 the differences may stem from the study period the method for et calculation and the attribution analysis first annual precipitation has a slight increase 0 37 mm yr 1 during the first decade of the revegetation which is the period focused in precious studies but a relatively larger increase 4 66 mm yr 1 during 2000 2018 second feng et al 2016 indicated that annual et estimated from the areas without revegetation does not show any significant trend however this is not true for the period of 2000 2018 we calculated et for three typical land cover types i e cropland forest and grassland based on the estimates from vic pml and gleam we can see that et in cropland has an obvious increase and the change rate is larger than that in the forest fig 14 so the area without land use change e g cropland contributed substantial water consumption because the cropland area 2 016 105 km2 is larger than the forest area 0 946 105 km2 fig 14d third the methods for the et calculation are different our study calculated et based on the vic model which can consider water and energy balance feng et al 2016 used satellite derived et which failed to consider water constraints despite its acceptable performance moreover fvc was used to drive vic model which is important to partition et the average fvc for the period was only 15 so soil evaporation may be the primary contributor to water consumption our study is partly dedicated to updating findings from previous studies for the cause of the increased et and we argue that the effect of vegetation greening on water consumption was overestimated to a certain degree in addition to vegetation and precipitation this study identified the impact of radiation forcing and provided implications for the vpd although downward longwave radiation has been strengthened since 1990 wei et al 2021 and so did downward shortwave radiation yang et al 2018 our study discovered that radiation changes had little impact on et and its components this has been partly demonstrated in jiang et al 2021 who focused on the wet season et and indicated that et on the loess plateau has intensified by approximately 5 moreover we found that et increased at a rate of 5 73 mm yr 1 which was larger than the total contribution 4 34 mm yr 1 from precipitation vegetation and radiation therefore we inferred that vpd might contribute to an increase in et while our study did not isolate the impact of vpd which was a consequence of the air temperature and humidity and the et response varied due to the climate photosynthesis strategy and plant type massmann et al 2019 4 3 implications and future work the relative importance of et and es is highly dependent on vegetation coverage and water availability however hydrological modelling generally does not consider transient vegetation coverage information liu et al 2018 most satellite based et estimations lack water balance constraints due to reliable soil moisture data availability reitz et al 2017 yan et al 2012 zhao et al 2022 when evaluating et in arid and semiarid regions this study indicated that es rather than et is the primary component in et this relative role implies that when partitioning the et components it is important to consider water balance constraints and to include the dynamic fraction of vegetation coverage and not only the lai our study has implications for evaluating water consumption in areas with vegetation greening many national and international ecological programs have been launched for biodiversity conservation climate change mitigation and desertification reversion malagnoux et al 2007 strassburg et al 2020 revegetation is expected to increase vegetation greenness and to consequently disturb the hydrological cycle by reshaping et processes a few studies have concluded that afforestation or revegetation might be responsible for exacerbating water scarcity in water limited areas worldwide bai et al 2019 deng et al 2020 olivera guerra et al 2022 paiva alcoforado rebello et al 2020 ukkola et al 2016 vegetation greenness has the potential to aggravate water shortages with water resources reaching the limit on the loess plateau feng et al 2016 han et al 2020 li et al 2019 however our study demonstrates that the water consumption by vegetation greenness on the loess plateau may be overestimated because vegetation greenness constrained es along with the increased et in this arid and semiarid region es is still the primary component of water consumption the increased et is primarily caused by water availability i e increasing precipitation please note that the findings from this study do not contradict that vegetation greenness is partly responsible for the increased et vegetation greenness promotes more transpiration than water availability does moreover transpiration on the loess plateau is becoming a primary component approximately equal to or larger than soil evaporation we argue that there is a caveat for evaluating the hydrological effect of vegetation greenness particularly it is important to avoid the overestimation by considering the counterbalance between vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation there are future works needed to address the hydrological effect of vegetation greenness this study provided an example of water consumption in a typical dryland et consumption highly depends on the magnitude of greening climate conditions and radiation forcing therefore it would be a good attempt to characterize the hydrological effect in different regions or at the global scale with varying greenness moreover the climate system and vegetation have strong interactions zeng and neelin 2000 for example drought had a lagged effect on vegetation growth wu et al 2020 neglecting this interaction would cause uncertainties in addition vegetation greenness generates more litter coverage which plays an important role in the hydrological cycle the litter layer can affect root water uptake soil moisture evaporation and drainage to mineral soils du et al 2019 in hydrological modelling it would be important to consider the hydrological effect of litter coverage to achieve a holistic evaluation of vegetation greenness 5 conclusions in this study we examined et components in response to vegetation greening in a typical dryland i e the loess plateau in china the four et components et ec es and esn were successfully estimated based on sophisticated land surface hydrological modelling i e vic model which was featured by consideration of water and energy balance with transient vegetation structure and coverage constraints contrasting to conventional hydrological modelling newly released long term satellite products e g fvc lai and radiation parameters were integrated into this model to estimate et components the modelling achieved reliable estimation of the et components as evaluated using ground based observations and remote sensing based data based on hydrological modelling this study achieved a few interesting conclusions 1 soil evaporation es accounted for approximately 60 of et which was much larger than the vegetation transpiration et during the vegetation greening period of 2000 2018 so the water consumption on the loess plateau was primarily from es rather than et 2 despite a slight increase in es its ratio of es et decreased at a rate of 7 67 decade 1 along with a similar level of increase in et therefore et overtook es becoming the main component of et currently in the warm season from june to september 3 vegetation greenness substantially caused es to decline at a rate of 2 36 mm yr 1 implying that vegetation greening constrained es because vegetation coverage decreased the bare soil area and reduced land surface temperature in contrast the increased precipitation over the loess plateau provided more water availability thereby promoting all the four et components so it was the primary factor to promote water consumption 4 in the vegetation growing season and in the concentration areas of ecological restoration water availability was still the major contributor to intensify the total et because of the counterbalance between et and es the above findings imply that the role of vegetation greenness on water consumption may be overestimated for the loess plateau this does not necessarily mean that vegetation greenness is not responsible for water consumption global vegetation greenness will induce et consumption with spatial temporal variability it would be important to revisit the effect of vegetation greenness on water consumption by considering the constraints of vegetation greenness on soil evaporation moreover the water balance and the vegetation coverage magnitude should be included

2827,the flow properties sediment moving and geomorphology in the grouped spur dikes field have always been of interest in river engineering in this paper a 3d numerical model is employed to investigate the flow motion and riverbed scouring around grouped spur dikes with different layout angle styles series of flume experiments are introduced to verify this model s reliability before its application on the simulation of the downward angled spur dikes case and normal angled spur dikes case respectively and detailed comparative analyses on the flow intensity vortex patterns and local scour are made for these two layout angle styles respectively in which the similarities and differences could both be found then the influence of flow conditions sediment parameters and spur dike layout angles on the maximum scour depth and their coordinates are discussed through additional simulations while the different correlations show between the maximum scour depths with these three factors then the simulation of flood passage through the spur dike fields is conducted which could not only provide river hydrological information but also offer guidance for the hydraulic structure safety keywords 3d numerical model grouped spur dikes layout angle flow motion local scour data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the spur dikes are commonly used in medium scale river engineering for the purposes of channel realignment environmental protection and ecological conservation as a result the flow motion and sediment transport in the vicinity have always been hot research issues for river hydrology however the complexity of these problems cannot be neglected flow separation and circumfluence behind the spur dikes result in strongly 3d turbulence which directly affect the sediment transport and local scour around the spur dike and the eventual balance are reached as flow and sediment strongly coupled with each other therefore most researchers especially in early stage usually conduct studies on isolated spur dike case rather than grouped spur dikes tingsanchali and maheswaran 1990 mayerle et al 1995 molls et al 1995 ouillon and dartus 1997 kuhnle et al 1999 kuhnle et al 2008 nakagawa et al 2004 nagata et al 2005 mccoy et al 2007 mccoy et al 2008 duan 2009 koken and constantinescu 2009 koken and constantinescu 2011 yu et al 2010 kang et al 2011b peng et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 khosronejad et al 2013 khosronejad et al 2014 however it is more practical that the spur dikes are constructed in group for various engineering needs which is also known as the grouped spur dikes field in engineering projects fig 1 the motion of flow and sediment would be more complicated in this kind of system because of the interaction between these spur dikes therefore although the achievements on isolated spur dike cases can provide fairly useful references further studies on the fluid motion and sediment transport in grouped spur dikes system are still needed compared with the studies of the isolated spur dike the research on grouped spur dike is much insufficient while flume experiment and field measurement are the main methods and the research systematicness is also relatively poor bahar and fukuoka 1999 uijttewaal et al 2001 muto et al 2003 engelhardt et al 2004 mccoy et al 2006 mccoy et al 2007 mccoy et al 2008 constantinescu et al 2009 yossef and huib 2010 kang et al 2011a gu et al 2011 karami et al 2014 furthermore majority of these studies focus on the spur dikes perpendicular to one side wall in experimental flumes rather than those of practical applications symmetrically placed in waterways which are commonly with downward layout angles fig 2 under these circumstances the knowledge of how the flow properties and local scour respond to the variation of spur dikes layout angles mostly comes from the field observations in engineering practices instead of scientific analyses which leaves the hydrological investigators lots of unsolved questions kuhnle et al 2002 sukhodolov et al 2002 cuong et al 2019 jafari and sui 2021 therefore we illustrate an application of a 3d numerical model on studying the influence of spur dikes layout angles on flow motion and sediment transport around them this numerical platform named newtank has already been successfully used on a variety of hydrodynamic cases for the past two decades lin and li 2003 gu et al 2005 liu and lin 2008 lin et al 2016 han et al 2022 the introduction of porous medium method pmm in present model version allows the structure like spur dikes as well as the complex bed forms can be conducted with the same numerical method in the rectangle mesh system resulting in the model building procedure being much more convenient in present study we introduce the model firstly and then present verifications against flume experiments to test the model s reliability afterwards this model is applied to investigate the flow motion and local scour of spur dikes fields with two different layout types in which the detailed 3d flow field sediment motion and riverbed scouring are obtained then the maximum scour depths along with their coordinates in extended flow sediment and layout angle conditions are analyzed for engineering purpose while the simulation of flood passage through the spur dike fields is conducted to study the dynamic process of sediment transport and scour development under an unsteady flow condition 2 numerical methodology the present numerical model can be divided into a hydrodynamic component and a sediment component detailed description of which had already been made in han et al 2018 han et al 2022 so only some vital governing equations are illustrated in this part the motion of incompressible fluid within and outside porous medium can be described by the modified navier stokes equations karunarathna and lin 2006 lin and karunarathna 2007 1 u i x i 0 2 1 n u i t u j n 2 u i x j 1 ρ p 0 x i ν n 2 u i x j x j f i 1 n 2 u i u j x j where u i is the spatially averaged flow velocity in the i direction p0 is the effective pressure and ρ ν and n are fluid density fluid kinematic viscosity and effective porosity respectively the force f i is caused by the presence of porous material which includes inertia and drag forces f i f ii f di the concept of two phase flow is employed in this model a scalar transport equation of volume of fluid vof function f is solved to determine the volumetric fraction of water in all cells while the three dimensional plic vof gueyffier et al 1999 method is used to reconstruct the interface and to determine the vof fluxes in all computational cells 3 f t u i f x i 0 with the help of the vof function the density of fluid can be rewritten as ρ f ρ w 1 f ρ a where the subscripts w and a denote water and air respectively in the present model large eddy simulation les is introduced to capture turbulence transport and dissipation after being filtered by the spatial filter top hat function the sub grid stress terms appear in the momentum equations can be modeled by the smagorinsky sub grid scale model smagorinsky 1963 4 τ ij 1 3 τ kk δ ij 2 ρ ν t u i x j u j x i where ν t c s δ 2 s is the eddy viscosity cs is the smagorinsky coefficient δ δ x δ y δ z 3 is the filter size calculated by the control volume δxδyδz the dynamic smagorinsky model germano et al 1991 is embedded into the original smagorinsky model by letting the parameter cdyn evolve in time and space as a function of the flow field with the help of parameters obtained from the hydrodynamic component as well as the velocity components and bed shear stress at the near wall nodes calculated by applying the wall function khosronejad et al 2013 the control equation of sediment transport could then be resolved the suspended load concentration is calculated by the advection diffusion equation from which the volumetric concentration c can be calculated across the whole computational domain 5 c t x i u i c w s δ j 3 c ε si 2 c x i 2 where u i is the flow velocity calculated from the hydrodynamic component and εsi is the sediment mixing coefficient which relates to the fluid mixing coefficient van rijn 1984 abdel fattah et al s relation abdel fattah et al 2004 is introduced to describe the bed load transport rate 6 q b 0 053 s 1 g d 50 3 t 2 1 d 0 3 t 3 0 100 s 1 g d 50 3 t 1 5 d 0 3 t 3 where d50 is the median grain size of sediment t is the non dimensional excess shear stress and d is the non dimensional grain size while the effects of bed slope on critical shear stress and bed load transport rate are also taken into account in this model van rijn 1993 the morphological variation is calculated based on the sediment mass balance equation 7 1 λ p η t d a e a q bx x q by y where λp is the porosity of bed η is the bed elevation qbx and qby are the bed load transport rates in the and y directions da and ea are the deposition and entrainment rates respectively which can be evaluated from 8 e a 0 015 w s d 50 a t 1 5 d 0 3 9 d a w s c a where a is a reference level and ca is the effective boundary concentration at that level this numerical model is constructed on a non uniform cartesian coordinate system a staggered grid system is adopted which means that scalars are defined at cell centers and vectors are defined at the centers of cell faces 3 model verification 3 1 isolated spur dike with fixed bed series of flume experiments on the isolated spur dike with fixed bed were carried out in the state key laboratory of hydraulic and mountain river engineering of sichuan university and the partially emergent spur dike case is numerically simulated with the computational domains and flow conditions being identical to those of the experimental test which has been reported in han et al 2022 in detail the numerical results of flow field over a 300 s time window were compared to the experimental data taken by piv with the same averaging window since recirculation behind the spur dike forms a vortex in the time averaged computational domain the xy plane z 0 05 m is found to provide a good representation of the flow field therefore series of lines on this plane along which the coordinate is constant x 20 mm x 40 mm x 80 mm x 160 mm x 240 mm x 480 mm are chosen a comparison of flow velocity magnitude varying with the y coordinate along these lines between numerical results and experimental data is drawn in fig 3 and fairly good agreement shows which demonstrates that the present numerical model can accurately capture the flow field and reproduce the vortexes formed around the spur dike 3 2 trench evolution under open channel flow since the erosion and deposition play a significant role in developing bed morphology the experimental test for evolution of a trench under open channel flow van rijn 1993 is employed here to test the capability of this model on accurately reproducing these two processes the flume is 30 m 0 5 m 0 7 m for the length width and height respectively the sediment particles on sand bed have median grain size d50 0 16 mm and sand of the same size and composition is fed at the upstream inlet to so as to maintain the just equilibrium state the water depth equals 0 39 m and the roughness height is 0 025 m while the flow velocity at the flume inlet is 0 51 m s the schematic plot of this experiment is shown in fig 4 the sediment concentration along profiles 1 4 6 and 7 at the initial time as well as the bed morphology at 7 5 h and 15 0 h were measured in this experiment the numerical simulation for this case is conducted as closely as possible to the parameters of the flume experiment the computational domain is set to 14 m 0 5 m 0 9 m while a non uniform grid system is adopted and the numbers of cells in three directions are 360 40 and 50 respectively and a numerical case of a more refined mesh system with grid numbers 550 60 and 80 is also conducted to check grid dependence using a similar mesh scheme at first only the model s suspension component is switched on while the numerical results for flow velocity and sediment concentration are output to make the comparison in fig 5 subsequently the bed load and morphological variation components are switched on to let the trench evolve with the bed morphology at 7 5 h and 15 h obtained and the comparisons are made with experimental data on the middle cross section in fig 6 from the above comparisons it can be concluded that the performance of this numerical model is essentially invariant under the two different mesh systems suggesting it can accurately reproduce the phenomenon of erosion and deposition under the specified flow conditions with the good agreement obtained in comparison with flume data 3 3 local scour around isolated spur dike zhang 2015 conducted a series of flume studies on the local bed morphology near isolated partially emergent spur dikes at ujigawa open laboratory disaster prevention research institute in kyoto university in the experimental flume a sediment recess located at 4 m downstream from the inlet tank is covered by uniform sediment with median grain size d50 1 03 mm specific gravity 2 65 and the porosity value 0 35 the spur dike is installed in the sediment recess with the size of 0 1 m 0 01 m length thickness and placed at the right side of the flume the water depth is 0 05 m and flow discharge is 0 0057 m3 s the simulation according to the experimental parameters is conducted with this numerical model with the flume length being shortened to 6 m to save computational resources as reported in han et al 2022 in detail three y z cross sections x 0 075 m x 0 0 m x 0 075 m and three x z cross sections y 0 04 m y 0 08 m y 0 12 m are selected with the final bed elevation along the corresponding coordinates on these intersections in present study being compared with zhang s experimental data as well as zhang s numerical results using a euler lagrange two phase flow model in fig 7 from which it can be concluded this numerical model can accurately reproduce the local scour phenomenon around isolated spur dikes furthermore it could even provide much better predictions for the global scouring hole shape than zhang s result which could be clearly seen on the simulation experiment comparison of some particular intersection x 0 075 m 4 results and discussions to investigate the flow properties and sediment motion in grouped spur dikes field with different layout angles the verified numerical model is applied to the normal angled spur dikes case and the downward angled spur dikes case shown in fig 8 which are the most commonly used layout styles in river engineering the length width and height of the numerical flumes for the two cases are both 700 m 40 m 15 m with the bed slope 0 0001 which is generalized from jinjiang river reach in chengdu china zhang et al 2012 four spur dikes have the same size 6 m 6 m 1 8 m for the width height and thickness respectively the sand bed with thickness of 5 m is formed by sediment particles with median grain size d50 0 7 mm the water depth equals 4 0 m while the flow discharge at the upstream is 250 57 m3 s which is determined by the stage discharge relation curve of uniform open channel flow without the spur dikes in present study the non uniform grid system refined around the spur dikes is employed and the grid numbers are 920 70 and 120 in three directions respectively for both of the two cases the grid size is smaller around spur dikes and becomes larger away from spur dikes fig 9 the boundary conditions of specific flow discharge and sediment feed rate are applied at the inlet while the boundary conditions of given water depth and open flow and sediment at the outlet by doing so it is possible to capture the varying water depth in the river channel due to the existence of group spur dikes all the other detailed information in the simulation can be found in fig 8 4 1 flow field at the beginning only the hydrodynamic component is switched on until the flow field getting equilibrium afterwards the sediment component is switched on to calculate the suspension as well as sand bed evolution until obtaining the final bedform equilibrium at the flow equilibrium stage the velocity fields on the representative xy intersections z 2 0 m as well as on the representative xz intersections y 3 0 m and y 37 0 m from the two cases are plotted in fig 10 and fig 11 it could be found fig 10 top figure that the main flow within the spur dikes field of the normal angled spur dikes case follows the path of s shape around the upstream two pairs of spur dikes and then gradually become straight with the accelerated velocity magnitude from upstream to downstream while the process of acceleration is relatively intensive at the upstream spur dikes field but mild at the middle and downstream for easier explanation the eight spur dikes are named with no 1 no 8 along the flow direction because of the s shape main flow the symmetrical axis of each vortex behind the first two spur dikes is not paralleled but having an angle with the sidewall which is not the same as the isolated spur dike case in the vertical direction the xz plane of y 3 0 m and y 37 0 m are taken as the representative sections which is near the side wall and through the middle of every spur dike it can be seen fig 10 bottom figure there is an intense vortex in front of the no 1 and no 2 spur dike digging the sand bed which is same as the isolated spur dike case while a small corner vortex also exists in front of every other spur dike which is relatively obvious at no 3 and no 5 spur dike due to the flow reflected by the no 2 spur dike on the opposite river bank the flow intensity at the back half section between the no 1 and no 3 as well as between no 3 and no 5 spur dikes is fairly strong which may cause the bed erosion on the bed surface there however at the front half section between every pair of spur dikes the flow intensity is relatively weak due to the shelter effect of the upstream spur dike compared with the normal angled spur dikes case the flow field of downward angled spur dikes case has some special features due to the downward layout style the intense vortex in front of each spur dike becomes weak therefore the direct hit on each spur dike by the incident flow is minimized fig 11 top figure in turn the impacts of the spur dikes on the flow are also minimized which makes the acceleration process of velocity magnitude in the spur dikes field is smoother resulting in slowly increasing flow velocity magnitude from upstream to downstream within the grouped spur dikes field it could also be proved by watching the 3d vorticity field of the two cases plotted in fig 12 in which the vorticity magnitude equals 0 5 contours of the downward angled spur dikes case are combined together rather than being separated into pieces by every spur dike in the normal angled case the swing amplitude of the s shaped main flow around the upstream two pairs of spur dikes is less so the flow direction looks straighter than that of the normal angled spur dikes case the flow intensity at the front half section of shelter area between neighboring spur dikes is much weaker than that of the normal angled spur dikes case while it is stronger at the back half section fig 11 bottom figure 4 2 sediment transport the sediment concentrations on the representative xz intersections y 3 0 m and y 37 0 m of these two cases are plotted in fig 13 overall the sediment concentration of the downward angled spur dikes case bottom figure is more uniform and well distributed than that of the normal angled spur dikes case top figure due to the more effective shelter function specifically speaking the main flow as well as the turbulence by the upstream structures take sediment from the sand bed therefore causes the high concentration at the back half section of shelter area in these figures while the sediment is more enriched in front of the downstream spur dikes than the upstream ones which finally deposits on the bed there or comes into the main flow after obtain the equilibrium state the bed elevations of these two cases are plotted in fig 14 it could be seen that the bed erosion is also s shape around the front two sets of spur dikes while the swing amplitude of the s shaped bedform in downward angled spur dikes case right figure is less than that in normal angled spur dikes case left figure which is corresponding to the main flow structure in the channel meanwhile the erosion depth grows as the flow velocity increasing towards downstream which obtain the maximum scour depth around no 2 spur dike of 2 27 m in the normal angled case and 2 51 m in the downward angled case and then decreases as the flow coming out of the grouped spur dike fields it should be noted that the relatively intense corner vortex causes erosion on the sand bed in front of the no 1 and no 2 spur dike for the normal angled case while the erosions are not that much in front of the rest spur dikes where the corner vortexes are weak there is also a relatively intense scouring area near the sidewall downstream away from the spur dikes field in the downward angled spur dikes case due to the meandering of main flow which needs to be carefully treated in engineering application 4 3 affecting factors on maximum scour depth in practical engineering the maximum scour depth and its position are always of interest for hydrological investigators which could also offer guidance to structure safety and protection projects therefore to obtain a more comprehensive recognition of the relationship between these affecting factors and the maximum scour depth in spur dikes field a series of numerical cases are conducted with the layout angles ranged from 30⁰ to 90⁰ and sediment grain size d50 ranged from 0 35 mm to 1 5 mm changed under the same flow condition as previous cases while the layout angles ranged from 30⁰ to 90⁰ and froude number ranged from 0 15 to 0 8 by changing the combinations of flow discharge and channel slope varied with the same sediment grain size 0 0007 m as previous cases and the maximum scour depths with their coordinates are shown in table 1 and table 2 respectively based on the data in table 1 the relationship curves of the maximum scour depth with the layout angle and mean grain size are plotted in fig 15 it can be found the maximum scour depths reduce as the layout angles increasing for a certain sediment grain size d50 while the slopes of the relationship curves decrease with the grain sizes become larger which means for a river with larger sediment grain size the maximum scour depth varies more slowly with the layout angles change fig 15 left figure meanwhile for a certain layout angle the maximum scour depths also reduce as the sediment grain sizes increasing while the slopes of the relationship curves decrease with the layout angles become larger which means for a spur dikes field with larger layout angle the maximum scour depth varies less rapidly with the sediment grain sizes change fig 15 right figure the locations of the maximum scour depth are getting close to the spur dikes as the layout angles and the sediment grain size increasing with the application of the les module the numerical model could not only predict the final bed elevation but also reproduce the dynamic process of local scour formation which means that this model has the capability to provide the scour depth at any time fig 16 shows the generation and developing process of maximum scour depth for the six sets of numerical cases in d3 catalog including d 1 case and d 2 case with different layout angles and same flow and sediment condition in table 1 from the six curves with different colors which represent the maximum scour depth varying with time it could be observed that the erosion process is relatively intensive in the first 80 h in these cases in which the scour intensity is gradually weaken until it approaches the equilibrium state while 80 of maximum scour depth is obtained within half of the whole scouring time it should be noted that the time consuming to obtain the 80 of maximum scour depth in these cases becomes longer as the layout angle grows which means the spur dikes field with smaller layout angle may get to the equilibrium state sooner as the same the relationship curves of the maximum scour depth with the layout angle and froude number are plotted in fig 17 based on the data in table 2 it can be found the maximum scour depths reduce as the layout angles increasing for a certain froude number while the slopes of the relationship curves increase with the froude number become larger which means for a river with larger froude number the maximum scour depth varies more rapidly with the layout angles change fig 17 left figure meanwhile for a certain layout angle the maximum scour depths increase as the froude number becomes larger fig 17 right figure the locations of the maximum scour depth are moving close to the spur dikes as the layout angles and the froude number increasing 4 4 dynamic calculation for the natural river the flood crest caused by rainstorm in flood season usually makes damage to the spur dikes through abrupt sediment erosion and bed scouring to better understand the mechanism of this phenomenon simulations of flood crest moving through the normal angled spur dikes field and the 45⁰ downward angled spur dikes field are conducted while the flood is created by dam break at upstream inlet in the simulation and the crest is 2 3 m above the water level when approaching the grouped spur dikes field which could be found from the hydrograph of discharge and the water level close to the first spur dike in fig 18 the flow field and sediment contour at four intermediate time are presented in fig 19 and fig 20 the transparent isosurface on the top indicates the water surface and the color of the velocity vector represents its magnitude the 3d nontransparent isosurface beneath the water surface in the right figure indicates the sediment contour created by the flood crest interacting with the spur dikes from this two figures it could be found that the moving flood crest will cause extremely large flow velocity and strong turbulence around the spur dikes with the maximum local flow velocity 4 52 m s while severe water surface oscillation occurs in the vicinity leading to the abruptly intensive sediment erosion from the sand bed than usual with maximum instantaneous sediment concentration being 8370 ppm taking large amount of sediment into the main flow and moving them downstream which circumstance needs to be paid attention specially in engineering application 5 conclusion in this study a three dimensional numerical model is introduced and applied to study the flow motion and local scour in grouped spur dikes field with different layout angles the adoption of porous medium method pmm lets this model could be conducted on a cartesian coordinate system which makes the numerical discretization and difference more convenient to perform resulting to a relatively easy modeling process the good agreements of the verification cases imply that this model can be applied to further engineering practices on structure fluid sediment interaction the similarities and differences can both be found from the comparison of flow fields between the normal angled spur dikes case and the downward angled spur dikes case fully 3d characteristics shows in both two cases while the main flow follows unique path for each case and the large scale vortexes behind the spur dikes form recirculation zone meanwhile the complicated distribution of suspended load and non uniform erosion and deposition on sand bed are caused by flow motion in both cases the maximum scour depth in the normal angled spur dikes case is smaller than that of the other case through the additional cases with ranged layout angles sediment grain sizes and froude number the negative correlation shows between the maximum scour depths and the layout angles as well as between the maximum scour depths and the sediment grain sizes while the positive correlation shows between the maximum scour depths

2827,the flow properties sediment moving and geomorphology in the grouped spur dikes field have always been of interest in river engineering in this paper a 3d numerical model is employed to investigate the flow motion and riverbed scouring around grouped spur dikes with different layout angle styles series of flume experiments are introduced to verify this model s reliability before its application on the simulation of the downward angled spur dikes case and normal angled spur dikes case respectively and detailed comparative analyses on the flow intensity vortex patterns and local scour are made for these two layout angle styles respectively in which the similarities and differences could both be found then the influence of flow conditions sediment parameters and spur dike layout angles on the maximum scour depth and their coordinates are discussed through additional simulations while the different correlations show between the maximum scour depths with these three factors then the simulation of flood passage through the spur dike fields is conducted which could not only provide river hydrological information but also offer guidance for the hydraulic structure safety keywords 3d numerical model grouped spur dikes layout angle flow motion local scour data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the spur dikes are commonly used in medium scale river engineering for the purposes of channel realignment environmental protection and ecological conservation as a result the flow motion and sediment transport in the vicinity have always been hot research issues for river hydrology however the complexity of these problems cannot be neglected flow separation and circumfluence behind the spur dikes result in strongly 3d turbulence which directly affect the sediment transport and local scour around the spur dike and the eventual balance are reached as flow and sediment strongly coupled with each other therefore most researchers especially in early stage usually conduct studies on isolated spur dike case rather than grouped spur dikes tingsanchali and maheswaran 1990 mayerle et al 1995 molls et al 1995 ouillon and dartus 1997 kuhnle et al 1999 kuhnle et al 2008 nakagawa et al 2004 nagata et al 2005 mccoy et al 2007 mccoy et al 2008 duan 2009 koken and constantinescu 2009 koken and constantinescu 2011 yu et al 2010 kang et al 2011b peng et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 khosronejad et al 2013 khosronejad et al 2014 however it is more practical that the spur dikes are constructed in group for various engineering needs which is also known as the grouped spur dikes field in engineering projects fig 1 the motion of flow and sediment would be more complicated in this kind of system because of the interaction between these spur dikes therefore although the achievements on isolated spur dike cases can provide fairly useful references further studies on the fluid motion and sediment transport in grouped spur dikes system are still needed compared with the studies of the isolated spur dike the research on grouped spur dike is much insufficient while flume experiment and field measurement are the main methods and the research systematicness is also relatively poor bahar and fukuoka 1999 uijttewaal et al 2001 muto et al 2003 engelhardt et al 2004 mccoy et al 2006 mccoy et al 2007 mccoy et al 2008 constantinescu et al 2009 yossef and huib 2010 kang et al 2011a gu et al 2011 karami et al 2014 furthermore majority of these studies focus on the spur dikes perpendicular to one side wall in experimental flumes rather than those of practical applications symmetrically placed in waterways which are commonly with downward layout angles fig 2 under these circumstances the knowledge of how the flow properties and local scour respond to the variation of spur dikes layout angles mostly comes from the field observations in engineering practices instead of scientific analyses which leaves the hydrological investigators lots of unsolved questions kuhnle et al 2002 sukhodolov et al 2002 cuong et al 2019 jafari and sui 2021 therefore we illustrate an application of a 3d numerical model on studying the influence of spur dikes layout angles on flow motion and sediment transport around them this numerical platform named newtank has already been successfully used on a variety of hydrodynamic cases for the past two decades lin and li 2003 gu et al 2005 liu and lin 2008 lin et al 2016 han et al 2022 the introduction of porous medium method pmm in present model version allows the structure like spur dikes as well as the complex bed forms can be conducted with the same numerical method in the rectangle mesh system resulting in the model building procedure being much more convenient in present study we introduce the model firstly and then present verifications against flume experiments to test the model s reliability afterwards this model is applied to investigate the flow motion and local scour of spur dikes fields with two different layout types in which the detailed 3d flow field sediment motion and riverbed scouring are obtained then the maximum scour depths along with their coordinates in extended flow sediment and layout angle conditions are analyzed for engineering purpose while the simulation of flood passage through the spur dike fields is conducted to study the dynamic process of sediment transport and scour development under an unsteady flow condition 2 numerical methodology the present numerical model can be divided into a hydrodynamic component and a sediment component detailed description of which had already been made in han et al 2018 han et al 2022 so only some vital governing equations are illustrated in this part the motion of incompressible fluid within and outside porous medium can be described by the modified navier stokes equations karunarathna and lin 2006 lin and karunarathna 2007 1 u i x i 0 2 1 n u i t u j n 2 u i x j 1 ρ p 0 x i ν n 2 u i x j x j f i 1 n 2 u i u j x j where u i is the spatially averaged flow velocity in the i direction p0 is the effective pressure and ρ ν and n are fluid density fluid kinematic viscosity and effective porosity respectively the force f i is caused by the presence of porous material which includes inertia and drag forces f i f ii f di the concept of two phase flow is employed in this model a scalar transport equation of volume of fluid vof function f is solved to determine the volumetric fraction of water in all cells while the three dimensional plic vof gueyffier et al 1999 method is used to reconstruct the interface and to determine the vof fluxes in all computational cells 3 f t u i f x i 0 with the help of the vof function the density of fluid can be rewritten as ρ f ρ w 1 f ρ a where the subscripts w and a denote water and air respectively in the present model large eddy simulation les is introduced to capture turbulence transport and dissipation after being filtered by the spatial filter top hat function the sub grid stress terms appear in the momentum equations can be modeled by the smagorinsky sub grid scale model smagorinsky 1963 4 τ ij 1 3 τ kk δ ij 2 ρ ν t u i x j u j x i where ν t c s δ 2 s is the eddy viscosity cs is the smagorinsky coefficient δ δ x δ y δ z 3 is the filter size calculated by the control volume δxδyδz the dynamic smagorinsky model germano et al 1991 is embedded into the original smagorinsky model by letting the parameter cdyn evolve in time and space as a function of the flow field with the help of parameters obtained from the hydrodynamic component as well as the velocity components and bed shear stress at the near wall nodes calculated by applying the wall function khosronejad et al 2013 the control equation of sediment transport could then be resolved the suspended load concentration is calculated by the advection diffusion equation from which the volumetric concentration c can be calculated across the whole computational domain 5 c t x i u i c w s δ j 3 c ε si 2 c x i 2 where u i is the flow velocity calculated from the hydrodynamic component and εsi is the sediment mixing coefficient which relates to the fluid mixing coefficient van rijn 1984 abdel fattah et al s relation abdel fattah et al 2004 is introduced to describe the bed load transport rate 6 q b 0 053 s 1 g d 50 3 t 2 1 d 0 3 t 3 0 100 s 1 g d 50 3 t 1 5 d 0 3 t 3 where d50 is the median grain size of sediment t is the non dimensional excess shear stress and d is the non dimensional grain size while the effects of bed slope on critical shear stress and bed load transport rate are also taken into account in this model van rijn 1993 the morphological variation is calculated based on the sediment mass balance equation 7 1 λ p η t d a e a q bx x q by y where λp is the porosity of bed η is the bed elevation qbx and qby are the bed load transport rates in the and y directions da and ea are the deposition and entrainment rates respectively which can be evaluated from 8 e a 0 015 w s d 50 a t 1 5 d 0 3 9 d a w s c a where a is a reference level and ca is the effective boundary concentration at that level this numerical model is constructed on a non uniform cartesian coordinate system a staggered grid system is adopted which means that scalars are defined at cell centers and vectors are defined at the centers of cell faces 3 model verification 3 1 isolated spur dike with fixed bed series of flume experiments on the isolated spur dike with fixed bed were carried out in the state key laboratory of hydraulic and mountain river engineering of sichuan university and the partially emergent spur dike case is numerically simulated with the computational domains and flow conditions being identical to those of the experimental test which has been reported in han et al 2022 in detail the numerical results of flow field over a 300 s time window were compared to the experimental data taken by piv with the same averaging window since recirculation behind the spur dike forms a vortex in the time averaged computational domain the xy plane z 0 05 m is found to provide a good representation of the flow field therefore series of lines on this plane along which the coordinate is constant x 20 mm x 40 mm x 80 mm x 160 mm x 240 mm x 480 mm are chosen a comparison of flow velocity magnitude varying with the y coordinate along these lines between numerical results and experimental data is drawn in fig 3 and fairly good agreement shows which demonstrates that the present numerical model can accurately capture the flow field and reproduce the vortexes formed around the spur dike 3 2 trench evolution under open channel flow since the erosion and deposition play a significant role in developing bed morphology the experimental test for evolution of a trench under open channel flow van rijn 1993 is employed here to test the capability of this model on accurately reproducing these two processes the flume is 30 m 0 5 m 0 7 m for the length width and height respectively the sediment particles on sand bed have median grain size d50 0 16 mm and sand of the same size and composition is fed at the upstream inlet to so as to maintain the just equilibrium state the water depth equals 0 39 m and the roughness height is 0 025 m while the flow velocity at the flume inlet is 0 51 m s the schematic plot of this experiment is shown in fig 4 the sediment concentration along profiles 1 4 6 and 7 at the initial time as well as the bed morphology at 7 5 h and 15 0 h were measured in this experiment the numerical simulation for this case is conducted as closely as possible to the parameters of the flume experiment the computational domain is set to 14 m 0 5 m 0 9 m while a non uniform grid system is adopted and the numbers of cells in three directions are 360 40 and 50 respectively and a numerical case of a more refined mesh system with grid numbers 550 60 and 80 is also conducted to check grid dependence using a similar mesh scheme at first only the model s suspension component is switched on while the numerical results for flow velocity and sediment concentration are output to make the comparison in fig 5 subsequently the bed load and morphological variation components are switched on to let the trench evolve with the bed morphology at 7 5 h and 15 h obtained and the comparisons are made with experimental data on the middle cross section in fig 6 from the above comparisons it can be concluded that the performance of this numerical model is essentially invariant under the two different mesh systems suggesting it can accurately reproduce the phenomenon of erosion and deposition under the specified flow conditions with the good agreement obtained in comparison with flume data 3 3 local scour around isolated spur dike zhang 2015 conducted a series of flume studies on the local bed morphology near isolated partially emergent spur dikes at ujigawa open laboratory disaster prevention research institute in kyoto university in the experimental flume a sediment recess located at 4 m downstream from the inlet tank is covered by uniform sediment with median grain size d50 1 03 mm specific gravity 2 65 and the porosity value 0 35 the spur dike is installed in the sediment recess with the size of 0 1 m 0 01 m length thickness and placed at the right side of the flume the water depth is 0 05 m and flow discharge is 0 0057 m3 s the simulation according to the experimental parameters is conducted with this numerical model with the flume length being shortened to 6 m to save computational resources as reported in han et al 2022 in detail three y z cross sections x 0 075 m x 0 0 m x 0 075 m and three x z cross sections y 0 04 m y 0 08 m y 0 12 m are selected with the final bed elevation along the corresponding coordinates on these intersections in present study being compared with zhang s experimental data as well as zhang s numerical results using a euler lagrange two phase flow model in fig 7 from which it can be concluded this numerical model can accurately reproduce the local scour phenomenon around isolated spur dikes furthermore it could even provide much better predictions for the global scouring hole shape than zhang s result which could be clearly seen on the simulation experiment comparison of some particular intersection x 0 075 m 4 results and discussions to investigate the flow properties and sediment motion in grouped spur dikes field with different layout angles the verified numerical model is applied to the normal angled spur dikes case and the downward angled spur dikes case shown in fig 8 which are the most commonly used layout styles in river engineering the length width and height of the numerical flumes for the two cases are both 700 m 40 m 15 m with the bed slope 0 0001 which is generalized from jinjiang river reach in chengdu china zhang et al 2012 four spur dikes have the same size 6 m 6 m 1 8 m for the width height and thickness respectively the sand bed with thickness of 5 m is formed by sediment particles with median grain size d50 0 7 mm the water depth equals 4 0 m while the flow discharge at the upstream is 250 57 m3 s which is determined by the stage discharge relation curve of uniform open channel flow without the spur dikes in present study the non uniform grid system refined around the spur dikes is employed and the grid numbers are 920 70 and 120 in three directions respectively for both of the two cases the grid size is smaller around spur dikes and becomes larger away from spur dikes fig 9 the boundary conditions of specific flow discharge and sediment feed rate are applied at the inlet while the boundary conditions of given water depth and open flow and sediment at the outlet by doing so it is possible to capture the varying water depth in the river channel due to the existence of group spur dikes all the other detailed information in the simulation can be found in fig 8 4 1 flow field at the beginning only the hydrodynamic component is switched on until the flow field getting equilibrium afterwards the sediment component is switched on to calculate the suspension as well as sand bed evolution until obtaining the final bedform equilibrium at the flow equilibrium stage the velocity fields on the representative xy intersections z 2 0 m as well as on the representative xz intersections y 3 0 m and y 37 0 m from the two cases are plotted in fig 10 and fig 11 it could be found fig 10 top figure that the main flow within the spur dikes field of the normal angled spur dikes case follows the path of s shape around the upstream two pairs of spur dikes and then gradually become straight with the accelerated velocity magnitude from upstream to downstream while the process of acceleration is relatively intensive at the upstream spur dikes field but mild at the middle and downstream for easier explanation the eight spur dikes are named with no 1 no 8 along the flow direction because of the s shape main flow the symmetrical axis of each vortex behind the first two spur dikes is not paralleled but having an angle with the sidewall which is not the same as the isolated spur dike case in the vertical direction the xz plane of y 3 0 m and y 37 0 m are taken as the representative sections which is near the side wall and through the middle of every spur dike it can be seen fig 10 bottom figure there is an intense vortex in front of the no 1 and no 2 spur dike digging the sand bed which is same as the isolated spur dike case while a small corner vortex also exists in front of every other spur dike which is relatively obvious at no 3 and no 5 spur dike due to the flow reflected by the no 2 spur dike on the opposite river bank the flow intensity at the back half section between the no 1 and no 3 as well as between no 3 and no 5 spur dikes is fairly strong which may cause the bed erosion on the bed surface there however at the front half section between every pair of spur dikes the flow intensity is relatively weak due to the shelter effect of the upstream spur dike compared with the normal angled spur dikes case the flow field of downward angled spur dikes case has some special features due to the downward layout style the intense vortex in front of each spur dike becomes weak therefore the direct hit on each spur dike by the incident flow is minimized fig 11 top figure in turn the impacts of the spur dikes on the flow are also minimized which makes the acceleration process of velocity magnitude in the spur dikes field is smoother resulting in slowly increasing flow velocity magnitude from upstream to downstream within the grouped spur dikes field it could also be proved by watching the 3d vorticity field of the two cases plotted in fig 12 in which the vorticity magnitude equals 0 5 contours of the downward angled spur dikes case are combined together rather than being separated into pieces by every spur dike in the normal angled case the swing amplitude of the s shaped main flow around the upstream two pairs of spur dikes is less so the flow direction looks straighter than that of the normal angled spur dikes case the flow intensity at the front half section of shelter area between neighboring spur dikes is much weaker than that of the normal angled spur dikes case while it is stronger at the back half section fig 11 bottom figure 4 2 sediment transport the sediment concentrations on the representative xz intersections y 3 0 m and y 37 0 m of these two cases are plotted in fig 13 overall the sediment concentration of the downward angled spur dikes case bottom figure is more uniform and well distributed than that of the normal angled spur dikes case top figure due to the more effective shelter function specifically speaking the main flow as well as the turbulence by the upstream structures take sediment from the sand bed therefore causes the high concentration at the back half section of shelter area in these figures while the sediment is more enriched in front of the downstream spur dikes than the upstream ones which finally deposits on the bed there or comes into the main flow after obtain the equilibrium state the bed elevations of these two cases are plotted in fig 14 it could be seen that the bed erosion is also s shape around the front two sets of spur dikes while the swing amplitude of the s shaped bedform in downward angled spur dikes case right figure is less than that in normal angled spur dikes case left figure which is corresponding to the main flow structure in the channel meanwhile the erosion depth grows as the flow velocity increasing towards downstream which obtain the maximum scour depth around no 2 spur dike of 2 27 m in the normal angled case and 2 51 m in the downward angled case and then decreases as the flow coming out of the grouped spur dike fields it should be noted that the relatively intense corner vortex causes erosion on the sand bed in front of the no 1 and no 2 spur dike for the normal angled case while the erosions are not that much in front of the rest spur dikes where the corner vortexes are weak there is also a relatively intense scouring area near the sidewall downstream away from the spur dikes field in the downward angled spur dikes case due to the meandering of main flow which needs to be carefully treated in engineering application 4 3 affecting factors on maximum scour depth in practical engineering the maximum scour depth and its position are always of interest for hydrological investigators which could also offer guidance to structure safety and protection projects therefore to obtain a more comprehensive recognition of the relationship between these affecting factors and the maximum scour depth in spur dikes field a series of numerical cases are conducted with the layout angles ranged from 30⁰ to 90⁰ and sediment grain size d50 ranged from 0 35 mm to 1 5 mm changed under the same flow condition as previous cases while the layout angles ranged from 30⁰ to 90⁰ and froude number ranged from 0 15 to 0 8 by changing the combinations of flow discharge and channel slope varied with the same sediment grain size 0 0007 m as previous cases and the maximum scour depths with their coordinates are shown in table 1 and table 2 respectively based on the data in table 1 the relationship curves of the maximum scour depth with the layout angle and mean grain size are plotted in fig 15 it can be found the maximum scour depths reduce as the layout angles increasing for a certain sediment grain size d50 while the slopes of the relationship curves decrease with the grain sizes become larger which means for a river with larger sediment grain size the maximum scour depth varies more slowly with the layout angles change fig 15 left figure meanwhile for a certain layout angle the maximum scour depths also reduce as the sediment grain sizes increasing while the slopes of the relationship curves decrease with the layout angles become larger which means for a spur dikes field with larger layout angle the maximum scour depth varies less rapidly with the sediment grain sizes change fig 15 right figure the locations of the maximum scour depth are getting close to the spur dikes as the layout angles and the sediment grain size increasing with the application of the les module the numerical model could not only predict the final bed elevation but also reproduce the dynamic process of local scour formation which means that this model has the capability to provide the scour depth at any time fig 16 shows the generation and developing process of maximum scour depth for the six sets of numerical cases in d3 catalog including d 1 case and d 2 case with different layout angles and same flow and sediment condition in table 1 from the six curves with different colors which represent the maximum scour depth varying with time it could be observed that the erosion process is relatively intensive in the first 80 h in these cases in which the scour intensity is gradually weaken until it approaches the equilibrium state while 80 of maximum scour depth is obtained within half of the whole scouring time it should be noted that the time consuming to obtain the 80 of maximum scour depth in these cases becomes longer as the layout angle grows which means the spur dikes field with smaller layout angle may get to the equilibrium state sooner as the same the relationship curves of the maximum scour depth with the layout angle and froude number are plotted in fig 17 based on the data in table 2 it can be found the maximum scour depths reduce as the layout angles increasing for a certain froude number while the slopes of the relationship curves increase with the froude number become larger which means for a river with larger froude number the maximum scour depth varies more rapidly with the layout angles change fig 17 left figure meanwhile for a certain layout angle the maximum scour depths increase as the froude number becomes larger fig 17 right figure the locations of the maximum scour depth are moving close to the spur dikes as the layout angles and the froude number increasing 4 4 dynamic calculation for the natural river the flood crest caused by rainstorm in flood season usually makes damage to the spur dikes through abrupt sediment erosion and bed scouring to better understand the mechanism of this phenomenon simulations of flood crest moving through the normal angled spur dikes field and the 45⁰ downward angled spur dikes field are conducted while the flood is created by dam break at upstream inlet in the simulation and the crest is 2 3 m above the water level when approaching the grouped spur dikes field which could be found from the hydrograph of discharge and the water level close to the first spur dike in fig 18 the flow field and sediment contour at four intermediate time are presented in fig 19 and fig 20 the transparent isosurface on the top indicates the water surface and the color of the velocity vector represents its magnitude the 3d nontransparent isosurface beneath the water surface in the right figure indicates the sediment contour created by the flood crest interacting with the spur dikes from this two figures it could be found that the moving flood crest will cause extremely large flow velocity and strong turbulence around the spur dikes with the maximum local flow velocity 4 52 m s while severe water surface oscillation occurs in the vicinity leading to the abruptly intensive sediment erosion from the sand bed than usual with maximum instantaneous sediment concentration being 8370 ppm taking large amount of sediment into the main flow and moving them downstream which circumstance needs to be paid attention specially in engineering application 5 conclusion in this study a three dimensional numerical model is introduced and applied to study the flow motion and local scour in grouped spur dikes field with different layout angles the adoption of porous medium method pmm lets this model could be conducted on a cartesian coordinate system which makes the numerical

jeong et al 2018 it is believed that only rock that contains illite smectite kaolinite or chlorite clays can have significant fines migration feia et al 2015 chequer et al 2021 during flow the attached fines are subjected to electrostatic force gravity drag and lift bedrikovetsky et al 2011 russell et al 2018 the particle mechanical equilibrium on pore scale comprises the conditions of the

bedrikovetsky 2014 substitution of lever arm ratio l n l d into eq 2 instead of friction coefficient μ f makes eqs 1 and 2 mathematically equivalent fines detachment by either of eq 1 or 2 corresponds to minimum between two constants lever arm ratio and friction coefficient finally fine particle is mobile if the attaching torque due to electrostatic force and gravity is exceeded by the detaching torque due to drag and lift where eq 1 is using minimum of l n l d and μ f nguyen et al 2013 wang et al 2021 on the core scale the kinetics of fines detachment is described by the relaxation equation where the detachment rate is proportional to the attached concentration rasmuson et al 2019 lin et al 2021 sasidharan et al 2021 here the proportionality detachment coefficient k det is an empirical parameter which is determined from the laboratory corefloods another detachment model is based on the mechanical equilibrium eqs 1 to 3 which determine detaching conditions for the fluid flow over attached particle for the overall ensemble of particle and rock surface properties bedrikovetsky et al 2011 bedrikovetsky et al 2012 the attached concentration becomes a function of all parameters

transport in porous media bedrikovetsky et al 2019 yuan and moghanloo 2019 yang et al 2022c in the case of delayed particle detachment due to molecular nernst plank diffusion of ions in the contact particle substrate area both detachment models are equivalent russell and bedrikovetsky 2018 mohammadi et al 2020 pourakaberian et al 2022 the mobilized fines are strained in the rock s pore throat causing clogging water injection experiments performed on rock that contains clay have shown a permeability decline of 60 to 90 hussain et al 2013 yu et al 2018 clogging can also be caused by swelling of clays such as smectite konikow et al 2001 okaikue woodi et al 2020 and chlorite churchman 1980 tao et al 2019 when exposed to water in addition clay flocculation and deflocculation can occur due to disruption of electrostatic forces bishop 1997 bennion et al 2000 suspended fines in injected water and microbial growth are considered to be the leading sources of clogging in carbonate rocks fetzer et al 2017 wang et al 2020 cui et al 2021 clogging caused by filtration of suspended fines is greatly affected by fines concentration size of suspended fines and pore size distribution in the rock jeong et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 to study clogging due to microbial growth injected water is premixed with microbes or with nutrients that support microbial growth lappan and fogler 1992 wang et al 2020 observed that rock permeability was reduced by 70 after 28 h of injecting water containing suspended fines but this reduction was reached after only 3 h when bacteria were also injected indicating the strong influence of microbial growth on clogging mineral reactions such as carbonate dissolution cause pore enlargement song et al 2020 however dissolution leads to increased permeability or unclogging rather than clogging clogging can occur if dissolved minerals precipitate at a later stage because quantifying clogging due to precipitation is difficult in the laboratory this mechanism is usually studied using numerical or analytical models youngs et al 2009 zhang et al 2020 precipitation due to mineral reactions had not been considered a significant mechanism for clogging pavelic et al 2007 martin 2013 jeong et al 2018 however some modelling and laboratory studies have demonstrated that carbonate mineral reactions induce additional mechanisms that cause significant permeability decrease ge et al 2020 luhmann et al 2013 wang et al 2021 2022 liu et al 2020 used the darcy brinkman approach liu et al 2007 to model grains redistribution due to carbonate dissolution they demonstrated that grains redistribution can cause a permeability decrease of as much as 95 however they did not validate their results with laboratory experiments zahid et al 2012 conducted flooding experiments to investigate the effect of low salinity water injection in limestone and chalk samples they observed ca ions in the effluent samples and increased pressure difference across the core they attributed the increased pressure difference to fines migration but they did not provide any direct evidence of fines migration noiriel et al 2007 observed detachment of clay fines due to carbonate dissolution some of these clay fines were observed to partially block fracture openings however their study did not consider grain redistribution and blockage attributable to fines other than clays mineral dissolution and precipitation reactions in natural rocks occur during water injection into carbonate and sandstone reservoirs during numerous water management and storage processes lasaga 1998 geochemical rock dissolution in water due to ionic strength and ph difference between the reservoir and injected waters highly depends on the relaxation time for the dissolution chemical reaction and equilibrium mineral concentration in water altree williams et al 2018 the analytical model allows determining both constants from the lab tests yielding high match between the experimental and modelling data the dissolution is also highly sensitive to the area of solid liquid interface altree williams et al 2019 1d flow problem with varying interface area is essentially non linear but also allows for exact solution it allows determining the interface area from the coreflood data on breakthrough concentrations and porosity variation the mathematical construction allows for extension of multicomponent rock dissolution reactions geochemical mineral precipitation reactions occur where the formation and injected waters are incompatible containing the ions that create insoluble salts during the mixing lasaga 1998 usually solid deposits yield significant permeability decrease the mathematical model contains two empirical parameters chemical reaction and formation damage permeability reduction coefficients under permeability reduction both constants can be determined from the laboratory corefloods using pressure measurements only vaz et al 2016 large concentrations of deposited solids during geochemical mineral precipitation reactions yield the dependency for chemical reaction coefficient of deposit concentration here the non linear 1d flow problem allows for exact solution yang et al 2022a however characterization of geochemical flow system in this case requires breakthrough concentrations of reacting species on top of the pressure measurements yang et al 2022b in this study we experimentally investigate whether in situ fines migration and grains redistribution induced by mineral reaction can cause significant clogging in carbonate aquifers 2 materials and methods to focus on mineral reaction our experiment is designed to preclude the other previously cited mechanisms for clogging 1 air entrainment was prevented by deairing the water 2 in situ clay migration or clay swelling was precluded by using rock that contains no clay 3 suspended fines in injected water were avoided by filtering the water 4 microbial

properties of the injection fluids section 2 2 characterizes the rock that receives the injections section 2 3 presents the experimental procedure 2 1 fluid properties deaerated milliqtm water was used to prepare fluids for injection and saturating the rock the milliq machine was fitted with a 0 22 μm pes polyethersulfone asymmetric membrane filter although the water was deaired using a vacuum pump some co2 might have been dissolved in water which might affect the ph of the injection water czernichowski lauriol et al 2006 synthetic seawater having a salinity of 44 580 mg l was used to saturate the rock and for further injection we adopted the synthetic seawater composition from yousef et al 2012 and chandrasekhar et al 2016 the salts listed in the first column of table 2 were used to prepare various concentrations of synthetic seawater henceforth referred to as seawater to create two more injection fluids seawater was mixed with deaerated milliqtm water in proportions 1 2 referred to as 3 times diluted seawater and 1 5 referred to as 6 times diluted seawater the properties of the injected fluids are presented in appendix b 1 our study used salinities that are typical in water disposal for less saline fluids typical of mar and asr table 1 seawater 3 times diluted and 6 times diluted seawater injection are common in water disposal deionized water injection is common in mar and asr projects 2 2 rock characterization one edwards brown and one indiana limestone cylindrical core sample each having diameter 2 5 cm and length 5 cm were used in the injection experiment the porosities of the edwards brown core sample and the indiana limestone core sample were measured as 42 and 17 respectively the permeabilities of the edwards brown core sample and the indiana limestone core sample were measured as 75 and 63 md respectively the measured porosity and permeability values matched the values provided by the vendor of the core samples kocurek industries https kocurekindustries com carbonates cores the edwards brown core sample is from the edwards plateau formation located in texas usa the edwards plateau is an uplift of gently dipping strata composed primarily of early cretaceous carbonate rocks which primarily consist of limestone and dolomite barker et al 1994 the indiana limestone core sample is from the salem formation located in indiana usa the salem formation is comprised mainly of limestone oolite fossiliferous and argillaceous limestone and the formation dates from the mississippian meramecian series howe and koenig 1961 in addition to the core samples 5 g of powdered edwards brown and of powdered indiana limestone were used to run x ray powder diffraction xrd and x ray fluorescence xrf analyses the xrd pattern was recorded using an empyrean supplier panalytical bv fitted with a cobalt source highscore plus software with an icdd pdf 4 data base was used to perform crystalline candidate search match a rietveld refinement fit

intrusion porosimetry was performed on additional samples of the edwards brown and indiana limestone appendix a approximately 55 of the pore space in the edwards brown was composed of 5 μm or larger pores and almost 35 of the pore space was composed of 0 1 μm or smaller pores the indiana limestone was more heterogeneous having pore sizes ranging from 0 02 to 200 μm 2 3 experimental procedure the experimental setup is described in appendix b 2 the following procedure was conducted for each experimental run a take images of the injection and production surfaces of a dry core sample to record

brown core sample four of the effluent samples during deionized water injections were found turbid in steps j through l subsequent analysis proceeded as follows the turbid effluent samples were split into two equal parts one part was analyzed by steps m and n the other part was mixed with concentrated nitic acid to dissolve produced fines these acidized water samples were then subjected to icp oes analysis which was used to identify the types and concentration of solid fines in the turbid effluent samples 3 results this section presents the experimental results from two core samples section 3 1

pore scale sem eds imaging analysis section 3 4 characterizes the produced fines 3 1 permeability fines concentration and ph measurement clogging in this study is presented as the ratio of measured permeability k to initial permeability k0 the initial permeability k0 is the measured permeability at the beginning of the first salinity stage a permeability ratio less than 1 signifies clogging permeability is calculated using 4 k q μ l a δ p where q is the injection rate μ is water viscosity l is the length of the plug a is the area of the cross section of the plug and δp is the recorded pressure difference across a given plug initial permeability k0 is calculated using the initial δp in eq 4 initial permeability was 75 mdarcy for the edwards brown and 65 mdarcy for indiana limestone core samples fig 2 a presents the permeability ratio of the edwards brown core sample the permeability ratio decreased to 55 during seawater injection however permeability increased during 3 times diluted seawater injection from 55 to 67 and during 6 times diluted seawater injection from 67 to 110 these observations of the permeability ratio can be explained as follows as seawater injection started mechanical equilibrium of fines present in the rock was disturbed causing fines to migrate and yielding a permeability decrease chequer and bedrikovetsky 2019 however such fines migration was observed only for the first 4 pvi of the seawater injection fig 2c produced fines concentration was insignificant during the remainder of seawater injection and during 3 times diluted and 6 times diluted seawater injections the permeability increase during 3 times diluted and 6 times diluted seawater injections was due to dolomite dissolution eq 5 5 camg c o 3 2 2 h 2 o c a 2 m g 2 2 h c o 3 2 o h dissolution of dolomite produces hydroxyl ions oh which increased the ph of the water from 5 6 to 6 7 during the first 4 pvi of 3 times diluted seawater injection after which the ph reduced and then stabilized fig 2c similarly the ph increased from 5 6 to 6 3 during the first 5 pvi of 6 times diluted seawater injection after which the ph reduced and then stabilized during deionized water injection ph increased to 10 fig 2c which shows significantly more dolomite dissolution than during previous injection stages chen et al 2020 and mehraban et al 2021 also observed a ph increase up to 10 during water injection into carbonate this dolomite dissolution dislodged fines causing a spike in produced fines concentration during deionized water injection fig 2b due to excessive fines production turbid effluent samples were collected during the first 7 pvi of deionized water injection fig 2b some of the mobilized fines blocked the pore space yielding a permeability decrease from 62 mdarcy to 0 5 mdarcy at 3 pvi of deionized water injection 76 cumulative pvi fig 2a after 3 pvi of deionized water injection extensive pore blockage caused the pressure difference to reach the upper limit of the pressure transducer refer to appendix b 2 the experiment was suspended while a larger range pressure transducer was installed the final permeability was 1 15 mdarcy constituting a 99 9 decrease from the initial permeability the final permeability might have been even lower had the experimental run been continuous for the indiana limestone core sample the permeability decreased continuously from the initial value of 65 mdarcy to 21 mdarcy fig 3 a the decrease in permeability ratio from its initial value reached 29 during seawater injection 54 during 3 times diluted seawater injection 58 during 6 times diluted seawater injection and 67 during deionized water injection the final permeability represented a decrease of 67 from its initial value which is significantly less than the 99 9 decrease for the edwards brown core sample the same was observed for produced fines concentration fig 3b the indiana limestone experimental run also exhibited an increase in ph which was caused by the dissolution of calcite eq 6 6 cac o 3 h 2 o c a 2 h c o 3 o h the ph trend during the indiana limestone experimental run fig 3c was similar to that for edwards brown the measured ph of the effluent samples was between 6 and 7 during the first three stages in contrast the measured ph during deionized water injection increased to 9 followed by a decrease and stabilization at 8 3 2 chemistry of effluent samples fig 4 presents the icp oes results of the filtered effluent samples for the edwards brown core sample the concentrations of ca mg na sulfate k and silica were detected for seawater injection the concentrations of ca mg na sulfate and k in the effluent samples were similar to those in the injected fluid in contrast the first reading during 3 times diluted and 6 times diluted seawater injections was higher than the injected concentration because of 1 mixing between the injected fluid and higher salinity water in the core sample and 2 mineral reactions being that fluid mixing would have completed within 1 pvi high mineral concentrations in the first effluent samples of 3 times diluted seawater injection taken at 2 pvi and of 6 times diluted seawater injection taken at 2 5 pvi must have been due to mineral reactions this would also account for the increased ph observed at the corresponding pvi for those two seawater fluids fig 2c during deionized water injection the concentration of ca and mg declined until 3 pvi 76 cumulative pvi from that moment an increase in these concentrations was observed which correlates with the increase in produced fines concentration fig 2b and ph fig 2c at the corresponding pvi after 76 cumulative pvi the concentration of ca and mg decreased and stabilized trends that also correlate with produced fines concentration fig 2b and ph fig 2c at the corresponding pvi these observations suggest that dolomite dissolution eq 5 occurred during deionized water injection which led to an increase in ph the average mass ratio of ca to mg in effluent samples during deionized water injection was 1 8 however dissolution of dolomite eq 5 should result in the ratio 1 65 studies confirm that the average mass ratio of ca to mg can be greater than 1 65 due to slower release rate of mg than of ca at the same conditions zhang et al 2007 khather et al 2017 othman et al 2019 dolomite forms the grains and intergranular cement the dissolution of the grain s surface would release fines that were previously attached to the surface so the dissolution of the grain s surface or intergranular cement would lead to an increase in produced fines concentration produced concentrations of na k and sulfate were also observed during deionized water injection the adsorption of such elements can occur during high salinity injection zhang et al 2006 srisuriyachai and meekangwal 2017 awolayo et al 2018 depicted the adsorption of na and k respectively by 7 2 n a c a x 2 2 n a x c a 2 8 2 k c a x 2 2 k x c a 2 where x represents the surface minerals present in the rock nguyen et al 2020 several studies have reported adsorption reactions in carbonate rocks zhang et al 2006 srisuriyachai and meekangwal 2017 mosallanezhad and kalantariasl 2021 carbonate rocks contain negatively and positively charged surfaces therefore both cations and anions or a fine with a surface charge can be adsorbed on the carbonate surface mosallanezhad and kalantariasl 2021 several literature studies conducted on sandstones and soil samples have associated adsorption or desorption reactions to mobilization of fines lebedeva and senden 2009 in particular when deionized water is injected after na ca exchange reaction eq 7 has occurred large concentration of fines is mobilized as the electrostatic force is reduced bradford and kim 2010 the reversible adsorption reactions also lead to ph change by gaining or losing h ions lager et al 2008 therefore the ph increase observed in our experiments might be caused by both adsorption and dissolution reactions silica was observed during all stages even though it was not present in the injected fluids it was likely produced because of mineral reaction of silicates present in the rock de silva et al 2015 raza et al 2016 mineral reaction can cause subsequent precipitation of some of the minerals yielding a decrease in permeability pavelic et al 2007 to assess whether precipitation could occur in our experiment we estimated the equilibrium concentration of ca and mg during deionized water injection using phreeqc software parkhurst and appelo 2013 once the concentration of an element is equal to its equilibrium concentration the rates of dissolution and precipitation become equal denbigh 1981 the equilibrium concentration for ca was 5 4 mg l and for mg was 1 7 mg l which are comparable to the produced concentrations of these elements during deionized water injection fig 4 a and b therefore precipitation likely occurred in the edwards brown core sample mahani et al 2015b also suggested the precipitation or dissolution state by comparing the equilibrium concentration calculated by phreeqc and produced concentrations measured by icp oes analysis table 5 presents the icp oes results of four turbid water samples produced from 3 to 7 pvi of deionized water injection 76 and 80 cumulative pvi the produced fines were largely composed of ca mg k silica al and fe likely dolomite calcite quartz silicate or iron oxide table 3 which is evident from the larger concentrations of these elements in effluent samples this result suggests that some of the solids might be dolomite because of the presence of ca and mg but a significant quantity of silicates fines was produced the icp oes results for the indiana limestone core sample show that for seawater injection the produced concentrations of ca mg na sulfate and k were similar to their injected concentrations again high initial concentrations of these elements during 3 times diluted and 6 times diluted seawater injection correlate with the increase in ph at the respective pvi fig 3c during the deionized water injection the production of ca was due to calcite dissolution eq 6 because the main dissolution process eq 5 does not involve mg its concentration became zero after 6 pvi of deionized water injection 116 cumulative pvi the na k and sulfate were likely produced because of desorption zhang et al 2006 srisuriyachai and meekangwal 2017 the concentration of silica was also observed during all stages we also calculated the equilibrium concentration of ca for the indiana limestone core sample during deionized water injection the calculated value 5 4 mg l is comparable to the produced values fig 5 a therefore precipitation likely occurred in the indiana limestone core sample 3 3 pore scale sem eds imaging analysis fig 6 shows sem images of subsections of the injection face of the edwards brown core sample fig 7 shows sem images of subsections of the production face of that core sample minerals in these images were identified using eds spectra that are presented in appendix c the following were observed fines on the rock surface or inside pores in some instances these fines are on the rock surface without blocking the pores fig 6 a and b in other instances fines straining causes pore blockage fig 6 a and b and e and f eds analysis shows that these fines are silicates this further confirms our contention that dissolution of the grain s surface dislodged abundant small silicate fines some of which blocked pores pore blockage due to dolomite grains redistribution fig 6 a and b fig 7 c d e and f this can be attributed to dissolution of intergranular cement which dislodges grains that are then redistributed in the flow direction pore enlargement due to dissolution and mobilization of fines and grains fig 6 g and h fig 7 a and b in some instances the rock surface becomes rough due to the dissolution fig 6 c and d pore blockage at the production face due to precipitation fig 6 g and h which aligns with the observations made in icp oes analysis that the produced concentrations were very close to the equilibrium concentration fig 4 in an sem image precipitation appears as a continuous finely structured coating of mineral on a surface which reduces the pore opening hence precipitation can be differentiated from blockage due to fines the instance shown in fig 6 g and h show precipitation of a bright mineral fig 8 shows sem images of subsections of the injection face of the indiana limestone core sample fig 9 shows sem images of subsections of the production face of that core sample minerals in these images were identified using eds spectra that are presented in appendix d the following were observed pore blockage due to strained calcite grains fig 8 a b c and d or to dolomite grains fig 9 a and b the latter being rare breakage of a cluster of grains instead of individual grains due to dissolution fig 8 c and d disappearance or appearance of calcite grains whose diameter ranges from 20 µm fig 8 c d g and h fig 9 c d g and h to 100 µm fig 8 e and f pore enlargement due to dissolution and mobilization of fines and grains fig 8 g and h pore blockage at the injection face due to precipitation fig 8 e and f fig 9 g and h which aligns with the observations made in icp oes analysis that the produced concentrations were very close to the equilibrium concentration fig 5 3 4 produced fines characterization fig 10 presents the sem images of some of the fines produced during the experiment the mineralogy of the produced fines was identified using eds analysis yu et al 2018 tanaka et al 2020 which is presented in appendix e no produced fines were observed during the first three stages for the edwards brown core sample which matches the produced fines concentration graph fig 2 b the filter membranes from deionized water injection show numerous fines which are predominantly silicates fig 10 a with some dolomite grains fig 10 b and c the presence of ca mg o with si and al in the spectra in figure e 2 to e 3 indicates that the particles were dolomite with silicates after 7 pvi of deionized water injection the membrane appears much cleaner fig 10 d e and f because fewer fines were produced which comports with the lower produced fines concentration fig 10b some of the produced fines indicate absorption of na k or s fig 10 d and e a few iron oxide fines were also observed fig 10f as with the edwards brown core sample the produced fines were also not observed during the first three stages for the indiana limestone core sample during the entire stage of deionized water injection the membrane looks clean because fewer fines were produced which is consistent with the observation of produced fines concentration fig 3b the images show that various types of fines were produced during deionized water injection iron oxide identified by the presence of fe and o in the spectra in figure e 6 and e 7 5 10 μm grains fig 10 g h and i and quartz identified by the presence of si and o in the spectra in figure e 8 10 μm grains fig 10 j and k 4 discussion our results demonstrated that clogging during water injection in carbonate rocks could be caused by mineral reactions that bring about 1 release of fines 2 grains redistribution 3 pore enlargement due to dissolution and 4 pore blockage due to precipitation pore enlargement due to dissolution leads to unclogging increase in permeability whereas the other effects lead to clogging decrease in permeability two types of mineral reactions were identified dissolution and adsorption both of which are reversible further experimentation is needed to identify the impact of individual reactions on clogging sem images of the edwards brown core sample showed silicate fines on the grain s surface fig 1a although these silicate fines form only 0 7 of the rock table 3 they constitute the predominant solid in the effluent samples because these fines are small they would require less force to be dislodged and carried than would the rock grains at the initial stages of deionized water injection the effluent sample is turbid due to high concentration of these fines and production of turbid effluent samples is accompanied by a rapid decline in permeability mineral reaction breaks the bond between the fines and the grain s surface causing them to flow with the injected water for instance fig 6 a b c d e and f fig 7 c d e and f fig 9 a and b these fines are either produced or strained in the rock the latter causing pore blockage indiana limestone does not contain silicate fines hence neither turbid effluent nor rapid decline in permeability was observed this might have contributed to the 99 9 decrease in the permeability of the edward brown core sample in contrast to the lesser decrease of 67 for the indiana limestone core sample grains redistribution was observed for both types of rock mineral reactions dissolve intergranular cement thus dislodging rock grains mineral reactions can also weaken a grain s structure causing breakage of a cluster of grains fig 8 c and d instead of individual grains for the edward brown core sample most of the permeability decline occurred during deionized water injection whereas for the indiana limestone core sample the magnitude of permeability decline was similar for all injected fluids nevertheless for both rocks the rate of mineral reactions was greater during deionized water injection due to the low primary calcium saturation in the water mahani et al 2015a mahani et al 2015b alsada and mackay 2017 this suggests that more clogging can be expected during deionized water injection than during higher salinity water injection several existing or planned real projects involve injection of water having salinity lower than that of the formation water hartog and stuyfzand 2017a the objective of these projects is to either dispose of wastewater or recharge a groundwater aquifer with the increasing demands on water resources from multiple water users and the increased variability of rainfall recharge and increased duration of dry periods mar and asr projects are increasing at new sites around the world and also in the volume of water injected dillon et al 2019 our study shows that mineral reaction induced clogging can hinder such projects consistent with recent studies such as cui et al 2021 in this study mineral reaction was the only mechanism examined for inducing fines migration and grain redistribution further experimentation is needed to analyze the individual and combined effect of other mechanisms such as clay swelling clay flocculation and deflocculation silicate migration due to ionic adsorption and desorption suspended fines in injected water and microbial growth we have not investigated the various parameters that can affect design of a water injection project including pressure temperature flow velocity and the compositions of formation and injection waters therefore the presented results are limited to the experimental conditions the experimental observations should also be modelled using geochemical and groundwater transport models timms and hendry 2008 that incorporate the processes we observed we performed sem eds analysis only on fines larger than 0 45 µm the migration of particles or fines smaller than 0 45 µm might have occurred but experimentally analyzing them is much more complex and difficult than what we have done 5 conclusions this study examined clogging during water injection in carbonate rocks edwards brown and indiana limestone core samples were used in this focused experimental study because they do not contain any clays that generally bring about clogging due to clay migration or swelling in addition the injection fluids were filtered deaired deionized water and synthetic seawater which avoided the clogging mechanisms of air entrainment injected solid fines and bacteria the ratio of core sample permeability to its initial permeability was used as a measure of clogging core samples and effluent samples were characterized to delineate clogging mechanisms to our knowledge this is the first study to provide direct evidence of fines migration and grains redistribution induced by mineral reactions in carbonate rocks the following were the main findings mineral reactions were observed these mineral reactions i dissolved the grain s surface releasing silicate fines a mechanism that accounted for permeability decrease in edward brown sample ii dissolved intergranular cement thereby dislodging the rock grains which were then redistributed a mechanism of permeability decrease in both rocks iii caused pore enlargement due to dissolution of dolomite or calcite and iv caused mineral precipitation all four processes listed above were observed for the edwards brown core sample which led to a 99 9 decrease in its permeability from 75 to 1 15 md or approximately a two order of magnitude reduction most of this permeability decrease occurred during deionized water injection which followed the injection of the various seawater concentrations the indiana limestone core sample did not contain any silicate fines experimental observations confirmed grain redistribution pore enlargement and mineral precipitation which led to a 67 decrease in its permeability from 65 to 21 md or approximately half an order of magnitude reduction the magnitude of permeability decline was similar during each injection stage more experiments should be performed to evaluate the effect of pressure temperature flow velocity and the compositions of formation and injection waters the fines migration and grains redistribution mechanisms identified in this study can have implications for field scale water disposal managed aquifer recharge mar and aquifer storage and recovery asr projects fines migration and grains redistribution induced by mineral reactions can cause clogging which reduces the injection capacity and might therefore incur additional expenses for rehabilitation or replacement of injection bores martin 2013 also highlights the need to consider other clogging mechanisms associated with redox conditions iron oxides and bacteria in addition to geochemical and physical clogging mechanisms the coupled effects of suspended solids and bacteria are known to be major contributors to clogging during mar cui et al 2021 1 operation of injection bores may require periods of groundwater extraction to reduce clogging by solids and bacteria by inverting water circulation or frequent and short duration extraction martin 2013 dillon et al 2019 because mineral reactions are found to be greater during deionized water injection poorly designed mar and asr projects that rely on fluids from reverse osmosis treatment of source waters are expected to result in more severe pore clogging than in water disposal however the risks of clogging could be reduced by ensuring that injection water are geochemically compatible with the rock matrix at the proposed injection site and depth we recommend that to evaluate the risks of clogging for any specific project water disposal asr or mar project experiments should be carried out using actual rock core samples under conditions similar with in situ geochemical and hydraulic conditions for example in situ hydrochemical and hydraulic stress conditions can by simulated by column studies such as a physical model in a geotechnical centrifuge timms and hendry 2008 to simulate processes that occur over months and years within a shorter experimental timeframe the physical and geochemical suitability of injection water could be improved where necessary by pretreatment of injection water mixing waters of different sources or by adjusting deionized water from reverse osmosis water treatment strategies to design suitable injection water could include optimizing injection waters with suitable cation ratios for the target formation ensuring critical concentrations of relevant species such as silica verifying that minerals will remain desaturated during injection and applying relevant metrics such as the membrane filtration index martin 2013 dillon et al 2019 credit authorship contribution statement yamin

2828,water injection into an aquifer is generally motivated by one of three objectives disposal managed aquifer recharge mar or aquifer storage and recovery asr any of these would be undermined if an injection well were to become clogged this paper investigates whether mineral reactions can cause mobilization of fines and rock grains and if so how this would affect clogging injection experiments are performed on edwards brown dolomite and indiana limestone core samples x ray powder diffraction analysis of the rocks shows that no clays are present filtered deaired deionized water and pure salts are used to prepare the injection fluids the core samples are subjected to four sequential injections of fluids at salinities 44 580 mg l referred to as seawater 14 860 mg l 7 430 mg l and 0 mg l deionized water these salinities are selected to represent disposal and less saline fluids to represent mar and asr projects pressure difference is recorded across the core sample at each stage and is used to calculate permeability the effluent samples are collected to characterize produced fines and elements the increase in the ph of the effluent samples suggest mineral reactions which is supported by an increase in the concentration of chemical elements in the effluent samples scanning electron microscopy sem images show pore enlargement due to dissolution and depict pore blockage due to fines migration grains redistribution and mineral precipitation mineral reactions dissolved the grain s surface and intergranular cement releasing silicate fines and rock grains which in turn reduce the permeability of the rock by 68 to 99 9 keywords fines migration mineral reactions permeability damage carbonate aquifers aquifer storage and recovery asr managed aquifer recharge mar water

stuyfzand 2017b water for disposal typically contains a concentration of total dissolved solids tds from 3 000 to 100 000 mg l lawrence et al 1995 jarraya horriche and benabdallah 2020 in contrast water typically injected for mar or for asr projects has a tds of less than 500 mg l kaushal et al 2020 clogging of the injection well or of the pores in the injection formation can greatly reduce the

mineral reactions oberdorfer and peterson 1985 mukhopadhyay et al 2004 air entrainment refers to blockage due to air or other gas bubbles martin 2013 these bubbles are hydrophobic and therefore occupy the center of pores where they restrict the water flow path song et al 2020 field scale experimental and modelling studies have shown that air entrainment may be significant only during early stages of injection loizeau et al 2017 and laboratory studies can be designed to eliminate air entrainment pavelic et al 2007 in situ fines migration refers to migration of fines naturally present in rock jeong et al 2018 it is believed that only rock that contains illite smectite kaolinite or chlorite clays can have significant fines migration feia et al 2015 chequer et al 2021 during flow the attached fines are subjected to electrostatic force gravity drag and lift bedrikovetsky et al 2011 russell et al 2018 the particle mechanical equilibrium on pore scale comprises the conditions of the

force respectively at slow non inertial flows in porous media lift is negligibly smaller than electrostatic attraction and the vertical force detachment criterium is omitted kalantariasl and bedrikovetsky 2014 substitution of lever arm ratio l n l d into eq 2 instead of friction coefficient μ f makes eqs 1 and 2 mathematically equivalent fines detachment by either of eq 1 or 2 corresponds to minimum between two constants lever arm ratio and friction coefficient finally fine particle is mobile if the attaching torque due to electrostatic force and gravity is exceeded by the detaching torque due to drag and lift where eq 1 is using minimum of l n l d and μ f nguyen et al 2013 wang et al 2021 on the core scale the kinetics of fines detachment is described by the relaxation equation where the detachment rate is proportional to the attached concentration rasmuson et al 2019 lin et al 2021 sasidharan et al 2021 here the proportionality detachment coefficient k det is an empirical parameter which is determined from the laboratory corefloods another detachment model is based on the mechanical equilibrium eqs 1 to 3 which determine detaching conditions for the fluid flow over attached particle for the overall ensemble of particle and rock surface properties bedrikovetsky et al 2011 bedrikovetsky et al 2012 the attached concentration becomes a function of all parameters

causing clogging water injection experiments performed on rock that contains clay have shown a permeability decline of 60 to 90 hussain et al 2013 yu et al 2018 clogging can also be caused by swelling of clays such as smectite konikow et al 2001 okaikue woodi et al 2020 and chlorite churchman 1980 tao et al 2019 when exposed to water in addition clay flocculation and deflocculation can occur due to disruption of electrostatic forces bishop 1997 bennion et al 2000 suspended fines in injected water and microbial growth are considered to be the leading sources of clogging in carbonate rocks fetzer et al 2017 wang et al 2020 cui et al 2021 clogging caused by filtration of suspended fines is greatly affected by fines concentration size of suspended fines and pore size distribution in the rock jeong et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 to study clogging due to microbial growth injected water is premixed with microbes or with nutrients that support microbial growth lappan and fogler 1992 wang et al 2020 observed that rock permeability was reduced by 70 after 28 h of injecting water containing suspended fines but this reduction was reached after only 3 h when bacteria were also injected indicating the strong influence of microbial growth on clogging mineral reactions such as carbonate dissolution cause pore enlargement song et al 2020 however dissolution leads to increased permeability or unclogging rather than clogging clogging can occur if dissolved minerals precipitate at a later stage because quantifying clogging due to precipitation is difficult in the laboratory this mechanism is usually studied using numerical or analytical models youngs et al 2009 zhang et al 2020 precipitation due to mineral reactions had not been considered a significant mechanism for clogging pavelic et al 2007 martin 2013 jeong et al 2018 however some modelling and laboratory studies have demonstrated that carbonate mineral reactions induce additional mechanisms that cause significant permeability decrease ge et al 2020 luhmann et al 2013 wang et al 2021 2022 liu et al 2020 used the darcy brinkman approach liu et al 2007 to model grains redistribution due to carbonate dissolution they demonstrated that grains redistribution can cause a permeability decrease of as much as 95 however they did not validate their results with laboratory experiments zahid et al 2012 conducted flooding experiments to investigate the effect of low salinity water injection in limestone and chalk samples they observed ca ions in the effluent samples and increased pressure difference across the core they attributed the increased pressure difference to fines migration but they did not provide any direct evidence of fines migration noiriel et al 2007 observed detachment of clay fines due to carbonate dissolution some of these clay fines were observed to partially block fracture openings however their study did not consider grain redistribution and blockage attributable to fines other than clays mineral dissolution and precipitation reactions in natural rocks occur during water injection into carbonate and sandstone reservoirs during numerous water management and storage processes lasaga 1998 geochemical rock dissolution in water due to ionic strength and ph difference between the reservoir and injected waters highly depends on the relaxation time for the dissolution chemical reaction and equilibrium mineral concentration in water altree williams et al 2018 the analytical model allows determining both constants from the lab tests yielding high match between the experimental and modelling data the dissolution is also highly sensitive to the area of solid liquid interface altree williams et al 2019 1d flow problem with varying interface area is essentially non linear but also allows for exact solution it allows determining the interface area from the coreflood data on breakthrough concentrations and porosity variation the mathematical construction allows for extension of multicomponent rock dissolution reactions geochemical mineral precipitation reactions occur where the formation and injected waters are incompatible containing the ions that create insoluble salts during the mixing lasaga 1998 usually solid deposits yield significant permeability decrease the mathematical model contains two empirical parameters chemical reaction and formation damage permeability reduction coefficients under permeability reduction both constants can be determined from the laboratory corefloods using pressure measurements only vaz et al 2016 large concentrations of deposited solids during geochemical mineral precipitation reactions yield the dependency for chemical reaction coefficient of deposit concentration here the non linear 1d flow problem allows for exact solution yang et al 2022a however characterization of geochemical flow system in this case requires breakthrough concentrations of reacting species on top of the pressure measurements yang et al 2022b in this study we experimentally investigate whether in situ fines migration and grains redistribution induced by mineral reaction can cause significant clogging in carbonate aquifers 2 materials and methods to focus on mineral reaction our experiment is designed to preclude the other previously cited mechanisms for clogging 1 air entrainment was prevented by deairing the water 2 in situ clay migration or clay swelling was precluded by using rock that contains no clay 3 suspended fines in injected water were avoided by filtering the water 4 microbial

properties of the injection fluids section 2 2 characterizes the rock that receives the injections section 2 3 presents the experimental procedure 2 1 fluid properties deaerated milliqtm water was used to prepare fluids for injection and saturating the rock the milliq machine was fitted with a 0 22 μm pes polyethersulfone asymmetric membrane filter although the water was deaired using a vacuum pump some co2 might have been dissolved in water which might affect the ph of the injection water czernichowski lauriol et al 2006 synthetic seawater having a salinity of 44 580 mg l was used to saturate the rock and for further injection we adopted the synthetic seawater composition from yousef et al 2012 and chandrasekhar et al 2016 the salts listed in the first column of table 2 were used to prepare various concentrations of synthetic seawater henceforth referred to as seawater to create two more injection fluids seawater was mixed with deaerated milliqtm water in proportions 1 2 referred to as 3 times diluted seawater and 1 5 referred to as 6 times diluted seawater the properties of the injected fluids are presented in appendix b 1 our study used salinities that are typical in water disposal for less saline fluids typical of mar and asr table 1 seawater 3 times diluted and 6 times diluted seawater injection are common in water disposal deionized water injection is common in mar and asr projects 2 2 rock characterization one edwards brown and one indiana limestone cylindrical core sample each having diameter 2 5 cm and length 5 cm were used in the injection experiment the porosities of the edwards brown core sample and the indiana limestone core sample were measured as 42 and 17 respectively the permeabilities of the edwards brown core sample and the indiana limestone core sample were measured as 75 and 63 md respectively the measured porosity and permeability values matched the values provided by the vendor of the core samples kocurek industries https kocurekindustries com carbonates cores the edwards brown core sample is from the edwards plateau formation located in texas usa the edwards plateau is an uplift of gently dipping strata composed primarily of early cretaceous carbonate rocks which primarily consist of limestone and dolomite barker et al 1994 the indiana limestone core sample is from the salem formation located in indiana usa the salem formation is comprised mainly of limestone oolite fossiliferous and argillaceous limestone and the formation dates from the mississippian meramecian series howe and koenig 1961 in addition to the core samples 5 g of powdered edwards brown and of powdered indiana limestone were used to run x ray powder diffraction xrd and x ray fluorescence xrf analyses the xrd pattern was recorded using

intrusion porosimetry was performed on additional samples of the edwards brown and indiana limestone appendix a approximately 55 of the pore space in the edwards brown was composed of 5 μm or larger

brown core sample four of the effluent samples during deionized water injections were found turbid in steps j through l subsequent analysis proceeded as follows the turbid effluent samples were split into two equal parts one part was analyzed by steps m and n the other part was mixed with concentrated nitic acid to dissolve produced fines these acidized water samples were then subjected to icp oes analysis which was used to identify the types and concentration of solid fines in the turbid effluent samples 3 results this section presents the experimental results from two core samples section 3 1

pore scale sem eds imaging analysis section 3 4 characterizes the produced fines 3 1 permeability fines concentration and ph measurement clogging in this study is presented as the ratio of measured permeability k to initial permeability k0 the initial permeability k0 is the measured permeability at the beginning of the first salinity stage a permeability ratio less than 1 signifies clogging permeability is calculated using 4 k q μ l a δ p where q is the injection rate μ is water viscosity l is the length of the plug a is the area of the cross section of the plug and δp is the recorded pressure difference across a given plug initial permeability k0 is calculated using the initial δp in eq 4 initial permeability was 75 mdarcy for the edwards brown and 65 mdarcy for indiana limestone core samples fig 2 a presents the permeability ratio of the edwards brown core sample the permeability ratio decreased to 55 during seawater injection however permeability increased during 3 times diluted seawater injection from 55 to 67 and during 6 times diluted seawater injection from 67 to 110 these observations of the permeability ratio can be explained as follows as seawater injection started mechanical equilibrium of fines present in the rock was disturbed causing fines to migrate and yielding a permeability decrease chequer and bedrikovetsky 2019 however such fines migration was observed only for the first 4 pvi of the seawater injection fig 2c produced fines concentration was insignificant during the remainder of seawater injection and during 3 times diluted and 6 times diluted seawater injections the permeability increase during 3 times diluted and 6 times diluted seawater injections was due to dolomite dissolution eq 5 5 camg c o 3 2 2 h 2 o c a 2 m g 2 2 h c o 3 2 o h dissolution of dolomite produces hydroxyl ions oh which increased the ph of the water from 5 6 to 6 7 during the first 4 pvi of 3 times diluted seawater injection after which the ph reduced and then stabilized fig 2c similarly the ph increased from 5 6 to 6 3 during the first 5 pvi of 6 times diluted seawater injection after which the ph reduced and then stabilized during deionized water injection ph increased to 10 fig 2c which shows significantly more dolomite dissolution than during previous injection stages chen et al 2020 and mehraban et al 2021 also observed a ph increase up to 10 during water injection into carbonate this dolomite dissolution dislodged fines causing a spike in produced fines concentration during deionized water injection fig 2b due to excessive fines production turbid effluent samples were collected during the first 7 pvi of deionized water injection fig 2b some of the mobilized fines blocked the pore space yielding a permeability decrease from 62 mdarcy to 0 5 mdarcy at 3 pvi of deionized water injection 76 cumulative pvi fig 2a after 3 pvi of deionized water injection extensive pore blockage caused the pressure difference to reach the upper limit of the pressure transducer refer to appendix b 2 the experiment was suspended while a larger range pressure transducer was installed the final permeability was 1 15 mdarcy constituting a 99 9 decrease from the initial permeability the final permeability might have been even lower had the experimental run been continuous for the indiana limestone core sample the permeability decreased continuously from the initial value of 65 mdarcy to 21 mdarcy fig 3 a the decrease in permeability ratio from its initial value reached 29 during seawater injection 54 during 3 times diluted seawater injection 58 during 6 times diluted seawater injection and 67 during deionized water injection the final permeability represented a decrease of 67 from its initial value which is significantly less than the 99 9 decrease for the edwards brown core sample the same was observed for produced fines concentration fig 3b the indiana limestone experimental run also exhibited an increase in ph which was caused by the dissolution of calcite eq 6 6 cac o 3 h 2 o c a 2 h c o 3 o h the ph trend during the indiana limestone experimental run fig 3c was similar to that for edwards brown the measured ph of the effluent samples was between 6 and 7 during the first three stages in contrast the measured ph during deionized water injection increased to 9 followed by a decrease and stabilization at 8 3 2 chemistry of effluent samples fig 4 presents the icp oes results of the filtered effluent samples for the edwards brown core sample the concentrations of ca mg na sulfate k and silica were detected for seawater injection the concentrations of ca mg na sulfate and k in the effluent samples were similar to those in the injected fluid in contrast the first reading during 3 times diluted and 6 times diluted seawater injections was higher than the injected concentration because of 1 mixing between the injected fluid and higher salinity water in the core sample and 2 mineral reactions being that fluid mixing would have completed within 1 pvi high mineral concentrations in the first effluent samples of 3 times diluted seawater injection taken at 2 pvi and of 6 times diluted seawater injection taken at 2 5 pvi must have been due to mineral reactions this would also account for the increased ph observed at the corresponding pvi for those two seawater fluids fig 2c during deionized water injection the concentration of ca and mg declined until 3 pvi 76 cumulative pvi from that moment an increase in these concentrations was observed which correlates with the increase in produced fines concentration fig 2b and ph fig 2c at the corresponding pvi after 76 cumulative pvi the concentration of ca and mg decreased and stabilized trends that also correlate with produced fines concentration fig 2b and ph fig 2c at the corresponding pvi these observations suggest that dolomite dissolution eq 5 occurred during deionized water injection which led to an increase in ph the average mass ratio of ca to mg in effluent samples during deionized water injection was 1 8 however dissolution of dolomite eq 5 should result in the ratio 1 65 studies confirm that the average mass ratio of ca to mg can be greater than 1 65 due to slower release rate of mg than of ca at the same conditions zhang et al 2007 khather et al 2017 othman et al 2019 dolomite forms the grains and intergranular cement the dissolution of the grain s surface would release fines that were previously attached to the surface so the dissolution of the grain s surface or intergranular cement would lead to an increase in produced fines concentration produced concentrations of na k and sulfate were also observed during deionized water injection the adsorption of such elements can occur during high salinity injection zhang et al 2006 srisuriyachai and meekangwal 2017 awolayo et al 2018 depicted the adsorption of na and k respectively by 7 2 n a c a x 2 2 n a x c a 2 8 2 k c a x 2 2 k x c a 2 where x represents the surface minerals present in the rock nguyen et al 2020 several studies have reported adsorption reactions in carbonate rocks zhang et al 2006 srisuriyachai and meekangwal 2017 mosallanezhad and kalantariasl 2021 carbonate rocks contain negatively and positively charged surfaces therefore both cations and anions or a fine with a surface charge can be adsorbed on the carbonate surface mosallanezhad and kalantariasl 2021 several literature studies conducted on sandstones and soil samples have associated adsorption or desorption reactions to mobilization of fines lebedeva and senden 2009 in particular when deionized water is injected after na ca exchange reaction eq 7 has occurred large concentration of fines is mobilized as the electrostatic force is reduced bradford and kim 2010 the reversible adsorption reactions also lead to ph change by gaining or losing h ions lager et al 2008 therefore the ph increase observed in our experiments might be caused by both adsorption and dissolution reactions silica was observed during all stages even though it was not present in the injected fluids it was likely produced because of mineral reaction of silicates present in the rock de silva et al 2015 raza et al 2016 mineral reaction can cause subsequent precipitation of some of the minerals yielding a decrease in permeability pavelic et al 2007 to assess whether precipitation could occur in our experiment we estimated the equilibrium concentration of ca and mg during deionized water injection using phreeqc software parkhurst and appelo 2013 once the concentration of an element is equal to its equilibrium concentration the rates of dissolution and precipitation become equal denbigh 1981 the equilibrium concentration for ca was 5 4 mg l and for mg was 1 7 mg l which are comparable to the produced concentrations of these elements during deionized water injection fig 4 a and b therefore precipitation likely occurred in the edwards brown core sample mahani et al 2015b also suggested the precipitation or dissolution state by comparing the equilibrium concentration calculated by phreeqc and produced concentrations measured by icp oes analysis table 5 presents the icp oes results of four turbid water samples produced from 3 to 7 pvi of deionized water injection 76 and 80 cumulative pvi the produced fines were largely composed of ca mg k silica al and fe likely dolomite calcite quartz silicate or iron oxide table 3 which is evident from the larger concentrations of these elements in effluent samples this result suggests that some of the solids might be dolomite because of the presence of ca and mg but a significant quantity of silicates fines was produced the icp oes results for the indiana limestone core sample show that for seawater injection the produced concentrations of ca mg na sulfate and k were similar to their injected concentrations again high initial concentrations of these elements during 3 times diluted and 6 times diluted seawater injection correlate with the increase in ph at the respective pvi fig 3c during the deionized water injection the production of ca was due to calcite dissolution eq 6 because the main dissolution process eq 5 does not involve mg its concentration became zero after 6 pvi of deionized water injection 116 cumulative pvi the na k and sulfate were likely produced because of desorption zhang et al 2006 srisuriyachai and meekangwal 2017 the concentration of silica was also observed during all stages we also calculated the equilibrium concentration of ca for the indiana limestone core sample during deionized water injection the calculated value 5 4 mg l is comparable to the produced values fig 5 a therefore precipitation likely occurred in the indiana limestone core sample 3 3 pore scale sem eds imaging analysis fig 6 shows sem images of subsections of the injection face of the edwards brown core sample fig 7 shows sem images of subsections of the production face of that core sample minerals in these images were identified using eds spectra that are presented in appendix c the following were observed fines on the rock surface or inside pores in some instances these fines are on the rock surface without blocking the pores fig 6 a and b in other instances fines straining causes pore blockage fig 6 a and b and e and f eds analysis shows that these fines are silicates this further confirms our contention that dissolution of the grain s surface dislodged abundant small silicate fines some of which blocked pores pore blockage due to dolomite grains redistribution fig 6 a and b fig 7 c d e and f this can be attributed to dissolution of intergranular cement which dislodges grains that are then redistributed in the flow direction pore enlargement due to dissolution and mobilization of fines and grains fig 6 g and h fig 7 a and b in some instances the rock surface becomes rough due to the dissolution fig 6 c and d pore blockage at the production face due to precipitation fig 6 g and h which aligns with the observations made in icp oes analysis that the produced concentrations were very close to the equilibrium concentration fig 4 in an sem image precipitation appears as a continuous finely structured coating of mineral on a surface which reduces the pore opening hence precipitation can be differentiated from blockage due to fines the instance shown in fig 6 g and h show precipitation of a bright mineral fig 8 shows sem images of subsections of the injection face of the indiana limestone core sample fig 9 shows sem images of subsections of the production face of that core sample minerals in these images were identified using eds spectra that are presented in appendix d the following were observed pore blockage due to

concentrations were very close to the equilibrium concentration fig 5 3 4 produced fines characterization fig 10 presents the sem images of some of the fines produced during the experiment the mineralogy of the produced fines was identified using eds analysis yu et al 2018 tanaka et al 2020 which is presented in appendix e no produced fines were observed during the first three stages for the edwards brown core sample which matches the produced fines concentration graph fig 2 b the filter membranes from deionized water injection show numerous fines which are predominantly silicates fig 10 a with some dolomite grains fig 10 b and c the presence of ca mg o with si and al in the spectra in figure e 2 to e 3 indicates that the particles were dolomite with silicates after 7 pvi of deionized water injection the membrane appears much cleaner fig 10 d e and f because fewer fines were produced which comports with the lower produced fines concentration fig 10b some of the produced fines indicate absorption of na k or s fig 10 d and e a few iron oxide fines were also observed fig 10f as with the edwards brown core sample the produced fines were also not observed during the first three stages for the indiana limestone core sample during the entire stage of deionized water injection the membrane looks clean because fewer fines were produced which is consistent with the observation of produced fines concentration fig 3b the images show that various types of fines were produced during deionized water injection iron oxide identified by the presence of fe and o in the

demonstrated that clogging during water injection in carbonate rocks could be caused by mineral reactions that bring about 1 release of fines 2 grains redistribution 3 pore enlargement due to dissolution and 4 pore blockage due to precipitation pore enlargement due to dissolution leads to unclogging increase in permeability whereas the other effects lead to clogging decrease in permeability two types of mineral reactions were identified dissolution and adsorption both of which are reversible further experimentation is needed to identify the impact of individual reactions on clogging sem images of the edwards brown core sample showed silicate fines on the grain s surface fig 1a although these silicate fines form only 0 7 of the rock table 3 they constitute the predominant solid in the effluent samples because these fines are small they would require less force to be dislodged and carried than would the rock grains at the initial stages of deionized water injection the effluent sample is turbid due to high concentration of these fines and production of turbid effluent samples is accompanied by a rapid decline in permeability mineral reaction breaks the bond between the fines and the grain s surface causing them to flow with the injected water for instance fig 6 a b c d e and f fig 7 c d e and f fig 9 a and b these fines are either produced or strained in the rock the latter causing pore blockage indiana limestone does not contain silicate fines hence neither turbid effluent nor rapid decline in permeability was observed this might have contributed to the 99 9 decrease in the permeability of the edward brown core sample in contrast to the lesser decrease of 67 for the indiana limestone core sample grains redistribution was observed for both types of rock mineral reactions dissolve intergranular cement thus dislodging rock grains mineral reactions can also weaken a grain s structure causing breakage of a cluster of grains fig 8 c and d instead of individual grains for the edward brown core sample most of the permeability decline occurred during deionized water injection whereas for the indiana limestone core sample the magnitude of permeability decline was similar for all injected fluids nevertheless for both rocks the rate of mineral reactions was greater during deionized water injection due to the low primary calcium saturation in the water mahani et al 2015a mahani et al 2015b alsada and mackay 2017 this suggests that more clogging can be expected during deionized water injection than during higher salinity water injection several existing or planned real projects involve injection of water having salinity lower than that of the formation water hartog and stuyfzand 2017a the objective of these projects is to either dispose of wastewater or recharge a groundwater aquifer with the increasing demands on water resources from multiple water users and the increased variability of rainfall recharge and increased duration of dry periods mar and asr projects are increasing at new sites around the world and also in the volume of water injected dillon et al 2019 our study shows that mineral reaction induced clogging can hinder such projects consistent with recent studies such as cui et al 2021 in this study mineral reaction was the only mechanism examined for inducing fines migration and grain redistribution further experimentation is needed to analyze the individual and combined effect of other mechanisms such as clay swelling clay flocculation and deflocculation silicate migration due to ionic adsorption and desorption suspended fines in injected water and microbial growth we have not investigated the various parameters that can affect design of a water injection project including pressure temperature flow velocity and the compositions of formation and injection waters therefore the presented results are limited to the experimental conditions the experimental observations should also be modelled using geochemical and groundwater transport models timms and hendry 2008 that incorporate the processes we observed we performed sem eds analysis only on fines larger than 0 45 µm the migration of particles or fines smaller than 0 45 µm might have occurred but experimentally analyzing them is much more complex and difficult than what we have done 5 conclusions this study examined clogging during water injection in carbonate rocks edwards brown and indiana limestone core samples were used in this focused experimental study because they do not contain any clays that generally bring about clogging due to clay migration or swelling in addition the injection fluids were filtered deaired deionized water and synthetic seawater which avoided the clogging mechanisms of air entrainment injected solid fines and bacteria the ratio of core sample permeability to its initial permeability was used as a measure of clogging core samples and effluent samples were characterized to delineate clogging mechanisms to our knowledge this is the first study to provide direct evidence of fines migration and grains redistribution induced by mineral reactions in carbonate rocks the following were the main findings mineral reactions were observed these mineral reactions i dissolved the grain s surface releasing silicate fines a mechanism that accounted for permeability decrease in edward brown sample ii dissolved intergranular cement thereby dislodging the rock grains which were then redistributed a mechanism of permeability decrease in both rocks iii caused pore enlargement due to dissolution of dolomite or calcite and iv caused mineral precipitation all four processes listed above were observed for the edwards brown core sample which led to a 99 9 decrease in its permeability from 75 to 1 15 md or approximately a two order of magnitude reduction most of this permeability decrease occurred during deionized water injection which followed the injection of the various seawater concentrations the indiana limestone core sample did not contain any silicate fines experimental observations confirmed grain redistribution pore enlargement and mineral precipitation which led to a 67 decrease in its permeability from 65 to 21 md or approximately half an order of magnitude reduction the magnitude of permeability decline was similar during each injection stage more experiments should be performed to evaluate the effect of pressure temperature flow velocity and the compositions of formation and injection waters the fines migration and grains redistribution mechanisms identified in this study can have implications for field scale water disposal managed aquifer recharge mar and aquifer storage and recovery asr projects fines migration and grains redistribution induced by mineral reactions can cause clogging which reduces the injection capacity and might therefore incur additional expenses for rehabilitation or replacement of injection bores martin 2013 also highlights the need to consider other clogging mechanisms associated with redox conditions iron oxides and bacteria in addition to geochemical and physical clogging mechanisms the coupled effects of suspended solids and bacteria are known to be major contributors to clogging during mar cui et al 2021 1 operation of injection bores may require periods of groundwater extraction to reduce clogging by solids and bacteria by inverting water circulation or frequent and short duration extraction martin 2013 dillon et al 2019 because mineral reactions are found to be greater during deionized water injection poorly designed mar and asr projects that rely on fluids from reverse osmosis treatment of source waters are expected to result in more severe pore clogging than in water disposal however the risks of clogging could be reduced by ensuring that injection water are geochemically compatible with the rock matrix at the proposed injection site and depth we recommend that to evaluate the risks of clogging for any specific project water disposal asr or mar project experiments should be carried out using actual rock core samples under conditions similar with in situ geochemical and hydraulic conditions for example in situ hydrochemical and hydraulic stress conditions can by simulated by column studies such as a physical model in a geotechnical centrifuge timms and hendry 2008 to simulate processes that occur over months and years within a shorter experimental timeframe the physical and geochemical suitability of injection water could be improved where necessary by pretreatment of injection water mixing waters of different sources or by adjusting deionized water from reverse osmosis water treatment strategies to design suitable injection water could include optimizing injection waters with suitable cation ratios for the target formation ensuring critical concentrations of relevant species such as silica verifying that minerals will remain desaturated during injection and applying relevant metrics such as the membrane filtration index martin 2013 dillon et al 2019 credit authorship contribution statement yamin

2829,estimates of riverine nitrous oxide n2o emissions have great uncertainty partly due to the fact that the data is still sparse for stream sizes and land uses here we determined water dissolved n2o concentration and water air interface n2o flux across the land uses and stream orders in min river basin of southeast china n2o concentrations ranged from 11 1 to 27 4 nmol l increasing from first to eighth order rivers the first and second order streams showed negative n2o flux 0 33 and 0 05 µg m 2h 1 respectively compared to third to eighth order rivers from 0 29 to 2 85 µg m 2h 1 average n2o flux was significantly higher in urban 1 60 µg m 2h 1 and cropland rivers 0 89 µg m 2h 1 than in forest rivers 0 47 µg m 2h 1 which could be due to the main effect of land use was on the nitrogen load indirect n2o emission factor varied between 0 035 and 0 14 across the rivers which decreased from the urban to forest rivers and were lower than the ipcc default value 0 26 n2o concentration and flux were positively correlated with no3 nh4 depth velocity and temperature suggesting the importance of stream surface hydromoprhology to n2o emissions land use indirectly affected n2o flux by affecting water no3 nh4 do doc ph and temperature which could further explain the land use dependence of n2o emissions on water variables high doc no3 ratio 6 was the main factor of n2o sink in the small streams which may be due to the enhanced n2o consumption and low n2o production therefore riverine n2o emissions are highly variable across stream sizes and land uses which are not only increased by inorganic nitrogen load and are also dependent on stream hydraulics and morphology keywords nitrous oxide land use stream order emission factor min river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction although nitrous oxide n2o is a trace greenhouse gas relative to methane ch4 and carbon dioxide co2 it has a global warming potential 265 298 times that of co2 on the 100 year timeframe myhre and shindell 2013 and has received an increasing attention at regional and global scales rivers are the important aquatic ecosystems in terrestrial environments and contribute substantially to global n2o emissions quick et al 2019 yao et al 2020 it is estimated that rivers and estuaries contribute to 20 35 of global anthropogenic n2o emissions and will become increasingly important in global n2o emissions under the climate warming and human activity mosier et al 1998 ravishankara et al 2009 turner et al 2015 hu et al 2016 conversely the climate change induced low flows decreased riverine n2o emissions mostly due to the reduced water surface areas tonina et al 2021 most studies devoted to n2o emissions in mainstream and estuary of major rivers beaulieu et al 2010 yan et al 2012 murray et al 2015 wells et al 2018 li et al 2022 whereas the data remain sparse for small streams tributary and headwaters mulholland et al 2008 mwanake et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 in addition the estimates of global riverine n2o emissions range largely between 32 2 and 2100 ggn2o n yr 1 hu et al 2016 maavara et al 2018 yao et al 2020 marzadri et al 2021 and this great uncertainty could be attributed to the river sizes nitrogen n loading and hydrogeochemical characteristics globally there are 773000 km2 of total water surface area from different size rivers on the earth due to the influences of topography climate vegetation as well as human activity allen and pavelsky 2018 these rivers have different nitrogen n processes and n2o production intensity leading to high spatial and temporal variability of n2o emissions at a regional or global scale hu et al 2016 maavara et al 2018 quick et al 2019 mwanake et al 2019 marzadri et al 2021 estimating the riverine n2o emissions is poorly constrained under climate change and hydrological conditions and for global rivers in particular hu et al 2016 further emphasizing the understanding of mechanisms underlying riverine n2o emissions in river nitrification and denitrification are main processes for n2o production however they contribute differently to n2o emissions depending on the differences in nutrient availability and environmental parameters across the rivers beaulieu et al 2011 harvey et al 2013 marzadri et al 2017 quick et al 2019 hu et al 2021 it is assumed that n2o emissions are enhanced by the high nh4 and no3 concentrations as they can trigger nitrification and denitrification hinshaw and dahlgren 2012 yu et al 2013 quick et al 2019 which are the main pathways of n2o production however complete denitrification contributes to n2o loss in the rivers with high organic carbon and low no3 concentrations quick et al 2019 hu et al 2021 up to date the dependences of riverine n2o emissions on temperature venkiteswaran et al 2014 jason et al 2014 dissolved oxygen levels rosamond et al 2012 jason et al 2014 n loading wells et al 2018 wang et al 2021 carbon availability quick et al 2019 and hydrological conditions cooper et al 2017 tonina et al 2021 have been well understood however these above factors vary strongly between stream orders and are greatly affected by land uses which interact to affect n2o emissions masese et al 2017 mwanake et al 2019 quick et al 2019 although the relationship of n2o emissions with stream order has recently received attention turner et al 2015 marzadri et al 2017 zhang et al 2022 spatial patterns of n2o emissions remain sparse for stream orders and land use at a basin scale garnier et al 2009 mwanake et al 2019 in addition given the high variability of n2o emissions within a river or across rivers the estimates of n2o emissions using functions and n processes may be uncertain marzadri et al 2017 mwanake et al 2019 marzadri et al 2022 in this case more studies are required for the influences of stream sizes and land uses on patterns and magnitudes of n2o emissions because land use nutrient availability stream hydraulics and morphology interact to affect n2o emissions marzadri et al 2022 only in this way can the uncertainty caused by the representative sampled rivers be reduced and the predictability of riverine n2o emissions at a global scale be improved with this in mind we determined n2o concentration and flux across land uses and stream orders in the min river basin of southeast china min river basin is characterized by dense river networks especially in the upper basin which can represent the patterns of n2o emissions in response to the stream orders the main objectives of this study are as follows 1 to characterize the spatial variability of n2o concentration and flux in the min river networks 2 to determine how land use mediates water variables and further affects n2o emissions 3 to gain what is the critical factor driving riverine n2o sink 4 to address the implications of our findings to regional and global river n2o budget this study can provide an additional insight into environmental constraints on riverine n2o inventory in response to stream morphology and human activities 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was carried out in the min river basin of fujian province which is a typical rainfall dominated watershed in subtropical region of eastern china min river has 562 km length and ultimately flows into east china sea fig 1 min river basin drains

higher value in headstream the rainfall patterns vary spatially throughout the basin with a range of 1100 2500 mm yr 1 huang et al 2018 lyu et al 2019 in addition rainfall has a strong temporal variation with rainy seasons occurring from april to september 60 70 of annual rainfall the mean annual temperatures are mostly in a range of 14 2 c in highlands and 20 1 c in lowlands depending on altitude throughout this basin 2 2 field sampling sample collections from the min river basin were performed in july 2021 and 61 river sites were totally sampled based on the dominating sampling reachability comprising land use types and river size categories the river sites were then sampled using a holistic survey approach in which nitrate nitrite dissolved organic carbon doc n2o hydrologic characteristics and water variables were measured rivers were classified into stream order according to strahler system and into three land use types forest n 21 cropland n 33 and urban n 7 here we considered urban to be city town and developed land and cropland to be referred to all agricultural activities the urban and cropland land uses were high land use intensity forest land use was low

second order rivers showed lowest water depths p 0 05 table 1 water velocity varied between 0 02 and 1 26 m s 1 with average value of 0 15 m s 1 water temperature increased greatly from 19 8 to 34 1 c

significantly higher n2o concentrations compared to other order rivers fig 2 n2o fluxes on average varied from 0 33 to 2 85 µg m 2h 1 across the stream orders the first and second order rivers were observed negative n2o fluxes while third to eighth order rivers showed positive n2o fluxes mean n2o fluxes were significantly higher in fifth order than in other order rivers fig 2 n2o concentrations

concentrations have been widely observed for rivers across climates geomorphology hydrological characteristics and land uses baulch et al 2011 hu et al 2016 marzadri et al 2017 mwanake et al 2019 in this study water n2o concentrations ranged greatly from 0 65 to 46 4 nmol l with average value of 15 7 nmol l indicating a strong spatial variability of n2o concentration across the river networks the mean n2o concentration in this study was much lower than the global average 37 5 nmol l hu et al 2016 which could be due to the low n2o inventory in min river basin in addition n2o fluxes ranging between 1 53 and 5 62 µg m 2h 1 suggested that the studied rivers were net sinks and sources of n2o emissions n2o fluxes were lower in min river basin than in most reported rivers table s2 which could be due to that n2o flux determined by boundary model may be underestimated relative to floating chamber especially in the rivers with extremely low n2o concentrations in addition n2o fluxes ranged from 616 to 11691 µg m 2h 1 across the global rivers and the fluxes were extremely higher in beijing and shanghai where large amount of inorganic n from human activities release into the rivers table s2 these results suggest that riverine n2o emissions are highly variable and will be increased by high inorganic n concentrations globally riverine n2o fluxes are observed to vary by dominant land use type with higher flux in agricultural and residential rivers but lower value in forest rivers hu et al 2016 mwanake et al 2019 also reported that riverine n2o fluxes in the mara river basin were related to land uses decreasing significantly from agricultural to forest rivers in the min river basin n2o fluxes varied significantly between land uses tables s3 and s4 ranging on average from 0 47 µg m 2h 1 in forest rivers to 1 60 µg m 2h 1 in urban rivers forest rivers had negative flux because of the low no3 concentration leading to low n2o production and the large n2o consumption fueled by high doc no3 baulch et al 2011 mwanake et al 2019 these differences in n2o fluxes could be due to that the amount of reactants inorganic n is the primary effect of land use on n2o production in rivers marzadri et al 2014 it is noted that the negative n2o flux observed in the forest rivers was not consistent with the result from audet et al 2020 who demonstrated that forest streams were important sources of n2o emissions higher n2o emissions in swedish forest rivers than in min river forest rivers could be attributed to that higher doc and din concentrations in swedish rivers doc 21 vs 1 28 mg l 1 din 0 78 vs 0 32 mg l 1 audet et al 2020 may facilitate denitrification and yield more n2o the differences in n2o fluxes were coincident with no3 concentrations across land uses in the min river basin table 2 indicating that the main effect of land use is the on the enhanced inorganic n load that facilitates the n2o production zhang et al 2020 hu et al 2021 it has been also reported that n2o concentration and flux increased strongly with the increasing nh4 and no3 concentrations in urban river network yu et al 2013 venkiteswaran et al 2014 wang et al 2021 further confirming that inorganic n loading from human activity intensity can result in high n2o emissions from riverine environments stream orders sizes have been also observed to affect the patterns and magnitudes of n2o emissions borges et al 2015 teodoru et al 2015 zhang et al 2022 in min river basin n2o fluxes varied significantly across stream orders p 0 05 tables s3 and s4 which increased from first to fifth order then decreased to eighth order rivers fig 2 the fact that low order rivers first and second had a negative n2o flux means low water n2o concentration relative to atmosphere which could be due to the low no3 concentrations at the basin scale n2o flux responded nonlinearly to stream orders with highest flux observed in fifth order rivers followed by seventh and eighth order rivers fig 3 interestingly the highest n2o flux in the fifth order rivers could be due to that the high water depth low water velocity and high no3 could favor benthic n2o production hinshaw and dahlgren 2012 hu et al 2021 the differences in n2o fluxes in response to stream orders in this study were consistent with teodoru et al 2015 and borges et al 2015 who found higher fluxes in larger rivers of african river basins in contrast turner et al 2015 tonina et al 2021 and zhang et al 2022 reported the opposite patterns of n2o fluxes decreasing from low to high order rivers however no significant influence of stream order on n2o flux was observed in mara river basin which could be due to that nutrients water variables and stream morphology interact to affect n2o emissions mwanake et al 2019 therefore benthic and hyporheic areas vertical turbulence time hydrological connection could be the underlying factors in driving variability of n2o emissions marzadri et al 2017 hu et al 2021 and the relation between river size and n2o flux may not be consistent globally in addition the relationships of geomorphology and stream order with n2o fluxes turner et al 2015 marzadri et al 2017 may be uncertain in projecting n2o emissions in the rivers where are highly impacted by human activities due to that high inorganic n can stimulate n2o production pathways and yield more n2o wells et al 2018 quick et al 2019 li et al 2022 4 2 biogeochemical controls on n2o concentration and flux we found that water no3 nh4 do temperature and doc varied strongly in the min river basin presumably driving the different n2o concentrations and fluxes the in river nitrification and denitrification contribute mainly to n2o emissions beaulieu et al 2011 quick et al 2019 mwanake et al 2019 but their contributions to n2o emissions differed strongly depending on the differences in nutrients availability and do levels it is well known that denitrification can be triggered by high c n ratios in which denitrifiers have high microbial activity and oxygen consumption leading to more n2o yield muholland et al 2008 wang et al 2021 however in min river basin n2o concentration and flux were observed to negatively correlated to doc no3 fig 6 which was in line with mwanake et al 2019 who reported a negative correlation between n2o flux and doc din ratio high c n ratio can trigger complete denitrification responsible for the reduction of n2o to n2 and therefore n2o loss in riverine waters mwanake et al 2019 hu et al 2021 the high doc no3 ratios and low no3 concentrations in forest rivers thus explained low n2o emissions which is in part attributed to the complete denitrification baulch et al 2011 in addition doc din ratio threshold of 20 strauss et al 2002 and 4 6 mwanake et al 2019 can restrain nitrification through competition for inorganic n from heterotrophic bacteria based on the n2o flux in relation to doc no3 we conservatively ascertained a doc no3 threshold of 6 above which nitrification contributes minimally to n2o emissions and n2o flux is expectedly negative in forest rivers fig 5 in cropland and urban rivers denitrification could be the primary process of n2o production because low doc and high no3 conditions can fuel denitrification hu et al 2016 wang et al 2021 the stronger positive correlation between water n2o and no3 concentrations suggests that denitrification is the dominant process of n2o production in cropland and urban rivers the negative correlations observed between the do and n2o concentration and flux in this study also imply a critical role of denitrification in n2o production as low oxygen condition is favorable for denitrification jason et al 2014 quick et al 2019 the positive correlations between n2o and nh4 and no2 could suggest that nitrification may have contributed to parts of n2o production because nitrification nh4 oxidation can produce no2 and n2o yu e al 2013 quick et al 2019 wang et al 2021 the no2 is easily oxidized to no3 thus high water no2 concentration is strongly dependent on high nitrification rate hu et al 2016 agriculture and residents release large amount of nh4 to rivers yu et al 2013 mwanake et al 2019 wang et al 2021 in this study the nh4 concentrations were generally higher in cropland and urban rivers and the concentrations of no2 and no3 were also higher indicating that nitrification and denitrification occur strongly in these rivers in addition aerobic condition mean do 6 0 mg l 1 in cropland and urban rivers may also suggest the importance of nitrification for n2o production because nitrification can be triggered by high nh4 concentrations and therefore yield more n2o cébron et al 2005 yu et al 2013 therefore nitrification and denitrification are the main processes for n2o emissions in cropland and urban rivers while complete denitrification contributes mainly to the n2o sinks in forest rivers the negative correlation between n2o flux and ph suggests that low ph can increase n2o flux because low ph can favor denitrifiers activity and more n2o yield audet et al 2020 n2o flux was also higher in low do rivers which could be explained by that low oxygen is more favorable for denitrification yielding n2o yet the relationship of n2o flux with do is nonlinear jason et al 2014 venkiteswaran et al 2014 relative to other land use rivers forest river had low water temperature mwanake et al 2019 and similar patterns were observed in the min river basin although there was significant correlation between n2o flux and temperature temperature might be not an important factor affecting the variability of n2o emissions in this basin which could be due to that there was lack of seasonal data and the differences in temperature between urban cropland and forest rivers were co variable with the differences in no3 concentrations between them notably land use had strong indirect influence on n2o flux through affecting temperature no3 nh4 do doc and ph fig 7 which may be the underlying mechanisms of land use dependence of n2o emissions in min river basin in addition hydrological characteristics can also affect riverine n2o emissions muholland et al 2008 cooper et al 2017 tonina et al 2021 in this study there were positive correlations between water depth and n2o concentration and flux high water depth is expected to increase n2o concentration and flux mostly due to that large water benthic sediment interface is consistently favorable for the progressive biological processes of nitrification and denitrification muholland et al 2008 high water depth can increase benthic and hyporheic areas vertical turbulence time marzadri et al 2017 hu et al 2021 enhancing the timescale of reactants to nitrification and denitrification and more n2o yield the fifth seventh and eighth order rivers had relatively high water depth where generally led to high n2o concentration and flux it is noted that forest rivers presented low n2o concentration corresponding to shallow water further indicating that water depth may affect n2o production it is well known that water velocity affects water residence time connected to benthic sediment further contributing to great variability of n2o production marzadri et al 2017 hu et al 2021 low water velocity can provide more time for n processes to generate n2o and weak water turbulence can reduce n2o transfer from water to atmosphere favoring n2o retention in waters wells et al 2018 in this case n2o concentration and flux were significantly higher in fifth order rivers where water velocity was lowest in min river basin river width can best predict n2o emissions hinshaw and dahlgren 2012 our results suggested that n2o flux varied strongly across stream orders table s3 but responded nonlinearly to stream order increases fig 3 the stepwise multiple regression analysis demonstrated that no3 depth and velocity were the strong predictors collectedly explaining 58 of the variability of n2o concentration in the min river basin table s5 suggesting that hydrological and water variables control n2o emissions therefore stream morphology has a strong influence on n2o emissions because the characteristics can affect nutrient availability and water variables to the n2o production 4 3 indirect n2o emission factor indirect n2o emission factor ef5r can indicate potential conversion of inorganic n to n2o but the emission factor that solely depend on n concentration may provide misleading predictions especially in the small streams which are a noticeable source of n2o emissions marzadri et al 2022 the ef5r determined in min river basin ranged from 0 002 to 0 488 with two orders of magnitude higher indicating that the conversions of no3 to n2o vary strongly in the river networks mean ef5r was observed to vary across stream orders which was lowest in eighth order rivers 0 035 followed by third 0 078 and fourth order rivers 0 097 only few rivers from first second third and fifth order had the ef5r being larger than the ipcc default value 0 26 the ef5r also differed significantly across land uses with higher value in forest and cropland rivers but lower value in urban rivers the average ef5r in this basin was 0 10 which was lower than the mean ef5r for eqtp rivers 0 17 and was onefold lower than global average 0 22 hu et al 2016 and ipcc default value 0 26 ipcc 2019 this comparison suggests that n2o emissions potential may be lower in min river basin than in other rivers worldwide the ef5r decreased strongly in urban rivers where the inorganic n concentration was highest but the n2o production may respond nonlinearly to the n increases hu et al 2021 wang et al 2021 li et al 2022 therefore the ef5r is very valuable but is not a very good index to predict n2o emissions from the global rivers because n2o emissions are linked to hydromorphology and land use marzadri et al 2017 marzadri et al 2022 it has been demonstrated that ef5r is also affected by hydrological factors and water variables rosamond et al 2012 venkiteswaran et al 2014 hu et al 2016 zhang et al 2022 although there was a weak correlation between ef5r and doc a significantly positive correlation was observed between ef5r and doc no3 ratio table s6 which is consistent with the result of positive relationship between ef5r and doc din ratio for global rivers hu et al 2016 suggesting that a tradeoff between c and n plays a crucial role in regulating n2o production therefore forest rivers had higher ef5r value compared to cropland and urban rivers in min river basin presumably because of extremely low no3 concentrations in the forest rivers although temperature can affect n2o production as an important determinant of nitrification and denitrification venkiteswaran et al 2014 the results of this study suggest that temperature may be not an important factor of the ef5r which could be due to the weak relationship of temperature with ef5r and the lack of seasonal investigation it has been reported that hydrologic characteristics i e discharge velocity depth width have important influences on ef5r by the fact that water residence and vertical turbulence time scales affect n2o yield strongly marzadri et al 2014 marzadri et al 2017 in the min river basin although n2o concentrations positively correlated with water depth and velocity weak correlations were observed between the ef5r and depth and velocity which could be attributed to the cross correlation of stream morphology with no3 turner et al 2015 marzadri et al 2017 further causing a great uncertainty in n2o production these results further enable that ipcc methodology should be refined to adequately consider the interactions of multiple parameters on n2o emission factor rather than only n concentration marzadri et al 2022 4 4 environmental implications at a regional and global scale expressed as per unit river and basin area in min river basin the first to eighth order rivers released a total of 4 38 kg n2o km 2 yr 1 and 0 05 kg n2o km 2 yr 1 respectively to the atmosphere which are 1 2 order of magnitude lower than those from east qinghai tibet plateau eqtp mean 126 kg n2o km 2 yr 1 0 50 kg n2o km 2 yr 1 zhang et al 2022 and river systems worldwide mean 1016 kg n2o kmv2 yr 1 3 84 kg n2o km 2 yr 1 table 4 this compassion indicates that per unit river n2o flux was significantly higher in urban than in pristine rivers because the intensive human activities can facilitate n2o emissions based on total river water area of 676 km2 calculated by arcgis 10 2 version and average n2o flux of 0 50 µg n2o m 2h 1 it is estimated that approximately 3 0 106 g n2o yr 1 from the min river basin was released to atmosphere while was lower than those in most rivers worldwide table 4 low order rivers small streams are generally low n concentrations and shallow water where the n2o production is largely constrained and the produced n2o is immediately released into atmosphere thereby leading to low n2o inventory in the waters the hyporheic exchange in the small streams can also contribute to n2o emissions however we could not address this part marzadri et al 2017 marzadri et al 2022 if the first and second order rivers are excluded negative flux other order rivers had a mean n2o flux of 7 97 kg n2o km 2 yr 1 which is approximately 2 times higher than the acquired areal flux of all stream orders meaning that low order rivers have great potential of n2o sinks in min river basin the water surface area of min river basin approximately consisted for 0 875 of global rivers and streams 773000 km2 allen pavelsky 2018 while disproportionately contributed to 0 014 of global river n2o emissions 378 gg n2o yr 1 yao et al 2020 suggesting that min river networks have low n2o emissions potential the radiative forcing of co2 emissions 22 9 gg co2 yr 1 unpublished data was 29 22 9 0 003 265 a 265 fold higher global warming potential as high as that of n2o emissions which was much lower than that in inland waters of africa 273 borges et al 2015 and higher than that in urban rivers of beijing 2 wang et al 2021 in addition n2o emission in co2 equiv was responsible for 2 4 of total greenhouse gas emissions in min river basin unpublished data ch4 9 8 gg yr 1 in co2 equiv 0 80 0 80 22 9 9 8 100 2 4 this percentage was higher than that of eqtp rivers 0 4 1 0 zhang et al 2022 and the pristine rivers 0 2 1 2 soued et al 2016 borges et al 2019 while lower than that of urban rivers of beijing 14 wang et al 2021 these comparisons suggest that strong human impacted rivers can increase the contribution of n2o to radiative forcing of total greenhouse gas which should be controlled in the climate warming it should be noted that the estimates of these gases emissions from water air interface are probably uncertain the gas transfer velocity k is critical for quantifying gas emissions using thin boundary layer method raymond et al 2012 water flow and turbulence can consistently alter the gas solubility in rivers in particular in the headstreams where river slope and velocity vary strongly and therefore affect k value greatly raymond et al 2012 the estimates of n2o emissions from our studied rivers may be highly uncertain as we did not measure river slope and topography conservatively this study at least can provide n2o dynamics in relation to stream morphology water variables land use as well as their cross correlations the low order streams presented n2o sinks thus the global estimates may not effectively concern this negative part of n2o emissions nor are crucial factors of n2o emissions well known for such rivers this study is a step forward in determining riverine n2o emissions at a basin scale and highlights the patterns and magnitudes of n2o concentration and flux across land uses our finding that water no3 was the best determinant of n2o concentrations and fluxes may also have widespread implications for n2o emissions in other human impacted rivers worldwide therefore upscaling the n2o emissions at the basin scale may be constrained through the limited number of sampling rivers mostly due to the high variability of n2o emissions across riverine ecosystems 5 conclusion n2o concentrations and fluxes were significantly higher in urban and cropland rivers than in forest rivers indicating that the main effect of land use is on the inorganic n load n2o concentrations and fluxes increased from first to eighth order rivers mostly due to the important influence of stream morphology on n2o emissions in addition land use indirectly affected n2o flux by mediating nutrient availability and water variables which may be the underlying mechanisms of land use dependence of n2o emissions in the river networks indirect n2o emission factors in most rivers were lower than the ipcc default value suggesting low n2o emissions potential in the min river basin the in river denitrification and nitrification contributed mainly to n2o emissions in cropland and urban rivers whereas the high doc no3 ratios 6 for small streams could facilitate the complete denitrification to be responsible for the n2o sink in the forest rivers therefore riverine n2o emissions can be increased by high inorganic n load yet the changes are also affected by the hydrogeological characteristics our findings also demonstrate the land use dependence of n2o flux on water variables and underline stream morphology when interpreting environmental controls on n2o flux and upscaling n2o emissions from the reach to

2829,estimates of riverine nitrous oxide n2o emissions have great uncertainty partly due to the fact that the data is still sparse for stream sizes and land uses here we determined water dissolved n2o concentration and water air interface n2o flux across the land uses and stream orders in min river basin of southeast china n2o concentrations ranged from 11 1 to 27 4 nmol l increasing from first to eighth order rivers the first and second order streams showed negative n2o flux 0 33 and 0 05 µg m 2h 1 respectively compared to third to eighth order rivers from 0 29 to 2 85 µg m 2h 1 average n2o flux was significantly higher in urban 1 60 µg m 2h 1 and cropland rivers 0 89 µg m 2h 1 than in forest rivers 0 47 µg m 2h 1 which could be due to the main effect of land use was on the nitrogen load indirect n2o emission factor varied between 0 035 and 0 14 across the rivers which decreased from the urban to forest rivers and were lower than the ipcc default value 0 26 n2o concentration and flux were positively correlated with no3 nh4 depth velocity and temperature suggesting the importance of stream surface hydromoprhology to n2o emissions land use indirectly affected n2o flux by affecting water no3 nh4 do doc ph and temperature which could further explain the land use dependence of n2o emissions on water variables high doc no3 ratio 6 was the main factor of n2o sink in the small streams which may be due to the enhanced n2o consumption and low n2o production therefore riverine n2o emissions are highly variable across stream sizes and land uses which are not only increased by inorganic nitrogen load and are also dependent on stream hydraulics and morphology keywords nitrous oxide land use stream order emission factor min river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction although nitrous oxide n2o is a trace greenhouse gas relative to methane ch4 and carbon dioxide co2 it has a global warming potential 265 298 times that of co2 on the 100 year timeframe myhre and shindell 2013 and has received an increasing attention at regional and global scales rivers are the important aquatic ecosystems in terrestrial environments and contribute substantially to global n2o emissions quick et al 2019 yao et al 2020 it is estimated that rivers and estuaries contribute to 20 35 of global anthropogenic n2o emissions and will become increasingly important in global n2o emissions under the climate warming and human activity mosier et al 1998 ravishankara et al 2009 turner et al 2015 hu et al 2016 conversely the climate change induced low flows decreased riverine n2o emissions mostly due to the reduced water surface areas tonina et al 2021 most studies devoted to n2o emissions in mainstream and estuary of major rivers beaulieu et al 2010 yan et al 2012 murray et al 2015 wells et al 2018 li et al 2022 whereas the data remain sparse for small streams tributary and headwaters mulholland et al 2008 mwanake et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 in addition the estimates of global riverine n2o emissions range largely between 32 2 and 2100 ggn2o n yr 1 hu et al 2016 maavara et al 2018 yao et al 2020 marzadri et al 2021 and this great uncertainty could be attributed to the river sizes nitrogen n loading and hydrogeochemical characteristics globally there are 773000 km2 of total water surface area from different size rivers on the earth due to the influences of topography climate vegetation as well as human activity allen and pavelsky 2018 these rivers have different nitrogen n processes and n2o production intensity leading to high spatial and temporal variability of n2o emissions at a regional or global scale hu et al 2016 maavara et al 2018 quick et al 2019 mwanake et al 2019 marzadri et al 2021 estimating the riverine n2o emissions is poorly constrained under climate change and hydrological conditions and for global rivers in particular hu et al 2016 further emphasizing the understanding of mechanisms underlying riverine n2o emissions in river nitrification and denitrification are main processes for n2o production however they contribute differently to n2o emissions depending on the differences in nutrient availability and environmental parameters across the rivers beaulieu et al 2011 harvey et al 2013 marzadri et al 2017 quick et al 2019 hu et al 2021 it is assumed that n2o emissions are enhanced by the high nh4 and no3 concentrations as they can trigger nitrification and denitrification hinshaw and dahlgren 2012 yu et al 2013 quick et al 2019 which are the main pathways of n2o production however complete denitrification contributes to n2o loss in the rivers with high organic carbon and low no3 concentrations quick et al 2019 hu et al 2021 up to date the dependences of riverine n2o emissions on temperature venkiteswaran et al 2014 jason et al 2014 dissolved oxygen levels rosamond et al 2012 jason et al 2014 n loading wells et al 2018 wang et al 2021 carbon availability quick et al 2019 and hydrological conditions cooper et al 2017 tonina et al 2021 have been well understood however these above factors vary strongly between stream orders and are greatly affected by land uses which interact to affect n2o emissions masese et al 2017 mwanake et al 2019 quick et al 2019 although the relationship of n2o emissions with stream order has recently received attention turner et al 2015 marzadri et al 2017 zhang et al 2022 spatial patterns of n2o emissions remain sparse for stream orders and land use at a basin scale garnier et al 2009 mwanake et al 2019 in addition given the high variability of n2o emissions within a river or across rivers the estimates of n2o emissions using functions and n processes may be uncertain marzadri et al 2017 mwanake et al 2019 marzadri et al 2022 in this case more studies are required for the influences of stream sizes and land uses on patterns and magnitudes of n2o emissions because land use nutrient availability stream hydraulics and morphology interact to affect n2o emissions marzadri et al 2022 only in this way can the uncertainty caused by the representative sampled rivers be reduced and the predictability of riverine n2o emissions at a global scale be improved with this in mind we determined n2o concentration and flux across land uses and stream orders in the min river basin of southeast china min river basin is characterized by dense river networks especially in the upper basin which can represent the patterns of n2o emissions in response to the stream orders the main objectives of this study are as follows 1 to characterize the spatial variability of n2o concentration and flux in the min river networks 2 to determine how land use mediates water variables and further affects n2o emissions 3 to gain what is the critical factor driving riverine n2o sink 4 to address the implications of our findings to regional and global river n2o budget this study can provide an additional insight into environmental constraints on riverine n2o inventory in response to stream morphology and human activities 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was carried out in the min river basin of fujian province which is a typical rainfall dominated watershed in subtropical region of eastern china min river has 562 km length and ultimately flows into east china sea fig 1 min river basin drains an area of 60992 km2 equivalent to 50 of total land area of fujian province agricultural land averages 4 71 of total watershed area with urban and forest contributing 1 86 and 85 3 respectively figure s1 the basin is characterized with dense vegetation comprising evergreen broad leaved forests in low altitude and coniferous forests in high altitude huang et al 2018 there are many mountains in this basin including wuyi mountain jiufeng mountain daiyun mountain qingyun mountain etc river network in this basin is highly dense with water surface area of 676 km2 accounting for 1 12 of the total basin area the rivers in the basin are classified into eight orders according to strahler system mean annual river runoff depths throughout this basin are in a range of 500 1900 mm with generally higher value in headstream the rainfall patterns vary spatially throughout the basin with a range of 1100 2500 mm yr 1 huang et al 2018 lyu et al 2019 in addition rainfall has a strong temporal variation with rainy seasons occurring from april to september 60 70 of annual rainfall the mean annual temperatures are mostly in a range of 14 2 c in highlands and 20 1 c in lowlands depending on altitude throughout this basin 2 2 field sampling sample collections from the min river basin were performed in july 2021 and 61 river sites were totally sampled based on the dominating sampling reachability comprising land use types and river size categories the river sites were then sampled using a holistic survey approach in which nitrate nitrite dissolved organic carbon doc n2o hydrologic characteristics and water variables were measured rivers were classified into stream order according to strahler system and into three land use types forest n 21 cropland n 33 and urban n 7 here we considered urban to be city town and developed land and cropland to be referred to all agricultural activities the urban and cropland land uses were high land use intensity forest land use was low land use intensity which were referred to wells et al 2018 and wells and eyre 2019 these investigated rivers were also classified into first n 13 second n 10 third n 11 fourth n 12 fifth n 6 seventh n

headspaces local ambient air samples at a 1 m height above the water surface were collected with aluminum foil air bags water and air samples were collected in triplicate at each river after sampling

of land use and stream order on n2o flux was performed significant differences of n2o concentration and flux across land uses stream orders no3 concentrations and doc no3 ratios were examined significant post hoc results were tested with tukey s multiple comparison tests using one way anova stepwise multiple regression analysis was conducted to explore the best factors of variability of n2o emissions we used nlme pinheiro 2021 and mass ripley 2021 packages in r we also used structural equation modelling sem to analyze the best model explaining the main water variables causing differences of n2o fluxes among different land uses we fitted the models using sem r package fox et al 2013 and akaike information criterion significant levels for all statistical analyses were p 0 05 and p 0 01 3 results 3 1 hydrological and water variables water depths increased from 0 02 to 6 2 m with a mean of 0 61 m the fifth and seventh order rivers had highest water depths while first and second order rivers showed lowest water depths p 0 05 table 1 water velocity varied between 0 02 and 1 26 m s 1 with average value of 0 15 m s 1 water temperature increased greatly from 19 8 to 34 1 c water ph was in the range of 6 49 8 74 water do varied greatly between 2 73 and 9 22 mg l 1 water nh4 concentrations ranged from 0 01 to 1 82 mg n l 1 water no3 concentrations were one order of magnitude higher than those of no2 ranging from 0 50 to 1 56 mg n l 1 water doc concentrations varied from 0 96 to 1 64 mg l 1 across the stream orders the doc no3 ratios decreased strongly from first to eighth order rivers forest rivers had significantly lower water depth compared to the urban and cropland rivers p 0 05 table 2 water do concentrations were lower but no3 and nh4 concentrations were higher in the urban and cropland rivers than in the forest rivers forest rivers had the significantly lower concentrations of no2 and no3 compared to other land uses water doc no3 ratios were significantly higher in the forest rivers than in the urban and cropland rivers p 0 05 3 2 n2o emissions with stream orders and land uses water n2o concentrations and fluxes across the rivers ranged from 0 65 to 46 4 nmol l and from 1 53 to 5 62 µg m 2h 1 respectively the n2o concentrations on average varied from11 1 to 27 4 nmol l across the stream orders table 1 the fifth order rivers had significantly higher n2o concentrations compared to other order rivers fig 2 n2o fluxes on average varied from 0 33 to 2 85 µg m 2h 1 across the stream orders the first and second order rivers were observed negative n2o fluxes while third to eighth order rivers showed positive n2o fluxes mean n2o fluxes were significantly higher in fifth order than in other order rivers fig 2 n2o concentrations and fluxes responded nonlinearly to the stream orders fig 3 n2o concentrations varied between 13 9 and 33 7 nmol l for urban rivers between 0 65 and 46 4 nmol l for cropland rivers and between 2 62 and 32 3 nmol l for forest rivers table 2 n2o fluxes were in a range of 0 30 4 40 µg m 2h 1for urban rivers 1 53 5 62 µg m 2h 1 for cropland rivers and 2 10 3 81 µg m 2h 1 for forest rivers parts of cropland and forest rivers exhibited negative n2o fluxes but all urban rivers were recorded positive fluxes mean n2o fluxes were positive in urban and cropland rivers while negative in forest rivers however mean n2o concentrations and fluxes were significantly higher in urban and cropland than in forest rivers p 0 001 fig 2 3 3 effects of hydrological and water variables on n2o emissions hydrological and water variables varied significantly driving the high variation in n2o emissions across the min river basin table 3 the ef5r varied significantly across the stream orders p 0 001 and were higher in second fifth first and seven order rivers and lower in eighth order rivers fig 4 a cropland and forest rivers had significantly higher ef5r compared to urban rivers p 0 001 fig 4b there was an overall negative relationship between n2o flux and doc no3 ratio with a threshold occurring at a ratio of 6 0 above which n2o flux was negative fig 5 n2o flux was linearly correlated with water depth temperature no3 and nh4 but negatively correlated with ph and do fig 6 the structural equation models demonstrated that land uses indirectly affected n2o fluxes by modifying water no3 nh4 temperature do and doc which collectedly explained 49 53 of the n2o flux fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 variability of riverine n2o concentration and flux high spatial and temporal variability of n2o concentrations have been widely observed for rivers across climates geomorphology hydrological characteristics and land uses baulch et al 2011 hu et al 2016 marzadri et al 2017 mwanake et al 2019 in this study water n2o concentrations ranged greatly from 0 65 to 46 4 nmol l with average value of 15 7 nmol l indicating a strong spatial variability of n2o concentration across the river networks the mean n2o concentration in this study was much lower than the global average 37 5 nmol l hu et al 2016 which could be due to the low n2o inventory in min river basin in addition n2o fluxes ranging between 1 53 and 5 62 µg m 2h 1 suggested that the studied rivers were net sinks and sources of n2o emissions n2o fluxes were lower in min river basin than in most reported rivers table s2 which could be due to that n2o flux determined by boundary model may be underestimated relative to floating chamber especially in the rivers with extremely low n2o concentrations in addition n2o fluxes ranged from 616 to 11691 µg m 2h 1 across the global rivers and the fluxes were extremely higher in beijing and shanghai where large amount of inorganic n from human activities release into the rivers table s2 these results suggest that riverine n2o emissions are highly variable and will be increased by high inorganic n concentrations globally riverine n2o fluxes are observed to vary by dominant land use type with higher flux in agricultural and residential rivers but lower value in forest rivers hu et al 2016 mwanake et al 2019 also reported that riverine n2o fluxes in the mara river basin were related to land uses decreasing significantly from agricultural to forest rivers in the min river basin n2o fluxes varied significantly between land uses tables s3 and s4 ranging on average from 0 47 µg m 2h 1 in forest rivers to 1 60 µg m 2h 1 in urban rivers forest rivers had negative flux because of the low no3 concentration leading to low n2o production and the large n2o consumption fueled by high doc no3 baulch et al 2011 mwanake et al 2019 these differences in n2o fluxes could be due to that the amount of reactants inorganic n is the primary effect of land use on n2o production in rivers marzadri et al 2014 it is noted that the negative n2o flux observed in the forest rivers was not consistent with the result from audet et al 2020 who demonstrated that forest streams were important sources of n2o emissions higher n2o emissions in swedish forest rivers than in min river forest rivers could be attributed to that higher doc and din concentrations in swedish rivers doc 21 vs 1 28 mg l 1 din 0 78 vs 0 32 mg l 1 audet et al 2020 may facilitate denitrification and yield more n2o the differences in n2o fluxes were coincident with no3 concentrations across land uses in the min river basin table 2 indicating that the main effect of land use is the on the enhanced inorganic n load that facilitates the n2o production zhang et al 2020 hu et al 2021 it has been also reported that n2o concentration and flux increased strongly with the increasing nh4 and no3 concentrations in urban river network yu et al 2013 venkiteswaran et al 2014 wang et al 2021 further confirming that inorganic n loading from human activity intensity can result in high n2o emissions from riverine environments stream orders sizes have been also observed to affect the patterns and magnitudes of n2o emissions borges et al 2015 teodoru et al 2015 zhang et al 2022 in min river basin n2o fluxes varied significantly across stream orders p 0 05 tables s3 and s4 which increased from first to fifth order then decreased to eighth order rivers fig 2 the fact that low order rivers first and second had a negative n2o flux means low water n2o concentration relative to atmosphere which could be due to the low no3 concentrations at the basin scale n2o flux responded nonlinearly to stream orders with highest flux observed in fifth order rivers followed by seventh and eighth order rivers fig 3 interestingly the highest n2o flux in the fifth order rivers could be due to that the high water depth low water velocity and high no3 could favor benthic n2o production hinshaw and dahlgren 2012 hu et al 2021 the differences in n2o fluxes in response to stream orders in this study were consistent with teodoru et al 2015 and borges et al 2015 who found higher fluxes in larger rivers of african river basins in contrast turner et al 2015 tonina et al 2021 and zhang et al 2022 reported the opposite patterns of n2o fluxes decreasing from low to high order rivers however no significant influence of stream order on n2o flux was observed in mara river basin which could be due to that nutrients water variables and stream morphology interact to affect n2o emissions mwanake et al 2019 therefore benthic and hyporheic areas vertical turbulence time hydrological connection could be the underlying factors in driving variability of n2o emissions marzadri et al 2017 hu et al 2021 and the relation between river size and n2o flux may not be consistent globally in addition the relationships of geomorphology and stream order with n2o fluxes turner et al 2015 marzadri et al 2017 may be uncertain in projecting n2o emissions in the rivers where are highly impacted by human activities due to that high inorganic n can stimulate n2o production pathways and yield more n2o wells et al 2018 quick et al 2019 li et al 2022 4 2 biogeochemical controls on n2o concentration and flux we found that water no3 nh4 do temperature and doc varied strongly in the min river basin presumably driving the different n2o concentrations and fluxes the in river nitrification and denitrification contribute mainly to n2o emissions beaulieu et al 2011 quick et al 2019 mwanake et al 2019 but their contributions to n2o emissions differed strongly depending on the differences in nutrients availability and do levels it is well known that denitrification can be triggered by high c n ratios in which denitrifiers have high microbial activity and oxygen consumption leading to more n2o yield muholland et al 2008 wang et al 2021 however in min river basin n2o concentration and flux were observed to negatively correlated to doc no3 fig 6 which was in line with mwanake et al 2019 who reported a negative correlation between n2o flux and doc din ratio high c n ratio can trigger complete denitrification responsible for the reduction of n2o to n2 and therefore n2o loss in riverine waters mwanake et al 2019 hu et al 2021 the high doc no3 ratios and low no3 concentrations in forest rivers thus explained low n2o emissions which is in part attributed to the complete denitrification baulch et al 2011 in addition doc din ratio threshold of 20 strauss et al 2002 and 4 6 mwanake et al 2019 can restrain nitrification through competition for inorganic n from heterotrophic bacteria based on the n2o flux in relation to doc no3 we conservatively ascertained a doc no3 threshold of 6 above which nitrification contributes minimally to n2o emissions and n2o flux is expectedly negative in forest rivers fig 5 in cropland and urban rivers denitrification could be the primary process of n2o production because low doc and high no3 conditions can fuel denitrification hu et al 2016 wang et al 2021 the stronger positive correlation between water n2o and no3 concentrations suggests that denitrification is the dominant process of n2o production in cropland and urban rivers the negative correlations observed between the do and n2o concentration and flux in this study also imply a critical role of denitrification in n2o production as low oxygen condition is favorable for denitrification jason et al 2014 quick et al 2019 the positive correlations between n2o and nh4 and no2 could suggest that nitrification may have contributed to parts of n2o production because nitrification nh4 oxidation can produce no2 and n2o yu e al 2013 quick et al 2019 wang et al 2021 the no2 is easily oxidized to no3 thus high water no2 concentration is strongly dependent on high nitrification rate hu et al 2016 agriculture and residents release large amount of nh4 to rivers yu et al 2013 mwanake et al 2019 wang et al 2021 in this study the nh4 concentrations were generally higher in cropland and urban rivers and the concentrations of no2 and no3 were also higher indicating that nitrification and denitrification occur strongly in these rivers in addition aerobic condition mean do 6 0 mg l 1 in cropland and urban rivers may also suggest the importance of nitrification for n2o production because nitrification can be triggered by high nh4 concentrations and therefore yield more n2o cébron et al 2005 yu et al 2013 therefore nitrification and denitrification are the main processes for n2o emissions in cropland and urban rivers while complete denitrification contributes mainly to the n2o sinks in forest rivers the negative correlation between n2o flux and ph suggests that low ph can increase n2o flux because low ph can favor denitrifiers activity and more n2o yield audet et al 2020 n2o flux was also higher in low do rivers which could be explained by that low oxygen is more favorable for denitrification yielding n2o yet the relationship of n2o flux with do is nonlinear jason et al 2014 venkiteswaran et al 2014 relative to other land use rivers forest river had low water temperature mwanake et al 2019 and similar patterns were observed in the min river basin although there was significant correlation between n2o flux and temperature temperature might be not an important factor affecting the variability of n2o emissions in this basin which could be due to that there was lack of seasonal data and the differences in temperature between urban cropland and forest rivers were co variable with the differences in no3 concentrations between them notably land use had strong indirect influence on n2o flux through affecting temperature no3 nh4 do doc and ph fig 7 which may be the underlying mechanisms of land use dependence of n2o emissions in min river basin in addition hydrological characteristics can also affect riverine n2o emissions muholland et al 2008 cooper et al 2017 tonina et al 2021 in this study there were positive correlations between water depth and n2o concentration and flux high water depth is expected to increase n2o concentration and flux mostly due to that large water benthic sediment interface is consistently favorable for the progressive biological processes of nitrification and denitrification muholland et al 2008 high water depth can increase benthic and hyporheic areas vertical turbulence time marzadri et al 2017 hu et al 2021 enhancing the timescale of reactants to nitrification and denitrification and more n2o yield the fifth seventh and eighth order rivers had relatively high water depth where generally led to high n2o concentration and flux it is noted that forest rivers presented low n2o concentration corresponding to shallow water further indicating that water depth may affect n2o production it is well known that water velocity affects water residence time connected to benthic sediment further contributing to great variability of n2o production marzadri et al 2017 hu et al 2021 low water velocity can provide more time for n processes to generate n2o and weak water turbulence can reduce n2o transfer from water to atmosphere favoring n2o retention in waters wells et al 2018 in this case n2o concentration and flux were significantly higher in fifth order rivers where water velocity was lowest in min river basin river width can best predict n2o emissions hinshaw and dahlgren 2012 our results suggested that n2o flux varied strongly across stream orders table s3 but responded nonlinearly to stream order increases fig 3 the stepwise multiple regression analysis demonstrated that no3 depth and velocity were the strong predictors collectedly explaining 58 of the variability of n2o concentration in the min river basin table s5 suggesting that hydrological and water variables control n2o emissions therefore stream morphology has a strong influence on n2o emissions because the characteristics can affect nutrient availability and water variables to the n2o production 4 3 indirect n2o emission factor indirect n2o emission factor ef5r can indicate potential conversion of inorganic n to n2o but the emission factor that solely depend on n concentration may provide misleading predictions especially in the small streams which are a noticeable source of n2o emissions marzadri et al 2022 the ef5r determined in min river basin ranged from 0 002 to 0 488 with two orders of magnitude higher indicating that the conversions of no3 to n2o vary strongly in the river networks mean ef5r was observed to vary across stream orders which was lowest in eighth order rivers 0 035 followed by third 0 078 and fourth order rivers 0 097 only few rivers from first second third and fifth order had the ef5r being larger than the ipcc default value 0 26 the ef5r also differed significantly across land uses with higher value in forest and cropland rivers but lower value in urban rivers the average ef5r in this basin was 0 10 which was lower than the mean ef5r for eqtp rivers 0 17 and was onefold lower than global average 0 22 hu et al 2016 and ipcc default value 0 26 ipcc 2019 this comparison suggests that n2o emissions potential may be lower in min river basin than in other rivers worldwide the ef5r decreased strongly in urban rivers where the inorganic n concentration was highest but the n2o production may respond nonlinearly to the n increases hu et al 2021 wang et al 2021 li et al 2022 therefore the ef5r is very valuable but is not a very good index to predict n2o emissions from the global rivers because n2o emissions are linked to hydromorphology and land use marzadri et al 2017 marzadri et al 2022 it has been demonstrated that ef5r is also affected by hydrological factors and water variables rosamond et al 2012 venkiteswaran et al 2014 hu et al 2016 zhang et al 2022 although there was a weak correlation between ef5r and doc a significantly positive correlation was observed between ef5r and doc no3 ratio table s6 which is consistent with the result of positive relationship between ef5r and doc din ratio for global rivers hu et al 2016 suggesting that a tradeoff between c and n plays a crucial role in regulating n2o production therefore forest rivers had higher ef5r value compared to cropland and urban rivers in min river basin presumably because of extremely low no3 concentrations in the forest rivers although temperature can affect n2o production as an important determinant of nitrification and denitrification venkiteswaran et al 2014 the results of this study suggest that temperature may be not an important factor of the ef5r which could be due to the weak relationship of temperature with ef5r and the lack of seasonal investigation it has been reported that hydrologic characteristics i e discharge velocity depth width have important influences on ef5r by the fact that water residence and vertical turbulence time scales affect n2o yield strongly marzadri et al 2014 marzadri et al 2017 in the min river basin although n2o concentrations positively correlated with water depth and velocity weak correlations were observed between the ef5r and depth and velocity which could be attributed to the cross correlation of stream morphology with no3 turner et al 2015 marzadri et al 2017 further causing a great uncertainty in n2o production these results further enable that ipcc methodology should be refined to adequately consider the interactions of multiple parameters on n2o emission factor rather than only n concentration marzadri et al 2022 4 4 environmental implications at a regional and global scale expressed as per unit river and basin area in min river basin the first to eighth order rivers released a total of 4 38 kg n2o km 2 yr 1 and 0 05 kg n2o km 2 yr 1 respectively to the atmosphere which are 1 2 order of magnitude lower than those from east qinghai tibet plateau eqtp mean 126 kg n2o km 2 yr 1 0 50 kg n2o km 2 yr 1 zhang et al 2022 and river systems worldwide mean 1016 kg n2o kmv2 yr 1 3 84 kg n2o km 2 yr 1 table 4 this compassion indicates that per unit river n2o flux was significantly higher in urban than in pristine rivers because the intensive human activities can facilitate n2o emissions based on total river water area of 676 km2 calculated by arcgis 10 2 version and average n2o flux of 0 50 µg n2o m 2h 1 it is estimated that approximately 3 0 106 g n2o yr 1 from the min river basin was released to atmosphere while was lower than those in most rivers worldwide table 4 low order rivers small streams are generally low n concentrations and shallow water where the n2o production is largely constrained and the produced n2o is immediately released into atmosphere thereby leading to low n2o inventory in the waters the hyporheic exchange in the small streams can also contribute to n2o emissions however we could not address this part marzadri et al 2017 marzadri et al 2022 if the first and second order rivers are excluded negative flux other order rivers had a mean n2o flux of 7 97 kg n2o km 2 yr 1 which is approximately 2 times higher than the acquired areal flux of all stream orders meaning that low order rivers have great potential of n2o sinks in min river basin the water surface area of min river basin approximately consisted for 0 875 of global rivers and streams 773000 km2 allen pavelsky 2018 while disproportionately contributed to 0 014 of global river n2o emissions 378 gg n2o yr 1 yao et al 2020 suggesting that min river networks have low n2o emissions potential the radiative forcing of co2 emissions 22 9 gg co2 yr 1 unpublished data was 29 22 9 0 003 265 a 265 fold higher global warming potential as high as that of n2o emissions which was much lower than that in inland waters of africa 273 borges et al 2015 and higher than that in urban rivers of beijing 2 wang et al 2021 in addition n2o emission in co2 equiv was responsible for 2 4 of total greenhouse gas emissions in min river basin unpublished data ch4 9 8 gg yr 1 in co2 equiv 0 80 0 80 22 9 9 8 100 2 4 this percentage was higher than that of eqtp rivers 0 4 1 0 zhang et al 2022 and the pristine rivers 0 2 1 2 soued et al 2016 borges et al 2019 while lower than that of urban rivers of beijing 14 wang et al 2021 these comparisons suggest that strong human impacted rivers can increase the contribution of n2o to radiative forcing of total greenhouse gas which should be controlled in the climate warming it should be noted that the estimates of these gases emissions from water air interface are probably uncertain the gas transfer velocity k is critical for quantifying gas emissions using thin boundary layer method raymond et al 2012 water flow and turbulence can consistently alter the gas solubility in rivers in particular in the headstreams where river slope and velocity vary strongly and therefore affect k value greatly raymond et al 2012 the estimates of n2o emissions from our studied rivers may be highly uncertain as we did not measure river slope and topography conservatively this study at least can provide n2o dynamics in relation to stream morphology water variables land use as well as their cross correlations the low order streams presented n2o sinks thus the global estimates may not effectively concern this negative part of n2o emissions nor are crucial factors of n2o emissions well known for such rivers this study is a step forward in determining riverine n2o emissions at a basin scale and highlights the patterns and magnitudes of n2o concentration and flux across land uses our finding that water no3 was the best determinant of n2o concentrations and fluxes may also have widespread implications for n2o emissions in other human impacted rivers worldwide therefore upscaling the n2o emissions at the basin scale may be constrained through the limited number of sampling rivers mostly due to the high variability of n2o emissions across riverine ecosystems 5 conclusion n2o concentrations and fluxes were significantly higher in urban and cropland rivers than in forest rivers indicating that the main effect of land use is on the inorganic n load n2o concentrations and fluxes increased from first to eighth order rivers mostly due to the important influence of stream morphology on n2o emissions in addition land use indirectly affected n2o flux by mediating nutrient availability and water variables which may be the underlying mechanisms of land use dependence of n2o emissions in the river networks indirect n2o emission factors in most rivers were lower than the ipcc default value suggesting low n2o emissions potential in the min river basin the in river denitrification and nitrification contributed mainly to n2o emissions in cropland and urban rivers whereas the high doc no3 ratios 6 for small streams could facilitate the complete denitrification to be responsible for the n2o sink in the forest rivers therefore riverine n2o emissions can be increased by high inorganic n load yet the changes are also affected by the hydrogeological characteristics our findings also demonstrate the land use dependence of n2o flux on water variables and underline stream morphology when interpreting environmental controls on n2o flux and upscaling n2o emissions from the reach to
