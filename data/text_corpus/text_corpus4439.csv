22195,in the current paper we have developed a method based on 2d t theory to model the performance of doubled stepped planing hulls in asymmetric conditions we have performed computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations to evaluate the difference between the results of the 2d t method and cfd we have validated 2d t and cfd simulations the quantitative comparison between the results of both methods shows they predict almost similar heeling moment resistance and trim angle for a doubled stepped planing hull results of non stepped and doubled stepped planing hulls are compared against each other demonstrating that an increase in heel angle has less influence on the performance of the doubled stepped planing hull the heeling moment of a double stepped planing hull is found to be smaller than a heeling moment of a non stepped planing hull at early planing speeds but by the increase in speed heeling moment of doubled stepped planing hulls becomes slightly larger keywords doubled stepped planing hull asymmetric planing 2d t method cfd simulation running attitudes 1 introduction planing hulls with a transverse notch from one chine to another are known as stepped boats which can reach high speeds in the sea garland 2010 morabito and pavkov 2014 these vessels are used for a wide range of purposes e g sports and pleasure the step on the bottom of these hulls causes an air cavity just behind it dashtimanesh et al 2019a resulting in a smaller wetted surface and resistance while the boat not always may become less stable i e the air ventilation underneath the bottom can trigger transverse instabilities modelling of the hydrodynamic behavior of stepped planing hulls in non zero heel conditions asymmetric planing improves our understanding about the transverse instability of these vessels while low information is available as discussed by morabito et al 2014 and provides us with a pattern by which we can avoid instabilities in the early stage design see the published paper by xu et a 1999 to model the non zero heel condition for a planing boat it is required to compute the hydrodynamic pressure or forces acting on the boat and then to find the equilibrium condition of the vessle in calm water ghadimi et al 2017a empirical methods which are developed using a large variety of towing tank tests see savitsky 1964 are recognized as the first option that can be used for modeling of the asymmetric planing motion judge 2014 these methods have shown good ability in modeling of non stepped planing hulls in calm water conditions the method developed by savitsky 1964 which predicts the calm water performance of a hard chine planing hull is a good example of empirical methods used for simulations of planing motion the high potential of empirically developed methods in modeling of the heeled motion of a non stepped planing hull has been previously observed lewandowski 1997 ghadimi et al 2017 judge 2014 but for the case of stepped planing hulls there are still some challenges to establish any model for hydrodynamic simulation of a stepped planing boat the wake behind the step is needed to be found savitsky and morabito 2010 it has been seen that empirical models can be further developed for performance prediction of stepped planing hulls a zero heel angle condition in calm water dashtimanesh et al 2016 2017 when empirical equations of the free surface or linear wake theory are used to model water rise behind each step savitsky and morabito 2010 dashtimanesh et al 2016 2017 but the flow pattern becomes asymmetric when a planing boat rests at a non zero heel angle which can result in a different pattern of the hydrodynamic pressure iafrati and broglia 2008 under the action of such a condition empirical equations like those of savitsky 1964 are not applicable for the lifting surface locating behind of the step the 2d t method or so called 2 5d method which has been used to model the dynamic motions zarnick 1978 1979 martin 1976 payne 1995a and the performance of planing vessels ghadimi et al 2017a is another method that can be applied to model the problem asymmetric motion of a planing hull this method is developed using a two dimensional water entry problem which is then extended to a three dimensional 3d solution zarnick 1979 developed an early nonlinear mathematical method for the dynamic motion of a planing boat in waves by using 2d t theory at a very early stage simulations of this method were based on the added mass theory von karman 1929 concerns about the accuracy of this method in prediction of the sectional force managed some researchers to present more accurate solutions for sectional forces see e g in akers 1999 troesch and hicks 1994 hicks et al 1995 garme 2005 payne 1994 payne 1995b van deyzen 2008 ghadimi et al 2013b later the pressure based simulations like the methods presented by wagner 1932 and algarin and tascon 2011 were used to compute the sectional hydrodynamic forces e g zhao et al 1997 sun and faltinsen 2007 ghadimi et al 2016a 2d t method can also use available simulations of water entry with asymmetric flow pattern toyoma 1993 xu 1998 xu et al 1999 xu and troesch 1999 a and b korobkin and melenica 2005 algarin and tascon 2011 niazmand bilandi et al 2018 and obliquespeed judge et al 2004 gu et al 2014 izadi et al 2018 these solutions has been found to have the potential to be used for simulation of other motions of a planing hull like yawed heeled steady performance ghadimi et al 2013a ghadimi et al 2016b 2016c tavakoli and dashtimanesh 2019 tavakoli et al 2017a 2017b 2017c 2017d 2018a tavakoli and dashtimanesh 2018 dashtimanesh et al 2019b and maneuvering tavakoli et al 2018b 2018c tavakoli and dashtimanesh 2019 motions most recently 2d t method has been used to study the performance of double stepped planing hulls in calm water niazmand bilandi et al 2019a niazmand bilandi et al 2019a have found that this method works with proper accuracy for stepped planing hulls advancing in symmetric conditions if this very last effort is adopted for the asymmetric conditions like the work of ghadimi et al 2017a which is particular to the asymmetric motion of non stepped hulls it can provide simulation for the asymmetric motion of a doubled stepped planing boat last but not least numerical simulations of the viscous flow around a planing hull has been used to model the planing motion by some authors using computational fluid dynamics cfd approach see e g in dashtimanesh et al 2019b de marco et al 2017 di caterino et al 2018 esfandiari et al 2019 application of cfd in the field of naval hydrodynamics has seen to be accelerated in the last two decades 2017 khojasteh and kamali for the case of double stepped planing hulls fair accuracy in prediction of the wetted surface of the vessel and the dynamic trim angle has been reported by dashtimanesh et al 2019b while the 2d t theory can be used to simulate the problem cfd can also be used to solve the fluid field around a planing vessel iafrati and broglia 2010 whereas cfd models have high potential to model the problem planing motion they are time consuming and need high performance computers hpc in some cases where the number of grids becomes large and motions are involved stern et al 2015 therefore if it is not necessary and mathematical models provide us with accurate results we can neglect cfd simulations in the early stage design of the vessel for the case of a heeled doubled stepped planing boat we are not sure about this issue a comparison between cfd simulation and 2d t simulation can provide an answer for this question in the current paper 2d t and cfd methods are used to model the performance of heeled stepped planing hulls the 2d t method is developed by using the solution of the water entry of an asymmetric wedge and the linear wake profile assumption cfd is used to solve the governing equations on the viscous fluid flow around the heeled vessel the paper is organized as follows in the next section the problem is defined and the governing equations on the problem are presented in section 3 the 2d t method is developed the set up for the cfd model is described in section 4 validation of both 2d t and cfd method are presented in section 5 section 6 provides the main results of the paper first it is investigated how different the results of the cfd and 2d t models are then the influences of the step on the performance of a heeled planing hull are evaluated a summary of the results is presented in section 7 2 problem definition 2 1 hydrodynamic aspect in the current research it is assumed that a hard chine prismatic planing hull is moving forward with the velocity of v in the calm water condition at a fixed heel angle of ϕ as shown in the upper panel of fig 1 the vessel has two steps the front or first step located at l s 1 longitudinal position of the first step with respect to the transom and the rear or second step located at l s 2 longitudinal position of the second step with respect to the transom with heights of h 1 step height with respect to the bottom of the front body and h 2 step height with respect to the bottom of the middle body boat has a constant beam of b and a constant deadrise angle of β in its entire length when the boat locates at a heel angle of ϕ deadrise angles of port shown by subscript p and starboard shown by subscript s are found as 1 β p β ϕ β s β ϕ the boat reaches an equilibrium in the calm water i e it eventually locates at a constant dynamic trim angle shown by θ and its cg locates at a fixed vertical position with respect to the calm water in such a condition hydrodynamic and hydrostatic forces caused by the fluid pressure support the weight of the vessel which is denoted with δ the resistance force including fictional hydrodynamic and spray components acts on the vessel a heeling moment m h i keeps the vessel at the fixed heel angle of ϕ in response to this moment a restoring force due to pressure is produced the vessel dynamic obeys the newton s second law by assuming two coordinate systems a body fixed frame shown by gξηζ and a hydrodynamic frame which is located on the calm water and advances forward but doesn t have any heave and pitch motions denoted with oxyz the governing equations on the motion are found as 2 0 i 1 3 r x i f x i t 0 i 1 3 r z i f z i δ 0 i 1 3 m h i f ϕ i 0 i 1 3 r θ i f θ i in the above equation subscripts x z ϕ θ denote the forces or moments components in the surge heave roll and pitch directions respectively tis the thrust force and is assumed to pass through cg and be parallel to the calm water line i e this force doesn t affect the performance of the vessel note that effects of thrust force on performance of the vessel have been reported to be negligible savitsky 1964 ghadimi et al 2015 2016b finally we are computing performance of some planing models tested in the towing tank in the current research details are given in the sub section 2 2 all these tests are performed without any thrust force it is reasonable to neglect thrust force contribution when we want to replicate these experiments but the effects of thrust force can be applied in the future to make the method more general it is assumed that the double stepped planing hull is divided into three lifting surfaces including the fore or front surface the middle surface and the aft or rear surface each of these surfaces behaves not absolutely but almost like a planing hull see dashtimanesh et al 2018 the wetted keel lengths of the surfaces are denoted with l kf l km and l ka note that k refers to keel and are given by 3 l k f l k l s 1 4 l k m l s 1 l s 2 l d r y 1 5 l k a l s 2 l d r y 2 where l k is the overall wetted length l d r y is the ventilation length behind each step computation of which is explained in the next section forces acting on these surfaces and the entire vessel are needed to be found to compute the final equilibrium condition of the vessel the method for computing forces and moments is different from traditional techniques used for ships 2 2 investigated vessels in this study three different planing hulls models have been studied they are modeled by cfd and 2d t methods the first and second planing hulls are non stepped model c doubled stepped model c2 planing models previously introduced in the university of southampton taunton et al 2010 the performance of the double stepped planing hull is computed sub section 5 1 by both methods to check the validity of simulations also the heeling motion of the model c and the model c2 is computed to explore the effects of two steps on the performance and heeling moment of a planing vessel sub section 6 2 the principal characteristics of these two models are shown in table 1 note that l cg and v cg respectively refer to longitudinal and vertical positions of the cg their body plan is shown in panels a and b of fig 2 the third planing hull table 2 introduced in the united states naval academy is a non stepped planing hull previously studied by judge and judge 2013 the asymmetric motion of this planing hull is modeled by using both 2d t method and cfd to assess the validity of them in the prediction of the heeling moment the principal characteristics of this model is reported in table 2 its body plan is shown in panel c of fig 2 3 2d t method the current mathematical approach incorporates the linear wake assumption the wave profile behind the step and the 2d t theory to solve the problem the mathematical approach is developed by assuming flow is ideal a final iterative procedure is developed to predict the targeted parameters including running attitudes resistance force and heeling moment 3 1 linear wake assumption for the case of a stepped planing hull a linear wake assumption is used fig 3 a it is assumed that the wake behind each step is parallel to the calm water line niazmand bilandi et al 2019a b using this assumption the ventilated length behind each step is found as 6 l d r y i h i tan θ τ i 1 i 1 2 where h i is the step height θ is the dynamic trim angle and τ i is the local trim angle it is assumed that the longitudinal sections have different wake profiles which result in a local deadrise angle denoted with β i the deadrise angle behind each step in the non zero heel angle is found by 7 β p i β i β l i ϕ β s i β i β l i ϕ i 1 2 3 where β p is deadrise angle of port β s is deadrise angle of starboard β l is local deadrise angle and ϕ is heel angle 3 2 asymmetric planing and 2d t theory 3 2 1 conversion from 3d problem to 2d problem in time domain the heeled doubled stepped planing boat is assumed to pass through a fixed transverse plane tavakoli et al 2018d as shown in fig 3b the three dimensional 3d hydrodynamic problem is changed into three water entry problems for heeled asymmetric wedge sections find the technical commented on the 2d t method in the published papers by sun and faltinsen 2010 2011 for each planing surface a water entry problem with a vertical speed of 8 w i v sin θ τ i i 1 2 3 is established the 2d water entry problem is solved from time 0 which corresponds to the intersection of the keel and calm water in the considered planing surface to t p which corresponds to the transom step section given by 9 t p i l k i v i f m a longitudinal position with respect to the intersection of the calm water and keel corresponding to each time is found by 10 ξ s i v t cos θ τ i i 1 2 3 3 2 2 2d forces the pressure

i is the lateral distance from wedge apex c and μ are the half wetted beam and asymmetric parameter varying in time a dot over these parameters refers to the time rate of them ghadimi et al 2019a these two parameters are calculated as 12 μ i 0 5 c p i c s i i 1 2 3 13 c i 0 5 c p i c s i i 1 2 3 where c p i and c s i are the half wetted beam of the port and starboard respectively during the water entry of an asymmetric wedge three different phases depending on the chine wetting condition occur see fig 3b phase 1 two dry chines none of the chines has been touched by the water in this phase c μ and their time rates are given by 14 c i π 4 w i t i 1 tan β p i β l i 1 tan β s i β l i i 1 2 3 15 c i π 4 w i 1 tan β p i β l i 1 tan β s i β l i i 1 2 3 16 μ i π 4 w i t i 1 tan β p i β l

μ i b j i 2 μ i b j i 2 w i t i t c w j i j p s i 1 2 3 are needed to be solved where b j is the half beam of the boat at side j t cwi is time at which the water reaches chine and is found by 20 t c w j i 2 π b j i tan β j i β l i w i j p s i 1 2 3 also t i refers to the time details of the equations can be found in algarin and tascon 2011 integrating the hydrodynamic pressure over the wedge wall fig 3c the 2d hydrodynamic forces are found as 21 f h d i v s p p i cos β p i β l i d l s s p i cos β s i β l i d l i 1 2 3 22 f h d i h s p p i sin β p i β l i d l s s p i sin β s i β l i d l i 1 2 3 where superscripts v and h refer to the vertical and horizontal forces and l is the distance of any point from wedge apex dl is the differential of l the center of hydrodynamic force cp hdi is found by 23 c p h d i s p s s p i l d l s p s s p i d l i 1 2 3 hydrostatic force acting each section is found using 24 f h s i ρ w g a p i a s i a j i j p s i 1 2 3 where a j j p s is the wetted area of each section given by 25 a j i c j i 2 t a n β j i β l i c j i b ji a j i b j i 2 t a n β j i β l i c j i b j i j p s i 1 2 3 also the center of hydrostatic pressure cp hsi has is given 26 c p h s i b

respectively 3 2 3 3d forces integrating the 2d forces along the entire length of the boat three dimensional forces are computed but to consider the effects of transom step a transom correction function introduced by garme 2005 is implemented this function is given by 29 c t r i tanh 2 5 0 34 b f n b ξ i j ξ i i 1 2 3 where ξ i j is the longitudinal position of the step transom in the body fixed frame note that it is assumed that each step reduces 2d forces in the way a transom does niazmand bilandi et al 2019a b by implementing the transom reduction function the hydrodynamic force acting on each planing surface in the longitudinal direction is found by 30 f x i l w i f h d i v c t r i ξ sin θ τ i d ξ i 1 2 3 the vertical force summation of hydrodynamic pressure and hydrostatic pressure is found as 31 f z i l w i f h d i v c t r i ξ cos θ τ i d ξ l w i f h s i c t r i ξ d ξ i 1 2 3 the rolling and pitching moments are computed as 32 f ϕ i l w i m i c t r i ξ d ξ i 1 2 3 33 f

force acting on the pressure area and frictional force acting on the whisker spray area see savitsky et al 2007 begovic and bertorello 2012 ghadimi et al 2014 2015 the frictional force acting on the pressure and spray areas can be calculated using the equation 34 r i 1 2 ρ s w i v 2 c f i pr e s s u r e a r e a 1 2 ρ s s i v 2 c f i s p r a y a r e a i 1 2 3 where c f i is the frictional drag coefficient of each planing surface and has been determined using ittc 78 s w i and s s i respectively refer to the pressure and spray areas and have been computed using equations 35 s w i s w p i s w s i i 1 2 3 36 s s i s s p i s s s i i 1 2 3 the wetted pressure and spray areas for each side of planing surfaces are found by equations 37 and 38 respectively 37 s w j i ξ k i ξ c j i c j i cos β j

p s i 1 2 3 where ξ t or s refers to the longitudinal location of transom and step in the body fixed frame the pitching moments caused by frictional forces are found by 39 r θ i r i v c g c p tan β p

determination of the running attitudes of a heeled stepped hull by 2d t method has been shown in fig 4 the following steps are needed to be taken step1 a trim angle is guessed step2 a keel wetted length is guessed step3 water entry problem for each planing surface is solved section 3 2 2 step4 resistance force is computed equation 40 step5 the error of the heave equation f z δ ε is checked the keel wetted length is re guessed step 2 until the left side of heave equation converges to zero i e the lift and weight agree step6 the error of pitch equation f θ r θ ε is checked the trim angle is re guessed step 1 until the left side of pitch equation converges to zero i e the pitching moment vanishes 4 cfd model 4 1 computational approach the numerical modelling is performed by assuming that fluid is newtonian viscous and two phases air and water continuity and navier stokes ns equations govern on the fluid field as 41 u 0 42 t ρ e f f u ρ e f f u u t p t ρ e f f f b where u u x x y z t u y x y z t u z x y z t t is fluid velocity ρ e f f x y z t is the effective density p x y z t is the pressure t x y z t is the viscous stress tensor f b 0 0 g is the force due to gravity the stress tensor should be calculated with the realizable k ε model the air water flow is solved by using the volume of fluid method hirt and nichols 1981 the governing equation on the volume fraction parameter is given by 43 t α α u 0 where volume fraction parameter α varies between 0 pure air and 1 pure water and is used to find effective parameters dashtimanesh et al 2018 once the equations are solved the forces and moments acting on the vessels are found as 44 f s p σ n d s 45 m s p σ n r d s where σ is the normal stress tensor and s is the total area of the boat n is the normal unit vector the longitudinal components of the force f x is set to be the total resistance the vertical component of the force is the lift the moment also includes heeling and pitching moments during the simulation heave and pitch directions are set to be free and the equilibrium condition is found all equations are solved by finite volume method using a commercial cfd code siemens plm star ccm details of the numerical approach can be found in siemens plm star ccm user s guide version 14 02 010 cd adapco 2019 4 2 computational domain to provide the set up for the numerical simulation a computational domain is defined as shown in fig 5 an inlet boundary and an outlet boundary are defined at both ends of the domain water and air enter from the inlet boundary condition located at the right end of the domain a no slip boundary condition is set on the bottom and upper surfaces two side boundaries are defined which behave like an inlet patch the walls of the vessel are defined to behave like a wall on which no slip condition is satisfied a summary of boundaries is shown in table 3 moreover the dimensions of the domain and the location of the boat are set using the recommendations of ittc see ittc 7 5 02 02 01 the boat transom is located at 3 lpp far from the inlet the depth of the computational domain is 3 5 lpp the outlet boundary should be located 3 lpp from the hull the domain is 4 lpp wide water light gray is initially set to be at the rest note that technical information about dimension of the domain can be found in zou et al 2019 4 3 gridding methodology and mesh convergence to discretize the numerical domain the morphing mesh approach is combined with rigid dynamic motion the numerical grid is generated by using different types of grids including 1 surface remesher 2 prism layer mesher and 3 trimmer dashtimanesh et al 2019b the smallest grids are defined near the free surface and the vessel which are of interest an overview of the mesh is shown in the upper panel of fig 6 the wall function approach is used to model treatments of the fluid near the walls of the vessel in particular the all wall y model is used y is set to vary between 30 and 300 as shown in the middle panel of the fig 6 four different mesh including coarse corresponds to 432151 grids medium 625451 grids fine 802221 grids and finest 1011102 grids are considered mesh study is performed and it is found that the results converge for the medium mesh size a sample of the mesh study for resistance prediction of a double stepped planing hull at beam froude number of 4 36 is illustrated in the lower panel of fig 6 5 comparison analysis there is no available experimental laboratory data presenting the performance of double stepped planing hulls moving forward at the non zero heel angle to assess the accuracy of both 2d t and cfd models in the prediction of the performance of a heeled double steeped vessel two different validation studies are performed the first validation study focuses on the performance of a doubled stepped planing hull moving forward in symmetric condition running attitudes and resistance of the vessel are found and compared against experimental data the second validation study focuses on the modeling of a heeled non stepped ponding hull advancing in calm water the heeling moment and normal force acting on the vessel are computed and compared against experimental data the errors in prediction of any parameter like running attitudes or forces is computed using 46 e 2 d t or cfd a e x p a 2 d t or cfd a e x p 100 where exp stands for experimental measurements 5 1 double stepped planing hull with zero heel angle running attitudes and resistance of a doubled stepped planing hull model c2 are found using the 2d t method and cfd model results including the dynamic trim angle resistance and the wetted surface are presented in fig 7 the experimental data are also shown in the figure the comparison of the predicted dynamic trim angle against experimental measurements fig 7a shows that both cfd and 2d t models have reasonable accuracy in prediction of trim trim angles computed by the cfd model and 2d t method are seen to follow the experimental data but cfd circles is more accurate than 2d t method triangles the cfd model and the 2d t method predict the resistance of the double stepped planing boat with proper accuracy fig 7b at high speeds the 2d t model provides better accuracy the graphs corresponding to the predicted and measured wetted surface diverge from the experimental method note that the experimental results squares fluctuate to sum the cfd model used in the current research predicts the trim angle and resistance with average errors of 10 9 and 6 22 respectively table 4 one of the main reasons for the errors of the current cfd model is the technique morphing mesh used to model the dynamic motion of the boat the previous cfd researches have shown that other motion techniques like overset technique can decrease the errors in the prediction of the trim angle under 8 percent in most of the cases when the equilibrium condition of a planing hull is numerically simulated details can be found in de luca et al 2016 de marco et al 2017 and sukas et al 2017 besides the errors in prediction of the resistance can also be attributed to the dynamic technique used in the current research the over predictions in the trim angle which are resulted from the morphing mesh technique lead in over prediction of the resistance induced drag caused by hydrodynamic pressure in sum the morphing mesh technique has caused an extra error in the prediction of the trim angel and resistance which has also been reported by dashtimanesh et al 2018 which is needed to be further investigated in the future note that performing simulations with fixed trim angle and pitch can highly increase the accuracy of cfd model in computation of the resistance see e g in ferrando et al 2015 and ghadimi et al 2019b but such an assumption cannot help us to evaluate the effects of asymmetric condition on running attitudes of the vessel which is the main aim of the current paper the 2d t method predicts the trim angle with an average error of 20 8 note that this average error corresponds to the beam froude numbers ranging from 1 9 to 5 6 the smallest considered speed 4 05 m s corresponds to the beam froude number of 1 80 which is categorized as a semi planing speed not planing the 2d t method is not expected to work for this speed but we have performed simulations at all speeds to see how the method works for all experiments the largest error is seen to occur at the mentioned speed 2 07 m s if we only consider the range of applicability of the 2d t method fr 2 0 the average error drops to 18 3 one of the main reasons for the error is the method used to apply the effects of step on the sectional forces eq 29 this function is originally developed to apply the effects of the transom on the sectional force of a stepless boat but for the case of a stepped boat while the kutta condition zero pressure governs on the step step effects on the sectional force in its vicinity is less significant compared with a transom of a step boat because the wetted length of the lifting surface locating in front of the step is much smaller than the wetted length of the stepless boat when we use this function eq 29 the center of pressure might be predicted to be closer to the transom than what it is which may lead to under prediction of the trim angle to some degrees as a result the induced drag may also be under predicted besides for the case of a stepped boat side wetted area near the chine of the middle lifting surface may appear due to vortices this area is found not to result in any remarkable hydrodynamic pressure while it can marginally contribute to the resistance subsequently the resistance may be under predicted to some degrees it is necessary to provide new methods to predict the transom step reduction function with better accuracy in the future moreover to increase the accuracy of the current method especially in the prediction of the resistance some simplified methods for prediction of the wetted area located near the chine are needed to be proposed 5 2 heeled non stepped planing hull the asymmetric motion of a heeled planing hull experiments of judge and judge 2013 is replicated by using 2d t and cfd models the vertical force and the heeling moment are computed and compared against experimental data the performance of the vessel at different drafts η 3 0 5 0 75 1 1 25 and 1 5 computed by 51 η 3 t c u r r e n t t nomina l is found simulations are performed for frb 3 6 corresponding to the speed of 7 54 m s fig 8 displays the predicted and measured values of the lift force vs heel angle at different drafts the lift force increases by the increase in the heel angle at three smaller drafts at the two large drafts the vertical force decreases by the increase in the heel angle the panels of fig 8 illustrate that the results of both cfd and 2d t data fit with experimental data especially at three smaller drafts at the two larger drafts errors appear which can be not defiantly attributed to the larger wetted surface of the vessel i e larger pressure area can be a source of the error in the predictions this point needs to be investigated in detail in the near future the errors in the prediction of the lift force of the heeled non stepped planing boat are presented in table 5 showing that for most of the cases the vertical force is predicted by both 2d t method and cfd with an error under 10 percent the heeling moment of a heeled planing hull at frb 3 6 is computed by both 2d t and cfd methods comparisons of the predictions against experimental measurements are shown in fig 9 as evident the 2d t and cfd method predict the heeling moment with almost good accuracy in all cases some errors appeared at large heel angel of 20 which equal to the deadrise angle of the vessel in this condition the starboard of the vessel is touched by the vessel at all the wetted sections of the vessel both 2d t and cfd methods lead to errors in this condition increasing the accuracy of simulations at large heel angles should be considered in future studies in the next section where the main results are presented this heel angle is not modeled by both methods the errors corresponded to the 2d t and cfd methods in prediction of the heeling moment are shown in table 6 the good accuracy of both cfd and 2d t methods in prediction of running attitude of a doubled stepped planing boat and forces acting on a heeled non stepped planing hull show that both methods can be used to model performance of a heeled double stepped planing hull 6 results 6 1 comparison between 2d t method cfd a heeled doubled stepped planing hull is modeled by both 2d t and cfd methods results are compared against each other to see how different the results of these methods are three different beam froude numbers including 2 94 corresponding to the speed of 6 25 m s 3 83 corresponding to the speed of 8 13 and 4 32 corresponding to the speed of 9 18 m s along with three different heel angles of 5 10 and 15 are considered the symmetric conditions are also modeled note that the considered speeds correspond to the cases for which the errors of cfd and 2d t methods have seen to be smaller see table 4 the computed trim angles of the double stepped planing hull in symmetric and asymmetric planing conditions are shown in fig 10 results of both 2d t method circles and cfd triangles agree with each other in most of the cases results of 2d t method are seen to follow the experimental data at heel angles of 5 and 10 but at the heel angle of 15 trim angle of 2d t method and cfd model diverge from each other which shows that for the case of a doubled stepped planing hull at large heel angles 2d t method predicts larger normal forces this fact will be discussed in detail later the predicted values of the resistance of the model c2 in asymmetric conditions are found using the 2d t and cfd methods the results are displayed in fig 11 the values of the predicted resistance by the 2d t method are found to be larger than the predicted values of the resistance by cfd in zero heel condition as was seen earlier fig 7 at the non zero heel angles the results of 2d t and cfd methods are observed to be closer to each other and fit for most of the cases this point shows that in asymmetric condition 2d t method and cfd model provide similar results for the resistance of a double stepped planing hull while they might not fit at the zero heel angel condition it was earlier discussed that the emergence of the wetted area near the chine of the vessel which are not computed by the 2d t method can lead to this discrepancy between the computed resistance by the 2d t method and cfd model but when the vessel locates at a heel angle of ϕ this area is found to become smaller which will be shown later or even vanish in some cases subsequently the resistance computed by cfd and 2d t models match fig 12 displays the computed wetted surface of the doubled stepped planing hull model c2 by both 2d t and cfd methods results of this figure provide evidence that predicted wetted surface by cfd and 2d t methods agree with each other in most of the cases results of both methods diverge from each other at the largest beam froude number frb 4 32 and heel angle ϕ 15 it should be noted that the difference between predicted wetted surface by 2d t and cfd methods is larger at the largest heel angle imposing that when heel angle increases both methods show different behavior in the prediction of wetted surface it has been attempted to study the reason for this difference the related study is shown in the upcoming discussions in this sub section fig 13 shows the computed heeling moment of the double stepped planing hull at different heel angles the heeling moment of the doubled steeped planing hull is seen to decrease by the increase in froude number numerical predictions of cfd triangles agree with predictions of 2d t theory circles at most of the cases the largest differences between the results heeling moment of 2d t and cfd methods are observed at the largest heel angle where the 2d t method predict smaller heeling moment note that these differences are not significant and are about 24 percent in the most case panel c by the increase in the speed the predictions made by the cfd model and 2d t model fit overall by the increase in the speed the discrepancy between the heeling moment predicted by the cfd model and 2d t becomes smaller note that at the higher speeds the contribution of hydrodynamic pressure becomes dominant in such a situation the cfd model and 2d t method predict similar values for the heeling moment the top views of the wetted surface of the doubled stepped planing hull obtained by 2d t and cfd methods are shown in fig 14 note that the wetted surface of the zero heel condition is not shown in this figure the results show that the wetted surface of the middle planing surface is negligible this surface is almost dry in all cases and a small proportion of the area of this surface is wetted by water this implies that this surface doesn t contribute to generation of forces significantly the cfd model predicts extra wetted surfaces near the chine of the second and third surfaces which are not captured by the 2d t model as explained earlier these wetted areas are seen to emerge when the chine of the fore planing surface is not fully wetted see some similar discussion in the thesis of lee et al 2014 de marco et al 2017 have the attributed appearance of these wetted areas to the vortices path these wetted surfaces are seen not to have any significant contribution in the hydrodynamic lift but frictional forces caused by the shear stresses can occur there 2d t model cannot predict such forces and thus it can compute smaller resistance in the cases these wetted surfaces are large as seen by the increase in speed and heel angle these wetted surface the wetted surface around the chine become smaller this fact is consistent with what was observed in fig 11 i e the difference between the predicted resistance by the cfd model and 2d t model becomes smaller by the increase in the heel angel moreover at larger heel angles e g heel angle of 15 the predicted wetted surface of the fore planing hull by the 2d t method is larger which is consistent with the presented results in fig 12 where the 2d t computes larger wetted surface overall the 2d t method was found to have an average error of 18 4 in the prediction of the trim angle of the planing hull in zero heel the predicted trim angle by the 2d t method in the zero heel condition was highly different from the cfd model i e the 2d t model under predicts the trim angle while cfd model over predicts the trim angle at symmetric planing condition but it was seen that the results of both methods agree in the asymmetric conditions at most of cases the only significant differences of the predicted trim angle were observed at the heel angle of 15 fig 10d which were attributed to predicted wetted surface by the 2d t model fig 12d while it was seen that cfd and 2d t models predict different values for resistance in the symmetric condition both methods were found to compute similar resistance see fig 11 in asymmetric condition the analysis of the wetted surface pattern on the bottom of the stepped planing hulls showed that when wetted surfaces near the chine of the middle and rear bodies are notable predicted resistance by the cfd and 2d t models diverge such a condition is more probable in the symmetric condition but by the increase in the speed and heel angle these wetted surfaces near the chine are smaller and thus the predicted resistance by the cfd and 2d t models fit overall the predicted trim angle resistance wetted surface and heeling moment predicted by cfd and 2d t agree with each other at most of the cases the only difference is observed at large heel angle ϕ 15 where wetted surface and trim angle predicted by cfd and 2d t diverge from each other 6 2 effect of adding two steps on performance of heeled planing hull effects of steps on the performance of a heeled planing hull are studied by simulating the asymmetric motion of model c non stepped planing hull and c2 doubled stepped planing hull and then comparing results including dynamic trim angle resistance wetted surface and heeling moment against each other simulations are performed for the beam froude number ranging from 1 9 corresponding to the speed of 4 05 m s to 5 24 corresponding to the speed of 11 3 m s and three heel angles of 5 10 and 15 since 2d t and cfd methods provide almost similar results for the asymmetric planing see discussed in sub section 6 2 only the 2d t method is used to simulate the problem note that the 2d t method has been observed to work properly for the non stepped planing hull previously ghadimi et al 2017a the dynamic trim angle of the heeled non stepped filled circles and the double stepped planing hulls unfilled circles are shown in fig 15 the trim angle is seen to decrease by the increase in heel angle for both hulls note that ghadimi et al 2017 have similarly observed that the trim angle of a heeled planing hull is affected and reduces by the increase in heel angle the trim angle of the heeled double stepped planing hull is less affected by the increase in heel angle especially at smaller beam froude numbers e g at the beam froude number of 2 0 5 degrees change in the heel angle of non stepped planing hull causes a 1 0 degree reduction in trim angle compare filled circles of fig 15a b and c while for the case of a double stepped planing hull this reduction is seen to be under 0 2 the hydrodynamic force acting on the boat causes this behavior for the case of a doubled stepped planing boat the dominant force supporting the weight of the vessel is the hydrodynamic force at small beam froude numbers and hydrostatic force doesn t contribute remarkably whereas for the case of a non stepped planing hull see the pressure distribution discussion in dashtimanesh et al 2018 hydrostatic force has larger contribution an asymmetric condition i e non zero heel angle increases the hydrodynamic pressure significantly for the case of a non stepped planing hull further discussion is presented in the rest of this sub section fig 16 shows the values of computed resistance for the non stepped filled circles and the stepped unfilled planing hulls in the asymmetric condition the values of the resistance of both vessels are seen to increase by an increase in the speed as expected for any planing vessel fridsma 1969 the presence of non zero heel angles affect both vessels in different ways for the case of the non stepped planing hull non zero heel angles reduce the resistance at two smaller beam froude numbers frb 2 0 and 3 19 e g at beam froude number of 2 0 the resistance of the non stepped planing hulls decreases from 2 0 to 3 19 as the heel angle increases from 5 to 10 at larger beam froude numbers frb 3 83 the resistance of the non stepped planing hull increases by the increase in heel angle but for the case of a double stepped planing hull an increase in the heel angle causes slight reductions up to 10 percent in resistance at all beam froude numbers these results provide the evidence that the presence of two steps can manage a vessel to reach high speeds even in heeled planing motion because the resistance is not affected and is still far smaller than non stepped vessel a study of the wetted surface of both vessels at non zero heel angles which will be presented later improve our understanding of the resistance results the wetted surface of the doubled stepped and the non stepped planing hulls are presented in fig 17 the values of the wetted surface of both hulls reduce by the increase in beam froude number in the non zero heel condition an increase in heel angel reduces the wetted surface of the non stepped planing hull at two smaller beam froude numbers frb 1 9 and 2 94 at the larger beam froude numbers heel angle increases the wetted surface of the vessel this shows that when the speed is increased and the vessel rests at a non zero heel angle larger wetted surfaces are needed to support the weight of the vessel for the case of a doubled stepped planing hull however an increase in the value of the heel angle results in the reduction of the wetted surface which is not significant note that these results are consistent with the resistance results fig 16 comparisons between the heeling moment of both hulls at different heel angels and beam froude numbers are shown in fig 18 heeling moments of both vessels decrease by the increase in speed note that balsamo et al similarly observed that the heeling moment of a planing hull decreases by the increase in the speed of the vessel at heel angle of 5 the heeling moment of the non stepped planing hull filled circles is larger than heeling moment of double stepped planing hulls unfilled circles at the heel angle of the 10 the heeling moment of the non stepped planing hull is larger than the heeling moment of the double stepped planing hulls at beam froude numbers ranging from 1 9 to 3 83 at larger beam froude numbers the heeling moment of the double stepped planing hull becomes larger at heel angle of 15 the heeling moment of the double stepped planing hull is larger than the heeling moment of a non stepped planing hull at all speeds overall the results reveal that by the increase in speed and heel angle the heeling moment of the double stepped planing hull becomes larger than that of a non stepped planing hull the reason underlying this behavior is the hydrodynamic pressure which causes the dominant force in supporting the weight of the vessel when speed is increased and heel angle grows a larger difference between forces in starboard and port of the vessel appears the double stepped planing hull has three maximum pressure area while the non stepped has one which take larger forces in larger heel angle and speeds more evidence regarding this fact is presented in the fig 19 to increase the understanding of effects of heel angle on the heeling moment of both hulls hydrodynamic heeling moment and hydrostatic heeling moment of both hull at two heel angles of 5 and 15 and beam froude numbers of 2 94 and 5 24 are computed and shown in fig 19 the hydrostatic moment left panel of fig 19 of the doubled stepped filled circles planing hull is smaller at the larger beam froude number circles with dashed lines hydrostatic heeling moment significantly decreases the difference between the hydrostatic heeling moment of the doubled stepped hull and the non stepped planing hull become very small at this beam froude number in comparison with what it was at smaller beam froude number solid lines with circles hydrodynamic heeling moments right panel of both vessels decrease by the increase in speed solid lines are located above the dashed lines the double stepped planing hull has larger heeling moments at all conditions the interesting point is that at larger heel angles and higher beam froude numbers the hydrodynamic heeling moment of the doubled stepped planing hull is significantly larger than the hydrodynamic heeling moment of the non stepped planing hull which results in higher heeling moment which is the summation of hydrostatic and hydrodynamic heeling moments for the doubled steeped planing hull this fact supports what was observed in fig 18 7 conclusion in the current paper hydrodynamic of heeled doubled stepped planing hulls were studied it was aimed to provide a numerical method based on 2d t theory for performance prediction of heeled double stepped planing hull and investigate whether results of this method and cfd fit or not a secondary aim of the current research was to improve the understating of the effects of adding two steps on the bottom of a planing hull on its performance in non zero heel conditions the 2d t method was developed by using the theoretical solutions of water entry of a solid wedge a cfd set up was developed using fvm and vof the validity of both methods was assessed by comparing their results against previous experimental data in two steps in the first step the performance of a doubled stepped planing hull was predicted 2d t and cfd were found to provide predictions for the dynamic trim angle resistance and wetted surface with reasonable accuracy in the second step heel motion of a non stepped planing hull was modeled and it was shown that 2d t and cfd methods accurately predict the forces acting on the vessel hydrodynamic of a heeled doubled stepped planing hull was modeled using both the 2d t method and cfd cfd and the 2d t methods provided similar heeling moment and resistance at all speed and heel angles there was an agreement between mathematically and numerically computed trim angle and wetted surface at heel angels of the 5 and 10 but at a heel angle of 15 the trim angle and wetted surface computed by cfd and 2d t method diverged not significantly from each other by the increase in the speed but these differences didn t affect the heeling moment and resistance also while the predicted resistance by the 2d t method and cfd model were seen to be different in symmetric conditions they fit in the asymmetric condition the wetted surfaces near the chine of the middle and rear lifting surfaces which were not computed by the 2d t method were seen to become very small in the asymmetric condition which decreases the difference between predicted resistance by the 2d t method and cfd model in asymmetric condition 2d t method was used to model both doubled stepped and non stepped planing hulls the following conclusions were made when a non stepped planing hull locates at a non zero heel angle its dynamic trim angle is decreased at smaller speeds while it is increased at larger speeds but when a double stepped planing hull locates at a non zero heel angle its trim angle is not significantly reduced at high speeds an increase in the heel angle of a non stepped planing hull increases the resistance of the vessel since the wetted surface increases but for the case of a doubled stepped planing hull resistance and the wetted surface of the vessel are found to decrease at all speeds by the increase in heel angle the presence of three maximum pressure areas helps the double stepped to keep its speed at the higher range in non zero heel conditions heeling moment of a non stepped planing hull is larger than the heeling moment of the doubled stepped planing hull at early planing speeds but by the increase in the speed the hydrostatic heeling moment vanishes while hydrodynamic heeling moment becomes dominant in this condition the doubled stepped planing hull which is supported by larger hydrodynamic pressure

22195,in the current paper we have developed a method based on 2d t theory to model the performance of doubled stepped planing hulls in asymmetric conditions we have performed computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations to evaluate the difference between the results of the 2d t method and cfd we have validated 2d t and cfd simulations the quantitative comparison between the results of both methods shows they predict almost similar heeling moment resistance and trim angle for a doubled stepped planing hull results of non stepped and doubled stepped planing hulls are compared against each other demonstrating that an increase in heel angle has less influence on the performance of the doubled stepped planing hull the heeling moment of a double stepped planing hull is found to be smaller than a heeling moment of a non stepped planing hull at early planing speeds but by the increase in speed heeling moment of doubled stepped planing hulls becomes slightly larger keywords doubled stepped planing hull asymmetric planing 2d t method cfd simulation running attitudes 1 introduction planing hulls with a transverse notch from one chine to another are known as stepped boats which can reach high speeds in the sea garland 2010 morabito and pavkov 2014 these vessels are used for a wide range of purposes e g sports and pleasure the step on the bottom of these hulls causes an air cavity just behind it dashtimanesh et al 2019a resulting in a smaller wetted surface and resistance while the boat not always may become less stable i e the air ventilation underneath the bottom can trigger transverse instabilities modelling of the hydrodynamic behavior of stepped planing hulls in non zero heel conditions asymmetric planing improves our understanding about the transverse instability of these vessels while low information is available as discussed by morabito et al 2014 and provides us with a pattern by which we can avoid instabilities in the early stage design see the published paper by xu et a 1999 to model the non zero heel condition for a planing boat it is required to compute the hydrodynamic pressure or forces acting on the boat and then to find the equilibrium condition of the vessle in calm water ghadimi et al 2017a empirical methods which are developed using a large variety of towing tank tests see savitsky 1964 are recognized as the first option that can be used for modeling of the asymmetric planing motion judge 2014 these methods have shown good ability in modeling of non stepped planing hulls in calm water conditions the method developed by savitsky 1964 which predicts the calm water performance of a hard chine planing hull is a good example of empirical methods used for simulations of planing motion the high potential of empirically developed methods in modeling of the heeled motion of a non stepped planing hull has been previously observed lewandowski 1997 ghadimi et al 2017 judge 2014 but for the case of stepped planing hulls there are still some challenges to establish any model for hydrodynamic simulation of a stepped planing boat the wake behind the step is needed to be found savitsky and morabito 2010 it has been seen that empirical models can be further developed for performance prediction of stepped planing hulls a zero heel angle condition in calm water dashtimanesh et al 2016 2017 when empirical equations of the free surface or linear wake theory are used to model water rise behind each step savitsky and morabito 2010 dashtimanesh et al 2016 2017 but the flow pattern becomes asymmetric when a planing boat rests at a non zero heel angle which can result in a different pattern of the hydrodynamic pressure iafrati and broglia 2008 under the action of such a condition empirical equations like those of savitsky 1964 are not applicable for the lifting surface locating behind of the step the 2d t method or so called 2 5d method which has been used to model the dynamic motions zarnick 1978 1979 martin 1976 payne 1995a and the performance of planing vessels ghadimi et al 2017a is another method that can be applied to model the problem asymmetric motion of a planing hull this method is developed using a two dimensional water entry problem which is then extended to a three dimensional 3d solution zarnick 1979 developed an early nonlinear mathematical method for the dynamic motion of a planing boat in waves by using 2d t theory at a very early stage simulations of this method were based on the added mass theory von karman 1929 concerns about the accuracy of this method in prediction of the sectional force managed some researchers to present more accurate solutions for sectional forces see e g in akers 1999 troesch and hicks 1994 hicks et al 1995 garme 2005 payne 1994 payne 1995b van deyzen 2008 ghadimi et al 2013b later the pressure based simulations like the methods presented by wagner 1932 and algarin and tascon 2011 were used to compute the sectional hydrodynamic forces e g zhao et al 1997 sun and faltinsen 2007 ghadimi et al 2016a 2d t method can also use available simulations of water entry with asymmetric flow pattern toyoma 1993 xu 1998 xu et

been found to have the potential to be used for simulation of other motions of a planing hull like yawed heeled steady performance ghadimi et al 2013a ghadimi et al 2016b 2016c tavakoli and dashtimanesh 2019 tavakoli et al 2017a 2017b 2017c 2017d 2018a tavakoli and dashtimanesh 2018 dashtimanesh et al 2019b and maneuvering tavakoli et al 2018b 2018c tavakoli and dashtimanesh 2019 motions most recently 2d t method has been used to study the performance of double stepped planing hulls in calm water niazmand bilandi et al 2019a niazmand bilandi et al 2019a have found that this method works with proper accuracy for stepped planing hulls advancing in symmetric conditions if this very last effort is adopted for the asymmetric conditions like the work of ghadimi et al 2017a which is particular to the asymmetric motion of non stepped hulls it can provide simulation for the asymmetric motion of a doubled stepped planing boat last but not least numerical simulations of the viscous flow around a planing hull has been used to model the planing motion by some authors using computational fluid dynamics cfd approach see e g in dashtimanesh et al 2019b de marco et al 2017 di caterino et al 2018 esfandiari et al 2019 application of cfd in the field of naval hydrodynamics has seen to be accelerated in the last two decades 2017 khojasteh and kamali for the case of double stepped planing hulls fair accuracy in prediction of the wetted surface of the vessel and the dynamic trim angle has been reported by dashtimanesh et al 2019b while the 2d t theory can be used to simulate the problem cfd can also be used to solve the fluid field around a planing vessel iafrati and broglia 2010 whereas cfd models have high potential to model the problem planing motion they are time consuming and need high performance computers hpc in some cases where the number of grids becomes large and motions are involved stern et al 2015 therefore if it is not necessary and mathematical models provide us with accurate results we can neglect cfd simulations in the early stage design of the vessel for the case of a heeled doubled stepped planing boat we are not sure about this issue a comparison between cfd simulation and 2d t simulation can provide an answer for this question in the current paper 2d t and cfd methods are used to model the performance of heeled stepped planing hulls the 2d t method is developed by using the solution of the water entry of an asymmetric wedge and the linear wake profile assumption cfd is used to solve the governing equations on the viscous fluid flow around the heeled vessel the paper is organized as follows in the next section the problem is defined and the governing equations on the problem are presented in section 3 the 2d t method is developed the set up for the cfd model is described in section 4 validation of both 2d t and cfd method are presented in section 5 section 6 provides the main results of the paper first it is investigated how different the results of the cfd and 2d t models are then the influences of the step on the performance of a heeled planing hull are evaluated a summary of the results is presented in section 7 2 problem definition 2 1 hydrodynamic aspect in the current research it is assumed that a hard chine prismatic planing hull is moving forward with the velocity of v in the calm water condition at a fixed heel angle of ϕ as shown in the upper panel of fig 1 the vessel has two steps the front or first step located at l s 1 longitudinal position of the first step with respect to the transom and the rear or second step located at l s 2 longitudinal position of the second step with respect to the transom with heights of h 1 step height with respect to the bottom of the front body and h 2 step height with respect to the bottom of the middle body boat has a constant beam of b and a constant deadrise angle of β in its entire length when the boat locates at a heel angle of ϕ deadrise angles of port shown by subscript p and starboard shown by subscript s are found as 1 β p β ϕ β s β ϕ the boat reaches an equilibrium in the calm water i e it eventually locates at a constant dynamic trim angle shown by θ and its cg locates at a fixed vertical position with respect to the calm water in such a condition hydrodynamic and hydrostatic forces caused by the fluid pressure support the weight of the vessel which is denoted with δ the resistance force including fictional hydrodynamic and spray components acts on the vessel a heeling moment m h i keeps the vessel at the fixed heel angle of ϕ in response to this moment a restoring force due to pressure is produced the vessel dynamic obeys the newton s second law by assuming two coordinate systems a body fixed frame shown by gξηζ and a hydrodynamic frame which is located on the calm water and advances forward but doesn t have any heave and pitch motions denoted with oxyz the governing equations on the motion are found as 2 0 i 1 3 r x i f x i t 0 i 1 3 r z i f z i δ 0 i 1 3 m h i f ϕ i 0 i 1 3 r θ i f θ i in the above equation subscripts x z ϕ θ denote the forces or moments components in the surge heave roll and pitch directions respectively tis the thrust force and is assumed to pass through cg and be parallel to the calm water line i e this force doesn t affect the performance of the vessel note that effects of thrust force on performance of the vessel have been reported to be negligible savitsky 1964 ghadimi et al 2015 2016b finally we are computing performance of some planing models tested in the towing tank in the current research details are given in the sub section 2 2 all these tests are performed without any thrust force it is reasonable to neglect thrust force contribution when we want to replicate these experiments but the effects of thrust force can be applied in the future to make the method more general it is assumed that the double stepped planing hull is divided into three lifting surfaces including the fore or front surface the middle surface and the aft or rear surface each of these surfaces behaves not absolutely but almost like a planing hull see dashtimanesh et al 2018 the wetted keel lengths of the surfaces are denoted with l kf l km and l ka note that k refers to keel and are given by 3 l k f l k l s 1 4 l k m l s 1 l s 2 l d r y 1 5 l k a l s 2 l d r y 2 where l k is the overall wetted length l d r y is the ventilation length behind each step computation of which is explained in the next section forces acting on these surfaces and the entire vessel are needed to be found to compute the final equilibrium condition of the vessel the method for computing forces and moments is different from traditional techniques used for ships 2 2 investigated vessels in this study three different planing hulls models have been studied they are modeled by cfd and 2d t methods the first and second planing hulls are non stepped model c doubled stepped model c2 planing models previously introduced in the university of southampton taunton et al 2010 the performance of the double stepped planing hull is computed sub section 5 1 by both methods to check the validity of simulations also the heeling motion of the model c and the model c2 is computed to explore the effects of two steps on the performance and heeling moment of a planing vessel sub section 6 2 the principal characteristics of these two models are shown in table 1 note that l cg and v cg respectively refer to longitudinal and vertical positions of the cg their body plan is shown in panels a and b of fig 2 the third planing hull table 2 introduced in the united states naval academy is a non stepped planing hull previously studied by judge and judge 2013 the asymmetric motion of this planing hull is modeled by using both 2d t method and cfd to assess the validity of them in the prediction of the heeling moment the principal characteristics of this model is reported in table 2 its body plan is shown in panel c of fig 2 3 2d t method the current mathematical approach incorporates the linear wake assumption the wave profile behind the step and the 2d t theory to solve the problem the mathematical approach is developed by assuming flow is ideal a final iterative procedure is developed to predict the targeted parameters including running attitudes resistance force and heeling moment 3 1 linear wake assumption for the case of a stepped planing hull a linear wake assumption is used fig 3 a it is assumed that the wake behind each step is parallel to the calm water line niazmand bilandi et al 2019a b using this assumption the ventilated length behind each step is found as 6 l d r y i h i tan θ τ i 1 i 1 2 where h i is the step height θ is the dynamic trim angle and τ i is the local trim angle it is assumed that the longitudinal sections have different wake profiles which result in a local deadrise angle denoted with β i the deadrise angle behind each step in the non zero heel angle is found by 7 β p i β i β l i ϕ β s i β i β l i ϕ i 1 2 3 where β p is deadrise angle of port β s is deadrise angle of starboard β l is local deadrise angle and ϕ is heel angle 3 2 asymmetric planing and 2d t theory 3 2 1 conversion from 3d problem to 2d problem in time domain the heeled doubled stepped planing boat is assumed to pass through a fixed transverse plane tavakoli et al 2018d as shown in fig 3b the three dimensional 3d hydrodynamic problem is changed into three water entry problems for heeled asymmetric wedge sections find the technical commented on the 2d t method in the published papers by sun and faltinsen 2010 2011 for each planing surface a water entry problem with a vertical speed of 8 w i v sin θ τ i i 1 2 3 is established the 2d water entry problem is solved from time 0 which corresponds to the intersection of the keel and calm water in the considered planing surface to t p which corresponds to the transom step section given by 9 t p i l

determination of the running attitudes of a heeled stepped hull by 2d t method has been shown in fig 4 the following steps are needed to be taken step1 a trim angle is guessed step2 a keel wetted length is guessed step3 water entry problem for each planing surface is solved section 3 2 2 step4 resistance force is computed equation 40 step5 the error of the heave equation f z δ ε is checked the keel wetted length is re guessed step 2 until the left side of heave equation converges to zero i e the lift and weight agree step6 the error of pitch equation f θ r θ ε is checked the trim angle is re guessed step 1 until the left side of pitch equation converges to zero i e the pitching moment vanishes 4 cfd model 4 1 computational approach the numerical modelling is performed by assuming that fluid is newtonian viscous and two phases air and water continuity and navier stokes ns equations govern on the fluid field as 41 u 0 42 t ρ e f f u ρ e f f u u t p t ρ e f f f b where u u x x y z t u y x y z t u z x y z t t is fluid velocity ρ e f f x y z t is the effective density p x y z t is the pressure t x y z t is the viscous stress tensor f b 0 0 g is the force due to gravity the stress tensor should be calculated with the realizable k ε model the air water flow is solved by using the volume of fluid method hirt and nichols 1981 the governing equation on the volume fraction parameter is given by 43 t α α u 0 where volume fraction parameter α varies between 0 pure air and 1 pure water and is used to find effective parameters dashtimanesh et al 2018 once the equations are solved the forces and moments acting on the vessels are found as 44 f s p σ n d s 45 m s p σ n r d s where σ is the normal stress tensor and s is the total area of the boat n is the normal unit vector the longitudinal components of the force f x is set to be the total resistance the vertical component of the force is the lift the moment also includes heeling and pitching moments during the simulation heave and pitch directions are set to be free and the equilibrium condition is found all equations are solved by finite volume method using a commercial cfd code siemens plm star ccm details of the numerical approach can be found in siemens plm star ccm user s guide version 14 02 010 cd adapco 2019 4 2 computational domain to provide the set up for the numerical simulation a computational domain is defined as shown in fig 5 an inlet boundary and an outlet boundary are defined at both ends of the domain water and air enter from the inlet boundary condition located at the right end of the domain a no slip boundary condition is set on the bottom and upper surfaces two side boundaries are defined which behave like an inlet patch the walls of the vessel are defined to behave like a wall on which no slip condition is satisfied a summary of boundaries is shown in table 3 moreover the dimensions of the domain and the location of the boat are set using the recommendations of ittc see ittc 7 5 02 02 01 the boat transom is located at 3 lpp far from the inlet the depth of the computational domain is 3 5 lpp the outlet boundary should be located 3 lpp from the hull the domain is 4 lpp wide water light gray is initially set to be at the rest note that technical information about dimension of the domain can be found in zou et al 2019 4 3 gridding methodology and mesh convergence to discretize the numerical domain the morphing mesh approach is combined with rigid dynamic motion the numerical grid is generated by using different types of grids including 1 surface remesher 2 prism layer mesher and 3 trimmer dashtimanesh et al 2019b the smallest grids are defined near the free surface and the vessel which are of interest an overview of the mesh is shown in the upper panel of fig 6 the wall function approach is used to model treatments of the fluid near the walls of the vessel in particular the all wall y model is used y is set to vary between 30 and 300 as shown in the middle panel of the fig 6 four different mesh including coarse corresponds to 432151 grids medium 625451 grids fine 802221 grids and finest 1011102 grids are considered mesh study is performed and it is found that the results converge for the medium mesh size a sample of the mesh study for resistance prediction of a double stepped planing hull at beam froude number of 4 36 is illustrated in the lower panel of fig 6 5 comparison analysis there is no available experimental laboratory data presenting the performance of double stepped planing hulls moving forward at the non zero heel angle to assess the accuracy of both 2d t and cfd models in the prediction of the performance of a heeled double steeped vessel two different validation studies are performed the first validation study focuses on the performance of a doubled stepped planing hull moving forward in symmetric condition running attitudes and resistance of the vessel are found and compared against experimental data the second validation study focuses on the modeling of a heeled non stepped ponding hull advancing in calm water the heeling moment and normal force acting on the vessel are computed and compared against experimental data the errors in prediction of any parameter like running attitudes or forces is computed using 46 e 2 d t or cfd a e x p a 2 d t or cfd a e x p 100 where exp stands for experimental measurements 5 1 double stepped planing hull with zero heel angle running attitudes and resistance of a doubled stepped planing hull model c2 are found using the 2d t method and cfd model results including the dynamic trim angle resistance and the wetted surface are presented in fig 7 the experimental data are also shown in the figure the comparison of the predicted dynamic trim angle against experimental measurements fig 7a shows that both cfd and 2d t models have reasonable accuracy in prediction of trim trim angles computed by the cfd model and 2d t method are seen to follow the experimental data but cfd circles is more accurate than 2d t method triangles the cfd model and the 2d t method predict the resistance of the double stepped planing boat with proper accuracy fig 7b at high speeds the 2d t model provides better accuracy the graphs corresponding to the predicted and measured wetted surface diverge from the experimental method note that the experimental results squares fluctuate to sum the cfd model used in the current research predicts the trim angle and resistance with average errors of 10 9 and 6 22 respectively table 4 one of the main reasons for the errors of the current cfd model is the technique morphing mesh used to model the dynamic motion of the boat the previous cfd researches have shown that other motion techniques like overset technique can decrease the errors in the prediction of the trim angle under 8 percent in most of the cases when the equilibrium condition of a planing hull is numerically simulated details can be found in de luca et al 2016 de marco et al 2017 and sukas et al 2017 besides the errors in prediction of the resistance can also be attributed to the dynamic technique used in the current research the over predictions in the trim angle which are resulted from the morphing mesh technique lead in over prediction of the resistance induced drag caused by hydrodynamic pressure in sum the morphing mesh technique has caused an extra error in the prediction of the trim angel and resistance which has also been reported by dashtimanesh et al 2018 which is needed to be further investigated in the future note that performing simulations with fixed trim angle and pitch can highly increase the accuracy of cfd model in computation of the resistance see e g in ferrando et al 2015 and ghadimi et al 2019b but such an assumption cannot help us to evaluate the effects of asymmetric condition on running attitudes of the vessel which is the main aim of the current paper the 2d t method predicts the trim angle with an average error of 20 8 note that this average error corresponds to the beam froude numbers ranging from 1 9 to 5 6 the smallest considered speed 4 05 m s corresponds to the beam froude number of 1 80 which is categorized as a semi planing speed not planing the 2d t method is not expected to work for this speed but we have performed simulations at all speeds to see how the method works for all experiments the largest error is seen to occur at the mentioned speed 2 07 m s if we only consider the range of applicability of the 2d t method fr 2 0 the average error drops to 18 3 one of the main reasons for the error is the method used to apply the effects of step on the sectional forces eq 29 this function is originally developed to apply the effects of the transom on the sectional force of a stepless boat but for the case of a stepped boat while the kutta condition zero pressure governs on the step step effects on the sectional force in its vicinity is less significant compared with a transom of a step boat because the wetted length of the lifting surface locating in front of the step is much smaller than the wetted length of the stepless boat when we use this function eq 29 the center of pressure might be predicted to be closer to the transom than what it is which may lead to under prediction of the trim angle to some degrees as a result the induced drag may also be under predicted besides for the case of a stepped boat side wetted area near the chine of the middle lifting surface may appear due to vortices this area is found not to result in any remarkable hydrodynamic pressure while it can marginally contribute to the resistance subsequently the resistance may be under predicted to some degrees it is necessary to provide new methods to predict the transom step reduction function with better accuracy in the future moreover to increase the accuracy of the current method especially in the prediction of the resistance some simplified methods for prediction of the wetted area located near the chine are needed to be proposed 5 2 heeled non stepped planing hull the asymmetric motion of a heeled planing hull experiments of judge and judge 2013 is replicated by using 2d t and cfd models the vertical force and the heeling moment are computed and compared against experimental data the performance of the vessel at different drafts η 3 0 5 0 75 1 1 25 and 1 5 computed by 51 η 3 t c u r r e n t t nomina l is found simulations are performed for frb 3 6 corresponding to the speed of 7 54 m s fig 8 displays the predicted and measured values of the lift force vs heel angle at different drafts the lift force increases by the increase in the heel angle at three smaller drafts at the two large drafts the vertical force decreases by the increase in the heel angle the panels of fig 8 illustrate that the results of both cfd and 2d t data fit with experimental data especially at three smaller drafts at the two larger drafts errors appear which can be not defiantly attributed to the larger wetted surface of the vessel i e larger pressure area can be a source of the error in the predictions this point needs to be investigated in detail in the near future the errors in the prediction of the lift force of the heeled non stepped planing boat are presented in table 5 showing that for most of the cases the vertical force is predicted by both 2d t method and cfd with an error under 10 percent the heeling moment of a heeled planing hull at frb 3 6 is computed by both 2d t and cfd methods comparisons of the predictions against experimental measurements are shown in fig 9 as evident the 2d t and cfd method predict the heeling moment with almost good accuracy in all cases some errors appeared at large heel angel of 20 which equal to the deadrise angle of the vessel in this condition the starboard of the vessel is touched by the vessel at all the wetted sections of the vessel both 2d t and cfd methods lead to errors in this condition increasing the accuracy of simulations at large heel angles should be considered in future studies in the next section where the main results are presented this heel angle is not modeled by both methods the errors corresponded to the 2d t and cfd methods in prediction of the heeling moment are shown in table 6 the good accuracy of both cfd and 2d t methods in prediction of running attitude of a doubled stepped planing boat and forces acting on a heeled non stepped planing hull show that both methods can be used to model performance of a heeled double stepped planing hull 6 results 6 1 comparison between 2d t method cfd a heeled doubled stepped planing hull is modeled by both 2d t and cfd methods results are compared against each other to see how different the results of these methods are three different beam froude numbers including 2 94 corresponding to the speed of 6 25 m s 3 83 corresponding to the speed of 8 13 and 4 32 corresponding to the speed of 9 18 m s along with three different heel angles of 5 10 and 15 are considered the symmetric conditions are also modeled note that the considered speeds correspond to the cases for which the errors of cfd and 2d t methods have seen to be smaller see table 4 the computed trim angles of the double stepped planing hull in symmetric and asymmetric planing conditions are shown in fig 10 results of both 2d t method circles and cfd triangles agree with each other in most of the cases results of 2d t method are seen to follow the experimental data at heel angles of 5 and 10 but at the heel angle of 15 trim angle of 2d t method and cfd model diverge from each other which shows that for the case of a doubled stepped planing hull at large heel angles 2d t method predicts larger normal forces this fact will be discussed in detail later the predicted values of the resistance of the model c2 in asymmetric conditions are found using the 2d t and cfd methods the results are displayed in fig 11 the values of the predicted resistance by the 2d t method are found to be larger than the predicted values of the resistance by cfd in zero heel condition as was seen earlier fig 7 at the non zero heel angles the results of 2d t and cfd methods are observed to be closer to each other and fit for most of the cases this point shows that in asymmetric condition 2d t method and cfd model provide similar results for the resistance of a double stepped planing hull while they might not fit at the zero heel angel condition it was earlier discussed that the emergence of the wetted area near the chine of the vessel which are not computed by the 2d t method can lead to this discrepancy between the computed resistance by the 2d t method and cfd model but when the vessel locates at a heel angle of ϕ this area is found to become smaller which will be shown later or even vanish in some cases subsequently the resistance computed by cfd and 2d t models match fig 12 displays the computed wetted surface of the doubled stepped planing hull model c2 by both 2d t and cfd methods results of this figure provide evidence that predicted wetted surface by cfd and 2d t methods agree with each other in most of the cases results of both methods diverge from each other at the largest beam froude number frb 4 32 and heel angle ϕ 15 it should be noted that the difference between predicted wetted surface by 2d t and cfd methods is larger at the largest heel angle imposing that when heel angle increases both methods show different behavior in the prediction of wetted surface it has been attempted to study the reason for this difference the related study is shown in the upcoming discussions in this sub section fig 13 shows the computed heeling moment of the double stepped planing hull at different heel angles the heeling moment of the doubled steeped planing hull is seen to decrease by the increase in froude number numerical predictions of cfd triangles agree with predictions of 2d t theory circles at most of the cases the largest differences between the results heeling moment of 2d t and cfd methods are observed at the largest heel angle where the 2d t method predict smaller heeling moment note that these differences are not significant and are about 24 percent in the most case panel c by the increase in the speed the predictions made by the cfd model and 2d t model fit overall by the increase in the speed the discrepancy between the heeling moment predicted by the cfd model and 2d t becomes smaller note that at the higher speeds the contribution of hydrodynamic pressure becomes dominant in such a situation the cfd model and 2d t method predict similar values for the heeling moment the top views of the wetted surface of the doubled stepped planing hull obtained by 2d t and cfd methods are shown in fig 14 note that the wetted surface of the zero heel condition is not shown in this figure the results show that the wetted surface of the middle planing surface is negligible this surface is almost dry in all cases and a small proportion of the area of this surface is wetted by water this implies that this surface doesn t contribute to generation of forces significantly the cfd model predicts extra wetted surfaces near the chine of the second and third surfaces which are not captured by the 2d t model as explained earlier these wetted areas are seen to emerge when the chine of the fore planing surface is not fully wetted see some similar discussion in the thesis of lee et al 2014 de marco et al 2017 have the attributed appearance of these wetted areas to the vortices path these wetted surfaces are seen not to have any significant contribution in the hydrodynamic lift but frictional forces caused by the shear stresses can occur there 2d t model cannot predict such forces and thus it can compute smaller resistance in the cases these wetted surfaces are large as seen by the increase in speed and heel angle these wetted surface the wetted surface around the chine become smaller this fact is consistent with what was observed in fig 11 i e the difference between the predicted resistance by the cfd model and 2d t model becomes smaller by the increase in the heel angel moreover at larger heel angles e g heel angle of 15 the predicted wetted surface of the fore planing hull by the 2d t method is larger which is consistent with the presented results in fig 12 where the 2d t computes larger wetted surface overall the 2d t method was found to have an average error of 18 4 in the prediction of the trim angle of the planing hull in zero heel the predicted trim angle by the 2d t method in the zero heel condition was highly different from the cfd model i e the 2d t model under predicts the trim angle while cfd model over predicts the trim angle at symmetric planing condition but it was seen that the results of both methods agree in the asymmetric conditions at most of cases the only significant differences of the predicted trim angle were observed at the heel angle of 15 fig 10d which were attributed to predicted wetted surface by the 2d t model fig 12d while it was seen that cfd and 2d t models predict different values for resistance in the symmetric condition both methods were found to compute similar resistance see fig 11 in asymmetric condition the analysis of the wetted surface pattern on the bottom of the stepped planing hulls showed that when wetted surfaces near the chine of the middle and rear bodies are notable predicted resistance by the cfd and 2d t models diverge such a condition is more probable in the symmetric condition but by the increase in the speed and heel angle these wetted surfaces near the chine are smaller and thus the predicted resistance by the cfd and 2d t models fit overall the predicted trim angle resistance wetted surface and heeling moment predicted by cfd and 2d t agree with each other at most of the cases the only difference is observed at large heel angle ϕ 15 where wetted surface and trim angle predicted by cfd and 2d t diverge from each other 6 2 effect of adding two steps on performance of heeled planing hull effects of steps on the performance of a heeled planing hull are studied by simulating the asymmetric motion of model c non stepped planing hull and c2 doubled stepped planing hull and then comparing results including dynamic trim angle resistance wetted surface and heeling moment against each other simulations are performed for the beam froude number ranging from 1 9 corresponding to the speed of 4 05 m s to 5 24 corresponding to the speed of 11 3 m s and three heel angles of 5 10 and 15 since 2d t and cfd methods provide almost similar results for the asymmetric planing see discussed in sub section 6 2 only the 2d t method is used to simulate the problem note that the 2d t method has been observed to work properly for the non stepped planing hull previously ghadimi et al 2017a the dynamic trim angle of the heeled non stepped filled circles and the double stepped planing hulls unfilled circles are shown in fig 15 the trim angle is seen to decrease by the increase in heel angle for both hulls note that ghadimi et al 2017 have similarly observed that the trim angle of a heeled planing hull is affected and reduces by the increase in heel angle the trim angle of the heeled double stepped planing hull is less affected by the increase in heel angle especially at smaller beam froude numbers e g at the beam froude number of 2 0 5 degrees change in the heel angle of non stepped planing hull causes a 1 0 degree reduction in trim angle compare filled circles of fig 15a b and c while for the case of a double stepped planing hull this reduction is seen to be under 0 2 the hydrodynamic force acting on the boat causes this behavior for the case of a doubled stepped planing boat the dominant force supporting the weight of the vessel is the hydrodynamic force at small beam froude numbers and hydrostatic force doesn t contribute remarkably whereas for the case of a non stepped planing hull see the pressure distribution discussion in dashtimanesh et al 2018 hydrostatic force has larger contribution an asymmetric condition i e non zero heel angle increases the hydrodynamic pressure significantly for the case of a non stepped planing hull further discussion is presented in the rest of this sub section fig 16 shows the values of computed resistance for the non stepped filled circles and the stepped unfilled planing hulls in the asymmetric condition the values of the resistance of both vessels are seen to increase by an increase in the speed as expected for any planing vessel fridsma 1969 the presence of non zero heel angles affect both vessels in different ways for the case of the non stepped planing hull non zero heel angles reduce the resistance at two smaller beam froude numbers frb 2 0 and 3 19 e g at beam froude number of 2 0 the resistance of the non stepped planing hulls decreases from 2 0 to 3 19 as the heel angle increases from 5 to 10 at larger beam froude numbers frb 3 83 the resistance of the non stepped planing hull increases by the increase in heel angle but for the case of a double stepped planing hull an increase in the heel angle causes slight reductions up to 10 percent in resistance at all beam froude numbers these results provide the evidence that the presence of two steps can manage a vessel to reach high speeds even in heeled planing motion because the resistance is not affected and is still far smaller than non stepped vessel a study of the wetted surface of both vessels at non zero heel angles which will be presented later improve our understanding of the resistance results the wetted surface of the doubled stepped and the non stepped planing hulls are presented in fig 17 the values of the wetted surface of both hulls reduce by the increase in beam froude number in the non zero heel condition an increase in heel angel reduces the wetted surface of the non stepped planing hull at two smaller beam froude numbers frb 1 9 and 2 94 at the larger beam froude numbers heel angle increases the wetted surface of the vessel this shows that when the speed is increased and the vessel rests at a non zero heel angle larger wetted surfaces are needed to support the weight of the vessel for the case of a doubled stepped planing hull however an increase in the value of the heel angle results in the reduction of the wetted surface which is not significant note that these results are consistent with the resistance results fig 16 comparisons between the heeling moment of both hulls at different heel angels and beam froude numbers are shown in fig 18 heeling moments of both vessels decrease by the increase in speed note that balsamo et al similarly observed that the heeling moment of a planing hull decreases by the increase in the speed of the vessel at heel angle of 5 the heeling moment of the non stepped planing hull filled circles is larger than heeling moment of double stepped planing hulls unfilled circles at the heel angle of the 10 the heeling moment of the non stepped planing hull is larger than the heeling moment of the double stepped planing hulls at beam froude numbers ranging from 1 9 to 3 83 at larger beam froude numbers the heeling moment of the double stepped planing hull becomes larger at heel angle of 15 the heeling moment of the double stepped planing hull is larger than the heeling moment of a non stepped planing hull at all speeds overall the results reveal that by the increase in speed and heel angle the heeling moment of the double stepped planing hull becomes larger than that of a non stepped planing hull the reason underlying this behavior is the hydrodynamic pressure which causes the dominant force in supporting the weight of the vessel when speed is increased and heel angle grows a larger difference between forces in starboard and port of the vessel appears the double stepped planing hull has three maximum pressure area while the non stepped has one which take larger forces in larger heel angle and speeds more evidence regarding this fact is presented in the fig 19 to increase the understanding of effects of heel angle on the heeling moment of both hulls hydrodynamic heeling moment and hydrostatic heeling moment of both hull at two heel angles of 5 and 15 and beam froude numbers of 2 94 and 5 24 are computed and shown in fig 19 the hydrostatic moment left panel of fig 19 of the doubled stepped filled circles planing hull is smaller at the larger beam froude number circles with dashed lines hydrostatic heeling moment significantly decreases the difference between the hydrostatic heeling moment of the doubled stepped hull and the non stepped planing hull become very small at this beam froude number in comparison with what it was at smaller beam froude number solid lines with circles hydrodynamic heeling moments right panel of both vessels decrease by the increase in speed solid lines are located above the dashed lines the double stepped planing hull has larger heeling moments at all conditions the interesting point is that at larger heel angles and higher beam froude numbers the hydrodynamic heeling moment of the doubled stepped planing hull is significantly larger than the hydrodynamic heeling moment of the non stepped planing hull which results in higher heeling moment which is the summation of hydrostatic and hydrodynamic heeling moments for the doubled steeped planing hull this fact supports what was observed in fig 18 7 conclusion in the current paper hydrodynamic of heeled doubled stepped planing hulls were studied it was aimed to provide a numerical method based on 2d t theory for performance prediction of heeled double stepped planing hull and investigate whether results of this method and cfd fit or not a secondary aim of the current research was to improve the understating of the effects of adding two steps on the bottom of a planing hull on its performance in non zero heel conditions the 2d t method was developed by using the theoretical solutions of water entry of a solid wedge a cfd set up was developed using fvm and vof the validity of both methods was assessed by comparing their results against previous experimental data in two steps in the first step the performance of a doubled stepped planing hull was predicted 2d t and cfd were found to provide predictions for the dynamic trim angle resistance and wetted surface with reasonable accuracy in the second step heel motion of a non stepped planing hull was modeled and it was shown that 2d t and cfd methods accurately predict the forces acting on the vessel hydrodynamic of a heeled doubled stepped planing hull was modeled using both the 2d t method and cfd cfd and the 2d t methods provided similar heeling moment and resistance at all speed and heel angles there was an agreement between mathematically and numerically computed trim angle and wetted surface at heel angels of the 5 and 10 but at a heel angle of 15 the trim angle and wetted surface computed by cfd and 2d t method diverged not significantly from each other by the increase in the speed but these differences didn t affect the heeling moment and resistance also while the predicted resistance by the 2d t method and cfd model were seen to be different in symmetric conditions they fit in the asymmetric condition the wetted surfaces near the chine of the middle and rear lifting surfaces which were not computed by the 2d t method were seen to become very small in the asymmetric condition which decreases the difference between predicted resistance by the 2d t method and cfd model in asymmetric condition 2d t method was used to model both doubled stepped and non stepped planing hulls the following conclusions were made when a non stepped planing hull locates at a non zero heel angle its dynamic trim angle is decreased at smaller speeds while it is increased at larger speeds but when a double stepped planing hull locates at a non zero heel angle its trim angle is not significantly reduced at high speeds an increase in the heel angle of a non stepped planing hull increases the resistance of the vessel since the wetted surface increases but for the case of a doubled stepped planing hull resistance and the wetted surface of the vessel are found to decrease at all speeds by the increase in heel angle the presence of three maximum pressure areas helps the double stepped to keep its speed at the higher range in non zero heel conditions heeling moment of a non stepped planing hull is larger than the heeling moment of the doubled stepped planing hull at early planing speeds but by the increase in the speed the hydrostatic heeling moment vanishes while hydrodynamic heeling moment becomes dominant in this condition the doubled stepped planing hull which is supported by larger hydrodynamic pressure

according to the wide offshore exploration and development for crude oil and natural gas in the past several decades jack up drilling rig as the most popular type of mobile offshore drilling unit modu due to its flexible characteristics in service was progressively constructed and employed jack up drilling rig which is bottom supported unit usually consists of a triangular hull three legs and a jacking system wang et al 2017 in general there are two typical kinds of leg structure truss and cylinder form as shown in fig 1 cylindrical leg structure as the main component of jack up rig with frequent self elevating plays an essential role for stiffness support and safety operation of working platform and its fabricated dimensional accuracy will significantly influence the operation cost and service life of whole jack up rig therefore it is the critical engineering problem to control and prevent the welding deformation between the rack and cylinder during the fabrication of cylindrical leg structure cotton et al cotton 1979 introduced the steel and its welding technology for offshore construction hamada et al 1982 from the kawasaki steel company presented the fabrication of steel components for strong offshore structures with high strength plates as well as leg structures of jack up rig pargeter 1989 examined the weldability of steels in particular high strength steels 690 n mm2 yield used in jack up drilling platforms such as leg structure chords and racks sharp et al 1999 reviewed the application of high strength steels with minimum yield strengths of 450 mpa for jack up construction mebelly et al mabelly et al 2001 later considered the welding residual stress during the fabrication of jack up with base material of e690 steel grade and its influence on the mechanical performance of welded structure zhou et al 2015 studied the fabrication accuracy problem of rack steel plates towards to offshore structure during the procedures of flame cutting flame heating when the rack was welded to the leg structure shen et al 2017 concentrated on the mitigation techniques such as pre shrinkage stiffness reinforcement symmetrical welding to correct the welding deformation and ensure the whole fabrication precision the influenced factors such as pre heating temperature welding speed constraint condition were examined for improving the fabrication precision of leg structures wang et al employed the elastic fe computational code based on welding inherent deformation to efficiently predict the welding deformation of hatch coaming of bulk carrier wang et al 2013a lightweight ship panel wang et al 2013b 2015 and cantilever beam structure of jack up rig wang et al 2017 and systemically reviewed the mitigation method for welding distortion prevention above mentioned literatures still didn t examine the welding distortion between the rack and cylinder even its influence on the cross section shape of cylindrical leg structure in this study the welding experiment was carried out in advance and welding distortion and shape change were also measured after the cooling down based on the effective tep fe computation with ism and openmp a simplified welding process was analyzed to understand and clarify the variation behavior mechanism of cross section shape of considered leg structure then due to the symmetrical characteristic quarter fe model of actual welded structure was used to predict the welding distortion good agreement between the measured date and computed results was obtained furthermore bead on plate welding on the inner surface of cylinder was numerically considered and examined to correct the cross section shape change caused by rack and cylinder welding 2 theory and method thermal elastic plastic tep fe computation is widely employed to investigate welding distortion of welded joint and simple welded structure for complex welded structure with multi pass welding some efficient tep fe approaches were presented and applied recently 2 1 thermal elastic plastic fe analysis generally there are two physical behaviors during welding process thermal process and the mechanical process which will be considered with thermal elastic plastic fe computation wang et al 2011 due to the decisive effect of thermal process on the mechanical process uncoupled thermal mechanical formulation is usually employed to examine the thermal mechanical behavior during welding process in which the contribution of transient temperature field to stress through linear thermal expansion as well as temperature dependent thermal physical and mechanical properties as shown in fig 2 the solving procedure consists of two steps wang et al 2014 ma et al 2016 the transient temperature distribution field is obtained by solving a partial differential equation of the conservation of energy as given by eq 1 during the heat transfer analysis at first the obtained transient temperature distribution is then applied as a thermal loading in the subsequent mechanical analysis and residual stresses plastic strains and welding distortion are computed in detail a partial differential equation of the conservation of momentum as given by eq 2 will be numerically solved during the mechanical analysis 1 ρ c d t d t κ t q 0 where t is the temperature and t is the temperature gradient q is the power per unit volume or the power density distribution k is the thermal conductivity c is thermal capacity and ρ is density these material properties are usually temperature dependent 2 d u u t u t u 2 b 0 where d means the fourth order elastic plastic tensor as a 6 6 matrix b is the body force and u is the displacement vector during thermal analysis initial temperature is often assumed to be ambient temperature and body heat source with uniform power density w m3 welding arc energy volume of body heat source is employed to model the heat source of welding arc which value is determined by heat input as well as welding condition as defined in eq 3 heat losses due to convection and radiation are also taken into account as heat flux boundary condition for all external surfaces ma et al 2016 heated elements are determined by origin of welding arc width height depth and length of welding heat source the initial stress often is assumed to be stress free and rigid body motion is usually prevented as boundary condition during mechanical analysis 3 q η u i v where η means thermal efficiency of welding arc u and i are welding voltage and welding current respectively v means welding velocity moreover in order to predict the welding deformation of thick plate with multi pass welding during the fabrication of cylindrical leg structure the iterative substructure method ism and parallel computation with openmp were employed to enhance the efficiency of conventional tep fe computation and an in house code was developed and implemented in the dell t420 server with 40 threads 2 2 iterative substructure method in physical behavior a local high intensity power source caused by moving welding arc is applied to the steel plates during the welding process and then generates a sharp thermal profile in the nearby region and results in non uniform distribution of plastic strains in the conventional fem analysis it is normal to consider the welding process as a non linear problem in the whole considered region and solve it for the entire process and total mesh domain actually elastic or weakly non linear analysis can be carried out for the region away from the welding arc when the current temperature is lower than input temperature parameter and the region with strongly non linear analysis moves together with the welding arc thus an iterative substructure method ism as shown in fig 3 was developed as a whole computational domain is divided into a weakly non linear region a strongly non linear region and boundary region which are all changing with the moving welding heat source nishikawa et al 2007 murakawa et al 2015 maekawa et al 2015 zhang et al 2007 meanwhile the stiffness matrix of the weakly non linear region is updated only when it is necessary to economize the computing time wang et al 2012 employed the thermal elastic plastic fe computation with ism to predict the twisting welding deformation during the fabrication of stiffened welded structure and good agreement between computed results and measurement was observed 2 3 parallel computation with openmp for the conventional tep fe analysis the program is programmed and compiled with single thread mode which cannot utilize the advantage of multi threads of high performance server to enhance the computational efficiency parallel computation with open multi processing technology was developed as a guided compilation processing scheme which can be implemented for multi threads cpu with shared memory operation system chandra et al 2001 then effective computation which was already accepted and employed for computational mechanics can be achieved by means of utilizing multi threads as shown in fig 4 with the openmp technology parallel computation is becoming much easier for researcher and scientist and the program can be supported with lots of computer language such as c c or fortran with 2 ranked matrices multiplication given in eq 4 as example parallel computation will transfer 2 ranked matrix to vectors and then vector multiplication is carried out simultaneously with different thread as demonstrated in eq 5 4 a 11 a 12 a 21 a 22 b 11 b 12 b 21 b 22 c 11 c 12 c 21 c 22 5 c 11 a 11 a 12 t b 11 b 21 c 12 a 11 a 12 t b 12 b 22 c 21 a 21 a 22 t b 11 b 21 c 22 a 21 a 22 t b 12 b 22 for the computational welding mechanics the reading and writing process are normally completing with single thread mode and operation of large range matrix is solved by openmp technology with multi threads mode ma 2016 in detail heat flux matrix during thermal analysis and mechanical stiffness matrix during mechanical analysis will be divided into sub matrices and arranged for different thread for parallel computation thus much more threads were employed for one computation and computing time can be significantly reduced 3 rack cylinder welding experiment and measurement the main dimension of actual cylindrical leg structure is 36 000 mm in the length 520t in weight as shown in fig 5 while the locations of measured sections were also illustrated thickness of cylinder is 110 mm 115mm and the material is grade of eh36 the dimensional feature of cross section is illustrated in fig 6 in which the outer and inner diameters are 4 200 mm and 3 980 mm respectively fig 6 also shows the geometrical feature of welded joint in detail there are four racks on the outer surface of cylinder as symmetrical distribution with 17 away from the upright center line as shown in fig 7 and fig 8 rack and cylinder were connected and fixed together with two 50 mm thickness plates and these two thick plates were welded to rack beforehand with enough precision and strength then they were welded to cylinder by means of v type welding groove and total 61 multipass welding seams symmetrically and simultaneously shielded metal arc welding smaw was employed and the welding condition was summarized in table 1 preheating temperature with induction heating is controlled about 150 c and inter pass temperature is controlled as about 200 c after the welding between rack and cylinder the measurement of welding distortion shows that the cross section shape of cylinder has a significant and obvious change due to the welding shrinkage on the outer surface in detail cross section of examined cylindrical leg structure was transformed from circle to elliptic as the distance between upper edge and lower edge in upright direction shrink about 20 mm and the distance between left edge and right edge in horizontal direction expand about 7 mm this kind of geometrical change caused by welding will influence the interaction between cylindrical leg structure and working platform even the operation performance and efficiency for whole jack up rig in detail fig 9 shows the cylinder straightness of four positions right left down and up points as indicated in fig 6 at each measured section after welding while the negative deformation means inward shrinkage and positive deformation means outward expansion currently rigidity of cylindrical leg structure was improved with inner rib ring as shown in fig 10 a or pillar stiffener as shown in fig 10 b to avoid the welding distortion and ensure the fabrication accuracy although this practical approach can prevent the welding distortion as shown in fig 11 with inner rib ring in actual fabrication the manufacturing cost and procedure will be increased and the total weight will be increased with about 40t when some rigidity support components cannot be removed it is desired to propose an advanced technique not only to control the welding deformation but also to decrease the fabrication cost and weight of cylindrical leg structure 4 welding distortion prediction with efficient tep fe computation for the multi pass welded joint large computer memory and computing time are required during tep fe analysis an effective tep fe computation with ism and parallel computation was proposed and employed for welding deformation prediction in addition solving domain of finite element model of examined welded structure was divided into two regions during mechanical analysis which are both updated with the moving of heating source as well as the procedure of filler metal adding to the welding pass nodal temperature evaluated during thermal analysis will be considered as the critical parameter to determine the size and location of strong non linear region in order to understand the mechanism of cross section change behavior of examined cylindrical leg structure after welding fabrication a simplified cylinder model with bead on plate welding on outer surface was investigated in advance then due to symmetrical feature and to reduce the computation consumption quarter fe model of rack and cylinder welded structure was created to predict the welding deformation and compare with experimental measurement 4 1 simplified cylinder model and mechanism clarification an identical dimension according to cylindrical leg structure without rack component was considered as shown in fig 12 and the total number of points and elements are 37 824 and 25 767 respectively multi pass bead on plate welding lines were performed on the outer surface and the length of welding line was assumed as 500 mm welding conditions as summarized in table 1 and material properties as shown in fig 13 are all identical comparing with experiment the inter pass temperature is considered as about 200 c for later fe computation fig 14 shows the contour plotting of highest temperature distribution as well as welded zone it also can be seen that welding arc has a little bit shallower penetration in the thickness direction comparing to the thickness of cylinder this kind of temperature distribution caused by welding will not shrink the examined cylinder perimeter but influence its shape as show in fig 15 original cross section shape of examined cylinder with yellow color was compared to deformed shape caused by welding with orange color it also can be seen that the cross section shape has welding distortion with shrinkage in upright direction and expansion in horizontal direction from the above computational results and explanation the mechanism of welding distortion generated during rack and cylinder joining on the cross sectional shape of cylindrical leg structure can be clearly understood meanwhile in order to demonstrate the efficiency of proposed methods during tep fe computation computational times with the fe model as shown in fig 12 were summarized and compared in table 2 in house fortran code was compiled with intel parallel studio xe 2011 based on the platform of ubuntu 14 04 os and dell poweredge t420 server it can be concluded that computing time during the thermal analysis can significantly be reduced to half using intel math kernal library intel mkl or openmp parallel computation with 10 threads and to quarter using both intel mkl and openmp parallel computation with 10 threads with much more tep fe computations computational efficiency was compared not only for thermal analysis but also for mechanical analysis as summarized in table 2 it can be found that parallel computation with openmp can significantly reduce the computational time and computational time of mechanical analysis can be reduced by 70 by earlier iterative substructure method and reduced by 82 by proposed iterative substructure method in addition the proposed iterative substructure method with parallel computation can reduce about 40 computational time comparing to earlier iterative substructure method 4 2 welding distortion prediction and validation in order to accurately predict the welding deformation and validate with measured data quarter fe model of rack and cylinder welded structure as shown in fig 16 was used because of geometrical symmetry and computation resource reduction in fig 16 there are 61 multipass welding seam with different color belong to 12 layers in v type welding groove and the welding passes located at the left and right of rack will be welded symmetrically and simultaneously the total point and element are 122 859 and 114 350 respectively the horizontal direction of points on line1 to line 2 and upright direction of points on line 3 to line 4 are all fixed to represent the symmetrical boundary condition and rigid body motion is also constrained as mechanical boundary condition with the welding condition as summarized in table 1 and temperature dependent material properties of eh36 as shown in fig 13 thermal analysis for multipass welding was carried out according to the actual welding procedure and sequence during the experiment fig 17 shows the computed contour plotting of highest temperature during the rack and cylinder welding it can be seen that predicted welded zone is almost identical to the designed weld groove and arc welding heat source a little bit penetrates the cylinder thickness as mentioned above this kind of temperature distribution will generate welding plastic strain in the outer surface and then influence the cross section shape of examined cylindrical leg structure appling the computed temperature profile as thermal loading mechanical analysis during welding was also carried out to compute the plastic strains and predict the welding deformation and residual stress concentrating on the cross section shape of cylinder fig 18 a shows that the left edge has a negative welding deformation in horizontal direction which means that the left edge expands outward with respect to origin in addition fig 18 b shows that the upper edge also has a negative welding deformation in upright direction which means that the upper edge shrinks inward with respect to origin dealing with the symmetrical characteristic fig 19 shows the cross section shape of examined cylindrical leg structure after rack and cylinder welding in which original and deformed shapes were marked with yellow and orange colors it is also can be seen that same deformation trends comparing with experiment observation although the computed welding deformation has identical tendency comparing with experimental observation it is still necessary to compare the magnitude of computed welding deformation and measured data computed welding deformation of points on line 2 as indicated in fig 16 with shrinkage feature was compared to measurement with inward trend as shown in fig 20 a in which good agreement can be observed similarly computed welding deformation of points on line 4 as indicated in fig 16 with expansion feature was compared to measurement with outward trend as shown in fig 20 b in which good agreement also can be observed noting to the comparison between measurement and computation the measured welding distortions are located to the sections as shown in fig 5 with total length of 36 000 mm and welding length of quarter fe model of rack and cylinder welded structure is 500 mm predicted welding distortion has a consistent feature and can be used to approximately consider the welding distortion configuration of weld structure fe model with actual length meanwhile ignoring the influence of welding end on measurement middle region of measured sections almost has a uniform magnitude which basically agrees with computed results 5 welding distortion mitigation with bead on plate techniques with the previous investigation tep fe computation can predict not only the deformed shape trend but also the magnitude of welding deformation due to the arc welding on outer surface and generated plastic strain the cross section shape has a significant and obvious change although flame heating is usually employed for welding distortion mitigation with reverse deformation wang et al 2013b ma et al 2016 variation of cross sectional shape of considered cylindrical leg structure after welding is dominantly decided by in plane shrinkage not angular distortion thus bead on plate welding on the inner surface is proposed to rapidly obtain much more transverse in plane plastic strain while plastic strain of considered point is determined by maximal temperature reached during the welding process and transverse plastic strains generated by adjacent welding line will be superposed luo et al 1997 when the bead on plate welding is performed on the inner surface with equivalent influence on cross section of cylindrical leg structure fabrication accuracy influenced by welding may be controlled a new quarter fe model of cylindrical leg structure with bead on plate welding on inner surface as shown in fig 21 was created and examined the welding conditions as summarized in table 1 temperature dependent material properties of eh36 as shown in fig 13 welding procedure and symmetrical boundary condition are all identical with the tep fe computation above mentioned by means of thermal analysis and mechanical analysis with considering the bead on plate welding on inner surface of cylinder fig 22 shows the contour plotting of highest temperature during the actual welding and bead on plate welding it can be seen that bead on plate welding on inner surface created a shallow welded zone and temperature distribution near the inner surface which also cannot change the perimeter of examined cylinder but can reduce the influence of welding deformation during rack and cylinder welding on the cross section shape of cylindrical leg structure furthermore when a number of 30 bead on plate welding passes on inner surface and directly under the rack welding region was practiced fig 23 a shows that welding deformation in upright direction was reduced from 2 03 mm to 0 55 mm by about 72 9 and welding deformation in horizontal direction was reduced from 1 84 mm to 0 49 mm by about 73 4 however when a number of 60 bead on plate welding passes on inner surface and directly under the rack welding region was practiced not only the welding distortion during rack and cylinder welding can be totally mitigated but also additional and unnecessary welding deformation with 0 79 mm in horizontal direction and 0 95 mm in upright direction generated as shown in fig 23 b in addition table 3 summarized the mitigation influence of bead on plate welding on inner surface of cylindrical leg with different welding passes it may be concluded that the employed technique with bead on plate welding on inner surface can significantly reduce the welding distortion during rack and cylinder welding and ensure cross section shape and the fabrication accuracy of cylindrical leg structure without complex processing schedule weight and cost increasing 6 conclusions in this research an efficient thermal elastic plastic fe computation based on ism and parallel computation with openmp technology was proposed beforehand and then was employed for mechanism clarification of cross sectional shape variation welding distortion prediction and mitigation with bead on plate welding by means of computational investigation during the fabrication of cylindrical leg structure with rack and cylinder welding the following conclusions are also obtained 1 the variation behavior of cross sectional shape of considered cylindrical leg structure during rack and cylinder welding was experimentally observed 2 generation mechanism of cross sectional shape variation after welding was clarified by computational investigation with simplified cylinder model by means of proposed efficient tep fe computation and its computational efficiency was also demonstrated 3 fabrication accuracy was investigated with a quarter fe model of actual rack and cylinder welded structure by means of proposed efficient tep fe computation good agreement was obtained by comparing the computed welding deformation with measurement 4 bead on plate welding with multi pass on inner surface of cylinder was numerically examined while welding deformations generated by rack and cylinder welding in both horizontal and upright directions can be significantly reduced to ensure the fabrication accuracy without weight and cost increasing declaration of competing interestcoi we declare that we do not have

density distribution k is the thermal conductivity c is thermal capacity and ρ is density these material properties are usually temperature dependent 2 d u u t u t u 2 b 0 where d means the fourth order elastic plastic tensor as a 6 6 matrix b is the body force and u is the displacement vector during thermal analysis initial temperature is often assumed to be ambient temperature and body heat source with uniform power density w m3 welding arc energy volume of body heat source is employed to model the heat source of welding arc which value is determined by heat input as well as welding condition as defined in eq 3 heat losses due to convection and radiation are also taken into account as heat flux boundary condition for all external surfaces ma et al 2016 heated elements are determined by origin of welding arc width height depth and length of welding heat source the initial stress often is assumed to be stress free and rigid body motion is usually prevented as boundary condition during mechanical analysis 3 q η u i v where η means thermal efficiency of welding arc u and i are welding voltage and welding current respectively v means welding velocity moreover in order to predict the welding deformation of thick plate with multi pass welding during the fabrication of cylindrical leg structure the iterative substructure method ism and parallel computation with openmp were employed to enhance the efficiency of conventional tep fe computation and an in house code was developed and implemented in the dell t420 server with 40 threads 2 2 iterative substructure method in physical behavior a local high intensity power source caused by moving welding arc is applied to the steel plates during the welding process and then generates a sharp thermal profile in the nearby region and results in non uniform distribution of plastic strains in the conventional fem analysis it is normal to consider the welding process as a non linear problem in the whole considered region and solve it for the entire process and total mesh domain actually elastic or weakly non linear analysis can be carried out for the region away from the welding arc when the current temperature is lower than input temperature parameter and the region with strongly non linear analysis moves together with the welding arc thus an iterative substructure method ism as shown in fig 3 was developed as a whole computational domain is divided into a weakly non linear region a strongly non linear region and boundary region which are all changing with the moving welding heat source nishikawa et al 2007 murakawa et al 2015 maekawa et al 2015 zhang et al 2007 meanwhile the stiffness matrix of the weakly non linear region is updated only when it is necessary to economize the computing time wang et al 2012 employed the thermal elastic plastic fe computation with ism to predict the twisting welding deformation during the fabrication of stiffened welded structure and good agreement between computed results and measurement was observed 2 3 parallel computation with openmp for the conventional tep fe analysis the program is programmed and compiled with single thread mode which cannot utilize the advantage of multi threads of high performance server to enhance the computational efficiency parallel computation with open multi processing technology was developed as a guided compilation processing scheme which can be implemented for multi threads cpu with shared memory operation system chandra et al 2001 then effective computation which was already accepted and employed for computational mechanics can be achieved by means of utilizing multi threads as shown in fig 4 with the openmp technology parallel computation is becoming much easier for researcher and scientist and the program can be supported with lots of computer language such as c c or fortran with 2 ranked matrices multiplication given in eq 4 as example parallel computation will transfer 2 ranked matrix to vectors and then vector multiplication is carried out simultaneously with different thread as demonstrated in eq 5 4 a 11 a 12 a 21 a 22 b 11 b 12 b 21 b 22 c 11 c 12 c 21 c 22 5 c 11 a 11 a 12 t b 11 b 21 c 12 a 11 a 12 t b 12 b 22 c 21 a 21 a 22 t b 11 b 21 c 22 a 21 a 22 t b 12 b 22 for the computational welding mechanics the reading and writing process are normally completing with single thread mode and operation of large range matrix is solved by openmp technology with multi threads mode ma 2016 in detail heat flux matrix during thermal analysis and mechanical stiffness matrix during mechanical analysis will be divided into sub matrices and arranged for different thread for parallel computation thus much more threads were employed for one computation and computing time can be significantly reduced 3 rack cylinder welding experiment and measurement the main dimension of actual cylindrical leg structure is 36 000 mm in the length 520t in weight as shown in fig 5 while the locations of measured sections were also illustrated thickness of cylinder is 110 mm 115mm and the material is grade of eh36 the dimensional feature of cross section is illustrated in fig 6 in which the outer and inner diameters are 4 200 mm and 3 980 mm respectively fig 6 also shows the geometrical feature of welded joint in detail there are four racks on the outer surface of cylinder as symmetrical distribution with 17 away from the upright center line as shown in fig 7 and fig 8 rack and cylinder were connected and fixed together with two 50 mm thickness plates and these two thick plates were welded to rack beforehand with enough precision and strength then they were welded to cylinder by means of v type welding groove and total 61 multipass welding seams symmetrically and simultaneously shielded metal arc welding smaw was employed and the welding condition was summarized in table 1 preheating temperature with induction heating is controlled about 150 c and inter pass temperature is controlled as about 200 c after the welding between rack and cylinder the measurement of welding distortion shows that the cross section shape of cylinder has a significant and obvious change due to the welding shrinkage on the outer surface in detail cross section of examined cylindrical leg structure was transformed from circle to elliptic as the distance between upper edge and lower edge in upright direction shrink about 20 mm and the distance between left edge and right edge in horizontal direction expand about 7 mm this kind of geometrical change caused by welding will influence the interaction between cylindrical leg structure and working platform even the operation performance and efficiency for whole jack up rig in detail fig 9 shows the cylinder straightness of four positions right left down and up points as indicated in fig 6 at each measured section after welding while the negative deformation means inward shrinkage and positive deformation means outward expansion currently rigidity of cylindrical leg structure was improved with inner rib ring as shown in fig 10 a or pillar stiffener as shown in fig 10 b to avoid the welding distortion and ensure the fabrication accuracy although this practical approach can prevent the welding distortion as shown in fig 11 with inner rib ring in actual fabrication the manufacturing cost and procedure will be increased and the total weight will be increased with about 40t when some rigidity support components cannot be removed it is desired to propose an advanced technique not only to control the welding deformation but also to decrease the fabrication cost and weight of cylindrical leg structure 4 welding distortion prediction with efficient tep fe computation for the multi pass welded joint large computer memory and computing time are required during tep fe analysis an effective tep fe computation with ism and parallel computation was proposed and employed for welding deformation prediction in addition solving domain of finite element model of examined welded structure was divided into two regions during mechanical analysis which are both updated with the moving of heating source as well as the procedure of filler metal adding to the welding pass nodal temperature evaluated during thermal analysis will be considered as the critical parameter to determine the size and location of strong non linear region in order to understand the mechanism of cross section change behavior of examined cylindrical leg structure after welding fabrication a simplified cylinder model with bead on plate welding on outer surface was investigated in advance then due to symmetrical feature and to reduce the computation consumption quarter fe model of rack and cylinder welded structure was created to predict the welding deformation and compare with experimental measurement 4 1 simplified cylinder model and mechanism clarification an identical dimension according to cylindrical leg structure without rack component was considered as shown in fig 12 and the total number of points and elements are 37 824 and 25 767 respectively multi pass bead on plate welding lines were performed on the outer surface and the length of welding line was assumed as 500 mm welding conditions as summarized in table 1 and material properties as shown in fig 13 are all identical comparing with experiment the inter pass temperature is considered as about 200 c for later fe computation fig 14 shows the contour plotting of highest temperature distribution as well as welded zone it also can be seen that welding arc has a little bit shallower penetration in the thickness direction comparing to the thickness of cylinder this kind of temperature distribution caused by welding will not shrink the examined cylinder perimeter but influence its shape as show in fig 15 original cross section shape of examined cylinder with yellow color was compared to deformed shape caused by welding with orange color it also can be seen that the cross section shape has welding distortion with shrinkage in upright direction and expansion in horizontal direction from the above computational results and explanation the mechanism of welding distortion generated during rack and cylinder joining on the cross sectional shape of cylindrical leg structure can be clearly understood meanwhile in order to demonstrate the efficiency of proposed methods during tep fe computation computational times with the fe model as shown in fig 12 were summarized and compared in table 2 in house fortran code was compiled with intel parallel studio xe 2011 based on the platform of ubuntu 14 04 os and dell poweredge t420 server it can be concluded that computing time during the thermal analysis can significantly be reduced to half using intel math kernal library intel mkl or openmp parallel computation with 10 threads and to quarter using both intel mkl and openmp parallel computation with 10 threads with much more tep fe computations computational efficiency was compared not only for thermal analysis but also for mechanical analysis as summarized in table 2 it can be found that parallel computation with openmp can significantly reduce the computational time and computational time of mechanical analysis can be reduced by 70 by earlier iterative substructure method and reduced by 82 by proposed iterative substructure method in addition the proposed iterative substructure method with parallel computation can reduce about 40 computational time comparing to earlier iterative substructure method 4 2 welding distortion prediction and validation in order to accurately predict the welding deformation and validate with measured data quarter fe model of rack and cylinder welded structure as shown in fig 16 was used because of geometrical symmetry and computation resource reduction in fig 16 there are 61 multipass welding seam with different color belong to 12 layers in v type welding groove and the welding passes located at the left and right of rack will be welded symmetrically and simultaneously the total point and element are 122 859 and 114 350 respectively the horizontal direction of points on line1 to line 2 and upright direction of points on line 3 to line 4 are all fixed to represent the symmetrical boundary condition and rigid body motion is also constrained as mechanical boundary condition with the welding condition as summarized in table 1 and temperature dependent material properties of eh36 as shown in fig 13 thermal analysis for multipass welding was carried out according to the actual welding procedure and sequence during the experiment fig 17 shows the computed contour plotting of highest temperature during the rack and cylinder welding it can be seen that predicted welded zone is almost identical to the designed weld groove and arc welding heat source a little bit penetrates the cylinder thickness as mentioned above this kind of temperature distribution will generate welding plastic strain in the outer surface and then influence the cross section shape of examined cylindrical leg structure appling the computed temperature profile as thermal loading mechanical analysis during welding was also carried out to compute the plastic strains and predict the welding deformation and residual stress concentrating on the cross section shape of cylinder fig 18 a shows that the left edge has a negative welding deformation in horizontal direction which means that the left edge expands outward with respect to origin in addition fig 18 b shows that the upper edge also has a negative welding deformation in upright direction which means that the upper edge shrinks inward with respect to origin dealing with the symmetrical characteristic fig 19 shows the cross section shape of examined cylindrical leg structure after rack and cylinder welding in which original and deformed shapes were marked with yellow and orange colors it is also can be seen that same deformation trends comparing with experiment observation although the computed welding deformation has identical tendency comparing with experimental observation it is still necessary to compare the magnitude of computed welding deformation and measured data computed welding deformation of points on line 2 as indicated in fig 16 with shrinkage feature was compared to measurement with inward trend as shown in fig 20 a in which good agreement can be observed similarly computed welding deformation of points on line 4 as indicated in fig 16 with expansion feature was compared to measurement with outward trend as shown in fig 20 b in which good agreement also can be observed noting to the comparison between measurement and computation the measured welding distortions are located to the sections as shown in fig 5 with total length of 36 000 mm and welding length of quarter fe model of rack and cylinder welded structure is 500 mm predicted welding distortion has a consistent feature and can be used to approximately consider the welding distortion configuration of weld structure fe model with actual length meanwhile ignoring the influence of welding end on measurement middle region of measured sections almost has a uniform magnitude which basically agrees with computed results 5 welding distortion mitigation with bead on plate techniques with the previous investigation tep fe computation can predict not only the deformed shape trend but also the magnitude of welding deformation due to the arc welding on outer surface and generated plastic strain the cross section shape has a significant and obvious change although flame heating is usually employed for welding distortion mitigation with reverse deformation wang et al 2013b ma et al 2016 variation of cross sectional shape of considered cylindrical leg structure after welding is dominantly decided by in plane shrinkage not angular distortion thus bead on plate welding on the inner surface is proposed to rapidly obtain much more transverse in plane plastic strain while plastic strain of considered point is determined by maximal temperature reached during the welding process and transverse plastic strains generated by adjacent welding line will be superposed luo et al 1997 when the bead on plate welding is performed on the inner surface with equivalent influence on cross section of cylindrical leg structure fabrication accuracy influenced by welding may be controlled a new quarter fe model of cylindrical leg structure with bead on plate welding on inner surface as shown in fig 21 was created and examined the welding conditions as summarized in table 1 temperature dependent material properties of eh36 as shown in fig 13 welding procedure and symmetrical boundary condition are all identical with the tep fe computation above mentioned by means of thermal analysis and mechanical analysis with considering the bead on plate welding on inner surface of cylinder fig 22 shows the contour plotting of highest temperature during the actual welding and bead on plate welding it can be seen that bead on plate welding on inner surface created a shallow welded zone and temperature distribution near the inner surface which also cannot change the perimeter of examined cylinder but can reduce the influence of welding deformation during rack and cylinder welding on the cross section shape of cylindrical leg structure furthermore when a number of 30 bead on plate welding passes on inner surface and directly under the rack welding region was practiced fig 23 a shows that welding deformation in upright direction was reduced from 2 03 mm to 0 55 mm by about 72 9 and welding deformation in horizontal direction was reduced from 1 84 mm to 0 49 mm by about 73 4 however when a number of 60 bead on plate welding passes on inner surface and directly under the rack welding region was practiced not only the welding distortion during rack and cylinder welding can be totally mitigated but also additional and unnecessary welding deformation with 0 79 mm in horizontal direction and 0 95 mm in upright direction generated as shown in fig 23 b in addition table 3 summarized the mitigation influence of bead on plate welding on inner surface of cylindrical leg with different welding passes it may be concluded that the employed technique with bead on plate welding on inner surface can significantly reduce the welding distortion during rack and cylinder welding and ensure cross section shape and the fabrication accuracy of cylindrical leg structure without complex processing schedule weight and cost increasing 6 conclusions in this research an efficient thermal elastic plastic fe computation based on ism and parallel computation with openmp technology was proposed beforehand and then was employed for mechanism clarification of cross sectional shape variation welding distortion prediction and mitigation with bead on plate welding by means of computational investigation during the fabrication of cylindrical leg structure with rack and cylinder welding the following conclusions are also obtained 1 the variation behavior of cross sectional shape of considered cylindrical leg structure during rack and cylinder welding was experimentally observed 2 generation mechanism of cross sectional shape variation after welding was clarified by computational investigation with simplified cylinder model by means of proposed efficient tep fe computation and its computational efficiency was also demonstrated 3 fabrication accuracy was investigated with a quarter fe model of actual rack and cylinder welded structure by means of proposed efficient tep fe computation good agreement was obtained by comparing the computed welding deformation with measurement 4 bead on plate welding with multi pass on inner surface of cylinder was numerically examined while welding deformations generated by rack and cylinder welding in both horizontal and upright directions can be significantly reduced to ensure the fabrication accuracy without weight and cost increasing declaration of competing interestcoi we declare that we do not have

22197,the mooring system may appear slack taut alternating transformation with the motion excitation of floating structure resulting in the dynamic tension amplitude of mooring line significantly increase based on the dynamic finite element analysis a series of sinusoidal excitations with different amplitudes and frequencies are applied at the top of mooring line and the results show that the slack taut phenomenon would occur when the top excitation reaches a certain amplitude and frequency the minimum value of tension is close to zero and the maximum value can reach several times of pre tension the spectrum analyses show that the components of high frequency appear besides the excitation frequency and the main factor affecting slack taut phenomenon of mooring line is the component of excitation along axial direction of mooring line through improving the initial pre tension selecting the cable with large elastic modulus and small cross section diameter and making the length of mooring line as short as possible these settings would have benefit for keeping mooring line in the taut state and avoid the occurrence of snap load the results of this paper would have significant reference for further exploring the mechanism of snap load in the mooring system and its design and safety assessment keywords taut mooring slack taut state snap load dynamic tension critical curve 1 introduction the structural features of mooring line are flexible and slender which can only resist tension rather than compression for different types of mooring line including the taut catenary semi taut when the motion of floating structure is drastic under the extreme ocean conditions the slack taut alternating phenomenon may occur in the mooring line which will significantly increase its dynamic tension the instantaneously increased dynamic tension is defined as snap load which can even reach several times of pre tension of mooring line the snap load may cause the break of mooring line which will invalidate mooring system and seriously affect the safety of floating structure a fiber rope of ship moored in hokkaido tomakomai port were broken due to snap load during the berthing process jtsb 2011 in 2011 two wire ropes of navion saga floating storage and offloading vessel got broken due to snap load kvitrud 2014 the destructive effect of snap load has led to research on various mooring cables used in marine engineering such as the vertical hanging segmented cable systems goeller and laura 1971 floating breakwater yamamoto 1981 offshore cranes niedzwecki and thampi 1991 submerged floating tunnel lu et al 2011 and floating offshore wind turbine masciola et al 2013 hsu et al 2017 the phenomenon of generating snap load in the mooring line has been investigated by some scholars through model tests niedzwecki et al 1991 experimentally studied the dynamic response of a multi component mooring line vertically suspended with heavy objects under the top sinusoidal displacement excitation with different excitation amplitudes and frequencies the results are processed in dimensionless manner and show that the mooring line transforms from taut state to slack taut state with the increase of excitation amplitude under the same excitation displacement amplitude the increase of excitation frequency also leads to the same result du et al 2003 conducted a model test on the dynamic behavior of single point moored vessel in narrow water and explored the influences of inflow velocities and mooring line lengths on the dynamic response of vessel and mooring line tension the results show that the mooring line tension is sensitive to the top excitation condition and the sudden snap load under vibration motion excitation may be an important cause of cable breakage vassalos et al 2004 studied the occurrence of snap load in mooring line under the slack taut state through experiments which compared the influences of mooring line length excitation amplitude and frequency on the snap load cao 2009 studied the influence factors of snap load in mooring line through model tests the taut mooring lines arranged with spar platform are tested in the 3 m depth wave flume and the sinusoidal displacement excitation is applied several influence factors such as the length diameter and materials of mooring line are studied in the model tests and the variation law is summarized zhang et al 2009a 2009b 2012 conducted a series of experimental researches on the snap load phenomenon of mooring line during slack taut process through applying simplified sinusoidal displacement excitation at the top of mooring line the slack taut process is simulated and the time histories of mooring line tension are analyzed the result shows that the snap load in mooring line is much larger than the dynamic tension under normal conditions the influence factors on the snap tension are investigated including the mooring line length stiffness material properties excitation amplitude and frequency meanwhile the phenomenon of generating snap load in the mooring line has been investigated by some scholars through numerical simulation huang and vassalos 1993 studied the occurrence of snap load in mooring line under the slack taut state through numerical analysis a lumped mass spring model of mooring line is established which considered the bilinear stiffness in the slack taut state transformation the large deformation of mooring line and the fluid force the modified euler method is used as the motion equation to solve the response of mooring line in time domain and the time history curves of displacement acceleration and axial force are obtained plaut et al 2000 studied the nonlinear dynamic response of a mooring rigid cylinder a massless spring model only considered the tension of mooring line is established and the dynamic response of cylinder is solved by the analytical method the influence factors such as hydrodynamic parameters pipe diameter ratio of buoyancy and weight installation angle and diameter of mooring line are also investigated and the occurrence conditions of snap load in mooring line are summarized the results show that the snap load occurs when the mooring line undergoes slack taut transformation and the tension amplitude increases significantly which are conducted the similar researches by lu et al 2011 and budiman et al 2016 hsu et al 2014 studied the snap load in mooring line of offshore floating wind turbines the characteristics of snap load are described and the probability distribution of snap load event in mooring line under the wind and wave conditions is studied by applying wind wave combination loads from different incident directions palm et al 2017 proposed an hp self adaptive discontinuous galerkin method to simulate the snap load in mooring line based on the conservation of momentum principle the motion equation of mooring line is established through dynamically adjusting the grid size h and the polynomial order p in hp self adaptive algorithm the occurrence of snap load in mooring line can be captured with high precision zhang et al 2017 studied the snap load in taut mooring line during slack taut process through the lumped mass method the occurrence condition of snap load is discussed by applying sinusoidal displacement excitation to the top of mooring lines in slack taut and slack taut states respectively the influences of initial pretension excitation amplitude and frequency drag coefficient and elastic modulus on the dynamic tension of mooring line are studied in this paper the motion responses of mooring line in slack taut process are investigated based on the finite element analysis software ansys 18 1 the hydrodynamic load of mooring line is considered and the kill switch function is used to simulate the slack taut process of mooring line through applying sinusoidal displacement excitation at the top of mooring line and adjusting the excitation amplitude and frequency the slack taut alternating transformation are simulated and the variation law of dynamic tension in mooring line is analyzed the influence factors including the initial pretension elastic modulus section diameter and length of mooring line are compared to summarize the occurrence of snap load 2 motion response solution of mooring line the dynamic tension in mooring line can be divided into the following equation 1 f f e x c i t f h y d p r e where f e x c i t is the tension induced by the excitation of upper floating structure motion f h y d is the tension induced by the hydrodynamic load acting on the mooring line including the wave load acting the upper of mooring line and the current load acting the whole mooring line while the wave load could be ignored due to its small proportion p r e is the static tension the mooring line is assumed to be fully flexible component in the response analysis of mooring line the motion equation is proposed by berteaux 1976 2 m m a v u t f d n f d t f i n f i t t g where m is the mass of mooring line per unit length m a is the added mass of mooring line per unit length v is the node velocity of mooring line u is the node velocity of current f d n and f d t are the normal and tangential drag force of mooring line per unit length respectively f i n and f i t are the normal and tangential inertial force of mooring line per unit length respectively t is the mooring line tension g is the wet weight of mooring line per unit length meanwhile f d n f d t f i n f i t is equivalent to f h y d and t g is equivalent to f e x c i t p r e in eq 1 the hydrodynamic load of mooring line could be calculated by morison equation 3 f d n 1 2 ρ w c d n d δ v n δ v n 4 f d t 1 2 ρ w c d t π d δ v t δ v t 5 f i n ρ w d 2 4 c m n 1 v u t 6 f i t ρ w d 2 4 c m t 1 v u t where ρ w is the seawater density c d n 1 2 and c d t 0 05 are the coefficient of normal and tangential drag force respectively c m n 1 0 and c m t 0 25 are the coefficient of normal and tangential added mass respectively the eq 2 is a complex nonlinear equation and the nonlinear finite element software ansys is used to calculate the dynamic tension of mooring line while the newton raphson iteration method is conducted to solve the nonlinear problem 3 finite element model 3 1 slack taut state simulation the link180 element in the finite element analysis software ansys is used to simulate the mooring line which can only sustain tensile and compressive stress the kill switch function is applied to the mooring line element so the element state of failure activation could be controlled which is used to simulate the slack taut process of mooring line during the analysis the procedure will judge the stress state of all mooring line elements at each calculation sub step and the element will be killed when its axial stress is less than or equal to 0 which means the mooring line element only can sustain tensile stress the killed element will be automatically multiplied a very small coefficient so that the stiffness of this element is nearly zero in the following calculation step the element will be re active if its axial stress is larger than 0 and the very small coefficient will be automatically cancelled so that the stiffness of this element is restored to normal state therefore the link180 element combined with kill switch function could be used to simulate the slack taut process of mooring line the mooring line with chain polyester chain segments is chosen as the research objective zhao 2011 and the properties are shown in fig 1 and table 1 the water depth is 1150 m and the initial installation angle at the fairlead is 450 after comparing the calculation accuracy and efficiency the element mesh size of upper and bottom chain is 1 m while the middle polyester is 50 m for fiber rope mooring lines the mechanical behaviors are relative complex such as the nonlinear stiffness and internal damping behaviors liu et al 2015 lian et al 2019 based on the handbook of offshore engineering chakrabarti 2005 the stiffness of polyester can be considered as three different constant values bedding in stiffness drift stiffness and storm stiffness in this paper the mooring line tension is the research objective so the constant storm stiffness of polyester is chosen to be used in the calculation 3 2 boundary condition the initial elastic stretch is applied aiming to keep the pre tension p re of mooring line and the specific process is as follows 1 the axial tensile force f pre is applied to the top of mooring line 2 the anchor point constraint is used and the steady state solution under axial tensile force f is conducted and the axial elongation of mooring line δ l is obtained 3 the anchor point constraint and the axial tensile force are both deleted and the axial displacement δ l along the mooring line axial direction which is the same as the initial installation angle 450 in the x o z coordinate is added at the anchor point and then the anchor point is re constraint 4 the tension at the top node of mooring line is extracted which need to be verified with p re the pre tension applied by this method can ensure that the initial stiffness of mooring line could be considered in the following motion responses analysis of mooring line under the top end displacement excitation the motion responses of mooring line are kept as the in plane motion x o z as shown in fig 1 so the boundary constraints of all nodes are u y 0 and the node at the anchor point and top end are u z 0 the displacement excitation u x a m sin 2 π f t is applied at the top end node of mooring line where a m and f are the excitation amplitude and frequency respectively the large deformation switch will also be opened in the motion responses analysis due to the large elastic elongation of mooring line 4 case study 4 1 calculation parameters set up the sinusoidal horizontal displacement excitation x t a sin 2 π f t is applied to the top end of mooring line at the origin of coordinates point o and the excitation direction is along the x axis as shown in fig 1 where a is the excitation amplitude and f is the excitation frequency after the preliminary calculation of dynamic responses of mooring line the slack taut phenomenon occurred when the pre tension pre 3e6n excitation amplitude a 2 0m and excitation frequency f 1 0 hz at this case the dynamic tension amplitude of mooring line significantly increases comparing with the pre tension in order to investigate the influences of pre tension elastic modulus section diameter and length on the dynamic tension of mooring line four types of calculation cases are conducted as shown in table 2 and the case 1 3 is chosen as the referenced case the second order wave slow drift forces acting on the floating platform can be divided into the sum frequency and difference frequency parts under the extreme wave conditions the motion responses of platform may introduce the high amplitude and high frequency so the excitation amplitude and frequency range are set as follows all of the cases are calculated under the excitation amplitude range of 1 0 10 0 m with an increment of 1 0 m and the excitation frequency range of 0 1 2 0 hz with an increment of 0 1 hz in order to capture the snap load generated during the slack taut process the time step of solution should be small enough and 200 load steps are set for each excitation period in this paper 4 2 variation of excitation frequency the influences of excitation frequency on the dynamic tension of mooring line are investigated the tension histories of case 1 3 under the excitation amplitude of 1 0 m and excitation frequencies of 0 1 0 4 0 8 1 0 1 4 2 0 hz are shown in fig 2 and the corresponding spectrum are shown in fig 3 according to fig 2 under the same pre tension and excitation amplitude the dynamic tension amplitude of mooring line gradually increases as the excitation frequency increases from 0 1 to 0 8 hz when the excitation frequency reaches 1 0 hz the dynamic tension amplitude increases significantly and the snap load is generated after that when the excitation frequency reaches 1 4 hz the dynamic tension amplitude starts to decrease then increases again at 2 0 hz in other word the dynamic tension amplitude does not gradually increase with the excitation frequency increases but shows a fluctuant increase trend according to fig 3 when the excitation frequency is at a lower excitation frequency 0 1 hz the frequency component of mooring line dynamic tension spectra is only the same as the excitation frequency with the increase of excitation frequency the multi high frequency components appear except the excitation frequency when the excitation frequency is 1 0 hz and 2 0 hz the frequency components show chaotic and the amplitude of tension spectrum increase significantly which is a noteworthy feature of generating snap load the motion trajectories of one node of mooring line under different excitation frequencies here the node at the top end of polyester is chosen are shown in fig 4 according to fig 4 a 4 f the motion trajectory of node starts from the initial equilibrium position point a and moves between the maximum and minimum motion boundary point b and c under the top end displacement excitation as shown in fig 4 a the envelope diagram of mooring line node motion trajectory can be described as an oval with the de direction along the axis of mooring line and the bc direction perpendicular to the axis of mooring line with the excitation frequency increases as shown in fig 4 a 4 c the motion trajectory shows relative regular oval feature which means the mooring line is in the taut state with the excitation frequency continues to increase as shown in fig 4 d the motion trajectory shows chaotic feature which means the mooring line is in the slack taut state and the node moves vigorously which the same as spectrum analysis are shown in fig 3 with the excitation frequency increases again as shown in fig 4 e the mooring line transforms into the taut state again and the motion trajectory also shows relative regular oval feature except the bc direction changes to the reverse compared with the mooring line in the first taut state with the excitation frequency continues to increase as shown in fig 4 f the motion trajectory shows chaotic feature again which means the mooring line is in the slack taut state and this phenomenon is similar to the resonance response meanwhile when the mooring line gradually transfers from the taut to slack taut state the angle between de and bc directions gradually decreases which indicates that the vibration of node gradually transforms from the perpendicular direction to mooring line axis toward the parallel direction that is the vibration component of node along the mooring line axis gradually increases it can be assumed that the excitation component along mooring line axis under the top end displacement excitation is the main cause of generating slack taut phenomenon in order to further verification the natural vibration modal analysis should be introduced under the axial direction constrained and unconstrained condition the constrained condition means the mooring line can only oscillate in the axial direction while the unconstrained condition means the mooring line can oscillate both in the axial and normal direction respectively as shown in table 3 according to table 3 and fig 3 the multi high frequency components are just the same as the natural frequency in axial direction under constrained condition while the first peak corresponds to the excitation frequency when the excitation frequency is just the same as the natural frequency the mooring line will transfer into slack taut state when the excitation frequency coincides with the 1st order natural in fig 3 d and the 2nd order natural frequency in fig 3 f and the snap load is generated due to the resonance response when the excitation frequency falls between the two order natural frequencies the mooring line will keep in taut state therefore it is confirmed that the excitation component along mooring line axis is the main cause of generating slack taut phenomenon 4 3 variation of excitation amplitude the influences of excitation amplitude on the dynamic tension of mooring line are investigated the tension histories of case 1 3 under the excitation frequency of 0 8 hz and excitation amplitudes of 3 0 6 0 m are shown in fig 5 and the corresponding spectrum and the motion trajectories of node at the top end of polyester are shown in fig 6 according to fig 5 and comparing with the referenced case 1 3 the calculation results are shown above under the same pre tension and excitation frequency the dynamic tension amplitude of mooring line gradually increases as the excitation amplitude increases from 1 0 to 6 0 m when the excitation amplitude is 1 0 m the mooring line is in the taut state and the mooring line is both in the slack taut state when the excitation amplitudes are 3 0 m and 6 0 m which indicates that the dynamic tension amplitude increases with the excitation amplitude increases according to fig 6 when the mooring line transfers into the slack taut state the amplitude of tension spectrum increase significantly which indicates again that is a noteworthy feature of snap load meanwhile when the excitation amplitude is 3 m the motion trajectory of node firstly goes through one regular oval and then enters chaotic state however when the excitation amplitude is 6 m the motion trajectory of node directly enters chaotic state this phenomenon indicates that the larger of excitation amplitude the shorter response time of mooring line entering into the slack taut state based on figs 5 and 6 when the pre tension and excitation frequency are constant the mooring line also can enter into the slack taut state from taut state as the excitation amplitude increases and the dynamic tension amplitude of mooring line gradually increases and then the snap load is generated 4 4 initial pre tension the influences of initial pre tension on the dynamic tension of mooring line are investigated the spectrum and the motion trajectories of node at the top end of polyester of case i under the excitation frequency of 0 8 hz and excitation amplitude of 3 0 m are shown in fig 7 according to figs 7 and 6 a under the same excitation frequency and excitation amplitude the mooring line gradually transfers from the slack taut state into taut state as the initial pre tension increases when the pre tension is at the relative small magnitude the multi high frequency components appear in the spectrum of mooring line except the excitation frequency and the node trajectories show chaotic feature which are the typical characteristics of slack taut state as the same as above when the pre tension is at the relative large magnitude the excitation frequency dominates the spectrum of mooring line and the node trajectories show relative regular oval feature which are the typical characteristics of taut state as the same as above the calculation results indicate that the higher pre tension has benefit for avoiding snap load in the mooring line 4 5 elastic modulus the influences of elastic modulus on the dynamic tension of mooring line are investigated the tension histories of case ii under the excitation frequency of 0 8 hz and excitation amplitude of 3 0 m are shown in fig 8 according to fig 8 under the same excitation frequency and excitation amplitude the mooring line is all in the slack taut state the dynamic tension amplitude of mooring line increases significantly and the snap load is generated the typical characteristics of slack taut state are also the same as the variation of excitation frequency and excitation amplitude shown above with the elastic modulus increases combined with all of the excitation cases as shown in the fig 13 a below the mooring line transforms into the slack taut state a little more difficultly 4 6 diameter the influences of diameter on the dynamic tension of mooring line are investigated the tension histories of case iii under the excitation frequency of 0 8 hz and excitation amplitude of 3 0 m are shown in fig 9 according to fig 9 under the same excitation frequency and excitation amplitude the mooring line is in the taut state when the diameter d 150 mm the mooring line gradually transforms into the slack taut state when the diameter d 175 mm or d 200 mm with the diameter increases the mooring line transforms from the taut state into slack taut state faster and the maximum dynamic tension becomes larger 4 7 length the influences of length on the dynamic tension of mooring line are investigated the tension histories of case iv under the excitation frequency of 0 8 hz and excitation amplitude of 3 0 m are shown in fig 10 according to fig 10 under the same excitation frequency and excitation amplitude the mooring line is in the taut state when the length l2 1300 m the mooring line gradually transforms into the slack taut state when the length l2 1450 m or l2 1600 m which indicates that the slack taut phenomenon occurs with the length of mooring line increases 5 critical curve of slack taut phenomenon occurring 5 1 maximum and minimum dynamic tension keeping the pre tension p 3e6n as constant the time histories of ten steady periodic mooring line tension values under different cases are summarized and the statistics of maximum and minimum dynamic tension are shown in fig 11 according to fig 11 when the excitation amplitude is smaller than 2 0 m in this paper the maximum dynamic tension is about several times of pre tension when the excitation frequency is nearby 1 0 hz and the minimum dynamic tension is close to zero with the excitation frequency continues to increase the maximum dynamic tension gradually decreases and increases once again when the excitation frequency is nearby 2 0 hz when the excitation amplitude is larger than 2 0 m in this paper the maximum dynamic tension is about several times of pre tension when the excitation frequency is nearby 1 0 hz and the minimum dynamic tension is close to zero however with the excitation frequency continues to increase the maximum dynamic tension only decreases slightly therefore when the excitation amplitude is at the relative small magnitude the maximum dynamic tension of mooring line increases volatility with the excitation frequency increases and the mooring line alternatively transforms between the slack taut and taut state when the excitation amplitude is at the relative high magnitude the maximum dynamic tension of mooring line keeps about several times of pre tension while the excitation frequency increases at certain value and the mooring line keeps in the slack taut state once the mooring line transforms into slack taut state the maximum dynamic tension increases significantly which means the snap load is generated 5 2 critical curve based on the results shown in section 5 1 the mooring line may transform between the taut and slack taut state when the excitation parameters changes at some certain values and sometimes also show the fluctuation transformation therefore the critical excitation frequency and amplitude of case i that could generate snap load under different pre tension is summarized in fig 12 and those of cases ii iv under different elastic modulus diameter and length are summarized in fig 13 according to fig 12 the critical curve could be divided into two parts the upper part of critical curve is the region that mooring line in the slack taut state and can generate snap load and the lower part of the critical curve is the region that mooring line in the taut state and cannot generate snap load the left part of first inflection point with the excitation frequency of 1 hz in fig 12 is the critical condition that the mooring line can transform into slack taut state at the first time so it is very important for the design of mooring line under the same excitation amplitude with the pre tension increases the critical excitation frequency that can generate snap load also increases and this means that the possibility of occurring slack taut in the mooring line becomes smaller under the same excitation frequency with the pre tension increases the critical excitation amplitude that can generate snap load also increases and this also means that the possibility of occurring slack taut in the mooring line becomes smaller meanwhile the mooring line under different pre tension is all prone to generate resonance response and snap load when the excitation frequency is nearby 1 0 hz and 2 0 hz according to fig 13 the same as fig 12 the upper part of the critical curve is the region that mooring line in the slack taut state and the lower part is the region that mooring line in the taut state combined with the modal analysis the parameters of elastic modulus diameter and length can both influence the stiffness of mooring line and hence influence the natural frequency in general the larger of elastic modulus the smaller of diameter and the shorter of length can both increase the stiffness of mooring line and hence cause the region of generating slack taut state becomes smaller which means they can decrease the possibility of occurring slack taut in the mooring line 6 conclusion in this paper the occurrence conditions for generating snap load in the mooring line is investigated through the calculation of dynamic tension under different excitation parameters and influence factors some conclusions are obtained 1 the slack taut state is well simulated through the kill switch function and the snap load can be generated during the transformation of slack taut state 2 the representative characteristics of generating snap load include the dynamic tension is about several times of pre tension the high frequency component appears in the dynamic tension spectrum except the excitation frequency and the node motion trajectory of mooring line becomes chaotic 3 the excitation component along mooring line axis under the top end horizontal displacement excitation is the main cause of generating slack taut phenomenon 4 the dynamic tension is very sensitive with the excitation frequency and amplitude and the maximum dynamic tension increases volatility there is a critical curve that the mooring line transforms between the taut and slack taut state under different excitation parameters 5 through increasing the pre tension the slope of critical curve that generating snap load becomes lager through increasing the elastic modulus or decreasing the length the critical curve that generating snap load is shifted to the right region through decreasing the diameter the critical curve that generating snap load is shifted to the upper region these measurements can both increase the stiffness of mooring line and hence cause the region of generating slack taut state becomes smaller which will decrease the possibility of occurring slack taut in the mooring

22197,the mooring system may appear slack taut alternating transformation with the motion excitation of floating structure resulting in the dynamic tension amplitude of mooring line significantly increase based on the dynamic finite element analysis a series of sinusoidal excitations with different amplitudes and frequencies are applied at the top of mooring line and the results show that the slack taut phenomenon would occur when the top excitation reaches a certain amplitude and frequency the minimum value of tension is close to zero and the maximum value can reach several times of pre tension the spectrum analyses show that the components of high frequency appear besides the excitation frequency and the main factor affecting slack taut phenomenon of mooring line is the component of excitation along axial direction of mooring line through improving the initial pre tension selecting the cable with large elastic modulus and small cross section diameter and making the length of mooring line as short as possible these settings would have benefit for keeping mooring line in the taut state and avoid the occurrence of snap load the results of this paper would have significant reference for further exploring the mechanism of snap load in the mooring system and its design and safety assessment keywords taut mooring slack taut state snap load dynamic tension critical curve 1 introduction the structural features of mooring line are flexible and slender which can only resist tension rather than compression for different types of mooring line including the taut catenary semi taut when the motion of floating structure is drastic under the extreme ocean conditions the slack taut alternating phenomenon may occur in the mooring line which will significantly increase its dynamic tension the instantaneously increased dynamic tension is defined as snap load which can even reach several times of pre tension of mooring line the snap load may cause the break of mooring line which will invalidate mooring system and seriously affect the safety of floating structure a fiber rope of ship moored in hokkaido tomakomai port were broken due to snap load during the berthing process jtsb 2011 in 2011 two wire ropes of navion saga floating storage and offloading vessel got broken due to snap load kvitrud 2014 the destructive effect of snap load has led to research on

1991 submerged floating tunnel lu et al 2011 and floating offshore wind turbine masciola et al 2013 hsu et al 2017 the phenomenon of generating snap load in the mooring line has been investigated by some scholars through model tests niedzwecki et al 1991 experimentally studied the dynamic response of a multi component mooring line vertically suspended with heavy objects under the top sinusoidal displacement excitation with different excitation amplitudes and frequencies the results are processed in dimensionless manner and show that the mooring line transforms from taut state to slack taut

on the dynamic behavior of single point moored vessel in narrow water and explored the influences of inflow velocities and mooring line lengths on the dynamic response of vessel and mooring line tension the results show that the mooring line tension is sensitive to the top excitation condition and the sudden snap load under vibration motion excitation may be an important cause of cable breakage vassalos et al 2004 studied the occurrence of snap load in mooring line under the slack taut state through experiments which compared the influences of mooring line length excitation amplitude and frequency on the snap load cao 2009 studied the influence factors of snap load in mooring line through model tests the taut mooring lines arranged with spar platform are tested in the 3 m depth wave flume and the sinusoidal displacement excitation is applied several influence factors such as the length diameter and materials of mooring line are studied in the model tests and the variation law is summarized zhang et al 2009a 2009b 2012 conducted a series of experimental researches on the snap load phenomenon of mooring line during slack taut process through applying simplified sinusoidal displacement excitation at the top of mooring line the slack taut process is simulated and the time histories of mooring line tension are analyzed the result shows that the snap load in mooring line is much larger than the dynamic tension under normal conditions the influence factors on the snap tension are investigated including the mooring line length stiffness material properties excitation amplitude and frequency meanwhile the phenomenon of generating snap load in the mooring line has been investigated by some scholars through numerical simulation huang and vassalos 1993 studied the occurrence of snap load in mooring line under the slack taut state through numerical analysis a lumped mass spring model of mooring line is established which considered the bilinear

spring model only considered the tension of mooring line is established and the dynamic response of cylinder is solved by the analytical method the influence factors such as hydrodynamic parameters pipe diameter ratio of buoyancy and weight installation angle and diameter of mooring line are also investigated and the occurrence conditions of snap load in mooring line are summarized the results show that the snap load occurs when the mooring line undergoes slack taut transformation and the tension amplitude increases significantly which are conducted the similar researches by lu et al 2011 and budiman et al 2016 hsu et al 2014 studied the snap load in mooring line of offshore floating wind turbines the characteristics of snap load are described and the probability distribution of snap load event in mooring line under the wind and wave conditions is studied by applying wind wave combination loads from different incident directions palm et al 2017 proposed an hp self adaptive discontinuous galerkin method to simulate the snap load in mooring line based on the conservation of momentum principle the motion equation of mooring line is established through dynamically adjusting the grid size h and the polynomial order p in hp self adaptive algorithm the occurrence of snap load in mooring line can be captured with high precision zhang et al 2017 studied the snap load in taut mooring line during slack taut process through the lumped mass method the occurrence condition of snap load is discussed by applying sinusoidal displacement excitation to the top of mooring lines in slack taut and slack taut states respectively the influences of initial pretension excitation amplitude and frequency drag coefficient and elastic modulus on the dynamic tension of mooring line are studied in this paper the motion responses of mooring line in slack taut process are investigated based on the finite element analysis software ansys 18 1 the hydrodynamic load of mooring line is considered and the kill switch function is used to simulate the slack taut process of mooring line through applying sinusoidal displacement excitation at the top of mooring line and adjusting the excitation amplitude and frequency the slack taut alternating transformation are simulated and the variation law of dynamic tension in mooring line is analyzed the influence factors including the initial pretension elastic modulus section diameter and length of mooring line are compared to summarize the occurrence of snap load 2 motion response solution of mooring line the dynamic tension in mooring line can be divided into the following equation 1 f f e x c i t f h y d p r e where f e x c i t is the tension induced by the excitation of upper floating structure motion f h y d is the tension induced by the hydrodynamic load acting on the mooring line including the wave load acting the upper of mooring line and the current load acting the whole mooring line while the wave load could be ignored due to its small proportion p r e is the static tension the mooring line is assumed to be fully flexible component in the response analysis of mooring line the motion equation is proposed by berteaux 1976 2 m m a v u t f d n f d t f i n f i t t g where m is the mass of mooring line per unit length m a is the added mass of mooring line per unit length v is the node velocity of mooring line u is the node velocity of current f d n and f d t are the normal and tangential drag force of mooring line per unit length respectively f i n and f i t are the normal and tangential inertial force of mooring line per unit length respectively t is the mooring line tension g is the wet weight of mooring line per unit length meanwhile f d n f d t f i n f i t is equivalent to f h y d and t g is equivalent to f e x c i t p r e in eq 1 the hydrodynamic load of mooring line could be calculated by morison equation 3 f d n 1 2 ρ w c d n d δ v n δ v n 4 f d t 1 2 ρ w c d t π d δ v t δ v t 5 f i n ρ w d 2 4 c m n 1 v u t 6 f i t ρ w d 2 4 c m t 1 v u t where ρ w is the seawater density c d n 1 2 and c d t 0 05 are the coefficient of normal and tangential drag force respectively c m n 1 0 and c m t 0 25 are the coefficient of normal and tangential added mass respectively the eq 2 is a complex nonlinear equation and the nonlinear finite element software ansys is used to calculate the dynamic tension of mooring line while the newton raphson iteration method is conducted to solve the nonlinear problem 3 finite element model 3 1 slack taut state simulation the link180 element in the finite element analysis software ansys is used to simulate the mooring line which can only sustain tensile and compressive stress the kill switch function is applied to the mooring line element so the element state of failure activation could be controlled which is used to simulate the slack taut process of mooring line during the analysis the procedure will judge the stress state of all mooring line elements at each calculation sub step and the element will be killed when its axial stress is less than or equal to 0 which means the mooring line element only can sustain tensile stress the killed element will be automatically multiplied a very small coefficient so that the stiffness of this element is nearly zero in the following calculation step the element will be re active if its axial stress is larger than 0 and the very small coefficient will be automatically cancelled so that the stiffness of this element is restored to normal state therefore the link180 element combined with kill switch function could be used to simulate the slack taut process of mooring line the mooring line with chain polyester chain segments is chosen as the research objective zhao 2011 and the properties are shown in fig 1 and table 1 the water depth is 1150 m and the initial installation angle at the fairlead is 450 after comparing the calculation accuracy and efficiency the element mesh size of upper and bottom chain is 1 m while the middle polyester is 50 m for fiber rope mooring lines the mechanical behaviors are relative complex such as the nonlinear stiffness and internal damping behaviors liu et al 2015 lian et al 2019 based on the handbook of offshore engineering chakrabarti 2005 the stiffness of polyester can be considered as three different constant values bedding in stiffness drift stiffness and storm stiffness in this paper the mooring line tension is the research objective so the constant storm stiffness of polyester is chosen to be used in the calculation 3 2 boundary condition the initial elastic stretch is applied aiming to keep the pre tension p re of mooring line and the specific process is as follows 1 the axial tensile force f pre is applied to the top of mooring line 2 the anchor point constraint is used and the steady state solution under axial tensile force f is conducted and the axial elongation of mooring line δ l is obtained 3 the anchor point constraint and the axial tensile force are both deleted and the axial displacement δ l along the mooring line axial direction which is the same as the initial installation angle 450 in the x o z coordinate is added at the anchor point and then the anchor point is re constraint 4 the tension at the top node of mooring line is extracted which need to be verified with p re the pre tension applied by this method can ensure that the initial stiffness of mooring line could be considered in the following motion responses analysis of mooring line under the top end displacement excitation the motion responses of mooring line are kept as the in plane motion x o z as shown in fig 1 so the boundary constraints of all nodes are u y 0 and the node at the anchor point and top end are u z 0 the displacement excitation u x a m sin 2 π f t is applied at the top end node of mooring line where a m and f are the excitation amplitude and frequency respectively the large deformation switch will also be opened in the motion responses analysis due to the large elastic elongation of mooring line 4 case study 4 1 calculation parameters set up the sinusoidal horizontal displacement excitation x t a sin 2 π f t is applied to the top end of mooring line at the origin of coordinates point o and the excitation direction is along the x axis as shown in fig 1 where a is the excitation amplitude and f is the excitation frequency after the preliminary calculation of dynamic responses of mooring line the slack taut phenomenon occurred when the pre tension pre 3e6n excitation amplitude a 2 0m and excitation frequency f 1 0 hz at this case the dynamic tension amplitude of mooring line significantly increases comparing with the pre tension in order to investigate the influences of pre tension elastic modulus section diameter and length on the dynamic tension of mooring line four types of calculation cases are conducted as shown in table 2 and the case 1 3 is chosen as the referenced case the second order wave slow drift forces acting on the floating platform can be divided into the sum frequency and difference frequency parts under the extreme wave conditions the motion responses of platform may introduce the high amplitude and high frequency so the excitation amplitude and frequency range are set as follows all of the cases are calculated under the excitation amplitude range of 1 0 10 0 m with an increment of 1 0 m and the excitation frequency range of 0 1 2 0 hz with an increment of 0 1 hz in order to capture the snap load generated during the slack taut process the time step of solution should be small enough and 200 load steps are set for each excitation period in this paper 4 2 variation of excitation frequency the influences of excitation frequency on the dynamic tension of mooring line are investigated the tension histories of case 1 3 under the excitation amplitude of 1 0 m and excitation frequencies of 0 1 0 4 0 8 1 0 1 4 2 0 hz are shown in fig 2 and the corresponding spectrum are shown in fig 3 according to fig 2 under the same pre tension and excitation amplitude the dynamic tension amplitude of mooring line gradually increases as the excitation frequency increases from 0 1 to 0 8 hz when the excitation frequency reaches 1 0 hz the dynamic tension amplitude increases significantly and the snap load is generated after that when the excitation frequency reaches 1 4 hz the dynamic tension amplitude starts to decrease then increases again at 2 0 hz in other word the dynamic tension amplitude does not gradually increase with the excitation frequency increases but shows a fluctuant increase trend according to fig 3 when the excitation frequency is at a lower excitation frequency 0 1 hz the frequency component of mooring line dynamic tension spectra is only the same as the excitation frequency with the increase of excitation frequency the multi high frequency components appear except the excitation frequency when the excitation frequency is 1 0 hz and 2 0 hz the frequency components show chaotic and the amplitude of tension spectrum increase significantly which is a noteworthy feature of generating snap load the motion trajectories of one node of mooring line under different excitation frequencies here the node at the top end of polyester is chosen are shown in fig 4 according to fig 4 a 4 f the motion trajectory of node starts from the initial equilibrium position point a and moves between the maximum and minimum motion boundary point b and c under the top end displacement excitation as shown in fig 4 a the envelope diagram of mooring line node motion trajectory can be described as an oval with the de direction along the axis of mooring line and the bc direction perpendicular to the axis of mooring line with the excitation frequency increases as shown in fig 4 a 4 c the motion trajectory shows relative regular oval feature which means the mooring line is in the taut state with the excitation frequency continues to increase as shown in fig 4 d the motion trajectory shows chaotic feature which means the mooring line is in the slack taut state and the node moves vigorously which the same as spectrum analysis are shown in fig 3 with the excitation frequency increases again as shown in fig 4 e the mooring line transforms into the taut state again and the motion trajectory also shows relative regular oval feature except the bc direction changes to the reverse compared with the mooring line in the first taut state with the excitation frequency continues to increase as shown in fig 4 f the motion trajectory shows chaotic feature again which means the mooring line is in the slack taut state and this phenomenon is similar to the resonance response meanwhile when the mooring line gradually transfers from the taut to slack taut state the angle between de and bc directions gradually decreases which indicates that the vibration of node gradually transforms from the perpendicular direction to mooring line axis toward the parallel direction that is the vibration component of node along the mooring line axis gradually increases it can be assumed that the excitation component along mooring line axis under the top end displacement excitation is the main cause of generating slack taut phenomenon in order to further verification the natural vibration modal analysis should be introduced under the axial direction constrained and unconstrained condition the constrained condition means the mooring line can only oscillate in the axial direction while the unconstrained condition means the mooring line can oscillate both in the axial and normal direction respectively as shown in table 3 according to table 3 and fig 3 the multi high frequency components are just the same as the natural frequency in axial direction under constrained condition while the first peak corresponds to the excitation frequency when the excitation frequency is just the same as the natural frequency the mooring line will transfer into slack taut state when the excitation frequency coincides with the 1st order natural in fig 3 d and the 2nd order natural frequency in fig 3 f and the snap load is generated due to the resonance response when the excitation frequency falls between the two order natural frequencies the mooring line will keep in taut state therefore it is confirmed that the excitation component along mooring line axis is the main cause of generating slack taut phenomenon 4 3 variation of excitation amplitude the influences of excitation amplitude on the dynamic tension of mooring line are investigated the tension histories of case 1 3 under the excitation frequency of 0 8 hz and excitation amplitudes of 3 0 6 0 m are shown in fig 5 and the corresponding spectrum and the motion trajectories of node at the top end of polyester are shown in fig 6 according to fig 5 and comparing with the referenced case 1 3 the calculation results are shown above under the same pre tension and excitation frequency the dynamic tension amplitude of mooring line gradually increases as the excitation amplitude increases from 1 0 to 6 0 m when the excitation amplitude is 1 0 m the mooring line is in the taut state and the mooring line is both in the slack taut state when the excitation amplitudes are 3 0 m and 6 0 m which indicates that the dynamic tension amplitude increases with the excitation amplitude increases according to fig 6 when the mooring line transfers into the slack taut state the amplitude of tension spectrum increase significantly which indicates again that is a noteworthy feature of snap load meanwhile when the excitation amplitude is 3 m the motion trajectory of node firstly goes through one regular oval and then enters chaotic state however when the excitation amplitude is 6 m the motion trajectory of node directly enters chaotic state this phenomenon indicates that the larger of excitation amplitude the shorter response time of mooring line entering into the slack taut state based on figs 5 and 6 when the pre tension and excitation frequency are constant the mooring line also can enter into the slack taut state from taut state as the excitation amplitude increases and the dynamic tension amplitude of mooring line gradually increases and then the snap load is generated 4 4 initial pre tension the influences of initial pre tension on the dynamic tension of mooring line are investigated the spectrum and the motion trajectories of node at the top end of polyester of case i under the excitation frequency of 0 8 hz and excitation amplitude of 3 0 m are shown in fig 7 according to figs 7 and 6 a under the same excitation frequency and excitation amplitude the mooring line gradually transfers from the slack taut state into taut state as the initial pre tension increases when the pre tension is at the relative small magnitude the multi high frequency components appear in the spectrum of mooring line except the excitation frequency and the node trajectories show chaotic feature which are the typical characteristics of slack taut state as the same as above when the pre tension is at the relative large magnitude the excitation frequency dominates the spectrum of mooring line and the node trajectories show relative regular oval feature which are the typical characteristics of taut state as the same as above the calculation results indicate that the higher pre tension has benefit for avoiding snap load in the mooring line 4 5 elastic modulus the influences of elastic modulus on the dynamic tension of mooring line are investigated the tension histories of case ii under the excitation frequency of 0 8 hz and excitation amplitude of 3 0 m are shown in fig 8 according to fig 8 under the same excitation frequency and excitation amplitude the mooring line is all in the slack taut state the dynamic tension amplitude of mooring line increases significantly and the snap load is generated the typical characteristics of slack taut state are also the same as the variation of excitation frequency and excitation amplitude shown above with the elastic modulus increases combined with all of the excitation cases as shown in the fig 13 a below the mooring line transforms into the slack taut state a little more difficultly 4 6 diameter the influences of diameter on the dynamic tension of mooring line are investigated the tension histories of case iii under the excitation frequency of 0 8 hz and excitation amplitude of 3 0 m are shown in fig 9 according to fig 9 under the same excitation frequency and excitation amplitude the mooring line is in the taut state when the diameter d 150 mm the mooring line gradually transforms into the slack taut state when the diameter d 175 mm or d 200 mm with the diameter increases the mooring line transforms from the taut state into slack taut state faster and the maximum dynamic tension becomes larger 4 7 length the influences of length on the dynamic tension of mooring line are investigated the tension histories of case iv under the excitation frequency of 0 8 hz and excitation amplitude of 3 0 m are shown in fig 10 according to fig 10 under the same excitation frequency and excitation amplitude the mooring line is in the taut state when the length l2 1300 m the mooring line gradually transforms into the slack taut state when the length l2 1450 m or l2 1600 m which indicates that the slack taut phenomenon occurs with the length of mooring line increases 5 critical curve of slack taut phenomenon occurring 5 1 maximum and minimum dynamic tension keeping the pre tension p 3e6n as constant the time histories of ten steady periodic mooring line tension values under different cases are summarized and the statistics of maximum and minimum dynamic tension are shown in fig 11 according to fig 11 when the excitation amplitude is smaller than 2 0 m in this paper the maximum dynamic tension is about several times of pre tension when the excitation frequency is nearby 1 0 hz and the minimum dynamic tension is close to zero with the excitation frequency continues to increase the maximum dynamic tension gradually decreases and increases once again when the excitation frequency is nearby 2 0 hz when the excitation amplitude is larger than 2 0 m in this paper the maximum dynamic tension is about several times of pre tension when the excitation frequency is nearby 1 0 hz and the minimum dynamic tension is close to zero however with the excitation frequency continues to increase the maximum dynamic tension only decreases slightly therefore when the excitation amplitude is at the relative small magnitude the maximum dynamic tension of mooring line increases volatility with the excitation frequency increases and the mooring line alternatively transforms between the slack taut and taut state when the excitation amplitude is at the relative high magnitude the maximum dynamic tension of mooring line keeps about several times of pre tension while the excitation frequency increases at certain value and the mooring line keeps in the slack taut state once the mooring line transforms into slack taut state the maximum dynamic tension increases significantly which means the snap load is generated 5 2 critical curve based on the results shown in section 5 1 the mooring line may transform between the taut and slack taut state when the excitation parameters changes at some certain values and sometimes also show the fluctuation transformation therefore the critical excitation frequency and amplitude of case i that could generate snap load under different pre tension is summarized in fig 12 and those of cases ii iv under different elastic modulus diameter and length are summarized in fig 13 according to fig 12 the critical curve could be divided into two parts the upper part of critical curve is the region that mooring line in the slack taut state and can generate snap load and the lower part of the critical curve is the region that mooring line in the taut state and cannot generate snap load the left part of first inflection point with the excitation frequency of 1 hz in fig 12 is the critical condition that the mooring line can transform into slack taut state at the first time so it is very important for the design of mooring line under the same excitation amplitude with the pre tension increases the critical excitation frequency that can generate snap load also increases and this means that the possibility of occurring slack taut in the mooring line becomes smaller under the same excitation frequency with the pre tension increases the critical excitation amplitude that can generate snap load also increases and this also means that the possibility of occurring slack taut in the mooring line becomes smaller meanwhile the mooring line under different pre tension is all prone to generate resonance response and snap load when the excitation frequency is nearby 1 0 hz and 2 0 hz according to fig 13 the same as fig 12 the upper part of the critical curve is the region that mooring line in the slack taut state and the lower part is the region that mooring line in the taut state combined with the modal analysis the parameters of elastic modulus diameter and length can both influence the stiffness of mooring line and hence influence the natural frequency in general the larger of elastic modulus the smaller of diameter and the shorter of length can both increase the stiffness of mooring line and hence cause the region of generating slack taut state becomes smaller which means they can decrease the possibility of occurring slack taut in the mooring line 6 conclusion in this paper the occurrence conditions for generating snap load in the mooring line is investigated through the calculation of dynamic tension under different excitation parameters and influence factors some conclusions are obtained 1 the slack taut state is well simulated through the kill switch function and the snap load can be generated during the transformation of slack taut state 2 the representative characteristics of generating snap load include the dynamic tension is about several times of pre tension the high frequency component appears in the dynamic tension spectrum except the excitation frequency and the node motion trajectory of mooring line becomes chaotic 3 the excitation component along mooring line axis under the top end horizontal displacement excitation is the main cause of generating slack taut phenomenon 4 the dynamic tension is very sensitive with the excitation frequency and amplitude and the maximum dynamic tension increases volatility there is a critical curve that the mooring line transforms between the taut and slack taut state under different excitation parameters 5 through increasing the pre tension the slope of critical curve that generating snap load becomes lager through increasing the elastic modulus or decreasing the length the critical curve that generating snap load is shifted to the right region through decreasing the diameter the critical curve that generating snap load is shifted to the upper region these measurements can both increase the stiffness of mooring line and hence cause the region of generating slack taut state becomes smaller which will decrease the possibility of occurring slack taut in the mooring

22198,this paper considers numerical predictions of wave induced motions and steady wave drift forces for ships in oblique waves the velocity potential around the ship is computed via a time domain rankine panel method based on the computed velocity potential the six degree of freedom wave induced motions were computed and then the second order wave loads were evaluated using a near field method an artificial soft spring system was employed to control horizontal ship motions the steady longitudinal and transverse wave drift forces and the steady yaw moment were computed for the kvlcc2 tanker

effects of the soft spring system on wave induced motions and steady wave drift forces demonstrated that although the increased stiffness of the system changed the corresponding motion response of the

wave drift forces besides the ordinary periodic wave forces wave drift forces are usually regarded as second order wave effects driven by the recent concern with fuel consumption the longitudinal steady wave drift force also referred to as the wave added resistance has been intensively investigated however only few studies considered the transverse steady wave drift force and the associated steady wave drift moment hereafter referred to as the steady sway force and the steady yaw moment respectively in severe seas the steady sway force and the steady yaw moment may attain considerable magnitudes leading to unexpected slip motions or heading changes of a ship and therefore significantly decreasing a ship s maneuverability in recent years maintaining the maneuverability of a ship in adverse weather conditions has received considerable attention indeed several research projects have been lunched to access the ship s maneuverability and safety in severe seas imo mepc 67 inf 22 2014 papanikolaou et al 2016 shigunov et al 2018 therefore the accurate prediction of the steady sway force and yaw moments is deemed important to reliably assess a ship s maneuverability the steady wave drift force and steady wave drift moment can either be measured during scale model tests or predicted using appropriate computer codes model tests are usually conducted in a rectangular water basin equipped with a wave maker several researches published their model test results for example naito et al 1991 measured the wave induced steady forces on a motion constrained tanker esso osaka advancing in oblique waves and compared their measurements to numerical results ueno et al 2000 measured the steady wave forces and moment acting on a maneuvering vlcc model in oblique waves without constraining the first order wave induced motions yasukawa and adnan 2006 provided the measured motion raos and steady drift forces for the s 175 container ship advancing in regular head and beam waves sprenger et al 2017 documented model test data of added resistance and drift forces for the kvlcc2 tanker at zero speed and the dtc container ship advancing at a moderate forward speed although physical model tests generally provide reliable data they must account for many wave related parameters such tests are costly and time consuming and it is difficult to consider the effects of all parameters therefore developing an accurate numerical method that predicts the steady sway force and steady yaw moment is timely typically potential theory based numerical methods are employed to predict second order wave loads the specific methods can be classified into two main categories namely the near field method and the far field method the near field methods of second order steady forces and moments acting on a ship in oblique regular waves were derived for instance by salvesen 1974 and faltinsen et al 1980 the far field method was introduced by maruo 1960 to calculate the steady wave drift forces on a freely floating body kashiwagi 1992 extended maruo s formula and derived formulas for the steady component of the wave induced sway force and yaw moment loukakis and sclavounos 1978 proposed another far field expression to calculate the added resistance and drift force for ship in oblique regular waves but their approach cannot compute the steady yaw moment skejic and faltinsen 2008 compared results obtained from different mean second order wave load theories they demonstrated that the steady sway force and yaw moment affect the maneuvering behavior of a ship in waves also using the far field method wicaksono and kashiwagi 2017 employed the enhanced unified theory and a new strip method to evaluate the kochin function and then they computed the steady forces and yaw moment of a ship advancing in oblique waves these above contributions relied on strip theory based velocity potentials recently however three dimensional potential solutions based numerical studies of second order wave loads have become popular joncquez 2009 derived near field and far field expressions of second order wave forces and moments and then validated the proposed expressions based on a rankine panel method seo and kim 2011 extended the near field method of joncquez 2009 to calculate the second order wave loads and evaluated the behavior of a maneuvering ship in regular waves also using a rankine panel method lyu and el moctar 2017 obtained added resistance and steady sway force and yaw moment coefficients for a containership and a cruise ship at ship heading angles between 0 and 180deg yasukawa et al 2018 computed the wave induced steady forces using a zero speed three dimensional panel method and a strip theory based kochin function method and compared results to experimental measurements in recent years cfd tools have been increasingly employed in seakeeping analyses thanks to the rapid development of computational techniques numerical investigations of wave added resistance based on the cfd approach were reported for instance by sadat hosseini et al 2013 tezdogan et al 2015 and sigmund and el moctar 2018 but very few cfd computations of the steady sway force and yaw moment are found in the literature in principle the cfd approach is suitable to predict the steady sway force and yaw moment because viscous effects of the flow are readily accounted for however the computational effort is still an obstacle for such cfd computations as the steady sway force and yaw moment are closely related to the ship s encounter angle in waves carrying out cfd computations at several encounter angles requires considerable computational effort often exceeding the available resources we computed the steady wave drift forces and the steady yaw moment acting on a ship in oblique waves using a time domain rankine panel method as the second order wave loads are related to first order wave induced motions the six degree of freedom 6dof motions of the ship were evaluated first then the wave induced steady sway force and yaw moment and the wave added resistance were computed based on a near field approach considering that there are no restoring forces for wave induced horizontal motions we employed a soft spring model to control the drift motions of the subject ships roll damping was estimated based on an empirical model we conducted our numerical computations for the kvlcc2 tanker at zero speed and the s 175 containership advancing in head and oblique waves we compared our numerical predictions to published experimental measurements and computations obtained from an existing seakeeping code moreover we assessed effects of the soft spring on first order wave motions and second order wave forces and moment 2 mathematical background 2 1 boundary value problem we consider a ship advancing at a constant forward speed u 0 in regular waves a mean body fixed right handed coordinate system o xyz describes the boundary value problem as shown in fig 1 the x axis points towards the ship s bow and the z axis points upward the origin of the coordinate system is located amidships χ denotes the wave encounter angle the hull is assumed rigid the wave induced rigid body translation and rotation are expressed as ξ t ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 and ξ r ξ 4 ξ 5 ξ 6 respectively here ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 are the translatory motions in the x y and z directions namely surge sway and heave and ξ 4 ξ 5 ξ 6 are the angular motions about the x y and z axes namely roll pitch and yaw the water is assumed incompressible and inviscid and the fluid motion is irrotational a total disturbance velocity potential ψ is introduced which satisfies the laplace equations 1 2 ψ 0 in fluid domain the exact boundary value problem bvp of finding the velocity potential ψ x t is nonlinear detailed nonlinear boundary conditions have been provided in our earlier paper zhang and el moctar 2019 following our previous approach we linearized the problem using a double body db linearization scheme the total disturbance velocity potential ψ x t is decomposed as follows 2 ψ x t u 0 x φ x ϕ i x t φ x t ϕ x t where x x y z φ x is the double body potential ϕ i x t is the incident wave potential φ x t and ϕ x t are the local potential and the memory potential respectively the db potential is assumed to be the main component of order o 1 while other parts are o ε here ε denotes a small quantity for example the ration between the incident wave amplitude to ship s beam it is assumed that ε 1 the db potential φ is determined from the following boundary conditions 3 φ n u n on s φ z 0 on z 0 where u u 0 0 0 s is the mean wetted hull surface n is the inward unit normal vector on s the incident wave potential for the infinite water depth is expressed by 4 ϕ i x t a g ω 0 e k z sin k x cos χ y sin χ ω e t where a is the wave amplitude ω 0 is the circular frequency g is the gravitational acceleration k ω 0 2 g is the wave number for deep water t is time and ω e is the encounter frequency defined as 5 ω e ω 0 u 0 ω 0 2 g cos χ the local potential φ x t models the instantaneous response of the fluid to the ship motions it is determined by the following bvp 6 φ n j 1 6 ξ j t n j ξ j m j on s φ 0 on z 0 where n j is the component of generalized normal vector 7 n 1 n 2 n 3 n n 4 n 5 n 6 x n and m j is the so called m terms newman 1979 we evaluate the m terms from the basic flow expressions 8 m 1 m 2 m 3 n u φ m 4 m 5 m 6 n x u φ in practice the second derivatives of φ x are computed using the numerical scheme proposed by wu 1991 the local potential φ x t can be further decomposed according the modes of the ship motions where each mode is defined as 9 φ i n i x ξ i t m i x ξ i t i 1 2 6 and ξ i t and ξ i t are velocity and displacement of mode i respectively the canonical potentials n i x and m i x satisfy the following boundary conditions 10 n i n n i m i n m i on s n i 0 m i 0 on z 0 the linearized bvp for the memory potential ϕ x t reads as follows 11 2 ϕ 0 ϕ ϕ t 0 at t 0 t u φ ζ 2 φ z 2 ζ ζ i ϕ z φ z φ ζ i on z 0 t u φ ϕ g ζ φ ϕ i on z 0 ϕ n ϕ i n on s radiation condition where ζ i x y t and ζ x y t are the wave elevation related to the incident wave potential and the memory potential respectively recall that the meanings of present local and memory potentials differ from the ones of the traditional time domain ship motion theory e g cummins 1962 bingham 1994 in fact present designation of memory local and canonical potentials are borrowed from kring 1994 as we will see in the following subsection the decomposition of the local potential φ x t and the memory potential ϕ x t separate hydrodynamic forces caused by instantaneous ship motions from hydrodynamic forces caused by free surface memory effects kring 1994 concluded that this treatment is necessary to avoid numerical instability in the integration of the equation of motion 2 2 equation of wave induced ship motion according to newton s law the 6dof equations of wave induced ship motions read as follows 12 j 1 6 m i j ξ j t c i j ξ j t f i ξ ξ ξ t i 1 2 6 where m i j and c i j are the mass and hydrostatic restoring coefficients respectively newman 1979 following the potential decomposition in 2 we consider the first order hydrodynamic pressure to comprise three parts 13 p 1 p l p m p i where the subscripts l m i identify the pressure related to the local potential to the memory potential and to the incident wave potential respectively these pressures are written as follows 14 p l ρ t u φ φ 15 p m ρ t u φ ϕ 16 p i ρ t u φ ϕ i the first order hydrodynamic forces are determined as follows 17 f i f i l f i w s p l n i d s s p m p i n i d s i 1 2 6 substituting 17 into 12 and introducing the following relationships 18 a i j l ρ s n j n i d s b i j l ρ s u φ n j m j n i d s c i j l ρ s u φ m j n i d s yields the following form of the equations of motion 19 j 1 6 m i j a i j l ξ j b i j l ξ j c i j c i j l ξ j f i w i 1 2 6 from 19 we see that the hydrodynamic forces related to ship motions are found on the left hand side of the equations as the canonical potentials n k x and m k x are time independent they can be solved and stored before computing the ship motions it should be mentioned here that employing the local potential is entirely motivated by the consideration of numerical stability it has no effect on saving the computational burden the time domain simulation of ship motions consists of iteratively solving the bvp of the memory potential 11 and the equations of motions 19 2 3 formulation of second order wave forces and moments the generalized second order hydrodynamic force f 2 f x 2 f y 2 f z 2 m x 2 m y 2 m z 2 is evaluated using the following near field pressure integration formula 20 1 ρ f

details to derive 20 see joncquez 2009 note that in equation 20 we have assumed the ship is wall sided the effects of flare angle are neglected in the terms of the waterline integration 3 numerical method in practice the memory potential was solved using a time domain rankine panel method while a fourth order adams predictor corrector scheme solves the motion of equation 19 details of numerical implementations are found in zhang and el moctar 2019 considering that the roll damping is closely related to the viscous hydrodynamic forces we determined the ship s roll damping according to the ittc s numerical estimation of roll damping procedure ittc 2011 the roll damping is divided into wave b w friction b f eddy b e and lift b l components 22 b 44 b w b f b e b l the wave damping component was already incorporated in our potential computation the other components comprised additional viscous rolling damping which was added in the equation of the ship s roll motion a non dimensional roll damping coefficient b ˆ 44 e x t is defined as follows 23 b ˆ 44 e x t b ˆ f b ˆ e b ˆ l b f b e b l ρ b 2 b 2 g the component b ˆ 44 e x t is evaluated according to the empirical formulas proposed by ittc 2011 for the time domain simulation of the wave induced horizontal motions i e surge sway and yaw some artificial mechanism needs to be introduced to restrict the drift motion of the ships to this end we used an artificial soft spring system in our numerical computation referring to chen and zhu 2010 three elements on the diagonal of the hydrostatic matrix in 19 are replaced by 24 c i i s i ω e 2 2 m i i i 1 2 6 where coefficients s i represent the stiffness of the spring 4 results and discussion we carried out numerical computations for the kvlcc2 tanker at zero forward speed and for the s 175 container ship at a forward speed corresponding to a froude number of fn 0 15 table 1 lists the principal particulars of subject ships whose lines plans are found in zhang and el moctar 2019 our time domain method obtained time histories of wave induced motions and wave drift forces and moment from the time harmonic part of the time histories we computed the response amplitude operator rao of ship motions and the time averaged steady wave drift forces and moment the phase angles of wave induced motions were specified relative to the incident wave at x 0 y

between incident wave and wave induced motion the respective normalized coefficients of the steady drift forces and moment are defined as follows 27 c x f x 2 ρ g a 2 b 2 l c y f y 2 ρ g a 2 b 2 l c n m z 2 ρ g a 2 b 2 where l is ship length between perpendiculars and b is ship breadth at the waterline we conducted temporal and spatial convergence checks for the tested ship hulls based on these tests we idealized their hulls with 800 surface panels and selected a common time step size of δ t 0 02 s for all simulations the free surface were truncated at 2 0l in the y direction 0 5l in the plus x direction and 1 4l in the minus x direction a typical computational domain consisted of about 6000 panels all computations were performed on a personal computer with an intel i5 7300 2 5 ghz processor for each case we performed the time domain simulations over fifteen encounter periods the computer time was about 75 min for the case of the lowest encounter frequency 4 1 wave induced 6dof ship motions of the kvlcc2 tanker for the kvlcc2 tanker we conducted numerical simulations at the six wave encounter angles of χ 30 60 90 120 150 and 180deg the tested wavelengths were in the region of 0 3 λ l 2 0 λ l is the ratio of wavelength to ship length the strength of the soft spring constant was s i 1 0 i 1 2 6 and the additional roll damping coefficient was set to b ˆ 44 e x t 0 002 fig 2 presents our predicted 6dof raos of the kvlcc2 tanker at zero speed our numerical results present are denoted by solid and dashed lines comparative results glr obtained from seakeeping code gl rankine by blue squares and red triangles the gl rankine code incorporated three different methods for the seakeeping analysis gourlay et al 2015 the method used for the results glr shown in fig 2 were obtained using the zero speed green function fig 2 shows that our predictions generally compared favorably to glr results minor discrepancies of surge sway roll and yaw motion raos in long waves λ l 1 5 were probably due to different techniques used to control horizontal motions and to estimate roll damping nevertheless the favorable agreement indicated that our code provided reasonably accurate results of first order hydrodynamic forces and ship motions 4 2 wave induced steady drift forces and yaw moment for the kvlcc2 tanker fig 3 plots the coefficient of the steady longitudinal drift force i e wave added resistance for the zero speed kvlcc2 tanker at the wave encounter angle of χ 180deg fig 4 plots the steady longitudinal drift force the steady sway force and the steady yaw moment for the zero speed kvlcc2 tanker at wave encounter angles of χ 30 60 90 120 and 150deg figs 3 and 4 compare our numerical results present with experimental measurements exp obtained from the shopera benchmark study of papanikolaou et al 2016 and numerical results glr obtained from code gl rankine the gl rankine results were computed using the zero speed green function coupled with a near field integration scheme fig 3 demonstrates the favorable comparison of our predictions to the gl rankine results for the steady longitudinal drift forces in moderate and long waves λ l 0 8 these two sets of the numerical results show similar variations with the experimental data although the predicted values are slightly higher than the experimental measurements in shorter waves λ l 0 7 differences occurred between the two sets of the numerical results however our predictions are closer to the experimental measurements than the results from the gl rankine code fig 4 shows that our predictions present of the steady longitudinal drift force compare fairly well to experimental data exp particularly at wave encounter angles of χ 90 and 120deg the longitudinal drift force from gl rankine glr is unreasonable for the steady transverse wave drift force our predictions present and the glr results show similar trends as the experimental data in the wavelength range of 0 7 λ l 1 5 our predictions are nearly identical to the glr results in shorter waves of λ l 0 6 the gl rankine results are closer to the experimental data at wave encounter angles of χ 60 90 and 120deg whereas our predictions are closer to the experimental data at χ 30 and 150deg we think that gl rankine and present method may face same difficulties for the short wave cases both these two code use linear theory whereas the nonlinear phenomenon such as wave breaking flow separation etc could be remarkable when the ship is in oblique short waves for better predictions of the wave drift forces moment nonlinear theory or cfd approaches should be considered nevertheless our present method was able to obtain reasonably accurate predictions of wave drift forces in the moderate wavelength range of 0 7 λ l 1 0 in waves of λ l 1 0 the steady transverse wave drift forces are almost zero for the wave induced steady yaw moment our results and the gl rankine results show similar predictions particularly at wave encounter angles of χ 90 120 and 150deg however as we didn t find reliable experimental data no further conclusion on the accuracy of the numerical results could be reached currently further studies are necessary to fully understand the wave induced steady yaw moment recall that the equation 20 of the second order wave forces and moment are based on linear theory thus they are valid for small amplitude incident waves and the associated wave induced motions as seen in fig 2 d in waves of λ l close to 2 0 the wave induced roll motion is significant the large roll motions do not satisfy the linear assumptions therefore our present method was unable to evaluate the wave drift forces and the yaw moment in long waves nevertheless this limitation was of relatively minor concern because the steady wave drift forces and yaw moment induced in long waves were relatively small 4 3 wave induced 6dof ship motions for the s 175 container ship for the s 175 container ship at a forward speed corresponding to the froude number of fn 0 15 we performed test simulations at wave encounter angles of χ 90deg beam seas and χ 180deg head seas in the wavelength range of 0 5 λ l 1 5 to compare our predictions to model test measurements of yasukawa and adnan 2006 we carried out numerical simulations for a 1 50 scale model of the ship we specified an additional roll damping coefficient of b ˆ 44 e x t 0 002764 and the restoring force parameters of the soft spring system as follows s 1 5 46 ω e 2 2 s 2 6 48 ω e 2 2 s 6 14 5 ω e 2 2 these parameters represented the restoring characteristics of the spring system used in the physical model test for additional details see yasukawa and adnan 2006 fig 5 plots wave induced surge heave and pitch raos of the s 175 container ship advancing at fn 0 15 in regular head waves as seen for the surge and pitch motions the agreements between our predictions present and experimental measurements exp are satisfactory however the peaks of our heave motions were overestimated this probably was caused by neglecting nonlinear effects huang 1997 reported similar results fig 6 plots comparative raos of our computed and the experimentally measured 6dof motions for the s 175 container ship advancing at fn 0 15 in regular beam waves as seen our predictions present captured the variations of wave induced motions plotted against the incident wave length in shorter waves our predicted surge and sway amplitudes are somewhat smaller than comparable experimental measurements in longer waves our predicted heave roll and yaw amplitudes are slightly smaller than the measured ones nevertheless the overall agreement between the predicted and measured 6 dof raos is generally acceptable 4 4 wave induced steady drift forces and yaw moment for the s 175 container ship fig 7 plots coefficient of the steady longitudinal drift force wave added resistance acting on the s 175 container ship advancing at fn 0 15 in regular head waves although there are some discrepancies the overall agreement between our predictions present and the experimentally measured data exp of yasukawa and adnan 2006 is satisfactory fig 8 plots the added resistance the steady sway force and the steady yaw moment for s 175 container ship advancing at fn 0 15 in regular beam waves together with comparable experimental measurements of yasukawa and adnan 2006 to be consistent with the model test results we transferred our computed steady yaw moment from the moment about the origin of the o xyz coordinate to the one about the center of gravity cog before comparing them to the experimentally measurements of yasukawa and adnan 2006 as seen in fig 8 our predicted steady sway force agrees well with experimental data and our predicted added resistance and yaw moment show similar trends as those from experimental measurements however the amplitudes of our numerical predictions of added resistance and yaw moment are smaller than comparable measured values the discrepancy was related to two aspects first there are non satisfactory first order motions results by the used numerical approach which decreased the accuracy of second order wave forces and moment predictions second when the ship is in beam waves the nonlinear phenomenon such as wave breaking and vortex generation at the ship s ends could be remarkable these nonlinearities were not captured by our method which prevented an accurate resolving of the flow field around the ends of the ship to obtain improved predictions of the added resistance and yaw moment it would have been necessary to account for these flow nonlinearities 4 5 effect of the soft spring on wave induced motions and wave drift forces for the ship in oblique waves the soft spring system may have affected the wave induced motions and the steady wave drift forces and moment as these effects were difficult to evaluate in physical tests we carried out numerical simulations to systematically investigate the influence of the soft spring system by varying the coefficient s i in the three elements of the diagonal hydrostatic restoring force 24 the so called s factors for the spring in the surge sway and yaw mode s i s i 1 2 6 this factor represents the stiffness of the soft spring system the increment of the s could be hereafter regarded as the stiffness enhancing of the soft springs our numerical tests were conducted for the s 175 container ship advancing at fn 0 15 in regular beam waves to demonstrate the effect of the soft spring on wave induced motions and wave drift forces we considered the four springs of s 0 5 1 0 3 0 and 5 0 figs 9 and 10 plot respectively the predicted wave induced 6dof raos and the associated phase angles as seen in fig 9 different strengths of the soft spring led to different predictions of surge sway and yaw raos particularly in long waves predicted motion raos increase rapidly at larger s factors because the soft spring s restoring force provided an extra stiffness to the ship motion system this extra stiffness increases the natural frequency of the system and correspondingly decreases the wave length at which resonance occurred as seen in fig 10 the soft spring affects the phase angles mainly in sway and yaw as the s factor increases the phase lag becomes larger however the predicted raos and phase angles converge as the s factor decreases the results for s 0 5 and s 1 0 almost coincide demonstrating that the influence of the spring is negligibly small as long as the spring is weak enough fig 11 plots coefficients of the wave induced steady drift forces and moment acting on the s 175 container ship advancing at fn 0 15 in regular beam waves computed using the different s factors of the soft spring system comparative experimental data of yasukawa and adnan 2006 are also included fig 11 as seen in fig 11 changing the strength of the soft spring also alters the second order forces and moment however the effect of the soft spring on second order forces is significantly less than the effect on first order wave induced motions indeed the numerical results of second order forces and moment predicted using s 0 5 and s 1 0 generally coincide with each other which is consistent with the results of first order motions shown in figs 9 and 10 moreover the predicted steady sway force and yaw moment decrease as the s factor increases in short waves of λ l 0 5 the results shown in figs 10 and 11 indicate that although the influence of the soft springs on first order motion in shorter waves is small they may still affect the second order force and moment because the phase angles of wave induced motions are changed 5 conclusions numerical prediction of wave induced motions and steady wave drift forces for ships in oblique waves was conducted using a time domain rankine panel method a soft spring system was employed to control the horizontal motions second order wave loads were evaluated using a near field approach the computed mean value of second order longitudinal and transverse forces and yaw moment represented the added resistance the steady sway force and the steady yaw moment respectively to validate our method we conducted numerical computations for the kvlcc2 tanker at zero forward speed and the s 175 containership at a forward speed corresponding to a froude number of fn 0 15 for the kvlcc2 tanker we considered six wave encounter angles for the s 175 containership only head and beam waves we compared our predictions to published experimental data and numerical results obtained from an existing seakeeping code the generally favorable agreement demonstrated that although there was room for improvement the computational accuracy of our developed method was acceptable form a practical perspective by employing springs of different stiffness to control the horizontal motions we tested their effect on wave induced first order motions and steady second order wave drift forces although the soft springs increased the stiffness of the system and changed the corresponding motion response their influence was negligibly small if the spring s stiffness was weak enough compared to first order motions wave drift forces and moment were less sensitive to the stiffness of the springs in shorter waves the increase of the spring s stiffness led to a decrease of the second order force and moment because the soft spring system changed the phase angle instead of the amplitude of the wave induced motions author contribution statement wei zhang conceptualization methodology software

rankine panel method based on the computed velocity potential the six degree of freedom wave induced motions were computed and then the second order wave loads were evaluated using a near field method an artificial soft spring system was employed to control horizontal ship motions the steady longitudinal and transverse wave drift forces and the steady yaw moment were computed for the kvlcc2 tanker at zero forward speed and for the s 175 containership at constant forward speed predicted results generally compared favorably to published experimental measurements a systematic analysis of the effects of the soft spring system on wave induced motions and steady wave drift forces demonstrated that although the increased stiffness of the system changed the corresponding motion response of the ships a spring s influence was negligibly small if its stiffness was weak enough keywords wave added resistance steady sway force steady yaw moment rankine panel method oblique waves second order wave

wave drift forces besides the ordinary periodic wave forces wave drift forces are usually regarded as second order wave effects driven by the recent concern with fuel consumption the longitudinal steady wave drift force also referred to as the wave added resistance has been intensively investigated however only few studies considered the transverse steady wave drift force and the associated steady wave drift moment hereafter referred to as the steady sway force and the steady yaw moment respectively in severe seas the steady sway force and the steady yaw moment may attain considerable magnitudes leading to unexpected slip motions or heading changes of a ship and therefore significantly decreasing a ship s maneuverability in recent years maintaining the maneuverability of a ship in adverse weather conditions has received considerable attention indeed several research projects have been lunched to access the ship s maneuverability and safety in severe seas imo mepc 67 inf 22 2014 papanikolaou et al 2016 shigunov et al 2018 therefore the accurate prediction of the steady sway force and yaw moments is deemed important to reliably assess a ship s maneuverability the steady wave drift force and steady wave drift moment can either be measured during scale model tests or predicted using appropriate computer codes model tests are usually conducted in a rectangular water basin equipped with a wave maker several researches published their model test results for example naito et al 1991 measured the wave induced steady forces on a motion constrained tanker esso osaka advancing in oblique waves and compared their measurements to numerical results ueno et al 2000 measured the steady wave forces and moment acting on a maneuvering vlcc model in oblique waves without constraining the first order wave induced motions yasukawa and adnan 2006 provided the measured motion raos and steady drift forces for the s 175 container ship advancing in regular head and beam waves sprenger et al 2017 documented model test data of added resistance and drift forces for the kvlcc2 tanker at zero speed and the dtc container ship advancing at a moderate forward speed although physical model tests generally provide reliable data they must account for many wave related parameters such tests are costly and time consuming and it is difficult to consider the effects of all parameters therefore developing an accurate numerical method that predicts the steady sway force and steady yaw moment is timely typically potential theory based numerical methods are employed to predict second order wave loads the specific methods can be classified into two main categories namely the near field method and the far field method the near field methods of second order steady forces and moments acting on a ship in oblique regular waves were derived for instance by salvesen 1974 and faltinsen et al 1980 the far field method was introduced by maruo 1960 to calculate the steady wave drift forces on a freely floating body kashiwagi 1992 extended maruo s formula and derived formulas for the steady component of the wave induced sway force and yaw moment loukakis and sclavounos 1978 proposed another far field expression to calculate the added resistance and drift force for ship in oblique regular waves but their approach cannot compute the steady yaw moment skejic and faltinsen 2008 compared results obtained from different mean second order wave load theories they demonstrated that the steady sway force and yaw moment affect the maneuvering behavior of a ship in waves also using the far field method wicaksono and kashiwagi 2017 employed the enhanced unified theory and a new strip method to evaluate the kochin function and then they computed the steady forces and yaw moment of a ship advancing in oblique waves these above contributions relied on strip theory based velocity potentials recently however three dimensional potential solutions based numerical studies of second order wave loads have become popular joncquez 2009 derived near field and far field expressions of second order wave forces and moments and then validated the proposed expressions based on a rankine panel method seo and kim 2011 extended the near field method of joncquez 2009 to calculate the second order wave loads and evaluated the behavior of a maneuvering ship in regular waves also using a rankine panel method lyu and el moctar 2017 obtained added resistance and steady sway force and yaw moment coefficients for a containership and a cruise ship at ship heading angles between 0 and 180deg yasukawa et al 2018 computed the wave induced steady forces using a zero speed three dimensional panel method and a strip theory based kochin function method and compared results to experimental measurements in recent years cfd tools have been increasingly employed in seakeeping analyses thanks to the rapid development of computational techniques numerical investigations of wave added resistance based on the cfd approach were reported for instance by sadat hosseini et al 2013 tezdogan et al 2015 and sigmund and el moctar 2018 but very few cfd computations of the steady sway force and yaw moment are found in the literature in principle the cfd approach is suitable to predict the steady sway force and yaw moment because viscous effects of the flow are readily accounted for however the computational effort is still an obstacle for such cfd computations as the steady sway force and yaw moment are closely related to the ship s encounter angle in waves carrying out cfd computations at several encounter angles requires considerable computational effort often exceeding the available resources we computed the steady wave drift forces and the steady yaw moment acting on a ship in oblique waves using a time domain rankine panel method as the second order wave loads are related to first order wave induced motions the six degree of freedom 6dof motions of the ship were evaluated first then the wave induced steady sway force and yaw moment and the wave added resistance were computed based on a near field approach considering that there are no restoring forces for wave induced horizontal motions we employed a soft spring model to control the drift motions of the subject ships roll damping was estimated based on an empirical model we conducted our numerical computations for the kvlcc2 tanker at zero speed and the s 175 containership advancing in head and oblique waves we compared our numerical predictions to published experimental measurements and computations obtained from an existing seakeeping code moreover we assessed effects of the soft spring on first order wave motions and second order wave forces and moment 2 mathematical background 2 1 boundary value problem we consider a ship advancing at a constant forward speed u 0 in regular waves a mean body fixed right handed coordinate system o xyz describes the boundary value problem as shown in fig 1 the x axis points towards the ship s bow and the z axis points upward the origin of the coordinate system is located amidships χ denotes the wave encounter angle the hull is assumed rigid the wave induced rigid body translation and rotation are expressed as ξ t ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 and ξ r ξ 4 ξ 5 ξ 6 respectively here ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 are the translatory motions in the x y and z directions namely surge sway and heave and ξ 4 ξ 5 ξ 6 are the angular motions about the x y and z axes namely roll pitch and yaw the water is assumed incompressible and inviscid and the fluid motion is irrotational a total disturbance velocity potential ψ is introduced which satisfies the laplace equations 1 2 ψ 0 in fluid domain the exact boundary value problem bvp of finding the velocity potential ψ x t is nonlinear detailed nonlinear boundary conditions have been provided in our earlier paper zhang and el moctar 2019 following our previous approach we linearized the problem using a double body db linearization scheme the total disturbance velocity potential ψ x t is decomposed as follows 2 ψ x t u 0 x φ x ϕ i x t φ x t ϕ x t where x x y z φ x is the double body potential ϕ i x t is the incident wave potential φ x t and ϕ x t are the local potential and the memory potential respectively the db potential is assumed to be the main component of order o 1 while other parts are o ε here ε denotes a small quantity for example the ration between the incident wave amplitude to ship s beam it is assumed that ε 1 the db potential φ is determined from the following boundary conditions 3 φ n u n on s φ z 0 on z 0 where u u 0 0 0 s is the mean wetted hull surface n is the inward unit normal vector on s the incident wave potential for the infinite water depth is expressed by 4 ϕ i x t a g ω 0 e k z sin k x cos χ y sin χ ω e t where a is the wave amplitude ω 0 is the circular frequency g is the gravitational acceleration k ω 0 2 g is the wave number for deep water t is time and ω e is the encounter frequency defined as 5 ω e ω 0 u 0 ω 0 2 g cos χ the local potential φ x t models the instantaneous response of the fluid to the ship motions it is determined by the following bvp 6 φ n j 1 6 ξ j t n j ξ j m j on s φ 0 on z 0 where n j is the component of generalized normal vector 7 n 1 n 2 n 3 n n 4 n 5 n 6 x n and m j is the so called m terms newman 1979 we evaluate the m terms from the basic flow expressions 8 m 1 m 2 m 3 n u φ m 4 m 5 m 6 n x u φ in practice the second derivatives of φ x are computed using the numerical scheme proposed by wu 1991 the local potential φ x t can be further decomposed according the modes of the ship motions where each mode is defined as 9 φ i n i x ξ i t m i x ξ i t i 1 2 6 and ξ i t and ξ i t are velocity and displacement of mode i respectively the canonical potentials n i x and m i x satisfy the following boundary conditions 10 n i n n i m i n m i on s n i 0 m i 0 on z 0 the linearized bvp for the memory potential ϕ x t reads as follows 11 2 ϕ 0 ϕ ϕ t 0 at t 0 t u φ ζ 2 φ z 2 ζ ζ i ϕ z φ z φ ζ i on z 0 t u φ ϕ g ζ φ ϕ i on z 0 ϕ n ϕ i n on s radiation condition where ζ i x y t and ζ x y t are the wave elevation related to the incident wave potential and the memory potential respectively recall that the meanings of present local and memory potentials differ from the ones of the traditional time domain ship motion theory e g cummins 1962 bingham 1994 in fact present designation of memory local and canonical potentials are borrowed from kring 1994 as we will see in the following subsection the decomposition of the local potential φ x t and the memory potential ϕ x t separate hydrodynamic forces caused by instantaneous ship motions from hydrodynamic forces caused by free surface memory effects kring 1994 concluded that this treatment is necessary to avoid numerical instability in the integration of the equation of motion 2 2 equation of wave induced ship motion according to newton s law the 6dof equations of wave induced ship motions read as follows 12 j 1 6 m i j ξ j t c i j ξ j t f i ξ ξ ξ t i 1 2 6 where m i j and c i j are the mass and hydrostatic restoring coefficients respectively newman 1979 following the potential decomposition in 2 we consider the first order hydrodynamic pressure to comprise three parts 13 p 1 p l p m p i where the subscripts l m i identify the pressure related to the local potential to the memory potential and to the incident wave potential respectively these pressures are written as follows 14 p l ρ t u φ φ 15 p m ρ t u φ ϕ 16 p i ρ t u φ ϕ i the first order hydrodynamic forces are determined as follows 17 f i f i l f i w s p l n i d s s p m p i n i d s i 1 2 6 substituting 17 into 12 and introducing the following relationships 18 a i j l ρ s n j n i d s b i j l ρ s u φ n j m j n i d s c i j l ρ s u φ m j n i d s yields the following form of the equations of motion 19 j 1 6 m i j a i j l ξ j b i j l ξ j c i j c i j l ξ j f i w i 1 2 6 from 19 we see that the hydrodynamic forces related to ship motions are found on the left hand side of the equations as the canonical potentials n k x and m k x are time independent they can be solved and stored before computing the ship motions it should be mentioned here that employing the local potential is entirely motivated by the consideration of numerical stability it has no effect on saving the computational burden the time domain simulation of ship motions consists of iteratively solving the bvp of the memory potential 11 and the equations of motions 19 2 3 formulation of second order wave forces and moments the generalized second order hydrodynamic force f 2 f x 2 f y 2 f z 2 m x 2 m y 2 m z 2 is evaluated using the following near field pressure integration formula 20 1 ρ f

details to derive 20 see joncquez 2009 note that in equation 20 we have assumed the ship is wall sided the effects of flare angle are neglected in the terms of the waterline integration 3 numerical method in practice the memory potential was solved using a time domain rankine panel method while a fourth order adams predictor corrector scheme solves the motion of equation 19 details of numerical implementations are found in zhang and el moctar 2019 considering that the roll damping is closely related to the viscous hydrodynamic forces we determined the ship s roll damping according to the ittc s numerical estimation of roll damping procedure ittc 2011 the roll damping is divided into wave b w friction b f eddy b e and lift b l components 22 b 44 b w b f b e b l the wave damping component was already incorporated in our potential computation the other components comprised additional viscous rolling damping which was added in the equation of the ship s roll motion a non dimensional roll damping coefficient b ˆ 44 e x t is defined as follows 23 b ˆ 44 e x t b ˆ f b ˆ e b ˆ l b f b e b l ρ b 2 b 2 g the component b ˆ 44 e x t is evaluated according to the empirical formulas proposed by ittc 2011 for the time domain simulation of the wave induced horizontal motions i e surge sway and yaw some artificial mechanism needs to be introduced to restrict the drift motion of the ships to this end we used an artificial soft spring system in our numerical computation referring to chen and zhu 2010 three elements on the diagonal of the hydrostatic matrix in 19 are replaced by 24 c i i s i ω e 2 2 m i i i 1 2 6 where coefficients s i represent the stiffness of the spring 4 results and discussion we carried out numerical computations for the kvlcc2 tanker at zero forward speed and for the s 175 container ship at a forward speed corresponding to a froude number of fn 0 15 table 1 lists the principal particulars of subject ships whose lines plans are found in zhang and el moctar 2019 our time domain method obtained time histories of wave induced motions and wave drift forces and moment from the time harmonic part of the time histories we computed the response amplitude operator rao of ship motions and the time averaged steady wave drift forces and moment the phase angles of wave induced motions were specified relative to the incident wave at x 0 y

between incident wave and wave induced motion the respective normalized coefficients of the steady drift forces and moment are defined as follows 27 c x f x 2 ρ g a 2 b 2 l c y f y 2 ρ g a 2 b 2 l c n m z 2 ρ g a 2 b 2 where l is ship length between perpendiculars and b is ship breadth at the waterline we conducted temporal and spatial convergence checks for the tested ship hulls based on these tests we idealized their hulls with 800 surface panels and selected a common time step size of δ t 0 02 s for all simulations the free surface were truncated at 2 0l in the y direction 0 5l in the plus x direction and 1 4l in the minus x direction a typical computational domain consisted of about 6000 panels all computations were performed on a personal computer with an intel i5 7300 2 5 ghz processor for each case we performed the time domain simulations over fifteen encounter periods the computer time was about 75 min for the case of the lowest encounter frequency 4 1 wave induced 6dof ship motions of the kvlcc2 tanker for the kvlcc2 tanker we conducted numerical simulations at the six wave encounter angles of χ 30 60 90 120 150 and 180deg the tested wavelengths were in the region of 0 3 λ l 2 0 λ l is the ratio of wavelength to ship length the strength of the soft spring constant was s i 1 0 i 1 2 6 and the additional roll damping coefficient was set to b ˆ 44 e x t 0 002 fig 2 presents our predicted 6dof raos of the kvlcc2 tanker at zero speed our numerical results present are denoted by solid and dashed lines comparative results glr obtained from seakeeping code gl rankine by blue squares and red triangles the gl rankine code incorporated three different methods for the seakeeping analysis gourlay et al 2015 the method used for the results glr shown in fig 2 were obtained using the zero speed green function fig 2 shows that our predictions generally compared favorably to glr results minor discrepancies of surge sway roll and yaw motion raos in long waves λ l 1 5 were probably due to different techniques used to control horizontal motions and to estimate roll damping nevertheless the favorable agreement indicated that our code provided reasonably accurate results of first order hydrodynamic forces and ship motions 4 2 wave induced steady drift forces and yaw moment for the kvlcc2 tanker fig 3 plots the coefficient of the steady longitudinal drift force i e wave added resistance for the zero speed kvlcc2 tanker at the wave encounter angle of χ 180deg fig 4 plots the steady longitudinal drift force the steady sway force and the steady yaw moment for the zero speed kvlcc2 tanker at wave encounter angles of χ 30 60 90 120 and 150deg figs 3 and 4 compare our numerical results present with experimental measurements exp obtained from the shopera benchmark study of papanikolaou et al 2016 and numerical results glr obtained from code gl rankine the gl rankine results were computed using the zero speed green function coupled with a near field integration scheme fig 3 demonstrates the favorable comparison of our predictions to the gl rankine results for the steady longitudinal drift forces in moderate and long waves λ l 0 8 these two sets of the numerical results show similar variations with the experimental data although the predicted values are slightly higher than the experimental measurements in shorter waves λ l 0 7 differences occurred between the two sets of the numerical results however our predictions are closer to the experimental measurements than the results from the gl rankine code fig 4 shows that our predictions present of the steady longitudinal drift force compare fairly well to experimental data exp particularly at wave encounter angles of χ 90 and 120deg the longitudinal drift force from gl rankine glr is unreasonable for the steady transverse wave drift force our predictions present and the glr results show similar trends as the experimental data in the wavelength range of 0 7 λ l 1 5 our predictions are nearly identical to the glr results in shorter waves of λ l 0 6 the gl rankine results are closer to the experimental data at wave encounter angles of χ 60 90 and 120deg whereas our predictions are closer to the experimental data at χ 30 and 150deg we think that gl rankine and present method may face same difficulties for the short wave cases both these two code use linear theory whereas the nonlinear phenomenon such as wave breaking flow separation etc could be remarkable when the ship is in oblique short waves for better predictions of the wave drift forces moment nonlinear theory or cfd approaches should be considered nevertheless our present method was able to obtain reasonably accurate predictions of wave drift forces in the moderate wavelength range of 0 7 λ l 1 0 in waves of λ l 1 0 the steady transverse wave drift forces are almost zero for the wave induced steady yaw moment our results and the gl rankine results show similar predictions particularly at wave encounter angles of χ 90 120 and 150deg however as we didn t find reliable experimental data no further conclusion on the accuracy of the numerical results could be reached currently further studies are necessary to fully understand the wave induced steady yaw moment recall that the equation 20 of the second order wave forces and moment are based on linear theory thus they are valid for small amplitude incident waves and the associated wave induced motions as seen in fig 2 d in waves of λ l close to 2 0 the wave induced roll motion is significant the large roll motions do not satisfy the linear assumptions therefore our present method was unable to evaluate the wave drift forces and the yaw moment in long waves nevertheless this limitation was of relatively minor concern because the steady wave drift forces and yaw moment induced in long waves were relatively small 4 3 wave induced 6dof ship motions for the s 175 container ship for the s 175 container ship at a forward speed corresponding to the froude number of fn 0 15 we performed test simulations at wave encounter angles of χ 90deg beam seas and χ 180deg head seas in the wavelength range of 0 5 λ l 1 5 to compare our predictions to model test measurements of yasukawa and adnan 2006 we carried out numerical simulations for a 1 50 scale model of the ship we specified an additional roll damping coefficient of b ˆ 44 e x t 0 002764 and the restoring force parameters of the soft spring system as follows s 1 5 46 ω e 2 2 s 2 6 48 ω e 2 2 s 6 14 5 ω e 2 2 these parameters represented the restoring characteristics of the spring system used in the physical model test for additional details see yasukawa and adnan 2006 fig 5 plots wave induced surge heave and pitch raos of the s 175 container ship advancing at fn 0 15 in regular head waves as seen for the surge and pitch motions the agreements between our predictions present and experimental measurements exp are satisfactory however the peaks of our heave motions were overestimated this probably was caused by neglecting nonlinear effects huang 1997 reported similar results fig 6 plots comparative raos of our computed and the experimentally measured 6dof motions for the s 175 container ship advancing at fn 0 15 in regular beam waves as seen our predictions present captured the variations of wave induced motions plotted against the incident wave length in shorter waves our predicted surge and sway amplitudes are somewhat smaller than comparable experimental measurements in longer waves our predicted heave roll and yaw amplitudes are slightly smaller than the measured ones nevertheless the overall agreement between the predicted and measured 6 dof raos is generally acceptable 4 4 wave induced steady drift forces and yaw moment for the s 175 container ship fig 7 plots coefficient of the steady longitudinal drift force wave added resistance acting on the s 175 container ship advancing at fn 0 15 in regular head waves although there are some discrepancies the overall agreement between our predictions present and the experimentally measured data exp of yasukawa and adnan 2006 is satisfactory fig 8 plots the added resistance the steady sway force and the steady yaw moment for s 175 container ship advancing at fn 0 15 in regular beam waves together with comparable experimental measurements of yasukawa and adnan 2006 to be consistent with the model test results we transferred our computed steady yaw moment from the moment about the origin of the o xyz coordinate to the one about the center of gravity cog before comparing them to the experimentally measurements of yasukawa and adnan 2006 as seen in fig 8 our predicted steady sway force agrees well with experimental data and our predicted added resistance and yaw moment show similar trends as those from experimental measurements however the amplitudes of our numerical predictions of added resistance and yaw moment are smaller than comparable measured values the discrepancy was related to two aspects first there are non satisfactory first order motions results by the used numerical approach which decreased the accuracy of second order wave forces and moment predictions second when the ship is in beam waves the nonlinear phenomenon such as wave breaking and vortex generation at the ship s ends could be remarkable these nonlinearities were not captured by our method which prevented an accurate resolving of the flow field around the ends of the ship to obtain improved predictions of the added resistance and yaw moment it would have been necessary to account for these flow nonlinearities 4 5 effect of the soft spring on wave induced motions and wave drift forces for the ship in oblique waves the soft spring system may have affected the wave induced motions and the steady wave drift forces and moment as these effects were difficult to evaluate in physical tests we carried out numerical simulations to systematically investigate the influence of the soft spring system by varying the coefficient s i in the three elements of the diagonal hydrostatic restoring force 24 the so called s factors for the spring in the surge sway and yaw mode s i s i 1 2 6 this factor represents the stiffness of the soft spring system the increment of the s could be hereafter regarded as the stiffness enhancing of the soft springs our numerical tests were conducted for the s 175 container ship advancing at fn 0 15 in regular beam waves to demonstrate the effect of the soft spring on wave induced motions and wave drift forces we considered the four springs of s 0 5 1 0 3 0 and 5 0 figs 9 and 10 plot respectively the predicted wave induced 6dof raos and the associated phase angles as seen in fig 9 different strengths of the soft spring led to different predictions of surge sway and yaw raos particularly in long waves predicted motion raos increase rapidly at larger s factors because the soft spring s restoring force provided an extra stiffness to the ship motion system this extra stiffness increases the natural frequency of the system and correspondingly decreases the wave length at which resonance occurred as seen in fig 10 the soft spring affects the phase angles mainly in sway and yaw as the s factor increases the phase lag becomes larger however the predicted raos and phase angles converge as the s factor decreases the results for s 0 5 and s 1 0 almost coincide demonstrating that the influence of the spring is negligibly small as long as the spring is weak enough fig 11 plots coefficients of the wave induced steady drift forces and moment acting on the s 175 container ship advancing at fn 0 15 in regular beam waves computed using the different s factors of the soft spring system comparative experimental data of yasukawa and adnan 2006 are also included fig 11 as seen in fig 11 changing the strength of the soft spring also alters the second order forces and moment however the effect of the soft spring on second order forces is significantly less than the effect on first order wave induced motions indeed the numerical results of second order forces and moment predicted using s 0 5 and s 1 0 generally coincide with each other which is consistent with the results of first order motions shown in figs 9 and 10 moreover the predicted steady sway force and yaw moment decrease as the s factor increases in short waves of λ l 0 5 the results shown in figs 10 and 11 indicate that although the influence of the soft springs on first order motion in shorter waves is small they may still affect the second order force and moment because the phase angles of wave induced motions are changed 5 conclusions numerical prediction of wave induced motions and steady wave drift forces for ships in oblique waves was conducted using a time domain rankine panel method a soft spring system was employed to control the horizontal motions second order wave loads were evaluated using a near field approach the computed mean value of second order longitudinal and transverse forces and yaw moment represented the added resistance the steady sway force and the steady yaw moment respectively to validate our method we conducted numerical computations for the kvlcc2 tanker at zero forward speed and the s 175 containership at a forward speed corresponding to a froude number of fn 0 15 for the kvlcc2 tanker we considered six wave encounter angles for the s 175 containership only head and beam waves we compared our predictions to published experimental data and numerical results obtained from an existing seakeeping code the generally favorable agreement demonstrated that although there was room for improvement the computational accuracy of our developed method was acceptable form a practical perspective by employing springs of different stiffness to control the horizontal motions we tested their effect on wave induced first order motions and steady second order wave drift forces although the soft springs increased the stiffness of the system and changed the corresponding motion response their influence was negligibly small if the spring s stiffness was weak enough compared to first order motions wave drift forces and moment were less sensitive to the stiffness of the springs in shorter waves the increase of the spring s stiffness led to a decrease of the second order force and moment because the soft spring system changed the phase angle instead of the amplitude of the wave induced motions author contribution statement wei zhang conceptualization methodology software

2019a b wei et al 2019 the typhoon process is essentially a process of strong air sea interaction on the one hand the physical process of typhoon suction and entrainment brings cold water to the mixed layer through the upwelling which makes the sea surface temperature sst significantly reduced nakamura et al 2016 kanada et al 2017 pun et al 2018 on the other hand the reduced sst also reduces the transfer of latent and sensible heat of the sea to the air and also reduces the intensity of the typhoon kolstad et al 2016 wu et al 2019c sun et al 2019 the response mechanism of the oceans to typhoons can be considered from two aspects first the typhoon driven mesoscale three dimensional ocean circulation will have a significant impact on the local dynamics and thermal processes zhang et al 2016 chen et al 2017 sun et al 2019 the resulting near inertial internal waves and vortices can input a large amount of mechanical energy into the ocean thus significantly enhancing the local ocean mixes and changes the thermohaline structure of the upper ocean lu et al 2016 wang et al 2016 yang et al 2019 second in the interior ocean the energy input into the ocean by typhoons in the form of near inertial internal waves travels along the oceanic thermocline to the distant such as the tropical pacific mei et al 2015 pei et al 2015 during the propagation process they interact nonlinearly with the original internal waves and near inertial oscillations inside the ocean which affects the ocean basin scale and even the global energy distribution and leads to an increase in ocean mixing rate in some specific regions the state of the art models have a good forecasting ability for the typhoon track but the forecast of typhoon intensity is still a recognized problem in the international meteorological community jin et al 2008 wu and zhao 2012 bender et al 2017 wu et al 2019d the reason is that besides the understanding of the atmospheric environment and the structure of the typhoon itself is not accurate enough it is also one of the important reasons for the lack of understanding of the complexity and feedback of related ocean dynamics and thermal processes wei et al 2017 kuo et al 2018 when the typhoon transits it exerts great shearing force on the sea surface the related wave breaking and the interaction between the wind field and the stokes drifting can generate a large amount of turbulent kinetic energy which produces a wave below the sea surface gong et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 the turbulent enhancement zone enhances the rate of turbulence dissipation in the upper ocean therefore the establishment of a relatively complete marine hybrid scheme is an important way to improve the coupled air sea model during typhoons in addition improving the sea surface flux parameterization scheme under strong wind conditions is also an urgent need to improve the model prediction capability ming and zhang 2016 liu et al 2019 the coupling technology dates back to the 1960s and the microscale and mesoscale coupled air sea model began to develop in the 1990s delworth et al 1997 timmermann et al 1998 powers and stoelinga 2000 the first is one way coupling system such as the navy operational regional forecast system noraps combined wind stress forcing and air sea heat flux exchange in the atmospheric model coupled with the shallow water analysis and forecast system swafs in order to overcome the limitations of one way coupling system the naval research laboratory developed a three dimensional coupled ocean atmosphere mesoscale prediction system coamps in 1996 which is a strictly two way coupling model hodur 1997 more and more coupled air sea models have been developed and studied the mesoscale atmospheric model mm5 mesoscale model 5 the ocean circulation model pom princeton ocean model and the wave model wam wave forecasting model were fully coupled by bao et al 2000 and the coupled model was used to simulate the hurricane in the gulf of mexico the triple nested moving grid hurricane model gfdl geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory and the ocean circulation model pom were coupled by bender and ginis 2000 to study the influence of air sea interaction on the intensity of tropical cyclones confirming the mutual the importance of the mechanism of action in the development of typhoons mogensen et al 2017 used the ifs integrated forecasting system of the ecmwf european center for medium range weather forecasts to couple nemo nucleus for european modelling of the ocean to simulate a typhoon on the western pacific the coawst model system was developed by warner et al 2008 2010 which showed that the wave results are sensitive to ocean and atmospheric modes the interaction between waves and currents exists and atmospheric wind stress drives the growth mechanism of waves these studies show that waves play a very important role in the entire air sea interaction guo et al 2016 shao et al 2018 but the mechanism of action remains unclear this paper is the continuation of another paper wu et al 2019a which addressed the coupled atmosphere ocean model and its application in typhoon induced wave and storm surge modelling in the south china sea in the present contribution we aim to analyze and discuss the effects of coupling wave including the different way that waves are coupled on the typhoon induced storm surge processes the coupled wrf swan roms model in the south china sea has been established based on the coawst model system in this study the typhoon wind and pressure field typhoon waves and storm surge under the influence of typhoon kai tak 2012 were simulated based on this coupled model the characteristics of atmospheric wave and oceanic results in the south china sea under the influence of typhoon were calculated the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of the atmospheric wave and oceanic results in the south china sea were analyzed in this study 2 model description and numerical experiments 2 1 model description the detailed coawst model system and setups for simulating typhoon and storm surge in the south china sea has been described in the pioneer paper and another relevant paper wu et al 2019a b the model system consists of three sub models namely wrf swan and roms they were coupled through the mct coupler tightly warner et al 2008 2010 main physical variables exchanged between models are listed as following 1 wrf swan 10 m wind speed u 10 v 10 2 swan wrf sea surface roughness simulated by wave height wave length and wave period using equations 1 and 2 3 wrf roms sea

direction wave length wave period and other wave parameters bottom orbital velocity 6 roms swan topography zeta depth average velocity u a and v a regarding the calculation of sea surface roughness it can be divided into two cases with and without wave influence without wave influence sea surface roughness is computed in wrf based on the charnock 1955 relation of roughness length to wind stress 1 z

the sea surface roughness was calculated by comparison of intensity and wave height the taylor and yelland 2001 method was selected in this study 2 z 0 h s a 1 h s l p b 1 where z 0 is the roughness length h s is the significant wave height m l p is the wave period s a 1 and b 1 are dimensionless constants and calculated by taylor and yelland 2001 to be 1200 and 4 5 respectively 2 2 computational experiments the simulation results of seven different computational schemes in table 1 were used to compare and analyze the effects of storm surge simulation results based on different coupling models including 1 run 1 exp wrf only wrf model was used to simulate the atmospheric processes of typhoon kai tak 2 run 2 exp swan only swan model was used to simulate the waves of typhoon kai tak 3 run 3 exp roms only roms model was used to simulate the oceanic results of typhoon kai tak 4 run 4 exp cws the coupled wrf and swan model was used to simulate the atmospheric results and wave results of typhoon kai tak 5 run 4 exp csr the coupled swan and roms model was used to simulate the wave results and oceanic results of typhoon kai tak 6 run 6 exp cwr the coupled wrf and roms model was used to simulate the atmospheric results and oceanic results of typhoon kai tak 7 run 7 exp cwsr the fully coupled wrf swan and roms model was used to simulate the atmospheric results wave results and oceanic results of typhoon kai tak 3 results and discussions 3 1 distribution of wave height the whole evolution process of the formation development and extinction of typhoon waves in the northern of the south china sea during the typhoon kai tak is shown in fig 1 it can be seen from the figure that a rotating wave field is formed under the influence of the typhoon at 2012 08 16 00 utc typhoon waves began to generate in the study area with the movement of typhoons the wave height gradually increased when the typhoon moves to the north south china sea it generated a huge wave zone with a diameter of over 400 km in which a violent wave zone with a diameter of about 100 km and a wave height of about 8 m is formed near the center of the typhoon when the typhoon landfall the maximum wave height of the typhoon waves was still close to 8 m the wave height on the right side of the typhoon track is greater than the wave height on the left side and the distribution of typhoon waves height exhibited to be spatially asymmetric the variation of typhoon wave height over time in five different characteristic positions had been shown in fig 2 the track of typhoon kai tak the location of five characteristic points and the spatial distribution of typhoon waves at 2012 08 17 06 utc had been shown in fig 2 a the variation of wave height and air pressure at five characteristic positions had been shown in fig 2 b f it can be seen from the figure that the extreme value of the wave height in the near shore region is slightly delayed from the extreme value of the air pressure in order to futher analyze the temporal and spatial asymmetry distribution characteristics of wave height driven by typhoon as shown in fig 2 a the s1 section is selected to plot the spatial and temporal distribution of air pressure and wave height on the section under the influence of typhoon kai tak as shown in fig 3 the black dashed line in the figure is the time corresponding to the extreme value of the air pressure and the extreme value of the wave height and the white dotted line respectively indicates the position corresponding to the extreme value of the air pressure and the extreme value of the wave height the white dotted line in fig 3 b is the position where the extreme value of air pressure appears in fig 3 a it can be seen from the figure that the response of the wave height to the typhoon is slightly delayed in temporal distribution the position of the maximum wave height relative to the extreme position of the air pressure appears about 50 km to the right side of the typhoon track which further demonstrated that the typhoon waves had a spatially asymmetric distribution the simulation results of the wave height driven by the typhoon kai tak in different schemes r4 exp cws and r7 exp cwsr and its comparison with the observation results had been described in fig 4 it can be seen from the figure that under the simulation results based on the fully coupled wrf swan roms model r7 exp cwsr are in good agreement with the observations which can more accurately simulate the evolution of typhoon waves under the influence of the typhoon kai tak 3 2 wave current interactions waves and tidal currents are the two major hydrodynamic factors in the coastal ocean region the interaction mechanism between the wave and tide is very complicated during the typhoon the complex interaction between the storm surge and the waves has a significant impact on the waves height wu et al 2018 the storm surge and the flow field by typhoon which are mainly reflected in the change of time and space will have a significant impact on the wave propagation and breaking it is manifested by the effects of storm water and rotating flow field conditions on typhoon waves the spatial distribution of typhoon waves in the northern of the south china sea obtained by two different coupled schemes r7 exp cwsr and r4 exp cws at 2012 08 17 04 00 00 utc is shown in fig 5 a and b the wave height distributions of the fully coupled wrf swan roms model r7 exp cwsr and coupled wrf swan model r4 exp cws are shown respectively the wave height difference distribution of exp cwsr minus exp cws had been shown in fig 5 c the flow field distribution driven by typhoon at this time had been shown in fig 5 d it can be seen from the figure that at the same time the simulation results of typhoon waves based on r7 exp cwsr and r4 exp cws have similar spatial distributions from the center of the typhoon to the surrounding zone the wave height is decreasing and the wave height on the right side of the typhoon track is larger than the left side however there are obvious differences in the wave height based on the two different schemes the maximum wave height obtained in the r4 exp cws can reach 10 m and the maximum wave height obtained in the fully coupled wrf swan roms model is less than 8 m therefore this phenomenon indicated that the wave height is significantly reduced after coupling into the roms model with a reduction of more than 2 m the impact of storm surge on typhoon waves is actually the result of the combined effects of storm water and currents due to the movement of the typhoon center and the coriolis force there is an asymmetric distribution of the wind field driven by typhoon which is a larger wind speed on the right side of the typhoon track and a smaller wind speed on the left side therefore the storm water and surface current caused by the typhoon also show the characteristics of asymmetric distribution stronger in the right side and weaker in the left side as shown in fig 5 d under the influence of the typhoon kai tak the direction of the surface current driven by the typhoon is consistent with the direction of the typhoon wave therefore the existence of surface current reduces the wind time and fetch of typhoon waves which inhibited the development of typhoon waves and the strong doppler effect reduces the typhoon waves height the results of this study are the same as those of fan et al 2009 but contrary to the results of warner et al 2010 the reason is the direction of storm current is the same as that of typhoon waves caused by hurricane ivan 2004 in fan et al 2009 so the conclusions of this study are similar in the study by warner et al 2010 the direction of the storm current caused by the typhoon is opposite to that of the typhoon wave therefore the conclusions of this study are different 3 3 storm surge the sea level evolution process in the northern of the south china sea under the influence of the typhoon kai tak based on the fully coupled wrf swan roms model r7 scheme had been simulated in this study for comparison the sea level at each moment is subtracted from the initial sea level before the impact of the typhoon at 2012 08 15 00 00 00 utc and the result of storm surge under the influence of the typhoon is obtained as shown in fig 6 as can be seen from fig 6 starting from 2012 to 08 16 00 utc under the influence of the typhoon kai tak the northern of the south china sea began to produce a more obvious process of storm surge with the development of the typhoon the sea level will increase accordingly on the southwest coastal ocean of the pearl river estuary the maximum storm surge reached about 1 5 m similar to the spatial asymmetry distribution of the typhoon waves the storm surge on the right side of the typhoon track is greater than the storm surge on the left side and the storm surge also exhibits the asymmetry distribution feature in space in order to further analyze the storm surge process five characteristic locations were selected near the track of typhoon kai tak as shown in fig 7 a and the storm surge process was recorded the storm surge and typhoon pressure over time for each characteristic location had been reflected in fig 7 b f it can be seen from the figures that the moment of the maximum storm surge at each characteristic location is substantially synchronized with the moment of the minimum sea level pressure and does not exhibit temporal lag the s1 section is been selected in the northern of the south china sea as shown in fig 7 a the temporal and spatial distribution of the sea level pressure and storm surge on the s1 under the influence of the typhoon kai tak is plotted as shown in fig 8 the black horizontal dashed lines in the figure indicate the time corresponding to the extreme value of the pressure and the extreme value of the storm surge the white vertical dashed lines indicate the position corresponding to the extreme value of the pressure and storm surge respectively the white vertical dotted line in fig 8 b is the position of the pressure extreme value in fig 8 a it can be seen from fig 8 that the response of storm surge to the typhoon is basically the same as the change of air pressure without temporal lag however the location of the maximum storm surge occurs about 30 km to the right of the extreme pressure position which is 30 km to the right of the typhoon track therefore it is further illustrated that the response of storm surge to typhoon has spatial asymmetry distribution characteristics the main cause of the asymmetric distribution of storm surges is due to the influence of coriolis force during the movement of the typhoon the typhoon wind field is not symmetrically distributed along the center of the typhoon the wind speed in the right front area of the typhoon center is larger and the wind speed in the left rear is smaller therefore the storm surges and surface current caused by the typhoon are larger and stronger in the right front of the typhoon and smaller and weaker in the left rear the storm surge process of the three characteristic locations in fig 7 a in the r6 exp cwr and r7 exp cwsr is shown in fig 9 it can be seen from the figure that the storm surge process calculated under the two schemes is basically the same in the nearshore zone the effect of wave induced radiation stress is relatively obvious at the p1 and p2 locations a storm surge of more than 0 1 m is caused and the maximum storm surge can reach 0 18 m accounting for 9 6 of the total sea level 1 88 m however the impact at other times is small and the magnitude of the change is basically no more than 0 05 m therefore it can be considered that under the extreme conditions of storm surge caused by typhoon the effect of wave induced radiation stress on the extreme value of storm surge is obvious the amplitude of the wave impact on the storm surge is close to 10 and the maximum radiation stress occurs at the time of the extreme storm surge 3 4 flow field under the influence of the typhoon a strong rotating wind field is formed above the sea surface and large typhoon waves and storm surges are generated on the sea which will inevitably affect the flow field of the sea surface the surface flow field of the south china sea during the typhoon kai tak is shown in fig 10 it can be seen from the figure that due to the influence of the typhoon kai tak the local flow field in the surface of the south china sea has undergone significant changes on the sea surface a low flow velocity zone is formed on the left side of the typhoon track red box in fig 10 b d the flow velocity is less than 0 2 m s and the local flow velocity is even smaller a large horizontal velocity is generated on both sides of the low flow velocity zone and the direction of flow velocity in this zone is opposite to the direction of flow velocity in the low flow velocity zone the flow velocity on the right side of the typhoon track is about twice as large as the left side and the maximum flow velocity on the right side is 2 0 m s which is generated in the right rear tail area of the typhoon the maximum flow velocity on the left side is about 0 8 m s and the local low flow velocity zone is split to the boundary on both sides and an obvious counterclockwise circulation flow field is formed near the center of the typhoon it can be seen from fig 10 a d that the flow velocity on the right side of the circulation flow field is obviously stronger than the flow velocity on the left side that is the flow field driven by typhoon also has spatially asymmetric distribution characteristics the pressure distribution at the corresponding moment had been shown in fig 10 e and f the circle in the figure is the center of the typhoon and the triangle is the center of the flow field as can be seen from the figure the center of the flow field is located at the right rear of the center of the typhoon and the location of the maximum velocity is also located at the right rear of the center of the typhoon therefore it can be seen that the flow field caused by typhoon has an obvious characteristic of time lag the flow field of the four different layers under the influence of the typhoon kai tak had been shown in fig 11 included sea surface and water depth is d 30 m d 60 m and d 90 m in the northern of the south china sea the arrows in the figure indicate the velocity vector color is the sea level and the medium depth lines are 30 m 60 m and 90 m respectively it can be seen from the figure that the distinct rotating flow field had been produced in the sea surface layer and the d 30 m layer under the influence of the typhoon while the rotating characteristics of the flow field in the d 60 m layer are not obvious and the phenomenon cannot be observed in the d 90 m layer the velocity in the d 30 m is slightly smaller than the surface velocity and the flow velocity of the d 60 m layer and the d 90 m layer is significantly smaller than that of the surface layer and the d 30 m layer therefore it can be preliminarily determined that the depth of the mixed layer under the influence of the typhoon kai tak is about 60 m in the study zone and the depth of the mixed layer will be further analyzed in the section 3 3 6 to analyze the vertical distribution characteristics of the flow velocity under the influence of typhoon the s1 section was been selected according to fig 10 c f and the vertical velocity distribution at the two moments before and after typhoon was been plotted as shown in fig 12 as can be seen from fig 10 c at 2012 08 17 00 00 00 utc the typhoon center will pass through the s1 section at this time a flow velocity of about 2 m s is generated on the s1 section on the right front side of the typhoon center which corresponds to the surface flow velocity extreme value in fig 12 a with the sea surface to the deep the flow velocity is drastically reduced below 50 m water depth and the flow velocity is less than 0 3 m s it can be seen from fig 10 f at 2012 08 17 00 00 00 utc the typhoon center had passed through section s1 from fig 10 d it is found that the s1 section velocity is less than 1 5 m s which was consistent to fig 12 b but at this time the bottom water of this zone has been disturbed it can be found that the flow velocity is still about 0 6 m s below 50 m water depth and the flow velocity is maintained to the bottom therefore it can be found that the depth of the mixed layer increased under the influence of the typhoon and the response of the middle and bottom water to the typhoon has a temporal lag characteristic 3 5 sea surface stress the sea surface shear stress will be generated on the surface of the ocean due to the strong rotation of air under the influence of typhoon which is one of the important relationships between sea air interactions the shear stress caused by the typhoon kai tak in the longitudinal and latitudinal components of the northern of the south china sea at two characteristic moments based on the fully coupled wrf swan roms scheme r7 exp cwsr had been shown in fig 13 at 2012 08 16 12 00 00 utc the sea surface stress in the latitudinal direction is about 3 n m2 and the shear stress component in the longitudinal direction is slightly larger about 4 n m2 with the development of the typhoon the typhoon intensity increased at 2012 08 17 00 00 00 utc the sea surface shear stress increased in the latitudinal direction to above 4 n m2 and the shear stress in the longitudinal direction increased to 5 n m2 it can be seen from the figure that the shear stress on the right side of the typhoon track is larger than the left side of the typhoon track in both the longitudinal and latitudinal directions that is the sea surface shear stress also has a spatial asymmetric distribution because the sea surface shear stress is caused by the relative motion of the typhoon and the sea surface it can be understood that the sea surface shear stress increases with the increase of the wind field it is easy to understand that the spatial distribution of the sea surface shear stress field also has this asymmetric characteristic because there is a spatial asymmetric distribution characteristic in the wind field the comparison of sea surface shear stress in the coupled wrf roms model r6 exp cwr and the fully coupled wrf swan roms model r7 exp cwsr at 2012 08 17 00 00 00 utc had been shown in fig 14 it can be seen from the figure that in the fully coupled model due to the addition of the wave model the rough length z 0 in formula 2 is increased which caused the sea surface shear stress increased as a result the wind field is weakened and the wave height is reduced see section 3 1 but the sea surface shear stress is increased 3 6 heat flux the heat exchange between the air and sea is divided into latent heat and sensible heat the latent heat flux is the release heat due to evaporation of water vapor that is the heat generated by the evaporation of water vapor from the sea surface to the air and its value is negative the sensible heat flux is the amount of heat transport due to the difference temperature in the sea and air and its value is positive or negative when it is positive the heat is from sea to the air when it is negative the air delivers heat to the sea the spatial distribution of latent heat flux at different times in the northern of the south china sea during the influence of the typhoon kai tak based on the fully coupled wrf swan roms model r7 exp cwsr had been shown in fig 15 it can be seen from the figure that the extreme value of the latent heat flux appears near the center of the typhoon and can reach around 500 w m2 in the coastal ocean zone the latent heat flux at the time of typhoon land falling can exceed 600 w m2 the spatial distribution of the sensible heat flux had been shown in fig 16 it can be seen from the figure that the extreme value of the sensible heat flux also appears near the center of the typhoon and is negative about 100 w m2 near 100 km around the center of the typhoon the sensible heat flux is positive and the sensible heat flux value of the 100 km area outside the typhoon center is about 50 w m2 the comparison of latent heat and sensible heat in two different schemes had been shown in fig 17 by comparing the latent heat flux with the sensible heat flux it can be found that during the influence of the typhoon kai tak the heat exchange of the sea and air is mainly from latent heat this shows that the heat exchange at the sea air interface is very strong under the influence of the typhoon and the heat release from the evaporation of water vapor plays a leading role in the heat exchange at the air sea interface it also shows that under the influence of typhoon the heat taken away by the evaporation of water vapor from the sea surface is one of the important factors for the decline of sea temperature the water vapor evaporation enhances the strong prevalence in the typhoon rain belt leading to the precipitation be increased it can be found from fig 17 that the spatial distribution characteristics of the simulated sensible heat flux and latent heat flux are similar in both models and both exhibit an asymmetric ring structure in terms of the results of numerical simulation the sensible heat flux and latent heat flux in the fully coupled model r7 exp cwsr are relatively smaller than the simulation results of the coupled wrf roms model r6 exp cwr this is due to the fact that under the influence of waves the heat exchange between the sea surface and the bottom water is enhanced and so the heat exchange to the air was relative decreased and thus the sensible heat flux and latent heat flux based on the fully coupled wrf swan roms model r7 exp cwsr both were relatively smaller than the coupled wrf roms model r6 exp cwr 4 conclusions the fully coupled atmosphere wave ocean model over the south china sea based on the mct is established and applied to the simulation of the storm surge in the south china sea under the influence of the typhoon kai tak in this study the fully coupled model has been used to calculate the spatial and temporal distribution of typhoon waves induced by typhoon kai tak the numerical results showed that the typhoon waves have spatial asymmetric distribution characteristics in view of the complex interaction between storm surge and typhoon waves the impact of storm surge on typhoon waves had been discussed under the influence of typhoon kai tak the surface currents caused by typhoon is consistent with the direction of typhoon waves the existence of surface currents reduces the fetch of typhoon waves thus inhibiting the growth of typhoon waves the strong doppler effect made typhoon waves height reduced it was further shown that the fully coupled model has better accuracy in typhoon wave simulation the numerical simulation results show that the spatial and temporal distribution of storm surge and three dimensional flow field had the characteristics of time lag and spatial asymmetric distribution the results of spatial and temporal distribution based on different coupled schemes had been compared based on the analysis of the coupled relationship between the atmospheric waves and oceanic factors under the influence of typhoon the spatial and temporal asymmetry distribution mechanism of typhoon waves and storm surges is explained in detail author contributions section zhiyuan wu

22199,continuing along the path of previous papers in this series this paper describes numerical work to investigate seven different computational schemes of wave impact on the typhoon processes investigations showed that the wave dynamics factor is the most severe impact factors and should therefore be considered for coupling atmosphere ocean interaction during a typhoon the simulation results reveal the temporal and spatial distribution of typhoons field pressure field typhoon waves storm surges wind induced flow field sea surface stress and heat flux typhoon waves have a spatial asymmetrical distribution the storm surges and flow field have asymmetrical distribution in space and has lag in time this paper is a companion paper to numerical investigation of typhoon kai tak 1213 using a mesoscale coupled wrf roms model keywords storm surge typhoon waves sea air interaction fully coupled atmosphere wave ocean model coawst model system 1 introduction the typhoons are strong tropical cyclones that occur in tropical and subtropical oceans yang et al 2018 the tropical cyclones have the greatest impact on three sea areas around the world the pacific northwest typhoons the northwest atlantic hurricanes and the bay of bengal tropical storms bhalachandran et al 2019 fan et al 2019 the response and feedback of the ocean to typhoons is the strongest air sea interaction involving complex processes from weather to climate scales from local to global from dynamics and thermodynamics to multiple environmental variables ge et al 2017 dai et al 2018 ma et al 2019 wu et al 2019a b wei et al 2019 the typhoon process is essentially a process of strong air sea interaction on the one hand the physical process of typhoon suction and entrainment brings cold water to the mixed layer through the upwelling which makes the sea surface temperature sst significantly reduced nakamura et al 2016 kanada et al 2017 pun et al 2018 on the other hand the reduced sst also reduces the transfer of latent and sensible heat of the sea to the air and also reduces the intensity of the typhoon kolstad et al 2016 wu et al 2019c sun et al 2019 the response mechanism of the oceans to typhoons can be considered from two aspects first the typhoon driven mesoscale three dimensional ocean circulation will have a significant impact on the local dynamics and thermal processes zhang et al 2016 chen et al 2017 sun et al 2019 the resulting near inertial internal waves and vortices can input a large amount of mechanical energy into the ocean thus significantly enhancing the local ocean mixes and changes the thermohaline structure of the upper ocean lu et al 2016 wang et al 2016 yang et al 2019 second in the interior ocean the energy input into the ocean by typhoons in the form of near inertial internal waves travels along the oceanic thermocline to the distant such as the tropical pacific mei et al 2015 pei et al 2015 during the propagation process they interact nonlinearly with the original internal waves and near inertial oscillations inside the ocean which affects the ocean basin scale and even the global energy distribution and leads to an increase in ocean mixing rate in some specific regions the state of the art models have a good forecasting ability for the typhoon track but the forecast of typhoon intensity is still a recognized problem in the international meteorological community jin et al 2008 wu and zhao 2012 bender et al 2017 wu et al 2019d the reason is that besides the understanding of the atmospheric environment and the structure of the typhoon itself is not accurate enough it is also one of the important reasons for the lack of understanding of the complexity and feedback of related ocean dynamics and thermal processes wei et al 2017 kuo et al 2018 when the typhoon transits it exerts great shearing force on the sea surface the related wave breaking and the interaction between the wind field and the stokes drifting can generate a large amount of turbulent kinetic energy which produces a wave below the sea surface gong et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 the turbulent enhancement zone enhances the rate of turbulence dissipation in the upper ocean therefore the establishment of a relatively complete marine hybrid scheme is an important way to improve the coupled air sea model during typhoons in addition improving the sea surface flux parameterization scheme under strong wind conditions is also an urgent need to improve the model prediction capability ming and zhang 2016 liu et al 2019 the coupling technology dates back to the 1960s and the microscale and mesoscale coupled air sea model began to develop in the 1990s delworth et al 1997 timmermann et al 1998 powers and stoelinga 2000 the first is one way coupling system such as the navy operational regional forecast system noraps combined wind stress forcing and air sea heat flux exchange in the atmospheric model coupled with the shallow water analysis and forecast system swafs in order to overcome the limitations of one way coupling system the naval research laboratory developed a three dimensional coupled ocean atmosphere mesoscale prediction system coamps in 1996

triple nested moving grid hurricane model gfdl geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory and the ocean circulation model pom were coupled by bender and ginis 2000 to study the influence of air sea interaction on the intensity of tropical cyclones confirming the mutual the importance of the mechanism of action in the development of typhoons mogensen et al 2017 used the ifs integrated forecasting system of the ecmwf european center for medium range weather forecasts to couple nemo nucleus for european modelling of the ocean to simulate a typhoon on the western pacific the coawst model system was developed by warner et al 2008 2010 which showed that the wave results are sensitive to ocean and atmospheric modes the interaction between waves and currents exists and atmospheric wind stress drives the growth mechanism of waves these studies show that waves play a very important role in the entire air sea interaction guo et al 2016 shao et al 2018 but the mechanism of action remains unclear this paper is the continuation of another paper wu et al 2019a which addressed the coupled atmosphere ocean model and its application in typhoon induced wave and storm surge modelling in the south china sea in the present contribution we aim to analyze and discuss the effects of coupling wave including the different way that waves are coupled on the typhoon induced storm surge processes the coupled wrf swan roms model in the south china sea has been established based on the coawst model system in this study the typhoon wind and pressure field typhoon waves and storm surge under the influence of typhoon kai tak 2012 were simulated based on this coupled model the characteristics of atmospheric wave and oceanic results in the south china sea under the influence of typhoon were calculated the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of the atmospheric wave and oceanic results in the south china sea were analyzed in this study 2 model description and numerical experiments 2 1 model description the detailed coawst model system and setups for simulating typhoon and storm surge in the south china sea has been described in the pioneer paper and another relevant paper wu et al 2019a b the model system consists of three sub models namely wrf swan and roms they were coupled through the mct coupler tightly warner et al 2008 2010 main physical variables exchanged

experiments the simulation results of seven different computational schemes in table 1 were used to compare and analyze the effects of storm surge simulation results based on different coupling models including 1 run 1 exp wrf only wrf model was used to simulate the atmospheric processes of typhoon kai tak 2 run 2 exp swan only swan model was used to simulate the waves of typhoon kai tak 3 run 3

simulate the atmospheric results and oceanic results of typhoon kai tak 7 run 7 exp cwsr the fully coupled wrf swan and roms model was used to simulate the atmospheric results wave results and oceanic results of typhoon kai tak 3 results and discussions 3 1 distribution of wave height the whole evolution process of the formation development and extinction of typhoon waves in the northern of the south china sea during the typhoon kai tak is shown in fig 1 it can be seen from the figure that a rotating wave field is formed under the influence of the typhoon at 2012 08 16 00 utc typhoon waves began to generate in the study area with the movement of typhoons the wave height gradually increased when the typhoon moves to the north south china sea it generated a huge wave zone with a diameter of over 400 km in which a violent wave zone with a diameter of about 100 km and a wave height of about 8 m is formed near the center of the typhoon when the typhoon landfall the maximum wave height of the typhoon waves was still close to 8 m the wave height on the right side of the typhoon track is greater than the wave height on the left side and the distribution of typhoon waves height exhibited to be spatially asymmetric the variation of typhoon wave height over time in five different characteristic positions had been shown in fig 2 the track of typhoon kai tak the location of five characteristic points and the spatial distribution of typhoon waves at 2012 08 17 06 utc had been shown in fig 2 a the variation of wave height and air pressure at five characteristic positions had been shown in fig 2 b f it can be seen from the figure that the extreme value of the wave height in the near shore region is slightly delayed from the extreme value of the air pressure in order to futher analyze the temporal and spatial asymmetry distribution characteristics of wave height driven by typhoon as shown in fig 2 a the s1 section is selected to plot the spatial and temporal distribution of air pressure and wave height on the section under the influence of typhoon kai tak as shown in fig 3 the black dashed line in the figure is the time corresponding to the extreme value of the air pressure and the extreme value of the wave height and the white dotted line respectively indicates the position corresponding to the extreme value of the air pressure and the extreme value of the wave height the white dotted line in fig 3 b is the position where the extreme value of air pressure appears in fig 3 a it can be seen from the figure that the response of the wave height to the typhoon is slightly delayed in temporal distribution the position of the maximum wave height relative to the extreme position of the air pressure appears about 50 km to the right side of the typhoon track which further demonstrated that the typhoon waves had a spatially asymmetric distribution the simulation results of the wave height driven by the typhoon kai tak in different schemes r4 exp cws and r7 exp cwsr and its comparison with the observation results had been described in fig 4 it can be seen from the figure that under the simulation results based on the fully coupled wrf swan roms model r7 exp cwsr are in good agreement with the observations which can more accurately simulate the evolution of typhoon waves under the influence of the typhoon kai tak 3 2 wave current interactions waves and tidal currents are the two major hydrodynamic factors in the coastal ocean region the interaction mechanism between the wave and tide is very complicated during the typhoon the complex interaction between the storm surge and the waves has a significant impact on the waves height wu et al 2018 the storm surge and the flow field by typhoon which are mainly reflected in the change of time and space will have a significant impact on the wave propagation and breaking it is manifested by the effects of storm water and rotating flow field conditions on typhoon waves the spatial distribution of typhoon waves in the northern of the south china sea obtained by two different coupled schemes r7 exp cwsr and r4 exp cws at 2012 08 17 04 00 00 utc is shown in fig 5 a and b the wave height distributions of the fully coupled wrf swan roms model r7 exp cwsr and coupled wrf swan model r4 exp cws are shown respectively the wave height difference distribution of exp cwsr minus exp cws had been shown in fig 5 c the flow field distribution driven by typhoon at this time had been shown in fig 5 d it can be seen from the figure that at the same time the simulation results of typhoon waves based on r7 exp cwsr and r4 exp cws have similar spatial distributions from the center of the typhoon to the surrounding zone the wave height is decreasing and the wave height on the right side of the typhoon track is larger than the left side however there are obvious differences in the wave height based on the two different schemes the maximum wave height obtained in the r4 exp cws can reach 10 m and the maximum wave height obtained in the fully coupled wrf swan roms model is less than 8 m therefore this phenomenon indicated that the wave height is significantly reduced after coupling into the roms model with a reduction of more than 2 m the impact of storm surge on typhoon waves is actually the result of the combined effects of storm water and currents due to the movement of the typhoon center and the coriolis force there is an asymmetric distribution of the wind field driven by typhoon which is a larger wind speed on the right side of the typhoon track and a smaller wind speed on the left side therefore the storm water and surface current caused by the typhoon also show the characteristics of asymmetric distribution stronger in the right side and weaker in the left side as shown in fig 5 d under the influence of the typhoon kai tak the direction of the surface current driven by the typhoon is consistent with the direction of the typhoon wave therefore the existence of surface current reduces the wind time and fetch of typhoon waves which inhibited the development of typhoon waves and the strong doppler effect reduces the typhoon waves height the results of this study are the same as those of fan et al 2009 but contrary to the results of warner et al 2010 the reason is the direction of storm current is the same as that of typhoon waves caused by hurricane ivan 2004 in fan et al 2009 so the conclusions of this study are similar in the study by warner et al 2010 the direction of the storm current caused by the typhoon is opposite to that of the typhoon wave therefore the conclusions of this study are different 3 3 storm surge the sea level evolution process in the northern of the south china sea under the influence of the typhoon kai tak based on the fully coupled wrf swan roms model r7 scheme had been simulated in this study for comparison the sea level at each moment is subtracted from the initial sea level before the impact of the typhoon at 2012 08 15 00 00 00 utc and the result of storm surge under the influence of the typhoon is obtained as shown in fig 6 as can be seen from fig 6 starting from 2012 to 08 16 00 utc under the influence of the typhoon kai tak the northern of the south china sea began to produce a more obvious process of storm surge with the development of the typhoon the sea level will increase accordingly on the southwest coastal ocean of the pearl river estuary the maximum storm surge reached about 1 5 m similar to the spatial asymmetry distribution of the typhoon waves the storm surge on the right side of the typhoon track is greater than the storm surge on the left side and the storm surge also exhibits the asymmetry distribution feature in space in order to further analyze the storm surge process five characteristic locations were selected near the track of typhoon kai tak as shown in fig 7 a and the storm surge process was recorded the storm surge and typhoon pressure over time for each characteristic location had been reflected in fig 7 b f it can be seen from the figures that the moment of the maximum storm surge at each characteristic location is substantially synchronized with the moment of the minimum sea level pressure and does not exhibit temporal lag the s1 section is been selected in the northern of the south china sea as shown in fig 7 a the temporal and spatial distribution of the sea level pressure and storm surge on the s1 under the influence of the typhoon kai tak is plotted as shown in fig 8 the black horizontal dashed lines in the figure indicate the time corresponding to the extreme value of the pressure and the extreme value of the storm surge the white vertical dashed lines indicate the position corresponding to the extreme value of the pressure and storm surge respectively the white vertical dotted line in fig 8 b is the position of the pressure extreme value in fig 8 a it can be seen from fig 8 that the response of storm surge to the typhoon is basically the same as the change of air pressure without temporal lag however the location of the maximum storm surge occurs about 30 km to the right of the extreme pressure position which is 30 km to the right of the typhoon track therefore it is further illustrated that the response of storm surge to typhoon has spatial asymmetry distribution characteristics the main cause of the asymmetric distribution of storm surges is due to the influence of coriolis force during the movement of the typhoon the typhoon wind field is not symmetrically distributed along the center of the typhoon the wind speed in the right front area of the typhoon center is larger and the wind speed in the left rear is smaller therefore the storm surges and surface current caused by the typhoon are larger and stronger in the right front of the typhoon and smaller and weaker in the left rear the storm surge process of the three characteristic locations in fig 7 a in the r6 exp cwr and r7 exp cwsr is shown in fig 9 it can be seen from the figure that the storm surge process calculated under the two schemes is basically the same in the nearshore zone the effect of wave induced radiation stress is relatively obvious at the p1 and p2 locations a storm surge of more than 0 1 m is caused and the maximum storm surge can reach 0 18 m accounting for 9 6 of the total sea level 1 88 m however the impact at other times is small and the magnitude of the change is basically no more than 0 05 m therefore it can be considered that under the extreme conditions of storm surge caused by typhoon the effect of wave induced radiation stress on the extreme value of storm surge is obvious the amplitude of the wave impact on the storm surge is close to 10 and the maximum radiation stress occurs at the time of the extreme storm surge 3 4 flow field under the influence of the typhoon a strong rotating wind field is formed above the sea surface and large typhoon waves and storm surges are generated on the sea which will inevitably affect the flow field of the sea surface the surface flow field of the south china sea during the typhoon kai tak is shown in fig 10 it can be seen from the figure that due to the influence of the typhoon kai tak the local flow field in the surface of the south china sea has undergone significant changes on the sea surface a low flow velocity zone is formed on the left side of the typhoon track red box in fig 10 b d the flow velocity is less than 0 2 m s and the local flow velocity is even smaller a large horizontal velocity is generated on both sides of the low flow velocity zone and the direction of flow velocity in this zone is opposite to the direction of flow velocity in the low flow velocity zone the flow velocity on the right side of the typhoon track is about twice as large as the left side and the maximum flow velocity on the right side is 2 0 m s which is generated in the right rear tail area of the typhoon the maximum flow velocity on the left side is about 0 8 m s and the local low flow velocity zone is split to the boundary on both sides and an obvious counterclockwise circulation flow field is formed near the center of the typhoon it can be seen from fig 10 a d that the flow velocity on the right side of the circulation flow field is obviously stronger than the flow velocity on the left side that is the flow field driven by typhoon also has spatially asymmetric distribution characteristics the pressure distribution at the corresponding moment had been shown in fig 10 e and f the circle in the figure is the center of the typhoon and the triangle is the center of the flow field as can be seen from the figure the center of the flow field is located at the right rear of the center of the typhoon and the location of the maximum velocity is also located at the right rear of the center of the typhoon therefore it can be seen that the flow field caused by typhoon has an obvious characteristic of time lag the flow field of the four different layers under the influence of the typhoon kai tak had been shown in fig 11 included sea surface and water depth is d 30 m d 60 m and d 90 m in the northern of the south china sea the arrows in the figure indicate the velocity vector color is the sea level and the medium depth lines are 30 m 60 m and 90 m respectively it can be seen from the figure that the distinct rotating flow field had been produced in the sea surface layer and the d 30 m layer under the influence of the typhoon while the rotating characteristics of the flow field in the d 60 m layer are not obvious and the phenomenon cannot be observed in the d 90 m layer the velocity in the d 30 m is slightly smaller than the surface velocity and the flow velocity of the d 60 m layer and the d 90 m layer is significantly smaller than that of the surface layer and the d 30 m layer therefore it can be preliminarily determined that the depth of the mixed layer under the influence of the typhoon kai tak is about 60 m in the study zone and the depth of the mixed layer will be further analyzed in the section 3 3 6 to analyze the vertical distribution characteristics of the flow velocity under the influence of typhoon the s1 section was been selected according to fig 10 c f and the vertical velocity distribution at the two moments before and after typhoon was been plotted as shown in fig 12 as can be seen from fig 10 c at 2012 08 17 00 00 00 utc the typhoon center will pass through the s1 section at this time a flow velocity of about 2 m s is generated on the s1 section on the right front side of the typhoon center which corresponds to the surface flow velocity extreme value in fig 12 a with the sea surface to the deep the flow velocity is drastically reduced below 50 m water depth and the flow velocity is less than 0 3 m s it can be seen from fig 10 f at 2012 08 17 00 00 00 utc the typhoon center had passed through section s1 from fig 10 d it is found that the s1 section velocity is less than 1 5 m s which was consistent to fig 12 b but at this time the bottom water of this zone has been disturbed it can be found that the flow velocity is still about 0 6 m s below 50 m water depth and the flow velocity is maintained to the bottom therefore it can be found that the depth of the mixed layer increased under the influence of the typhoon and the response of the middle and bottom water to the typhoon has a temporal lag characteristic 3 5 sea surface stress the sea surface shear stress will be generated on the surface of the ocean due to the strong rotation of air under the influence of typhoon which is one of the important relationships between sea air interactions the shear stress caused by the typhoon kai tak in the longitudinal and latitudinal components of the northern of the south china sea at two characteristic moments based on the fully coupled wrf swan roms scheme r7 exp cwsr had been shown in fig 13 at 2012 08 16 12 00 00 utc the sea surface stress in the latitudinal direction is about 3 n m2 and the shear stress component in the longitudinal direction is slightly larger about 4 n m2 with the development of the typhoon the typhoon intensity increased at 2012 08 17 00 00 00 utc the sea surface shear stress increased in the latitudinal direction to above 4 n m2 and the shear stress in the longitudinal direction increased to 5 n m2 it can be seen from the figure that the shear stress on the right side of the typhoon track is larger than the left side of the typhoon track in both the longitudinal and latitudinal directions that is the sea surface shear stress also has a spatial asymmetric distribution because the sea surface shear stress is caused by the relative motion of the typhoon and the sea surface it can be understood that the sea surface shear stress increases with the increase of the wind field it is easy to understand that the spatial distribution of the sea surface shear stress field also has this asymmetric characteristic because there is a spatial asymmetric distribution characteristic in the wind field the comparison of sea surface shear stress in the coupled wrf roms model r6 exp cwr and the fully coupled wrf swan roms model r7 exp cwsr at 2012 08 17 00 00 00 utc had been shown in fig 14 it can be seen from the figure that in the fully coupled model due to the addition of the wave model the rough length z 0 in formula 2 is increased which caused the sea surface shear stress increased as a result the wind field is weakened and the wave height is reduced see section 3 1 but the sea surface shear stress is increased 3 6 heat flux the heat exchange between the air and sea is divided into latent heat and sensible heat the latent heat flux is the release heat due to evaporation of water vapor that is the heat generated by the evaporation of water vapor from the sea surface to the air and its value is negative the sensible heat flux is the amount of heat transport due to the difference temperature in the sea and air and its value is positive or negative when it is positive the heat is from sea to the air when it is negative the air delivers heat to the sea the spatial distribution of latent heat flux at different times in the northern of the south china sea during the influence of the typhoon kai tak based on the fully coupled wrf swan roms model r7 exp cwsr had been shown in fig 15 it can be seen from the figure that the extreme value of the latent heat flux appears near the center of the typhoon and can reach around 500 w m2 in the coastal ocean zone the latent heat flux at the time of typhoon land falling can exceed 600 w m2 the spatial distribution of the sensible heat flux had been shown in fig 16 it can be seen from the figure that the extreme value of the sensible heat flux also appears near the center of the typhoon and is negative about 100 w m2 near 100 km around the center of the typhoon the sensible heat flux is positive and the sensible heat flux value of the 100 km area outside the typhoon center is about 50 w m2 the comparison of latent heat and sensible heat in two different schemes had been shown in fig 17 by comparing the latent heat flux with the sensible heat flux it can be found that during the influence of the typhoon kai tak the heat exchange of the sea and air is mainly from latent heat this shows that the heat exchange at the sea air interface is very strong under the influence of the typhoon and the heat release from the evaporation of water vapor plays a leading role in the heat exchange at the air sea interface it also shows that under the influence of typhoon the heat taken away by the evaporation of water vapor from the sea surface is one of the important factors for the decline of sea temperature the water vapor evaporation enhances the strong prevalence in the typhoon rain belt leading to the precipitation be increased it can be found from fig 17 that the spatial distribution characteristics of the simulated sensible heat flux and latent heat flux are similar in both models and both exhibit an asymmetric ring structure in terms of the results of numerical simulation the sensible heat flux and latent heat flux in the fully coupled model r7 exp cwsr are relatively smaller than the simulation results of the coupled wrf roms model r6 exp cwr this is due to the fact that under the influence of waves the heat exchange between the sea surface and the bottom water is enhanced and so the heat exchange to the air was relative decreased and thus the sensible heat flux and latent heat flux based on the fully coupled wrf swan roms model r7 exp cwsr both were relatively smaller than the coupled wrf roms model r6 exp cwr 4 conclusions the fully coupled atmosphere wave ocean model over the south china sea based on the mct is established and applied to the simulation of the storm surge in the south china sea under the influence of the typhoon kai tak in this study the fully coupled model has been used to calculate the spatial and temporal distribution of typhoon waves induced by typhoon kai tak the numerical results showed that the typhoon waves have spatial asymmetric distribution characteristics in view of the complex interaction between storm surge and typhoon waves the impact of storm surge on typhoon waves had been discussed under the influence of typhoon kai tak the surface currents caused by typhoon is consistent with the direction of typhoon waves the existence of surface currents reduces the fetch of typhoon waves thus inhibiting the growth of typhoon waves the strong doppler effect made typhoon waves height reduced it was further shown that the fully coupled model has better accuracy in typhoon wave simulation the numerical simulation results show that the spatial and temporal distribution of storm surge and three dimensional flow field had the characteristics of time lag and spatial asymmetric distribution the results of spatial and temporal distribution based on different coupled schemes had been compared based on the analysis of the coupled relationship between the atmospheric waves and oceanic factors under the influence of typhoon the spatial and temporal asymmetry distribution mechanism of typhoon waves and storm surges is explained in detail author contributions section zhiyuan wu
